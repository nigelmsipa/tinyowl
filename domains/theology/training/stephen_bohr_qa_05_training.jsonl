{"instruction": "What is the church's position regarding ministers\u2014especially pastors\u2014eating animal flesh? Has the counsel from Ellen White on health reform been neglected?", "input": "", "output": "Not a test of fellowship; ministers should model health reform. Ellen White repeatedly wrote that eating flesh foods is not a test of fellowship\u2014members who eat clean meat are not to be disfellowshipped. Nevertheless she urges that ministers should be examples of the health message. In Pastoral Ministry she asks whether those who claim to proclaim the most solemn truth \"make the stomach a cesspool\" by indulging appetite; she pleads with ministers to avoid flesh foods and live up to the light of health reform. Her advice is part of a broader call to practise all eight laws of health\u2014moderation, exercise, rest, sunlight and good nutrition. Ministers raised on meat may find abstinence difficult (even Ellen White struggled), but victory comes through Christ. Congregations should encourage pastors kindly rather than criticising; harshness hardens hearts. Eating flesh is not a salvation issue, but ministers are called to model a plant\u2011based diet and teach health reform."}
{"instruction": "Could you briefly explain Last Generation Theology (LGT)? Must the final generation exhibit those characteristics before Christ can return?", "input": "", "output": "Sin is choice; victory is possible through Christ. The discussion begins by defining sin as \"the transgression of the law\" (1 John 3:4). We are sinners by choice, not by some unavoidable state; guilt comes when a person knowingly disobeys. Last Generation Theology teaches that the final generation will, through Christ, fully reflect His character. They will keep God's commandments and demonstrate Christ\u2011like love (Revelation 14:12; Romans 13:8\u201110). This obedience is not self\u2011generated but the fruit of abiding in Christ (John 15). Ellen White notes that before probation closes Jesus' followers will overcome known sin by His grace; after the verdict of Revelation 22:11 characters are fixed, so we must surrender now. LGT is not about earning salvation\u2014victory over sin is possible only through Christ's righteousness and should inspire humility, not pride. We should avoid date\u2011setting and live in constant readiness."}
{"instruction": "When did Saul become Paul? Does the name change carry special meaning?", "input": "", "output": "Acts records Saul's name change in Acts 13. Up to verse 2 Luke calls him \"Saul\", the Hebrew form linked to King Saul. After he and Barnabas are set apart for missionary work (Acts 13:1\u20113), Luke begins calling him \"Paul\" (Acts 13:13). The change does not occur at his conversion (Acts 9) but when he launches his Gentile mission. \"Paul\" (Latin Paulus) means \"small\" and would have been familiar to his Roman audience. The new name reflects his mission to the Gentiles and perhaps his humility (1 Corinthians 9:19\u201123); it does not signal a doctrinal shift. Scripture does not suggest mystical significance in the change\u2014rather it shows Paul's desire to adapt his name for the people he would serve."}
{"instruction": "During Jesus' ministry demonic activity was common. Can pastors today cast out demons? Are some illnesses the result of demonic possession? Can good angels ever \"possess\" people?", "input": "", "output": "Casting out demons by Christ's authority. Jesus promised that believers would cast out demons in His name (Mark 16:17). Pastors or believers have no inherent power; they may confront evil spirits only through the authority of the Holy Spirit. Attempting exorcism without divine power is dangerous (Acts 19:13\u201116). Regarding disease, not all illness is demonic. Many diseases result from natural causes, genetics or unhealthy habits; others may be satanic harassment (e.g., Job's afflictions). Discernment is needed: prayer, medical evaluation and spiritual insight. Good angels never possess or control humans against their will; they minister, impress and protect (Hebrews 1:14), but God respects free will. Evil spirits seek to dominate; holy angels influence only with consent. Ellen White notes that angels bring words to our memory and enlighten those seeking truth, but they never override choice. Thus pastors can cast out demons by Christ's power; some illnesses may be demonic harassment; and holy angels never possess people."}
{"instruction": "Is it appropriate for elders, deacons, deaconesses or choir members to sit on the platform during worship services? Is there a scriptural issue with this practice?", "input": "", "output": "There is no biblical prohibition against church officers sitting on the stage. The pulpit is sacred and should be used reverently, but sitting on the platform is not irreverent if those present behave respectfully. Scripture emphasises reverence and order in worship (Habakkuk 2:20; 1 Corinthians 14:40). The real concern is conduct, not seating. Many congregations seat choir members, elders or guest speakers on the platform to facilitate orderly transitions in the service. Children should not treat the platform as a playground. Ellen White cautions that leaders should maintain decorum and respect. Therefore it is acceptable for church officers to sit on the stage provided they do so reverently; the emphasis should remain on honouring God rather than arbitrary seating rules."}
{"instruction": "In the parable of the Tares and Wheat (Matthew 13), can the tares (sinners) be converted into wheat through the Gospel? Can good seed (wheat) become tares?", "input": "", "output": "Conversion is possible before probation closes. The question conflates two different parables in Matthew 13\u2014the parable of the sower (seed falls on different soils) and the parable of the wheat and tares (an enemy sows tares among wheat). Jesus interprets the latter as the righteous and the wicked co\u2011existing until the harvest (Matthew 13:37\u201143). The hosts affirm that before the close of probation sinners can repent and receive a new heart (Ezekiel 36:26\u201127); even persecutors like Saul of Tarsus can become faithful believers. Likewise, believers must abide in Christ lest they fall away (John 15:1\u20116; 1 Corinthians 10:12). After the harvest the verdict is fixed (\"let him that is unjust be unjust still\"\u2014Revelation 22:11). Therefore the Gospel can transform \"tares\" into \"wheat\" before probation closes, and believers must guard against apostasy; after the judgement there is no change."}
{"instruction": "In Luke 21:25\u201126 Jesus speaks of signs in the sun, moon and stars and \"distress of nations.\" Are these signs happening now, or do they refer to a future time?", "input": "", "output": "Historic signs and future distress. Luke 21 parallels Matthew 24 and Mark 13. Jesus outlines events from the destruction of Jerusalem to the Second Coming. Adventists interpret the dark day (May 19 1780) and the falling of the stars (November 13 1833) as fulfilments of the heavenly signs (Matthew 24:29). The \"distress of nations\" in Luke 21:25\u201126 is particularly connected with the period after probation closes\u2014during the seventh plague\u2014when the lost will experience overwhelming terror at Christ's appearing. Ellen White emphasises that this distress is not our current turmoil but the fear of the unrepentant when mercy has ceased. Thus while we see signs of Christ's approach in current events, the intense distress described by Jesus will occur at the end of time. Believers should watch and be ready but avoid speculation or date\u2011setting (Mark 13:32\u201137)."}
{"instruction": "Does the order of the names \"Jesus Christ\" versus \"Christ Jesus\" in Scripture imply doctrinal emphasis? Does one emphasise His humanity or divinity more than the other?", "input": "", "output": "The order of the names does not carry doctrinal weight. Both \"Jesus Christ\" and \"Christ Jesus\" refer to the same Person. \"Jesus\" (Greek form of Hebrew Yeshua) means \"Jehovah saves\" and highlights His mission as Saviour (Matthew 1:21). \"Christ\" (Greek Christos) means \"Anointed One\" and corresponds to the Hebrew Mashiach (Messiah), emphasising His role as anointed King and Priest. The New Testament uses both orders interchangeably (e.g., Acts 4:10; Philippians 1:1) without signalling different aspects of His nature. It is better to focus on the meaning of the titles rather than infer hidden significance from their order. Both expressions refer to the same divine\u2011human Saviour."}
{"instruction": "What will happen to our pets during the time of persecution? Will pets be present on the new earth?", "input": "", "output": "Christ came to save people, not animals. Romans 8:19\u201122 notes that the whole creation groans under the curse of sin and longs for deliverance. God cares for His creatures (Matthew 10:29), yet Scripture and the Spirit of Prophecy emphasise that Christ's mission was to save humankind, not animals. The fate of pets during the end\u2011time is not specifically addressed in the Bible. Ellen White notes that the new earth will be filled with peaceful animals (Isaiah 11:6\u20119) and that God will supply joys far exceeding what we have known. We are not promised the resurrection of individual pets, but we can trust that whatever we lack will be more than compensated in the new earth. Our priority should be to accept Christ's salvation; God's plan for the animals is not central to the Gospel."}
{"instruction": "What did Jesus do during the 18 silent years between age 12 and 30 that are not recorded in Scripture?", "input": "", "output": "The Gospels give little information about Jesus' life between His visit to the temple at age 12 (Luke 2:41\u201151) and His baptism at about 30. However, Luke 2:52 summarises those years: \"Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.\" Ellen White adds that after recognising His mission in the temple He returned to Nazareth and was subject to His parents (Luke 2:51). He learned and practised the trade of a carpenter (Mark 6:3), working diligently and supporting His family. He studied Scripture, communed with God in nature and developed spiritually, mentally, physically and socially. Throughout those years He resisted peer pressure and remained unsullied by sin. The so\u2011called silent years were a time of preparation: humble labour, obedience and personal growth that prepared Him for His public ministry."}
{"instruction": "Is it consistent with the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy to pay retirement benefits (funded by tithe) to former church employees who later enter politics or adopt lifestyles contrary to church doctrine? Do such individuals retain a right to church support?", "input": "", "output": "Retirement benefits are based on previous service, not current tithe. Within the Adventist system, church employees contribute to a retirement fund during their years of service. Historically, church entities placed a portion of a worker's compensation into an investment fund; employees could match contributions. Upon retirement, individuals draw from that fund. These monies represent earnings from past service rather than ongoing tithe. Even if a retiree later engages in politics or violates church standards, the organisation is legally obligated to honour the contract. Failing to do so could jeopardise the church's legal standing. Retirees are no longer receiving tithe salary for ministry; they are drawing from funds set aside earlier. Church discipline may remove credentials and restrict influence, but contractual benefits are distinct. Paying retirement benefits to former employees\u2014even those who diverge from doctrine\u2014does not violate biblical or prophetic principles because the payments derive from past earnings, not active tithe income."}
{"instruction": "Can a woman give a sermon on the Sabbath day? May women lead prayer, read Scripture or preach? How should we understand Paul's statements about women being silent in church?", "input": "", "output": "Speaking versus ecclesiastical authority. Several New Testament passages are often cited to restrict women's participation: 1 Corinthians 14:34\u201135 (\"let your women keep silence\"); 1 Timothy 2:11\u201112 (\"I do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man\"); and 1 Corinthians 11:3\u201110 (headship and head coverings). The hosts explain that these texts address specific issues, not a universal ban on women speaking. 1 Corinthians 14 addresses disorder in Corinth; men and women were calling out questions across the aisles during worship. Paul counsels them to ask questions at home so that services remain reverent. 1 Timothy 2 concerns ecclesiastical authority\u2014Paul forbids women from exercising pastoral or elder authority over men. It does not prohibit women from preaching under God's inspiration. In fact, Scripture recognises women who pray and prophesy in church (1 Corinthians 11:5), and Ellen White and other women regularly preached in Adventist history. The key distinction is between occupying an office of authority (reserved for appointed elders) and sharing God's Word, which both men and women may do. Women may therefore preach, teach and lead in worship as long as they do so under the Word's authority and in harmony with biblical order."}
{"instruction": "When should we interpret a biblical text literally and when symbolically? A friend claims the Sabbath is now only spiritual, citing Matthew 11:28\u201130 and Hebrews 4:9, and argues there can be no literal Sabbath because of time zones. How should we respond?", "input": "", "output": "Scripture is literal unless context demands symbolism. A core hermeneutical principle is that the Bible should be understood literally unless the context clearly indicates a figurative meaning. Prophetic books like Daniel or Revelation use symbols, but historical narratives and moral instructions are generally literal. Matthew 11:28\u201130 invites weary souls to find spiritual rest in Christ, complementing rather than abolishing the literal seventh\u2011day Sabbath. Hebrews 4:9 states that \"there remains a sabbath\u2011keeping\" (sabbatismos) for God's people; it links the rest promised to Israel with the believer's experience but does not negate the weekly Sabbath (cf. Luke 23:56; Acts 16:13). The Sabbath commandment (Exodus 20:8\u201111) is part of the Ten Commandments, written with God's own finger; we do not spiritualise \"You shall not murder\" or \"You shall not steal,\" so we should not spiritualise \"Remember the Sabbath day\". Jesus and the apostles kept the Sabbath and even told believers to pray that their flight not be on the Sabbath (Matthew 24:20), indicating its continuity. Time zones pose no problem because each locality keeps the Sabbath from sunset to sunset (Leviticus 23:32). Jesus offers spiritual rest every day, but this complements rather than replaces the literal 24\u2011hour Sabbath."}
{"instruction": "Is it all right to wash dishes on the Sabbath? How should we apply biblical principles to everyday chores?", "input": "", "output": "Follow the principles, not a rigid list. Scripture does not provide a detailed list of Sabbath do's and don'ts. Instead it offers principles to apply prayerfully. Isaiah 58:13 urges us to turn from \"doing your pleasure\" on God's holy day and to honour the Sabbath. Exodus 20:8\u201111 commands us to cease from our normal work on the seventh day. Ellen White counsels that all necessary preparation\u2014cooking, bathing, polishing shoes and placing clothing in readiness\u2014should be done before sundown Friday. Routine housework, including dishwashing, should be avoided on the Sabbath if possible; however, works of necessity and mercy are appropriate. For example, feeding and caring for the sick or providing food for the needy are permitted acts of mercy. In her diary she recounts that if a family lacks food on the Sabbath, believers should not hesitate to provide it. Each person should prayerfully ask whether a task is necessary for worship or mercy, whether it could have been done beforehand and whether it detracts from spiritual focus. Occasional washing of a few dishes to prevent spoilage may be justified, but ordinary dishwashing that could have been done before Sabbath should be set aside until after sundown. The aim is to keep the Sabbath a delight without slipping into legalism."}
{"instruction": "Is it biblical for women to wear pants? Does Deuteronomy 22:5 forbid women from wearing trousers? How do cultural garments like kilts fit into this discussion?", "input": "", "output": "Maintain gender distinction and modesty. Deuteronomy 22:5 states that a woman shall not wear what pertains to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment. The context forbids cross\u2011dressing for the purpose of deception or immorality. It emphasises maintaining clear gender distinction, not prescribing specific garments for all cultures. Ellen White summarises several principles of Christian dress: clothing should be neat, clean, simple and economical; healthful (not too tight); modest; of good quality and well\u2011fitting; and there should be a clear distinction between men's and women's apparel. In many cultures today pants are designed specifically for women, with different cut and styling; when a woman wears pants made for women, she is not adopting men's attire. Likewise, cultural garments like kilts in Scotland are male clothing; they are not cross\u2011dressing. Men should not wear women's clothing, and women should not wear male\u2011designed garments to confuse gender. Deuteronomy 22:5 is about preventing gender confusion, not forbidding specific fabrics or styles. Christians should dress modestly and honour God, maintaining gender distinction within cultural norms."}
{"instruction": "If Jesus is our example in all things, why should Christians today avoid eating fish? He ate fish after His resurrection (Luke 24), so is it wrong to eat fish now?", "input": "", "output": "Dietary counsel changes with circumstances. In Bible times fish were a common and relatively clean food. Jesus ate fish (Luke 24:42\u201143) and even prepared fish for His disciples (John 21:9\u201113). Eating fish was permitted under the Levitical diet (Leviticus 11:9\u201110). Ellen White and other health reformers counselled against eating flesh foods\u2014including fish\u2014not because it is inherently sinful but because of health concerns. Over centuries pollution has made many water sources unsafe; fish often accumulate toxins such as mercury and industrial chemicals. God's ideal diet in Eden was plant\u2011based (Genesis 1:29). After the Flood meat was permitted as a concession, but the goal is to return to the Edenic diet. Ellen White wrote that God's people should seek the best diet for their time; in a polluted world abstaining from meat, including fish, promotes health and clarity of mind. Eating fish is therefore a health recommendation, not a moral test; salvation does not hinge on diet. Christians should make informed choices based on Scripture, health principles and individual circumstances."}
