The beast rises from the \"bottomless pit\" or abyss (the grave), indicating it received a deadly wound and then resurrects. The number eight in the Bible is the number of resurrection.\n\nThe United States (the sixth head) gives its kingdom to the seventh head (the papacy), enabling it to resurrect to power.

Since Jesus never sinned - including never transgressing health laws - He would not have suffered sickness as a consequence of breaking God's laws.\n\n**Biblical Support:**\n- Luke 2:39-40 states that Jesus' parents \"performed all things according to the law of the Lord\" and \"the child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom and the grace of God\"\n- Our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, and Jesus fully understood the need for a healthy body"}]}

While people cite circumstances like:\n- Mother's life being threatened\n- Incest\n- Rape\n\nThe question becomes: Cannot God prevent the danger? Can't God preserve the mother's life if it's His will?\n\n**Biblical Example:**\nIn Genesis 35:18, Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin. She gave her life for him to be born, showing that even in difficult circumstances, life was valued.\n\n**Personal Testimony:**\nThe pastor shared about a boy named Jeffrey with severe Down syndrome from his congregation. Initially having negative views about such conditions, he learned profound lessons:\n- Jeffrey showed genuine love and emotion\n- He would wait in a tree and clap when the pastor arrived\n- He would sit on the pastor's lap and pet his face\n- He had feelings, emotions, and capacity for love\n- Even children born with conditions from difficult circumstances like incest can teach us about love and humanity\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWe need to believe in the sanctity of life and leave decisions in the hands of God rather than taking things into our own hands.

The context is important - she's discussing God's love for His people and how angels protect them.\n\n**From Early Writings page 39:**\n\"There is perfect order and harmony in the holy city. All the angels that are commissioned to visit the earth hold a golden card, which they present to the angels at the gates of the city as they pass in and out.\"\n\n**Understanding the Golden Card:**\nWhile we cannot give a very detailed answer since Scripture doesn't address this specifically, we can understand it in context of what the Bible teaches about heavenly records:\n\n**Biblical Context of Heavenly Records:**\n- Malachi 3:16 - Books of remembrance\n- Psalm 56:8 - God keeps records of our tears\n- Revelation 20:12 - Books opened in judgment\n- Daniel 7:9-10 - \"The court was seated and the books were opened\"\n\n**Probable Meaning:**\nThe golden card likely represents a record of the angels' missions. When angels leave heaven, they present the card showing their commission. When they return, the card contains the record of their mission - showing how humans accepted or rejected God's interventions.\n\n**Why Records Exist:**\nGod doesn't have memory problems - He knows everything. However, heaven and the universe contain millions of intelligent beings (angels and inhabitants of other worlds) who are watching the great controversy unfold on Earth. The records provide transparency for the entire universe.\n\n**In Daniel 7:10:**\n\"A thousand thousands ministered to Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.\"\n\nThe judgment has many angelic witnesses. God's character is at stake because Satan has brought accusations against Him. The records show all beings that God acts justly.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe golden card represents the perfect order and harmony in the holy city and ensures transparency in how angels carry out their missions on Earth."}]}

The end of it shall be with a flood, and till the end of the war desolations are determined.\"\n\n**Verse 27:** \"Then He shall confirm a covenant with many for one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate...\"\n\n**Key Understanding:**\nThe destruction of Jerusalem is **mentioned** in the prophecy but falls **outside the chronological parameters** of the 70 weeks. Notice:\n- The 70 weeks end in 34 A.D.\n- Jerusalem's destruction occurred in 70 A.D. (36 years later)\n- Verse 26 places this destruction in the **future** (\"who is to come\")\n\n**Why Jerusalem Was Destroyed:**\nThe destruction was a **consequence** of what happened during the 70 weeks - the Jewish nation's rejection of the Messiah.\n\n**Key Words Connecting the Prophecy:**\nTwo words appear in both Daniel 9 and Matthew 24:\n1. **Abomination**\n2. **Desolate**\n\n**Matthew 24:15:** \"Therefore when you see the **'abomination of desolation,'** spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, whoever reads, let him understand.\"\n\n**Luke 21:20:** \"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its **desolation** is near.\"\n\nThe Roman armies were the \"abomination of desolation.\"\n\n**God's Extended Mercy:**\nEven after the 70 weeks ended and the Jewish nation was rejected as a theocracy, God still extended mercy to individuals within the Jewish nation.\n\n**Matthew 23:34-36:**\nJesus said: \"Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth... Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon **this generation**.\"\n\n**Ellen White - Great Controversy pages 27-28:**\n\"For nearly 40 years after the doom of Jerusalem had been pronounced by Christ Himself, the Lord delayed His judgments upon the city and the nation. Wonderful was the long-suffering of God toward the rejecters of His gospel and the murderers of His Son...\n\nThrough the preaching of the apostles and their associates, God would cause light to shine upon them; they would be permitted to see how prophecy had been fulfilled... The children were not condemned for the sins of the parents; but when with knowledge of all the light given to their parents, the children rejected the additional light granted to themselves, they became partakers of the parents' sins and filled up the measure of their iniquity.\"\n\n**Answer Summary:**\nThe destruction of Jerusalem is contemplated in Daniel 9 as an **event** and **consequence** of the rejection of the Messiah during the 70 weeks, but it does not fall within the **chronological parameters** of those 70 weeks.

Now Boaz, whose young women you were with, is he not our relative? In fact, he is winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor. Therefore wash yourself and anoint yourself, put on your best garment and go down to the threshing floor; but do not make yourself known to the man until he has finished eating and drinking. Then it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall notice the place where he lies; and you shall go in,"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This cultural custom sounds awkward to modern readers, but it was perfectly acceptable in that time and culture.\n\n**What Actually Happened:**\n- Boaz finished eating and drinking at the threshing floor\n- He lay down to sleep (as was common for workers in the fields)\n- He covered his feet with a mantle/blanket (to keep warm)\n- Ruth came quietly and uncovered his feet\n- She took part of his mantle and covered herself with it\n- At midnight, Boaz was startled to find a woman at his feet\n\n**The Symbolic Meaning:**\nThis was a **culturally appropriate symbolic request for marriage**. Ruth was asking Boaz to \"take her under his wing\" - to marry her and become her kinsman-redeemer.\n\n**Ruth 3:9:** \"So she answered, 'I am Ruth, your maidservant. Take your maidservant under your wing, for you are a close relative [a redeemer].'\"\n\n**Cultural Background:**\nIn Israel at that time, it was the duty of the close relative (go'el/redeemer) to marry the wife of a deceased relative and raise up descendants for the deceased person.\n\n**Ruth Was Virtuous:**\n**Ruth 3:11:** \"And now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for you all that you request, **for all the people of my town know that you are a virtuous woman**.\"\n\nThe fact that Boaz calls Ruth \"virtuous\" proves she did nothing immoral or inappropriate. A virtuous woman would never do anything to put her reputation or Boaz's reputation at stake.\n\n**Cultural Custom:**\nIt's said that in the East, women going to bed with their lawful husbands would, through modesty and as a token of subjection, go to the bed's foot and gently raise the clothes and creep under them to their place.\n\nServants would also lie at the feet of their masters and take a portion of the master's mantle to cover themselves - this was culturally appropriate.\n\n**Adam Clarke's Commentary:**\n\"Had not Boaz been a person of extraordinary piety, prudence, and continence, this experiment might have been fatal to Ruth... The experiment, however, was dangerous and should in no sense be imitated.\"\n\n**Boaz's Positive Response:**\n**Ruth 3:10:** \"Blessed are you of the LORD, my daughter! For you have shown more kindness at the end than at the beginning, in that you did not go after young men, whether poor or rich.\"\n\nBoaz was apparently older than Ruth. He was pleased that she was following Naomi's godly advice rather than pursuing younger men.\n\n**Important Context:**\nRuth and Boaz became parents of Obed, who was in the lineage of King David, and ultimately in the lineage of the Messiah.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis passage deals with a cultural custom of that day which we don't practice today. Ruth was asking Boaz to marry her in a culturally appropriate way. Both Ruth and Boaz were persons of moral integrity. This text cannot be used to justify any modern immoral behavior. The \"uncovering of feet\" was a symbolic, modest, and culturally accepted way of proposing marriage through the kinsman-redeemer system."}]}

I've heard some pastors discourage the use of drums in the sanctuary - is this biblical? Do drums stir up certain emotions and physical excitement that feeds the carnal mind rather than being Christ-centered?\n\nContext: Follow-up questions include references to Psalm 149:3 (\"Let them praise His name with dancing, making melody to Him with tambourine and lyre\") and Psalm 150:4 (\"Praise Him with tambourine and dance\"), asking what \"dance\" means biblically."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**The Core Principle - It's Not the Instrument, It's How It's Used:**\n\nThe problem is NOT the instrument itself. The problem is the WAY the instrument is used.\n\n**Example:** You can use snare drums with a symphony orchestra perfectly appropriately. However, the way drums are used in many churches today is with consistent syncopation and rhythm that appeals to the lower nature rather than the higher faculties.\n\n**Musical Genres to Avoid in Church:**\n\nThere ARE certain genres of music that should not be used in church:\n- **Jazz** - prepared for New Orleans nightclubs and bars\n- **Reggaeton**\n- **Salsa**\n- **Heavy metal rock**\n- **Rock music in general**\n\nAll of this music was prepared for the world and actually takes our thoughts AWAY from the Lord rather than drawing us closer to Him.\n\n**Biblical Example - Daniel 3:**\n\nAt Nebuchadnezzar's image dedication, music was used to prepare people's senses for pagan worship:\n\n**Daniel 3:7:** \"So at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, and lyre, in symphony with all kinds of music, all the people, nations, and languages fell down and worshiped the gold image...\"\n\n**Key Point:** Some instruments used (flute, horn, harp, lyre) were also used in Hebrew sanctuary worship. BUT Nebuchadnezzar used them in a sensual way intended to numb the senses so people could be led to pagan worship.\n\n**The Trumpet Example:**\n\"From the same trumpet I can play jazz like you're in New Orleans, or I can play 'How Great Thou Art.' One will lead you to move your body from the neck down. The other will move you from the neck up.\"\n\n**Important Principle:**\n- **Good music:** Moves you from the neck UP (appeals to intellect and spirit)\n- **Questionable music:** Moves you from the neck DOWN (appeals to body and emotions only)\n\n**Worship Should Appeal to Intellect, Not Only Emotions:**\n\nPeople today want an emotional religion rather than an intellectual religion where you have to think and work through Bible passages.\n\nSatan used music at the 1900 Indiana camp meeting to make \"of non-effect the Three Angels Messages\" (Ellen White). The music there was tame compared to some modern church music.\n\nWorship should appeal to the intellect and not only to the emotions, because emotions change, but what you learn and settle in your brain endures.\n\n**What About Cultural Styles?**\n\n**The Balance:** If cultural styles follow the principles of good music and good worship music, use them.\n\nExamples:\n- African styles with certain rhythms\n- Andean music from Peru/Bolivia with flutes and string instruments\n- Brazilian music styles\n\n**The test:** Does the cultural style follow Biblical principles of good music?\n\nCulture itself is not bad or good - it's whether what culture practices is in harmony with Biblical principles.\n\n**The Problem of Music Overshadowing the Message:**\n\nExample: Pastor was invited to preach. From 11:00-12:00 was \"praise time.\" At noon, the pastor whispered: \"You have 15 minutes for your sermon.\"\n\n**One hour for praise music, 15 minutes for the sermon?** Which edifies the mind?\n\nAdventist worship services have always centered on the **message**, not the emotions. There should be emotion in worship, but it should not overbear the message that is central to the worship service.\n\n**Principles of Good Church Music (from Ellen White):**\n\n1. **Melody should predominate** over harmony (today harmony is over-emphasized)\n2. **Music is subliminal** - bypasses rational areas and goes to emotions\n3. **Avoid vain repetition**\n4. **Not extremely high volume**\n5. **Follow the rhythm of the body** (the heart doesn't have syncopated beat)\n   - Normal rhythm: strong-soft-strong (like \"Onward Christian Soldiers\")\n   - Syncopation is the opposite\n6. **Don't distort your voice** - sing notes clearly\n7. **Should not focus attention on the artist**\n8. **Should not be used just because it makes us feel good** - use it because it's in harmony with Biblical principles\n\n**What About Dancing?**\n\n**Biblical \"dancing\" is an expression of joy**, not romantic or sensual dancing.\n\n**David's Dancing (2 Samuel 6):**\n- David danced when the ark returned to Jerusalem\n- It was jumping for joy - a specific historical circumstance\n- Ellen White: \"The dance of David is not like the dance that we practice today that leads to licentiousness\"\n- It was just an expression of joy\n- David was not commanded to dance\n- We can't use Bible stories to justify whatever we want\n\n**Psalms 149:3 and 150:4** refer to expressions of joy in festivities, **not worship services**. There is no place where you find dancing within the confines of the sanctuary or temple.\n\n**Contemporary Dance:**\nModern romantic dancing of a man and woman close together cannot be justified by David's example.\n\n**Can We Use Classical Music in Church?**\n\nClassical music that follows principles of good music is fine, BUT:\n- In a **sacred worship service**, use **sacred music**\n- In a **secular environment**, use **good secular music**\n- The Bible says to keep the sacred and secular separate\n\n**Example:** Handel composed both secular music and sacred music (\"Messiah\"). It's best to use sacred in sacred environments and secular in secular environments.\n\n**The Danger of Secular Music Addiction:**\n\nSome argue worship music in church should be solemn and sacred, but outside church you can listen to any secular music.\n\n**The Problem:** If you become accustomed to exciting music that appeals to emotions and makes you move, it becomes like a psychological drug. Then you come to church, someone plays the piano, you're singing a hymn, and you think \"boring\" because your spiritual palette has been conditioned to worldly music.\n\n**Recommended Resource:**\nEllen White compilation book: **\"Music: Its Role, Qualities, and Influence\"**\n- Chapter 7: \"Secular Music\" - subtitle: \"Qualities of Acceptable Secular Music\"\n\n**Quote from that chapter:**\nEllen White enjoyed classical musicians on a ship: \"It did not jar upon the senses as the previous evening, but was soft and really grateful to the senses because it was musical.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a very important question. The principles of good music should guide all our choices, whether in church or outside of church."}]}

To **receive all authority** in heaven and earth\n\n**Matthew 28:18** (just before final ascension 40 days later):\n\"And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, '**All authority HAS BEEN GIVEN to Me** in heaven and on earth.'\"\n\n**Analysis of the Greek:**\n- \"Has been given\" is a **perfect tense** (passive aorist continuing)\n- It means an action that began in the past and continues in the present\n- Jesus received this authority BEFORE this statement\n\n**When did He receive it?** On resurrection morning when He made that quick trip to heaven.\n\n**The Feast of First Fruits:**\n\nThis fulfills the Old Testament symbolism:\n\n**Old Testament Practice:**\nWhen harvest was about to be ripe, a priest would take a sheaf of grain into the holy place and wave it before God as the first fruits.\n\n**New Testament Fulfillment:**\n**1 Corinthians 15:** The Apostle Paul clearly says that \"**Christ has risen, our first fruits**.\"\n\nJesus presented Himself before His Father in harmony with the feast of the first fruits.\n\n**Two Ascensions of Jesus:**\n\n1. **Resurrection Morning (quick trip):**\n   - To hear from the Father that His sacrifice was accepted\n   - To receive all authority in heaven and earth\n   - This is why He said \"Touch Me not\" to Mary\n\n2. **Forty Days Later (final ascension):**\n   - Described in Acts 1\n   - With all the holy angels\n   - All heaven waiting to meet Him\n   - The Father publicly proclaimed to everyone that His sacrifice was accepted (Revelation 5)\n\n**Summary:**\n- Jesus' soul didn't go anywhere at death\n- He was dead for three days\n- On resurrection morning, He made a quick trip to heaven to:\n  - Confirm His sacrifice was accepted\n  - Receive all authority\n- That's why He told Mary not to touch Him yet\n- Later that same day (after returning from heaven), He allowed disciples to touch Him\n- Forty days later came the final, public ascension\n\n**The Key Principle:**\nEverything Jesus did was in concert with His Father.

Is there biblical evidence for us to pay tithe today?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**The Biblical Foundation for Tithing**\n\n**Important Principle:**\nCertain things are not specifically commanded in the New Testament because **they were taken for granted** - they were common practice with no necessity to restate them.\n\n**How Do We Know What Still Applies?**\n\nIf there is **no clear command prohibiting** something, it's still binding.\n\n**Example - Circumcision:**\n- **Clearly abolished** - Paul states: \"Circumcision or uncircumcision avails nothing\" (Galatians 5:6)\n- **Temple sacrifices** - clearly part of the abolished ceremonial system\n\n**But Tithing Has No Such Prohibition**\n\nIn fact, we find **support** for tithing in the New Testament:\n\n**1. JESUS ENDORSED TITHING**\n\n**Matthew 23:23:**\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. **These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone**.\"\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Jesus' purpose: condemning **legalism** (majoring in minors)\n- The problem: Being meticulous about tithing while neglecting justice, mercy, and faith\n- Jesus' command: Do the weightier matters **AND** tithe\n- He was condemning tithing done to **earn God's favor**\n\n**Context of Matthew 23:**\n\n**Matthew 23:2-3:**\n\"The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. Therefore **whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do**, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.\"\n\n**Jesus told His disciples:**\n- What the scribes and Pharisees teach according to Moses' law = **still binding** (including tithing)\n- But don't follow their hypocritical example\n\nJesus believed in tithing as a continuing institution for supporting ministry.\n\n**2. PAUL SUPPORTED TITHING**\n\n**1 Corinthians 9:8-9, 13-14:**\n\"Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say the same also? For it is written in the law of Moses, **'You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.'** Is it oxen God is concerned about?...\n\nDo you not know that those who minister the holy things eat of the things of the temple, and those who serve at the altar partake of the offerings of the altar? **Even so the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should live from the gospel**.\"\n\n**Paul's Argument:**\n- Just as an ox working shouldn't be muzzled (must be allowed to eat)\n- Just as priests/Levites lived from temple offerings\n- **So ministers of the gospel should live from the gospel**\n\nThis sounds like a command: \"**The Lord has commanded**...\"\n\n**1 Timothy 5:17-18:**\n\"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of **double honor**, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. For the Scripture says, **'You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,'** and, **'The laborer is worthy of his wages.'**\"\n\n**\"Double honor\"** in context = **tithe money**\n\nThis is even more explicit than 1 Corinthians 9.\n\n**3. THE BOOK OF HEBREWS**\n\n**Hebrews 7:8:**\n\"Here **mortal men receive tithes**, but there he [Melchizedek] receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.\"\n\n**Context:** Making an argument about Melchizedek being greater than Abraham/Levi.\n\n**Key Point:** \"**By the time Paul wrote Hebrews, men were still receiving tithes**.\"\n\nThe comparison:\n- Old Testament: Tithe returned to Melchizedek\n- Book of Hebrews era: Tithe returned to **Jesus** (represented by Melchizedek)\n\nWhen we tithe, we're not tithing to the church - we're tithing **to the Lord** so the church can carry forward its work.\n\n**4. TITHING PREDATES ISRAEL**\n\n**This is crucial:** Tithing is NOT just \"for the Jews.\"\n\n**Genesis 14 - Abraham and Melchizedek:**\nAbraham gave tithe to Melchizedek **before there were any Jews**.\n\n**The Timeline:**\n- Abraham tithed (Genesis 14)\n- Isaac born later\n- Jacob born later\n- Jacob's name changed to Israel\n- 12 sons of Israel became the Jewish nation\n\n**Tithing existed BEFORE:**\n- Moses\n- The Levitical system\n- The Jewish nation\n- The ceremonial law\n\n**Just Like:**\n- **Sabbath** - existed before Jews (Genesis 2)\n- **Clean/unclean animals** - existed before Jews (Noah took clean and unclean into ark)\n- **Tithing** - existed before Jews (Abraham tithed)\n\nAll three are part of God's original, pre-Israel plan.\n\n**Regarding the \"Cattle and Produce\" Argument:**\n\n**The Principle:** \"The **tenth** of our **increase**\" belongs to God.\n\n**Leviticus Expression:** \"The tenth that passes under the rod\"\n\n**In Ancient Times:**\n- People's wealth = cattle, grain, produce\n- They returned tenth of their actual wealth\n\n**Today:**\n- We earn money (not cattle)\n- We return tenth of our monetary increase\n- **Same principle, different application**\n\n**Why Do People Reject Tithing?**\n\nThe real motivation: **They want to keep all the money for themselves.**\n\nSame with other Biblical requirements:\n- \"We don't have to keep Sabbath - that was for Jews\" = Want all 7 days for themselves\n- \"We don't have to avoid unclean foods - that was for Jews\" = Want to eat whatever pleases the palate\n- \"We don't have to tithe - that was for Jews\" = Want all the money for themselves\n\nThey think prayer blesses what God has cursed, and they want to be excused from any sacrifice.\n\n**What Tithing Really Is:**\n\n**1. A Matter of HONESTY (Not Generosity):**\n- When we tithe, we're not being generous\n- We're being **honest**\n- The 10% belongs to God, not to us\n- NOT tithing = **stealing from God**\n\n**2. Where We Show GENEROSITY:**\n- **Offerings** - this is discretionary\n- Offerings should be given according to God's blessings\n- This is where we demonstrate generosity\n\n**3. An INVESTMENT:**\n- Tithe remunerates pastors\n- Pastors minister to congregation (dedicate babies, baptize, teach Bible studies, do funerals, counsel, visit sick)\n- The tithe returns to us in **services rendered**\n- It's an investment in gospel ministry\n\n**4. A Matter of the HEART:**\n\n**Matthew 6:21:** \"For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.\"\n\n- If your heart is with the Lord, you'll delight in providing for God's work\n- You'll rejoice that you can contribute with tithes and offerings\n- You'll delight in seeing God's work expand and reach more people\n- It's a test of where your affection truly is\n\n**5. A RELATIONSHIP with God:**\n- Tithing is about trusting the Lord\n- It's a symbol of allegiance\n- It's believing in Him in a personal way\n- It demonstrates our relationship of trust\n\n**The Greatest Blessing:**\n\nGod sustains ministers, teachers, and elders who help congregations grow **mentally and spiritually**:\n- Understanding Scripture better\n- Growing in grace\n- Receiving spiritual food\n\nThis return is far greater than the tithe given.\n\n**We Can Never Out-Give God**\n\nAny tithe we return is a mere pittance - it's really just a token compared to all God gives us.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Biblical Evidence for Tithing Today:**\n1. Jesus endorsed it (Matthew 23:23)\n2. Paul commanded it (1 Corinthians 9:14, 1 Timothy 5:17-18)\n3. Hebrews confirms it continues (Hebrews 7:8)\n4. It predates Israel (Genesis 14)\n5. It's a principle, not just a Jewish practice\n6. It supports gospel ministry\n7. It's a matter of honesty, not generosity\n8. It demonstrates our relationship with God\n\nThose who claim tithing doesn't apply today simply want to excuse themselves from Biblical stewardship and sacrifice."}]}

It's a day the Lord:\n- Sanctified (set apart as holy)\n- Made a specific point of connection with His people\n\n**The Primary Emphasis:**\n\nWe are to:\n- **Rest from our labors**\n- **Rest from the cares of the world**\n- **Rest from our obligations**\n- **Delight to do what pleases God**\n\n**Biblical Principle - Isaiah 58:13:**\n\"If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from **doing your pleasure** on My holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy day of the LORD honorable, and shall honor Him, **not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking your own words**...\"\n\n**Key Phrases:**\n- \"Not doing YOUR pleasure\"\n- \"Not doing YOUR own ways\"\n- \"Not finding YOUR own pleasure\"\n- \"Not speaking YOUR own words\"\n\n**Family Time on Sabbath - What's Appropriate?**\n\n**Yes to Family Time WITH SPIRITUAL PURPOSE:**\n- Bible study together\n- Nature walks (nature is God's textbook)\n- Spiritual conversations\n- Activities that connect family to God\n\n**The Test:**\nIs what you're doing **centered only on God**? Are you suspending what you regularly do to **worship God**?\n\n**Specific Scenarios From the Question:**\n\n**1. Going to the Beach Instead of Church:**\n\n**Problems:**\n- **Neglecting assembly** - The Bible says \"do not forsake the assembling of ourselves together\" (Hebrews 10:25)\n- Church attendance is important\n\n**Could a beach visit work?**\n- **Perhaps** - if it's a deserted beach for nature appreciation\n- Walking in the sand, seeing God's creation\n- Peaceful, spiritual reflection\n\n**But NOT if:**\n- There's worldly music playing\n- People are immodestly dressed\n- It's a distraction from God\n- It's entertainment rather than worship\n- It takes focus away from connecting with God\n\n**Example from Pastor's Life:**\n\"When I was four, my parents were missionaries in Colombia. We lived two blocks from the ocean. One favorite activity was going to the beach on Sabbath afternoon **after worship service** to search for shells. Our parents used this to teach us spiritual lessons.\"\n\n**Key difference:**\n- NOT going swimming and horsing around\n- NOT playing ball\n- **YES** to appreciating God's creation with spiritual lessons\n\n**2. Celebrating Quinceañeras (Birthday Parties) on Sabbath:**\n\n**Answer:** **NO** - this is clearly doing \"your own pleasure\" on God's holy day.\n\nThis is a secular celebration that should be held on another day.\n\n**3. Playing Games with Family on Sabbath:**\n\n**The Principle:** Are the games:\n- Connecting your family to God?\n- Teaching spiritual lessons?\n- Centered on worship?\n\n**Or are they:**\n- Just entertainment?\n- Secular activity?\n- \"Your own pleasure\"?\n\nMost games fall into the second category and should be saved for other days.\n\n**4. Churches Organizing Sports and Games on Sabbath:**\n\n**This is problematic** because:\n- It makes Sabbath about entertainment\n- It's doing \"your own ways\"\n- It's not worship-centered\n- It appeals to the physical/recreational rather than spiritual\n\n**The question to ask:** Would these activities naturally lead the family to God, or are they just fun activities we're doing on Sabbath?\n\n**Practical Guidelines:**\n\n**DO:**\n- Attend church in the morning (don't neglect assembly)\n- Spend afternoon in nature WITH spiritual purpose\n- Have family Bible study\n- Discuss spiritual topics\n- Walk and appreciate God's creation\n- Visit the sick\n- Do missionary work\n- Rest from worldly labors\n\n**DON'T:**\n- Skip church for recreational activities\n- Do secular entertainment\n- Play sports/games just for fun\n- Celebrate birthdays/parties\n- Go to crowded, worldly environments\n- Do \"your own pleasure\"\n- Focus on entertainment rather than worship\n\n**The Heart Issue:**\n\n**Be honest with yourself.** It's very easy to rationalize.\n\nAsk yourself:\n- Is what I'm doing **centered only on God**?\n- Am I **suspending** what I regularly do to worship God?\n- Is this **my** will or **God's** will for this day?\n\n**Don't rationalize** by saying \"Well, that's not MY will, that's not MY words...\"\n\nBe **honest and sincere** because God sees the heart.\n\n**Biblical Examples of Acceptable Sabbath Activities:**\n\n- Jesus healed on the Sabbath (doing good)\n- Jesus and disciples walked through grain fields (being in nature)\n- Synagogue attendance (assembly for worship)\n- Teaching and learning (spiritual growth)\n\n**The Balance:**\n\n**God FIRST, then family in the context of God.**\n\nSpending time with family on Sabbath is important, BUT:\n- Within the margins of using time to connect them to the Lord\n- Uplifting them to God\n- Helping them receive a connection with God\n\n**Not:**\n- Entertainment-focused family time\n- Secular activities with prayer added\n- Recreation that happens to fall on Sabbath\n\n**Modern Pressures:**\n\nSome families feel **burdened** and want to spend Sabbath in nature **every week**.\n\n**Response:**\n- Every now and then, if you're burdened: perhaps acceptable\n- But **not all the time** - we need assembly\n- Church fellowship is important\n- Corporate worship matters\n\n**What About Music at the Beach?**\n\nIf you go to a beach with:\n- Worldly music playing\n- Immodestly dressed people\n- Distractions from God\n\n**This doesn't make sense** - it's taking away from the blessing of connecting with God and replacing it with entertainment.\n\n**The Ultimate Test - Isaiah 58:13:**\n\nKeep coming back to this verse:\n- \"Not doing YOUR pleasure\"\n- \"Not finding YOUR own pleasure\"\n- \"Not speaking YOUR own words\"\n- \"Not doing YOUR own ways\"\n\n**Call the Sabbath a DELIGHT** - but a delight in **God**, not in entertainment.\n\n**Final Principle:**\n\nLift secular entertainment and activities to **other days**.\n\nThe Sabbath is:\n- **Sacred** (set apart)\n- **Holy** (belonging to God)\n- **Different** (not like the other six days)\n\nKeep the sacred and secular **separate**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe proper observance of Sabbath:\n1. **Prioritize church attendance** (don't neglect assembly)\n2. **Focus on worship** (connecting with God)\n3. **Include family** in God-centered activities\n4. **Use nature** as God's textbook for spiritual lessons\n5. **Avoid** entertainment, recreation, secular celebrations\n6. **Rest** from worldly labors and cares\n7. **Make it different** from the other six days\n8. **Be honest** with yourself about your motivations\n9. **Test activities** by Isaiah 58:13\n10. **Remember:** It's God's day, not ours\n\nThe Sabbath should be a **delight** - a delight in **God**, not a burden and not mere entertainment."}]}

As the inhabitants of these worlds see the great price that He has paid to ransom men, they are filled with amazement.\"\n\nClearly, there are MORE than just 24 worlds.\n\n**God's Organizational System:**\n\nThe universe has a complex organizational structure with different ranks:\n\n**Colossians 1:16:** \"For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether **thrones or dominions or principalities or powers**.\"\n\nThese represent different ranks in God's universe:\n- Michael the Archangel\n- Cherubim\n- Seraphim\n- Commanding angels\n- Strong angels\n- The highest of angels\n\n**Ellen White - Desire of Ages, page 834:**\nWhen Jesus ascended to heaven, \"With joy, **rulers and principalities and powers** acknowledged the supremacy of the Prince of life.\"\n\nThese ranks existed to welcome Jesus - not humans (only Moses and Elijah were in heaven at that point besides angels).\n\n**Satan Has Copied This:**\n\n**Ephesians 6:12:** \"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age...\"\n\nEllen White states that Satan consults with his council members before taking major steps - he's copied God's governmental system.\n\n**Functions of Elders (On Earth and in Heaven):**\n\nBased on the New Testament church, elders serve as:\n\n1. **Rulers:** \"Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor\" (1 Timothy 5:17)\n\n2. **Representatives:** At the Jerusalem Council (Acts 15), elders from all over the empire came together as representatives\n\n3. **Members of Council:** They deliberate together on important matters\n\n4. **Administrators:** They administer sections of the church\n\nThe elders in heaven function similarly - they are representatives and administrators of different sections of God's universe.\n\n**Also Consider:**\n- **70 elders** also represented Israel and were members of God's council\n- Multiple numerical systems represent God's government\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe 24 elders are representatives of the unfallen worlds who administrate the universe, but the number 24 is SYMBOLIC (like priestly courses), not literal.

Certainly not! On the contrary, **I would not have known sin except through the law**.\"\n\nThe law is NOT sin - it **defines** what sin is.\n\n**2. Romans 7:12 - The Law is Holy:**\n\"Therefore **the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good**.\"\n\nPaul establishes: The law is not sin. To the contrary, the law is:\n- Holy\n- Just\n- Good\n\n**3. Romans 7:14 - The Crux of the Argument:**\n\"For we know that **the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin**.\"\n\n**This is Paul's struggle:**\n- The law is SPIRITUAL\n- I am CARNAL (fleshly)\n- I'm trying to be spiritual\n- The law aids me by creating boundaries for Christian life\n- The law tells me when I'm sinning, slipping, going off track\n\n**Paul's Lament (verses 15-24):**\n\n\"Things I want to do, I don't do. Things I know I shouldn't do, I do do.\"\n\n**Why?** Because the law is spiritual and I am not. I am carnal.\n\n**Romans 7:24 - The Cry:**\n\"O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?\"\n\n**Romans 7:25a - Thanks for Deliverance:**\n\"I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!\"\n\n**Romans 7:25b - The Statement in Question:**\n\"So then, with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.\"\n\n**What Does \"Serve the Law of God with the Mind\" Mean?**\n\n**It refers to his INNERMOST DESIRE to do God's will.**\n\nIn his MIND, he is willing to do God's will:\n\n**Romans 7:19:** \"For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice.\"\n\n**Key Understanding:** With his MIND, he WANTS to serve God. He desires righteousness. But he finds himself under the flesh.\n\n**Can We Serve Two Masters?**\n\n**NO.** Jesus said we cannot serve two masters (Matthew 6:24).\n\nPaul is NOT saying he serves sin and God simultaneously.\n\n**What is He Saying?**\n\nHe's thanking God **in advance** for what he's about to explain in **Romans 8**.\n\nVerse 25 is a **parenthetical statement** - he's thanking God ahead of time because he's about to show the solution.\n\n**The Solution - Romans 8:**\n\n**Romans 8:1:** \"There is therefore **now NO CONDEMNATION** to those who are in Christ Jesus, **who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit**.\"\n\n**This is the basis for everything that follows.**\n\n**Romans 8:5-6:**\n\"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. **For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace**.\"\n\n**Romans 8:7-8:**\n\"Because **the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be**. So then, **those who are in the flesh cannot please God**.\"\n\n**The Tension:** Between flesh and spirit.\n\n**Paul Gives Glimpses of Victory:**\n\nEven in Romans 7, he doesn't leave you in despair. He tells you:\n- There IS victory\n- Victory comes through the law (which is holy, just, and good)\n- When I submit to the law, I am in right standing with God\n\n**Key Principle from Romans 8:1:**\n\nRather than leave you in the hole of doubt, Paul starts the next chapter with **hope**: \"There is now therefore **NO CONDEMNATION**...\"\n\nHe goes back to the struggle, but lets you know **there IS hope if you're in Christ**.\n\n**The Real Victory:**\n\nRomans 8 tells us clearly:\n- There is NO such thing as serving flesh and spirit simultaneously\n- When we have the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us, we can **CRUCIFY the flesh**\n- We can **WALK in the Spirit**\n\n**Important Subtext:**\n\nYou cannot serve two masters. One has to be crucified:\n- One has to be put away\n- One has to be KILLED\n- And KEPT killed\n\n**The Christian Battle:**\n\nYou never get to put your Christian experience on **autopilot**. You don't coast into the kingdom.\n\nYou must **actively fight the battle EVERY DAY** of your life.\n\n**1 John Warning:** \"Those who think they stand, take heed lest they fall.\"\n\n**The Tension We All Face:**\n\n**Should we know we have eternal life?** YES (1 John epistles tell us this)\n\n**Should we think \"once saved, always saved\"?** NO - that's presumption\n\n**The Balance:**\n- Know you're walking with God\n- Know you're in a state of peace with Him\n- Trust God's ability to save you\n- BUT cooperate with Him continually\n\n**The Struggle:**\n\n- **The flesh wants one thing**\n- **The spirit wants another**\n- **We must yield to the Spirit**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPaul is NOT serving God and sin simultaneously. He's saying:\n- In my MIND (innermost being), I desire to serve God\n- But I find the law of sin warring in my members\n- THANKS BE TO GOD through Jesus Christ\n- Victory is found in ROMANS 8 - walking in the Spirit\n\nThe solution is not in the struggle of Romans 7, but in the victory of Romans 8 through the indwelling Holy Spirit."}]}

Go outside. Soon it's dirty again. Hard to keep clean.\n\nChrist had the job of KEEPING clean, and He was successful.\n\n**What IS Sin? - 1 John 3:4**\n\n\"**Sin is the transgression of the law**.\"\n\n**Ellen White - Manuscript 153 / Selected Messages Vol. 1:**\n\"This is **the only definition of sin in the scriptures**: the transgression of the law.\"\n\n**What about James 4:17?**\n\n\"To him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.\"\n\nThis is the SAME thing - it's **sin by omission**. The person knows what they should do but doesn't do it - they're STILL transgressing God's law.\n\n**Key Understanding:**\n\n**SIN = TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW**\n\nTherefore, sin is:\n- A CHOICE\n- A conscious act\n- Participation in rebellion against God's law\n\n**Sinful Nature vs. Being a Sinner:**\n\n**Psalm 51:5:** \"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and **in sin my mother conceived me**.\"\n\n**This means:**\n- I inherit a SINFUL NATURE from my parents\n- But I become a SINNER only when I **consciously participate** in that sinful nature\n\n**Critical Distinction:**\n\n**Do we sin because we ARE sinners, or are we sinners because we SIN?**\n\n**The answer:** We have a sinful nature, but we become SINNERS when we consciously choose to transgress God's law.\n\n**What About Jesus' Fallen Human Nature?**\n\nHaving a fallen human nature does NOT make you a sinner UNLESS you participate in that nature.\n\n**Jesus:**\n- Took a fallen human nature\n- NEVER participated in sin\n- Never had propensities/inclinations to evil that He cultivated\n- Never yielded in ONE SINGLE POINT to temptation\n- Therefore never developed sinful propensities\n\n**Two Greek Words for Sin:**\n\n1. **Anomia** = Lawlessness\n2. **Hamartia** = Missing the mark\n\n**1 John 3:4 in Greek:**\n\"Sin (hamartia) IS lawlessness (anomia)\"\n\nEven \"missing the mark\" is defined as LAWLESSNESS - transgression of the law.\n\n**What Did Christ Redeem Us From?**\n\n**We are NOT born sinners** according to 1 John 3:4's definition (conscious transgressors).\n\n**We ARE born with:**\n- A sinful human nature\n- Sinful propensities\n- Infirmities\n\n**Christ came to redeem us from SIN** (conscious transgression).\n\n**Important Truth:**\n- We will have the fallen human nature UNTIL Jesus comes\n- When Jesus comes, we will be transformed into a glorious body\n- We are NOT expected to be SINNING until Jesus comes\n- As Jesus overcame sin in the flesh, we can ALSO overcome sin in the flesh through Christ's power\n\n**1 John 1:9:**\n\n\"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to:\n1. **FORGIVE us our sins**\n2. **CLEANSE us from all unrighteousness**\"\n\n**Key Point:** God doesn't just forgive perpetually - He also CLEANSES, giving us VICTORY over sin.\n\n**Ellen White Clarification:**\n\n\"Many commit the error of trying to define minutely the fine points of distinction between justification and sanctification. Into the definitions of these two terms they often bring their own ideas and speculations. **Why try to be more minute than inspiration on the vital question of righteousness by faith?**\"\n\n**The Solution:**\n\n- Sin is an **intrusion** into the universe for which no reason can be given\n- You can't blame the devil or anyone else\n- But **praise God, we are not left to it**\n- Christ gives us **power to overcome**\n\n**Romans 8:1:**\n\n\"There is therefore **now NO CONDEMNATION** to those who are in Christ Jesus.\"\n\nThis speaks of God's power in us to overcome sin and sinning.\n\n**Recommended Resource:**\n\nLast Generation Theology Symposium (2020) on the ministry's YouTube channel/website:\n- Presentations on the subject of sin\n- Town halls and panel discussions\n- Different perspectives explored\n- In-depth analysis\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- We are born with a SINFUL NATURE\n- We become SINNERS when we consciously transgress God's law\n- Christ redeems us from SIN (transgression), not just sinful nature\n- Through Christ's power, we can overcome sin\n- Victory is available through the indwelling Holy Spirit"}]}

Can we just say the vows one to the other?\"\n\n**There are many reasons why there needs to be a MARRIAGE CEREMONY:**\n- Both say \"I do\" in **PUBLIC**\n- When one says \"I do,\" the other says \"I do\"\n- The pastor (or official) declares them man and wife\n- **Then they have the privilege of having sexual relations**\n\n**I like looking at it this way:**\n- The covenant/vows give you the **PRIVILEGE** of sex\n- NOT sexual relations as the defining moment\n- The **VOWS are the deal-maker**\n\n**You Do It in Public and Call Upon God to Witness:**\n\nWhen you **call upon God to witness**, that's the **DEAL-MAKER** right then.\n\nWhat happens later (consummation) is something else, but **you made your deal when you called upon God to witness**.\n\n**What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.**\n\n**God Designed It:**\n\nGod:\n- Designed marriage\n- Orchestrated it\n- Gets to give us the parameters and rules we must follow\n\n**The Danger of Emphasizing Consummation:**\n\nSome people have unfortunately taken the concept of consummation to say:\n\n\"My marriage was not really a marriage because we never consummated it.\"\n\n**Example:** People married, but for some reason didn't consummate for a couple of months, then decided to divorce.\n\nThey say: \"We never consummated the marriage, so it doesn't count.\"\n\n**This is a BIG MISTAKE in understanding what marriage is.**\n\n**The Truth:**\n\n**When you are before God declaring to be man and wife, you are TECHNICALLY ALREADY MARRIED - whether you consummate the marriage or not.**\n\n**For whatever reason you don't consummate, you are STILL married before God, and you should NOT separate or divorce from that individual. You have no right to do that.**\n\n**An Analogy - Baptism and the Lord's Supper:**\n\nI don't like the idea of parents allowing children to partake of the Lord's Supper without being baptized.\n\n**The Order:**\n1. **Baptism** is the inauguration ceremony, the covenant ceremony\n2. **As a result**, you have the privilege of partaking of the Lord's Supper\n\nThis isn't identical (it's just an analogy), but it illustrates **the order in which we need to do things**.\n\n**Personal Example:**\n\n\"When I was growing up, I saw that little piece of bread and grape juice coming by, and I wanted it - not necessarily because it pointed to Christ, but because I wanted to eat it! My parents explained the proper order.\"\n\n**The Principle:**\n\nJust as we shouldn't reverse the order of baptism and communion, we shouldn't reverse the priority of vows and consummation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**What marks the beginning of marriage: THE VOWS**\n\n- Marriage is the **PUBLIC COVENANT** where both say \"I do\"\n- This covenant is witnessed by God\n- The covenant gives the **PRIVILEGE** of sexual relations\n- Consummation is a result of marriage, not what creates it\n- You are married before God when you make the covenant\n- What God has joined, let no man separate\n\n**The tradition that marriage isn't \"real\" until consummation is just that - tradition, not biblical teaching.**"}]}

Wasn't he disadvantaging himself knowing that Nero was a cruel man who did not support religion or its advocates?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Why Paul Appealed to Caesar (Nero)**\n\n**The Immediate Context - Acts 25:7-10:**\n\n**Verse 7:** \"When he [Paul] had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about and laid many serious complaints against Paul, **which they could not prove**.\"\n\n**Verse 8:** \"While he answered for himself, '**Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all**.'\"\n\n**Paul's Defense:** He showed he had violated NOTHING - not Jewish law, not the temple, not Caesar's law.\n\n**Verse 9:** \"But Festus, **willing to do the Jews a favor**, answered Paul and said, 'Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me concerning these things?'\"\n\n**The Trap:** Festus was trying to please the Jews by taking Paul to Jerusalem.\n\n**Verse 10:** \"So Paul said, 'I stand at **Caesar's judgment seat**, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.'\"\n\n**Paul's Realization:**\n\nPaul realized that:\n- Festus was trying to please the Jews\n- Taking him to Jerusalem = basically a death sentence\n- The Jews would kill him if he returned to Jerusalem\n- He needed protection\n\n**Ellen White's Explanation - Acts of the Apostles, page 430:**\n\n\"**The apostle knew that he could not look for justice from the people** who by their crimes were bringing down upon themselves the wrath of God. He knew that, **like the prophet Elijah, he would be safer among the heathen than with those who had rejected light from heaven and hardened their hearts against the gospel**. Weary of strife, his active spirit could ill endure the repeated delays and wearing suspense of his trial and imprisonment. He therefore decided to **exercise his privilege as a Roman citizen of appealing to Caesar**.\"\n\n**Another Key Passage - Same Page, Fourth Paragraph:**\n\n\"**Once more, because of hatred born of bigotry and self-righteousness, a servant of God was driven to turn for protection to the heathen.** It was the same hatred that forced the prophet Elijah to flee for succor to the widow of Zarephath, and that forced the heralds of the gospel to turn from the Jews to proclaim the message to the Gentiles. **And this hatred the people of God living in the age have yet to meet.**\"\n\n**Paul's Reasons for Appealing to Nero:**\n\n**1. Protection from Certain Death:**\n- The Jews' hatred would have killed him\n- Better to appeal to a heathen emperor than face Jewish mob justice\n\n**2. Divine Impression:**\n- Paul felt impressed by God to appeal to Caesar\n- This would give him more time to spread the gospel\n- He could continue to speak for truth\n\n**3. Wisdom of God's Plan:**\n\n**Ellen White - Acts of the Apostles, pages 486-487:**\n\n\"From the standpoint of human judgment, Paul's condemnation before such a judge was certain.\"\n\n**Everyone expected:** Nero would condemn Paul to death.\n\n**But:** \"The apostle felt that as long as he was loyal to God, he had nothing to fear. **The One who in the past had been his Protector could shield him still from the malice of the Jews and from the power of Caesar**.\"\n\n**The Outcome - First Trial:**\n\n\"At Paul's examination, the charges against him were **not sustained**, and, **contrary to general expectation**, and with a regard for justice **wholly at variance with his character**, Nero declared the prisoner **guiltless**.\"\n\n**Paul's bonds were removed. He was again a FREE man.**\n\n**It Was WISE to Appeal to Nero:**\n\nPaul was released at his first trial. **It was wise to appeal to Caesar** because God protected His servant.\n\n**4. Nero's Accountability on Judgment Day:**\n\nThough Ellen White doesn't explicitly mention this, there's another reason:\n\n**On Judgment Day:**\n- Nero will be outside the Holy City (Great Controversy, last chapter)\n- His mother will be there too\n- Nero won't be able to say: \"I had no light! I had no knowledge!\"\n\n**God will say to Nero:**\n\n\"Remember when Paul stood before you? Remember when you declared him guiltless? Remember when you saw the holiness of his character? **I tried to reach you. I did everything I could. But YOU extinguished the light.**\"\n\n**Biblical Note:**\n\nThe book of Acts does NOT mention Paul's appearance before Nero.\n\n**However:**\n- Ellen White confirms it\n- Christian historians confirm it\n- It was at the SECOND appearance before Nero that Paul was killed\n- The first time, he was released\n\n**Other Historical Traditions Ellen White Confirms:**\n\n**Example - John and the Cauldron of Boiling Oil:**\n- Nowhere in the Bible\n- Christian tradition reports it\n- Ellen White confirms: John was thrown into boiling oil before Emperor Domitian\n- God did the same with John as with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego\n- This is reliable Christian tradition\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Paul's appeal to Nero was:**\n1. **Wise** - God protected him and he was released\n2. **Necessary** - The Jews would have killed him\n3. **Divinely guided** - God impressed him to do it\n4. **Strategic** - Gave him more time for gospel ministry\n5. **Prophetic** - Gave Nero light he'll face in judgment\n\n**We should never question:**\n- The wisdom of God in how He does things\n- The wisdom of Paul in making the appeal\n- God's protection of His faithful servants\n\n**The key:** \"As long as he was loyal to God, he had nothing to fear.\"\n\nWhen we're loyal to God, He shields us from both human malice and worldly power - even when it seems like we're heading into the lion's den."}]}
