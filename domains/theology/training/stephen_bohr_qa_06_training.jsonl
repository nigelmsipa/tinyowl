{"instruction": "Why will the saved still eat from the Tree of Life if they become immortal at the resurrection?", "input": "", "output": "In the resurrection the righteous \"put on immortality,\" but Scripture teaches that immortality is not an innate human quality; only God possesses self\u2011existence. The hosts explain that humanity's eternal life will always be dependent on God. In Eden, Adam and Eve could live forever only by meeting a condition\u2014obedience and partaking of the Tree of Life. After the resurrection we will receive immortal bodies, yet we will go to the New Jerusalem each month to eat the tree's different fruit. Eating is not a burden but a joy and a perpetual reminder that our life is still a gift from God. God alone \"has immortality,\" so the redeemed will forever depend on Him and will gladly pay homage through this monthly act."}
{"instruction": "What is the difference between Easter, Passover and Communion? Is Easter biblically commanded?", "input": "", "output": "Passover was instituted in Exodus 12 to commemorate Israel's deliverance from Egypt and pointed forward to Christ's sacrifice. At the Last Supper, Jesus instituted Communion in place of Passover; He, the true Paschal Lamb, fulfilled the ceremony. The New Testament therefore does not require Christians to observe the Jewish feast days. Easter, by contrast, has no biblical command; it developed later as a tradition to commemorate the resurrection, with its date calculated by the first full moon after the spring equinox. Remembering Jesus' resurrection is good, but there is no scriptural injunction to celebrate Easter, and it should not be used to justify Sunday sacredness. Adventists thus practice Communion at regular intervals while viewing Easter as a cultural holiday without biblical authority."}
{"instruction": "In Genesis 9:26\u201127 Noah says that Japheth will dwell in \"the tents of Shem.\" Does this refer to literal tents, and how was it fulfilled?", "input": "", "output": "The hosts note that in the context of ancient Hebrew idiom, \"tents\" simply means dwelling places or territories. The prophecy foretold that Japheth's descendants would live among the descendants of Shem. Historically the Indo\u2011European nations (descendants of Japheth) expanded widely, occupying lands previously held by Semitic peoples. European colonization of the Americas, Africa and parts of Asia is cited as a fulfillment of this expansion. Meanwhile, the Shemites conquered spiritually, spreading the gospel. Thus \"tents\" is a metaphor for habitation and influence, not literal canvas shelters."}
{"instruction": "Why did Jesus instruct His followers to pray that their flight not be in winter or on the Sabbath (Matthew 24:20)?", "input": "", "output": "Jesus' warning referred to the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70) and, by extension, end\u2011time crises. When Roman armies approached, believers were to flee immediately without gathering belongings. Winter travel in Palestine was difficult, and fleeing on the Sabbath would hinder rest and worship and might have been more dangerous due to assembled worshippers. The counsel is thus practical, not an admonition to break Sabbath, and it also implies that the Sabbath remained binding decades after the cross. Jesus' words encourage believers to prepare spiritually for coming tribulation, trusting God's guidance whenever flight becomes necessary."}
{"instruction": "What does 1 Peter 3:18\u201120 and 4:6 mean about Christ preaching to \"spirits in prison\"? Did Jesus preach to the dead after His crucifixion?", "input": "", "output": "The hosts caution against misreading this passage and note that many Christians misunderstand it. They point viewers to detailed study notes because the passage requires careful exegesis. They emphasize that the text does not teach that Christ's spirit visited conscious souls in purgatory after His death. Adventist interpretation holds that the \"spirits in prison\" were the people of Noah's day who were spiritually imprisoned by sin; Christ, through Noah's preaching, warned them before the flood. While the program does not provide a full exposition, it underscores that proper study upholds the biblical doctrine of unconscious sleep in death."}
{"instruction": "Has the New Testament abolished the ceremonial law? William Johnson claimed it has not.", "input": "", "output": "Colossians 2:14 speaks of the \"handwriting of requirements that was against us\" being nailed to the cross. The hosts explain that this refers to the ceremonial ordinances (circumcision, feast days, sacrificial rituals) that pointed forward to Christ. These ordinances functioned like an IOU, continually pointing to the future payment of sin by the Messiah; they could never in themselves remove sin. When Jesus died, He fulfilled these ceremonies and cancelled the debt bond for penitent believers. The moral law (Ten Commandments) is distinct and remains binding. The rending of the temple veil at Christ's death symbolized the end of the sacrificial system. Thus the New Testament does not abrogate God's moral law but confirms that the ceremonial system ended in Christ."}
{"instruction": "At the second resurrection will the wicked come up with their old, diseased bodies? Will bedridden people have to lie on the ground while Satan gathers his army?", "input": "", "output": "The panel explains that Ellen White wrote that at the second resurrection \"Satan will strengthen the weak.\" Thus those who were crippled or bedridden will not rise in their infirmity but will be energized by satanic power. The wicked will bear the marks of the curse, yet we are not told the exact condition of their bodies or how long they will live. The hosts caution that speculation is unprofitable: Scripture focuses on the first resurrection and eternal life of the righteous. We should strive to be part of the first resurrection rather than worry about the details of the second."}
{"instruction": "Did Jesus' divine nature die on the cross? If not, how did His resurrection occur?", "input": "", "output": "Scripture teaches that Jesus was both fully God and fully human. At the crucifixion His human nature died, but the divine nature\u2014being eternal\u2014cannot die. Jesus Himself said, \"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up,\" referring to His body. In John 10 He declared He had power to lay down His life and power to take it again. The resurrection involved all three members of the Godhead: the Father commanded, the Holy Spirit acted, and Jesus used His divine power in obedience to the Father. Christ truly \"tasted death for everyone,\" yet He conquered death and now offers immortality to us."}
{"instruction": "What happens to infants who die before they can choose between right and wrong? Are they saved based on their parents' faith?", "input": "", "output": "The hosts cite Jeremiah 31:15\u201117, where God comforts Rachel by promising that her children \"shall come again from the land of the enemy\". They draw parallels to the tenth plague, where the faith of parents who applied blood to their doorposts spared their firstborn. Ellen White wrote that the faith of believing parents covers their little ones, much as faith saved the Hebrew children during the Exodus. However, some children of unbelieving parents may not be saved if parents neglect their duty; conversely, some children of unbelievers are more obedient than those of professed believers. Ultimately, Scripture does not give a definitive answer; we know that faithful parents who lose infants will be reunited with them, and that God is just and will decide each case rightly."}
{"instruction": "Is Christianity merely a tool of white colonizers to keep Africans poor? Can Africans trust the Christian faith?", "input": "", "output": "The panel acknowledges that some self\u2011styled Christians committed grave injustices during colonization, misusing religion to exploit others. However, they stress that biblical Christianity is distinct from the misdeeds of professed believers. Paul argued that the unbelief of some Jews does not nullify God's faithfulness (Romans 3); similarly, the misuse of Christianity by Europeans does not invalidate the gospel. Christianity had roots in Africa long before European colonization\u2014e.g., the Ethiopian official baptized by Philip took the gospel home. God calls people from every nation; thus Africans should trust the Bible and the universal call of Christ, not the flawed behavior of some who bear His name."}
{"instruction": "Why did God strike Uzzah dead when he touched the Ark? Didn't he have good intentions?", "input": "", "output": "Uzzah was a Kohathite responsible for transporting the Ark. God had commanded that the Ark be carried on poles by Levites and never touched directly. Uzzah and his companions placed the Ark on an ox cart contrary to the divine instructions. When the oxen stumbled, Uzzah reached out and grabbed the Ark; despite his intention to steady it, he violated sacred protocol. The hosts note that he also failed to prepare spiritually before handling sacred objects and should not have covered or uncovered the Ark. God's action teaches that sacred things must be treated with utmost reverence and that good intentions do not excuse disobedience."}
{"instruction": "Why didn't God destroy the devil immediately after he rebelled?", "input": "", "output": "Had God annihilated Lucifer instantly, other beings might have concluded that Satan's accusations were correct\u2014that God is arbitrary and dictatorial. By allowing sin to develop, God gave the universe a clear demonstration of the results of Satan's government. The plan of redemption and especially the cross answered all questions about God's justice and love. Though we cannot understand all reasons now and see \"through a glass darkly,\" we can trust God's wisdom. God suffers with His creation during this long conflict but waits until every being is convinced before ending evil."}
{"instruction": "Should Christians participate in sports?", "input": "", "output": "Physical exercise and friendly games can be beneficial, and even church basketball teams have provided recreation and fellowship. The danger comes when sports or watching sports become idols that consume time and attention meant for prayer and Bible study. Anything that we \"spend all [our] time in\" can become a false god. The hosts encourage temperance: enjoy recreation in moderation, avoid excessive competition, and ensure that spiritual life is prioritized. Paul used the metaphor of athletes training to illustrate Christian discipline and temperance."}
{"instruction": "Should Christian children play video games?", "input": "", "output": "Most modern video games contain violence, immorality or occult themes; the hosts argue that Christians should avoid such entertainment. We become like what we behold\u2014what enters our minds through eyes and ears shapes our character. Believers should ask whether they could invite Jesus to participate with them; if not, the game is inappropriate. The same principle applies to films, TV and music: our media choices should build us up spiritually and draw us nearer to Christ."}
{"instruction": "When does the biblical day begin\u2014at sunset or sunrise? How do passages about manna and Jericho relate?", "input": "", "output": "In Genesis 1 the term \"day\" has two senses. It can mean the daylight portion (when God called the light \"day\") and also the entire 24\u2011hour cycle, which begins at evening. The creation account consistently states, \"the evening and the morning were the first day,\" indicating that the day begins at sunset. Passages about gathering manna in the morning or marching around Jericho refer to the daylight hours\u2014the \"restricted sense\" of day\u2014not the beginning of the day. Leviticus 23 explicitly instructs keeping the Sabbath \"from evening to evening,\" and Jesus Himself implied working during the day and ceasing at night. Confusion arises only when one ignores these two distinct uses of \"day\"."}
{"instruction": "Did Adam and Eve know evil before sin? What does \"man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil\" (Genesis 3:22) mean?", "input": "", "output": "Before sin, Adam and Eve knew only good. The serpent's claim that they would gain knowledge of good and evil was a lie. After eating the forbidden fruit they experienced evil firsthand. The Hebrew word \"know\" implies experiential knowledge, not mere intellectual awareness. God had \"known\" evil in the sense that He had witnessed Lucifer's rebellion, but He never committed sin. The hosts emphasize that humans were not intended to experience evil; sin introduced a knowledge that God never desired for His creatures. When sin is eradicated, only good will be known again."}
{"instruction": "How was the biblical canon formed? Did a council simply pick the books?", "input": "", "output": "The canonization of Scripture was a gradual, Spirit\u2011guided process. The Old Testament canon was essentially settled by the time of Christ; debates over books like Esther, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes were resolved by the Council of Jamnia around AD 135. Jesus referred to the three divisions of the Hebrew Bible (law, prophets and writings), indicating a recognized canon. The New Testament canon was largely recognized in Apostolic times; although Martin Luther questioned Hebrews, James, Jude and Revelation, he still translated them, and later study clarified their place. The Apocrypha, written in the inter\u2011testamental period, contain contradictions and were not accepted. Rather than a single council imposing decisions, the canon emerged over centuries as believers recognized books that were harmonious and inspired."}
{"instruction": "Did the Earth exist for millions of years before the creation week? Where did the waters of Genesis 1:2 come from?", "input": "", "output": "Views differ on whether the planet itself pre\u2011existed the creation week. Some believe God created the mass of the Earth earlier and then shaped it during the six days, while others think He made the planet at the start of Day 1. The hosts maintain that the key point is that creation week occurred about six thousand years ago and lasted six literal days. The fourth commandment states that God made \"the heavens and the earth\" in six days, which supports the view that the planet was created at the beginning of the week. Even if the planet existed beforehand but was \"without form and void,\" no life existed until God acted. The question should not be used to support theistic evolution; believing God created in six days affirms the Sabbath and the biblical timeline."}
{"instruction": "Did the Bible borrow the flood story from the Epic of Gilgamesh?", "input": "", "output": "Scholars who deny inspiration argue that the biblical flood narrative borrowed from the earlier Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh. The hosts counter that both stories derive from a common historical event\u2014a global flood. As the story spread among cultures, details were embellished; the Epic of Gilgamesh contains fanciful elements such as gods sending the flood because humans were noisy. The Bible's account is sober and consistent. Similar flood stories in cultures worldwide support the reality of a global deluge. Rather than a borrowed myth, the Bible preserves the original source while other traditions distort it."}
{"instruction": "Can a person be saved while still drinking coffee? Are coffee drinkers going to hell?", "input": "", "output": "The panel stresses that the issue is not a specific habit but obedience to God's revealed will. Coffee drinking (or any habit) is a symptom of a deeper problem\u2014whether we are surrendering to God or justifying sin. A person who excuses their habit while refusing to obey known light may be lost, but one who struggles sincerely and seeks divine help will receive forgiveness and victory. The hosts share stories of believers who wrestled with smoking and, through perseverance and God's power, overcame. Christians should not assume that God is too weak to deliver them; rather, they should trust Christ to give victory over every besetting sin. Salvation depends on continual surrender and obedience, not on achieving perfection by human effort alone."}
