Representing a variety of topics, many\nof them had been published in the church\u2019s periodicals, pamphlets,\nand similar publications. Some, drawn from Mrs. White\u2019s letters\nand manuscripts, had never before been published. The twoSelected\nMessages volumes came to be major source books, supplementing\nthe Testimonies for the Churchand the various books of specialized\ncounsel.\nSelected Messages, Book 3, adds to these helpful resources. Here\nthe reader will find materials that, in many cases, contribute insights\nand perspectives beyond those found in Mrs. White\u2019s previous pub-\nlications. In some cases, such as the workings of inspiration and the\nmanner in which Mrs. White\u2019s books were prepared, increased in-\nterest in these topics has led to the inclusion of a section of pertinent\nstatements, some published for the first time.\nOther important themes treated in this volume include the church,\nthe incarnation of Jesus, education, standards of Christian behav-\nior, health reform, meeting fanaticism, and last-day events. One\nsection documents Mrs. White\u2019s presentation of the principles of\nsalvation before and after the 1888 General Conference session in\nMinneapolis with its emphasis on righteousness by faith, and in-\ncludes her comments about the events of that historic and pivotal\nsession. Another section is devoted to brief collections of statements\non a variety of specific matters, such as lawsuits, the International\nDate Line, renting Adventist churches to other groups, gardening,\nand music. The book closes with three significant appendices, giving\nW. C. White\u2019s knowledgeable comments on the 1911 revision ofThe\nGreat Controversy, on a proper understanding of Mrs. White\u2019s writ-\nings that involve history and chronology, and on how Mrs. White\u2019s\nbooks were prepared, including her use of literary helpers.\nxi\nxii Selected Messages Book 3\nMaking compilations from her writings was one of the specific\ntasks that Mrs. White in her will gave to the Trustees of her estate.\nBeyond material she had already published, she intended that her\nmanuscripts and letters of counsel would provide a widening range\nof service to the church. She wrote in 1905:\n\u201cI am endeavoring by the help of God to write letters that will\nbe a help, not merely to those to whom they are addressed, but to\nmany others who need them.\u201d\u2014Letter 79, 1905.\nThe manuscript for this volume was compiled under the autho-\nrization and by the direction of the Board of Trustees of the Ellen\nG. White Estate, in the offices of the White Estate, by the regularly\nemployed staff. Every effort has been made to include adequate\ncontext with the selections, within the limitations of space.\nIn some cases the selected material mentions the name of the\nperson concerned. In a few instances where no confidence would\nbe betrayed, the name has been retained in the text. In most cases,\nhowever, a letter of the alphabet, beginning with A and running\nconsecutively through the book, has been substituted for the name.\nThe letter chosen bears no relationship to the name it represents.\nThat this volume, presenting important information and counsels\nin many lines, may be a source of blessing and encouragement to\nthe church is the sincere wish of the\nBoard of Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Estate\nSection 1\u2014The Church [10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\nIntroduction[14]\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church was ever close to the heart\nof Ellen G. White. a thousand times and more through her long life,\nHeaven had drawn near to her with messages of encouragement, of\ninstruction, of information, and of reproof and correction. These\nmany visions were given to guide and guard the members of God\u2019s\nSabbathkeeping remnant, both individually and collectively.\n\u201cThe Lord loves his church,\u201d she declared when it was under\nattack (Selected Messages 2:68). Tenderly she wrote, \u201cThe church\nof Christ, enfeebled and defective as it may be, is the only object on\nearth on which He bestows His supreme regard.\u201d\u2014Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 15.\nEllen White loved the church deeply. Her whole life was dedi-\ncated to its welfare and ultimate triumph.\nHow appropriate, then, that this volume of Selected Messages\nshould open with a definition of what the church is, drawn from a\nletter of counsel to an administrator working outside North America.\nThis is followed by admonitions calling for unity as a means of\nstrength, and warning against independent action, which could only\nweaken the church\u2019s efforts to reach and rescue a confused world.\nWhite Trustees.\n14\nChapter 1\u2014What Is the Church? [15]\nChrist\u2019s influence is to be felt in our world through his believing\nchildren. He who is converted is to exert the same kind of an influ-\nence which through God\u2019s instrumentality was made effectual in his\nconversion. All our work in this world is to be done in harmony and\nlove and unity. We are to keep the example of Christ ever before us,\nwalking in his footsteps.\nUnion is strength, and the Lord desires that this truth should be\never revealed in all the members of the body of Christ. All are to be\nunited in love, in meekness, in lowliness of mind. Organized into a\nsociety of believers for the purpose of combining and diffusing their\ninfluence, they are to work as Christ worked. They are ever to show\ncourtesy and respect for one another. Every talent has its place and\nis to be kept under the control of the Holy Spirit.\nA Christian Society Formed for Its Members\u2014The church is\na Christian society formed for the members composing it, that each\nmember may enjoy the assistance of all the graces and talents of the\nother members, and the working of God upon them, according to\ntheir several gifts and abilities. The church is united in the holy bonds\nof fellowship in order that each member may be benefited by the [16]\ninfluence of the other. All are to bind themselves to the covenant of\nlove and harmony. The Christian principles and graces of the whole\nsociety of believers are to gather strength and force in harmonious\naction. Each believer is to be benefited and improved by the refining\nand transforming influence of the varied capabilities of the other\nmembers, that the things lacking in one may be more abundantly\ndisplayed in another. All the members are to draw together, that the\nchurch may become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.\nThe covenant of agreement in church membership is that each\nmember would walk in the footsteps of Christ, that all will take his\nyoke upon them, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart.\nDoing this, \u201cYe shall,\u201d saith the dear Saviour, \u201cfind rest unto your\n15\n16 Selected Messages Book 3\nsouls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:29,\n30).\nThose who wear Christ\u2019s yoke will draw together. They will\ncultivate sympathy and forbearance, and in holy emulation will strive\nto show to others the tender sympathy and love of which they feel\nsuch great need themselves. He who is weak and inexperienced,\nalthough he is weak, may be strengthened by the more hopeful and\nby those of mature experience. Although the least of all, he is a\nstone that must shine in the building. He is a vital member of the\norganized body, united to Christ, the living head, and through Christ\nidentified with all the excellencies of Christ\u2019s character so that the\nSaviour is not ashamed to call him brother.\nUsefulness Increased by Church Ties \u2014Why are believers\nformed into a church? Because by this means Christ would in-\ncrease their usefulness in the world and strengthen their personal\ninfluence for good. In the church there is to be maintained a disci-\npline which guards the rights of all and increases the sense of mutual\ndependence. God never designed that one man\u2019s mind and judgment\nshould be a controlling power. He never designed that one man\nshould rule and plan and devise without the careful and prayerful[17]\nconsideration of the whole body, in order that all may move in a\nsound, thorough, harmonious manner.\nBelievers are to shine as lights in the world. A city set on an hill\ncannot be hid. A church, separate and distinct from the world, is\nin the estimation of heaven the greatest object in all the earth. The\nmembers are pledged to be separate from the world, consecrating\ntheir service to one Master, Jesus Christ. They are to reveal that they\nhave chosen Christ as their leader.... The church is to be as God\ndesigned it should be, a representative of God\u2019s family in another\nworld.\u2014Letter 26, 1900.\nGod Has an Organized Body\nBeware of those who arise with a great burden to denounce the\nchurch. The chosen ones who are standing and breasting the storm\nof opposition from the world, and are uplifting the downtrodden\ncommandments of God to exalt them as holy and honorable, are\nindeed the light of the world....\nWhat Is the Church? 17\nI tell you, my brethren, the Lord has an organized body through\nwhom he will work. There may be more than a score of Judases\namong them, there may be a rash Peter who will under circumstances\nof trial deny his Lord. There may be persons represented by John\nwhom Jesus loved, but he may have a zeal that would destroy men\u2019s\nlives by calling down fire from heaven upon them to revenge an\ninsult to Christ and the truth. But the great Teacher seeks to give\nlessons of instruction to correct these existing evils. He is doing the\nsame today with his church. He is pointing out their dangers. He is\npresenting before them the Laodicean message.\nHe shows them that all selfishness, all pride, all self-exaltation,\nall unbelief and prejudice, which lead to resistance of the truth and\nturn away from the true light, are dangerous, and unless [these\nsins are] repented of, those who cherish these things will be left\nin darkness, as was the Jewish nation. Let every soul now seek to\nanswer the prayer of Christ. Let every soul echo that prayer in mind, [18]\nin petitions, in exhortations, that they all may be one, even as Christ\nis one with the Father, and work to this end.\nIn the place of turning the weapons of warfare within our own\nranks, let them be turned against the enemies of God and of the truth.\nEcho the prayer of Christ with your whole heart: \u201cHoly Father, keep\nthrough Thine own name those whom Thou hast given Me, that they\nmay be one, as we are.\u201d (John 17:11)...\nWhat Christ\u2019s Prayer Envisioned\u2014The prayer of Christ is not\nonly for those who are now his disciples, but for all those who shall\nbelieve on Christ through the words of his disciples, even to the\nend of the world. Jesus was just about to yield up his life to bring\nlife and immortality to light. Christ, amid his sufferings, and being\ndaily rejected of men, looks down the lines two thousand years to\nhis church which would be in existence in the last days, before the\nclose of this earth\u2019s history.\nThe Lord has had a church from that day, through all the changing\nscenes of time to the present period, 1893. The Bible sets before us\na model church. They are to be in unity with each other, and with\nGod. When believers are united to Christ, the living vine, the result\nis that they are one with Christ, full of sympathy and tenderness and\nlove.\n18 Selected Messages Book 3\nThose Who Pronounce Judgment on the Church \u2014When\nanyone is drawing apart from the organized body of God\u2019s com-\nmandmentkeeping people, when he begins to weigh the church in\nhis human scales and begins to pronounce judgment against them,\nthen you may know that God is not leading him. He is on the wrong\ntrack.\nConstantly, men and women are arising who become restless and\nuneasy, who want to set up some new contrivance, to do some won-\nderful thing. Satan watches his opportunity to give them something\nto do in his line. God has given to every man his work.\nTo Restore, Not Tear Down\u2014There are opportunities and priv-[19]\nileges in the church to help those who are ready to die, and to inspire\nthe church with zeal, but not to tear the church to pieces. There are\nplenty of opportunities in the church to walk in Christ\u2019s lines. If the\nheart is full of zeal to press on to a deeper sanctification and holiness,\nthen work in that line in all humbleness and devotedness. The church\nneeds freshness and the inspiration of men who breathe in the very\natmosphere of heaven, to vitalize the church, notwithstanding the\ntares are among the wheat....\nI would caution all believers to learn to maintain a godly jealousy\nover yourselves, lest Satan shall steal your heart away from God and\nyou slip unconsciously into work in Satan\u2019s lines, without perceiving\nthat you have changed leaders, and be found in the treacherous power\nof a tyrant.\nWe are as a church to be wide awake, and to work for the erring\namong us as laborers together with God. We are furnished with\nspiritual weapons, mighty to the pulling down of the fortress of the\nenemy. We are not to hurl the thunderbolts against the church of\nChrist militant, for Satan is doing all he possibly can in this line, and\nyou who claim to be the remnant of the people of God had better not\nbe found helping him, denouncing, accusing, and condemning. Seek\nto restore, not to tear down, discourage, and destroy.\u2014Manuscript\n21, 1893 (Published in The Review and Herald, November 8, 1956.)\nChapter 2\u2014Unity in the Church [20]\nPresent a United Front\nThe testimony of every believer in the truth must be as one. All\nyour little differences, which arouse the combative spirit among\nbrethren, are devices of Satan to divert minds from the great and\nfearful issue before us. The true peace will come among God\u2019s\npeople when through united zeal and earnest prayer the false peace\nthat exists to a large degree is disturbed. Now there is earnest work\nto do. Now is the time to manifest your soldierly qualities; let the\nLord\u2019s people present a united front to the foes of God and truth and\nrighteousness....\nWhen the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the early church, \u201cthe\nmultitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul\u201d\n(Acts 4:32). The Spirit of Christ made them one. This is the fruit of\nabiding in Christ....\nWe have need of divine illumination. Every individual is striving\nto become a center of influence, and until God works for his people,\nthey will not see that subordination to God is the only safety for any\nsoul. His transforming grace upon human hearts will lead to unity\nthat has not yet been realized, for all who are assimilated to Christ\nwill be in harmony with one another. The Holy Spirit will create [21]\nunity.\u2014Letter 25b, 1892.\nUnity Our Creed\nThe prayer of Christ to his Father, contained in the seventeenth\nchapter of John, is to be our church creed. It shows us that our\ndifference and disunion are dishonoring to God. Read the whole\nchapter, verse by verse.\u2014Manuscript 12, 1899.\n19\n20 Selected Messages Book 3\nNot to Draw Apart\nNo advice or sanction is given in the Word of God to those who\nbelieve the third angel\u2019s message to lead them to suppose that they\ncan draw apart. This you may settle with yourselves forever. It is\nthe devising of unsanctified minds that would encourage a state of\ndisunion. The sophistry of men may appear right in their own eyes,\nbut it is not truth and righteousness. \u201cFor he is our peace, who hath\nmade both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition\nbetween us; ...that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by\nthe cross\u201d (Ephesians 2:14-16).\nChrist is the uniting link in the golden chain which binds believ-\ners together in God. There must be no separating in this great testing\ntime. The people of God are, \u201cfellow-citizens with the saints, and\nof the household of God; and are built upon the foundation of the\napostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner\nstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto\nan holy temple in the Lord\u201d (Verses 19-21). The children of God\nconstitute one united whole in Christ, who presents his cross as the\ncenter of attraction. All who believe are one in Him.\nHuman feelings will lead men to take the work into their own\nhands, and the building thus becomes disproportionate. The Lord\ntherefore employs a variety of gifts to make the building symmet-\nrical. Not one feature of the truth is to be hidden or made of little\naccount. God cannot be glorified unless the building, \u201cfitly framed\ntogether groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord.\u201d A great subject[22]\nis here comprehended, and those who understand the truth for this\ntime must take heed how they hear and how they build and educate\nothers to practice.\u2014Manuscript 109, 1899.\nWhat Heaven Ratifies\n\u201cVerily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall\nbe bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall\nbe loosed in heaven\u201d (Matthew 18:18). When every specification\nwhich Christ has given has been carried out in the true, Christian\nspirit, then, and then only, Heaven ratifies the decision of the church,\nUnity in the Church 21\nbecause its members have the mind of Christ, and do as he would\ndo were he upon the earth.\u2014Letter 1c, 1890.\nChapter 3\u2014Independent Action[23]\nDeparting From the Faith\nGod is teaching, leading, and guiding his people, that they may\nteach, lead, and guide others. There will be, among the remnant of\nthese last days, as there were with ancient Israel, those who wish to\nmove independently, who are not willing to submit to the teachings\nof the Spirit of God, and who will not listen to advice or counsel.\nLet such ever bear in mind that God has a church upon the earth, to\nwhich he has delegated power. Men will want to follow their own\nindependent judgment, despising counsel and reproof; but just as\nsurely as they do this they will depart from the faith, and disaster and\nruin of souls will follow. Those who rally now to support and build\nup the truth of God are ranging themselves on one side, standing\nunited in heart, mind, and voice in defense of the truth.\u2014Letter 104,\n1894.\nStrength From Concerted Action\nThe Lord would have all who act a part in his work bear testi-\nmony in their lives to the holy character of the truth. The end is\nnear, and now is the time when Satan will make special efforts to\ndistract the interest and separate it from the all-important subjects\nthat should arrest every mind to concentrated action. [24]\nAn army could do nothing successfully if its different parts did\nnot work in concert. Should each soldier act without reference to\nthe others, the army would soon become disorganized. Instead of\ngathering strength from concentrated action, it would be wasted in\ndesultory, meaningless efforts. Christ prayed that his disciples might\nbe one with Him, as he was one with the Father....\nWhatever good qualities a man may have, he cannot be a good\nsoldier if he acts independently. Good may occasionally be done\nbut often the result is of little value, and often the end shows more\nmischief done than good. Those who act independently make a show\n22\nIndependent Action 23\nof doing something, attract attention, and flash out brightly, and then\nare gone. All must pull in one direction in order to render efficient\nservice to the cause....\nGod requires concerted action of his soldiers, and in order to\nhave this in the church, self-restraint is essential; self-restraint must\nbe exercised.\u2014Letter 11a, 1886.\nCounsel Together\u2014Compare Plans\nIn every effort in every place where the truth is introduced there\nis need of different minds, different gifts, different plans and methods\nof labor being united. All should make it a point to counsel together,\nto pray together. Christ says that, \u201cIf two of you shall agree on earth\nas touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of\nmy Father which is in heaven.\u201d (Matthew 18:19). No one worker has\nall the wisdom that is needed. There should be a comparing of plans,\na counseling together. No one man should think himself sufficient\nto manage an interest in any place without helpers.\nOne man may have tact in one direction, but may be a decided\nfailure upon some essential points. This makes his work imperfect.\nHe needs the tact of another man\u2019s mind and gift to blend with his\nefforts. All should be perfectly harmonious in the work. If they can [25]\nwork with only those who see just as they do and follow just their\nplans, then they will make a failure. The work will be defective\nbecause none of these laborers have learned the lessons in the school\nof Christ that makes them able to present every man perfect in Christ\nJesus. All should be constantly improving. They should lay hold of\nevery opportunity and make the most of every privilege, until they\nbecome better fitted for their great and solemn work.\nBut God has set in the church different gifts. These are all\nprecious in their place, and all are to act a part in the perfecting of\nthe saints.\nThis is God\u2019s order, and men must labor according to his rules\nand arrangements if they would meet with success. God will accept\nonly those efforts that are made willingly and with humble hearts,\nwithout the trait of personal feelings or selfishness.\u2014Letter 66, 1886.\n24 Selected Messages Book 3\nPractice in the Early Days\nWhen the cause was younger, my husband used to counsel with\nmen who had sound judgment. The work was much smaller then\nthan it is now, but he did not feel able to manage it alone. He chose\ncounselors from among those bearing responsibility in all parts of\nthe work. And after counseling together, these men would go back\nto their work feeling a still greater responsibility to carry the work\nforward in right lines, to uplift, to purify, to solidify, so that the cause\nof God might move forward in strength.\u2014Manuscript 43, 1901.\nIndependence a Delusion of Satan\nIt is a delusion of the enemy for anyone to feel that he can\ndisconnect from agencies which God has appointed and work on\nan independent line of his own, in his own supposed wisdom, and\nyet be successful. Although he may flatter himself that he is doing\nGod\u2019s work, he will not prosper in the end. We are one body, and\nevery member is to be united to the body, each person working in[26]\nhis respective capacity.\u2014Letter 104, 1894.\nIt is not a good sign when men will not unite with their brethren,\nbut prefer to act alone, when they will not take in their brethren\nbecause they do not just exactly meet their mind. If men will wear\nthe yoke of Christ, they cannot pull apart. They will wear Christ\u2019s\nyoke, they will draw with Christ.\u2014Manuscript 56, 1898.\nAs we near the final crisis, instead of feeling that there is less\nneed of order and harmony of action, we should be more systematic\nthan heretofore. All our work should be conducted according to\nwell-defined plans.\nI am receiving light from the Lord that there should be wise\ngeneralship at this time more than at any former period of our his-\ntory.\u2014Letter 27a, 1892.\nThorough Organization Essential\nOh, how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to\nget in among this people, and disorganize the work at a time when\nthorough organization is essential, and will be the greatest power to\nkeep out spurious uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the\nIndependent Action 25\nWord of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be\nno breaking down of the system of organization and order that has\nbeen built up by wise, careful labor. License must not be given to\ndisorderly elements that desire to control the work at this time.\nSome have advanced the thought that as we near the close of\ntime, every child of God will act independently of any religious\norganization. But I have been instructed by the Lord that in this\nwork there is no such thing as every man\u2019s being independent. The\nstars of heaven are all under law, each influencing the other to do\nthe will of God, yielding their common obedience to the law that\ncontrols their action. And in order that the Lord\u2019s work may advance,\nhealthfully and solidly, his people must draw together (May 30,\n1909).\u2014Testimonies for the Church 9:257, 258.\n26 Selected Messages Book 3\nSection 2\u2014Principles of Inspiration [27]\nIntroduction[28]\nOur confidence in that which comes to us as messages inspired\nby God is based on our faith in God and his word, as well as upon\nthe convicting work of the Holy Spirit on our hearts. It is also based\nupon the observation of fulfilled and fulfilling prophecy and the\nfruitage of these messages in our own lives and in the lives of others.\nThe influence of the counsels on the development and work of the\nchurch provides additional evidence of their supernatural origin.\nA knowledge of some of the facets of inspiration and revelation\nhelps to sustain such confidence. These may be found in expres-\nsions\u2014often incidental\u2014employed by the inspired writers them-\nselves. These words maintaining our confidence appear in the Bible,\nas well as in the writings of Ellen G. White. The author\u2019s in-\ntroduction to The Great Controversy has contributed much to our\nunderstanding of her inspiration.\nFrom time to time the White Estate has brought out Ellen White\nstatements from her published as well as from her unpublished writ-\nings relating to the question of revelation and inspiration. These of-\nten-used statements, together with material heretofore unpublished,\nare now brought together in this section entitled \u201cprinciples of inspi-\nration.\u201d\nAs in the case of the Bible writers, Ellen White makes only\nincidental reference to her visions. She explains only briefly how\nthe light came to her, and how the messages were delivered. These\nincidental references, appearing in different sources, and often con-\nsisting of only a few lines, are now for the first time brought together\nin this volume.\nWhite Trustees.\n28\nChapter 4\u2014The Primacy of the Word [29]\nRelation of E. G. White Writings to the Bible Recognized in\nFirst Book\u2014I recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as\nthe rule of your faith and practice. By that Word we are to be judged.\nGod has, in that Word, promised to give visions in the \u201clast days\u201d;\nnot for a new rule of faith, but for the comfort of his people, and to\ncorrect those who err from Bible truth. Thus God dealt with Peter\nwhen he was about to send him to preach to the Gentiles.\u2014A Sketch\nof the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, 64 (1851).\n(Reprinted in Early Writings, 78.)\nNot to Take the Place of the Word\u2014The Lord desires you to\nstudy your Bibles. He has not given any additional light to take the\nplace of his Word. This light is to bring confused minds to his Word,\nwhich, if eaten and digested, is as the lifeblood of the soul. Then\ngood works will be seen as light shining in darkness.\u2014Letter 130,\n1901.\nGet Proofs From the Bible \u2014In public labor do not make\nprominent, and quote that which Sister White has written, as au-\nthority to sustain your positions. To do this will not increase faith\nin the testimonies. Bring your evidences, clear and plain, from the\nWord of God. A \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is the strongest testimony [30]\nyou can possibly present to the people. Let none be educated to\nlook to Sister White, but to the mighty God, who gives instruction\nto Sister White.\u2014Letter 11, 1894.\nBible Principles First, Then the Testimonies \u2014It is my first\nduty to present Bible principles. Then, unless there is a decided,\nconscientious reform made by those whose cases have been pre-\nsented before me, I must appeal to them personally.\u2014Letter 69,\n1896.\nE. G. White Work Not Unlike That of Bible Prophets \u2014In\nancient times God spoke to men by the mouth of prophets and\napostles. In these days he speaks to them by the testimonies of\nhis Spirit. There was never a time when God instructed his people\n29\n30 Selected Messages Book 3\nmore earnestly than he instructs them now concerning his will and\nthe course that he would have them pursue.\u2014Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:661.\nScripture and Spirit of Prophecy Have Same Author \u2014The\nHoly Ghost is the author of the Scriptures and of the Spirit of\nProphecy. These are not to be twisted and turned to mean what\nman may want them to mean, to carry out man\u2019s ideas and senti-\nments, to carry forward man\u2019s schemes at all hazards.\u2014Letter 92,\n1900.\nEllen White Calls Her Writings a Lesser Light\u2014Little heed\nis given to the Bible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men\nand women to the greater light.\u2014The Review and Herald, January\n20, 1903 (Quoted in Colporteur Ministry, 125.)\nTested by the Bible\u2014The Spirit was not given\u2014nor can it ever\nbe bestowed\u2014to supersede the Bible; for the Scriptures explicitly\nstate that the Word of God is the standard by which all teaching and\nexperience must be tested.... Isaiah declares, \u201cTo the law and to the\ntestimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because\nthere is no light in them\u201d (Isaiah 8:20).\u2014 The Great Controversy,\nIntroduction, p. vii.\nNot for the Purpose of Giving New Light \u2014Brother J would\nconfuse the mind by seeking to make it appear that the light God[31]\nhas given through the Testimonies is an addition to the Word of God,\nbut in this he presents the matter in a false light. God has seen fit\nin this manner to bring the minds of his people to his Word, to give\nthem a clearer understanding of it.\nThe Word of God is sufficient to enlighten the most beclouded\nmind, and may be understood by those who have any desire to un-\nderstand it. But notwithstanding all this, some who profess to make\nthe Word of God their study are found living in direct opposition\nto its plainest teachings. Then, to leave men and women without\nexcuse, God gives plain and pointed testimonies, bringing them back\nto the Word that they have neglected to follow.\nThe Word of God abounds in general principles for the formation\nof correct habits of living, and the testimonies, general and personal,\nhave been calculated to call their attention more especially to these\nprinciples.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 5:663, 664.\nPrimacy of the Word 31\nTestimonies to Bring Plain Lessons From the Word\u2014In the\nScriptures God has set forth practical lessons to govern the life and\nconduct of all; but though He has given minute particulars in regard\nto our character, conversation, and conduct, yet in a large measure,\nHis lessons are disregarded and ignored. Besides the instruction in\nHis Word, the Lord has given special testimonies to His people, not\nas a new revelation, but that He may set before us the plain lessons\nof His Word, that errors may be corrected, that the right way may\nbe pointed out, that every soul may be without excuse.\u2014Letter 63,\n1893 (See Testimonies for the Church 5:665.)\nEllen White Enabled to Clearly Define Truth and Error \u2014\nAt that time [after the 1844 disappointment] one error after another\npressed in upon us; ministers and doctors brought in new doctrines.\nWe would search the Scriptures with much prayer, and the Holy\nSpirit would bring the truth to our minds. Sometimes whole nights\nwould be devoted to searching the Scriptures and earnestly asking\nGod for guidance. Companies of devoted men and women assembled [32]\nfor this purpose. The power of God would come upon me, and I was\nenabled clearly to define what is truth and what is error.\nAs the points of our faith were thus established, our feet were\nplaced upon a solid foundation. We accepted the truth point by\npoint, under the demonstration of the Holy Spirit. I would be taken\noff in vision, and explanations would be given me. I was given\nillustrations of heavenly things, and of the sanctuary, so that we\nwere placed where light was shining on us in clear, distinct rays.\u2014\nGospel Workers, 302.\nTo Correct Error and Specify Truth\u2014I have much written in\nthe diary [While Mrs. White kept from time to time a daily diary of\nher experience, yet this is not what she referred to primarily in using\nthe term \u201cdiary.\u201d Her writing was often done in ruled blank books,\nmore than a score of which are now in the White Estate Vault, and\nmany of the manuscripts that appear in the file are found to have\nbeen written first in these books. Some manuscripts on file bear\nthe general heading \u201cdiary,\u201d used in this particular sense. It will\nbe remembered that this term is used by her in the Testimonies in\nreferring to her writings in manuscript form. (See Testimonies for\nthe Church 8, 206, where she says, \u201cIn my diary I find the following\nwritten one year ago,\u201d and it is plain from what follows that she is\n32 Selected Messages Book 3\nreferring to testimony matter.)] I have kept in all my journeys that\nshould come before the people if essential, even if I did not write\nanother line. I want that which is deemed worthy to appear, for the\nLord has given me much light that I want the people to have; for\nthere is instruction that the Lord has given me for His people. It\nis light that they should have, line upon line, precept upon precept,\nhere a little and there a little. This is now to come before the people,\nbecause it has been given to correct specious errors and to specify\nwhat is truth. The Lord has revealed many things pointing out the\ntruth, thus saying, \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d\u2014Letter 127,\n1910.\nTestimonies Never Contradict the Bible\u2014The Bible must be\nyour counselor. Study it and the testimonies God has given; for they\nnever contradict his Word.\u2014Letter 106, 1907.\nIf the Testimonies speak not according to the word of God, reject\nthem. Christ and Belial cannot be united.\u2014Testimonies for the[33]\nChurch 5:691.\nOn Quoting Sister White\u2014How can the Lord bless those who\nmanifest a spirit of \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d a spirit which leads them to walk\ncontrary to the light which the Lord has given them? But I do not\nask you to take my words. Lay Sister White to one side. Do not\nquote my words again as long as you live until you can obey the\nBible. [Ellen White was meeting the leaders of the church as a\ngroup for the first time in ten years. Situations in both the General\nConference and in our Battle Creek-based institutions had in many\ncases reached a low ebb. Testimonies calling for a return to Bible\nprinciples had been received, theoretically, but no real improvement\nhad taken place.\nMost delegates coming to the General Conference session, which\nwould open the next morning, sensed that there must be changes.\nEllen White would in the opening meeting rebuke institutional lead-\ners and call for a reorganization of the General Conference. It was\nher burden that the changes that needed to be made would be based\non Bible principles and not just on the word of Ellen White. In this\naddress she declared:\n\u201cGod has told me that my testimony must be borne to this Con-\nference, and that I must not try to make men believe it. My work is\nPrimacy of the Word 33\nto leave the truth with the people, and those who appreciate the light\nfrom heaven will accept the truth.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 43, 1901.\nCounsel would come through her as the messenger of the Lord\nand this counsel should be heeded, but work in depth must be done,\nwork based on the principles set forth in God\u2019s Word.\u2014Compilers.]\nWhen you make the Bible your food, your meat, and your drink,\nwhen you make its principles the elements of your character, you will\nknow better how to receive counsel from God. I exalt the precious\nWord before you today. Do not repeat what I have said, saying,\n\u201cSister White said this,\u201d and \u201cSister White said that.\u201d Find out what\nthe Lord God of Israel says, and then do what He commands.\u2014\nManuscript 43, 1901. (From an address to church leaders the night\nbefore the opening of the General Conference session of 1901.)\nChapter 5\u2014Experiences in Receiving the Visions[34]\nFirst Vision\u2014While I was praying at the family altar, the Holy\nGhost fell upon me.\u2014Early Writings, 14.\nFive of us, all women, were kneeling quietly at the family altar.\nWhile we were praying, the power of God came upon me as I had\nnever felt it before. I seemed to be surrounded with light, and to be\nrising higher and higher from the earth. At this time I had a view of\nthe experience of the Advent believers, the coming of Christ, and\nthe reward to be given to the faithful.\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n5:654, 655.\nThe Experience Recounted\u2014When the gleams of the glory of\nGod came to me first, they thought that I was dead, and there they\nwatched and cried and prayed so long, but to me it was heaven, it\nwas life, and then the world was spread out before me and I saw\ndarkness like the pall of death.\nWhat did it mean? I could see no light. Then I saw a little\nglimmer of light and then another, and these lights increased and\ngrew brighter, and multiplied and grew stronger and stronger till\nthey were the light of the world. These were the believers in Jesus\nChrist....\nI never thought that I should come to the world again. When my[35]\nbreath came again to my body, I could not hear anything. Everything\nwas dark. The light and glory that my eyes had rested upon had\neclipsed the light and thus it was for many hours. Then gradually I\nbegan to recognize the light, and I asked where I was.\n\u201cYou are right here in my house,\u201d said the owner of the house.\n\u201cWhat, here? I here? Do you not know about it?\u201d Then it\nall came back to me. Is this to be my home? Have I come here\nagain? Oh, the weight and the burden which came upon my soul.\u2014\nManuscript 16, 1894.\nEntirely Lost to Earthly Things \u2014When the Lord sees fit to\ngive a vision, I am taken into the presence of Jesus and angels,\nand am entirely lost to earthly things. [This accounts for the fact\n34\nExperiences in Receiving the Visions 35\nthat Ellen White rarely speaks of the physical phenomenon that\naccompanied many of the visions. She herself had to depend on the\ntestimony of eyewitnesses for a knowledge of these manifestations\nas she did in 1906 when she referred to evidences of her call and\nwork. See the item closing this chapter.] I can see no farther than the\nangel directs me. My attention is often directed to scenes transpiring\nupon earth.\nAt times I am carried far ahead into the future and shown what is\nto take place. Then again I am shown things as they have occurred\nin the past.\u2014Spiritual Gifts 2:292 (1860).\nAt Times Visions Received While Conscious\u2014Friday, March\n20, I arose early, about half past three o\u2019clock in the morning. While\nwriting upon the fifteenth chapter of John suddenly a wonderful\npeace came upon me. The whole room seemed to be filled with the\natmosphere of heaven. A holy, sacred presence seemed to be in my\nroom. I laid down my pen and was in a waiting attitude to see what\nthe Spirit would say unto me. I saw no person. I heard no audible\nvoice, but a heavenly watcher seemed close beside me; I felt that I\nwas in the presence of Jesus.\nThe sweet peace and light which seemed to be in my room it\nis impossible for me to explain or describe. A sacred, holy atmo- [36]\nsphere surrounded me, and there were presented to my mind and\nunderstanding matters of intense interest and importance. A line of\naction was laid out before me as if the unseen presence was speaking\nwith me. The matter I had been writing upon seemed to be lost to\nmy mind and another matter distinctly opened before me. A great\nawe seemed to be upon me as matters were imprinted upon my\nmind.\u2014Manuscript 12c, 1896.\nAnother Vision While Writing\u2014I arose early Thursday morn-\ning, about two o\u2019clock, and was writing busily upon the True Vine,\nwhen I felt a presence in my room, as I have many times before,\nand I lost all recollection of what I was about. I seemed to be in\nthe presence of Jesus. He was communicating to me that in which\nI was to be instructed. Everything was so plain that I could not\nmisunderstand.\nI was to help one whom I thought I should never be called upon\nto be troubled with again. I could not understand what it meant,\nbut at once decided not to try to reason about this, but follow the\n36 Selected Messages Book 3\ndirections. Not an audible word was spoken to my ear, but to my\nmind. I said, \u201cLord, I will do as Thou hast commanded.\u201d\u2014Letter\n36, 1896.\nWonderful Representation While Writing and Speaking \u2014\nNot only when I am standing before large congregations is special\nhelp bestowed upon me; but when I am using my pen, wonderful\nrepresentations are given me of past, present, and future.\u2014Letter\n86, 1906.\nEllen White Could Not Control the Visions\u2014It is utterly false\nthat I have ever intimated I could have a vision when I pleased. There\nis not a shade of truth in this. I have never said I could throw myself\ninto visions when I pleased, for this is simply impossible. I have felt\nfor years that if I could have my choice and please God as well, I\nwould rather die than have a vision, for every vision places me under\ngreat responsibility to bear testimonies of reproof and of warning,\nwhich has ever been against my feelings, causing me affliction of[37]\nsoul that is inexpressible. Never have I coveted my position, and yet\nI dare not resist the Spirit of God and seek an easier position.\nThe Spirit of God has come upon me at different times, in differ-\nent places, and under various circumstances. [Elder J. N. Loughbor-\nough reports that the last vision accompanied by physical phenom-\nena was on the campground at Portland, Oregon, in 1884. He was\npresent and he made mention of this in a talk he gave on January 20,\n1893, on \u201cthe study of the Testimonies,\u201d at the General Conference\nsession, held in Battle Creek. See The General Conference Bulletin,\n1893, 19, 20.\u2014Compilers.] My husband has had no control of these\nmanifestations of the Spirit of God. Many times he has been far\naway when I have had visions.\u2014Letter 2, 1874.\nDared Not Doubt\u2014In the confusion I was sometimes tempted\nto doubt my own experience. While at family prayers one morning,\nthe power of God began to rest upon me, and the thought rushed\ninto my mind that it was mesmerism, and I resisted it. Immediately\nI was struck dumb.... After that I dared not doubt or for a moment\nresist the power of God, however others might think of me.\u2014Early\nWritings, 22, 23.\nEllen White Recounts Evidences of Her Call and Work \u2014\nThere is in our world a spirit of belief and also a spirit of unbelief.\nIn the latter days some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to\nExperiences in Receiving the Visions 37\nseducing spirits and doctrines of devils. We expect that those who\nrefuse to harmonize with Christ will develop into a warring element;\nbut we should not think that this will do us harm. We must remember\nthat they that are for us are more than they that can be against us.\nThis is my hope and strength and power. I believe in God. I know\nin whom I believe. I believe the messages that God has given to his\nremnant church. From childhood I have had many, many experiences\nthat have strengthened my faith in the work that God has given me\nto do.\nEnabled to Write\u2014Early in my public labors I was bidden by\nthe Lord, \u201cWrite, write the things that are revealed to you.\u201d At the\ntime this message came to me, I could not hold my hand steady. My [38]\nphysical condition made it impossible for me to write. But again\ncame the word, \u201cWrite the things that are revealed to you.\u201d I obeyed;\nand as the result it was not long before I could write page after page\nwith comparative ease. Who told me what to write? Who steadied\nmy right hand, and made it possible for me to use a pen? It was the\nLord.\nWhen we come into right relation with Him, and give ourselves\nwholly to Him, we shall see the miracle-working power of God in\nword and deed.\nThe Visions Confirmed Conclusions From Bible Study \u2014In\nthe early days of the message, when our numbers were few, we\nstudied diligently to understand the meaning of many Scriptures.\nAt times it seemed as if no explanation could be given. My mind\nseemed to be locked to an understanding of the Word; but when our\nbrethren who had assembled for study came to a point where they\ncould go no farther, and had recourse to earnest prayer, the Spirit of\nGod would rest upon me, and I would be taken off in vision, and be\ninstructed in regard to the relation of Scripture to Scripture. These\nexperiences were repeated over and over again. Thus many truths of\nthe third angel\u2019s message were established, point by point.\nThink you that my faith in this message will ever waver? Think\nyou that I can remain silent, when I see an effort being made to\nsweep away the foundation pillars of our faith? I am as thoroughly\nestablished in these truths as it is possible for a person to be. I\ncan never forget the experience I have passed through. God has\nconfirmed my belief by many evidences of his power.\n38 Selected Messages Book 3\nThe light that I have received, I have written out, and much of it\nis now shining forth from the printed page. There is, throughout my\nprinted works, a harmony with my present teaching.\nWhile in Vision She Did Not Breathe\u2014Some of the instruction\nfound in these pages was given under circumstances so remarkable\nas to evidence the wonder-working power of God in behalf of his\ntruth. Sometimes while I was in vision, my friends would approach[39]\nme, and exclaim, \u201cWhy, she does not breathe!\u201d Placing a mirror\nbefore my lips, they found that no moisture gathered on the glass.\nIt was while there was no sign of any breathing that I kept talking\nof the things that were being presented before me. These messages\nwere thus given to substantiate the faith of all, that in these last days\nwe might have confidence in the Spirit of Prophecy.\nVoice Miraculously Preserved\u2014I thank God that he has pre-\nserved my voice, which in my early youth physicians and friends\ndeclared would be silent within three months. The God of heaven\nsaw that I needed to pass through a trying experience in order to be\nprepared for the work he had for me to do.\nFor the past half century my faith in the ultimate triumph of the\nthird angel\u2019s message and everything connected with it, has been\nsubstantiated by the wonderful experiences through which I have\npassed. This is why I am anxious to have my books published and\ncirculated in many languages. I know that the light contained in\nthese books is the light of heaven.\nStudy the Instruction\u2014I ask you to study the instruction that is\nwritten in these books. To John, the aged apostle, came the message,\n\u201cWrite the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are,\nand the things which shall be hereafter.\u201d The Lord has bidden me\nwrite that which had been revealed to me. This I have done, and it is\nnow in printed form....\nAmid the error that is overspreading the whole earth, let us strive\nto stand firm on the platform of eternal truth. Let us put on the whole\narmor of God; for we are told that in this time Satan himself will\nwork miracles before the people; and as we see these things, we\nmust be prepared to withstand their deceptive influence. Whatever\nis presented by the enemy as truth, ought not to influence us; for we\nshould be under the instruction of the great Author of all truth.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, June 14, 1906.\nChapter 6\u2014Glimpses of How the Light Came to [40]\nEllen White\nIn the First Vision\u2014Seemingly Present, Participating in\nEvents\u2014While I was praying at the family altar, the Holy Ghost\nfell upon me, and I seemed to be rising higher and higher, far above\nthe dark world. I turned to look for the Advent people in the world,\nbut could not find them, when a voice said to me, \u201cLook again, and\nlook a little higher.\u201d At this I raised my eyes, and saw a straight\nand narrow path, cast up high above the world. On this path the\nAdventist people were traveling to the city, which was at the farther\nend of the path.\u2014Early Writings, 14.\nBroad Panoramic Views \u2014Through the illumination of the\nHoly Spirit, the scenes of the long-continued conflict between good\nand evil have been opened to the writer of these pages. From time to\ntime I have been permitted to behold the working, in different ages,\nof the great controversy between Christ, the Prince of Life, the Au-\nthor of our salvation, and Satan, the prince of evil, the author of sin,\nthe first transgressor of God\u2019s holy law.\u2014The Great Controversy,\nIntroduction, pp. x, xi.\nAn Angel Explains the Significance \u2014While at Loma Linda,\nCalifornia, April 16, 1906, there passed before me a most wonderful [41]\nrepresentation. During a vision of the night, I stood on an emi-\nnence, from which I could see houses shaken like a reed in the wind.\nBuildings, great and small, were falling to the ground. Pleasure\nresorts, theaters, hotels, and the homes of the wealthy were shaken\nand shattered. Many lives were blotted out of existence, and the air\nwas filled with the shrieks of the injured and the terrified.... The\nawfulness of the scenes that passed before me I cannot find words\nto describe. It seemed that the forbearance of God was exhausted,\nand that the judgment day had come.\nTerrible as was the representation that passed before me, that\nwhich impressed itself most vividly upon my mind was the instruc-\ntion given in connection with it. The angel that stood by my side\n39\n40 Selected Messages Book 3\ndeclared that God\u2019s supreme rulership and the sacredness of his law\nmust be revealed to those who persistently refuse to render obedi-\nence to the King of Kings. Those who choose to remain disloyal\nmust be visited in mercy with judgments, in order that, if possi-\nble, they may be aroused to a realization of the sinfulness of their\ncourse.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 9:92, 93.\nA Vivid View Relating to a Family \u2014The angel of God said,\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d I seemed to be in a room in a rude building, and there\nwere several young men playing cards. They seemed to be very\nintent upon the amusement in which they were engaged and were so\nengrossed that they did not seem to notice that anyone had entered\nthe room. There were young girls present observing the players, and\nwords were spoken not of the most refined order. There was a spirit\nand influence that were sensibly felt in that room that was not of a\ncharacter calculated to purify and uplift the mind and ennoble the\ncharacter....\nI inquired, \u201cWho are these and what does this scene represent?\u201d\nThe word was spoken, \u201cWait\u201d....\nI had another representation. There was the imbibing of the[42]\nliquid poison, and the words and actions under its influence were\nanything but favorable for serious thoughts, clear perception in busi-\nness lines, pure morals, and the uplifting of the participants....\nI asked again, \u201cWho are these?\u201d\nThe answer came, \u201cA portion of the family where you are visit-\ning. The adversary of souls, the great enemy of God and man, the\nhead of principalities and powers, and the ruler of the darkness of\nthis world is presiding here tonight. Satan and his angels are leading\non with his temptations these poor souls to their own ruin.\u2014Letter\n1, 1893.\nAs If the Whole Thing Were Transacting\u2014Now I have light,\nmostly in the night season, just as if the whole thing were transacting,\nand I viewing it, and as [if] I am listening to the conversation. I am\nmoved to get up and meet it.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1907.\nSymbolic Representations\u2014You were represented to me as a\ngeneral, mounted, on a horse, and carrying a banner. One came and\ntook out of your hand the banner bearing the words, \u201cThe command-\nments of God and the faith of Jesus,\u201d and it was trampled in the dust.\nGlimpses of How the Light Came to Ellen White 41\nI saw you surrounded by men who were linking you up with the\nworld.\u2014Letter 239, 1903.\nSome of the work that has been done [for outcasts] is represented\nas being like men rolling large stones up a hill with great effort.\nWhen nearly at the top of the hill, the stones rolled again to the\nbottom. The men only succeeded in taking a few to the top. In the\nwork done for the degraded\u2014what effort it has taken to reach them,\nwhat expense, and then to lead them to stand against appetite and\nbase passions!\u2014Letter 232, 1899.\nEnabled to Comprehend Symbolic Visions \u2014My mind and\nperceptions are still clear. That which the Lord presents to me in\nfigure, he enables me to understand.\u2014Letter 28, 1907.\nWarned of Peril Threatening a Physician \u2014In a vision last\nnight I saw you writing. One looked over your shoulder and said,\n\u201cYou, my friend, are in danger\u201d....\nLet me tell you of a scene that I witnessed while in Oakland. [43]\nAngels clothed with beautiful garments, like angels of light, were\nescorting Dr. A from place to place, and inspiring him to speak\nwords of pompous boasting that were offensive to God.\nSoon after the Oakland conference, in the night season the Lord\nportrayed before me a scene, in which Satan, clothed in a most\nattractive disguise, was earnestly pressing close to the side of Dr. A.\nI saw and heard much. Night after night I was bowed down in agony\nof soul as I saw this personage talking with our brother.\u2014Letter 220,\n1903.\nRevealed in a Flash of Light \u2014The question is asked, How\ndoes Sister White know in regard to the matters of which she speaks\nso decidedly, as if she had authority to say these things? I speak thus\nbecause they flash upon my mind when in perplexity like lightning\nout of a dark cloud in the fury of a storm. Some scenes presented\nbefore me years ago have not been retained in my memory, but when\nthe instruction then given is needed, sometimes even when I am\nstanding before the people, the remembrance comes sharp and clear,\nlike a flash of lightning, [Commenting on the manner light often\ncame to Ellen White, W. C. White, her son, in a statement she\nfully endorsed, declared: \u201cThe things which she has written out, are\ndescriptions of flashlight pictures and other representations given her\nregarding the actions of men, and the influence of these actions upon\n42 Selected Messages Book 3\nthe work of God for the salvation of men, with views of past, present,\nand future history in its relation to this work\u201d (WCW October 30,\n1911, before GC Council; see Appendix A).\u2014Compilers.] Bringing\nto mind distinctly that particular instruction. At such times I cannot\nrefrain from saying the things that flash into my mind, not because I\nhave had a new vision, but because that which was presented to me,\nperhaps years in the past, has been recalled to my mind forcibly.\u2014\nManuscript 33, 1911.\nScenes in a Sanitarium Lobby \u2014In my dreams I was at -----\n, and I was told by my Guide to mark everything I heard and to\nobserve everything I saw. I was in a retired place, where I could not\nbe seen, but could see all that went on in the room. Persons were\nsettling accounts with you, and I heard them remonstrating with you[44]\nin regard to the large sum charged for board and room and treatment.\nI heard you with firm, decided voice refuse to lower the charge. I\nwas astonished to see that the charge was so high.\nYou seemed to be the controlling power. I saw that the impres-\nsion made by your course on the minds of those who were settling\ntheir bills was unfavorable to the institution. I heard some of your\nbrethren pleading with you, telling you that your course was unwise\nand unjust, but you were as firm as a rock in your adherence to\nyour course. You claimed that in what you were doing, you were\nworking for the good of the institution. But I saw persons go from\n----- anything but satisfied.\u2014Letter 30, 1887.\nScenes of Familiarity and Adultery \u2014While in Europe the\nthings that transpired in ----- were opened before me. A voice\nsaid, \u201cFollow me, and I will show you the sins that are practiced\nby those who stand in responsible positions.\u201d I went through the\nrooms, and I saw you, a watchman upon the walls of Zion, were very\nintimate with another man\u2019s wife, betraying sacred trusts, crucifying\nyour Lord afresh. Did you consider that there was a Watcher, the\nHoly One, who was witnessing your evil work, seeing your actions\nand hearing your words, and these are also registered in the books\nof heaven?\nShe was sitting on your lap; you were kissing her, and she was\nkissing you. Other scenes of fondness, sensual looks and deportment,\nwere presented before me, which sent a thrill of horror through my\nsoul. Your arm encircled her waist, and the fondness expressed was\nGlimpses of How the Light Came to Ellen White 43\nhaving a bewitching influence. Then a curtain was lifted, and I was\nshown you in bed with -----. My Guide said, \u201cIniquity, adultery.\u201d\u2014\nLetter 16, 1888.\nThe Message Represented as Fruit Being Given Out \u2014Your\nwork has been represented to me in figures. You were passing round\nto a company a vessel filled with most beautiful fruit. But as you\noffered them this fruit, you spoke words so harsh, and your attitude [45]\nwas so forbidding, that no one would accept it. Then Another came\nto the same company, and offered them the same fruit. And so\ncourteous and pleasant were his words and manner as he spoke of\nthe desirability of the fruit, that the vessel was emptied.\u2014Letter 164,\n1902.\nOne of Authority Counsels Regarding Locating a Sanitar-\nium\u2014In the night season I was in a council meeting where the\nbrethren were discussing the matter of the sanitarium in Los Ange-\nles. One of the brethren presented the advantages of establishing the\nsanitarium in the city of Los Angeles. Then One of Authority arose\nand presented the matter with clearness and force.\u2014Letter 40, 1902.\nContrasting Scenes; Illustrating Missionary Fervor \u2014I\nseemed to be in a large gathering. One of authority was addressing\nthe company, before whom was spread out a map of the world. He\nsaid that the map pictured God\u2019s vineyard, which must be cultivated.\nAs light from heaven shone upon anyone, that one was to reflect the\nlight to others. Lights were to be kindled in many places, and from\nthese lights still other lights were to be kindled....\nI saw jets of light shining from cities and villages, and from\nthe high places and the low places of the earth. God\u2019s word was\nobeyed, and as a result there were memorials for Him in every city\nand village. His truth was proclaimed throughout the world.\nThen this map was removed and another put in its place. On it\nlight was shining from a few places only. The rest of the world was in\ndarkness, with only a glimmer of light here and there. Our Instructor\nsaid: \u201cThis darkness is the result of men\u2019s following their own\ncourse. They have cherished hereditary and cultivated tendencies\nto evil. They have made questioning and faultfinding and accusing\nthe chief business of their lives. Their hearts are not right with God.\nThey have hidden their light under a bushel.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:28, 29.\n44 Selected Messages Book 3\nThe Study of the Word and Special Knowledge \u2014With the[46]\nlight communicated through the study of his Word, with the special\nknowledge given of individual cases among his people under all\ncircumstances and in every phase of experience, can I now be in the\nsame ignorance, the same mental uncertainty and spiritual blindness,\nas at the beginning of this experience? Will my brethren say that\nSister White has been so dull a scholar that her judgment in this\ndirection is no better than before she entered Christ\u2019s school, to be\ntrained and disciplined for a special work? Am I no more intelligent\nin regard to the duties and perils of God\u2019s people than are those\nbefore whom these things have never been presented?\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:686.\nHoly Spirit Impressed Ellen White\u2019s Mind and Heart\u2014God\nhas given me a marked, solemn experience in connection with his\nwork; and you may be assured that so long as my life is spared, I\nshall not cease to lift a warning voice as I am impressed by the Spirit\nof God, whether men will hear or whether they will forbear. I have\nno special wisdom in myself; I am only an instrument in the Lord\u2019s\nhands to do the work he has set for me to do. The instructions that I\nhave given by pen or voice have been an expression of the light that\nGod has given me. I have tried to place before you the principles\nthat the Spirit of God has for years been impressing upon my mind\nand writing on my heart.\nAnd now, brethren, I entreat you not to interpose between me\nand the people, and turn away the light which God would have come\nto them. Do not by your criticisms take out all the force, all the point\nand power, from the Testimonies. Do not feel that you can dissect\nthem to suit your own ideas, claiming that God has given you ability\nto discern what is light from heaven and what is the expression of\nmere human wisdom. If the Testimonies speak not according to the\nWord of God, reject them.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 5:691.\nIllustrated in the Location of a Food Factory\u2014In the visions\nof the night, these principles were presented to me in connection with[47]\nthe proposal for the establishment of a bakery [Note: Plans called\nfor its location about one hundred yards from the main sanitarium\nbuilding.] at Loma Linda. I was shown a large building where many\nfoods were made. There were also some smaller buildings near\nthe bakery. As I stood by, I heard loud voices in dispute over the\nGlimpses of How the Light Came to Ellen White 45\nwork that was being done. There was a lack of harmony among the\nworkers, and confusion had come in.\nThen I saw Brother Burden approach. His countenance bore\na look of anxiety and distress as he endeavored to reason with the\nworkmen, and bring them into harmony. The scene was repeated,\nand Brother Burden was often drawn away from his legitimate work\nas manager of the sanitarium, to settle variances....\nI then saw patients standing on the beautiful sanitarium grounds.\nThey had heard the disputes between the workmen. The patients did\nnot see me, but I could see them and hear them, and their remarks\nwere brought to my ears. They were expressing words of regret that\na food factory should be established on these beautiful grounds, in\nsuch close proximity to an institution for the care of the sick. Some\nwere disgusted....\nThen One appeared on the scene, and said: \u201cAll this has been\ncaused to pass before you as an object lesson, that you might see the\nresult of carrying out certain plans....\nThen, lo, the whole scene changed. The bakery building was\nnot where we had planned it, but at a distance from the sanitarium\nbuildings, on the road toward the railway. It was a humble building,\nand a small work was carried on there. The commercial idea was\nlost sight of, and, in its stead, a strong spiritual influence pervaded\nthe place.\u2014Letter 140, 1906.\nChapter 7\u2014Presenting the Divinely Revealed[48]\nMessage\nInstruction to Ellen White\u2014As the Spirit of God has opened\nto my mind the great truths of his Word, and the scenes of the past\nand the future, I have been bidden to make known to others that\nwhich has thus been revealed.\u2014The Great Controversy, xi.\nFrom the beginning of my work ...I have been called upon to\nbear a plain, pointed testimony, to reprove wrongs, and to spare\nnot.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 5:678.\nBearing Testimony\u2014Aided by the Spirit of God \u2014After I\ncome out of vision I do not at once remember all that I have seen,\nand the matter is not so clear before me until I write, then the scene\nrises before me as was presented in vision, and I can write with\nfreedom. Sometimes the things which I have seen are hid from me\nafter I come out of vision, and I cannot call them to mind until I am\nbrought before a company where the vision applies, then the things\nwhich I have seen come to my mind with force.\nI am just as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in relating or\nwriting a vision as in having the vision. It is impossible for me to\ncall up things which have been shown me unless the Lord brings\nthem before me at the time that he is pleased to have me relate or[49]\nwrite them.\u2014Spiritual Gifts 2:292, 293.\nMust Be Impressed by the Holy Spirit \u2014I cannot at my own\nimpulse take up a work and launch out into it. I have to be impressed\nby the Spirit of God. I cannot write unless the Holy Spirit helps\nme. Sometimes I cannot write at all. Then again I am aroused at\neleven, twelve, and one o\u2019clock; and I can write as fast as my hand\ncan move over the paper.\u2014Letter 11, 1903.\nWhen Pen Taken in Hand\u2014As soon as I take my pen in hand\nI am not in darkness as to what to write. It is as plain and clear as\na voice speaking to me, \u201cI will instruct thee and teach thee in the\nway which thou shalt go.\u201d \u201cIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and\nhe shall direct [make plain] thy paths.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 89, 1900.\n46\nPresenting the Divinely Revealed Message 47\nI am very busy with my writing.

It\ngreatly hurts me to do this, and it is a long time before I recover\nfrom the strain that such an experience brings on me.\u2014Letter 17,\n1903.\nWork Made Sure by Both Oral and Written Messages\u2014The\nmessages that God has given me have been communicated to his\npeople both by word of mouth and in printed form. Thus my work\nhas been made doubly sure.\nI am instructed that the Lord, by his infinite power, has preserved\nthe right hand of his messenger for more than half a century, in order\nthat the truth may be written out as he bids me write it for publication\nin periodicals and books.\u2014Letter 136, 1906.\nWhether Past or Future She Could Not Say \u2014I have been\nurged by the Spirit of the Lord to fully warn our people in regard\nto the undue familiarity of married men with women, and women\nwith men. This lovesick sentimentalism existed in the [city] mission\nat _____ before you were connected with it. I was shown you with\nothers manifesting the same; whether this was in the past or the [55]\nfuture I cannot say, for often things are presented to me long before\nthe circumstances take place.\u2014Letter 17, 1891.\nShown as If Work Was Done\u2014I have been thinking of how,\nafter we began sanitarium work in Battle Creek, sanitarium buildings\nall ready for occupation were shown to me in vision. The Lord\ninstructed me as to the way in which the work in these buildings\nshould be conducted in order for it to exert a saving influence on the\npatients.\nAll this seemed very real to me, but when I awoke I found that\nthe work was yet to be done, that there were no buildings erected.\nAnother time I was shown a large building going up on the site\non which the Battle Creek Sanitarium was afterward erected. The\n52 Selected Messages Book 3\nbrethren were in great perplexity as to who should take charge of\nthe work. I wept sorely. One of authority stood up among us, and\nsaid, \u201cNot yet. You are not ready to invest means in that building, or\nto plan for its future management.\u201d\nAt this time the foundation of the sanitarium had been laid. But\nwe needed to learn the lesson of waiting.\u2014Letter 135, 1903.\nPaul Shown in Advance Dangers That Would Arise \u2014Paul\nwas an inspired apostle, yet the Lord did not reveal to him at all\ntimes just the condition of his people. Those who were interested\nin the prosperity of the church, and saw evils creeping in, presented\nthe matter before him, and from the light which he had previously\nreceived he was prepared to judge of the true character of these\ndevelopments. Because the Lord had not given him a new revelation\nfor that special time, those who were really seeking light did not cast\nhis message aside as only a common letter. No, indeed. The Lord\nhad shown him the difficulties and dangers which would arise in the\nchurches, that when they should develop he might know just how to\ntreat them.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 5:65.\nEllen White Could Now Speak \u2014This morning I attended a[56]\nmeeting where a select few were called together to consider some\nquestions that were presented to them by a letter soliciting consider-\nation and advice on these subjects. Of some of these subjects I could\nspeak, because at sundry times and in divers places many things\nhave been presented to me.... As my brethren read the selections\nfrom letters, I knew what to say to them; for this matter has been pre-\nsented to me again and again in regard to the southern field. I have\nnot felt at liberty to write out the matter until now.... The light that\nthe Lord has given me at different times has been that the southern\nfield, where the greatest share of the population of the colored race\nis, cannot be worked after the same methods as other fields.\u2014Letter\n73, 1895 (Published in The Southern Work, 72.)\nWhen the Time Is Fully Come \u2014I must not write more now,\nalthough there is much more that I shall write when I know that the\ntime has fully come.\u2014Letter 124, 1902.\nDeferred for a Year \u2014The Lord did help and bless me in a\nsignal manner during the conference in Melbourne. I labored, before\nI entered it, very hard, giving personal testimonies which I had\nwritten out one year before, but could not feel clear to send them.\nPresenting the Divinely Revealed Message 53\nI thought of the words of Christ, \u201cI have yet many things to say\nunto you, but ye cannot bear them now\u201d (John 16:12). When I\nenclosed the communication all ready to mail, it seemed that a voice\nspoke to me saying, \u201cNot yet, not yet, they will not receive your\ntestimony.\u201d\u2014Letter 39, 1893.\nVisions Not Always First Understood \u2014On one occasion\nwhen we were talking together about your experience in your work,\nyou asked me, \u201cHave you told me all?\u201d I could not say more at\nthat time. Often representations are given me which at first I do\nnot understand, but after a time they are made plain by a repeated\npresentation of those things that I did not at first comprehend, and in\nways that make their meaning clear and unmistakable.\u2014Letter 329,\n1904.\nWhat I Wrote Seemed New\u2014In the night I am aroused from [57]\nmy sleep, and I write in my diary many things that appear as new to\nme when read, as to any who hear them. If I did not see the matter in\nmy own handwriting I should not think my pen had traced it.\u2014Letter\n118, 1898.\nFormer Writings Timely\u2014I have a large amount of precious\nmatter, written at Cooranbong [Australia], and dated December 20,\n1896, which is just what is needed at this time. I will have it copied\ntoday, and if it is possible get it off in the evening mail. I had lost all\ntrace of these manuscripts, but this morning a pile of copies attracted\nmy attention, which on looking over, I found to my surprise to be\njust what I wanted.\u2014Letter 262, 1907.\nMinds Must Be Prepared Spiritually\u2014I have tried to not shun\nto give to our people the whole counsel of God, but have sometimes\ndeferred matters with the injunction, \u201cThey cannot bear them now.\u201d\nEven truth cannot be presented in its fullness before minds that are\nin no preparation spiritually to receive it. I have many things to\nsay, but persons to whom the messages apply cannot in their present\nunconsecrated state bear them.\u2014Letter 55, 1894.\nWhy Paul Could Not Tell All \u2014The great apostle had many\nvisions. The Lord showed him many things that it is not lawful for a\nman to utter. Why could he not tell the believers what he had seen?\nBecause they would have made a misapplication of the great truths\npresented. They would not have been able to comprehend these\n54 Selected Messages Book 3\ntruths. And yet all that was shown to Paul molded the messages that\nGod gave him to bear to the churches.\u2014Letter 161, 1903.\nNo Claim for Special Light for Biographical Writings \u2014In\npreparing the following pages [Spiritual Gifts, vol. 2, which is an\nautobiographical account], I have labored under great disadvantages,\nas I have had to depend in many instances on memory, having kept\nno journal till within a few years. In several instances I have sent the[58]\nmanuscripts to friends who were present when the circumstances\nrelated occurred, for their examination before they were put in print.\nI have taken great care, and have spent much time, in endeavoring\nto state the simple facts as correctly as possible.\nI have, however, been much assisted in arriving at dates by the\nmany letters which I wrote.\u2014Preface to Spiritual Gifts, vol. 2.\nA special request is made that if any find incorrect statements\nin this book they will immediately inform me. The edition will\nbe completed about the first of October; therefore send before that\ntime.\u2014Ibid., Appendix in first 400 copies.\nDistinction Between Common and Religious Subjects \u2014\nThere are times when common things must be stated, common\nthoughts must occupy the mind, common letters must be written\nand information given that has passed from one to another of the\nworkers. Such words, such information, are not given under the\nspecial inspiration of the Spirit of God. Questions are asked at times\nthat are not upon religious subjects at all, and these questions must\nbe answered. We converse about houses and lands, trades to be\nmade, and locations for our institutions, their advantages and disad-\nvantages.\u2014Manuscript 107, 1909 (Published in Selected Messages\n1:39.)\nThe Point Illustrated\u2014I have not been given the message, Send\nfor Brother C to come to Australia. No; therefore I do not say, I\nknow that this is the place for you. But it is my privilege to express\nmy wishes, even though I say, I speak not by commandment.\nBut I do not want you to come because of any persuasion of\nmine. I want you to seek the Lord most earnestly, and then follow\nwhere He shall lead you, I want you to come when God says, Come,\nnot one moment before.\nNevertheless, it is my privilege to present the wants of the work\nof God in Australia. Australia is not my country only as it is the\nPresenting the Divinely Revealed Message 55\nLord\u2019s province. The country is God\u2019s; the people are His. A [59]\nwork is to be done here, and if you are not the one to do it, I shall\nfeel perfectly resigned to hear that you have gone to some other\nlocality.\u2014Letter 129, 1897 (From a letter concerning the need for\na sanitarium in Australia and the possibility of this man coming to\nAustralia to launch such an enterprise.)\nInformation Gained From Those Who Should Know \u2014The\ninformation given concerning the number of rooms in the Paradise\nValley Sanitarium was given, not as a revelation from the Lord, but\nsimply as a human opinion. There has never been revealed to me the\nexact number of rooms in any of our sanitariums; and the knowledge\nI have obtained of such things I have gained by inquiring of those\nwho were supposed to know. In my words, when speaking upon\nthese common subjects, there is nothing to lead minds to believe that\nI receive my knowledge in a vision from the Lord and am stating\nit as such.\u2014Manuscript 107, 1909 (Quoted in Selected Messages\n1:38.)\nTwo Kinds of Letters\u2014Dear Children [Edson and Emma]: I\nhave had many matters to write out, and I have been hard at work.\nMy heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord. We are in no case to be\ndoubtful, but hopeful.\nThis morning I found your letter under my door. I was glad to\nhear from you. Yesterday I wrote you a letter on common, everyday\ntopics. [See next quotation.] This letter will be sent today. I have\nwritten a long letter on the subject spoken of in your letter, and have\ngiven it out to be copied. This will be sent to you soon....\nFrom the instruction that the Lord has given me from time to\ntime, I know that there should be workers who make medical evan-\ngelistic tours among the towns and villages. Those who do this work\nwill gather a rich harvest of souls, both from the higher and the lower\nclasses.\u2014Letter 202, 1903.\nThe Letter Dealing With Common Matters\u2014Dear Children\nEdson and Emma.\u2014It has been a long time since I have written to\nyou. I should be very much pleased to visit you in your own home. [60]\nWillie writes me that he is much pleased with your situation. I have\nnot heard from you for a long time. I should be so glad to get a letter\nfrom you, even if it is only a few lines. And remember that if at\nany time you wish to pay us a visit, to counsel about your work and\n56 Selected Messages Book 3\nabout the books that we are trying to get out, I shall be more than\nglad to see you.\nIt seems a long time since Willie left us. He went away the last\nof June, and it is now the tenth of September. He will not be home\nfor a week yet....\u2014Letter 201, 1903.\nSister White\u2019s Judgment\u2014You have evidenced your opinion\nof your own judgment\u2014that it was more reliable than Sister White\u2019s.\nDid you consider that Sister White has been dealing with just such\ncases during her life of service for the Master, that cases similar to\nyour own and many varieties of cases have passed before her that\nshould make her know what is right and what is wrong in these\nthings? Is a judgment that has been under the training of God for\nmore than fifty years of no preference to those who have not had\nthis discipline and education? Please consider these things.\u2014Letter\n115, 1895.\nDared Not Speak When There Was No Special Light\u2014I find\nmyself frequently placed where I dare give neither assent nor dissent\nto propositions that are submitted to me; for there is danger that any\nwords I may speak shall be reported as something that the Lord has\ngiven me. It is not always safe for me to express my own judgment;\nfor sometimes when someone wishes to carry out his own purpose,\nhe will regard any favorable word I may speak as special light from\nthe Lord. I shall be cautious in all my movements.\u2014Letter 162,\n1907, p. 2.\nNote: Except for that which is in the nature of everyday matters\nor biographical, that which Mrs. White set before the people was\nbased upon the visions given to her, whether or not she used the term\n\u201cI saw.\u201d She, in her day, and we today, draw the line, not between\nbooks and letters, et cetera, but between the sacred and the common.[61]\nno one need be confused.\nMrs. White, in books intended for the reading of the general\npublic, designedly left out all expressions such as \u201cI saw\u201d and \u201cI\nwas shown,\u201d lest the readers, being unfamiliar with her experience,\nshould have their minds diverted from the message itself. one looks\nin vain through the five volumes of the Conflict Series for one such\nexpression, yet in her introduction to The Great Controversy, the\nfirst of the series that appeared in 1888, and elsewhere, she makes\nit known that she witnessed events take place and was \u201cbidden to\nPresenting the Divinely Revealed Message 57\nmake known to others that which has been revealed\u201d (p. xi). See\nalso Steps to Christ, Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons, Education, and The Ministry of Healing. \u201cSister\nWhite is not the originator of these books,\u201d she wrote.\nChapter 8\u2014The Question of Influence[62]\nWho Has Told Sister White? \u2014Those who have disregarded\nthe messages of warning have lost their bearings. Some, in their\nself-confidence, have dared to turn from that which they knew to be\ntruth, with the words, \u201cWho has told Sister White?\u201d These words\nshow the measure of their faith and confidence in the work that the\nLord has given me to do. They have before them the result of the\nwork that the Lord has laid upon me, and if this does not convince\nthem, no arguments, no future revelations, would affect them. The\nresult will be that God will speak again in judgment as He has spoken\nheretofore.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 19, 1903, p. 8.\nDid Anyone Tell Her These Things?\u2014Some are ready to in-\nquire: \u201cWho told Sister White these things?\u201d They have even put the\nquestion to me: \u201cDid anyone tell you these things?\u201d I could answer\nthem: \u201cYes; yes, the angel of God has spoken to me.\u201d But what they\nmean is: \u201cHave the brethren and sisters been exposing their faults?\u201d\nFor the future, I shall not belittle the testimonies that God has given\nme, to make explanations to try to satisfy such narrow minds, but\nshall treat all such questions as an insult to the Spirit of God. God\nhas seen fit to thrust me into positions in which He has not placed\nany other one in our ranks. He has laid upon me burdens of reproof[63]\nthat He has not given to any other one.\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n3:314, 315.\nSomeone Has Told Sister White \u2014Even now unbelief is ex-\npressed by the words, \u201cWho has written these things to Sister\nWhite?\u201d But I know of no one who knows them as they are, and no\none who could write that which he does not suppose has an exis-\ntence. Someone has told me\u2014He who does not falsify, misjudge,\nor exaggerate any case.\u2014Special Instruction Relating to the Review\nand Herald Office and the Work in Battle Creek, p. 16.\nUntrustworthy if Influenced\u2014You think individuals have prej-\nudiced my mind. If I am in this state, I am not fitted to be entrusted\nwith the work of God.\u2014Letter 16, 1893.\n58\nQuestion of Influence 59\nMrs. White Did Not Read Certain Letters or Articles\u2014You\nmay blame me for not reading your package of writings. I did not\nread them, neither did I read the letters that Dr. Kellogg sent. I had a\nmessage of stern rebuke for the publishing house, and I knew that if\nI read the communications sent to me, later on, when the testimony\ncame out, you and Dr. Kellogg would be tempted to say, \u201cI gave her\nthat inspiration.\u201d\u2014Letter 301, 1905.\nI have not been in the habit of reading any doctrinal articles in\nthe paper [the Review and Herald], that my mind should not have\nany understanding of anyone\u2019s ideas and views, and that not a mold\nof any man\u2019s theories should have any connection with that which I\nwrite.\u2014Letter 37, 1887.\nA Question Raised in Early Ministry\u2014What if you had said\never so much, would that affect the visions that God gives me? If so,\nthen the visions are nothing.... What you or anyone else has said is\nnothing at all. God has taken the matter in hand.... What you have\nsaid, Sister D, influenced me not at all. My opinion has nothing to\ndo with what God has shown me in vision.\u2014Letter 6, 1851.\nReproof Not From Hearsay \u2014I received your letter and will [64]\nendeavor to answer it. You say that you received the testimonies, but\nthe portion in regard to deception you do not receive. Nevertheless,\nmy brother, it is true, and hearsay has nothing to do with this case of\nreproof.\u2014Letter 28, 1888.\nAn Attempt to Guide Mrs. White\u2014Brother E suggests that it\nwould please the people if I speak less about duty and more in regard\nto the love of Jesus. But I wish to speak as the Spirit of the Lord\nshall impress me. The Lord knows best what this people needs. I\nspoke in the forenoon [Sabbath, October 17] from Isaiah 58. I did\nnot round the corners at all.\u2014Manuscript 26, 1885.\nManipulated by One Mighty in Counsel \u2014There are those\nwho say, \u201cSomeone manipulates her writings.\u201d I acknowledge the\ncharge. It is One who is mighty in counsel, One who presents before\nme the condition of things.\u2014Letter 52, 1906.\nWhy Inquiries Were at Times Made\u2014I am told by one who\nmade a confession to me that doubts and unbelief had been cherished\nby them against the testimonies because of the words spoken to\nthem by Sister F. One thing mentioned was that the testimonies to\nindividuals had been told me by others and I gave them, purporting\n60 Selected Messages Book 3\nto be a message from God. Does my sister know that in this she is\nmaking me a hypocrite and a liar? ...\nOne case was mentioned by Sister F, that she had told me all\nabout the case of Brother G\u2019s family, and the next thing she heard I\nwas relating the very things she had told me as what the Lord had\nshown me.\nLet me explain. I am often shown families and individuals and\nwhen I have an opportunity with those who are acquainted with\nthem, I make inquiry how that family is standing for the purpose\nof ascertaining if ministers or people have any knowledge of the\nexisting evils.\nThis was the fact in the case concerning Brother G\u2019s family.\nI wished to see if the testimony was substantiated by facts. But\nthat information given did not originate the testimony, although[65]\nshortsighted, tempted souls may thus interpret it.\u2014Letter 17, 1887.\nWho Told Paul and Sister White?\u2014When a testimony from\nthe Lord is borne to the erring there is often a question asked: Who\ntold Sister White? This must have been the case in the days of Paul,\nfor someone must have [had] the interest of the church at heart to\npresent before the apostle, God\u2019s appointed minister, the dangers of\nthe members of the church which threatened its prosperity. There\nis a time to speak and a time to keep silence. Of course, something\nmust be done, and the Lord\u2019s appointed minister must not fail in his\nwork to correct these evils. Now these evils were existing, and Paul\nhad a work to do to counteract them....\nWe know that Paul had presented before him the state of the\nchurches. God has given him light and knowledge in regard to the\norder that should be maintained in the churches, the evils that would\narise, and which would have to be corrected and firmly dealt with\ncorresponding to their aggravated character. The Lord had revealed\nto Paul the purity, the devotion and piety that should be maintained\nin the church, and things arising contrary to this he knew must be\nreproved according to the light given him of God.\nWhy Inquiries Are Made\u2014When matters are brought before\nmy mind in regard to a church, sometimes there flashes, as it were,\na light from heaven revealing particulars that God had presented\nbefore me of that case, and when the burden is bearing upon my\nmind in reference to special churches, families or individuals, I\nQuestion of Influence 61\nfrequently inquire the condition of things in the church, and the\nmatter is all written out before I come to that church.\nBut I want facts to substantiate the testimonies, and I am bur-\ndened to know in what manner I should bring out the light God has\ngiven me. If the errors have been manifestly affecting the church, the\nexamples of a character to mislead the church, weaken it in faith and\nstrengthen unbelief, then the work to be done must not be confined to [66]\nfamilies privately or to individuals alone, but must come before the\nwhole church to stay the evil and flash light into the minds of those\nwho have been deceived by deceptive works and misinterpretations.\nAgain, when before the people, there flashes upon me light that\nGod has given me in the past in reference to the faces which were\nbefore me, and I have been impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to\nspeak. This is the way I have been used, viewing many cases, and\nbefore I bring these cases out, I wish to know whether the case is\nknown by others; whether their influence is calculated to injure the\nchurch generally. Questions are sometimes asked and sometimes it\ndetermines the manner of treating these cases, whether before many\nor few, or before the persons themselves.\nIf the case is such that it can be dealt with privately, and others\nneed not know, I greatly desire to do all possible to correct and not\ngive publicity to the matter.\u2014Letter 17, 1887.\nI Stand Alone, Severely Alone \u2014I have a statement to make.\nWhen the Lord presents before me any matter and instruction and I\nhave a message to bear concerning the said matter, then I shall, to\nthe best of my God-given ability, make known the matter, presenting\nthe mind and will of God just as clearly as my human capabilities,\nguided and controlled by the Holy Spirit, shall bring all the matter\nbefore me to present to others. In regard to the serious matters given\nme I have not given anyone\u2014man or woman\u2014any right to have the\nleast control over my work the Lord has given me to do.\nSince twenty-one years ago, when I was deprived of my husband\nby death, I have not had the slightest idea of ever marrying again.\nWhy? Not because God forbade it. No. But to stand alone was the\nbest for me, that no one should suffer with me in carrying forward\nmy work entrusted to me of God. And no one should have a right to\ninfluence me in any way in reference to my responsibility and my\nwork in bearing my testimony of encouragement and reproof. [67]\n62 Selected Messages Book 3\nMy husband never stood in my way to do this, although I had\nhelp and encouragement from him and oft his pity. His sympathy and\nprayers and tears I have missed so much, so very much. No one can\nunderstand this as myself. But my work has to be done. No human\npower should give the least supposition that I would be influenced in\nthe work God has given me to do in bearing my testimony to those\nfor whom He has given me reproof or encouragement.\nI have been alone in this matter, severely alone with all the\ndifficulties and all the trials connected with the work. God alone\ncould help me. The last work that is to be done by me in this world\nwill soon be finished. I must express myself plainly, in a manner, if\npossible, not to be misunderstood.\nI have not one person in the world who shall put any message in\nmy mind or lay one duty upon me. I am now to say to you, Brother\nF, when the Lord gives me a burden for you or for anyone, you shall\nhave it in the way and manner the Lord gives it to me.\u2014Manuscript\n227, 1902.\nChapter 9\u2014Defining Sister White\u2019s Judgment and [68]\nthe Word of the Lord\nSister White\u2019s Opinion?\nThe Position of Part Human, Part Divine\u2014Many times in my\nexperience I have been called upon to meet the attitude of a certain\nclass, who acknowledged that the testimonies were from God, but\ntook the position that this matter and that matter were Sister White\u2019s\nopinion and judgment. This suits those who do not love reproof\nand correction, and who, if their ideas are crossed, have occasion to\nexplain the difference between the human and the divine.\nIf the preconceived opinions or particular ideas of some are\ncrossed in being reproved by testimonies, they have a burden at once\nto make plain their position to discriminate between the testimonies,\ndefining what is Sister White\u2019s human judgment, and what is the\nword of the Lord. Everything that sustains their cherished ideas is\ndivine, and the testimonies to correct their errors are human\u2014Sister\nWhite\u2019s opinions. They make of none effect the counsel of God by\ntheir tradition.\u2014Manuscript 16, 1889.\nVirtually Rejecting the Testimonies \u2014You have talked over\nmatters as you viewed them, that the communications from Sister [69]\nWhite are not all from the Lord, but a portion is her own mind, her\nown judgment, which is no better than anybody else\u2019s judgment and\nideas. This is one of Satan\u2019s hooks to hang your doubts upon to\ndeceive your soul and the souls of others who will dare to draw the\nline in this matter and say, this portion which pleases me is from\nGod, but that portion which points out and condemns my course of\nconduct is from Sister White alone, and bears not the holy signet.\nYou have in this way virtually rejected the whole of the messages,\nwhich God in His tender, pitying love has sent to you to save you\nfrom moral ruin....\nThere is One back of me which is the Lord, who has prompted\nthe message which you now reject and disregard and dishonor. By\n63\n64 Selected Messages Book 3\ntempting God you have unnerved yourselves, and confusion and\nblindness of mind has been the result.\u2014Letter 16, 1888.\nThis Is Not My Opinion \u2014After I wrote you the long letter\nwhich has been belittled by Elder H as merely an expression of my\nown opinion, while at the Southern California Camp Meeting, the\nLord partially removed the restriction, and I write what I do. I dare\nnot say more now, lest I go beyond what the Spirit of the Lord has\npermitted me.\nWhen Professor I came, I put to him a few pointed questions,\nmore to learn how he regarded the condition of things, than to obtain\ninformation. I felt that the crisis had come. Had Elder H, and\nthose united with him, been standing in the light, they would have\nrecognized the voice of warning and reproof; but he calls it a human\nwork, and casts it aside. The work he is doing he will wish undone\nere long. He is weaving a net around himself that he cannot easily\nbreak. This is not my opinion.\nWhat voice will you acknowledge as the voice of God? What\npower has the Lord in reserve to correct your errors, and show you\nyour course as it is? What power to work in the church? You have,\nby your own course, closed every avenue whereby the Lord would\nreach you. Will He raise one from the dead to speak to you? ... [70]\nIn the testimonies sent to Battle Creek, I have given you the light\nGod has given to me. In no case have I given my own judgment or\nopinion. I have enough to write of what has been shown me, without\nfalling back on my own opinions. You are doing as the children of\nIsrael did again and again. Instead of repenting before God, you\nreject His words, and attribute all the warnings and reproof to the\nmessenger whom the Lord sends.\u2014Testimony for the Battle Creek\nChurch, 50-58 (1882).\nPermit me to express my mind, and yet not my mind, but the\nword of the Lord.\u2014Letter 89, 1899 (Quoted in Counsels to Writers\nand Editors, 112.)\nSatan Will Help Those Who Feel They Must Discriminate\u2014\nI have my work to do, to meet the misconceptions of those who\nsuppose themselves able to say what is testimony from God and what\nis human production. If those who have done this work continue in\nthis course, satanic agencies will choose for them....\nDefining Sister White\u2019s Judgment and the Word of the Lord 65\nThose who have helped souls to feel at liberty to specify what\nis of God in the Testimonies and what are the uninspired words of\nSister White, will find that they were helping the devil in his work of\ndeception.

In the judgment,\nwhat can you who have done this, offer to God as an excuse for\nturning from the evidences He has given you that God was in the\nwork?\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 466.\nChapter 10\u2014On Being an Inspired Messenger[71]\nExperiences as God\u2019s Messenger Recounted\u2014For half a cen-\ntury I have been the Lord\u2019s messenger, and as long as my life shall\nlast I shall continue to bear the messages that God gives me for\nHis people. I take no glory to myself. In my youth the Lord made\nme His messenger, to communicate to His people testimonies of\nencouragement, warning, and reproof. For sixty years I have been\nin communication with heavenly messengers, and I have been con-\nstantly learning in reference to divine things, and in reference to\nthe way in which God is constantly working to bring souls from the\nerror of their ways to the light in God\u2019s light.\nMany souls have been helped because they have believed that the\nmessages given me were sent in mercy to the erring. When I have\nseen those who needed a different phase of Christian experience, I\nhave told them so, for their present and eternal good. And so long\nas the Lord spares my life, I will do my work faithfully, whether or\nnot men and women shall hear and receive and obey. My work is\nclearly given me to do, and I shall receive grace in being obedient.\nI love God. I love Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and I feel an\nintense interest in every soul who claims to be a child of God. I am\ndetermined to be a faithful steward so long as the Lord shall spare[72]\nmy life. I will not fail nor be discouraged.\nBut for months my soul has been passing through intense agony\non account of those who have received the sophistries of Satan and\nare communicating the same to others, [Reference to pantheistic\nteachings.] making every conceivable interpretation in various ways\nto destroy confidence in the gospel message for this last generation,\nand in the special work which God has given me to do. I know that\nthe Lord has given me this work, and I have no excuse to make for\nwhat I have done.\nIn my experience I am constantly receiving evidence of the\nsustaining miracle-working power of God upon my body and my\nsoul, which I have dedicated to the Lord. I am not my own; I have\n66\nOn Being an Inspired Messenger 67\nbeen bought with a price and I have such assurance of the Lord\u2019s\nworking in my behalf that I must acknowledge His abundant grace....\nWhy should I complain? So many times has the Lord raised me\nup from sickness, so wonderfully has He sustained me, that I can\nnever doubt. I have so many unmistakable evidences of His special\nblessings, that I could not possibly doubt. He gives me freedom\nto speak His truth before large numbers of people. Not only when\nI am standing before large congregations is special help bestowed\nupon me, but when I am using my pen, wonderful representations\nare given me of past, present, and future.\u2014Letter 86, 1906.\nGiven Tongue and Utterance\u2014Of all the precious assurances\nGod has given me regarding my work, none has been more precious\nto me than this, that He would give me tongue and utterance wher-\never I should go. In places where there was the greatest opposition,\nevery tongue was silenced. I have spoken the plain message to our\nown people and to the multitude, and my words have been accepted\nas coming from the Lord.\u2014Letter 84, 1909.\nEllen G. White Message Consistent Through the Years \u2014 [73]\nThe meeting on Sunday afternoon was attended by many of the\ncitizens of Battle Creek. They paid the best of attention. At this\nmeeting I had opportunity to state decidedly that my views have not\nchanged. The blessing of the Lord rested upon many of those who\nheard the words spoken. I said: \u201cYou may be anxious to know what\nMrs. White believes. You have heard her speak many times.... She\nhas the same service to do for the Master that she had when she\naddressed the people of Battle Creek years ago. She receives lessons\nfrom the same Instructor. The directions given her are, \u2018Write the\nmessages that I give you, that the people may have them.\u2019 These\nmessages have been written as God has given them to me.\u201d\u2014Letter\n39, 1905.\nE. G. White\u2019s Confidence in the Divine Source of Her Rev-\nelations\u2014What a battle I am obliged to fight! My brethren seem\nto judge me as taking positions that are not necessary. They do not\nsee that God in His own wisdom has made revelations to me which\ncannot successfully be contradicted or disputed. Nothing can rub out\nthat which has been presented to me and imprinted on the tablets of\nmy soul. All the oppositions or gain-saying to make my testimony\nof none effect only compels from me, by the urgency of the Spirit of\n68 Selected Messages Book 3\nGod, a more decided repetition, and to stand on the light revealed\nwith all the force of the strength God has given me.\u2014Manuscript\n25, 1890.\nMeet the Danger Positively\u2014Satan will continue to bring in\nhis erroneous theories and to claim that his sentiments are true.\nSeducing spirits are at work. I am to meet the danger positively,\ndenying the right of anyone to use my writings to serve the devil\u2019s\npurpose to allure and deceive the people of God. [Advocates of\npantheistic teachings used E. G. White writings to bolster their\nerroneous views.] God has spared my life that I may present the\ntestimonies given me, to vindicate that which God vindicates, and to[74]\ndenounce every vestige of Satan\u2019s sophistry. One thing will follow\nanother in spiritual sophistry, to deceive if possible the very elect.\u2014\nManuscript 126, 1905.\nUnmoved by Opposition \u2014The greatest tirade may be made\nagainst me, but it will not change in the least my mission or my\nwork. We have had this to meet again and again. The Lord gave me\nthe message when I was only 17 years old.... The message the Lord\nhas given me to bear has been in a straight line from light to light,\nupward and onward from truth to advanced truth.\u2014Manuscript 29,\n1897.\nNo Claim to the Title \u201cProphetess.\u201d\u2014During the discourse [at\nBattle Creek, October 2, 1904], I said that I did not claim to be a\nprophetess. Some were surprised at this statement, and as much is\nbeing said in regard to it, I will make an explanation. Others have\ncalled me a prophetess, but I have never assumed that title. I have not\nfelt that it was my duty thus to designate myself. Those who boldly\nassume that they are prophets in this our day are often a reproach to\nthe cause of Christ.\nMy work includes much more than this name signifies. I regard\nmyself as a messenger, entrusted by the Lord with messages for His\npeople.\u2014Letter 55, 1905 (In Selected Messages 1:35, 36.)\nThe Work of a Prophet and More\u2014I am now instructed that I\nam not to be hindered in my work by those who engage in supposi-\ntions regarding its nature, whose minds are struggling with so many\nintricate problems connected with the supposed work of a prophet.\nMy commission embraces the work of a prophet, but it does not end\nthere. It embraces much more than the minds of those who have\nOn Being an Inspired Messenger 69\nbeen sowing the seeds of unbelief can comprehend.\u2014Letter 244,\n1906 (Addressed to elders of the Battle Creek church; See Selected\nMessages 1:34-36.)\nNo Self-vindication\u2014My heart feels very sad that Brethren J\nand K have taken the position which they have.... You may inquire,\n\u201cWhat effect does this have upon you?\u201d Sorrow only, sorrow of soul, [75]\nbut peace and perfect rest and trust in Jesus. To vindicate myself,\nmy position, or my mission, I would not utter ten words. I would\nnot seek to give evidence of my work. \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know\nthem\u201d (Matthew 7:20).\u2014Letter 14, 1897.\nLeaving Consequences With God \u2014I am sometimes greatly\nburdened in the night season. I rise from my bed, and walk the room,\npraying to the Lord to help me bear the burden, and say nothing to\nmake the people believe that the message He has given me is truth.\nWhen I can lay this burden on the Lord, I am free indeed. I enjoy\na peace that I cannot express. I feel lifted up, as if borne by the\neverlasting arms, and peace and joy fill my soul.\nI am again and again reminded that I am not to try to clear away\nthe confusion and contradiction of faith and feeling and unbelief\nthat is expressed. I am not to be depressed, but am to speak the\nwords of the Lord with authority, and then leave with Him all the\nconsequences.\nI am instructed by the Great Physician to speak the word that the\nLord gives me, whether men will hear or whether they will forebear.\nI am told that I have nothing to do with the consequences, that God,\neven the Lord Jehovah, will keep me in perfect peace if I will rest in\nHis love and do the work He has given me.\u2014Letter 146, 1902.\nWill Not Confess the Sins Known Only to Those Involved\u2014\nYour brethren, or many of them, do not know that which you yourself\nand the Lord know.... I have determined that I will not confess the\nsins of those who profess to believe the truth, but leave these things\nfor them to confess.\u2014Letter 113, 1893.\nE. G. White Benefited by the Message Given\u2014I long to speak\nto large congregations, knowing that the message is not of myself\nbut that which the Lord impresses upon my mind to utter. I am never\nleft alone when I stand before the people with a message. When\nbefore the people there seems to be presented before me the most [76]\nprecious things of the gospel and I participate in the gospel message\n70 Selected Messages Book 3\nand feed upon the Word as much as any of the hearers. The sermons\ndo me good, for I have new representations every time I open my\nlips to speak to the people.\nI can never doubt my mission, for I am a participant in the\nprivileges and am nourished and vivified, knowing that I am called\nunto the grace of Christ. Every time I set forth the truth to the\npeople, and call their attention to eternal life which Christ has made\npossible for us to obtain, I am as much benefited as they with most\ngracious discoveries of the grace and love and the power of God in\nbehalf of His people, in justification and reconciliation with God.\u2014\nManuscript 174, 1903.\nThe Privilege of Being God\u2019s Messenger\u2014I am very thankful\nthat the Lord has given me the privilege of being His messenger to\ncommunicate precious truth to others.\u2014Letter 80, 1911.\nAfter Ellen White\u2019s Death\nE. G. White\u2019s Writings to Continue to Witness\u2014I am to trace\nthis testimony on paper, that should I fall asleep in Jesus, the witness\nto the truth might still be borne.\u2014Letter 116, 1905.\nTo Speak to the End \u2014Abundant light has been given to our\npeople in these last days. Whether or not my life is spared, my\nwritings will constantly speak, and their work will go forward as\nlong as time shall last. My writings are kept on file in the office, and\neven though I should not live, these words that have been given to me\nby the Lord will still have life and will speak to the people.\u2014Letter\n371, 1907 (Published in Selected Messages 1:55.)\nMessages to Be of Greater Force After Prophet\u2019s Death \u2014\nPhysically, I have always been as a broken vessel; and yet in my old\nage the Lord continues to move upon me by His Holy Spirit to write\nthe most important books that have ever come before the churches\nand the world. The Lord is evidencing what He can do through weak[77]\nvessels. The life that He spares I will use to His glory. And, when\nHe may see fit to let me rest, His messages shall be of even more\nvital force than when the frail instrumentality through whom they\nwere delivered, was living.\u2014Manuscript 122, 1903.\nChapter 11\u2014The Reception of the Messages [78]\nMessages of Encouragement, Warning, and Reproof \u2014For\nhalf a century I have been the Lord\u2019s messenger, and as long as my\nlife shall last I shall continue to bear the messages that God gives\nme for His people. I take no glory to myself; in my youth the Lord\nmade me His messenger, to communicate to His people testimonies\nof encouragement, warning, and reproof. For sixty years I have\nbeen in communication with heavenly messengers, and I have been\nconstantly learning in reference to divine things, and in reference to\nthe way in which God is constantly working to bring souls from the\nerror of their ways to the light in God\u2019s light.\u2014Letter 86, 1906.\nSome Receive, Some Reject \u2014I have a work to do for those\nwho will be helped, even if the light given does not harmonize with\ntheir ideas. They will recognize the light from God, because they\nhave the fruits of the work which the Lord has been pleased to do\nthrough His humble instrument in the last forty-five years. They\nacknowledge this work to be of God, and are therefore willing to be\ncorrected in their ideas and to change their course of action.\nBut those who will maintain and retain their own ideas, and [79]\nbecause they are corrected, conclude that Sister White is influenced\nto take a certain course of action which is not in harmony with their\nideas ...could not be benefited. I would not consider such friends to\nbe of any value in a hard place, especially in a crisis. Now you have\nmy mind. I do not want to do the work of God in a bungling manner.\nI want to know what duty is and move in harmony with the Spirit of\nGod.\u2014Letter 3, 1889.\nEllen White\u2019s Letter a Message From God \u2014You ask if the\nLord gave me that letter to give to you. I say He did. That Holy God\nof Israel will not serve with your sins. That message was given of\nGod. If you have had, since that message was given, a new sense of\nwhat constitutes sin, if you have become truly converted, a child of\nGod in place of being a transgressor of His law, then there is no one\nwho will be more pleased than myself.\u2014Letter 95, 1893.\n71\n72 Selected Messages Book 3\nTruthfulness of Testimonies Publicly Acknowledged \u2014I\nspoke to the people [in Bloomfield, California] in the forenoon\nin regard to the necessity of having the defects in their characters\nremoved, that they may stand before the Son of God blameless when\nHe shall appear. There was deep feeling in the meeting. I addressed\nseveral personally, pointing out the wrongs I had been shown in their\ncases. They all responded and many with weeping confessed their\nsins and the truthfulness of the testimony.\u2014Letter 7, 1873.\nInterpreted in Light of Preconceived Positions \u2014There are\nmany who interpret that which I write in the light of their own\npreconceived opinions. You know what this means. A division in\nunderstanding and diverse opinions is the sure result.\nHow to write in a way to be understood by those to whom I\naddress important matter, is a problem I cannot solve. But I will\nendeavor to write much less. Owing to the influence of mind upon\nmind, those who misunderstand can lead others to misunderstand,\nby the interpretation they place upon the subjects from my pen. One\nunderstands them as he thinks they should be, in accordance with[80]\nhis ideas. Another puts his construction upon the written matter, and\nconfusion is the sure result.\u2014Letter 96, 1899.\nPartial Acceptance\u2014For many months, excepting for a few\nnights, I have not been able to sleep past one o\u2019clock. I find myself\nsitting in conversation with you, and others, pleading with you as a\nmother would plead with her son....\nYou are doubtless surprised, as I expected you would be, that I\nwrite to you in so plain and decided a manner. But this I must do,\nfor I am made a steward of the grace of Christ, and I must do this\nerrand for the Lord. You may feel well satisfied with yourself. You\nmay deny the representation given me of your case. Some are doing\nthis today....\nThis is the reason that men and women do not always see their\nerrors and mistakes, even when these are pointed out to them. They\nclaim to believe the testimonies that come to them, until the message\ncomes that they must change their plans and methods, that their\ncharacter-building must be altogether different, else the storm and\ntempest will sweep it from its foundation. Then the enemy tempts\nthem to justify themselves.\nReception of the Messages 73\nAfter reading this message, you will doubtless be tempted to\nsay, \u201cThis is not so. I am not as I am represented here. Someone\nhas filled Sister White\u2019s mind with a mass of trash about me.\u201d But I\ntell you in the name of the Lord that the words of this writing are\nfrom God. If you choose thus to dispose of the matter, you show\nthe measure of your faith in the work that the Lord has given His\nservant to do.\u2014Letter 13, 1902.\nThe Portions Condemning Favorite Indulgences\u2014There are\nsome professed believers who accept certain portions of the tes-\ntimonies as the message of God, while they reject those portions\nwhich condemn their favorite indulgences. Such persons are work-\ning contrary to their own welfare and the welfare of the church. [81]\nIt is essential that we walk in the light while we have the light.\u2014\nManuscript 71, 1908.\nTrifling With the Messages \u2014Frequently I do not anticipate\nsaying the things I do say when I am speaking before the people.\nGod may give me words of reproof, of warning, or encouragement\nas he sees fit, for the benefit of souls. I shall speak these words, and\nthey may cut across the track of my brethren, whom I sincerely love\nand respect in the truth.\nI expect to have these words distorted, misapprehended by unbe-\nlievers, and it is no surprise to me. But to have my brethren, who are\nacquainted with my mission and my work, trifle with the message\nthat God gives me to bear, grieves His Spirit.\nIt is discouraging to me to have them pick out portions in the\ntestimonies that please them which they construe to justify their\nown course of action and give the impression that that portion they\naccept as the voice of God, and then when other testimonies come\nthat bring rebuke upon their course, when words are spoken that\ndo not coincide with their opinions and judgment, they dishonor\nGod\u2019s work by saying, \u201cOh, this we do not accept\u2014it is only Sister\nWhite\u2019s opinion, and it is no better than my opinion or that of anyone\nelse.\u201d\u2014Letter 3, 1889.\nWatching for Words on Which Human Interpretation Is\nPlaced\u2014I am sensible of the fact that I am mortal, and that I must\nguard my physical, mental, and moral powers. The constant chang-\ning from place to place necessitated by travel, and the taking hold of\npublic labor wherever I have gone, have been too much for me, in\n74 Selected Messages Book 3\naddition to the writings that I have been preparing day and night as\nthe Lord has worked my mind by His Holy Spirit.\nAnd when I am meeting with evidences that these communica-\ntions will be treated by some in accordance with the human judgment\nof those who shall receive them, when I realize that some are watch-\ning keenly for some words which have been traced by my pen and\nupon which they can place their human interpretations in order to[82]\nsustain their positions and to justify a wrong course of action\u2014when\nI think of these things, it is not very encouraging to continue writing.\nSome of these who are certainly reproved, strive to make every\nword vindicate their own statements. The twistings and connivings\nand misrepresentations and misapplications of the Word are mar-\nvelous! Persons are linked together in this work. What one does not\nthink of, another mind supplies.\u2014Letter 172, 1906.\nWresting the Scriptures and the Testimonies \u2014The lessons\nof Christ were often misunderstood, not because He did not make\nthem plain, but because the minds of the Jews, like the minds of\nmany who claim to believe in this day, were filled with prejudice.\nBecause Christ did not take sides with the Scribes and Pharisees,\nthey hated Him, opposed Him, sought to counteract His efforts, and\nto make His words of no effect.\nWhy will not men see and live the truth? Many study the Scrip-\ntures for the purpose of proving their own ideas to be correct. They\nchange the meaning of God\u2019s Word to suit their own opinions. And\nthus they do also with the testimonies that he sends. They quote half\na sentence, leaving out the other half, which, if quoted, would show\ntheir reasoning to be false. God has a controversy with those who\nwrest the Scriptures, making them conform to their preconceived\nideas.\u2014Manuscript 22, 1890.\nWords Wrested and Misunderstood\u2014It seems impossible for\nme to be understood by those who have had the light but have not\nwalked in it. What I might say in private conversations would be so\nrepeated as to make it mean exactly opposite to what it would have\nmeant had the hearers been sanctified in mind and spirit. I am afraid\nto speak even to my friends; for afterwards I hear, Sister White said\nthis, or Sister White said that.\nMy words are so wrested and misinterpreted that I am coming\nto the conclusion that the Lord desires me to keep out of large\nReception of the Messages 75\nassemblies and refuse private interviews. What I say is reported in [83]\nsuch a perverted light that it is new and strange to me. It is mixed\nwith words spoken by men to sustain their own theories.\u2014Letter\n139, 1900.\nFrom the First a Voice in Our Midst \u2014We call upon you to\ntake your stand on the Lord\u2019s side, and act your part as a loyal\nsubject of the kingdom. Acknowledge the gift that has been placed\nin the church for the guidance of God\u2019s people in the closing days of\nearth\u2019s history. From the beginning the church of God has had the\ngift of prophecy in her midst as a living voice to counsel, admonish,\nand instruct.\nWe have now come to the last days of the work of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, when Satan will work with increasing power because he\nknows that his time is short. At the same time there will come to us\nthrough the gifts of the Holy Spirit, diversities of operations in the\noutpouring of the Spirit. This is the time of the latter rain.\u2014Letter\n230, 1908.\nThe Protective Barrier Torn Away \u2014The enemy has made\nhis masterly efforts to unsettle the faith of our own people in the\nTestimonies, and when these errors come in they claim to prove\nall the positions by the Bible, but they misinterpret the Scriptures.\nThey make bold assertions, as did Elder Canright, and misapply the\nprophecies and the Scriptures to prove falsehood. And, after men\nhave done their work in weakening the confidence of our churches\nin the Testimonies, they have torn away the barrier, that unbelief in\nthe truth shall become widespread, and there is no voice to be lifted\nup to stay the force of error.\nThis is just as Satan designed it should be, and those who have\nbeen preparing the way for the people to pay no heed to the warnings\nand reproofs of the Testimonies of the Spirit of God will see that\na tide of errors of all kinds will spring into life. They will claim\nScripture as their evidence, and deceptions of Satan in every form\nwill prevail.\u2014Letter 109, 1890.\nSecure From Satan\u2019s Seductive Delusions\u2014Men may get up [84]\nscheme after scheme, and the enemy will seek to seduce souls from\nthe truth, but all who believe that the Lord has spoken through Sister\nWhite, and has given her a message, will be safe from the many\ndelusions that will come in these last days.\u2014Letter 50, 1906.\n76 Selected Messages Book 3\nIt Is Not I Whom You Betray, but the Lord\u2014I have tried to\ndo my duty to you and to the Lord Jesus, whom I serve and whose\ncause I love. The testimonies I have borne you have in truth been\npresented to me by the Lord. I am sorry that you have rejected the\nlight given....\nAre you betraying your Lord because in His great mercy He has\nshown you just where you are standing spiritually? He knows every\npurpose of the heart. Nothing is hid from Him. It is not I whom you\nare betraying. It is not I against whom you are so embittered. It is\nthe Lord, who has given me a message to bear to you.\u2014Letter 66,\n1897.\nGiving Up Faith in the Testimonies \u2014One thing is certain:\nThose Seventh-day Adventists who take their stand under Satan\u2019s\nbanner will first give up their faith in the warnings and reproofs\ncontained in the Testimonies of God\u2019s Spirit.\nThe call to great consecration and holier service is being made,\nand will continue to be made.\u2014Letter 156, 1903.\nTwo Typical Examples\n1. Personal Testimony Gratefully Received\u2014We returned De-\ncember 12 [1892]. On the evening of the next day, Brother Faulkhead\ncalled to see me. [See Selected Messages 2:125-140, for the message\ngiven to N. D. Faulkhead.] The burden of his case was upon my\nmind. I told him that I had a message for him and his wife, which I\nhad several times prepared to send them, but I had felt forbidden by\nthe Spirit of the Lord to do so. I asked him to appoint a time when I[85]\ncould see them.\nHe answered. \u201cI am glad that you did not send me a written\ncommunication; I would rather have the message from your lips;\nhad it come in another way I do not think it would have done me\nany good.\u201d he then asked, \u201cWhy not give me the message now?\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cCan you remain to hear it?\u201d he replied that he would do so.\nI was very weary, for I had attended the closing exercises of the\nschool that day; but I now arose from the bed where I was lying and\nread to him for three hours. His heart was softened, tears were in\nhis eyes, and when I ceased reading, he said, \u201cI accept every word;\nall of it belongs to me.\u201d\nReception of the Messages 77\nMuch of the matter I had read related to the [Australian] Echo\nOffice and its management from the beginning. The Lord also re-\nvealed to me Brother Faulkhead\u2019s connection with the Free Masons,\nand I plainly stated that unless he severed every tie that bound him\nto these associations he would lose his soul.\nHe said, \u201cI accept the light the Lord has sent me through you.\nI will act upon it. I am a member of five lodges, and three other\nlodges are under my control. I transact all of their business. Now I\nshall attend no more of their meetings, and shall close my business\nrelations with them as fast as possible.\u201d\nI repeated to him the words spoken by my guide in reference to\nthese associations. Giving a certain movement that was made by\nmy guide, I said, \u201cI cannot relate all that was given to me.\u201d Brother\nFaulkhead told Elder Daniells and others that I gave the particular\nsign known only by the highest order of Masons, which he had just\nentered. He said that I did not know the sign, and that I was not\naware that I was giving the sign to him. This was special evidence to\nhim that the Lord was working through me to save his soul.\u2014Letter\n46, 1892.\n2. A Brother and the Visitor on the Campground \u2014I took\nsome of our brethren aside in our tent [at the Milton, Washington,\ncamp meeting] and read the matter I had written three years ago in\nregard to their course. They had pledged to the General Conference [86]\nand taken it all back again. I read to them straight, clear, and pointed\ntestimonies, but here was the trouble\u2014they had felt no obligations to\nbelieve the Testimonies. Brother L had been one of the Marion Party\n[An offshoot movement that sprang up in Marion, Iowa, in the mid-\n1860\u2019s.] when he lived in LaPort, Iowa, and what to do with these\nfolks was a mystery. There was no minister or his message which\nthey respected above their own judgment. How to bring anything to\nbear upon them was the question. We could only pray, and work for\nthem as though they did believe every word of testimony, and yet be\nso cautious, as though they were unbelievers....\nEarly Sabbath morning [June 7, 1884] I went into meeting and\nthe Lord gave me a testimony directly to them, all unexpected to\nme. I poured it out upon them, showing them that the Lord sent His\nministers with a message and the message they brought was the very\n78 Selected Messages Book 3\nmeans God had ordained to reach them, but they felt at liberty to\npick it in pieces and make of none effect the Word of God....\nSabbath, June 14 We had meetings long to be remembered.\nSabbath forenoon Brother [J. N.] Loughborough talked. I talked\nin the afternoon. The Lord helped me. I then called them forward.\nThirty-five responded. They were mostly young men and women,\nand old men and women. We had a most precious meeting. Some\nwho had left the truth came back with repentance and confession.\nMany were starting for the first time. The Lord was there Himself.\nThis seemed to break down the prejudice and melting testimonies\nwere borne. We had a recess, and then began again, and the good\nwork went on....\nFriday afternoon I read important matter written three years ago.\nThis was acknowledged to be of God. The testimonies were accepted\nheartily and confessions made of great value to the wrongdoer.\u2014\nLetter 19, 1884.\nSection 3\u2014The Preparation of the Ellen G. [87]\nWhite Books\nIntroduction[88]\nMuch of Ellen White\u2019s life was spent preparing books that car-\nried the messages God gave her for His people and in some instances\nto the general public. The White Estate files contain relatively few of\nher statements concerning the details of this work. However, others\nworking with her wrote more fully. Her relatively few statements,\nhowever, do take us into the very heart of her work. We present\nhere some of these statements relative to the preparation and pub-\nlication of the Testimonies for the Churchand certain of her books\nthat present the conflict of the ages story, particularly The Great\nControversy and The Desire of Ages.\nSince the initial writings on various components of the conflict\nof the ages story were enlarged two or three times, it is not possible\nto present a precise chronological sequence of Ellen White\u2019s work\ndepicting the events of the agelong controversy. it should also be\nnoted that Ellen White considered all parts of this narrative as part of\nthe great controversy story, whether Old Testament, New Testament,\nor post-Biblical history.\nStatements explaining the work of her literary assistants are\nincluded, constituting the opening chapter of this section. Another\nchapter traces her work in writing on the life of Christ, in which\nshe was assisted by her niece in 1876 and by Marian Davis in the\n1890\u2019s.\nEllen White\u2019s son William was closely associated with her in\nthe production of her books after 1881, the year James White died.\nOn several occasions he wrote from his intimate knowledge of his\nmother\u2019s work in book preparation. Several enlightening statements\nfrom his pen, as well as from the pen of Marian Davis, appear as\nappendix items.\nWhite Trustees.\n80\nChapter 12\u2014Literary Assistants in Work of Ellen [89]\nG. White\nJames White and Others Assisted\u2014While my husband lived,\nhe acted as a helper and counselor in the sending out of the messages\nthat were given to me. We traveled extensively. Sometimes light\nwould be given to me in the night season, sometimes in the daytime\nbefore large congregations. The instruction I received in vision was\nfaithfully written out by me, as I had time and strength for the work.\nAfterward we examined the matter together, my husband correcting\ngrammatical errors and eliminating needless repetition. Then it was\ncarefully copied for the persons addressed, or for the printer.\nAs the work grew, others assisted me in the preparation of matter\nfor publication. After my husband\u2019s death, faithful helpers joined\nme, who labored untiringly in the work of copying the testimonies\nand preparing articles for publication.\nBut the reports that are circulated, that any of my helpers are\npermitted to add matter or change the meaning of the messages I\nwrite out, are not true.\u2014Letter 225, 1906, published in 1913 in\nWriting and Sending Out of the Testimonies for the Church , p. 4.\n(Selected Messages 1:50.)\nE. G. White Feeling of Inadequacy in 1873 \u2014 This morning [90]\nI take into candid consideration my writings. My husband is too\nfeeble to help me prepare them for the printer, therefore I shall do no\nmore with them at present. I am not a scholar. I cannot prepare my\nown writings for the press. Until I can do this I shall write no more.\nIt is not my duty to tax others with my manuscript.\u2014Manuscript 3,\n1873 (Diary January 10, 1873.)\nDetermined to Develop Her Literary Skills\u2014We rested well\nlast night. This Sabbath morning opens cloudy. My mind is coming\nto strange conclusions. I am thinking I must lay aside my writing\nI have taken so much pleasure in, and see if I cannot become a\nscholar. I am not a grammarian. I will try, if the Lord will help me,\nat forty-five years old to become a scholar in the science. God will\n81\n82 Selected Messages Book 3\nhelp me. I believe He will.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1873 (Diary January 11,\n1873.)\nSense of Inadequacy in 1894\u2014Now I must leave this subject\nso imperfectly presented that I fear you will misinterpret that which\nI feel so anxious to make plain. Oh, that God would quicken the\nunderstanding, for I am but a poor writer, and cannot with pen or\nvoice express the great and deep mysteries of God. Oh, pray for\nyourselves, pray for me.\u2014Letter 67, 1894.\nRefuting Reports of Changes in the Writings \u2014My copyists\nyou have seen. They do not change my language. It stands as I write\nit....\nMy work has been in the field since 1845. Ever since then I have\nlabored with pen and voice. Increased light has come to me as I\nhave imparted the light given me. I have very much more light on\nthe Old and New Testament Scriptures, which I shall present to our\npeople.\u2014Letter 61a, 1900.\nFinal Reading of All Writings Published and Unpublished\u2014\nI am still as active as ever. I am not in the least decrepit. I am able\nto do much work, writing and speaking as I did years ago.\nI read over all that is copied, to see that everything is as it should\nbe. I read all the book manuscript before it is sent to the printer. So\nyou can see that my time must be fully occupied. Besides writing,[91]\nI am called upon to speak to the different churches and to attend\nimportant meetings. I could not do this work unless the Lord helped\nme.\u2014Letter 133, 1902.\nThe Work of Marian Davis\nMiss Davis a Faithful Assistant \u2014Marian had been with me\nabout twenty-five years. She was my chief worker in arranging the\nmatter for my books. She ever appreciated the writings as sacred\nmatter placed in her hands, and would often relate to me what com-\nfort and blessing she received in performing this work, that it was\nher health and her life to do this work. She ever handled the matters\nplaced in her hands as sacred. I shall miss her so much. Who will\nfill her place?\u2014Manuscript 146, 1904.\nMarian Is My Bookmaker\u2014Marian\u2019s work is of a different or-\nder altogether. She is my bookmaker. Fanny [Bolton] [Fanny Bolton,\nLiterary Assistants in Work of Ellen G. White 83\na newspaper writer, after becoming a Seventh-day Adventist, was\ndrawn into Ellen White\u2019s literary work and soon after accompanied\nher to Australia.] never was my bookmaker. How are my books\nmade? Marian does not put in her claim for recognition.\nShe does her work in this way: She takes my articles which\nare published in the papers, and pastes them in blank books. She\nalso has a copy of all the letters I write. In preparing a chapter for\na book, Marian remembers that I have written something on that\nspecial point, which may make the matter more forcible. She begins\nto search for this, and if when she finds it, she sees that it will make\nthe chapter more clear, she adds it.\nThe books are not Marian\u2019s productions, but my own, gathered\nfrom all my writings. Marian has a large field from which to draw,\nand her ability to arrange the matter is of great value to me. It saves\nmy poring over a mass of matter, which I have no time to do.\nSo you understand that Marian is a most valuable help to me in\nbringing out my books. Fanny had none of this work to do. Marian [92]\nhas read chapters to her, and Fanny has sometimes made suggestions\nas to the arrangement of the matter.\nThis is the difference between the workers. As I have stated,\nFanny has been strictly forbidden to change my words for her words.\nAs spoken by the heavenly agencies, the words are severe in their\nsimplicity; and I try to put the thoughts into such simple language\nthat a child can understand every word uttered. The words of some-\none else would not rightly represent me.\nI have written thus fully in order that you may understand the\nmatter. Fanny may claim that she has made my books, but she has\nnot done so. This has been Marian\u2019s field, and her work is far in\nadvance of any work Fanny has done for me.\u2014Letter 61a, 1900.\nMarian\u2019s Caution While Working on Patriarchs and\nProphets in 1889\u2014Willie [W. C. White] [William C. White, son of\nEllen White, at the time serving as acting president of the General\nConference.] is in meeting early and late, devising, planning for the\ndoing of better and more efficient work in the cause of God. We see\nhim only at the table.\nMarian will go to him for some little matters that it seems she\ncould settle for herself. She is nervous and hurried and he so worn\nhe has to just shut his teeth together and hold his nerves as best he\n84 Selected Messages Book 3\ncan. I have had a talk with her and told her she must settle many\nthings herself that she has been bringing Willie.\nHer mind is on every point and the connections, and his mind\nhas been plowing through a variety of difficult subjects until his\nbrain reels and then his mind is in no way prepared to take up these\nlittle minutiae. She must just carry some of these things that belong\nto her part of the work, and not bring them before him nor worry\nhis mind with them. Sometimes I think she will kill us both, all\nunnecessarily, with her little things she can just as well settle herself\nas to bring them before us. Every little change of a word she wants [93]\nus to see.\u2014Letter 64a, 1889.\nHer Faithful Services Greatly Prized\u2014I feel very thankful for\nthe help of Sister Marian Davis in getting out my books. She gathers\nmaterials from my diaries, from my letters, and from the articles\npublished in the papers. I greatly prize her faithful service. She\nhas been with me for twenty-five years, and has constantly been\ngaining increasing ability for the work of classifying and grouping\nmy writings.\u2014Letter 9, 1903.\nWe Worked Together, Just Worked Together\u2014Marian, my\nhelper, faithful and true as the compass to the pole in her work,\nis dying. [This was written September 24, 1904. Marian Davis\ndied October 25, 1904, and was buried at St. Helena, California.\u2014\nCompilers.]...\nI am leaving tomorrow for Battle Creek. Yet my soul is drawn\nto the dying girl who has served me for the last twenty-five years.\nWe have stood side by side in the work, and in perfect harmony\nin that work. And when she would be gathering up the precious\njots and tittles that had come in papers and books and present it to\nme, \u201cNow,\u201d she would say, \u201cthere is something wanted [needed]. I\ncannot supply it.\u201d I would look it over, and in one moment I could\ntrace the line right out.\nWe worked together, just worked together in perfect harmony all\nthe time. She is dying. And it is devotion to the work. She takes the\nintensity of it as though it were a reality, and we both have entered\ninto it with an intensity to have every paragraph that shall stand in\nits right place, and show its right work.\u2014Manuscript 95, 1904.\nChapter 13\u2014The Testimonies for the Church [94]\n1855 Vision Published in First Testimony. [The publication of\nthe November 20, 1855, vision and the May 27, 1856, vision in 16-\npage pamphlets titled \u201cTestimony for the Church,\u201d was initiated by\neyewitnesses in the Battle Creek church, as noted in each pamphlet:\n\u201cWe the undersigned, being eyewitnesses when the above vision\nwas given, deem it highly necessary that it should be published, for\nthe benefit of the church, on account of the important truths and\nwarnings which it contains.

I shall be happy to hear from those who may re-\nceive it.

The first edition of most of these pamphlets being\nexhausted, and there being an increasing demand for them, it has\nbeen thought best to re-print them, as given in the following pages,\nomitting local and personal matters, and giving those portions only\nwhich are of practical and general interest and importance. Most of\nTestimony No. 4 may be found in the second volume of Spiritual\nGifts, hence, it is omitted in this volume. [By popular demand the\nfirst ten were reprinted, in 1874, in full in book form, together with\na reprinting of Numbers 11-20.\u2014Compilers.]\u2014Spiritual Gifts 4a:2.\nPersonal Testimonies Published\u2014Since the warning and in-\nstruction given in testimony for individual cases applied with equal\nforce to many others who had not been specially pointed out in this\nmanner, it seemed to be my duty to publish the personal testimonies\nfor the benefit of the church....\nI know of no better way to present my views of general dangers\nand errors, and the duty of all who love God and keep His command-\nments than by giving these testimonies. Perhaps there is no more\ndirect and forcible way of presenting what the Lord has shown me.\nIn a vision given me June 12, 1868, I was shown that which fully\njustified my course in publishing personal testimonies: \u201cWhen the\nLord singles out individual cases, and specifies their wrongs, others,\nwho have not been shown in vision, frequently take it for granted\nthat they are right, or nearly so. If one is reproved for a special\nwrong, brethren and sisters should carefully examine themselves to\nsee wherein they have failed, and wherein they have been guilty of\nthe same sin.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church 5:658, 659.\nEditing the Published Testimonies in 1884 \u2014Dear Brother[96]\nSmith: I have today mailed you a letter, but information has been\nreceived from Battle Creek that the work upon Testimonies is not\naccepted. [Reference is to the work being done in response to the\nGeneral Conference session action of November 16, which reads:\n\u201c32. Whereas, Some of the bound volumes of the Testimonies to\nthe Church, are out of print, so that full sets cannot be obtained at\nthe office; and,\n\u201cWhereas, There is a constant and urgent call for the reprinting\nof these volumes; therefore,\n\u201cResolved, That we recommend their republication in such a\nform as to make four volumes of seven or eight hundred pages each.\nTestimonies for the Church 87\n\u201c33. Whereas, many of these testimonies were written under the\nmost unfavorable circumstances, the writer being too heavily pressed\nwith anxiety and labor to devote critical thought to the grammatical\nperfection of the writings, and they were printed in such haste as to\nallow these imperfections to pass uncorrected; and,\n\u201cWhereas, we believe the light given by God to his servants is\nby the enlightenment of the mind, thus imparting the thoughts, and\nnot (except in rare cases) the very words in which the ideas should\nbe expressed; therefore,\n\u201cResolved, that in the republication of these volumes, such verbal\nchanges be made as to remove the above-named imperfections, as\nfar as possible, without in any measure changing the thought; and\nfurther,\n\u201c34. Resolved, That this body appoint a committee of five to take\ncharge of the republication of these volumes according to the above\npreambles and resolutions.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, November\n27, 1883.\n\u201cThe committee of five to take charge of the republication of\nthe testimonies provided for in the thirty-fourth resolution was an-\nnounced as follows, the Chair having been empowered to select four\npersons besides himself for this purpose: W.

Butler.\u201d\u2014Ibid.\nThe work was submitted to Ellen White and was approved by her.\nThe letter to Elder Smith intimates that she was more ready to accept\nthe improvements than some in Battle Creek. The product was our\npresent Testimonies, vols. 1-4, published in 1885.\u2014Compilers.]\nI wish to state some matters, which you can do what you please\nwith. These statements you have heard me make before\u2014that I was\nshown years ago that we should not delay publishing the important\nlight given me because I could not prepare the matter perfectly. My\nhusband was at times very sick, unable to give me the help that I\nshould have had and that he could have given me had he been in\nhealth. On this account I delayed putting before the people that\nwhich has been given me in vision.\nBut I was shown that I should present before the people in the [97]\nbest manner possible the light received; then as I received greater\nlight, and as I used the talent God had given me, I should have\nincreased ability to use in writing and in speaking. I was to improve\n88 Selected Messages Book 3\neverything, as far as possible bringing it to perfection, that it might\nbe accepted by intelligent minds.\nAs far as possible every defect should be removed from all our\npublications. As the truth should unfold and become widespread,\nevery care should be exercised to perfect the works published.\nI saw in regard to Brother Andrews\u2019 history of the Sabbath, that\nhe delayed the work too long. Other erroneous works were taking\nthe field and blocking the way, so that minds would be prejudiced\nby the opposing elements. I saw that thus much would be lost. After\nthe first edition was exhausted, then he could make improvements;\nbut he was seeking too hard to arrive at perfection. This delay was\nnot as God would have it.\nEllen G. White Desired Language Correctly Used\nNow, Brother Smith, I have been making a careful, critical exam-\nination of the work that has been done on the Testimonies, and I see\na few things that I think should be corrected in the matter brought\nbefore you and others at the General Conference [November, 1883].\nBut as I examine the matter more carefully I see less and less that\nis objectionable. Where the language used is not the best, I want it\nmade correct and grammatical, as I believe it should be in every case\nwhere it can be without destroying the sense. This work is delayed,\nwhich does not please me....\nMy mind has been exercised upon the question of theTestimonies\nthat have been revised. We have looked them over more critically. I\ncannot see the matter as my brethren see it. I think the changes will\nimprove the book. If our enemies handle it, let them do so....\nI think that anything that shall go forth will be criticized, twisted,\nturned, and boggled, but we are to go forward with a clear con-\nscience, doing what we can and leaving the result with God. We[98]\nmust not be long in delaying the work.\nNow, my brethren, what do you propose to do? I do not want\nthis work dragging along any longer. I want something done, and\ndone now.\u2014Letter 11, 1884 (Written from Healdsburg, California,\nFebruary 19, 1884.)\nThe Work of E. G.

I have to read them myself; for the sound of the voice\nin reading or singing is almost unendurable to me.\nI try to bring out general principles, and if I see a sentence which\nI fear would give someone excuse to injure someone else, I feel\nat perfect liberty to keep back the sentence, even though it is all\nperfectly true.\u2014Letter 32, 1901.\nLetters to Help Others\nAnticipated Use of Letters\u2014I am endeavoring by the help of\nGod to write letters that will be a help not merely to those to whom\nthey are addressed, but to many others who need them.\u2014Letter 79,\n1905.\nChapter 14\u2014Initial Steps in Writing and Publishing[99]\nThe Great Controversy Story\nThe 1858 Great Controversy Vision\nThe Vision March 14, 1858\u2014In this vision at Lovett\u2019s Grove,\n[Elder and Mrs. White, who resided in Battle Creek, Michigan, were\nholding meetings with the believers at Lovett\u2019s Grove, Ohio.

On the arrival of\nthe train at Jackson, we went to Bro. Palmer\u2019s. We had been in the\nhouse but a short time, when, as I was conversing with Sr. P., my\ntongue refused to utter what I wished to say, and seemed large and\nnumb. A strange, cold sensation struck my heart, passed over my[100]\nhead, and down my right side. For a while I was insensible; but was\naroused by the voice of earnest prayer.

I cannot\nsee any light shining to Michigan for me. [On March 22, James\nWhite left Oakland, where they had just built a home, for a special\nsession of the General Conference at Battle Creek, Michigan. He\nand his wife were separated for sixty-six days, until they met again\non May 27 at the Kansas camp meeting. During this period she\nwrote her husband almost every day and occasionally to others.\u2014\nCompilers.] This year I feel that my work is writing. I must be\nsecluded, stay right here, and I must not let inclination or persuasion\nof others shake my resolution to keep closely to my work until it\nis done.

I cannot write but one half of a day each day....\nMary [is] in the office, I upstairs writing.... [104]\nI have had much freedom in prayer and sweet communion with\nGod in my waking hours at night and early in the morning. I am\ngaining some strength, but find that any taxation affects me seriously,\nso that it takes time to recover from it. My trust [is] in God. I have\n93\n94 Selected Messages Book 3\nconfidence that He will help me in my efforts to get out the truth and\nlight He has given me to [give to] His people.\u2014Letter 3, 1876.\nApril 7\u2014The precious subjects open to my mind well. I trust\nin God and He helps me to write. I am some twenty-four pages\nahead of Mary. She does well with my copy. It will take a clear\nsense of duty to call me from this work to camp meetings. I mean to\nfinish my writings on one book, at any rate, before I go anywhere....\nThe East will not see me for one year unless I feel that God calls\nme to go. He has given me my work. I will do it, if I can be left\nfree.\u2014Letter 4, 1876.\nApril 8\u2014I have liberty in writing and I plead with God daily for\ncounsel and that I may be imbued with His Spirit. I then believe that\nI shall have help and strength and grace to do the will of God....\nI never had such an opportunity to write in my life, and I mean\nto make the most of it....\nHow will it do to read my manuscript to Elders [J.

I have a special\nwork at this time to write out the things which the Lord has shown\nme....\nI have a work to do which has been a great burden to my soul.\nHow great, no one but the Lord knows.\nAgain, I want time to have my mind calm and composed. I want[105]\nto have time to meditate and pray while engaged in this work. I\ndo not want to be wearied myself or be closely connected with our\npeople who will divert my mind. This is a great work, and I feel like\ncrying to God every day for His Spirit to help me to do this work all\nright.\u2014Letter 59, 1876 (To Lucinda Hall, April 8, 1876.)\nApril 14\u2014It seems to me my writings are important, and I [am]\nso feeble, so unable to do the work with justice. I have pleaded with\nGod to be imbued with His Holy Spirit, to be connected with heaven,\nRunning Account of Ellen G. White\u2019s Experience in Writing... 95\nthat this work may be done right. I can never do this work without\nthe special blessing of God.\u2014Letter 7, 1876, p. 2.\nApril 16\u2014I have written quite a number of pages today. Mary\nis hard after me.

She\nshowed me today quite a heavy pile of manuscripts she had prepared.\n[All work was at this time in handwritten sheets. Typewriters did\nnot come into Ellen White\u2019s work until 1883, two years after her\nhusband\u2019s death.\u2014Compilers.]...\nI am feeling very free and peaceful. I feel the precious love of\nChrist in my heart. It humbles me in my own sight, while Jesus is\nexalted before me. Oh, how I do long for that social and mysterious\nconnection with Jesus that elevates us above the temporal things\nof life. It is my anxiety to be right with God, to have His Spirit\ncontinually witnessing with me that I am indeed a child of God.\u2014\nLetter 8, 1876.\nApril 18\u2014We went to the city [San Francisco] Sunday night.\nI spoke to quite a large congregation of outsiders with acceptance,\ntaking up the subject of the loaves and fishes with which Jesus, by\nhis miraculous power, fed about ten thousand people ... that were\ncontinually collecting, after the Saviour had blessed the small portion\nof food; Christ walking on the sea, and the Jews requiring a sign\nthat he was the Son of God. The neighbor next to the church near\nthe public garden was there. Cragg, I believe his name is. They all [106]\nlistened with wide-open eyes and some open mouths....\nI would feel pleased to meet my brethren and sisters in camp\nmeeting. It is just such work as I enjoy. Much better than the\nconfinement of writing. But this will break up my work and defeat\nthe plans of getting out my books, for I cannot do both\u2014travel and\nwrite. Now seems to be my golden opportunity. Mary is with me,\nthe best copyist I can ever have. Another such chance may never be\nmine.\u2014Letter 9, 1876.\nApril 21\u2014I have just completed quite a lengthy article on several\nmiracles; makes fifty pages. We have prepared about 150 pages since\nyou left. We feel the best of satisfaction in what we have prepared.\u2014\nLetter 12, 1876.\nApril 24\u2014Mary has just been reading to me two articles\u2014one\non the loaves and fishes, Christ walking on the water, and stating\n96 Selected Messages Book 3\nto His hearers He was the Bread of life, which caused some of His\ndisciples to turn from Him. This takes fifty pages and comprises\nmany subjects. I do think it the most precious matter I have ever\nwritten. Mary is just as enthusiastic over it. She thinks it is of the\nhighest value. I am perfectly satisfied with it.\nThe other article was upon Christ going through the cornfield,\nplucking the ears of corn, and healing the withered hand\u2014twelve\npages. If I can, with Mary\u2019s help, get out these subjects of such\nintense interest, I could say, \u201cLord, now lettest Thou Thy servant\ndepart in peace.\u201d These writings are all I can see now....\nMy heart and mind are in this work, and the Lord will sustain\nme in doing this work. I believe the Lord will give me health. I have\nasked Him, and He will answer my prayer.\nI love the Lord. I love His cause. I love His people. I feel great\npeace and calmness of mind. There seems to be nothing to confuse\nand distract my mind, and with so much hard thinking, my mind\ncould not be perplexed with anything without being overtaxed.\u2014\nLetter 13, 1876.\nApril 25\u2014I cannot merely portion my writing to one half the[107]\nday, as some of the time my head troubles me, and then I have to rest,\nlie down, stop thinking, and take my time for writing when I can\ndo so comfortably. I cannot rush business. This work must be done\ncarefully, slowly, and accurately. The subjects we have prepared are\nwell gotten up. They please me.\u2014Letter 14, 1876.\nApril 27\u2014I have written fifteen pages today. Mary Clough is\nhard after me. She has copied fifteen pages today\u2014a good, large\nday\u2019s work.... Never have I had such an opportunity in my life before.\nI will improve it. We have written about 200 pages since you left,\nall copied, ready for printers....\nI feel that I am less than nothing, but Jesus is my all\u2014my righ-\nteousness, and my wisdom, and my strength.\u2014Letter 16a, 1876.\nMay 5\u2014I have been writing more than usual, which was too\nmuch for me. I cannot and must not write more than half a day, but\nI continue to step over the bounds and pay for it. My mind is on my\nsubjects day and night. I have strong confidence in prayer. The Lord\nhears me and I believe in His salvation. In His strength I trust. In\nHis strength I shall complete my writings. I cling firmly to His hand\nwith unwavering confidence....\nRunning Account of Ellen G.

My mind was urged to this by the Spirit of God.\nThe view I had sixteen years ago was forcefully impressed on my\nmind. I saw that important matter was to be seen applicable to the\npeople of God. This was in reference to testimony God had given\nme to bear in reproving wrong.\u2014Letter 21, 1876.\nMay 11\u2014If I get my writings [Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2] all in\nmanuscript, my part of the work is done and I shall be relieved.\u2014\nLetter 24, 1876.\nOctober 19\u2014We have decided to have the printers [at the Re-\nview and Herald office in Battle Creek] go on my book and not\ntransport these books across the plains again.

From time to time I have been permitted\nto behold the working, in different ages, of the great controversy\nbetween Christ, the Prince of life, the Author of our salvation, and\nSatan, the prince of evil, the author of sin, the first transgressor of\nGod\u2019s holy law.\u2014The Great Controversy, Introduction, p. x.\nVisions of the Past and Future While Writing \u2014When I am\nusing my pen, wonderful representations are given me of past,\npresent, and future.\u2014Letter 86, 1906.\nReformation History Presented in Vision\u2014The banner of the\nruler of the synagogue of Satan was lifted high, and error apparently\nmarched in triumph, and the reformers, through the grace given them\nof God, waged a successful warfare against the hosts of darkness.\nEvents in the history of the reformers have been presented before\nme.

And as God spoke the day\n102 Selected Messages Book 3\nand hour of Jesus\u2019 coming, and delivered the everlasting covenant to\nHis people, He spoke one sentence and then paused while the words\nwere rolling through the earth....\nI have not the slightest knowledge as to the time spoken by the\nvoice of God.

I knew\nthat time was short, that the scenes which are soon to crowd upon us\nwould at the last come very suddenly and swiftly, as represented in\nthe words of Scripture: \u201cThe day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in\nthe night\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:2).\nThe Lord has set before me matters which are of urgent impor-\ntance for the present time, and which reach into the future. The\nwords have been spoken in a charge to me, \u201cWrite in a book the\nthings which thou hast seen and heard, and let it go to all people;\nfor the time is at hand when past history will be repeated.\u201d I have\nExpanding the Great Controversy Presentation 103\nbeen aroused at one, two, or three o\u2019clock in the morning, with some\npoint forcibly impressed upon my mind, as if spoken by the voice of\nGod. I was shown that many of our own people were asleep in their\nsins, and although they claimed to be Christians, they would perish\nunless they were converted.\nThe solemn impressions made upon my mind as the truth was\nlaid out in clear lines before me, I tried to bring before others, that\neach might feel the necessity of having a religious experience for [114]\nhimself, of having a knowledge of the Saviour for himself, of seeking\nrepentance, faith, love, hope, and holiness for himself.\nI was assured that there was no time to lose. The appeals and\nwarnings must be given; our churches must be aroused, must be\ninstructed, that they may give the warning to all whom they can\npossibly reach, declaring that the sword is coming, that the Lord\u2019s\nanger upon a profligate world will not long be deferred. I was\nshown that many would listen to the warning. Their minds would be\nprepared to discern the very things that it pointed out to them.\nI was shown that much of my time had been occupied in speaking\nto the people, when it was more essential that I should devote myself\nto writing out the important matters for V olume IV , [To Ellen White\nthe 1888 edition ofThe Great Controversywas still V olume IV in the\npresentation of the great controversy story, and was often referred to\nby her as such.\u2014Compilers.] that the warning must go where the\nliving messenger could not go, and that it would call the attention of\nmany to the important events to occur in the closing scenes of this\nworld\u2019s history.\nAs the condition of the church and the world was opened before\nme, and I beheld the fearful scenes that lie just before us, I was\nalarmed at the outlook; and night after night, while all in the house\nwere sleeping, I wrote out the things given me of God. I was shown\nthe heresies which are to arise, the delusions that will prevail, the\nmiracle-working power of Satan\u2014the false Christs that will appear\u2014\nthat will deceive the greater part even of the religious world, and\nthat would, if it were possible, draw away even the elect.\nIs this work of the Lord? I know that it is, and our people also\nprofess to believe it. The warning and instruction of this book are\nneeded by all who profess to believe the present truth.\u2014Letter 1,\n1890.\nChapter 17\u2014The Experience of E. G.

I lie awake nights pleading with the Lord for the Holy\nSpirit to come upon me, to abide upon me....\nI walk with trembling before God. I know not how to speak\nor trace with pen the large subject of the atoning sacrifice. I know\nnot how to present subjects in the living power in which they stand\nbefore me. I tremble for fear lest I shall belittle the great plan of\nsalvation by cheap words.

The building [of] a tower, the war of Kings, these things\ndo not burden my mind, but the subjects of the life of Christ, His\ncharacter representing the Father, the parables essential for us all to\nunderstand and practice the lessons contained in them, I shall dwell\nupon.\u2014Letter 131, 1893.\n104\nExperience of E.

I find but little time in which to write on the life of Christ. I\nam continually receiving letters that demand an answer, and I dare\nnot neglect important matters that are brought to my notice. Then\nthere are churches to visit, private testimonies to write, and many\nother things to be attended to that tax me and consume my time.\nMarian greedily grasps every letter I write to others in order to find\nsentences that she can use in the life of Christ. She has been collect-\ning everything that has a bearing on Christ\u2019s lessons to his disciples,\nfrom all possible sources. After the camp meeting is ended, which is\na very important meeting, I shall locate myself in some place where\nI can give myself to the work of writing on the life of Christ....\nThere is much to be done in the churches, and I cannot act my\npart in keeping up the interest and do the other work that is necessary\n106 Selected Messages Book 3\nfor me to do without becoming so weary that I cannot devote strength\nto writing on the life of Christ. I am much perplexed as to what is\nmy duty....\nI have about decided to ... devote all my time to writing for the\nbooks that ought to be prepared without further delay. I would like\nto write on the life of Christ, on Christian Temperance [Ministry of\nHealing], and prepare Testimony No. 34 [volume 6] for it is very\nmuch needed. I will have to stop writing so much for the papers,\nand let the Review and Herald, the Signs of the Times, and all other\nperiodicals go without articles from my pen for this year.\nAll articles that appear under my signature are fresh, new writ-\nings from my pen. I am sorry that I have not more literary help. I\nneed this kind of help very much. Fanny [Bolton] could help me\na great deal on the book work if she had not so many articles to\nprepare for the papers, and so many letters and testimonies to edit\nto meet the demands of my correspondence and the needs of the[118]\npeople.\nIt is of no use to expect anything from Marian [Davis] until the\nlife of Christ is completed. I wish I could procure another intelligent\nworker who could be trusted to prepare matter for the press. Such a\nworker would be of great value to me. But the question is, Where\nshall I find such an one? I am brain weary much of the time. I write\nmany pages before breakfast. I rise in the morning at two, three, and\nfour o\u2019clock....\nYou know that my whole theme both in the pulpit and in private,\nby voice and pen, is the life of Christ. Hitherto nearly all that I have\nwritten on this theme has been written during the hours when others\nare sleeping.\u2014Letter 46a, 1894.\nJune 6, 1896 \u2014That which is holy and elevated in heavenly\nthings, I scarcely dare represent. Often I lay down my pen and say,\nImpossible, impossible for finite minds to grasp eternal truths, and\ndeep holy principles, and to express their living import. I stand\nignorant and helpless. The rich current of thought takes possession\nof my whole being, and I lay down my pen, and say, O Lord, I am\nfinite, I am weak, and simple and ignorant; Thy grand and holy\nrevelations I can never find language to express.\nMy words seem inadequate. I despair of clothing the truth God\nhas made known concerning His great redemption, which engrossed\nExperience of E. G.

The truths that are to last through time and through\neternity, the great plan of redemption, which cost so much for the\nsalvation of the human race, presenting before them a life that mea-\nsures with the life of God\u2014these truths are too full, deep, and holy\nfor human words or human pen to adequately express.\u2014Manuscript\n23, 1896.\nJuly 29, 1897\u2014I awaken at half past two, and offer up my prayer\nto God in the name of Jesus. I am weak in physical strength; my\nhead is not free from pain; my left eye troubles me. In writing upon\nthe life of Christ I am deeply wrought upon. I forget to breathe as I [119]\nshould.

It was sent in piecemeal, for new revelations led to many\nadditions to the manuscript thought to be complete.\u2014Compilers.]\nThis will be handled by the Pacific Press. I have employed workers\nto prepare this book, especially Sister Davis, and this has cost me\nthree thousand dollars. Another three thousand will be needed to\nprepare it to be scattered broadcast through the world in two books.\nWe hope that they will have a large sale. I have devoted little time to\nthese books, for speaking, writing articles for the papers, and writing\nprivate testimonies to meet and repress the evils that are coming in\nkeeps me busy.\u2014Letter 114, 1896.\nMeeting Criticisms of The Desire of Ages\nJune 20, 1900 \u2014I received your letter, Edson. [James Edson\nWhite wrote to his mother on May 11, 1900, presenting criticisms\nof the size, format, price, and illustrations of The Desire of Ages. He\nalso objected to the appendix in the first edition, asking, \u201cWhat is\nthe use of pitching into other people\u2019s beliefs in the way it is done\nin this appendix?\u201d he argued that such material made it difficult\nfor literature evangelists to sell the book.] In regard to The Desire\nof Ages, when you meet with those who have criticisms to make,\n108 Selected Messages Book 3\nas will always be the case, do not take any notice of the supposed\nmistakes, but praise the book, tell of its advantages. The Desire\nof Ages would have been the same size as the two former books\n[Patriarchs and Prophets and The Great Controversy], had it not\nbeen for the strong recommendation of Brother O who was then\ngeneral canvassing agent. What you say about the appendix is the\nfirst objection we have heard regarding that feature. Many have\nspoken of the great help they have found in the appendix. If people\nare prejudiced against anything that makes prominent the Sabbath,[120]\nthat very objection shows the necessity of it being there to convict\nminds.\nLet us be guarded. Let us refuse to allow the criticisms of anyone\nto imprint objections on our minds. Let criticizers live by their trade\nof criticism. They cannot speak in favor of the very best of blessings\nwithout attaching a criticism to cast a shadow of reproach. Let us\neducate ourselves to praise that which is good when others criticize.\nMurmurers will always pick flaws, but let us not be saddened by the\naccusing element. Let us not consider it a virtue to make and suggest\ndifficulties which one mind and another will bring in to harass and\nperplex.\u2014Letter 87, 1900.\nChapter 18\u2014Comments While at Work on the [121]\nConflict Series Books\nThe Result of Visions Spanning Her Lifetime\nI had been, during the forty-five years of experience, shown the\nlives, the character and history of the patriarchs, and prophets, who\nhad come to the people with messages from God, and Satan would\nstart some evil report, or get up some difference of opinion or turn\nthe interest in some other channel, that the people should be deprived\nof the good the Lord had to bestow upon them....\nI could but have a vivid picture in my mind from day to day of\nthe way reformers were treated, how slight difference of opinion\nseemed to create a frenzy of feeling. Thus it was in the betrayal,\ntrial, and crucifixion of Jesus. All this had passed before me point\nby point.\u2014Letter 14, 1889.\nConstructive Criticisms Appreciated (1885)\nTell her [Marian Davis] I have just one minute ago read the\nletters in which she has specified the improvements to be made in\narticles for V olume 1 [Patriarchs and Prophets].

[In the preparation of The Desire of Ages such works were\n109\n110 Selected Messages Book 3\nused in determining the order of events. On this point Marian Davis,\nwriting to the manager of the Pacific Press, stated on November 23,\n1896, \u201cIn the order of chapters we followed Andrews\u2019 harmony as\ngiven in his life of Christ. He is generally regarded as the very best\nauthority, and is quoted by leading writers. We know of no better\narrangement than his.\u201d Samuel J. Andrews, The Life of Our Lord\nUpon the Earth, First published in 1862. The 1891 edition was in\nEllen White\u2019s library.

I wish all to understand\nthat my confidence in the light that God has given stands firm,\nbecause I know that the Holy Spirit\u2019s power magnified the truth, and\nmade it honorable, saying: \u201cThis is the way; walk ye in it.\u201d In my\nbooks, the truth is stated, barricaded by a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nThe Holy Spirit traced these truths upon my heart and mind as\nindelibly as the law was traced by the finger of God upon the tables\nof stone, which are now in the ark, to be brought forth in that great\nday when sentence will be pronounced against every evil, seducing\nscience produced by the father of lies.\u2014Letter 90, 1906 (Colporteur\nMinistry, 126.)\nThe 1911 Revision of The Great Controversy[123]\nThe Author Explains What and Why\n\u2014Sanitarium, Cal., July 25, 1911\nDear Brother [F . M.] Wilcox,\nA few days ago I received a copy of the new edition of the\nbook Great Controversy, recently printed at Mountain View, and\nalso a similar copy printed at Washington. The book pleases me. I\nhave spent many hours looking through its pages, and I see that the\npublishing houses have done good work.\nComments While at Work on the Conflict Series Books 111\nThe book Great Controversy I appreciate above silver or gold,\nand I greatly desire that it shall come before the people. While\nwriting the manuscript of Great Controversy, I was often conscious\nof the presence of the angels of God. And many times the scenes\nabout which I was writing were presented to me anew in visions of\nthe night, so that they were fresh and vivid in my mind.\nRecently it was necessary for this book to be reset, because the\nelectrotype plates were badly worn. It has cost me much to have this\ndone, but I do not complain; for whatever the cost may be, I regard\nthis new edition with great satisfaction.\nYesterday I read what W. C. White has recently written to\ncanvassing agents and responsible men at our publishing houses\nregarding this latest edition of Great Controversy, and I think he has\npresented the matter correctly and well. [See Appendix A for the\nEllen G. White-approved W. C. White statements explaining the in-\nvolvements of revising The Great Controversy in 1911. Appendices\nB and C present his answers to questions relative to the writing of\nthe great controversy story and explaining how the light came to her,\net cetera.\u2014Compilers.]\nWhen I learned that Great Controversy must be reset, I deter-\nmined that we would have everything closely examined, to see if the\ntruths it contained were stated in the very best manner, to convince\nthose not of our faith that the Lord had guided and sustained me in\nthe writing of its pages.\nAs a result of the thorough examination by our most experienced [124]\nworkers, some changing in the wording has been proposed. These\nchanges I have carefully examined, and approved. I am thankful that\nmy life has been spared, and that I have strength and clearness of\nmind for this and other literary work.\nWhile preparing the book on the Acts of the Apostles, the Lord\nhas kept my mind in perfect peace. This book will soon be ready\nfor publication. When this book is ready for publication, if the Lord\nsees fit to let me rest, I shall say Amen, and Amen. If the Lord spares\nmy life, I will continue to write, and to bear my testimony in the\ncongregation of the people, as the Lord shall give me strength and\nguidance....\n(Signed)\n112 Selected Messages Book 3\nEllen G. White\nLetter 56, 1911\nSection 4\u2014The Incarnation [125]\nIntroduction[126]\nThe plan of salvation, of which the incarnation is the very heart,\nis an exhaustless theme into which we may now look, and that will be\nthe prime topic of study through the ceaseless ages of eternity. Again\nand again through the years Ellen White, in sermons preached, in\nletters written, in periodical articles and books, touched feelingly on\nthis sublime topic of God and man becoming one. This is particularly\nso in The Desire of Ages.\nA number of enlightening statements appear in The Youth\u2019s In-\nstructor. Excerpts from many of these and from like materials from\nother sources have already appeared in Selected Messages 1:242-\n289; the 1965 devotional book, \u201cThat I May Know Him\u201d; and Ellen\nG. White releases in The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 5:1126-1131;\nand The S.D.A. Bible Commentary 7A:443-456, the latter being a\nreprint of Appendix B of Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions\non Doctrine.\nYet, from time to time further choice items come to the front\nfrom sources not commonly available. Several of these have been\ndrawn together here to make up this section, \u201cThe Incarnation.\u201d\nAs we review these beautiful, and at times seemingly unfath-\nomable, truths, we are reminded of this Ellen G. White statement:\n\u201cThe incarnation of Christ has ever been, and will ever remain a mys-\ntery.\u201d\u2014Letter 8, 1895 (published in The SDA Bible Commentary,\nvol. 5, p. 1129).\nBut these great truths, as we can grasp them by faith, are for us.\nWhite Trustees.\n114\nChapter 19\u2014The Incarnation [127]\nThe Completeness of Christ\u2019s Humanity\nWe cannot understand how Christ became a little, helpless babe.\nHe could have come to earth in such beauty that He would have\nbeen unlike the sons of men. His face could have been bright with\nlight, and His form could have been tall and beautiful. He could\nhave come in such a way as to charm those who looked upon Him;\nbut this was not the way that God planned He should come among\nthe sons of men.\nHe was to be like those who belonged to the human family and\nto the Jewish race. His features were to be like those of other human\nbeings, and He was not to have such beauty of person as to make\npeople point Him out as different from others. He was to come as\none of the human family, and to stand as a man before heaven and\nearth. He had come to take man\u2019s place, to pledge Himself in man\u2019s\nbehalf, to pay the debt that sinners owed. He was to live a pure\nlife on the earth, and show that Satan had told a falsehood when he\nclaimed that the human family belonged to him forever, and that\nGod could not take men out of his hands.\nMen first beheld Christ as a babe, as a child....\nThe more we think about Christ\u2019s becoming a babe here on earth, [128]\nthe more wonderful it appears. How can it be that the helpless babe\nin Bethlehem\u2019s manger is still the divine Son of God? Though we\ncannot understand it, we can believe that He who made the worlds,\nfor our sakes became a helpless babe. Though higher than any of\nthe angels, though as great as the Father on the throne of heaven,\nHe became one with us. In Him God and man became one, and\nit is in this fact that we find the hope of our fallen race. Looking\nupon Christ in the flesh, we look upon God in humanity, and see in\nHim the brightness of divine glory, the express image of God the\nFather.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, November 21, 1895.\n115\n116 Selected Messages Book 3\nChrist Descended to the Level of Fallen Humanity\nChrist has made an infinite sacrifice. He gave his own life for\nus. He took upon His divine soul the result of the transgression of\nGod\u2019s law. Laying aside His royal crown, He condescended to step\ndown, step by step, to the level of fallen humanity.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, April 30, 1901\nFrom the Jordan, Jesus was led into the wilderness of temptation.\n\u201cAnd when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was after-\nward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If\nthou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread\u201d\n(Matthew 4:2, 3).\nChrist was suffering the keenest pangs of hunger, and this temp-\ntation was a severe one. But He must begin the work of redemption\njust where the ruin began. Adam had failed on the point of appetite,\nand Christ must conquer here. The power that rested upon Him came\ndirectly from the Father, and He must not exercise it in His own\nbehalf. With that long fast there was woven into His experience a\nstrength and power that God alone could give. He met and resisted\nthe enemy in the strength of a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d \u201cMan shall not\nlive by bread alone,\u201d He said, \u201cbut by every word that proceedeth\nout of the mouth of God\u201d (Verse 4).\nThis strength it is the privilege of all the tempted ones of earth[129]\nto have. Christ\u2019s experience is for our benefit. His example in\novercoming appetite points out the way for those to overcome who\nwould be His followers.\nChrist was suffering as the members of the human family suffer\nunder temptation; but it was not the will of God that He should\nexercise His divine power in His own behalf. Had He not stood as\nour representative, Christ\u2019s innocence would have exempted Him\nfrom all this anguish, but it was because of His innocence that He felt\nso keenly the assaults of Satan. All the suffering which is the result\nof sin was poured into the bosom of the sinless Son of God. Satan\nwas bruising the heel of Christ, but every pang endured by Christ,\nevery grief, every disquietude, was fulfilling the great plan of man\u2019s\nredemption. Every blow inflicted by the enemy was rebounding\non himself. Christ was bruising the serpent\u2019s head.\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, December 21, 1899.\nIncarnation 117\nWas Christ Capable of Yielding to Temptation?\nIn your letter in regard to the temptations of Christ, you say: \u201cIf\nHe was One with God He could not fall\u201d....The point you inquire\nof me is, In our Lord\u2019s great scene of conflict in the wilderness,\napparently under the power of Satan and his angels, was He capable,\nin His human nature, of yielding to these temptations?\nI will try to answer this important question: As God He could not\nbe tempted: but as a man He could be tempted, and that strongly, and\ncould yield to the temptations. His human nature must pass through\nthe same test and trial Adam and Eve passed through. His human\nnature was created; it did not even possess the angelic powers. It\nwas human, identical with our own. He was passing over the ground\nwhere Adam fell. He was now where, if He endured the test and trial\nin behalf of the fallen race, He would redeem Adam\u2019s disgraceful\nfailure and fall, in our own humanity.\nChrist Had a Human Body and a Human Mind \u2014A human\nbody and a human mind were His. He was bone of our bone and flesh [130]\nof our flesh. He was subjected to poverty from His first entrance into\nthe world. He was subject to disappointment and trial in His own\nhome, among His own brethren. He was not surrounded, as in the\nheavenly courts, with pure and lovely characters. He was compassed\nwith difficulties. He came into our world to maintain a pure, sinless\ncharacter, and to refute Satan\u2019s lie that it was not possible for human\nbeings to keep the law of God. Christ came to live the law in His\nhuman character in just that way in which all may live the law in\nhuman nature if they will do as Christ was doing. He had inspired\nholy men of old to write for the benefit of man: \u201cLet him take hold\nof my strength, that he may make peace with me; and he shall make\npeace with me\u201d (Isaiah 27:5).\nAbundant provision has been made that finite, fallen man may\nso connect with God that, through the same Source by which Christ\novercame in His human nature, he may stand firmly against every\ntemptation, as did Christ. He was subject to inconveniences that\nhuman nature is subjected to. He breathed the air of the same world\nwe breathe. He stood and traveled in the same world we inhabit,\nwhich, we have positive evidence, was no more friendly to grace\nand righteousness than it is today.\n118 Selected Messages Book 3\nHis Attributes May Be Ours\u2014The higher attributes of His be-\ning it is our privilege to have, if we will, through the provisions He\nhas made, appropriate these blessings and diligently cultivate the\ngood in the place of the evil. We have reason, conscience, mem-\nory, will, affections\u2014all the attributes a human being can possess.\nThrough the provision made when God and the Son of God made\na covenant to rescue man from the bondage of Satan, every facility\nwas provided that human nature should come into union with His\ndivine nature. In such a nature was our Lord tempted. He could have\nyielded to Satan\u2019s lying suggestions as did Adam, but we should\nadore and glorify the Lamb of God that He did not in a single point[131]\nyield one jot or one tittle.\nTwo Natures Blended in Christ\u2014Through being partakers of\nthe divine nature we may stand pure and holy and undefiled. The\nGodhead was not made human, and the human was not deified by\nthe blending together of the two natures. Christ did not possess the\nsame sinful, corrupt, fallen disloyalty we possess, for then He could\nnot be a perfect offering.\u2014Manuscript 94, 1893.\nThe Reality of Christ\u2019s Temptations\u2014When the follower of\nChrist meets with trial and perplexity, he is not to become discour-\naged. He is not to cast away his confidence if he does not realize all\nhis expectations. When buffeted by the enemy, he should remember\nthe Saviour\u2019s life of trial and discouragement. Heavenly beings min-\nistered to Christ in His need, yet this did not make the Saviour\u2019s life\none of freedom from conflict and temptation. He was in all points\ntempted like as we are, yet without sin. If His people will follow this\nexample, they will be imbued with His Spirit, and heavenly angels\nwill minister to them.\nThe temptations to which Christ was subjected were a terrible\nreality. As a free agent He was placed on probation, with liberty to\nyield to Satan\u2019s temptations and work at cross-purposes with God. If\nthis were not so, if it had not been possible for Him to fall, He could\nnot have been tempted in all points as the human family is tempted.\nThe temptations of Christ, and His sufferings under them, were\nproportionate to His exalted, sinless character. But in every time\nof distress, Christ turned to His Father. He \u201cresisted unto blood\u201d\nin that hour when the fear of moral failure was as the fear of death.\nAs He bowed in Gethsemane, in His soul agony, drops of blood fell\nIncarnation 119\nfrom His pores, and moistened the sods of the earth. He prayed\nwith strong crying and tears, and He was heard in that He feared.\nGod strengthened Him, as He will strengthen all who will humble\nthemselves, and throw themselves, soul, body, and spirit, into the\nhands of a covenant-keeping God.\nUpon the cross Christ knew, as no other can know, the awful [132]\npower of Satan\u2019s temptations, and His heart was poured out in pity\nand forgiveness for the dying thief, who had been ensnared by the\nenemy.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, October 26, 1899.\nChrist\u2019s heart was pierced by a far sharper pain than that caused\nby the nails driven into His hands and feet. He was bearing the\nsins of the whole world, enduring our punishment\u2014the wrath of\nGod against transgression. His trial involved the fierce temptation\nof thinking that He was forsaken by God. His soul was tortured\nby the pressure of great darkness, lest He should swerve from His\nuprightness during the terrible ordeal.\nUnless there is a possibility of yielding, temptation is no tempta-\ntion. Temptation is resisted when man is powerfully influenced to\ndo a wrong action; and, knowing that he can do it, resists, by faith,\nwith a firm hold upon divine power. This was the ordeal through\nwhich Christ passed.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, July 20, 1899.\nWe May Overcome as Christ Overcame\u2014The love and jus-\ntice of God, and also the immutability of His law, are made manifest\nby the Saviour\u2019s life, no less than by His death. He assumed human\nnature, with its infirmities, its liabilities, its temptations.... He was\n\u201cin all points tempted like as we are\u201d (Hebrews 4:15). He exercised\nin His own behalf no power which man cannot exercise. As man He\nmet temptation, and overcame in the strength given Him of God. He\ngives us an example of perfect obedience. He has provided that we\nmay become partakers of the divine nature, and assures us that we\nmay overcome as He overcame. His life testified that by the aid of\nthe same divine power which Christ received, it is possible for man\nto obey God\u2019s law.\u2014Manuscript 141, 1901.\nGod Sent a Sinless Being to This World\nGod did for us the very best thing that He could do when He sent\nfrom heaven a Sinless Being to manifest to this world of sin what\n120 Selected Messages Book 3\nthose who are saved must be in character\u2014pure, holy, and undefiled,[133]\nhaving Christ formed within. He sent His ideal in His Son, and bade\nmen build characters in harmony with this ideal.\u2014Letter 58, 1906.\nMan Created With Sinless Moral Nature\nIn the councils of heaven God said, \u201cLet us make man in our\nimage, after our likeness.... So God created man in his own image,\nin the image of God created he him\u201d (Genesis 1:26, 27). The Lord\ncreated man\u2019s moral faculties and his physical powers. All was a\nsinless transcript of Himself. God endowed man with holy attributes,\nand placed him in a garden made expressly for him. Sin alone could\nruin the beings created by the hand of the Almighty.\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, July 20, 1899.\nSickness of Others Carried Vicariously\nChrist alone was able to bear the afflictions of all the human\nfamily. \u201cIn all their afflictions he was afflicted.\u201d He never bore\ndisease in His own flesh, but He carried the sickness of others.\nWhen suffering humanity pressed about Him, He who was in the\nhealth of perfect manhood was as one afflicted with them....\nIn His life on earth, Christ developed a perfect character, He\nrendered perfect obedience to His Father\u2019s commandments. In com-\ning to the world in human form, in becoming subject to the law,\nin revealing to men that He bore their sickness, their sorrow, their\nguilt, He did not become a sinner. Before the Pharisees He could\nsay, \u201cWhich of you convinceth me of sin?\u201d Not one stain of sin was\nfound upon Him. He stood before the world the spotless Lamb of\nGod.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, December 29, 1898.\nChrist\u2019s Sinlessness Disturbed Satan\nChrist, the Redeemer of the world, was not situated where the\ninfluences surrounding Him were the best calculated to preserve a\nlife of purity and untainted morals, yet He was not contaminated. He[134]\nwas not free from temptation. Satan was earnest and persevering in\nhis efforts to deceive and overcome the Son of God by his devices.\nIncarnation 121\nChrist was the only one who walked the earth upon whom there\nrested no taint of sin. He was pure, spotless, and undefiled. That\nthere should be One without the defilement of sin upon the earth,\ngreatly disturbed the author of sin, and he left no means untried to\novercome Christ with his wily, deceptive power. But our Saviour\nrelied upon His heavenly Father for wisdom and strength to resist\nand overcome the tempter. The Spirit of His heavenly Father an-\nimated and regulated His life. He was sinless. Virtue and purity\ncharacterized His life.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, February, 1873.\nOur Fallen Human Nature Connected With Christ\u2019s Divinity\nThough He had no taint of sin upon His character, yet He conde-\nscended to connect our fallen human nature with His divinity. By\nthus taking humanity, He honored humanity. Having taken our fallen\nnature, He showed what it might become, by accepting the ample\nprovision He has made for it, and by becoming partaker of the divine\nnature.\u2014Letter 81, 1896.\nTempted as Children Today Are\nOne may think that Christ, because He was the Son of God,\ndid not have temptations as children now have. The Scriptures say\nHe was tempted in all points like as we are tempted.\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, April, 1873.\nWhat the Incarnation Accomplishes\nThe Lord did not make man to be redeemed, but to bear His\nimage. But through sin man lost the image of God. It is only by\nman\u2019s redemption that God can accomplish His design for him in\nmaking him a son of God.\n\u201cAs many as received him, to them gave he power to become [135]\nthe sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: which were\nborn, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of\nman, but of God. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among\nus, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of\nthe Father,) full of grace and truth.... And of his fulness have all we\nreceived, and grace for grace\u201d (John 1:12-16).\n122 Selected Messages Book 3\nBecause of the ransom paid for him, man, by his own choice,\nby obedience, may accomplish the design of God, and through the\ngrace given of God bear the image that was first impressed upon\nhim, and afterwards lost through the fall....\nChrist\u2019s Obedience Not Altogether Different From Ours \u2014\nThe great teacher came into our world, not only to atone for sin\nbut to be a teacher both by precept and example. He came to show\nman how to keep the law in humanity, so that man might have no\nexcuse for following his own defective judgment. We see Christ\u2019s\nobedience. His life was without sin. His lifelong obedience is a\nreproach to disobedient humanity. The obedience of Christ is not to\nbe put aside as altogether different from the obedience He requires\nof us individually. Christ has shown us that it is possible for all\nhumanity to obey the laws of God....\nThe work of Christ was not a divided heart service. Christ came\nnot to do his own will but the will of Him that sent Him. Jesus says,\n\u201cStep in the footprints of my Sonship in all obedience. I obey as in\npartnership with the great firm. You are to obey as in co-partnership\nwith the Son of God. Often you will not see the path clearly; then\nask of God, and He will give you wisdom and courage and faith to\nmove forward, leaving all issues with Him.\u201d We want to comprehend\nso far as possible the truly human nature of our Lord. The divine\nand human were linked in Christ, and both were complete.\nOur Saviour took up the true relationship of a human being as\nthe Son of God. We are sons and daughters of God. In order to\nknow how to behave ourselves circumspectly, we must follow where[136]\nChrist leads the way. For thirty years He lived the life of a perfect\nman, meeting the highest standard of perfection. Then let man,\nhowever imperfect, hope in God, saying not, \u201cIf I were of a different\ndisposition I would serve God,\u201d but bring himself to Him in true\nservice.... That nature has been redeemed by Me. \u201cAs many as\nreceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God,\neven to them that believe on his name\u201d (John 1:12)\u2014you are not\ndegraded, but raised, ennobled, refined by Me. You can find refuge\nin Me. You can obtain victory and be more than conquerors in My\nname.\u2014Letter 69, 1897.\nIncarnation 123\nSatan Declared That Man Could Not Keep God\u2019s Law\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer passed over the ground where Adam fell\nbecause of his disobeying the expressed law of Jehovah; and the\nonly begotten Son of God came to our world as a man, to reveal\nto the world that men could keep the law of God. Satan, the fallen\nangel, had declared that no man could keep the law of God after the\ndisobedience of Adam. He claimed the whole race under his control.\nThe Son of God placed Himself in the sinner\u2019s stead, and passed\nover the ground where Adam fell, and endured the temptation in\nthe wilderness, which was a hundredfold stronger than was or ever\nwill be brought to bear upon the human race. Jesus resisted the\ntemptations of Satan in the same manner that every tempted soul\nmay resist, by referring him to the inspired record and saying, \u201cIt is\nwritten.\u201d\nHumanity Can Keep God\u2019s Law by Divine Power \u2014Christ\novercame the temptations of Satan as a man. Every man may over-\ncome as Christ overcame. He humbled Himself for us. He was\ntempted in all points like as we are. He redeemed Adam\u2019s dis-\ngraceful failure and fall, and was conqueror, thus testifying to all\nthe unfallen worlds and to fallen humanity that man could keep the\ncommandments of God through the divine power granted to him\nof heaven. Jesus the Son of God humbled Himself for us, endured [137]\ntemptation for us, overcame in our behalf to show us how we may\novercome. He has thus bound up His interests with humanity by the\nclosest ties, and has given the positive assurance that we shall not\nbe tempted above that we are able, for with the temptation He will\nmake a way of escape.\nThe Holy Spirit Enables Us to Be Victorious \u2014The Holy\nSpirit was promised to be with those who were wrestling for victory,\nin demonstration of all mightiness, endowing the human agent with\nsupernatural powers, and instructing the ignorant in the mysteries of\nthe kingdom of God. That the Holy Spirit is to be the grand helper,\nis a wonderful promise. Of what avail would it have been to us that\nthe only begotten Son of God had humbled Himself, endured the\ntemptations of the wily foe, and wrestled with him during his entire\nlife on earth, and died the Just for the unjust that humanity might\nnot perish, if the Spirit had not been given as a constant, working,\n124 Selected Messages Book 3\nregenerating agent to make effectual in our cases what has been\nwrought out by the world\u2019s Redeemer?\nThe imparted Holy Spirit enabled His disciples, the apostles, to\nstand firmly against every species of idolatry and to exalt the Lord\nand Him alone. Who, but Jesus Christ by His Spirit and divine\npower, guided the pens of the sacred historians that to the world\nmight be presented the precious record of the sayings and works of\nJesus Christ?\nThe promised Holy Spirit, whom He would send after He as-\ncended to His Father, is constantly at work to draw the attention to\nthe great official sacrifice upon the cross of Calvary, and to unfold\nto the world the love of God to man, and to open to the convicted\nsoul the precious things in the Scriptures, and to open to darkened\nminds the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, the truths that\nmake their hearts burn within them with the awakened intelligence\nof the truths of eternity.\nWho but the Holy Spirit presents before the mind the moral[138]\nstandard of righteousness and convinces of sin, and produces godly\nsorrow which worketh repentance that needeth not to be repented of,\nand inspires the exercise of faith in Him who alone can save from\nall sin.\nWho but the Holy Spirit can work with human minds to transform\ncharacter by withdrawing the affections from those things which\nare temporal, perishable, and imbues the soul with earnest desire by\npresenting the immortal inheritance, the eternal substance which is\nimperishable, and recreates, refines, and sanctifies the human agents\nthat they may become members of the royal family, children of the\nheavenly king....\nChrist Overcame Sin as a Man\u2014The fall of our first parents\nbroke the golden chain of implicit obedience of the human will to the\ndivine. Obedience has no longer been deemed an absolute necessity.\nThe human agents follow their own imaginations, which the Lord\nsaid of the inhabitants of the old world were evil and that continually.\nThe Lord Jesus declares, I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments.\nHow? As a man. Lo, I come to do Thy will, O God. To the\naccusations of the Jews He stood forth in His pure, virtuous, holy\ncharacter and challenged them, \u201cWho of you convinceth me of sin?\u201d\nIncarnation 125\nOur Example and Sacrifice for Sin \u2014The world\u2019s Redeemer\ncame not only to be a sacrifice for sin but to be an example to man\nin all things, a holy, human character. He was a Teacher, such an\neducator as the world never saw or heard before. He spake as one\nhaving authority, and yet He invites the confidence of all. \u201cCome\nunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you\nrest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and\nlowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke\nis easy, and my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30).\nThe only begotten Son of the infinite God has, by His words\n[and], His practical example left us a plain pattern which we are to\ncopy. By His words He has educated us to obey God, and by His\nown practice He has showed us how we can obey God.\nNot only did Christ give explicit rules showing how we may [139]\nbecome obedient children but He showed us in His own life and\ncharacter just how to do those things which are right and acceptable\nwith God, so there is no excuse why we should not do those things\nwhich are pleasing in His sight.\nHe Disproved Satan\u2019s Claim\u2014We are ever to be thankful that\nJesus has proved to us by actual facts that man can keep the com-\nmandments of God, giving contradiction to Satan\u2019s falsehood that\nman cannot keep them. The Great Teacher came to our world to\nstand at the head of humanity, to thus elevate and sanctify humanity\nby His holy obedience to all of God\u2019s requirements showing it is pos-\nsible to obey all the commandments of God. He has demonstrated\nthat a lifelong obedience is possible. Thus He gives chosen, repre-\nsentative men to the world, as the Father gave the Son, to exemplify\nin their life the life of Jesus Christ.\nHe Stood the Test as a True Human Being \u2014We need not\nplace the obedience of Christ by itself as something for which He\nwas particularly adapted, by His particular divine nature, for He\nstood before God as man\u2019s representative and tempted as man\u2019s\nsubstitute and surety. If Christ had a special power which it is not\nthe privilege of man to have, Satan would have made capital of\nthis matter. The work of Christ was to take from the claims of\nSatan his control of man, and He could do this only in the way that\nHe came\u2014a man, tempted as a man, rendering the obedience of a\nman....\n126 Selected Messages Book 3\nBear in mind that Christ\u2019s overcoming and obedience is that of\na true human being. In our conclusions, we make many mistakes\nbecause of our erroneous views of the human nature of our Lord.\nWhen we give to His human nature a power that it is not possible for\nman to have in His conflicts with Satan, we destroy the completeness\nof His humanity. His imputed grace and power He gives to all who\nreceive Him by faith. The obedience of Christ to His Father was the\nsame obedience that is required of man. [140]\nMan cannot overcome Satan\u2019s temptations without divine power\nto combine with His instrumentality. So with Jesus Christ, He could\nlay hold of divine power. He came not to our world to give the\nobedience of a lesser God to a greater, but as a man to obey God\u2019s\nHoly Law, and in this way He is our example.\nJesus Showed What Man Could Do\u2014The Lord Jesus came to\nour world, not to reveal what a God could do, but what a man could\ndo, through faith in God\u2019s power to help in every emergency. Man is,\nthrough faith, to be a partaker in the divine nature, and to overcome\nevery temptation wherewith he is beset. The Lord now demands that\nevery son and daughter of Adam through faith in Jesus Christ, serve\nHim in [the] human nature which we now have.\nThe Lord Jesus has bridged the gulf that sin has made. He has\nconnected earth with heaven, and finite man with the infinite God.\nJesus, the world\u2019s Redeemer, could only keep the commandments\nof God in the same way that humanity can keep them. \u201cWhereby\nare given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by\nthese ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust\u201d (2 Peter 1:4)....\nWe must practice the example of Christ, bearing in mind His\nSonship and His humanity. It was not God that was tempted in\nthe wilderness, nor a God that was to endure the contradiction of\nsinners against Himself. It was the Majesty of heaven who became\na man\u2014humbled Himself to our human nature.\nHow We Are to Serve God\u2014We are not to serve God as if we\nwere not human, but we are to serve Him in the nature we have, that\nhas been redeemed by the Son of God; through the righteousness of\nChrist we shall stand before God pardoned, and as though we had\nnever sinned. We will never gain strength in considering what we\nmight do if we were angels. We are to turn in faith to Jesus Christ,\nIncarnation 127\nand show our love to God through obedience to his commands. Jesus [141]\n\u201cwas in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\u201d Jesus says,\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d \u201cIf any man will come after me, let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow me.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 1, 1892.\nReal Meaning of the Incarnation\nChrist took upon Himself humanity, and laid down his life a\nsacrifice, that man, by becoming a partaker of the divine nature,\nmight have eternal life. Not only was Christ the Sacrifice but he\nwas also the Priest who offered the sacrifice. \u201cThe bread that I will\ngive,\u201d said He, \u201cis my flesh, which I will give for the life of the\nworld\u201d (John 6:51). He was innocent of all guilt. He gave Himself\nin exchange for the people who had sold themselves to Satan by\ntransgression of God\u2019s law\u2014his life for the life of the human family,\nwho thereby became his purchased possession.\n\u201cTherefore doth my Father love me,\u201d said Christ, \u201cbecause I lay\ndown my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me,\nbut I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have\npower to take it again. This commandment have I received of my\nFather\u201d (John 10:17, 18).\n\u201cThe wages of sin is death\u201d (Romans 6:23). To Adam before\nhis fall the Lord said, \u201cIn the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt\nsurely die\u201d (Genesis 2:17). \u201cIf you transgress my law, death will\nsurely be your punishment.\u201d By disobeying God\u2019s command, he\nforfeited his life.\nBefore his fall Adam was free from the results of the curse.\nWhen he was assailed by the tempter, none of the effects of sin were\nupon him. He was created perfect in thought and in action. But he\nyielded to sin, and fell from his high and holy estate.\nIn the Likeness of Sinful Flesh \u2014Christ, the second Adam,\ncame in the likeness of sinful flesh. In man\u2019s behalf, he became\nsubject to sorrow, to weariness, to hunger, and to thirst. He was\nsubject to temptation, but he yielded not to sin. No taint of sin was [142]\nupon Him. He declared, \u201cI have kept my Father\u2019s commandments [in\nMy earthly life]\u201d (John 15:10). He had infinite power only because\nhe was perfectly obedient to his Father\u2019s will. The second Adam\n128 Selected Messages Book 3\nstood the test of trial and temptation that he might become the Owner\nof all humanity.\u2014Manuscript 99, 1903.\nSection 5\u2014Principles of Salvation [143]\nIntroduction[144]\nThe basic elements of salvation are presented in one form or\nanother in almost every Ellen G. White book and in innumerable\nperiodical articles. The Bible studies and discussions at the 1888\nMinneapolis General Conference brought into focus the elements of\nsalvation by faith in Christ alone, which was a truth that had been\nlargely lost sight of by many, both ministers and laity. Selected Mes-\nsages, book 1, in its 51-page section on \u201cChrist Our Righteousness,\u201d\nsets forth this emphasis in the setting of Minneapolis. How Ellen\nWhite rejoiced as the great basic truth of justification by faith was\nbrought prominently to the front at this conference, and as she en-\ntered with others into carrying the blessed message to the churches!\nThis was a truth, however, that had entered into her sermons and\nwritings down through the years, always presented in a balanced\nmanner. This is attested to by the several presentations that make\nup the Ellen G. White book Faith and Works, containing discourses\nand articles from 1881 to 1902.\nThis section brings together in three chapters the vital truths\nrelating to faith and works. The first chapter is devoted to typical\nstatements made by Ellen White from 1850 to 1888 showing her\nclear-cut stand in a balanced presentation of justification by faith.\nThe third chapter brings to view her consistent declarations, showing\na unity of teaching all through her ministry. Only a few typical\nstatements are included to remind us of her work in presenting this\nvital truth, which is the very heart of the gospel. Chapter two,\nhistorical in nature, presents her review of the experience at the\nMinneapolis General Conference and the work on her part, related\nto this experience, in the months that followed that conference. This\nchapter is introduced by a somewhat extended statement giving a\nbackground for her historical review.\nWhite Trustees.\n130\nChapter 20\u2014Principles as Set Forth by Ellen White [145]\nin Her Early Ministry\nLook Away From Self to Jesus\u20141850\u2014Said the angel, \u201cHave\nfaith in God.\u201d I saw some tried too hard to believe. Faith is so\nsimple, ye look above it. Satan tried to deceive some of the honest\nchildren and had got them looking to self to find worthiness there.\nI saw they must look away from self to the worthiness of Jesus\nand throw themselves just as dependent and unworthy as they are\nupon his mercy and draw by faith strength and nourishment from\nHim.\u2014Letter 8, 1850.\nDepend Solely on Merits of Jesus\u20141862\u2014Every member of\nthe family should bear in mind that all have just as much as they can\ndo to resist our wily foe, and with earnest prayers and unyielding\nfaith each must rely upon the merits of the blood of Christ and claim\nhis saving strength.\nThe powers of darkness gather about the soul and shut Jesus from\nour sight, and at times we can only wait in sorrow and amazement\nuntil the cloud passes over. These seasons are sometimes terrible.\nHope seems to fail, and despair seizes upon us. In these dreadful\nhours we must learn to trust, to depend solely upon the merits of the\natonement, and in all our helpless unworthiness cast ourselves upon\nthe merits of the crucified and risen Saviour. We shall never perish\nwhile we do this\u2014 never!\u2014Testimonies for the Church 1:309, 310 [146]\n(1862).\nThe Truth to Sanctify the Life\u20141869\u2014Brother and Sister P\nhave a work to do to set their own house and hearts in order.... He\n[Brother P] has not seen and felt the necessity of the Spirit of God\nupon the heart to influence the life, the words, and acts. He has made\nhis religious experience too much of a form.\nThe theory of the truth he has seen and acknowledged, but the\nspecial work of sanctification through the truth he has not become\nacquainted with. Self has appeared. If anything was spoken in\nmeeting which did not meet his standard, he would rebuke, not in\n131\n132 Selected Messages Book 3\nlove and humility, but harshly with severe cutting words. This strong\nlanguage is not proper for any Christian to use, especially one who\nhas need of much greater experience himself, and who has very\nmany wrongs to correct.\u2014Manuscript 2, 1869.\nThe Fruit True Sanctification Produces\u20141874 \u2014You have\nheld views of sanctification and holiness which have not been of that\ngenuine article which produces fruit of the right quality. Sanctifi-\ncation is not an outward work. It does not consist in praying and\nexhorting in meeting but it takes hold of the very life and molds the\nwords and actions, transforming the character....\nThere seem to be important positions that need to be filled by\nmen who are truly sanctified, having the spirit of the Master. And\nthere is a most positive necessity of overcoming self that their work\nand efforts should not be marred by the defects in their character.\u2014\nManuscript 6, 1874.\nCharacter Perfected by Enoch and Elijah\u20141874\u2014Some few\nin every generation from Adam resisted his every artifice and stood\nforth as noble representatives of what it was in the power of man to\ndo and to be\u2014Christ working with human efforts, helping man in\novercoming the power of Satan. Enoch and Elijah are the correct\nrepresentatives of what the race might be through faith in Jesus Christ\nif they chose to be. Satan was greatly disturbed because these noble,[147]\nholy men stood untainted amid the moral pollution surrounding\nthem, perfected righteous characters, and were accounted worthy\nfor translation to heaven. As they had stood forth in moral power\nin noble uprightness, overcoming Satan\u2019s temptations, he could not\nbring them under the dominion of death. He triumphed that he had\npower to overcome Moses with his temptations, and that he could\nmar his illustrious character and lead him to the sin of taking glory\nto himself before the people which belonged to God.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, March 3, 1874.\nFaith and Works in Salvation\u20141878\u2014All your good works\ncannot save you; but it is nevertheless impossible for you to be saved\nwithout good works.

But Jesus is your Saviour. He does not save\nPrinciples as Set Forth by Ellen White in Her Early Ministry 133\nyou because you are perfect, but because you need Him and in your\nimperfection have trusted in Him.

I can find nothing of which to boast, no merit\nthat I can plead.\n\u201cUnworthy, unworthy of the least of Thy favors, O my God,\u201d is\nmy cry. My only hope is in a crucified and risen Saviour.

We must bear\nthe perfect image of Christ. Every thought must be brought into\nsubjection to the will of Christ. As expressed by the great apostle,\nwe must come \u201cunto the measure of the stature of the fulness of\nChrist.\u201d We shall never attain to this condition without earnest effort.\nWe must strive daily against outward evil and inward sin, if we\nwould reach the perfection of Christian character.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, May 30, 1882.\n134 Selected Messages Book 3\nBasic Elements Presented at the 1883 General Conference\nIntroductory Note: At the General Conference session held in\n1883 at Battle Creek, Michigan, Ellen White addressed the ministers\nat thirteen consecutive morning meetings and spoke to the confer-\nence on the closing Sabbath. The Review and Herald The next year\ncarried the entire series. In four of the addresses she set forth the\nprinciples of righteousness by faith, as presented in the selections\nwhich follow. A further basic address,\u201cChrist Our Righteousness,\u201d\nkeyed to these meetings, was first published in Gospel Workers,\n1893 edition, 411, and reprinted in Selected Messages 1:350-354,\nand Faith and Works, 35-39.\u2014Compilers.\nFriday, November 9, 1883\u2014Look to Jesus\u2014On this morning\nthere was a spirit of earnest intercession for the Lord to reveal Him-\nself among us in power. My heart was especially drawn out in prayer,\nand the Lord heard and blessed us. Testimonies were borne by many\ndiscouraged ones, who felt that their imperfections were so great\nthat the Lord could not use them in his cause. This was the language[149]\nof unbelief.\nI tried to point these dear souls to Jesus, who is our refuge, a\npresent help in every time of need. He does not give us up because\nof our sins. We may make mistakes and grieve his Spirit, but when\nwe repent, and come to Him with contrite hearts, he will not turn us\naway....\nSabbath, November 10, 1883\u2014Come As You Are \u2014I have\nlistened to testimonies like this: \u201cI have not the light that I desire;\nI have not the assurance of the favor of God.\u201d Such testimonies\nexpress only unbelief and darkness.\nAre you expecting that your merit will recommend you to the\nfavor of God, and that you must be free from sin before you trust\nhis power to save? If this is the struggle going on in your mind, I\nfear you will gain no strength, and will finally become discouraged.\nAs the brazen serpent was lifted up in the wilderness, so was Christ\nlifted up to draw all men unto Him. All who looked upon that\nserpent, the means that God had provided, were healed; so in our\nsinfulness, in our great need, we must \u201clook and live.\u201d\nWhile we realize our helpless condition without Christ, we must\nnot be discouraged; we must rely upon the merits of a crucified\nPrinciples as Set Forth by Ellen White in Her Early Ministry 135\nand risen Saviour.

He is pleading for us in the most\nholy place of the heavenly sanctuary, and he will forgive our sins. It\nmakes all the difference in the world with us spiritually whether we\nrely upon God without doubt, as upon a sure foundation, or whether\nwe are seeking to find some righteousness in ourselves before we\ncome to Him. Look away from self to the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world. It is a sin to doubt. The least unbelief,\nif cherished in the heart, involves the soul in guilt, and brings great\ndarkness and discouragement....\nSome seem to feel that they must be on probation and must prove [150]\nto the Lord that they are reformed before they can claim his blessing.\nBut these dear souls may claim the blessing of God even now. They\nmust have his grace, the spirit of Christ to help their infirmities, or\nthey cannot form Christian characters. Jesus loves to have us come\nto Him just as we are\u2014sinful, helpless, dependent. We claim to be\nchildren of the light, not of the night nor of darkness; what right have\nwe to be unbelieving?\u2014The Review and Herald, April 22, 1884.\nWednesday, November 14, 1883\u2014True Religion Means\nConformity to God\u2019s Will\u2014Some are ever looking to themselves\ninstead of to Jesus; but, brethren, you want to be clothed in Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness. If you are trusting in your own righteousness, you\nare weak indeed; for you are exposed to the darts of Satan, and after\nthe privileges you are now enjoying, you will have severe conflicts\nto meet.

To many the peace and rest of this blessed way\nseems no nearer today than it did years in the past. They look afar\noff for that which is nigh; they make intricate that which Jesus made\nvery plain. He is \u201cthe way, the truth, and the life.\u201d The plan of salva-\ntion has been plainly revealed in the Word of God; but the wisdom\nof the world has been sought too much, and the wisdom of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness too little. And souls that might have rested in the love\nof Jesus, have been doubting, and troubled about many things.\nThe testimonies borne here are not expressive of great faith. It\nis not hard to believe that Jesus will pardon others, but it seems\nimpossible for each to exercise living faith for himself. But, dear\nbrethren, is it profitable to express doubts in regard to the willingness\nof Christ to accept you? I fear you are depending too much on\nfeeling, making that a criterion. You are losing much by this course;\nyou are not only weakening your own souls, but the souls of others\nwho look to you.\nYou must trust Jesus for yourselves, appropriate the promises of\nGod to yourselves, or how can you educate others to have humble,\nholy confidence in Him? You feel that you have neglected duties,\nthat you have not prayed as you should.\nYou seem at a distance from Jesus, and think that he has with-\ndrawn from you; but it is you who have separated from Him. He\nis waiting for you to return. He will accept the contrite heart.

White Reports on the [156]\nMinneapolis Conference\nA Statement Presenting the Historical Backgrounds\nThis chapter presents a statement by Ellen White prepared a few\nweeks after the close of the General Conference of 1888. She looks\nback upon the scene and describes what took place. The meetings\nat Minneapolis came into better perspective as the months elapsed,\nand Ellen White\u2019s statement is most enlightening and significant. A\nbrief review of the historical setting is in place.\nThe Minneapolis General Conference was notable for the Bible\nstudies and discussions on the law in Galatians and on the righteous-\nness of Christ received by faith.\nThis session, attended by ninety-one delegates, was held October\n17 to November 4 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in our newly built\nchurch. As is customary, a number of Seventh-day Adventists who\nwere not delegates were also present. The session was preceded by a\nseven-day ministerial institute, which met from October 10 through\nOctober 16. The Bible studies commenced in the institute in some\ncases continued into the General Conference session, occupying the\nBible study hour.\nEllen White was present and participated in both the institute\nand the nineteen-day session. The session itself was quite routine,\nbut constructive. Reports were received and meetings of various\nassociations, such as Sabbath School, Health and Temperance, and [157]\nTract and Missionary, were held. Fields of labor were assigned to the\nministers, plans were laid for the advancement of the cause, officers\nwere elected, and committees appointed.\nAn on-the-ground review of accomplishments and sentiments\ncomes to us from the pen of W. C. White, who, two days before\nthe close of the session, wrote to a fellow minister laboring in the\nSouthern States:\n141\n142 Selected Messages Book 3\n\u201cWe are just at the close of another General Conference, and in\na few days the delegates will be scattered to their respective fields,\nand another year\u2019s work begun.\n\u201cThis has been a very interesting conference, and although not\naccompanied with all that peace and harmony that sometimes has\nbeen manifest, it is perhaps as profitable a meeting as was ever\nheld, for many important principles were made prominent, and\nsome conclusions arrived at, that will be of great value, as they\nmay influence our future work. Many go forth from this meeting\ndetermined to study the Bible as never before, and this will result in\nclearer preaching.\n\u201cAs you have no doubt noticed in the Bulletin, many advance\nsteps have been taken as to our foreign missions, also some good\nmoves for the advancement of the work in the South.\u201d\u2014W. C.\nWhite letter to Smith Sharp, written from Minneapolis, Minnesota,\nNovember 2, 1888.\nIt will be observed that together with his report of progress,\nElder White made mention of the lack of \u201cpeace and harmony that\nsometimes has been manifest\u201d in our General Conference sessions.\nIn this he was referring to the theological discussions that made\nthe 1888 meeting different from any other General Conference in\nAdventist history.\nThese discussions began in the week-long ministerial institute,\nwhen, according to the agenda, such topics as the ten kingdoms, the\ndivinity of Christ, the healing of the deadly wound, and justification\nby faith were to be considered. The discussion of the ten kingdoms\ngrew bitter and consumed a disproportionate amount of time. Some\ntopics scheduled were crowded out. Near the close of the institute[158]\nElder E. J. Waggoner, associate editor of the Signs of the Times,\nbegan a series of studies, on the law in Galatians, that merged into his\npresentation of the Christian\u2019s faith and the righteousness of Christ.\nThese continued through the first week of the General Conference\nsession.\nIt was this series of studies, especially those that touched on the\ndivisive subject of the law in Galatians, that sparked the controversy\nthat followed. No transcription of the discussions was made, but the\nsketchy notes of one or two delegates, Ellen White\u2019s records, and\nthe recollections of many who were present reveal the bitterness of\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 143\nthe controversy and the baleful effects of the negative attitude of\nseveral prominent church leaders.\nEven before the delegates assembled at Minneapolis there had\nbeen dispute on the key theological topics for several years. There\nwas also building in the hearts of some an attitude of resistance to and\nnonacceptance of Ellen White\u2019s messages of warning and reproof.\nShe early observed a strange and antagonistic attitude manifested\ntoward her by some of the leading ministers.\nAs E. J. Waggoner led into an examination of the law in Gala-\ntians and salvation by faith, a debating spirit dominated some in the\ndiscussions. This greatly troubled Ellen White. Although she was\nnot ready to agree with Elder Waggoner on all the fine points of his\npresentations on the law in Galatians, her heart was warmed by his\nclear enunciation of the principles of justification by faith and of\nrighteousness obtained through faith in Christ. She spoke twenty\ntimes in Minneapolis, and especially in the early morning ministers\u2019\nmeetings she pleaded for open-minded Bible study. She herself did\nnot speak on the topic of righteousness by faith.\nThe reactions to the emphasis on this vital truth were mixed. At\nthe 1893 General Conference session, A. T. Jones, speaking of the\nreception of the truths set forth at Minneapolis, reported: \u201cI know\nthat some there accepted it; others rejected it entirely. You know the\nsame thing. Others tried to stand half way between, and get it that [159]\nway.\u201d\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, 1893, 185.\nThe discussions were at times heated. Some, fearing that the\nnew emphasis would weaken the church\u2019s strong position on God\u2019s\nlaw, particularly the Sabbath truth, strongly resisted the message on\nrighteousness by faith. No conference actions were taken on this\npoint or any other point brought forward in the Bible studies.\nEllen White reported in a letter written on the closing day of the\nsession, a letter appearing in this section, \u201cMy courage and faith\nhave been good,\u201d notwithstanding the almost \u201cincomprehensible tug\nof war\u201d they had been through, and she expressed the conviction, as\nshe saw it at close range, that the \u201cmeeting will result in great good\u201d\n(Letter 82, 1888). A few weeks later she wrote her statement looking\nback at the Minneapolis General Conference, a major portion of\nwhich is embodied in this section.\n144 Selected Messages Book 3\nIn the weeks and months following the session a hard core of\nopposition developed in Battle Creek, the church headquarters and\nthe location of three of its major institutions. Ellen White frequently\nabsented herself from Battle Creek, going into the field to carry the\nmessage to the churches. At times she worked with Elders Jones\nand Waggoner as all three engaged in presenting the precious truths\nof the gospel. She led out in an important and successful meeting\nof our ministers in January, 1889, in South Lancaster, where many\nwere \u201cgreatly blessed.\u201d A report is included in this chapter.\nThe Ellen G. White files carry a powerful address on the basic\nprinciples of salvation by faith as given at the Ottawa, Kansas, camp\nmeeting, May 11, 1889. This and her report on the response appear\nin the E.G. White book Faith and Works, 63-84.\nThere was victory in Chicago, and at Denver, Colorado, where at\nthe camp meeting held in September, 1889, she spoke to the workers\non the need for a true concept of righteousness by faith. The Denver\naddress appears in this section.\nWhile attending the General Conference session of 1889, held[160]\njust a year after the Minneapolis meeting, she reported:\n\u201cWe are having most excellent meetings. The spirit that was in\nthe meeting at Minneapolis is not here. All moves off in harmony.\nThere is a large attendance of delegates. Our five o\u2019clock morning\nmeeting is well attended, and the meetings good. All the testimonies\nto which I have listened have been of an elevating character. They\nsay that the past year has been the best of their life; the light shining\nforth from the Word of God has been clear and distinct\u2014justification\nby faith, Christ our righteousness. The experiences have been very\ninteresting.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 10, 1889 (published in Selected Messages\n1:361).\nOn February 3, 1890, as she addressed the ministers assembled in\nBattle Creek for a ministerial institute, she reviewed her experiences\nin the field during 1889. Her statement forms an appropriate part of\nthis introduction:\n\u201cWe have traveled all through to the different places of the meet-\nings that I might stand side by side with the messengers of God that\nI knew were His messengers\u2014that I knew had a message for His\npeople. I gave my message with them right in harmony with the\nvery message they were bearing. What did we see?\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 145\n\u201cWe saw a power attending the message. In every instance we\nworked\u2014and some know how hard we worked\u2014I think it was a\nwhole week, going early and late, at Chicago, in order that we might\nget these ideas in the minds of the brethren.\n\u201cThe devil has been working for a year to obliterate these ideas\u2014\nthe whole of them. And it takes hard work to change their old\nopinions; they think they have got to trust in their own righteousness,\nand in their own works, and keep looking at themselves, and not\nappropriating the righteousness of Christ, and bringing it into their\nlife, and into their character. And we worked there for one week....\nOne week had passed away before there was a break, and the power\nof God, like a tidal wave, rolled over that congregation. I tell you, it [161]\nwas to set men free; it was to point them to the Lamb of God which\ntaketh away the sins of the world.\n\u201cAnd there at South Lancaster, the mighty movings of the Spirit\nof God were there. Some are here that were in that meeting. God\nrevealed His glory, and every student in the College was brought to\nthe door there in confession; and the movings of the Spirit of God\nwere there.\n\u201cAnd thus [it was] from place to place. Everywhere we went we\nsaw the movings of the Spirit of God.\n\u201cDo you think, like the ten lepers, I shall keep silent, that I shall\nnot raise my voice to sing the righteousness of God and praise Him\nand glorify Him? I try to present it to you, that you may see the\nevidence that I saw: but it seems that the words go as into empty air;\nand how long is it to be thus? How long will the people at the heart\nof the work hold themselves against God? How long will men here\nsustain them in doing this work? Get out of the way, brethren. Take\nyour hand off the ark of God, and let the Spirit of God come in and\nwork in mighty power.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 9, 1890.\nNote the sentiment of the last paragraph just quoted. While\nthe reception of the message of salvation by faith was resisted by\nsome at the Minneapolis General Conference and accepted by others\nin the days that followed, resistance built up rapidly at the heart\nof the work. The reception among church members in the field, as\nreported by Ellen White, was quite different. The stubborn resistance\nparticipated in by \u201csome\u201d (see Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel\n146 Selected Messages Book 3\nWorkers, 363.) at the very headquarters of the church greatly retarded\nthe work that the Lord intended should be accomplished.\nOf this Ellen White wrote as the year 1890 came to a close: \u201cThe\nprejudices and opinions that prevailed at Minneapolis are not dead\nby any means; the seeds sown there in some hearts are ready to\nspring into life and bear a like harvest\u201d (Testimonies to Ministers\nand Gospel Workers, 467).\nIn this same connection she wrote: \u201cSome have failed to distin- [162]\nguish between pure gold and mere glitter.\u201d\u2014Ibid. And she added,\n\u201cThe true religion, the only religion of the Bible, that teaches for-\ngiveness only through the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour,\nthat advocates righteousness by the faith of the Son of God, has been\nslighted, spoken against, ridiculed, and rejected.\u201d\u2014Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 468.\nIn his book Thirteen Crisis Years, Elder A. V . Olson recounts\nthe history and documents the gradual change for better that ensued\nin the five or six years after Minneapolis.\nNonetheless, there was a tragic setback in the advancement\nof the cause of God. Ellen White recognized this and at times\nmentioned it, usually in incidental statements. At no time, however,\ndid she intimate or declare that there was an official rejection by\nchurch leaders of the precious message brought to the attention of\nthe General Conference in 1888. Rather, on December 19, 1892,\njust four years after that notable conference, in a letter addressed\nto \u201cDear Brethren of the General Conference,\u201d she triumphantly\ndeclared:\n\u201cIn reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of\nadvance to our present standing, I can say, Praise God! As I see what\nGod has wrought, I am filled with astonishment and with confidence\nin Christ as Leader. We have nothing to fear for the future, except as\nwe shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our\npast history. We are now a strong people, if we will put our trust in\nthe Lord; for we are handling the mighty truths of the word of God.\nWe have everything to be thankful for.\u201d\u2014The General Conference\nBulletin, 1893, 24 (see Life Sketches, 196; Testimonies to Ministers\nand Gospel Workers, 31).\nAgain, in 1907 she wrote: \u201cThe church is to increase in ac-\ntivity and to enlarge her bounds.... While there have been fierce\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 147\ncontentions in the effort to maintain our distinctive character, yet we\nhave as Bible Christians ever been on gaining ground.\u201d\u2014Letter 170,\n1907 (Selected Messages 2:396, 397).\nWith this background we introduce the historical chapter of this [163]\nsection.\u2014Compilers.\nPrecious Promises Versus Gloomy Pictures\nIt was by faith I ventured to cross the Rocky Mountains for the\npurpose of attending the General Conference held in Minneapolis....\nAt Minneapolis we met a large delegation of ministers. I dis-\ncerned at the very commencement of the meeting a spirit which\nburdened me. Discourses were preached that did not give the people\nthe food which they so much needed. The dark and gloomy side\nof the picture was presented before them to hang in memory\u2019s hall.\nThis would bring no light and spiritual freedom, but discouragement.\nI felt deeply moved by the Spirit of the Lord Sabbath afternoon\n[October 13, 1888] to call the minds of those present to the love\nGod manifests to His people. The mind must not be permitted to\ndwell on the most objectionable features of our faith. In God\u2019s Word,\nwhich may be represented as a garden filled with roses and lilies\nand pinks, we may pluck by faith the precious promises of God,\nappropriate them to our own hearts, and be of good courage\u2014yes,\njoyful in God\u2014or we may keep our attention fastened on the briars\nand thistles and wound ourselves severely and bemoan our hard lot.\nGod is not pleased to have His people hanging dark and painful\npictures in memory\u2019s hall. He would have every soul plucking the\nroses and the lilies and the pinks, hanging memory\u2019s hall with the\nprecious promises of God blooming all over the garden of God. He\nwould have us dwelling upon them, our senses sharp and clear, taking\nthem in in their full richness, talking of the joy that is set before us.\nHe would have us living in the world, yet not of it, our affections\ntaking hold of eternal things. He would have us talking of the things\nwhich He has prepared for those that love Him. This will attract our\nminds, awaken our hopes and expectations, and strengthen our souls\nto endure the conflicts and trials of this life. As we dwell on these [164]\nscenes the Lord will encourage our faith and confidence. He will\ndraw aside the veil and give us glimpses of the saints\u2019 inheritance.\n148 Selected Messages Book 3\nAs I presented the goodness, the love, the tender compassion\nof our heavenly Father, I felt that the Spirit of the Lord was resting\nnot only upon me but upon the people. Light and freedom and\nblessing came to the hearers and there was hearty response to the\nwords spoken. The social meeting that followed evidenced that the\nWord had found lodgment in the hearts of the hearers. Many bore\ntestimony that this day was the happiest of their lives, and it was\nindeed a precious season, for we knew the presence of the Lord\nJesus was in the assembly and that to bless. I knew that the special\nrevealing of the Spirit of God was for a purpose, to quell the doubts,\nto roll back the tide of unbelief which had been admitted into hearts\nand minds concerning Sister White and the work the Lord had given\nher to do.\nMany Refreshed, but Not all\u2014This was a season of refreshing\nto many souls, but it did not abide upon some. Just as soon as\nthey saw that Sister White did not agree with all their ideas and\nharmonize with the propositions and resolutions to be voted upon in\nthat conference, the evidence they had received had as little weight\nwith some as did the words spoken by Christ in the synagogue to\nthe Nazarenes. Their hearts [the hearers at Nazareth] were touched\nby the Spirit of God. They heard as it were God speaking to them\nthrough His Son. They saw, they felt the divine influence of the\nSpirit of God and all witnessed to the gracious words that proceeded\nfrom His mouth. But Satan was at their side with his unbelief and\nthey admitted the questioning and the doubts, and unbelief followed.\nThe Spirit of God was quenched. In their madness they would have\nhurled Jesus from the precipice had not God protected Him that\ntheir rage did not harm Him. When Satan once has control of the\nmind he makes fools and demons of those who have been esteemed\nas excellent men. Prejudice, pride, and stubbornness are terrible\nelements to take possession of the human mind. [165]\nEllen White Counsels With Some of the Leaders \u2014I had re-\nceived a long epistle from Elder Butler, [The president of the General\nConference was detained in Battle Creek because of illness.] which I\nread carefully. I was surprised at its contents. I did not know what to\ndo with this letter, but as the same sentiments expressed in it seemed\nto be working and controlling my brother ministers I called a few of\nthem together in an upper room and read this letter to them. They\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 149\ndid not, any of them, seem to be surprised at its contents, several\nsaying they knew this was the mind of Elder Butler, for they had\nheard him state the same things.\nI then explained many things. I stated that which I knew was\na right and righteous course to be pursued, brother toward brother,\nin the exercise of investigating the Scriptures. I knew the company\nbefore me were not viewing all things in a correct light, therefore I\nstated many things. All my statements set forth correct principles\nto be acted upon, but I feared that my words made no impression\nupon them. They understood things in their way, and the light which\nI told them had been given me was to them as idle tales.\nAppeals at the Morning Meetings\u2014I felt very much pained at\nheart over the condition of things. I made most earnest appeals to\nmy brethren and sisters when assembled in the morning meetings,\nand entreated that we should make this occasion a season of profit,\nsearching the Scriptures together with humility of heart. I entreated\nthat there should not be such freedom in talking in regard to things\nof which they knew but little.\nAll needed to learn lessons in the school of Christ. Jesus has\ninvited, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and\nI will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I\nam meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\nFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30). If [166]\nwe daily learn the lessons of humility and lowliness of heart, there\nwill not be the feelings which existed at this meeting.\nThere are some differences of views on some subjects, but is this\na reason for sharp, hard feelings? Shall envy and evil surmisings and\nimaginings, evil suspicion, hatred, and jealousies become enthroned\nin the heart? All these things are evil and only evil. Our help is in\nGod alone. Let us spend much time in prayer and in searching the\nScriptures with a right spirit\u2014anxious to learn and willing to be\ncorrected or undeceived on any point where we may be in error. If\nJesus is in our midst and our hearts are melted into tenderness by\nHis love we shall have one of the best conferences we have ever\nattended.\nA Busy and Important Session\u2014There was much business to\nbe done. The work had enlarged. New missions had been opened\nand new churches organized. All should be in harmony freely to\n150 Selected Messages Book 3\nconsult together as brethren at work in the great harvest field, all\nworking interestedly in the different branches of the work, and\nunselfishly considering how the Lord\u2019s work could be done to the\nbest advantage. If ever there was a time when, as a conference, we\nneeded the special grace and enlightenment of the Spirit of God,\nit was at this meeting. There was a power from beneath moving\nagencies to bring about a change in the constitution and laws of our\nnation, which will bind the consciences of all those who keep the\nBible Sabbath, plainly specified in the fourth commandment as the\nseventh day.\nThe time has come when every man should be found doing his\nduty to the utmost of his ability to hold up and vindicate the law\nof God before our own people and the world, working to the limit\nof his capacity and entrusted talents. Many are blinded, deceived\nby men who claim to be ministers of the gospel, and they influence\nvery many to consider they are doing a good work for God when it\nis the work of Satan.\nSatan\u2019s Divisive Strategy\u2014Now, Satan had a council as to how[167]\nhe should keep pen and voice of Seventh-day Adventists silent. If\nhe could only engage their attention and divert their powers in a\ndirection to weaken and divide them his prospect would be fair.\nSatan has done his work with some success. There has been\nvariance of feelings, and division. There has been much jealousy\nand evil surmising. There have been many unsanctified speeches,\nhints, and remarks. The minds of the men who should be heart and\nsoul at work, prepared to do mighty strokes for God at this very time\nare absorbed in matters of little consequence. Because the ideas of\nsome are not exactly in accordance with their own on every point\nof doctrine involving minor ideas and theories which are not vital\nquestions, the great question of the nation\u2019s religious liberty, now\ninvolving so much, is to many a matter of little consequence.\nSatan has been having things his own way; but the Lord has\nraised up men and given them a solemn message to bear to His\npeople, to wake up the mighty men to prepare for battle, for the\nday of God\u2019s preparation. This message Satan sought to make of\nnone effect, and when every voice and every pen should have been\nintensely at work to stay the workings and powers of Satan there\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 151\nwas a drawing apart; there were differences of opinion. This was\nnot at all the way of the Lord.\nThe Law in Galatians One Point of Difference\u2014At this meet-\ning the subject of the law in Galatians was brought before the minis-\nters. This subject had been brought into the conference three years\nbefore....\nWe know that if all would come to the Scriptures with hearts\nsubdued and controlled by the influence of the Spirit of God, there\nwould be brought to the examination of the Scriptures a calm mind,\nfree from prejudice and pride of opinion. The light from the Lord\nwould shine upon His Word and the truth would be revealed. But\nthere should be prayerful, painstaking effort and much patience, to\nanswer the prayer of Christ that His disciples may be one as He [168]\nis one with the Father. The earnest, sincere prayer will be heard\nand the Lord will answer. The Holy Spirit will quicken the mental\nfaculties and there will be a seeing eye to eye. \u201cThe entrance of thy\nwords giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple\u201d (Psalm\n119:130).\nJustification and Christ\u2019s Righteousness Presented \u2014Elder\nE. J. Waggoner had the privilege granted him of speaking plainly and\npresenting his views upon justification by faith and the righteousness\nof Christ in relation to the law. This was no new light, but it was old\nlight placed where it should be in the third angel\u2019s message.... What\nis the burden of that message? John sees a people. He says, \u201cHere is\nthe patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments\nof God, and the faith of Jesus\u201d (Revelation 14:12). This people John\nbeholds just before he sees the Son of man \u201chaving on his head a\ngolden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle\u201d (Verse 14).\nThe faith of Jesus has been overlooked and treated in an indiffer-\nent, careless manner. It has not occupied the prominent position in\nwhich it was revealed to John. Faith in Christ as the sinner\u2019s only\nhope has been largely left out, not only of the discourses given but\nof the religious experience of very many who claim to believe the\nthird angel\u2019s message.\nTruths Ellen White Had Presented Since 1844\u2014At this meet-\ning I bore testimony that the most precious light had been shining\nforth from the Scriptures in the presentation of the great subject of\nthe righteousness of Christ connected with the law, which should be\n152 Selected Messages Book 3\nconstantly kept before the sinner as his only hope of salvation. This\nwas not new light to me, for it had come to me from higher authority\nfor the last forty-four years, and I had presented it to our people by\npen and voice in the testimonies of His Spirit. But very few had re-\nsponded except by assent to the testimonies borne upon this subject.\nThere was altogether too little spoken and written upon this great\nquestion. The discourses of some might be correctly represented as[169]\nlike the offering of Cain\u2014Christless.\nThe Mystery of Godliness\u2014The standard by which to measure\ncharacter is the royal law. The law is the sin detector. By the law\nis the knowledge of sin. But the sinner is constantly being drawn\nto Jesus by the wonderful manifestation of His love in that He\nhumiliated Himself to die a shameful death upon the cross. What\na study is this! Angels have striven, earnestly longed, to look into\nthe wonderful mystery. It is a study that can tax the highest human\nintelligence, that man, fallen, deceived by Satan, taking Satan\u2019s\nside of the question, can be conformed to the image of the Son of\nthe infinite God. That man shall be like Him, that, because of the\nrighteousness of Christ given to man, God will love man\u2014fallen but\nredeemed\u2014even as He loved His Son. Read it right out of the living\noracles.\nThis is the mystery of godliness. This picture is of the highest\nvalue to be placed in every discourse, to be hung in memory\u2019s hall,\nto be uttered by human lips, to be traced by human beings who have\ntasted and known that the Lord is good, to be meditated upon, to be\nthe groundwork of every discourse. There have been dry theories\npresented and precious souls are starving for the bread of life. This\nis not the preaching that is required or that the God of heaven will\naccept, for it is Christless. The divine picture of Christ must be kept\nbefore the people. He is that Angel standing in the sun of heaven.\nHe reflects no shadows. Clothed in the attributes of deity, shrouded\nin the glories of deity, and in the likeness of the infinite God, He\nis to be lifted up before men. When this is kept before the people,\ncreature merit sinks into insignificance. The more the eye looks\nupon Him, the more His life, His lessons, His perfection of character\nare studied, the more sinful and abhorrent will sin appear.\nBy beholding, man can but admire and become more attracted\nto Him, more charmed, and more desirous to be like Jesus until he\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 153\nassimilates to His image and has the mind of Christ. Like Enoch he [170]\nwalks with God. His mind is full of thoughts of Jesus. He is his best\nFriend....\nStudy Jesus Our Pattern\u2014\u201cWherefore, holy brethren, partak-\ners of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of\nour profession, Christ Jesus\u201d (Hebrews 3:1). Study Christ. Study His\ncharacter, feature by feature. He is our Pattern that we are required\nto copy in our lives and our characters, else we fail to represent Jesus,\nbut present to the world a spurious copy. Do not imitate any man,\nfor men are defective in habits, in speech, in manners, in character.\nI present before you the Man Christ Jesus. You must individually\nknow Him as your Saviour before you can study Him as your pattern\nand your example.\nSaid Paul, \u201cI am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is\nthe power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the\nJew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of\nGod revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live\nby faith.... Because that which may be known of God is manifest in\nthem; for God hath shewed it unto them\u201d (Romans 1:16-19).\nGrateful That Minds Were Stirred by God\u2019s Spirit\u2014We felt\ndeeply and solemnly grateful to God that minds were being stirred by\nthe Spirit of God to see Christ in the living oracles and to represent\nHim to the world, but not in words merely. They see the Scripture\nrequirements that all who claim to be followers of Christ are under\nobligation to walk in His footsteps, to be imbued with His Spirit,\nand thus to present to the world Jesus Christ, who came to our world\nto represent the Father.\nIn representing Christ we represent God to our world. \u201cIf any\nman have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his\u201d (Romans 8:9).\nLet us inquire, Are we reflecting in the church and before the world\nthe character of Jesus Christ? A great deal deeper study is required\nof us in searching the Scriptures. Placing the righteousness of Christ [171]\nin the law distinctly reveals God in His true character and reveals\nthe law as holy, just, and good, glorious indeed when seen in its true\ncharacter.\nIf all our ministering brethren could have come to their Bibles\ntogether, with the spirit of Christ, respecting each other, and with\ntrue Christian courtesy, the Lord would have been their instructor.\n154 Selected Messages Book 3\nBut the Lord has no chance to impress minds over which Satan\nhas so great power. Everything that does not harmonize with their\nmind and their human judgment will appear in shadows and dark\noutlines....\nThe Spirit of Many Burdened Ellen White\u2014My burden dur-\ning the meeting was to present Jesus and His love before my brethren,\nfor I saw marked evidences that many had not the spirit of Christ.\nMy mind was kept in peace, stayed upon God, and I felt sad to see\nthat a different spirit had come into the experience of our brother\nministers, and that it was leavening the camp. There was, I knew, a\nremarkable blindness upon the minds of many, that they did not dis-\ncern where the Spirit of God was and what constituted true Christian\nexperience. And to consider that these were the ones who had the\nguardianship of the flock of God was painful. The destitution of true\nfaith, the hands hung down, because not lifted up in sincere prayer!\nSome felt no need of prayer. Their own judgment, they felt,\nwas sufficient, and they had no sense that the enemy of all good\nwas guiding their judgment. They were as soldiers going unarmed\nand unarmored to the battle. Can we marvel that the discourses\nwere spiritless, that the living water of life refused to flow through\nobstructed channels, and that the light of heaven could not penetrate\nthe dense fog of lukewarmness and sinfulness?\nI was able to sleep but a few hours. I was writing all hours of the\nmorning, frequently rising at two and at three A.M. and relieving\nmy mind by writing upon the subjects that were presented before\nme. My heart was pained to see the spirit that controlled some of\nour ministering brethren, and this spirit seemed to be contagious.[172]\nThere was much talking done.\nA Presentation of Truth She Could Endorse\u2014When I stated\nbefore my brethren that I had heard for the first time the views of\nElder E. J. Waggoner, some did not believe me. I stated that I\nhad heard precious truths uttered that I could respond to with all my\nheart, for had not these great and glorious truths, the righteousness of\nChrist and the entire sacrifice made in behalf of man, been imprinted\nindelibly on my mind by the Spirit of God? Has not this subject\nbeen presented in the testimonies again and again? When the Lord\nhad given to my brethren the burden to proclaim this message I felt\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 155\ninexpressibly grateful to God, for I knew it was the message for this\ntime.\nThe third angel\u2019s message is the proclamation of the command-\nments of God and the faith of Jesus Christ. The commandments of\nGod have been proclaimed, but the faith of Jesus Christ has not been\nproclaimed by Seventh-day Adventists as of equal importance, the\nlaw and the gospel going hand in hand. I cannot find language to\nexpress this subject in its fullness.\n\u201cThe faith of Jesus.\u201d It is talked of, but not understood. What\nconstitutes the faith of Jesus, that belongs to the third angel\u2019s mes-\nsage? Jesus becoming our sin-bearer that He might become our\nsin-pardoning Saviour. He was treated as we deserve to be treated.\nHe came to our world and took our sins that we might take His\nrighteousness. And faith in the ability of Christ to save us amply\nand fully and entirely is the faith of Jesus.\nThe only safety for the Israelites was blood upon the doorposts.\nGod said, \u201cWhen I see the blood, I will pass over you\u201d (Exodus\n12:13). All other devices for safety would be without avail. Nothing\nbut the blood on the doorposts would bar the way that the angel\nof death should not enter. There is salvation for the sinner in the\nblood of Jesus Christ alone, which cleanseth us from all sin. The\nman with a cultivated intellect may have vast stores of knowledge,\nhe may engage in theological speculations, he may be great and [173]\nhonored of men and be considered the repository of knowledge, but\nunless he has a saving knowledge of Christ crucified for him, and by\nfaith lays hold of the righteousness of Christ, he is lost. Christ \u201cwas\nwounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities:\nthe chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we\nare healed\u201d (Isaiah 53:5). \u201cSaved by the blood of Jesus Christ,\u201d will\nbe our only hope for time and our song throughout eternity.\nBattling Prejudice and False Accusations \u2014When I plainly\nstated my faith there were many who did not understand me and they\nreported that Sister White had changed; Sister White was influenced\nby her son W. C. White and by Elder A. T. Jones. Of course, such\na statement coming from the lips of those who had known me for\nyears, who had grown up with the third angel\u2019s message and had\nbeen honored by the confidence and faith of our people, must have\ninfluence.\n156 Selected Messages Book 3\nI became the subject of remarks and criticism, but no one of our\nbrethren came to me and made inquiries or sought any explanation\nfrom me. We tried most earnestly to have all our ministering brethren\nrooming in the house meet in an unoccupied room and unite our\nprayers together, but did not succeed in this but two or three times.\nThey chose to go to their rooms and have their conversation and\nprayers by themselves. There did not seem to be any opportunity\nto break down the prejudice that was so firm and determined, no\nchance to remove the misunderstanding in regard to myself, my son,\nand E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones.\nI tried to make another effort. I had that morning at an early\nhour written matter that should come before our brethren, for then\nmy words would not be misstated. Quite a number of our leading\nresponsible men were present, and I deeply regretted that a much\nlarger number were not taken into this council, for some of those\npresent, I knew, began to see things in a different light, and many\nmore would have been benefited had they had the opportunity to\nhear what I had to say. But they did not know and were not benefited[174]\nby my explanations and with the plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d which\nI gave them.\nQuestions were asked at that time. \u201cSister White, do you think\nthat the Lord has any new and increased light for us as a people?\u201d\nI answered, \u201cMost assuredly. I do not only think so, but can speak\nunderstandingly. I know that there is precious truth to be unfolded\nto us if we are the people that are to stand in the day of God\u2019s\npreparation.\u201d\nEllen White Encourages Open-minded Study \u2014Then the\nquestion was asked whether I thought the matter had better drop\nwhere it was, after Brother Waggoner had stated his views of the\nlaw in Galatians. I said, \u201cBy no means. We want all on both sides of\nthe question.\u201d But I stated that the spirit I had seen manifested at the\nmeeting was unreasonable. I should insist that there be a right spirit,\na Christlike spirit, manifested such as Elder E. J. Waggoner had\nshown all through the presentation of his views: and that this matter\nshould not be handled in a debating style. The reason I should urge\nthat this matter should be handled in a Christlike spirit was that there\nshould be no thrust made against their brethren differing with them.\nAs Elder E. J. Waggoner had conducted himself like a Christian\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 157\ngentleman they should do the same, giving the arguments on their\nside of the question in a straightforward manner....\nThe Question of the Law in Galatians Not Vital\u2014The remark\nwas made, \u201cIf our views of Galatians are not correct, then we have\nnot the third angel\u2019s message, and our position goes by the board;\nthere is nothing to our faith.\u201d\nI said, \u201cBrethren, here is the very thing I have been telling you.\nThis statement is not true. It is an extravagant, exaggerated statement.\nIf it is made in the discussion of this question I shall feel if my duty to\nset this matter before all that are assembled, and whether they hear or\nforbear tell them the statement is incorrect. The question at issue is [175]\nnot a vital question and should not be treated as such. The wonderful\nimportance and magnitude of this subject has been exaggerated, and\nfor this reason\u2014through misconception and perverted ideas\u2014we\nsee the spirit that prevails at this meeting, which is unchristlike, and\nwhich we should never see exhibited among brethren. There has\nbeen a spirit of Pharisaism coming in among us which I shall lift my\nvoice against wherever it may be revealed\u201d....\nI could see a great want of wise discrimination and of good\njudgment. The evil of such things has often been presented before\nme. The difference of opinion was made apparent to both believers\nand unbelievers. These things made such an impression upon my\nmind that I felt that my brethren had met with a great change. This\nmatter had been set before me while I was in Europe, in figures and\nsymbols, but the explanation was given me afterwards so that I was\nnot left in the dark in regard to the state of our churches and of our\nministering brethren....\nI returned to my room questioning what was the best course for\nme to pursue. Many hours that night were spent in prayer in regard\nto the law in Galatians. This was a mere mote. Whichever way\nwas in accordance with a \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d my soul would say,\nAmen, and Amen. But the spirit that was controlling our brethren\nwas so unlike the spirit of Jesus, so contrary to the spirit that should\nbe exercised toward each other, it filled my soul with anguish.\nIn the next morning\u2019s meeting for the ministers I had some plain\nthings to say to my brethren, which I dared not withhold. The salt\nhad lost its savor, the fine gold become dim. Spiritual darkness was\nupon the people and many evidenced that they were moved with a\n158 Selected Messages Book 3\npower from beneath, for the result was just such as would be the\ncase when they were not under the illumination of the Spirit of God.\nWhat pages of history were being made by the recording angel!\nThe leaven had indeed done its sharp work, and nearly leavened the[176]\nlump. I had a message of reproof and warning for my brethren, I\nknew. My soul was pressed with anguish. To say these things to\nmy brethren causes me far greater anguish than they caused those\nto whom they were addressed. Through the grace of Christ I expe-\nrienced a divine compelling power to stand before my ministering\nbrethren, in the name of the Lord, hoping and praying that the Lord\nwould open the blind eyes. I was strengthened to say the words\nwhich my secretary took in shorthand.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1888.\nMinneapolis a Proving Ground \u2014The Lord was testing and\nproving His people who had had great light, whether they would\nwalk in it or turn from it under temptation, for but few know what\nmanner of spirit they are of until circumstances shall be of a character\nto test the spirit which prompts to action. In many the natural heart\nis a controlling power, and yet they do not suppose that pride and\nprejudice are entertained as cherished guests, and work in the words\nand actions against light and truth. Our brethren who have occupied\nleading positions in the work and the cause of God should have been\nso closely connected with the Source of all light that they would not\ncall light darkness and darkness light....\nRighteousness by Faith Does Not Downgrade the Law \u2014\nHolding up Christ as our only source of strength, presenting His\nmatchless love in having the guilt of the sins of men charged to His\naccount and His own righteousness imputed to man, in no case does\naway with the law or detracts from its dignity. Rather, it places it\nwhere the correct light shines upon and glorifies it. This is done\nonly through the light reflected from the cross of Calvary. The law is\ncomplete and full in the great plan of salvation, only as it is presented\nin the light shining from the crucified and risen Saviour. This can\nbe only spiritually discerned. It kindles in the heart of the beholder\nardent faith, hope, and joy that Christ is his righteousness. This joy\nis only for those who love and keep the words of Jesus, which are[177]\nthe words of God.\nWere my brethren in the light the words that the Lord gave me\nfor them would find a response in the hearts of those for whom\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 159\nI labored. As I saw that the hearts with which I longed to be in\nharmony were padlocked by prejudice and unbelief, I thought best\nfor me to leave them. My purpose was to go from Minneapolis the\nfirst of the week....\nI wished to meditate, to pray, [that I might know] in what manner\nwe could work to present the subject of sin and atonement in the\nBible light before the people. They were greatly needing this kind\nof instruction that they might give the light to others and have the\nblessed privilege of being workers together with God in gathering in\nand bringing home the sheep of His fold. What power must we have\nfrom God that icy hearts, having only a legal religion, should see\nthe better things provided for them\u2014Christ and His righteousness!\nA life-giving message was needed to give life to the dry bones.\u2014\nManuscript 24, 1888.\nEllen White\u2019s Appraisal on the Closing Day\n(Written to a member of her home family, November 4, 1888).\nOur meeting [The Minneapolis General Conference session] is\nclosed. I have on last Sabbath given my last discourse. There seemed\nfor the first time to be considerable feeling in the congregation. I\ncalled them forward for prayers although the church was densely\npacked. Quite a number came forward. The Lord gave me the spirit\nof supplication and His blessing came upon me. I did not go out to\nmeeting this morning. This has been a most laborious meeting for\nWillie, and I have had to watch at every point lest there should be\nmoves made, resolutions passed, that would prove detrimental to the\nfuture work.\nI have spoken nearly twenty times with great freedom and we\nbelieve that this meeting will result in great good. We know not the\nfuture, but we feel that Jesus stands at the helm and we shall not [178]\nbe shipwrecked. My courage and faith have been good and have\nnot failed me, notwithstanding we have had the hardest and most\nincomprehensible tug of war we have ever had among our people.\nThe matter cannot be explained by pen unless I should write many,\nmany pages; so I had better not undertake the job.\n160 Selected Messages Book 3\nElder Olsen is to be president of the General Conference and\nBrother Dan Jones, of Kansas, is to help him. Elder Haskell will\nserve until Brother Olsen shall come from Europe. [In the absence\nof George I. Butler, president of the General Conference, Elder\nHaskell chaired the General Conference session. Shortly after the\nclose of the session, W. C. White was asked to serve as acting\nGeneral Conference president, which he did for nearly six months.] I\ncannot tell what the future may reveal, but we shall remain for about\nfour weeks in Battle Creek and get out a testimony that should come\nout just now without delay. Then we can see how matters move at\nthe great center of the work. We are determined to do all we can in\nthe fear of God to help our people in this emergency.\nA sick man\u2019s mind has had a controlling power over the General\nConference Committee and the ministers have been the shadow and\necho of Elder Butler about as long as it is healthy and for the good\nof the cause. Envy, evil surmisings, jealousies have been working\nlike leaven until the whole lump seemed to be leavened....\nToday, Sunday, I have not attended meeting, but have had to visit\nconsiderably. I am grateful to God for the strength and freedom and\npower of His spirit in bearing my testimony, although it has made\nthe least impression upon many minds than at any period before in\nmy history. Satan has seemed to have power to hinder my work in\na wonderful degree, but I tremble to think what would have been\nin this meeting if we had not been here. God would have worked\nin some way to prevent this spirit brought to the meeting, having a\ncontrolling power. But we are not the least discouraged. We trust\nin the Lord God of Israel. The truth will triumph and we mean to[179]\ntriumph with it.\nWe think of you all at home and would be pleased to be with\nyou, but our wishes are not to be consulted. The Lord is our Leader,\nlet Him direct our course and we will follow where He leads the\nway.\u2014Letter 82, 1888.\nTwo Excerpts From Minneapolis Sermons\n[Ellen White spoke twenty times at Minneapolis, but did not there\nenter into presentations on righteousness by faith. Rather, she\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 161\nlabored to lead men and women to open their minds to Bible-based\ntruth.]\nNow what we want to present is, how you may advance in the\ndivine life. We hear many excuses: I cannot live up to this or that.\nWhat do you mean by this or that? Do you mean that it was an\nimperfect sacrifice that was made for the fallen race upon Calvary,\nthat there is not sufficient grace and power granted us that we may\nwork away from our own natural defects and tendencies, that it was\nnot a whole Saviour that was given us?\nOr do you mean to cast reproach upon God? Well, you say, It\nwas Adam\u2019s sin. You say, I am not guilty of that, and I am not\nresponsible for his guilt and fall. Here all these natural tendencies\nare in me, and I am not to blame if I act out these natural tendencies.\nWho is to blame? Is God?\nWhy did God let Satan have this power over human nature?\nThese are accusations against the God of heaven, and He will give\nyou an opportunity, if you want it, of finally bringing your accu-\nsations against Him. Then He will bring His accusations against\nyou when you are brought into His court of judgment.\u2014Manuscript\n8, 1888, Sabbath, October 20, 1888. [Her talks that were reported\nappear as a 60-page appendix (pp. 242-302) in the book Through\nCrisis to Victory.\u2014Compilers.]\nIf God could have changed His law to meet man in his fallen\ncondition, Christ need not have come to this world. Because the law\nwas immutable, unchangeable, God sent his only begotten Son to\ndie for the fallen race. But did the Saviour take upon Himself the\nguilt of human beings and impute to them His righteousness in order [180]\nthat they might continue to violate the precepts of Jehovah? No, no!\nChrist came because there was no possibility of man\u2019s keeping the\nlaw in his own strength. He came to bring him strength to obey the\nprecepts of the law. And the sinner, repenting of his transgression,\nmay come to God and say, \u201cO Father, I plead forgiveness through\nthe merits of a crucified and risen Saviour.\u201d God will accept all who\ncome to Him in the name of Jesus.\u2014Manuscript 17, 1888, Sunday,\nOctober 21, 1888.\n162 Selected Messages Book 3\nThree Months After Minneapolis\nWhen We Do Our Best \u2014Thank God it is not too late for\nwrongs to be righted. Christ looks at the spirit, and when He sees us\ncarrying our burden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our\nshortcomings. When we do our best, He becomes our righteousness.\nIt takes every ray of light that God sends to us to make us the light\nof the world.\u2014Letter 22, 1889 (Published in Selected Messages\n1:368.)\nThe Reception in the Field of the Message of Righteousness by\nFaith\nSpecial meetings began at South Lancaster on Friday, January 11\n[1889]. We were glad to find the church well filled with those who\nhad come to receive benefit from the meetings. [This was among\nthe first meetings in which Ellen White participated in presenting\nthe message of righteousness by faith in the field subsequent to the\nMinneapolis Conference. Through 1889 she frequently led out in\ncarrying the message to the churches. Some of her sermons were\nreported, as was the one at Ottawa, Kansas, on May 11. This typical\nsermon is published in Faith and Works, 63-79.] ... Delegates were\npresent from Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other States.\nWe realized that there was a work to be done in setting things in\norder, which man\u2019s best efforts could not accomplish without the aid\nof God. Our hearts were drawn out in earnest supplication to God\nthat He would work in our behalf....\nWe felt burdened for those who had been bearing the message[181]\nof truth to others, lest they should close their hearts to some of the\nprecious rays of heaven\u2019s light that God has sent them. Jesus rejoiced\nwhen His followers received His messages of truth....\nOn Sabbath afternoon, many hearts were touched, and many\nsouls were fed on the bread that cometh down from heaven. After\nthe discourse we enjoyed a precious social meeting. The Lord came\nvery near, and convicted souls of their great need of His grace and\nlove. We felt the necessity of presenting Christ as a Saviour who\nwas not afar off, but nigh at hand. When the Spirit of God begins to\nwork upon the hearts of men, the fruit is seen in confession of sin\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 163\nand restitution for wrongs. All through the meetings, as the people\nsought to draw nearer to God, they brought forth works meet for\nrepentance by confessing one to another where they had wronged\neach other by word or act....\nThere were many, even among the ministers, who saw the truth\nas it is in Jesus in a light in which they had never before reviewed it.\nThey saw the Saviour as a sin-pardoning Saviour, and the truth as the\nsanctifier of the soul. \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just\nto forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\u201d...\nMany Hold Distorted Views \u2014There are many who seem to\nfeel that they have a great work to do themselves before they can\ncome to Christ for His salvation. They seem to think that Jesus will\ncome in at the very last of their struggle, and give them help by\nputting the finishing touch to their lifework. It seems difficult for\nthem to understand that Christ is a complete Saviour, and able to\nsave to the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. They lose\nsight of the fact that Christ Himself is \u201cthe way, the truth, and the\nlife.\u201d When we individually rest upon Christ, with full assurance of\nfaith, trusting alone to the efficacy of His blood to cleanse from all\nsin, we shall have peace in believing that what God has promised\nHe is able to perform....\nThe Very Message Presented \u2014As our brethren and sisters [182]\nopened their hearts to the light, they obtained a better knowledge of\nwhat constitutes faith. The Lord was very precious; He was ready to\nstrengthen His people. The meetings continued a week beyond their\nfirst appointment. The school was dismissed, and all made earnest\nwork of seeking the Lord. Elder Jones came from Boston, and la-\nbored most earnestly for the people, speaking twice and sometimes\nthree times a day. The flock of God were fed with soul-nourishing\nfood. The very message the Lord has sent to the people of this time\nwas presented in the discourses. Meetings were in progress from\nearly morning till night, and the results were highly satisfactory.\nBoth students and teachers have shared largely in the blessing\nof God. The deep movings of the Spirit of God have been felt upon\nalmost every heart. The general testimony was borne by those who\nattended the meeting that they had obtained an experience beyond\nanything they had known before. They testified their joy that Christ\nhad forgiven their sins. Their hearts were filled with thanksgiving\n164 Selected Messages Book 3\nand praise to God. Sweet peace was in their souls. They loved\neveryone, and felt that they could rest in the love of God.\nI have never seen a revival work go forward with such thorough-\nness, and yet remain so free from all undue excitement.\nThere were many who testified that as the searching truths had\nbeen presented, they had been convicted in the light of the law as\ntransgressors. They had been trusting in their own righteousness.\nNow they saw it as filthy rags, in comparison with the righteousness\nof Christ, which is alone acceptable to God.\nWhile they had not been open transgressors, they saw themselves\ndepraved and degraded in heart. They had substituted other gods\nin the place of their heavenly Father. They had struggled to refrain\nfrom sin, but had trusted in their own strength. We should go to Jesus\njust as we are, confess our sins, and cast our helpless souls upon\nour compassionate Redeemer.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 5,\n1889.\nNeed for a Proper Concept of Righteousness by Faith[183]\nBy invitation I made some remarks in the ministers\u2019 tent, [Coun-\nsel to ministers at the Colorado camp meeting, September 13, 1889,\non presenting righteousness by faith.] To the ministers. We talked\nsome in regard to the best plans to be arranged to educate the people\nhere upon this very ground in reference to home religion.\nMany people seem to be ignorant of what constitutes faith. Many\ncomplain of darkness and discouragements. I asked, \u201cAre your\nfaces turned toward Jesus? Are you beholding Him, the Sun of\nRighteousness? You need plainly to define to the churches the\nmatter of faith and entire dependence upon the righteousness of\nChrist. In your talks and prayers there has been so little dwelling\nupon Christ, His matchless love, His great sacrifice made in our\nbehalf, that Satan has nearly eclipsed the views we should have and\nmust have of Jesus Christ. We must trust less in human beings for\nspiritual help and more, far more, in approaching Jesus Christ as\nour Redeemer. We may dwell with a determined purpose on the\nheavenly attributes of Jesus Christ; we may talk of His love, we may\ntell and sing of His mercies, we may make Him our own personal\nSaviour. Then we are one with Christ. We love that which Christ\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 165\nloved, we hate sin, that which Christ hated. These things must be\ntalked of, dwelt upon.\u201d\nI address the ministers. Lead the people along step by step,\ndwelling upon Christ\u2019s efficiency until, by a living faith, they see\nJesus as He is\u2014see Him in His fullness, a sin-pardoning Saviour,\nOne who can pardon all our transgressions. It is by beholding that\nwe become changed into His likeness. This is present truth. We\nhave talked the law. This is right. But we have only casually lifted\nup Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour.\nWe are to keep before the mind the sin-pardoning Saviour. But [184]\nwe are to present Him in His true position\u2014coming to die to magnify\nthe law of God and make it honorable, and yet to justify the sinner\nwho shall depend wholly upon the merits of the blood of a crucified\nand risen Saviour. This is not made plain.\nThe soul-saving message, the third angel\u2019s message, is the mes-\nsage to be given to the world. The commandments of God and the\nfaith of Jesus are both important, immensely important, and must be\ngiven with equal force and power. The first part of the message has\nbeen dwelt upon mostly, the last part casually. The faith of Jesus is\nnot comprehended. We must talk it, we must live it, we must pray it,\nand educate the people to bring this part of the message into their\nhome life. \u201cLet this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus\u201d\n(Philippians 2:5).\nChrist-filled Discourses Needed\u2014There have been entire dis-\ncourses, dry and Christless, in which Jesus has scarcely been named.\nThe speaker\u2019s heart is not subdued and melted by the love of Je-\nsus. He dwells upon dry theories. No great impression is made.\nThe speaker has not the divine unction, and how can he move the\nhearts of the people? We need to repent and be converted\u2014yes, the\npreacher converted. The people must have Jesus lifted up before\nthem, and they must be entreated to \u201cLook and live.\u201d\nWhy are our lips so silent upon the subject of Christ\u2019s righteous-\nness and His love for the world? Why do we not give to the people\nthat which will revive and quicken them into a new life? The apostle\nPaul is filled with transport and adoration as he declares, \u201cWithout\ncontroversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest\nin the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto\n166 Selected Messages Book 3\nthe Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory\u201d (1\nTimothy 3:16).\n\u201cLet this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who,\nbeing in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with\nGod: but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form\nof a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found[185]\nin fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto\ndeath, even the death of the cross.... That at the name of Jesus every\nknee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things\nunder the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus\nChrist is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\u201d (Philippians 2:5-11).\n\u201cIn whom we have redemption through his blood, even the\nforgiveness of sins: who is the image of the invisible God, the\nfirstborn of every creature: for by him were all things created, that\nare in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether\nthey be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things\nwere created by him, and for him: and he is before all things, and by\nhim all things consist\u201d (Colossians 1:14-17).\nThis is the grand and heavenly theme that has in a large degree\nbeen left out of the discourses because Christ is not formed within\nthe human mind. And Satan has had his way that it shall be thus,\nthat Christ should not be the theme of contemplation and adoration.\nThis name, so powerful, so essential, should be on every tongue.\n\u201cWhereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of\nGod which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God; even the\nmystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but\nnow is made manifest to his saints: to whom God would make known\nwhat is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles;\nwhich is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we preach, warning\nevery man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may\npresent every man perfect in Christ Jesus: whereunto I also labor,\nstriving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily\u201d\n(Colossians 1:25-29).\nHere is the work of the ministers of Christ. Because this work\nhas not been done, because Christ and His character, His words,\nand His work have not been brought before the people, the religious\nstate of the churches testifies against their teachers. The churches[186]\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 167\nare ready to die because little of Christ is presented. They have not\nspiritual life and spiritual discernment.\nFear of the Message of Righteousness by Faith\u2014The teachers\nof the people have not themselves become acquainted by living\nexperience with the Source of their dependence and their strength.\nAnd when the Lord raises up men and sends them with the very\nmessage for this time to give to the people\u2014a message which is\nnot a new truth, but the very same that Paul taught, that Christ\nHimself taught\u2014it is to them a strange doctrine. They begin to\ncaution the people\u2014who are ready to die because they have not\nbeen strengthened with the lifting up of Christ before them\u2014\u201cDo\nnot be too hasty. Better wait, and not take up with this matter until\nyou know more about it.\u201d And the ministers preach the same dry\ntheories, when the people need fresh manna.\nThe character of Christ is an infinitely perfect character, and He\nmust be lifted up, He must be brought prominently into view, for\nHe is the power, the might, the sanctification and righteousness of\nall who believe in Him. The men who have had a Pharisaical spirit,\nthink if they hold to the good old theories, and have no part in the\nmessage sent of God to His people, they will be in a good and safe\nposition. So thought the Pharisees of old, and their example should\nwarn ministers off that self-satisfied ground.\nPresent Inspiring Themes of the Gospel\u2014We need a power to\ncome upon us now and stir us up to diligence and earnest faith. Then,\nbaptized with the Holy Spirit, we shall have Christ formed within,\nthe hope of glory. Then we will exhibit Christ as the divine object of\nour faith and our love. We will talk of Christ, we will pray to Christ\nand about Christ. We will praise His holy name. We will present\nbefore the people His miracles, His self-denial, His self-sacrifice,\nHis sufferings, and His crucifixion, His resurrection and triumphant\nascension. These are the inspiring themes of the gospel, to awaken [187]\nlove and intense fervor in every heart. Here are the treasures of\nwisdom and knowledge, a fountain inexhaustible. The more you\nseek of this experience, the greater will be the value of your life.\nThe living water may be drawn from the fountain and yet there\nis no diminution of the supply. Ministers of the gospel would be\npowerful men if they set the Lord always before them and devoted\ntheir time to the study of His adorable character. If they did this,\n168 Selected Messages Book 3\nthere would be no apostasies, there would be none separated from\nthe conference because they have, by their licentious practices, dis-\ngraced the cause of God and put Jesus to an open shame. The powers\nof every minister of the gospel should be employed to educate the be-\nlieving churches to receive Christ by faith as their personal Saviour,\nto take Him into their very lives and make Him their Pattern to learn\nof Jesus, believe in Jesus, and exalt Jesus. The minister should\nhimself dwell on the character of Christ. He should ponder the\ntruth, and meditate upon the mysteries of redemption, especially the\nmediatorial work of Christ for this time.\nDwell More on the Incarnation and Atonement\u2014If Christ is\nall and in all to every one of us, why are not His incarnation and\nHis atoning sacrifice dwelt upon more in the churches? Why are\nnot hearts and tongues employed in the Redeemer\u2019s praise? This\nwill be the employment of the powers of the redeemed through the\nceaseless ages of eternity.\nWe need to have a living connection with God ourselves in order\nto teach Jesus. Then we can give the living personal experience of\nwhat Christ is to us by experience and faith. We have received Christ\nand with divine earnestness we can tell that which is an abiding\npower with us. The people must be drawn to Christ. Prominence\nmust be given to His saving efficacy.\nThe true learners, sitting at Christ\u2019s feet, discover the precious\ngems of truth uttered by our Saviour, and will discern their signif-\nicance and appreciate their value. And more and more, as they\nbecome humble and teachable, will their understanding be opened[188]\nto discover wondrous things out of His law, for Christ has presented\nthem in clear, sharp lines.\nThe doctrine of grace and salvation through Jesus Christ is a\nmystery to a large share of those whose names are upon the church\nbooks. If Christ were upon the earth speaking to His people, He\nwould reproach them for their slowness of comprehension. He would\nsay to the slow and uncomprehending, \u201cI have left in your possession\ntruths which concern your salvation, of which you do not suspect\nthe value.\u201d\nOh, that it might be said of ministers who are preaching to the\npeople and to the churches, \u201cThen opened he their understanding,\nthat they might understand the scriptures\u201d! (Luke 24:45). I tell you\nEllen G. White Reports on the Minneapolis Conference 169\nin the fear of God that up to this time, the Bible truths connected\nwith the great plan of redemption are but feebly understood. The\ntruth will be continually unfolding, expanding, and developing, for\nit is divine, like its Author.\nHow Jesus Taught the People \u2014Jesus did not give full com-\nments or continued discourses upon doctrines, but He oft spoke\nin short sentences, as one sowing the heavenly grains of doctrines\nlike pearls which need to be gathered up by a discerning laborer.\nThe doctrines of faith and grace are brought to view everywhere He\ntaught. Oh, why do not ministers give to the churches the very food\nwhich will give them spiritual health and vigor? The result will be a\nrich experience in practical obedience to the Word of God. Why do\nthe ministers not strengthen the things that remain that are ready to\ndie?\nWhen about to leave His disciples, Christ was in search of the\ngreatest comfort He could give them. He promised them the Holy\nSpirit\u2014the Comforter\u2014to combine with man\u2019s human effort. What\npromise is less experienced, less fulfilled to the church, than the\npromise of the Holy Spirit? When this blessing, which would bring\nall blessings in its train, is dropped out, the sure result is spiritual\ndrought. This is the reproach that meets the sermonizer. The church [189]\nmust arise and no longer be content with the meager dew.\nOur Need for the Holy Spirit\u2014Oh, why do our church mem-\nbers stop short of their privileges? They are not personally alive to\nthe necessity of the influence of the Spirit of God. The church may,\nlike Mary, say, \u201cThey have taken away my Lord, and I know not\nwhere they have laid him\u201d (John 20:13).\nMinisters preaching present truth will assent to the necessity of\nthe influence of the Spirit of God in the conviction of sin and the con-\nversion of souls, and this influence must attend the preaching of the\nWord, but they do not feel its importance sufficiently to have a deep\nand practical knowledge of the same. The scantiness of the grace\nand power of the divine influence of the truth upon their own hearts\nprevents them from discerning spiritual things and from presenting\nits positive necessity upon the church. So they go crippling along,\ndwarfed in religious growth, because they have in their ministry a\nlegal religion. The power of the grace of God is not felt to be a\nliving, effectual necessity, an abiding principle.\n170 Selected Messages Book 3\nOh, that all could see this and embrace the message given them\nof God! He has raised up His servants to present truth that, because\nit involves lifting the cross, has been lost sight of, and is buried\nbeneath the rubbish of formality. It must be rescued and be reset in\nthe framework of present truth. Its claims must be asserted, and its\nposition given it in the third angel\u2019s message.\nLet the many ministers of Christ sanctify a fast, call a solemn as-\nsembly, and seek God while He is to be found. Call upon Him while\nyou are now lying at the foot of the cross of Calvary. Divest your-\nselves of all pride and as representative guardians of the churches,\nweep between the porch and the altar, and cry \u201cSpare Thy people,\nLord, and give not Thine heritage to reproach. Take from us what\nThou wilt, but withhold not Thy Holy Spirit from us, Thy people.\u201d\nPray, oh, pray for the outpouring of the Spirit of God!\u2014Manuscript\n27, 1889.\nChapter 22\u2014Emphasis on Salvation [190]\nTheme\u20141890-1908\nThe Provision for Salvation\u2014Penances, mortifications of the\nflesh, constant confession of sin, without sincere repentance; fasts,\nfestivals, and outward observances, unaccompanied by true devo-\ntion\u2014all these are of no value whatever. The sacrifice of Christ is\nsufficient; He made a whole, efficacious offering to God; and human\neffort without the merit of Christ, is worthless. We not only dishonor\nGod by taking this course but we destroy our present and future\nusefulness. A failure to appreciate the value of the offering of Christ,\nhas a debasing influence; it blights our expectations, and makes\nus fall short of our privileges; it leads us to receive unsound and\nperilous theories concerning the salvation that has been purchased\nfor us at infinite cost. The plan of salvation is not understood to be\nthat through which divine power is brought to man in order that his\nhuman effort may be wholly successful.\nTo be pardoned in the way that Christ pardons, is not only to\nbe forgiven, but to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The Lord\nsays, \u201cA new heart will I give unto thee.\u201d The image of Christ is to\nbe stamped upon the very mind, heart, and soul. The apostle says,\n\u201cBut we have the mind of Christ\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:16). Without the\ntransforming process which can come alone through divine power, [191]\nthe original propensities to sin are left in the heart in all their strength,\nto forge new chains, to impose a slavery that can never be broken by\nhuman power. But men can never enter heaven with their old tastes,\ninclinations, idols, ideas, and theories. Heaven would be no place of\njoy to them; for everything would be in collision with their tastes,\nappetites, and inclinations, and painfully opposed to their natural\nand cultivated traits of character.\nHappiness is the result of holiness and conformity to the will of\nGod. Those who would be saints in heaven must first be saints upon\nthe earth; for when we leave this earth, we shall take our character\nwith us, and this will be simply taking with us some of the elements\n171\n172 Selected Messages Book 3\nof heaven imparted to us through the righteousness of Christ.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, August 19, 1890.\nJustification and Sanctification Accomplished Through\nFaith\u20141890\u2014When through repentance and faith we accept Christ\nas our Saviour, the Lord pardons our sins, and remits the penalty\nprescribed for the transgression of the law. The sinner then stands\nbefore God as a just person; he is taken into favor with Heaven, and\nthrough the Spirit has fellowship with the Father and the Son.\nThen there is yet another work to be accomplished, and this is of\na progressive nature. The soul is to be sanctified through the truth.\nAnd this also is accomplished through faith. For it is only by the\ngrace of Christ, which we receive through faith, that the character\ncan be transformed.\nIt is important that we understand clearly the nature of faith.\nThere are many who believe that Christ is the Saviour of the world,\nthat the gospel is true and reveals the plan of salvation, yet they do\nnot possess saving faith. They are intellectually convinced of the\ntruth, but this is not enough; in order to be justified, the sinner must\nhave that faith that appropriates the merits of Christ to his own soul.\nWe read that the devils \u201cbelieve, and tremble,\u201d but their belief does[192]\nnot bring them justification, neither will the belief of those who give\na merely intellectual assent to the truths of the Bible bring them the\nbenefits of salvation. This belief fails of reaching the vital point, for\nthe truth does not engage the heart or transform the character.\nIn genuine, saving faith, there is trust in God, through the belief\nin the great atoning sacrifice made by the Son of God on Calvary.\nIn Christ, the justified believer beholds his only hope and deliverer.\nBelief may exist without trust, but confidence born of trust cannot\nexist without faith. Every sinner brought to a knowledge of the\nsaving power of Christ, will make manifest this trust in greater\ndegree as he advances in experience.\u2014The Signs of the Times,\nNovember 3, 1890.\nResisting Temptation\u20141891\u2014Many seem to think that it is\nimpossible not to fall under temptation, that they have no power\nto overcome, and they sin against God with their lips, talking dis-\ncouragement and doubt, instead of faith and courage. Christ was\ntempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin. He said, \u201cThe\nprince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.\u201d What does\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 173\nthis mean? It means that the prince of evil could find no vantage\nground in Christ for his temptation; and so it may be with us.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, May 19, 1891.\nPerfection Not Reached by One Bound\u20141891\u2014We are look-\ning beyond time; we are looking to eternity. We are trying to live\nin such a way that Christ can say, \u201cWell done, good and faithful\nservant.\u201d Let us live, every one of us, in that way. We may make\nmistakes; we may err; but God will not leave us in error. \u201cIf we sin\nwe have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.\u201d\nThere is hope for us; we are prisoners of hope.\nLet us grasp the rich promises of God. The garden of God is full\nof rich promises. Oh, let us gather them; let us take them home; let\nus show that we believe in God. Let us take Him at His word; let\nnot one of us be found distrusting God or doubting Him. [193]\nLet us be growing Christians. We are not to stand still. We are to\nbe in advance today of what we were yesterday; every day learning\nto be more trustful, more fully relying upon Jesus. Thus we are to\ngrow up. You do not at one bound reach perfection; sanctification is\nthe work of a lifetime....\nI remember in 1843 a man and his wife ... who expected the\nLord to come in 1844, and they were waiting and watching. And\nevery day they would pray to God; before they would bid each other\ngoodnight, they would say, \u201cIt may be the Lord will come when we\nare asleep, and we want to be ready.\u201d The husband would ask his\nwife if he had said a word during the day that she had thought was\nnot in accordance with the truth and the faith which they professed,\nand then she would ask him the same question. Then they would\nbow before the Lord and ask Him if they had sinned in thought or\nword or action, and if so that He would forgive that transgression.\nNow we want just such simplicity as this.\nYou want to be like little children, hanging upon the merits of a\ncrucified and risen Saviour, and then you will be fortified. How? The\nangels of God will be around you as a wall of fire. The righteousness\nof Christ, which you claim, goes before you, and the glory of God is\nyour rearward. God sanctify the tongues; God sanctify the thoughts;\nGod sanctify our minds, that we may dwell upon heavenly themes,\nand then that we may impart that knowledge and light to others.\nThere is great advancement for us, and do not stop here. May God\n174 Selected Messages Book 3\nhelp you to make the most of your responsibilities.\u2014Manuscript 9,\n1891.\nJustification Explained\u20141891 \u2014Justification by faith is to\nmany a mystery. A sinner is justified by God when he repents of his\nsins. He sees Jesus upon the cross of Calvary. Why all this suffering?\nThe law of Jehovah has been broken. The law of God\u2019s government\nin heaven and earth has been transgressed, and the penalty of sin\nis pronounced to be death. But \u201cGod so loved the world, that he[194]\ngave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d Oh, what love, what matchless\nlove! Christ, the Son of God, dying for guilty man!\nThe sinner views the spirituality of the law of God and its eternal\nobligations. He sees the love of God in providing a substitute and\nsurety for guilty man, and that substitute is One equal with God.\nThis display of grace in the gift of salvation to the world fills the\nsinner with amazement. This love of God to man breaks every bar-\nrier down. He comes to the cross, which has been placed midway\nbetween divinity and humanity, and repents of his sins of transgres-\nsion, because Christ has been drawing him to Himself. He does not\nexpect the law to cleanse him from sin, for there is no pardoning\nquality in the law to save the transgressors of the law. He looks to\nthe atoning Sacrifice as his only hope, through repentance toward\nGod\u2014because the laws of His government have been broken\u2014and\nfaith toward our Lord Jesus Christ as the One who can save and\ncleanse the sinner from every transgression.\nThe mediatorial work of Christ commenced with the commence-\nment of human guilt and suffering and misery, as soon as man\nbecame a transgressor. The law was not abolished to save man and\nbring him into union with God. But Christ assumed the office of\nhis surety and deliverer in becoming sin for man, that man might\nbecome the righteousness of God in and through Him who was one\nwith the Father. Sinners can be justified by God only when He par-\ndons their sins, remits the punishment they deserve, and treats them\nas though they were really just and had not sinned, receiving them\ninto divine favor and treating them as if they were righteous. They\nare justified alone through the imputed righteousness of Christ. The\nFather accepts the Son, and through the atoning sacrifice of His Son\naccepts the sinner.\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 175\nA General Faith Is Not Enough\u2014A general faith is entertained\nby many, and their assent is given that Christianity is the only hope\nfor perishing souls. But to believe this intellectually is not sufficient [195]\nto the saving of the soul....\nThere will be need not only of faith but of a trust in God. This is\nthe true faith of Abraham, a faith which produced fruits. \u201cAbraham\nbelieved God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness\u201d (James\n2:23). When God told him to offer his son as a sacrifice it was the\nsame voice that had spoken telling him to leave his country and go\ninto a land which God would show him. Abraham was saved by\nfaith in Christ as verily as the sinner is saved by faith in Christ today.\nThe faith that justifies always produces first true repentance, and\nthen good works, which are the fruit of that faith. There is no saving\nfaith that does not produce good fruit. God gave Christ to our world\nto become the sinner\u2019s substitute. The moment true faith in the\nmerits of the costly atoning sacrifice is exercised, claiming Christ as\na personal Saviour, that moment the sinner is justified before God,\nbecause he is pardoned.\u2014MS 46, 1891\nHow to Overcome\u20141891 \u2014John pointed the people to the\nLamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world. He said,\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d\nThere is a great deal in that \u201ctaketh away.\u201d The question is, Shall\nwe keep on sinning as though it were an impossibility for us to\novercome? How are we to overcome? As Christ overcame, and that\nis the only way. He prayed to His heavenly Father. We can do the\nsame.... When tempted to speak wrong and do wrong resist Satan\nand say, I will not surrender my will to your control. I will cooperate\nwith divine power and through grace be conqueror.\u2014Manuscript 83,\n1891.\nChrist Makes Up for Our Unavoidable Deficiencies\u20141891\u2014\nJesus loves His children, even if they err. They belong to Jesus and\nwe are to treat them as the purchase of the blood of Jesus Christ. Any\nunreasonable course pursued toward them is written in the books as\nagainst Jesus Christ. He keeps His eye upon them, and when they\ndo their best, calling upon God for His help, be assured the service [196]\nwill be accepted, although imperfect.\nJesus is perfect. Christ\u2019s righteousness is imputed unto them,\nand He will say, \u201cTake away the filthy garments from him and clothe\n176 Selected Messages Book 3\nhim with change of raiment.\u201d Jesus makes up for our unavoidable\ndeficiencies. Where Christians are faithful to each other, true and\nloyal to the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host, never betraying trusts into\nthe enemy\u2019s hands, they will be transformed into Christ\u2019s character.\nJesus will abide in their hearts by faith.\u2014Letter 17a, 1891 (See also\na similar statement made in 1885 in Faith and Works, 50.)\nFlee to Christ as Soon as Sin Is Committed\u20141892\u2014Many do\nnot pray. They feel under condemnation for sin, and they think they\nmust not come to God until they have done something to merit His\nfavor or until God has forgotten about their transgressions. They say,\n\u201cI cannot hold up holy hands before God without wrath or doubting,\nand therefore I cannot come.\u201d So they remain away from Christ, and\nare committing sin all the time in so doing, for without Him you can\ndo nothing but evil.\nJust as soon as you commit sin, you should flee to the throne of\ngrace, and tell Jesus all about it. You should be filled with sorrow for\nsin, because through sin you have weakened your own spirituality,\ngrieved the heavenly angels, and wounded and bruised the loving\nheart of your Redeemer. When you have asked Jesus in contrition\nof soul for His forgiveness, believe that He has forgiven you. Do\nnot doubt His divine mercy or refuse the comfort of His infinite\nlove.\u2014The Bible Echo, February 1, 1892 (Discourse at Melbourne,\nAustralia, December 19, 1891.)\nWhat If We Sin After We Have Been Forgiven?\u20141892 \u2014It\nis the Holy Spirit that imparts repentance to us. Jesus draws us to\nHimself through the agency of His divine Spirit; and through faith\nin His blood we are cleansed from sin: \u201cfor the blood of Jesus Christ[197]\nhis Son, cleanseth us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:7). \u201cIf we confess our\nsins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us\nfrom all unrighteousness\u201d (Verse 9).\nBut suppose that we sin after we have been forgiven, after we\nhave become the children of God, then need we despair?\u2014No:\nfor John writes: \u201cMy little children, these things I write unto you,\nthat ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with\nthe Father, Jesus Christ the righteous\u201d (chap. 2:1). Jesus is in the\nheavenly courts, pleading with the Father in our behalf. He presents\nour prayers, mingling with them the precious incense of His own\nmerit, that our prayers may be acceptable to the Father. He puts the\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 177\nfragrance into our prayers, and the Father hears us because we ask\nfor the very things which we need, and we become to others a savor\nof life unto life.\nJesus came to suffer in our behalf, that He might impart to us\nHis righteousness. There is but one way of escape for us, and that is\nfound only in becoming partakers of the divine nature.\nBut many say that Jesus was not like us, that He was not as we\nare in the world, that He was divine, and that we cannot overcome as\nHe overcame. But Paul writes, \u201cVerily he took not on him the nature\nof angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in\nall things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he\nmight be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to\nGod, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he\nhimself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that\nare tempted\u201d (Hebrews 2:16-18). \u201cFor we have not an high priest\nwhich cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was\nin all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore\ncome boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and\nfind grace to help in time of need\u201d (chap. 4:15, 16). Jesus says, \u201cTo\nhim that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even\nas I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne\u201d [198]\n(Revelation 3:21).\nJesus encircled the race with His humanity, and united divinity\nwith humanity; thus moral power is brought to man through the\nmerits of Jesus. Those who profess His name through His grace are\nto sanctify themselves that they may exert a sanctifying influence on\nall with whom they associate.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 1,\n1892.\nNo Time to Fold Our Hands\u20141892\u2014As we come to feel our\nutter reliance upon Christ for salvation, are we to fold our hands, and\nsay, \u201cI have nothing to do; I am saved; Jesus has done it all\u201d?\u2014No,\nwe are to put forth every energy that we may become partakers of the\ndivine nature. We are to be continually watching, waiting, praying,\nand working.\nBut do all that we may, we cannot pay a ransom for our souls.\nWe can do nothing to originate faith, for faith is the gift of God;\nneither can we perfect it, for Christ is the finisher of our faith. It is\nall of Christ. All the longing after a better life is from Christ, and\n178 Selected Messages Book 3\nis an evidence that He is drawing you to Himself and that you are\nresponding to His drawing power.\u2014The Bible Echo, May 15, 1892.\nChrist\u2019s Nature Implanted in Us\u20141894 \u2014Truth, precious\ntruth, is sanctifying in its influence. The sanctification of the soul\nby the operation of the Holy Spirit is the implanting of Christ\u2019s\nnature in humanity. It is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ revealed\nin character, and the grace of Christ brought into active exercise\nin good works. Thus the character is transformed more and more\nperfectly after the image of Christ in righteousness and true holiness.\nThere are broad requirements in divine truth stretching out into one\nline after another of good works. The truths of the gospel are not\nunconnected; uniting they form one string of heavenly jewels, as\nin the personal work of Christ, and like threads of gold they run\nthrough the whole of Christian work and experience.\nChrist is the complete system of truth. He says, \u201cI am the way,[199]\nthe truth, and the life.\u201d All true believers center in Christ, their\ncharacter is irradiated by Christ; all meet in Christ, and circulate\nabout Christ. Truth comes from Heaven to purify and cleanse the\nhuman agent from every moral defilement. It leads to benevolent\naction, to kind, tender, thoughtful love toward the needy, the dis-\ntressed, the suffering. This is practical obedience to the words of\nChrist.\u2014Manuscript 34, 1894.\nSatan Claimed to Be Sanctified\u20141894\u2014Satan claimed to be\nsanctified, and exalted himself above God even in the courts of\nheaven. So great was his deceptive power that he corrupted a large\nnumber of angels, and enlisted their sympathy in his selfish interest.\nWhen he tempted Christ in the wilderness he claimed that he was\nsanctified, that he was a pure angel from the heavenly courts; but\nJesus was not deceived by his pretensions and neither will those be\ndeceived who live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth\nof God.\nGod will not accept a willful, imperfect obedience. Those who\nclaim to be sanctified, and yet turn away their ears from hearing\nthe law prove themselves to be the children of disobedience, whose\ncarnal hearts are not subject to the law of God, and neither indeed\ncan be.\u2014Manuscript 40, 1894.\nFaith and Good Works\u20141895\u2014Our acceptance with God is\nsure only through His beloved Son, and good works are but the result\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 179\nof the working of His sin-pardoning love. They are no credit to us,\nand we have nothing accorded to us for our good works by which\nwe may claim a part in the salvation of our souls. Salvation is God\u2019s\nfree gift to the believer, given to him for Christ\u2019s sake alone. The\ntroubled soul may find peace through faith in Christ, and his peace\nwill be in proportion to his faith and trust. He cannot present his\ngood works as a plea for the salvation of his soul.\nBut are good works of no real value? Is the sinner who commits\nsin every day with impunity, regarded of God with the same favor\nas the one who through faith in Christ tries to work in his integrity? [200]\nThe Scripture answers, \u201cWe are his workmanship, created in Christ\nJesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we\nshould walk in them.\u201d\nIn His divine arrangement, through His unmerited favor, the Lord\nhas ordained that good works shall be rewarded. We are accepted\nthrough Christ\u2019s merit alone; and the acts of mercy, the deeds of\ncharity, which we perform, are the fruits of faith; and they become a\nblessing to us; for men are to be rewarded according to their works.\nIt is the fragrance of the merit of Christ that makes our good\nworks acceptable to God, and it is grace that enables us to do the\nworks for which He rewards us. Our works in and of themselves\nhave no merit. When we have done all that it is possible for us to\ndo, we are to count ourselves as unprofitable servants. We deserve\nno thanks from God. We have only done what it was our duty to do,\nand our works could not have been performed in the strength of our\nown sinful natures.\nThe Lord has bidden us to draw nigh to Him and He will draw\nnigh to us; and drawing nigh to Him, we receive the grace by which\nto do those works which will be rewarded at His hands.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, January 29, 1895.\nSurrounded With Heaven\u2019s Atmosphere\u20141898 \u2014\u201cWe love\nhim, because he first loved us\u201d (1 John 4:19). True conversion,\ntrue sanctification, will be the cause of the change in our views and\nour feelings toward one another and toward God. \u201cWe have known\nand believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that\ndwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him\u201d (Verse 16). We\nmust increase in faith. We must know the sanctification of the Spirit.\nIn earnest prayer we must seek God, that the divine Spirit may work\n180 Selected Messages Book 3\nin us. God then will be glorified by the example of the human agent.\nWe shall be workers together with God.\nSanctification of soul, body, and spirit will surround us with the\natmosphere of heaven. If God has chosen us from eternity, it is that[201]\nwe might be holy, our conscience purged from dead works to serve\nthe living God. We must not in any way make self our god. God has\ngiven Himself to die for us, that He might purify us from all iniquity.\nThe Lord will carry on this work of perfection for us if we will allow\nourselves to be controlled by Him. He carries on this work for our\ngood and His own name\u2019s glory.\nThe Importance of Simple, Implicit Faith \u2014We must bear a\nliving testimony to the people, presenting before them the simplicity\nof faith. We must take God at His word, and believe that He will do\njust as He has said. If He chastises us, it is that we may be partakers\nof His divine nature. It runs through all His designs and plans to\ncarry on a daily sanctification in us. Shall we not see our work?\nShall we not present to others their duty, the privilege they have of\ngrowing in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ?\n\u201cThis is the will of God, even your sanctification\u201d (1 Thessalo-\nnians 4:3). We have not pressed forward to the mark of the prize of\nour high calling. Self has found too much room. Oh, let the work\nbe done under the special direction of the Holy Spirit. The Lord\ndemands all the powers of the mind and being. It is His will that\nwe should be conformed to Him in will, in temper, in spirit, in our\nmeditations. The work of righteousness cannot be carried forward\nunless we exercise implicit faith.\nMove every day under God\u2019s mighty working power. The fruit of\nrighteousness is quietness and assurance forever. If we had exercised\nmore faith in God and had trusted less to our own ideas and wisdom,\nGod would have manifested His power in a marked manner on\nhuman hearts. By a union with Him, by living faith, we are privileged\nto enjoy the virtue and efficacy of His mediation. Hence we are\ncrucified with Christ, dead with Christ, risen with Christ, to walk in\nnewness of life with Him.\u2014Letter 105, 1898.\nTrue Sanctification Needed\u20141902\u2014Two nights ago, I awoke[202]\nat ten o\u2019clock, heavily burdened in regard to the lack of the Holy\nSpirit\u2019s working among our people. I rose and walked the room,\npleading with the Lord to come closer, very much closer, to His\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 181\npeople, endowing them with such power that they may work His\nwork so mightily that through them may be revealed the abundant\ngrace of Christ....\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Christ has given a definition of true\nsanctification. He lived a life of holiness. He was an object lesson\nof what His followers are to be. We are to be crucified with Christ,\nburied with Him, and then quickened by His Spirit. Then we are\nfilled with His life.\nThe Work of a Lifetime\u2014Our sanctification is God\u2019s object in\nall His dealing with us. He has chosen us from eternity that we may\nbe holy. Christ gave Himself for our redemption, that through our\nfaith in His power to save from sin, we might be made complete in\nHim. In giving us His Word, He has given us bread from heaven.\nHe declares that if we eat His flesh and drink His blood, we shall\nreceive eternal life.\nWhy do we not dwell more upon this? Why do we not strive\nto make it easily understood, when it means so much? Why do\nnot Christians open their eyes to see the work God requires them\nto do. Sanctification is the progressive work of a lifetime. The\nLord declares, \u201cThis is the will of God, even your sanctification\u201d (1\nThessalonians 4:3). Is it your will that your desires and inclinations\nshall be brought into conformity to the divine will?\nAs Christians, we have pledged ourselves to realize and fulfill\nour responsibilities and to show to the world that we have a close\nconnection with God. Thus, through the godly words and works of\nHis disciples, Christ is to be represented.\nGod demands of us perfect obedience to His law\u2014the expression\nof His character. \u201cDo we then make void the law through faith? God\nforbid: yea, we establish the law\u201d (Romans 3:31). This law is the\necho of God\u2019s voice, saying to us, Holier, yes, holier still. Desire the\nfullness of the grace of Christ; yea, long\u2014hunger and thirst\u2014after [203]\nrighteousness. The promise is, \u201cYe shall be filled.\u201d Let your heart\nbe filled with an intense longing for this righteousness, the work of\nwhich God\u2019s Word declares is peace, and its effect quietness and\nassurance forever.\nPartakers of the Divine Nature\u2014It is our privilege to be par-\ntakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in\nthe world through lust. God has plainly stated that He requires us to\n182 Selected Messages Book 3\nbe perfect; and because He requires this, He has made provision that\nwe may be partakers of the divine nature. Only thus can we gain\nsuccess in our striving for eternal life. The power is given by Christ.\n\u201cAs many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\nsons of God\u201d (John 1:12).\nGod requires of us conformity to His image. Holiness is the\nreflection from His people of the bright rays of His glory. But in\norder to reflect this glory, man must work with God. The heart\nand mind must be emptied of all that leads to wrong. The Word of\nGod must be read and studied with an earnest desire to gain from\nit spiritual power. The bread of heaven must be eaten and digested,\nthat it may become a part of the life. Thus we gain eternal life. Then\nis answered the prayer of the Saviour, \u201cSanctify them through thy\ntruth: thy word is truth.\u201d\u2014Letter 153, 1902.\nOpinions and Practices to Be Conformed to God\u2019s Word \u2014\nThere are many who claim that they have been sanctified to God, and\nyet when the great standard of righteousness is presented to them\nthey become greatly excited and manifest a spirit which proves that\nthey know nothing of what it means to be sanctified. They have not\nthe mind of Christ; for those who are truly sanctified will reverence\nand obey the Word of God as fast as it is opened to them, and they\nwill express a strong desire to know what is truth on every point of\ndoctrine. An exultant feeling is no evidence of sanctification. The\nassertion, \u201cI am saved, I am saved,\u201d does not prove that the soul is\nsaved or sanctified.\nMany who are greatly excited are told that they are sanctified,[204]\nwhen they have no intelligent idea of what the term means, for\nthey know not the Scriptures or the power of God. They flatter\nthemselves that they are in conformity to the will of God because\nthey feel happy; but when they are tested, when the Word of God\nis brought to bear upon their experience, they stop their ears from\nhearing the truth, saying, \u201cI am sanctified,\u201d and that puts an end to\nthe controversy. They will have nothing to do with searching the\nScriptures to know what is truth, and prove that they are fearfully\nself-deceived. Sanctification means very much more than a flight of\nfeeling.\nExcitement is not sanctification. Entire conformity to the will of\nour Father which is in heaven is alone sanctification, and the will of\nEmphasis on Salvation Theme\u20141890-1908 183\nGod is expressed in His holy law. The keeping of all the command-\nments of God is sanctification. Proving yourselves obedient children\nto God\u2019s Word is sanctification. The Word of God is to be our guide,\nnot the opinions or ideas of men.\u2014The Review and Herald, March\n25, 1902.\nSanctification, An Experience in Continued Growth\u2014\n1908\u2014If we keep our minds stayed upon Christ, He will come\nunto us as the rain, as the former and latter rain upon the earth. As\nthe Sun of Righteousness, He will arise with healing in His wings.\nWe may grow as the lily, revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.\nBy constantly looking to and patterning after Christ as our per-\nsonal Saviour, we shall grow up into Him in all things. Our faith\nwill grow, our conscience will be sanctified. We will more and more\nbecome like Christ in all our works and words. Thank God, we\nshall believe His Word. \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,\nlongsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance:\nagainst such there is no law.\u201d\u2014Letter 106, 1908.\n184 Selected Messages Book 3\nSection 6\u2014Education\u2014The Church [205]\n[206]School, and Universities of the World\nIntroduction\nIn 1902 the community surrounding the St. Helena Sanitarium, a\ncommunity in which Ellen White resided from 1901 until her death,\nwas served by the one-room Crystal Springs public school. It was\ntaught by a dedicated Seventh-day Adventist teacher, Mr. Anthony.\nAt the turn of the century, Seventh-day Adventists in some parts\nof the United States, largely as the result of Ellen White\u2019s counsel,\nwere just moving into the establishment of church schools for the\nchildren of grade-school age. At 6:00 a.m. on Monday, July 14,\n1902, Ellen White addressed the members of the Sanitarium church,\nurging the establishment of a church school, and as an incentive of-\nfered to provide the use of a nearby portion of her land at Elmshaven\nfor the project. Excerpts from the timely address she gave open this\nsection.\nThe Sanitarium church accepted Ellen White\u2019s proposal, but\nwhen the school opened in the fall no provision was made for small\nchildren, because it was reasoned that those under eight or ten years\nof age should be taught at home in harmony with Ellen White\u2019s\ninstruction given earlier.\nNot all parents were prepared to meet the ideal she set forth in\nher earlier writings, and this left not a few children to drift without\ndiscipline or proper training during their childhood years. The one\ndeterrent to the church\u2019s making provision for the younger children\nwas the oft-quoted E. G. White statement written in 1872 that\n\u201cParents should be the only teachers of their children until they have\nreached eight or ten years of age.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n3:137.\nThere seemed to be a marked division of thinking on the part of[207]\nchurch officers and members on this important question.\nAs time went on the church school board arranged for an inter-\nview with Ellen White at her home early Thursday morning, January\n14, 1904, to discuss this question of school-age attendance and the\nresponsibility of the church for the education of young children. W.\n186\nIntroduction 187\nC. White saw it as rather a landmark meeting that would set a pattern\nfor other church schools across the land.\nEllen White was informed in advance of the issue to be dis-\ncussed and so was prepared to speak to the question in its several\naspects. Minutes of the meeting were made and a copy of them was\nintroduced into the general Document File in the Elmshaven vault.\nHowever, through some oversight no copy was placed in the regular\nE. G. White letter and manuscript file. Being minutes of a school\nboard meeting, they were lost sight of for many years. During a\nthorough search in 1975 for all materials relating to the early training\nof children, the minutes of this enlightening interview came to light\non April 24, 1975, and were published in full in the Review and\nHerald (now the Adventist Review) of April 24, 1975.\nBrief excerpts from the 1902 appeal for a church school and\nthat portion of the board minutes of January 14, 1904, which relate\ndirectly to the appropriate school age for the children of Adventist\nparents, are presented in chapters 23 and 24.\nChapter 25 brings together a few miscellaneous choice state-\nments under the title of \u201cGeneral Guiding Principles.\u201d\nIn 1887 Ellen White suggested in Testimonies for the Church\n5:583, 584, that \u201cstrong young men, rooted and grounded in the\nfaith\u201d could \u201cif so counseled by our leading brethren, enter the\nhigher colleges in our land, where they would have a wider field for\nstudy and observation,\u201d and who like the Waldenses \u201cmight do a\ngood work, even while gaining their education.\u201d These sentiments [208]\nwere repeated several times during the next decade, emphasizing the\nopportunities this would give for effective witness in non-Seventh-\nday Adventist Schools, at the same time sounding timely cautions.\nChapter 26 closes with a selection of these counsels.\nWhite Trustees.\nChapter 23\u2014Appeal for a Church School[209]\n[Portion of an appeal for a church school to serve the Sanitarium\n[Deer Park], California, church, Monday morning, July 14, 1902.]\nI promised that I would speak this morning in regard to the ne-\ncessity of withdrawing our children from the public schools, and of\nproviding suitable places where they can be educated aright. I have\nfelt surprised at the apparently indifferent attitude of some, notwith-\nstanding the oft-repeated warnings given that parents must provide\nfor their families not merely with reference to their present interests,\nbut especially with reference to their future, eternal interests. The\ncharacters that we form in this life are to decide our destiny. If we\nchoose, we may live a life that measures with the life of God.\nEvery Christian family is a church in itself. The members of\nthe family are to be Christlike in every action. The father is to\nsustain so close a relation to God that he realizes his duty to make\nprovision for the members of his family to receive an education and\ntraining that will fit them for the future, immortal life. His children\nare to be taught the principles of heaven. He is the priest of the\nhousehold, accountable to God for the influence that he exerts over\nevery member of his family. He is to place his family under the most[210]\nfavorable circumstances possible, so that they shall not be tempted\nto conform to the habits and customs, the evil practices and lax\nprinciples, that they would find in the world....\nUpon fathers and mothers devolves the responsibility of giving\na Christian education to the children entrusted to them. They are\nnever to neglect their children. In no case are they to let any line of\nbusiness to so absorb mind and time and talents that their children,\nwho should be led in harmony with God, are allowed to drift until\nthey are separated far from Him. They are not to allow their children\nto slip out of their grasp into the hands of unbelievers. They are to\ndo all in their power to keep them from imbibing the spirit of the\nworld. They are to train them to become helpers together with God.\n188\nAppeal for a Church School 189\nThey are God\u2019s human hand, fitting themselves and their children\nfor an endless life in the heavenly home.\nThe education of our children begins in the home. The mother is\ntheir first teacher. When they become old enough to attend school,\nshall we permit them to enter the public schools?\nThe Public School or Church School? \u2014Many years ago, in\nOakland, my husband and I conversed with a public school teacher\nin regard to the public schools in the city. He said to us: \u201cIf parents\nknew of the iniquity that is to our certain knowledge practiced in\nthese schools, there would be a furor raised in regard to these schools\nsuch as neither you nor I can imagine. The young people are rotten;\nand what kind of homes they have is more than our teachers can\ntell.\u201d This statement was made over twenty years ago. Have the\nconditions in our public schools improved since that time?\nSome fathers and mothers are so indifferent, so careless, that\nthey think it makes no difference whether their children attend a\nchurch school or a public school. \u201cWe are in the world,\u201d they say,\n\u201cand we cannot get out of it.\u201d But, parents, we can get a good way\nout of the world, if we choose to do so. We can avoid seeing many\nof the evils that are multiplying so fast in these last days. We can [211]\navoid hearing about much of the wickedness and crime that exist.\nEverything that can be done should be done to place ourselves\nand our children where we shall not see the iniquity that is practised\nin the world. We should carefully guard the sight of our eyes and\nthe hearing of our ears, so that these awful things shall not enter\nour minds. When the daily newspaper comes into the house, I feel\nas if I wanted to hide it, that the ridiculous, sensational things in it\nmay not be seen. It seems as if the enemy is at the foundation of the\npublishing of many things that appear in newspapers. Every sinful\nthing that can be found is uncovered and laid bare before the world.\nThe line of demarcation between those who serve God and those\nwho serve Him not, is ever to remain distinct. The difference be-\ntween believers and unbelievers should be as great as the difference\nbetween light and darkness. When God\u2019s people take the position\nthat they are the temple of the Holy Ghost, Christ Himself abiding\nwithin, they will so clearly reveal Him in spirit, words, and actions,\nthat there will be an unmistakable distinction between them and\nSatan\u2019s followers....\n190 Selected Messages Book 3\nEducating Children in Bible Principles\u2014Some of God\u2019s peo-\nple permit their children to attend the public schools, where they\nmingle with those who are corrupt in morals. In these schools their\nchildren can neither study the Bible nor learn its principles. Christian\nparents, you must make provision for your children to be educated in\nBible principles. And do not rest satisfied merely with having them\nstudy the Word in the church school. Teach the Scriptures to your\nchildren yourselves when you sit down, when you go out, when you\ncome in, and when you walk by the way. Walk with your children\nmuch oftener than you do. Talk with them. Set their minds running\nin a right channel. As you do this, you will find that the light and the\nglory of God will come into your homes. But how can you expect\nHis blessing when you do not teach your children aright?\nI am merely touching upon a few points on a number of subjects[212]\nrelating to the training and education of children. Sometime I hope\nto treat upon these points more fully, for I have been thoroughly\naroused to realize that these matters must be presented before our\npeople. Seventh-day Adventists must move in a way altogether\ndifferent from the way in which they have been moving, if they\nexpect the approval of God to rest upon them in their homes.\nEvery faithful parent will hear from the lips of the Master the\nwords, \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant ... enter thou into\nthe joy of thy Lord.\u201d May the Lord help us to be good and faithful\nservants in our dealings with one another.

I have tried\nto write out this instruction, and to give it to others. In one of the\nforthcoming volumes of my writings [Education] will be published\nconsiderable additional matter on the training of children.\nThose who assume the responsibilities of parenthood should first\nconsider whether they will be able to surround their children with\nproper influences. The home is both a family church and a family\nschool. The atmosphere of the home should be so spiritual that all\nthe members of the family, parents and children, will be blessed\nand strengthened by their association with one another. Heavenly\ninfluences are educational. Those who are surrounded by such\ninfluences are being prepared for entrance into the school above.\nMothers should be able to instruct their little ones wisely during[215]\nthe earlier years of childhood. If every mother were capable of\ndoing this, and would take time to teach her children the lessons\nthey should learn in early life, then all children could be kept in the\nhome school until they are eight, or nine, or ten years old.\nBut many who enter the marriage relation fail of realizing all\nthe sacred responsibilities that motherhood brings. Many are sadly\nlacking in disciplinary power. In many homes there is but little\ndiscipline, and the children are allowed to do as they please. Such\nchildren drift hither and thither; there is nobody in the home capable\nof guiding them aright, nobody who with wise tact can teach them\nhow to help father and mother, nobody who can properly lay the\n192\nCounsel Regarding Age of School Entrance 193\nfoundation that should underlie their future education. Children\nwho are surrounded by these unfortunate conditions are indeed to be\npitied. If not afforded an opportunity for proper training outside the\nhome, they are debarred from many privileges that, by right, every\nchild should enjoy. This is the light that has been presented to me.\nThose who are unable to train their children aright, should never\nhave assumed the responsibilities of parents. But because of their\nmistaken judgment, shall we make no effort to help their little ones\nto form right characters? God desires us to deal with these problems\nsensibly.\nChurch Schools to Be Connected With Sanitariums \u2014In all\nour sanitariums the standard is to be kept high. With these institu-\ntions should be connected, as physicians, managers, and helpers,\nonly those who keep their households in order. The conduct of the\nchildren has an influence that tells upon all who come to these sani-\ntariums. God desires that this influence shall be reformatory. And\nthis can be; but care is required. The father and the mother must give\nspecial attention to the training of each child. But you know how\nthe families are up on this hillside. The patients understand how it\nis. The way it is presented to me is that it is a shame that there is not\nthe influence over the young children that there should be. Every [216]\none of them should be employed in doing something that is useful.\nThey have been told what to do. If the father cannot be with them,\nthe mother should be instructed how to teach them.\nBut since I have been here, the light has been given me that the\nvery best thing that can be done is to have a school. I had no thought\nthat the very little ones would be embraced in the school\u2014not the\nvery little ones. But it would be best to have this school for those\nwho can be instructed and have the restraining influence upon them\nwhich a schoolteacher should exert. We have a school here because\nthe Word of God could not be taught in the other [public] school.\nOur brother [Anthony] that teaches that school is fully capable of\ncarrying a school with teaching the Word. He is fully capable of\ndoing that. He has his position, they have hired him, and as long as\nthey let him stay undisturbed, he had better stay there.\nSchool Privileges for Younger Children\u2014But here is a work\nthat must be done for the families, and for the children that are\nas old as seven years and eight years and nine years. We should\n194 Selected Messages Book 3\nhave a lower department, that is a second department, where these\nchildren could be instructed. They will learn in school that which\nthey frequently do not learn out of school, except by association....\nNow, it seems that the question is about these children going to\nschool. I want to know from the parents, every one of them, who it is\nthat feels perfectly satisfied with their children, as they are, without\nsending them to the school\u2014to a school that has Bible lessons, has\norder, has discipline, and is trying to find something for them to do\nto occupy their time. I do not think there is anyone, if they come to\nunderstand it, who will have objections.\nThe Setting of the Early Counsel \u2014But when I heard what\nthe objections were, that the children could not go to school till\nthey were ten years old, I wanted to tell you that there was not\na Sabbathkeeping school when the light was given to me that the[217]\nchildren should not attend school until they were old enough to be\ninstructed. They should be taught at home to know what proper\nmanners were when they went to school, and not be led astray. The\nwickedness carried on in the common schools is almost beyond\nconception.\nThat is how it is, and my mind has been greatly stirred in regard\nto the idea, \u201cWhy, Sister White has said so and so, and Sister White\nhas said so and so; and therefore we are going right up to it.\u201d\nGod wants us all to have common sense, and he wants us to\nreason from common sense. Circumstances alter conditions. Cir-\ncumstances change the relation of things.\nA Church School Versus Poor Home Management\u2014Here is\na Sanitarium, and that sanitarium must carry the highest possible\ninfluence inside and out. Then, if they see children who come there\u2014\nsharp-eyed, lynx-eyed, wandering about, with nothing to do, getting\ninto mischief, and all these things\u2014it is painful to the senses of\nthose that want to keep the reputation of the school. Therefore, I,\nfrom the light that God has given me, [declare that] if there is a\nfamily that has not the capabilities of educating, nor discipline and\ngovernment over their children, requiring obedience, the very best\nthing is to put them in some place where they will obey. Put them in\nsome place where they will be required to obey, because obedience\nis better than sacrifice. Good behavior is to be carried out in every\nfamily.\nCounsel Regarding Age of School Entrance 195\nWe are educating God\u2019s little ones in our homes. Now what\nkind of an education are we giving them? Our words, are they loose\nand careless and slack? Is there an overbearing disposition? Is\nthere a scolding and fretting because parents have not the powers\nto manage? The Lord wants us to take all things into consideration.\nEvery parent has on his hands a sum to prove: How are my children?\nWhere are they? Are they coming up for God or for the devil? All\nthese things are to be considered.\nThe book that is coming out will have much to say in regard to [218]\nthe great principles that are to be carried out in training the children,\nfrom the very baby in arms. The enemy will work right through\nthose children, unless they are disciplined. Someone disciplines\nthem. If the mother or the father does not do it, the devil does. That\nis how it is. He has the control....\nI shall not say so much now, because I want to understand just\nwhat I should speak on. I want the objections brought forth, why\nchildren should not have an education.\nThe Kindergarten at Battle Creek\nWe could do the same as they have in Battle Creek. They took\nme from place to place in the orphan asylum [Haskell Home] in\nBattle Creek. There were their little tables, there were their little\nchildren from five years old and upward. They were being educated\non the kindergarten plan: how to work and how to manage. They\nhad a great pile of sand of a proper quality, and they were teaching\nthe children how to work together, how to make Noah\u2019s ark, and\nhow to make the animals that enter into the Noah\u2019s ark. They were\nall doing this kind of work. It takes something....\nNow, I have perfect confidence in Sister Peck\u2019s teaching, but if\nshe carries on what she has carried on\u2014and I am satisfied it is just\nthe thing that ought to be done\u2014there would have to be an extra\nteacher; don\u2019t you think so?\nSister Peck: [One of Ellen G. White\u2019s literary assistants serving\nas the church school teacher.] I think if we did the work in a satis-\nfactory manner, and if we have any more children, we ought to have\nsome extra help.\n196 Selected Messages Book 3\nLight Given on \u201cThese Things\u201d\nSister White: My ideas have come out in a crude way, just a jot\nhere and a jot there. I have it written out, but not all. I have more to\nwrite. I want you to take care of what I have said. First, understand[219]\nthis. This is the light that has been given me in regard to these things.\nHere are children that are quick. There are children five years\nold that can be educated as well as many children ten years old, as\nfar as capabilities are concerned, to take in the mother\u2019s matters and\nsubjects.\nNow I want that just as long as Willie\u2019s children [Ages: Henry\nand Herbert, twins, 7 years; Grace, 3 years. In time, all attended\nthis school.] are here, and they live here, I want they should have\nthe discipline of a school. If it can be connected with this school\nby putting on an addition to the building, one room say, for such\nstudents, every one of us ought to feel a responsibility to provide that\nroom. Those mothers that want to keep their children at home, and\nare fully competent and would prefer to discipline them herself, why,\nno one has any objection to that. They can do that. But provision\nis to be made so that the children of all who have any connection\nwith this food factory and sanitarium and these things that are being\ncarried on here, should be educated. We must have it stand to reach\nthe highest standards.\nElder C. L. Taylor : Sister White, there is one question that I\nshould like to raise, regarding the responsibility of parents and the\nrelation of that responsibility to the church school. Now, suppose\nI have a little boy\u2014I have one\u2014seven years old. We are perfectly\ncapable of training him, we have fitted ourselves to do that work.\nNow suppose we choose not to take that responsibility, to neglect the\nboy, let him drift around. Then does it become the responsibility of\nthe church to do what I could do if I would do? That is the question.\nIf I don\u2019t take care of my boy when I can, when I am able to do it,\nwould I ask the church to do it in my place?\nSister White: You can take care of them, but do you?\nElder W. C. White: She refuses to take your isolated experience.\nSister White: The church here on this hill is a responsible church.[220]\nIt is connected with outside influences. These influences are con-\nstantly brought in to testify of us. The question is, Shall it be united,\nCounsel Regarding Age of School Entrance 197\nand shall it, if it is necessary, prepare a room\u2014which won\u2019t cost\neverlastingly too much\u2014a room that these children should come to\nand have discipline, and have a teacher, and get brought up where\nthey are prepared for the higher school? Now that is the question.\nThe Kind of Education the Children Need\nI say, these little children that are small ought to have education,\njust what they would get in school. They ought to have the school\ndiscipline under a person who understands how to deal with children\nin accordance with their different temperaments. They should try to\nhave these children understand their responsibilities to one another,\nand their responsibility to God. They should have fastened in their\nminds the very principles that are going to fit them for the higher\ngrade and the higher school.\nThere is a higher school that we are all going to, and unless these\nchildren are brought up with the right habits and the right thoughts,\nand the right discipline, I wonder how they will ever enter that school\nabove? Where is their reverence? Where are their choice ideas that\nthey should cultivate? And all these things. It must be an everyday\nexperience.\nThe mother, as she goes around, is not to fret and to scold, and to\nsay, \u201cYou are in my way, and I wish you would get away, I wish you\nwould go outdoors,\u201d or any such thing. She is to treat her children\njust as God should treat His older children. He calls us children\nin His family. He wants us educated and trained according to the\nprinciples of the Word of God. He wants this education to commence\nwith the little ones. If the mother has not the tact, the ingenuity, if\nshe does not know how to treat human minds, she must put them\nunder somebody that will discipline them and mold and fashion their\nminds.\nNow, have I presented it so that it can be understood? Is there [221]\nany point, Willie, that I have in the book that I have not touched\nhere?\nW. C. White : I don\u2019t know. I find, Mother, that our people\nthroughout the States and throughout the world, I must say, some-\ntimes make very far-reaching rulings based on an isolated statement.\n198 Selected Messages Book 3\nNow, in my study of the Bible and in my study of your writings,\nI have come to believe that there is a principle underlying every\nprecept, and that we cannot understand properly the precept without\ngrasping the principle.\nI have believed that in some of the statements which have created\na good deal of controversy\u2014like your counsels concerning the use\nof butter, and your statement that the only teacher that a child should\nhave until it was eight or ten years old\u2014it was our privilege to grasp\nthe principle. I have believed that in the study of those statements\nthat we should recognize that every precept of God is given in mercy,\nand in consideration of the circumstances.\nGod said, \u201cWhat God hath joined together let no man put asun-\nder\u201d; and yet Christ explains the law of divorce as given because of\nthe hardness of their hearts. Because of the degeneracy of the people\na divorce law which was not in God\u2019s original plan was permitted.\nI believe that the principle should be understood in regard to such\nisolated statements as your protest against the use of butter, and the\nstatement that the child should have no other teacher than the mother\nuntil it was eight or ten years old.\nNow, when that view was given you about butter, there was\npresented to you the condition of things\u2014people using butter full\nof germs. They were frying and cooking in it, and its use was\ndeleterious. But later on, when our people studied into the principle\nof things, they found that while butter is not best, it may not be so\nbad as some other evils; and so in some cases they are using it.\nI have supposed that this school question was the same. The ideal[222]\nplan is that the mother should be the teacher\u2014an intelligent teacher\nsuch an one as you have described this morning. But I have felt that\nit was a great misfortune to our cause from Maine to California, and\nfrom Manitoba to Florida, that our people should take that statement\nthat the child should have no teacher but the parent until it is eight\nor ten years old, as a definite forbidding of those children to have\nschool privileges. If I understand it, that is really the question before\nus this morning.\nWhen the brethren study this matter from the standpoint of the\ngood of the child, from the standpoint of fairness to the parents, as\nfar as I can see, they all acknowledge that there are conditions in\nwhich it would be better for the child to have some school privilege\nCounsel Regarding Age of School Entrance 199\nthan to be ruled out. But there is the precept, a child shall have no\nteacher but the parents until it is eight or ten years old; that settles\nit....\nSister White: Well, if parents have not got it in them you might\njust as well stop where you are. Therefore, we have got to make\nprovision, because there are a good many parents that have not taken\nit upon themselves to discipline themselves....\nI believe that the people about here that have advantages can\neach do a little something to support a school for the others. I am\nwilling to do it. I do not think that should be a consideration that\nshould come in at all. [We talk of] \u201cthe expense,\u201d \u201cthe expense,\u201d\n\u201cthe expense\u201d\u2014it is nothing at all to have the weight of a thimbleful\nof expense.\nSetting a Pattern\nW. C. White: As my children have been mentioned, I should like\nto say a word about this. My interest in the outcome of this interview\nis not now at all with reference to my own children. My interest in\nthe outcome of this interview is with reference to its influence upon\nour work throughout the world. My interest for this school from the [223]\nbeginning until now has not been principally with reference to my\nchildren....\nIt is known by everybody that Sister Peck has had a broad ex-\nperience in teaching, and that she has had four years\u2019 experience\nwith mother, dealing with her writings, helping to prepare the book\nEducation. My greatest interest for the school has not been my own\nfamily, neither has it been simply the St. Helena church.\nMy interest in this school lies in the fact that it is our privilege\nto set a pattern. The successes and failures and the rulings of this\nschool will affect our church school work throughout California and\nmuch farther, because of Sister Peck\u2019s long experience as a teacher,\nand her work with you, Mother, in helping to prepare the book on\neducation. All these things have put this school where it is a city set\non a hill.\nNow, my distress at the ruling with reference to the younger\nchildren has been not principally because my children were ruled\n200 Selected Messages Book 3\nout, but to build up a ruling which I consider is very cruel. It is being\nused in a way to do our younger children a great deal of harm.\nThe Question of Kindergarten\nThe world is doing a great work for the children through kinder-\ngartens. In places where we have institutions, and both parents are\nemployed, they would gladly send children to a kindergarten. I have\nbeen convinced that in many of our churches a kindergarten properly\nconducted for a few hours a day, would be a great blessing. I have\nnot found anything in your teachings or rulings, Mother, or advice\nto our people that would be contrary to it. But the rulings of our\nschool superintendents have killed, completely killed, in most parts\nof the country any effort toward providing kindergarten work for our\nchildren.\nThere are a few instances where they stand to carry it forward.\nDr. Kellogg does it in his orphans\u2019 school that you have seen and\npraised, and in a few other places they are doing it. At Berrien\nSprings they ventured last summer to bring in a kindergarten teacher[224]\nand to permit that part of the work to have a little consideration; but\ngenerally, in about nine tenths of the field, this ruling of our school\nsuperintendents kills that part of the work completely.\nSister White: Well, there has got to be a reformation in that line.\nW. C. White: And the ruling in this school here, and the reasons\nthat have always been given me for this ruling have been based on\nyour statement that a child\u2019s mother is to be its only teacher until it\nis eight or ten years old. I have believed that for the best interests of\nour school work throughout the world, that it is our privilege to have\nsuch an interview as we have had this morning, and also to study\ninto the principle which underlies such things.\nSister White: Yes, it is right that it should stand before the people\nright. Now you will never find a better opportunity to have Sister\nPeck have the supervision over even the younger children. There\nhas got to be a blending in some way.\nAs for a room, and there should be room, I question which is\nbest, whether it should be connected right with the building, or\nwhether it should be separate. It seemed to me that it might be a\nbuilding by itself. I do not know which would be best. That must be\nCounsel Regarding Age of School Entrance 201\nconsidered\u2014the advantages and disadvantages. I think Sister Peck,\nas well or better than any of the rest of us, could tell how that should\nbe....\nCould the School Constitute a Disservice?\nC. L. Taylor: We have talked this: that the church school will not\nbe a blessing to a community, when it comes to take a responsibility\nthat the parents themselves can carry. And when we go ahead and put\nour money into a building, it does not make any difference whether\nit is a building or a room. But when we take the responsibility that\ncould be carried by the parents, then the church school becomes a\ncurse or a hindrance, rather than a blessing. Now that is all I have [225]\never heard when we have come to the point....\nSister Peck: It has been a question in my mind on that point,\nSister White, what our duty as teachers is\u2014whether it was to try to\nhelp the parents to see and to take up their responsibility, or to take\nit away from them by taking their children into the school.\nSister White: If they have not felt their responsibility from all the\nbooks and writings and sermons, you might roll it onto them from\nnow till the Lord comes, and they would not have any burden. It is\nno use talking about responsibility, when they have never felt it.\nA School That Makes a Favorable Impression\nWe want to have a school in connection with the Sanitarium. It\nis presented to me that wherever there is a sanitarium, there must\nbe a school, and that school must be carried on in such a way that it\nmakes an impression on all who shall visit the Sanitarium. People\nwill come into that school. They will see how that school is managed.\nIt should not be far from the Sanitarium, so that they can understand.\nIn the management of the school there is to be the very best kind\nof discipline. In learning, the students cannot have their own way.\nThey have got to give up their own way to discipline. This is a lesson\nthat is yet to be learned by a good many families. But we hear, \u201cOh,\nlet them do this. They are nothing but children. They will learn\nwhen they get older.\u201d\n202 Selected Messages Book 3\nWell, just as soon as a child in my care would begin to show\npassion, and throw himself on the floor, he never did it but once, I\nwant to tell you. I would not let the devil work right through that\nchild and take possession of it.\nThe Lord wants us to understand things. He says, Abraham\ncommanded his children and his household after him, and we want\nto understand what it means to command, and we want to understand\nthat we have got to take hold of the work if we resist the devil.\nWell, I do not know whether we are any farther along than when[226]\nwe began.\nC. L. Taylor: Yes, I think we are.\nSister White: But some things have been said.\nL. M. Bowen: I think we know what we will have to do.\nSister Gotzian: Enough has been said to set us thinking, and to\ndo something.\nSister White: The Lord is in earnest with us. Yes; we have got\nto be an example. And now you see there are so many sanitariums,\nand so many schools, that must be connected with them. We have\ngot to come to our senses and recognize that we have to carry an\ninfluence\u2014that is an influence in regard to the children....\nYour school is to be a sample school. It is not to be a sample\nafter the schools of the day. It is not to be any such thing. Your\nschool is to be according to a plan that is far ahead of these other\nschools. It is to be a practical thing. The lessons are to be put into\npractice, and not merely a recitation of [theory].\nC. L.

In all our schools this word is to be made\nthe essence of education; it is this that will give sanctified strength,\nwisdom, integrity, and moral power, if it is brought into the experi-\nence.

The Lord has not designed any one, special, exact\nplan in education. It is the fear of the Lord that is the beginning of\nwisdom. When men with their varied traits of character shall take [228]\nup their appointed work as teachers and follow a plan of teaching\naccording to their own capabilities, they are not to suppose they\nmust be a facsimile of those teachers who served before them, lest\nthey spoil their own record.\u2014Manuscript 170, 1901.\nA Definition of True Education\nTrue education is the preparation of the mental, moral, and phys-\nical powers for the performance of every duty, pleasant or otherwise,\n203\n204 Selected Messages Book 3\nthe training of every habit and practice, of heart, mind, and soul for\ndivine service. Then of you it can be said in the heavenly courts,\n\u201cYe are laborers together with God\u201d (see 1 Corinthians 3:9).\u2014Letter\n189, 1899.\nCommendable Qualities of the Swiss Schools\nI see some things here in Switzerland that I think are worthy of\nimitation. The teachers of the schools always go out with their pupils\nwhile they are at play, and teach them how to amuse themselves and\nrepress any disorder or any wrong. This is an invariable law, and\nincludes children from five to fifteen years of age.\nAs a reward for good behavior and studious habits the teachers\ntake their scholars out and have a long walk with them, dismissing\nthe school earlier than usual. I like this; I think there is less oppor-\ntunity for the children to yield to temptation. The teachers seem to\nenter into the sports of the children and to regulate them.\nLove Versus Strict, Unbending Rules \u2014I cannot in any way\nsanction the idea that children must feel that they are under a constant\ndistrust, and must be watched, and cannot act as children. But let\nthe teachers join in the amusements of the children, be one with\nthem, and show they want them to be happy, and it will give the\nchildren confidence. They can be controlled by love, but not by a\nstern, strict, unbending rule, to follow them in their meals and in\ntheir amusements.\u2014Letter 42, 1886.\nOur talents are lent us in trust, to use and increase by their use.[229]\nOh, if parents would only realize that the families on earth may\nbe symbols of the family in heaven. If they would realize their\naccountability to keep their homes free from every taint of moral\nevil. God designs that we shall have far more of heaven in our\nfamilies than we now enjoy.\nPleasant Scenes and Interesting Work \u2014From their earliest\nyears the children are learners, and if pleasant scenes are kept before\nthem in the home, they will become familiar with Christian courtesy,\nkindness, and love. Their minds are built up by what they see and\nhear, and parents are sowing the seed which will reap a harvest either\nfor weal or woe. If parents are Christians in name only, if they are\nnot doers of the Word, they are placing their own superscription on\nGeneral Guiding Principles 205\ntheir children, and not the superscription of God. Children long for\nsomething to impress the mind. For Christ\u2019s sake, parents, give their\nhungering, thirsting souls something upon which to feed.\nChildren are naturally active, and if parents do not furnish them\nwith employment, Satan will invent something to keep them busy\nin an evil work. Therefore train your children to useful work. You\ncan clothe all work with a dignity which will make it profitable and\nelevating.\nBring Pleasure in Relationship With Children\u2014Do not feel\nit your duty to make the lives of your children unpleasant. The un-\npleasantness will come fast enough. Bring all the pleasure possible\ninto your exercises as teacher and educator of your children. En-\ncourage them to make a companion of you. Sinful impulses, sinful\ninclinations, and objectionable habits you will surely find in your\nchildren; but if you encourage them to seek your society, you can\ngive a right mold to their tastes and feelings, and banish discontent,\nrepining, and rebellion. Overcome their pride by living before them\nan example of meekness and lowliness of heart.\nWe need to weed out from our conversation everything that is [230]\nharsh and condemnatory. When we have put on Christ in meekness\nand lowliness of heart we shall represent Christ in all our dealings\nwith our children. To all who labor in Christ\u2019s lines for the salvation\nof souls, the Saviour says, \u201cYe are laborers together with God. Ye\nare God\u2019s husbandry; ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 143,\n1899.\nChapter 26\u2014Attending Colleges and Universities of[231]\nthe Land\nIt would be perfectly safe for our youth to enter the colleges of\nour land if they were converted every day; but if they feel at liberty\nto be off guard one day, that very day Satan is ready with his snares,\nand they are overcome and led to walk in false paths\u2014forbidden\npaths, paths that the Lord has not cast up.\nNow, shall professed Christians refuse to associate with the\nunconverted, and seek to have no communication with them? No,\nthey are to be with them, in the world and not of the world, but not\nto partake of their ways, not to be impressed by them, not to have a\nheart open to their customs and practices. Their associations are to\nbe for the purpose of drawing others to Christ.\nThe Influence of Error Repeatedly Presented \u2014Here is the\ndanger of our youth. The attractions in these institutions are such,\nand the teaching so intermixed with error and sophistry, that they\ncannot discern the poison of sentiment mingled with the useful and\nprecious. There is such an undercurrent, and it works in such a\nmanner that many do not perceive it, but it is constantly at work.\nCertain ideas are constantly advanced by the professors, and repeated\nover and over, and at last the mind begins to assimilate and conform\nto these ideas.\nJust so when infidel authors are studied. These men have sharp[232]\nintellects, and their sharp ideas are presented, and the mind of the\nstudent is influenced by them; they are pleased with their brilliance.\nBut where did those men obtain their powers of intellect? Where\ndid they get their sharpness? From the fountain of all knowledge.\nBut they have prostituted their powers; they have given them as a\ncontribution to the devil, and don\u2019t you think the devil is smart?\nMany are traveling in the devil\u2019s tracks by reading infidel authors.\nSatan is a sharp being, and they fall in love with his learning and\nsmartness.\u2014Manuscript 8b, 1891.\n206\nAttending Colleges and Universities of the Land 207\nThe Perils of Listening to the World\u2019s Great Men\nTo many of our youth there is great danger in listening to the\ndiscourses that are given by those who in the world are called great\nmen. These discourses are often of a highly intellectual nature, and\nprevailing errors of science falsely so-called and of popular religious\ndoctrine are mingled with wise sayings and observations, but they\nundermine the statements of the Bible and give the impression that\nthere is reason for questioning the truth of the inspired Word. In this\nway the seeds of skepticism are sown by great and professedly wise\nmen, but their names are registered in the books of record in heaven\nas fools, and they are an offense to God. They repeat the falsehoods\nthat Satan put into the mouth of the serpent, and educate the youth\nin delusions.\nThis is the kind of education the enemy delights in. It is sorcery.\nThe great apostle inquired, \u201cWho hath bewitched you that ye should\nnot obey the truth?\u201d Those who receive and admire the sentiments\nof these so-called great men are in danger, for through the subtlety\nof the enemy the sophistical reasoning of these false teachers takes\nroot in the heart of our youth, and almost imperceptibly they are\nconverted from truth to error. But the conversion should be just the\nother way. Our young men who have seen the evidences of the verity\nof truth should be firmly established and able to win souls to Christ\nfrom the darkness of error. [233]\nThe youth who go to Ann Arbor [The University of Michigan\nwas located at Ann Arbor, some 65 miles east of Battle Creek;\nin 1891 Adventist youth seeking medical training studied there.\u2014\nCompilers.] must receive Jesus as their personal Saviour or they\nwill build upon the sand, and their foundation will be swept away.\nThe spirit of Christ must regenerate and sanctify the soul, and pure\naffection for Christ must be kept alive by humble, daily trust in\nGod. Christ must be formed within, the hope of glory. Let Jesus be\nrevealed to those with whom you associate.\u2014Letter 26, 1891.\nSeventh-day Adventist Students\nThe Waldensians entered the schools of the world as students.\nThey made no pretensions; apparently they paid no attention to any-\n208 Selected Messages Book 3\none; but they lived out what they believed. They never sacrificed\nprinciple, and their principles soon became known. This was dif-\nferent from anything the other students had seen, and they began to\nask themselves, What does this all mean? Why cannot these men be\ninduced to swerve from their principles? While they were consid-\nering this, they heard them praying in their rooms, not to the virgin\nMary, but to the Saviour, whom they addressed as the only mediator\nbetween God and man. The worldly students were encouraged to\nmake inquiries, and as the simple story of the truth as it is in Jesus\nwas told, their minds grasped it.\nThese things I tried to present at Harbor Heights [at an educa-\ntional convention in 1891]. Those who have the spirit of God, who\nhave the truth wrought into their very being, should be encouraged\nto enter colleges, and live the truth, as Daniel and Paul did. Each\none should study to see what is the best way to get the truth into\nthe school, that the light may shine forth. Let them show that they\nrespect all the rules and regulations of the school. The leaven will\nbegin to work; for we can depend much more upon the power of\nGod manifested in the lives of his children than upon any words[234]\nthat can be spoken. But they should also tell inquirers, in as simple\nlanguage as they can, of the simple Bible doctrines.\nDropping Seeds of Truth Into Minds and Hearts\nThere are those who, after becoming established, rooted and\ngrounded in the truth, should enter these institutions of learning\nas students. They can keep the living principles of the truth, and\nobserve the Sabbath, and yet they will have opportunity to work for\nthe Master by dropping seeds of truth in minds and hearts. Under\nthe influence of the Holy Spirit, these seeds will spring up to bear\nfruit for the glory of God, and will result in the saving of souls.\nThe students need not go to these institutions of learning in order\nto become enlightened upon theological subjects; for the teachers\nof the school need themselves to become Bible students. No open\ncontroversies should be started, yet opportunity will be given to ask\nquestions upon Bible doctrines, and light will be flashed into many\nminds. A spirit of investigation will be aroused.\nAttending Colleges and Universities of the Land 209\nA Procedure Fraught With Great Danger \u2014But I scarcely\ndare present this method of labor; for there is danger that those who\nhave no connection with God will place themselves in these schools,\nand instead of correcting error and diffusing light, will themselves\nbe led astray. But this work must be done, and it will be done by\nthose who are led and taught of God.\u2014Manuscript 22a, 1895.\n210 Selected Messages Book 3\nSection 7\u2014Standards [235]\nIntroduction[236]\nThe Christian must keep a continuous watch on the standards he\nor she holds. As we face the vicissitudes of living in a world with\ndeclining standards, and associate with church members who may\nbe measuring themselves among themselves, our own standards,\nonce held high, may imperceptibly slip.\nIf we are to look at the messages God has sent His people in\ntimes of old and in our time, we see how He found it necessary to\nrepeat and repeat encouragements to His people to walk in harmony\nwith His will. In our time this is particularly true of acceptable\nSabbath observance, dress and adornment, and health reform. Since\nthe issuance of the two preceding volumes of this series, some\nvaluable materials, along these lines, found here and there in Ellen\nWhite\u2019s manuscripts and letters of counsel, have been published in\nthe Adventist Review and are now put into book form here. Some\nmaterials from published sources have also been included in the four\nchapters of this section.\nThe chapter presenting a grouping of materials on \u201cThe Propriety\nof Varying Attitudes in Prayer\u201d seemed appropriate because some\nwould strain applications of the counsel found in Gospel Workers,\n178, 179, and Selected Messages 2:311-316, calling upon Seventh-\nday Adventists to kneel in prayer as a sign of reverence and humility.\nWhile the instruction calls for supplicants to kneel in both public\nworship and private devotions, Ellen White\u2019s clear-cut counsel and\nher example indicate that kneeling is not required in every instance\nwhen the heart and voice are lifted in prayer. The materials presented\nare drawn from a wide span of Ellen White\u2019s ministry.\nWhite Trustees.\n212\nChapter 27\u2014The Grace of Courtesy [237]\nThose who work for Christ are to be pure, upright, and trust-\nworthy, and they are also to be tenderhearted, compassionate, and\ncourteous. There is a charm in the intercourse of those who are truly\ncourteous. Kind words, pleasant looks, a courteous demeanor, are\nof inestimable value. Uncourteous Christians, by their neglect of\nothers, show that they are not in union with Christ. It is impossible\nto be in union with Christ and yet be uncourteous.\nWhat Christ was in His life on this earth, that every Christian\nshould be. He is our example, not only in His spotless purity but in\nHis patience, gentleness, and winsomeness of disposition. He was\na firm as a rock where truth and duty were concerned, but He was\ninvariably kind and courteous. His life was a perfect illustration of\ntrue courtesy. He had ever a kind look and a word of comfort for the\nneedy and oppressed.\nHis presence brought a purer atmosphere into the home, and His\nlife was as leaven working amid the elements of society. Harmless\nand undefiled, He walked among the thoughtless, the rude, the\nuncourteous; amid the unjust publicans, the unrighteous Samaritans,\nthe heathen soldiers, the rough peasants, and the mixed multitude.\nHe spoke a word of sympathy here, and a word there, as He saw [238]\nmen weary, and compelled to bear heavy burdens. He shared their\nburdens, and repeated to them the lessons He had learned from\nnature of the love, the kindness, the goodness of God.\nHe sought to inspire with hope the most rough and unpromising,\nsetting before them the assurance that they might become blame-\nless and harmless, attaining such a character as would make them\nmanifest as children of God.\nIn Ministering to Unbelievers\u2014Though He was a Jew, Christ\nmingled with the Samaritans, setting at naught the Pharisaic customs\nof His nation. In face of their prejudices, He accepted the hospitality\nof this despised people. He slept under their roofs, ate with them\nat their tables, partaking of the food prepared and served by their\n213\n214 Selected Messages Book 3\nhands\u2014and taught in their streets, and treated them with the utmost\nkindness and courtesy.\nJesus sat as an honored guest at the table of the publicans, by\nHis sympathy and social kindliness showing that He recognized\nthe dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His\nconfidence. Upon their thirsty souls His words fell with blessed,\nlife-giving power. New impulses were awakened, and the possibility\nof a new life opened to these outcasts of society.\nA Powerful Argument for the Gospel \u2014The love of Christ\nmellows the heart and smooths all roughness from the disposition.\nLet us learn from Him how to combine a high sense of purity and\nintegrity with sunniness of temperament. A kind, courteous Chris-\ntian is the most powerful argument in favor of the gospel that can be\nproduced.\nThe conduct of some professing Christians is so lacking in kind-\nness and courtesy that their good is evil spoken of. Their sincerity\nmay not be doubted, their uprightness may not be questioned. But\nsincerity and uprightness will not atone for a lack of kindness and\ncourtesy. Such ones need to realize that the plan of redemption is a\nplan of mercy, set in operation to soften whatever is hard and rugged[239]\nin human nature. They need to cultivate that rare Christian courtesy\nwhich makes men kind and considerate to all. The Christian is to be\nsympathetic as well as true, pitiful and courteous as well as upright\nand honest.\nMen of the world study to be courteous, to make themselves as\npleasing as possible. They study to render their address and manners\nsuch that they will have the greatest influence over those with whom\nthey associate. They use their knowledge and abilities as skillfully\nas possible in order to gain this object. \u201cThe children of this world\nare in their generation wiser than the children of light.\u201d\nAs you go through life, you will meet with those whose lot is\nfar from easy. Toil and deprivation, with no hope for better things\nin the future, make their burden very heavy. And when pain and\nsickness is added, the burden is almost greater than they can bear.\nCareworn and oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief.\nWhen you meet with such ones, put your whole heart into the work\nof helping them. It is not God\u2019s purpose that His children shall shut\nthemselves up to themselves. Remember that for them as well as for\nGrace of Courtesy 215\nyou Christ died. In your dealing with them, be pitiful and courteous.\nThis will open the way for you to help them, to win their confidence,\nto inspire them with hope and courage.\nChrist\u2019s Grace Changes the Whole Man \u2014The apostle ex-\nhorts us, \u201cAs he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in\nall manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy; for I\nam holy.\u201d The grace of Christ changes the whole man, making the\ncoarse refined, the rough gentle, the selfish generous. It controls the\ntemper and the voice. Its outworking is seen in politeness and tender\nregard shown by brother for brother, in kind, encouraging words\nand unselfish actions. An angel-presence, is in the home. The life\nbreathes forth a sweet perfume, which as holy incense ascends to\nGod.\nLove is manifested in kindness, gentleness, forbearance, and\nlongsuffering. The expression of the countenance is changed. The [240]\npeace of heaven is revealed. There is seen a habitual gentleness, a\nmore than human love. Humanity becomes a partaker of divinity.\nChrist is honored by perfection of character. As these changes are\nperfected, angels break forth in rapturous song, and God and Christ\nrejoice over souls fashioned after the divine similitude.\nPleasant Tones and Correct Language\u2014We should accustom\nourselves to speak in pleasant tones; to use pure, correct language,\nand words that are kind and courteous. Kind words are as dew and\ngentle showers to the soul. The scripture says of Christ that grace\nwas poured into His lips, that He might \u201cknow how to speak a word\nin season to him that is weary.\u201d And the Lord bids us, \u201cLet your\nspeech be alway with grace,\u201d \u201cthat it may minister grace unto the\nhearers.\u201d\nSome with whom you are brought in contact will be rough and\nuncourteous, but because of this, do not be less courteous yourself.\nHe who wishes to preserve his own self-respect must be careful not\nto wound needlessly the self-respect of others. This rule should be\nsacredly observed toward the dullest, the most blundering.\nWhat God intends to do with these apparently unpromising ones,\nyou do not know. He has in the past accepted persons no more\npromising or attractive to do a great work for Him. His Spirit,\nmoving upon the heart, has aroused every faculty to vigorous action.\nThe Lord saw in those rough, unhewn stones precious material that\n216 Selected Messages Book 3\nwould stand the test of storm and heat and pressure. God sees not as\nman sees. He does not judge from appearances, but He searches the\nheart, and judges righteously.\nLet us be self-forgetful, ever on the watch to cheer others, to\nlighten their burdens by acts of tender kindness and deeds of un-\nselfish love. These thoughtful courtesies, beginning in the home,\nand extending far beyond the home circle, go far to make up the\nsum of life\u2019s happiness, and the neglect of them constitutes no small\nshare of life\u2019s wretchedness.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 69, 1902 (Published in\nThe Review and Herald, August 20, 1959.)\nChapter 28\u2014Dress and Adornment [241]\nBlessings of Proper Attire\nAppropriate, Modest, and Becoming \u2014In dress, as in all\nthings else, it is our privilege to honor our Creator. He desires\nour clothing to be not only neat and healthful, but appropriate and\nbecoming.\u2014Education, 248.\nWe should seek to make the best of our appearance. In the taber-\nnacle service, God specified every detail concerning the garments\nof those who ministered before Him. Thus we are taught that He\nhas a preference in regard to the dress of those who serve Him. Very\nspecific were the directions given in regard to Aaron\u2019s robes, for his\ndress was symbolic. So the dress of Christ\u2019s followers should be\nsymbolic. In all things we are to be representatives of Him. Our\nappearance in every respect should be characterized by neatness,\nmodesty, and purity.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 6:96.\nBy the things of nature [the flowers, the lily] Christ illustrates\nthe beauty that Heaven values, the modest grace, the simplicity, the\npurity, the appropriateness, that would make our attire pleasing to\nHim.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 289.\nThe dress and its arrangement upon the person is generally found [242]\nto be the index of the man or the woman.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJanuary 30, 1900.\nWe judge of a person\u2019s character by the style of dress worn. A\nmodest, godly woman will dress modestly. A refined taste, a culti-\nvated mind, will be revealed in the choice of a simple, appropriate\nattire....The one who is simple and unpretending in her dress and\nin her manners shows that she understands that a true woman is\ncharacterized by moral worth. How charming, how interesting, is\nsimplicity in dress, which in comeliness can be compared with the\nflowers of the field.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 17, 1904.\n217\n218 Selected Messages Book 3\nSound Guiding Principles\nIf the world introduce a modest, convenient, and healthful mode\nof dress, which is in accordance with the Bible, it will not change our\nrelation to God or to the world to adopt such a style of dress. Chris-\ntians should follow Christ and make their dress conform to God\u2019s\nWord. They should shun extremes. They should humbly pursue a\nstraightforward course, irrespective of applause or of censure, and\nshould cling to the right because of its own merits.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:458, 459.\nI beg of our people to walk carefully and circumspectly before\nGod. Follow the customs in dress so far as they conform to health\nprinciples. Let our sisters dress plainly, as many do, having the\ndress of good, durable material, appropriate for this age, and let\nnot the dress question fill the mind. Our sisters should dress with\nsimplicity. They should clothe themselves in modest apparel, with\nshamefacedness and sobriety. Give to the world a living illustration\nof the inward adorning of the grace of God.\u2014Manuscript 167, 1897\n(Published in Child Guidance, 414.)\nIndependence and the Courage to Be Right\nChristians should not take pains to make themselves a gazing-[243]\nstock by dressing differently from the world. But if, when following\nout their convictions of duty in respect to dressing modestly and\nhealthfully, they find themselves out of fashion, they should not\nchange their dress in order to be like the world; but they should\nmanifest a noble independence and moral courage to be right, if all\nthe world differ from them.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 1:458.\nRefining the Tastes\nTruth never makes men or women coarse, or rough or uncourte-\nous. It takes men in all their sin and commonness, separates them\nfrom the world, and refines their tastes, even if they are poor and\nuneducated. Under Christ\u2019s discipline, a constant work of refinement\ngoes on, sanctifying them through the truth. If they are tempted to\nexert one particle of influence that would lead away from Christ into\nthe way of the world, in pride, or fashion, or display, they speak\nDress and Adornment 219\nwords of resistance that will turn aside the enemy\u2019s power. \u201cI am\nnot my own,\u201d they say. \u201cI am bought with a price. I am a son, a\ndaughter of God.\u201d\u2014Letter 26, 1900.\nSimplicity in Dress\nAs I have seen many Sabbathkeeping Adventists becoming\nworldly in thought, conversation, and dress, my heart has been\nsaddened. The people who claim to believe that they have the last\nmessage of mercy to give to the world, are attracted by worldly fash-\nions, and make great exertions to follow them as far as they think\ntheir profession of faith allows them to go. Worldly dress among\nour people is so noticeable that unbelievers frequently remark, \u201cIn\ntheir dress you cannot distinguish them from the world.\u201d This we\nknow to be true, although there are many exceptions.\nThose who meet the world\u2019s standard are not few in numbers. We\nare grieved to see that they are exerting an influence, leading others\nto follow their example. When I see those who have named the name [244]\nof Christ, aping the fashions introduced by worldlings, I have the\nmost painful reflections. Their lack of Christlikeness is apparent to\nall. In the outward adorning there is revealed to worldlings as well\nas to Christians an absence of the inward adorning, the ornament of\na meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price....\nHeart Condition Indicated \u2014We warn our Christian sisters\nagainst the tendency to make their dresses according to worldly\nstyles, thus attracting attention. The house of God is profaned by the\ndress of professedly Christian women of today. A fantastic dress, a\ndisplay of gold chains and gaudy laces, is a certain indication of a\nweak head and a proud heart.\nIn order to follow in the wake of fashion, many of our youth in-\ncur expenses which their condition in life does not justify. Children\nof poor parents seek to dress as do those who are wealthy. Parents\ntax their purses and their God-given time and strength in making\nand remodeling clothing to satisfy the vanity of their children. If our\nsisters who have abundance of means would regulate their expendi-\ntures, not in accordance with their wealth, but with regard to their\nresponsibility to God, as wise stewards of the means entrusted to\n220 Selected Messages Book 3\nthem, their example would do much to stay this evil now existing\namong us.\nSatan\u2019s Tactics\u2014Satan stands in the background, devising the\nfashions which lead to extravagance in the outlay of means. In form-\ning the fashions of the day, he has a fixed purpose. He knows that\ntime and money which are devoted to meet the demands of fashion\nwill not be used for higher, holier objects. Precious time is wasted in\nkeeping pace with ever-changing and never-satisfying fashions. No\nsooner is one style introduced than new styles are devised, and then,\nin order for fashionable persons to remain fashionable, the dress\nmust be remodeled. Thus professing Christians, with divided hearts,\nwaste their time, giving to the world nearly all their energies. [245]\nThis entirely unnecessary burden is taken up and willingly borne\nby our sisters. Half of their burdens come from an attempt to follow\nthe fashions; yet they eagerly accept the yoke, because fashion is\nthe god they worship. They are as truly held in shackles of bondage\nas is the veriest slave; and yet they talk of independence! They do\nnot know the first principles of independence. They have no mind\nor taste or judgment of their own.\nSatan is wonderfully successful in infatuating minds with the\never-varying styles of dress. He knows that while the minds of\nwomen are continually filled with a feverish desire to follow fashion,\ntheir moral sensibilities are weak, and they cannot be aroused to\nrealize their true spiritual condition. They are worldly, without God,\nwithout hope.\nTaste and Fitness and Durability\u2014We do not discourage taste\nand neatness in dress. Correct taste in dress is not to be despised\nor condemned. While needless ruffles, trimmings, and ornaments\nshould be left off, we encourage our sisters to obtain good, durable\nmaterial. Nothing is gained in trying to save means by purchasing\ncheap fabrics. Let the clothing be plain and neat, without extrava-\ngance of display.\nYoung ladies who break away from slavery to fashion will be\nornaments in society. The one who is simple and unpretending\nin her dress and in her manners shows that she understands that a\ntrue lady is characterized by moral worth.\u2014Manuscript 106, 1901\n(Republished in The Review and Herald, March 20, 1958.)\nDress and Adornment 221\nSelf-denial in dress is a part of our Christian duty. To dress\nplainly, abstaining from display of jewelry and ornaments of every\nkind, is in keeping with our faith. Are we of the number who see the\nfolly of worldlings in indulging in extravagance of dress as well as\nin love of amusements? If so, we should be of that class who shun\neverything that gives sanction to this spirit which takes possession of\nthe minds and hearts of those who live for this world only and who [246]\nhave no thought or care for the next.\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n3:366.\nWhere Are We Drifting?\nA sister who had spent some weeks at one of our institutions in\nBattle Creek said that she felt much disappointed in what she saw and\nheard there. She had thought to find a people far in advance of the\nyounger churches, both in knowledge of the truth and in religious\nexperience. Here she hoped to gain much instruction which she\ncould carry to her sisters in the faith in a distant State. But she was\nsurprised and pained at the lightness, the worldliness, and lack of\ndevotion which she met on every hand.\nBefore accepting the truth, she had followed the fashions of the\nworld in her dress, and had worn costly jewelry and other ornaments;\nbut upon deciding to obey the word of God, she felt that its teachings\nrequired her to lay aside all extravagant and superfluous adorning.\nShe was taught that Seventh-day Adventists did not wear jewelry,\ngold, silver, or precious stones, and that they did not conform to\nworldly fashions in their dress.\nWhen she saw among those who profess the faith such a wide\ndeparture from Bible simplicity, she felt bewildered. Had they not\nthe same Bible which she had been studying, and to which she had\nendeavored to conform her life? Had her past experience been mere\nfanaticism? Had she misinterpreted the words of the apostle, \u201cThe\nfriendship of the world is enmity with God, for whosoever will be a\nfriend of the world is the enemy of God\u201d?\nMrs. D., a lady occupying a position in the institution, was\nvisiting at Sister -----\u2019s room one day, when the latter took out of\nher trunk a gold necklace and chain, and said she wished to dispose\nof this jewelry and put the proceeds into the Lord\u2019s treasury. Said\n222 Selected Messages Book 3\nthe other, \u201cWhy do you sell it? I would wear it if it were mine.\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d replied Sister -----, \u201cwhen I received the truth, I was taught\nthat all these things must be laid aside. Surely they are contrary[247]\nto the teachings of God\u2019s Word.\u201d And she cited her hearer to the\nwords of the apostles, Paul and Peter, upon this point, \u201cIn like\nmanner, also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with\nshamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or\npearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing\ngodliness) with good works.\u201d \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that\noutward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of\nputting on of apparel. But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in\nthat which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit.\u201d\nIn answer, the lady displayed a gold ring on her finger, given\nher by an unbeliever, and said she thought it no harm to wear such\nornaments. \u201cWe are not so particular,\u201d said she, \u201cas formerly. Our\npeople have been over-scrupulous in their opinions upon the subject\nof dress. The ladies of this institution wear gold watches and gold\nchains, and dress like other people. It is not good policy to be\nsingular in our dress; for we cannot exert so much influence.\u201d\nConformity to Christ or the World \u2014We inquire, Is this in\naccordance with the teachings of Christ? Are we to follow the word\nof God or the customs of the world? Our sister decided that it was\nsafest to adhere to the Bible standard. Will Mrs. D. and others\nwho pursue a similar course be pleased to meet the result of their\ninfluence in that day when every man shall receive according to his\nworks?\nGod\u2019s word is plain. Its teachings cannot be mistaken. Shall we\nobey it, just as He has given it to us, or shall we seek to find how far\nwe can digress and yet be saved? Would that all connected with our\ninstitutions would receive and follow the divine light, and thus be\nenabled to transmit light to those who walk in darkness.\nConformity to the world is a sin which is sapping the spirituality\nof our people, and seriously interfering with their usefulness. It is\nidle to proclaim the warning message to the world, while we deny[248]\nit in the transactions of daily life.\u2014The Review and Herald, March\n28, 1882.\nDress and Adornment 223\n\u201cSelf, Self, Self, Must Be Served\u201d\nThose who have bracelets, and wear gold and ornaments, had\nbetter take these idols from their persons and sell them, even if it\nshould be for much less than they gave for them, and thus practice\nself-denial. Time is too short to adorn the body with gold or silver or\ncostly apparel. I know a good work can be done in this line. Jesus,\nthe Commander in the heavenly courts, laid aside His crown of\nroyalty and His royal robe and stepped down from His royal throne,\nand clothed His divinity with the habiliments of humanity, and for\nour sakes became poor, that we through His poverty might come\ninto possession of eternal riches, and yet the very ones for whom\nChrist has done everything that was possible to do to save perishing\nsouls from eternal ruin feel so little disposition to deny themselves\nanything that they have money to buy.\nThe Lord is soon to come, and His reward is with Him and His\nwork before Him to give every man according to his work. I try\nto set before the people that we are handling the Lord\u2019s money to\naccomplish the most important work that can be done. They can,\nindividually, through denial of self, do much more if all do a little,\nand the many little rivulets will make quite a current sent flowing\nheavenward.\nTrue, it is difficult for all to take in the situation. Self, self, self,\nmust be served and glorified, and how hard it is for all to become\nlaborers together with God. Oh, that a spirit of self-sacrifice might\ncome to every church, and thus every soul nigh and afar off might\nlearn the value of money, and use it while they can, and say, \u201cOf\nThine own, Lord, we give Thee\u201d (See 1 Chronicles 29:14).\u2014Letter\n110, 1896.\nWe have not time to give anxious thought as to what we shall eat\nand drink, and wherewithal we shall be clothed. Let us live simply, [249]\nand work in simplicity. Let us dress in such a modest, becoming\nway that we will be received wherever we go. Jewelry and expensive\ndress will not give us influence, but the ornament of a meek and\nquiet spirit\u2014the result of devotion to the service of Christ\u2014will\ngive us power with God. Kindness and forethought for those about\nus are qualities precious in the sight of heaven. If you have not given\n224 Selected Messages Book 3\nattention to the acquirement of these graces, do so now, for you have\nno time to lose.\u2014Manuscript 83, 1909.\nThe Clothes Seventh-day Adventist Ministers Wear\n[Reported as spoken before the General Conference of 1871.]\nEphesians 3:6, 7: \u201cThat the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and\nof the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the\ngospel: whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the\ngrace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power.\u201d\n\u201cWhereof I was made a minister,\u201d not merely to present the truth\nto the people, but to carry it out in the life.... But it is not this only.\nThere are other things to be considered, in which some have been\nnegligent, but which are of consequence, in the light in which they\nhave been presented before me....\nCarefulness in dress is an important item. There has been a lack\nhere with ministers who believe present truth. The dress of some has\nbeen even untidy. Not only has there been a lack of taste and order\nin arranging the dress in a becoming manner upon the person, and\nin having the color suitable and becoming for a minister of Christ,\nbut the apparel of some has been even slovenly. Some ministers\nwear a vest of a light color, while their pants are dark, or a dark vest\nand light pants, with no taste or orderly arrangement of the dress\nupon the person when they come before the people. These things\nare preaching to the people. The minister gives them an example\nof order, and sets before them the propriety of neatness and taste in[250]\ntheir apparel, or he gives them lessons in slackness and lack of taste\nwhich they will be in danger of following.\nAttire Appropriate for the Pulpit\u2014Black or dark material is\nmore becoming to a minister in the desk and will make a better\nimpression upon the people than would be made by a combination\nof two or three different colors in his apparel.\nI was pointed back to the children of Israel anciently, and was\nshown that God had given specific directions in regard to the material\nand style of dress to be worn by those who ministered before Him.\nThe God of heaven, whose arm moves the world, who sustains us\nand gives us life and health, has given us evidence that He may be\nDress and Adornment 225\nhonored or dishonored by the apparel of those who officiate before\nHim. He gave special directions to Moses in regard to everything\nconnected with His service. He gave instruction even in regard to\nthe arrangement of their houses and specified the dress which those\nshould wear who were to minister in His service. They were to\nmaintain order in everything....\nThat Right Impressions Might Be Made \u2014There was to be\nnothing slack and untidy about those who appeared before Him\nwhen they came into His holy presence. And why was this? What\nwas the object of all this carefulness? Was it merely to recommend\nthe people to God? Was it merely to gain His approbation?\nThe reason that was given me was this, that a right impression\nmight be made upon the people. If those who ministered in sacred\noffice should fail to manifest care, and reverence for God, in their\napparel and their deportment, the people would lose their awe and\ntheir reverence for God and His sacred service.\nIf the priests showed great reverence for God by being very\ncareful and very particular as they came into His presence, it gave the\npeople an exalted idea of God and His requirements. It showed them\nthat God was holy, that His work was sacred, and that everything\nin connection with his work must be holy; that it must be free from [251]\neverything like impurity and uncleanness; and that all defilement\nmust be put away from those who approach nigh to God.\nThe Minister\u2019s Dress and the Truth\u2014From the light that has\nbeen given me, there has been a carelessness in this respect. I might\nspeak of it as Paul presents it. It is carried out in will-worship and\nneglecting of the body. But this voluntary humility, this will-worship\nand neglecting of the body, is not the humility that savors of heaven.\nThat humility will be particular to have the person and actions and\napparel of all who preach the holy truth of God, right and perfectly\nproper, so that every item connected with us will recommend our\nholy religion. The very dress will be a recommendation of the truth\nto unbelievers. It will be a sermon in itself....\nA minister who is negligent in his apparel often wounds those\nof good taste and refined sensibilities. Those who are faulty in this\nrespect should correct their errors and be more circumspect. The loss\nof some souls at last will be traced to the untidiness of the minister.\nThe first appearance affected the people unfavorably because they\n226 Selected Messages Book 3\ncould not in any way link his appearance with the truths he presented.\nHis dress was against him; and the impression given was that the\npeople whom he represented were a careless set who cared nothing\nabout their dress, and his hearers did not want anything to do with\nsuch a class of people....\nThe Plane of Minister\u2019s Work Judged by his Dress \u2014Some\nwho minister in sacred things so arrange their dress upon their per-\nsons that, to some extent at least, it destroys the influence of their\nlabor. There is an apparent lack of taste in color and neatness of\nfit. What is the impression given by such a manner of dress? It\nis that the work in which they are engaged is considered no more\nsacred or elevated than common labor, as plowing in the field. The\nminister by his example brings down sacred things upon a level with\ncommon things. The influence of such preachers is not pleasing to\nGod.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 2:609-614.\nOn Making the Dress Question a Test[252]\nYour letter has been received and read.... The subject that you\nplace before me for counsel [the proposal to return to the reform\ndress advocated and worn in the late 1860\u2019s] is one that needs to be\ncarefully considered. Our sisters whose minds are agitated upon the\nsubject of again resuming the reform dress, should be prayerfully\ncautious in every move they make. We have now the most solemn,\nimportant tests given to us from the Word of God for this special\nperiod of time. This test is for the whole world. The Lord does\nnot require that any tests of human inventions shall be brought in to\ndivert the minds of the people or create controversy in any line.\nIt may be that some are thirsting for distinction in some way. If\nthey are thirsting for a battle with satanic agencies, let them be sure\nthat they first have on every piece of the armor of God. If they have\nnot, they will surely be worsted, and make for themselves grievous\ntrials and disappointments which they are not prepared to meet. Let\nall seek the Lord most earnestly for that deep and rich experience\nthat is to be found in the subject of heart preparedness to follow\nChrist where He shall lead the way.\n\u201cIf any man will come after me,\u201d He says, \u201clet him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow me.\u201d These words are to be weighed\nDress and Adornment 227\nwell. The man who wishes to follow Christ, who chooses to walk\nin His footsteps, will find self-denial and the cross in that path. All\nwho follow Christ will understand what this involves.\nDress Not to Be the Test Question \u2014God\u2019s tests are now to\nstand out plain and unmistakable. There are storms before us, con-\nflicts of which few dream. There is no need now for any special\nalteration in our dress. The plain simple style of dress now worn,\nmade in the most healthful way, demands no hoops, and no long\ntrails and is presentable anywhere, and these things should not come [253]\nin to divert our minds from the grand test which is to decide the\neternal destiny of a world\u2014the commandments of God and the faith\nof Jesus.\nWe are nearing the close of this world\u2019s history. A plain, direct\ntestimony is now needed, as given in the Word of God, in regard\nto the plainness of dress. This should be our burden. But it is too\nlate now to become enthusiastic in making a test of this matter. The\ndesire to follow Christ in all humility of mind, preparing the heart,\npurifying the character, is by no means an easy work. Our sisters\nmay be assured that the Lord has not inspired them to make a test\nof that which was once given as a blessing, but which by many was\nhated and despised as a curse.\nThe Reform Dress\u2014The reform dress, which was once advo-\ncated, [The \u201creform dress\u201d advocated and adopted in the 1860\u2019s\nwas designed by a group of SDA women in an attempt to provide\na healthful, modest, comfortable, and neat attire in harmony with\nthe light given Ellen White, which was much needed at the time.\nSee pp. 252-255. It called for loose-fitting garments hung from the\nshoulders with a hemline about nine inches from the floor. The lower\nlimbs were clothed with a trouserlike garment providing comfort and\nwarmth. See The Story of Our Health Message, 112-130.\u2014Compil-\ners.] proved a battle at every step. Members of the church, refusing\nto adopt this healthful style of dress, caused dissension and discord.\nWith some there was no uniformity and taste in the preparation of\nthe dress as it had been plainly set before them. This was food for\ntalk. The result was that the objectionable features, the pants, were\nleft off. The burden of advocating the reform dress was removed\nbecause that which was given as a blessing was turned into a curse.\n228 Selected Messages Book 3\nThere were some things that made the reform dress a decided\nblessing. With it the ridiculous hoops which were then the fashion,\ncould not possibly be worn. The long dress skirts trailing on the\nground and sweeping up the filth of the streets could not be patron-\nized. But a more sensible style of dress has now been adopted which\ndoes not embrace these objectionable features. The fashionable style\nof dress may be discarded and should be by all who will read the[254]\nWord of God. The time spent in advocating the dress reform should\nbe devoted to the study of the Word of God.\nThe dress of our people should be made most simple. The skirt\nand sacque I have mentioned may be used\u2014not that just that pattern\nand nothing else should be established, but a simple style as was\nrepresented in that dress. Some have supposed that the very pattern\ngiven was the pattern that all were to adopt. This is not so. But\nsomething as simple as this would be the best we could adopt under\nthe circumstances. No one precise style has been given me as the\nexact rule to guide all in their dress....\nSimple dresses should be worn. Try your talent, my sisters, in\nthis essential reform.\nThe people of God will have all the test that they can bear.\nThe Sabbath question is a test that will come to the whole world.\nWe need nothing to come in now to make a test for God\u2019s people\nthat shall make more severe for them the test they already have. The\nenemy would be pleased to get up issues now to divert the minds of\nthe people and get them into controversy over the subject of dress.\nLet our sisters dress plainly, as many do, having the dress of good\nmaterial, durable, modest, appropriate for this age, and let not the\ndress question fill the mind....\nThe Example Some Set\u2014There are those who with all the light\nof the Word of God will not obey His directions. They will follow\ntheir own tastes and do as they please. These give a wrong example\nto the youth, and to those who have newly come to the truth who\nhave made it a practise to copy every new style of dress in trimmings\nthat take time and money, and there is little difference between their\napparel and that of the worldling.\nLet our sisters conscientiously heed the word of God for them-\nselves. Do not begin the work of reform for others until you do; for\nyou will have no success; you cannot possibly change the heart. The[255]\nDress and Adornment 229\nworking of the Spirit of God inwardly will show a change outwardly.\nThose who venture to disobey the plainest statements of inspiration\nwill not hear and receive and act upon all the human efforts made to\nbring these idolaters to a plain, unadorned, simple, neat, proper dress\nthat does not in any way make them odd or singular. They continue\nto expose themselves by hanging out the colors of the world....\nOur whole term of probation is very brief, and a short work will\nbe done on the earth. God\u2019s own tests will come; His proving will\nbe sharp and decisive. Let every soul humble himself before God,\nand prepare for what is before us.\u2014Letter 19, 1897.\nChapter 29\u2014The Sabbath: Guiding Principles in[256]\nSabbath Observance\nThe Sabbath a Sign to the World of Loyalty\u2014From the pillar\nof cloud Jesus \u201cspake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it\nis a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye\nmay know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you\u201d (Exodus 31:12,\n13). The Sabbath is a pledge given by God to man\u2014a sign of the\nrelation existing between the Creator and His created beings. By\nobserving the memorial of the creation of the world in six days and\nthe rest of the Creator on the seventh day, by keeping the Sabbath\nholy, according to His directions, the Israelites were to declare to\nthe world their loyalty to the only true and living God, the Sovereign\nof the universe.\nBy observing the true Sabbath Christians are ever to bear to the\nworld faithful witness of their knowledge of the true and living God\nas distinguished from all false gods, for the Lord of the Sabbath is\nthe Creator of the heavens and the earth, the One exalted above all\nother gods.\n\u201cYe shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you....\nSix days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of\nrest, holy to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath[257]\nday, he shall surely be put to death. Wherefore the children of\nIsrael shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their\ngenerations, for a perpetual covenant. It is a sign between me and the\nchildren of Israel for ever: for in six days the Lord made heaven and\nearth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed\u201d (Verses\n14-17).\u2014Manuscript 122, 1901.\nEarly Counsel on the Sabbath and the Children\u2014The house\nof God is desecrated and the Sabbath violated by Sabbath believers\u2019\nchildren. They run about the house, play, talk, and manifest their\nevil tempers in the very meetings where the saints have met together\nto glorify God and to worship Him in the beauty of holiness. The\n230\nSabbath: Guiding Principles in Sabbath Observance 231\nplace that should be holy, where a holy stillness should reign, and\nwhere there should be perfect order, neatness, and humility, is made\nto be a perfect Babylon and a place where confusion, disorder, and\nuntidiness reign. This is enough to shut out God from our assemblies\nand cause his wrath to be kindled, that he will not be pleased to go\nout with the armies of Israel to battle against our enemies.\nGod would not give the victory in the ----- meeting. The enemies\nof our faith triumphed. God was displeased. His anger is kindled\nthat His house should be made like Babylon....\nAbove everything, take care of your children upon the Sabbath.\nDo not let them violate it, for you may just as well violate it yourself\nas to let your children do it. When you suffer your children to play\nupon the Sabbath, God looks upon you as a commandment breaker.\nYou transgress His Sabbath.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1854.\nNo Boisterous Noise and Confusion\u2014Come to the table with-\nout levity. Boisterous noise and contention should not be allowed\nany day of the week; but on the Sabbath all should observe quietness.\nNo loud-toned commands should be heard at any time; but on the\nSabbath it is entirely out of place. This is God\u2019s holy day, the day\nHe has set apart to commemorate His creative works, a day He has [258]\nsanctified and hallowed.\u2014Manuscript 57, 1897.\nSeeking Our Own Pleasure \u2014I say to those who claim to be\nSeventh-day Adventists, Can you claim the seal of the living God?\nCan you claim that you are sanctified by the truth? We have not, as\na people, given the law of God the preeminence as we should. We\nare in danger of doing our own pleasure on the Sabbath day.\u2014Letter\n258, 1907.\nNo Day for Pleasure Seeking, Swimming, or Ball Playing \u2014\nGod would have all his gifts appreciated. All fragments, jots, and\ntittles are to be treasured carefully, and we are carefully to become\nacquainted with the necessities of others. All that we have of Bible\ntruth is not merely for our benefit, but to impart to other souls, and\nthis is to be impressed upon human minds, and every kindly word\nspoken to prepare the way to make a channel through which the\ntruth will flow forth in rich currents to other souls.\nEvery working of Christ in miracles was essential, and was to\nreveal to the world that there was a great work to be done on the\nSabbath day for the relief of suffering humanity, but the common\n232 Selected Messages Book 3\nwork was not to be done. Pleasure seeking, ball playing, swimming,\nwas not a necessity, but a sinful neglect of the sacred day sanctified\nby Jehovah. Christ did not perform miracles merely to display His\npower, but always to meet Satan in afflicting suffering humanity.\nChrist came to our world to meet the needs of the suffering, whom\nSatan was torturing.\u2014Letter 252, 1906.\nSabbath Dishes\u2014We would charge all not to wash their dishes\non the Sabbath if this can possibly be avoided. God is dishonored by\nany unnecessary work done on His holy day. It is not inconsistent,\nbut proper, that the dishes should be left unwashed till the close of\nthe Sabbath, if this can be managed.\u2014Letter 104, 1901.\nThe Sabbath a Day of Service\u2014The first Sabbath of the week\nof prayer was a day of earnest activity. From \u201cSunnyside\u201d and the[259]\nschool, two teams and a boat were sent to Dora Creek to bring to the\nmeetings those who were not able to walk so far. The people had\nbeen invited to bring their lunch, and come to the meeting prepared\nto spend the day, and they responded freely to the invitation.\nSome were much surprised that we would exert ourselves on the\nSabbath to bring them to the meeting. They had been taught that Sun-\ndaykeeping consisted largely in physical inactivity; and they thought\nthat because we were zealous in the matter of Sabbathkeeping, we\nwould keep it according to the teachings of the Pharisees.\nWe told our friends that in the matter of keeping the Sabbath, we\nstudied the example and teachings of Christ whose Sabbaths were\noften spent in earnest effort to heal and to teach; that we believed\nthat one of our sisters who was nursing a sick family was keeping\nthe Sabbath as much as the one who was leading a division in the\nSabbath school; that Christ could not please the Pharisees of His\nday, and that we did not expect that our efforts to serve the Lord\nwould satisfy the Pharisees of our day.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nOctober 18, 1898.\nSacred and Secular Activities\u2014The priests in the temple per-\nformed greater labor on the Sabbath than upon other days.

There was much need of exalting the standard in this\nSabbath: Guiding Principles in Sabbath Observance 233\nplace in many respects before a correct and saving influence could\ngo forth to other places. As the truth has been presented here it has\ntaken persons from the world and from the churches and brought\nthem together in church capacity; but not all who have professed to\nbelieve the truth are sanctified through it....\nGod calls upon the workers in this mission to elevate the stan- [260]\ndard, and to show their regard for his requirements by honoring the\nSabbath.... From this place the publications are sent out, and the\nlaborers go forth to proclaim the commandments of God; and it is\nof the greatest importance that a right influence be exerted by this\nchurch, both by precept and example. The standard must not be\nplaced so low that those who accept the truth shall transgress God\u2019s\ncommandments while professing to obey them. Better, far better,\nwould it be to leave them in darkness until they could receive the\ntruth in its purity.\nSeventh-day Adventists Being Watched \u2014There are those\nwho are watching this people to see what is the influence of the\ntruth upon them. The children of this world are wiser in their gen-\neration than the children of light; when the claims of the fourth\ncommandment are set before them, they look to see how it is re-\ngarded by those who profess to obey it. They study the life and\ncharacter of its advocates, to learn whether these are in harmony\nwith their profession of faith; and upon the opinions thus formed\nmany are influenced very largely in the acceptance or rejection of\nthe truth. If this people will conform their lives to the Bible stan-\ndard, they will be indeed a light in the world, a city set upon a\nhill.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1885.\nThe Importance and Glory of the Sabbath\u2014Yesterday [Au-\ngust 10, 1851], which was Sabbath, we had a sweet, glorious time.\nThe Lord met with us and the glory of God was shed upon us and we\nwere made to rejoice and glorify God for His exceeding goodness\nunto us....

The Lord gave James liberty Sabbath\nafternoon in preaching upon the necessary preparation for baptism,\nand to partake of the Lord\u2019s Supper. There was much feeling in the\ncongregation. At intermission, all repaired to the water, where seven\nfollowed their Lord in baptism. It was a powerful season and of\nthe deepest interest. Two little sisters about eleven years old were\nbaptized. One, Cornelia C., prayed in the water to be kept unspotted\nfrom the world.\nIn the eve the church followed the example of their Lord and\nwashed one another\u2019s feet, and then partook of the Lord\u2019s Supper.\nThere was rejoicing and weeping in that house.

[The sincere Christian is often in prayer in public and in\nprivate. He prays while walking on the street, while engaged in his\nwork, and in the wakeful hours of the night. Ellen White counseled\nin a statement appearing in Gospel Workers, 178, that \u201cBoth in pub-\nlic and in private worship, it is our privilege to bow on our knees\nbefore the Lord when we offer our petitions to Him.\u201d The following\nstatement on this point, written in Australia and found in Selected\nMessages 2:312, is more emphatic: \u201cBoth in public and private\nworship it is our duty to bow down upon our knees before God when\nwe offer our petitions to Him. This act shows our dependence upon\nGod.\u201d It is also a sign of reverence: \u201cThere should be an intelligent\nknowledge of how to come to God in reverence and Godly fear with\ndevotional love.

She was not known\nto kneel for the benediction at the close of services she attended.\nThe earnest counsel on kneeling would seem to have its principal\napplication in the worship services in the house of God and in family\nand private devotions at home.

White published works deal-\ning with health and health reform, no one statement from her pen\nrecounts the giving of the early visions on this subject. These may\nbe noted as coming to her in 1848, 1854, and 1863. For information\nthat there was a vision touching health points in 1848 we must turn\nto a James White statement in The Review and Herald, November 8,\n1870, in which he declares:\n\u201cIt was twenty-two years ago the present autumn, that our minds\nwere called to the injurious effects of tobacco, tea, and coffee,\nthrough the testimony of Mrs. [White]....\n\u201cWhen we had gained a good victory over these things, and when\nthe Lord saw that we were able to bear it, light was given relative to\nfood and dress.\u201d\nThe broadening counsel on cleanliness and diet is found in a\ntestimony written in 1854. Specific reference to the June 6, 1863,\nhealth-reform vision is given in E. G. White answers to certain\nquestions published in The Review and Herald, October 8, 1867.\nThe growing interest in such details as are here revealed justifies\nthe inclusion of these items in this volume, even though they are\nsomewhat irregular in form.\nThe repeated statements of her nondependence on contemporary\nhealth writers are significant not only in a discussion of how the light\ncame to her on health reform but in a study of her work generally.\nThe 1881 statement on the proper use of the testimonies on\nhealth reform shows a careful balance in her work in teaching health\nprinciples.\nWhite Trustees.\n244\nChapter 31\u2014Visions That Early Called for Reforms [273]\nAttention Called to Tobacco, Tea, and Coffee in 1848 and 1851\nI have seen in vision that tobacco was a filthy weed, and that it\nmust be laid aside or given up. Unless it is given up, the frown of\nGod will be upon the one that uses it, and he cannot be sealed with\nthe seal of the living God.\u2014Letter 5, 1851. [James White in The\nReview and Herald, November 8, 1870, puts the time of the vision\nin the fall of 1848. See Introduction.]\nImportant Principles Revealed in 1854\nI then saw a lack of cleanliness among Sabbathkeepers. I saw\nthat God was purifying unto Himself a peculiar people. He will\nhave a clean and a holy people in whom He can delight. I saw\nthat the camp must be cleansed, or God would pass by and see the\nuncleanness of Israel and would not go forth with their armies to\nbattle. He would turn from them in displeasure, and our enemies\nwould triumph over us and we be left weak, in shame and disgrace.\nI saw that God would not acknowledge an untidy, unclean person\nas a Christian. His frown was upon such. Our souls, bodies, and\nspirits are to be presented blameless by Jesus to His Father, and\nunless we are clean in person, and pure, we cannot be presented [274]\nblameless to God.\nI saw that the houses of the saints should be kept tidy and neat,\nfree from dirt and filth and all uncleanness. I saw that the house of\nGod had been desecrated by the carelessness of parents with their\nchildren and by the untidiness and uncleanness there. I saw that\nthese things should meet with an open rebuke, and if there was not\nan immediate change in some that profess the truth in these things\nthey should be put out of the camp....\nThe Appetite and Proper Food\u2014I then saw that the appetite\nmust be denied, that rich food should not be prepared, and that which\nis spent upon the appetite should be put into the treasury of God. It\n245\n246 Selected Messages Book 3\nwould tell there and those that denied themselves would lay up a\nreward in heaven. I saw that God was purifying His people.\nPride and idols must be laid aside. I saw that rich food was\ndestroying the health of bodies, was ruining constitutions, destroying\nminds, and was a great waste of means.\nI saw that many were sickly among the remnant who have made\nthemselves so by indulging their appetites. If we wish good health,\nwe must take special care of the health that God has given us, deny\nthe unhealthy appetite, eat less fine food, eat coarse food free from\ngrease. [Careful examination and comparison of her writings seems\nto indicate that by \u201cgrease\u201d she meant animal fat such as lard and\nsuet. See Counsels on Diet and Foods, 353-355.] Then as you sit\nat the table to eat you can from the heart ask God\u2019s blessing upon\nthe food and can derive strength from coarse, wholesome food. God\nwill be pleased to graciously bless it and it will be a benefit to the\nreceiver.\nI saw that we should pray as Solomon did\u2014\u201cFeed me with food\nconvenient for me\u201d (Proverbs 30:8)\u2014and as we make the prayer, act\nit out. Get food that is plain and that is essential to health, free from\ngrease. Such food will be convenient for us.\nThere are some Sabbathkeepers who made a God of their bellies.[275]\nThey waste their means in obtaining rich food. Such, I saw, if\nsaved at all, will know what pinching want is unless they deny their\nappetites and eat to the glory of God. There are but few who eat to\nthe glory of God.\nHow can those who have cake and piecrust filled with grease\nask God\u2019s blessing upon it and then eat with an eye single to God\u2019s\nglory? We are commanded to do all to the glory of God. We must\neat and drink to his glory.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1854.\nChapter 32\u2014The 1863 Health Reform Vision [276]\nPointed Questions Answered\nQuestion on the Vision.\u2014Did you receive your views upon health\nreform before visiting the Health Institute at Dansville, New York,\n[The most prominent of medical institutions in the United States\nfeaturing reforms in diet and in the treatment of the sick was at\nthis time operated by Dr. James C. Jackson at Dansville, New\nYork,\u2014Compilers.] or before you had read works on the subject?\nAnswer\u2014It was at the house of Bro. A. Hilliard, at Otsego,\nMich., June 6, 1863, that the great subject of Health Reform was\nopened before me in vision.\nI did not visit Dansville till August, 1864, fourteen months after\nI had the view. I did not read any works upon health until I had\nwritten Spiritual Gifts, volumes 3 and 4, Appeal to Mothers, and had\nsketched out most of my six articles in the six numbers of How to\nLive.\nI did not know that such a paper existed as The Laws of Life ,\npublished at Dansville, N.Y . I had not heard of the several works\nupon health, written by Dr. J. C. Jackson, and other publications at\nDansville, at the time I had the view named above. I did not know\nthat such works existed until September, 1863, when in Boston,\nMass., my husband saw them advertised in a periodical called the [277]\nVoice of the Prophets, published by Eld. J. V . Himes. My husband\nordered the works from Dansville and received them at Topsham,\nMaine. His business gave him no time to peruse them, and as I\ndetermined not to read them until I had written out my views, the\nbooks remained in their wrappers.\nAs I introduced the subject of health to friends where I labored\nin Michigan, New England, and in the State of New York, and spoke\nagainst drugs and flesh meats, and in favor of water, pure air, and\na proper diet, the reply was often made, \u201cYou speak very nearly\nthe opinions taught in the Laws of Life, and other publications, by\n247\n248 Selected Messages Book 3\nDrs. Trall, Jackson, and others. Have you read that paper and those\nworks?\u201d\nMy reply was that I had not, neither should I read them till I had\nfully written out my views, lest it should be said that I have received\nmy light upon the subject of health from physicians, and not from\nthe Lord.\nAnd after I had written my six articles for How to Live, I then\nsearched the various works on hygiene and was surprised to find\nthem so nearly in harmony with what the Lord had revealed to me.\nAnd to show this harmony, and to set before my brethren and sisters\nthe subject as brought out by able writers, I determined to publish\nHow to Live, in which I largely extracted from the works referred to.\nHow the Dress Reform Was Revealed\n[For an informative presentation on the \u201creform dress\u201d adopted in\nresponse to this vision, and prevailing conditions which made such\na change desirable, see The Story of Our Health Message, 112-130.]\nQuestion\u2014Does not the practice of the sisters in wearing their\ndresses nine inches from the floor contradict testimony No. 11,\nwhich says they should reach somewhat below the top of a lady\u2019s\ngaiter boot?\nAnswer\u2014The proper distance from the bottom of the dress to\nthe floor was not given to me in inches.... But three companies of[278]\nfemales passed before me, with their dresses as follows with respect\nto length:\nThe first were of fashionable length, burdening the limbs, im-\npeding the step, and sweeping the street and gathering its filth; the\nevil results of which I have fully stated. This class, who were slaves\nto fashion, appeared feeble and languid.\nThe dress of the second class which passed before me was in\nmany respects as it should be. The limbs were well clad. They were\nfree from the burdens which the tyrant, Fashion, had imposed upon\nthe first class; but had gone to that extreme in the short dress as to\ndisgust and prejudice good people, and destroy in a great measure\ntheir own influence. This is the style and influence of the \u201cAmerican\nCostume,\u201d taught and worn by many at \u201cOur Home,\u201d Dansville, N.Y .\nHealth Reform Vision 249\nIt does not reach to the knee. I need not say that this style of dress\nwas shown me to be too short.\nA third class passed before me with cheerful countenances, and\nfree, elastic step. Their dress was the length I have described as\nproper, modest, and healthful. It cleared the filth of the street and\nsidewalk a few inches under all circumstances, such as ascending\nand descending steps, et cetera.\nAs I have before stated, the length was not given me in inches....\nRelation of the Vision to Writing and Practice\nAnd here I would state that although I am as dependent upon the\nSpirit of the Lord in writing my views as I am in receiving them,\nyet the words I employ in describing what I have seen are my own,\nunless they be those spoken to me by an angel, which I always\nenclose in marks of quotation.\nAs I wrote upon the subject of dress, the view of those three\ncompanies revived in my mind as plain as when I was viewing them\nin vision; but I was left to describe the length of the proper dress in\nmy own language as best I could, which I have done by stating that [279]\nthe bottom of the dress should reach near the top of a lady\u2019s boot,\nwhich would be necessary in order to clear the filth of the street\nunder the circumstances before named.\nI put on the dress, in length as near as I had seen and described as\nI could judge. My sisters in northern Michigan also adopted it. And\nwhen the subject of inches came up in order to secure uniformity\nas to length everywhere, a rule was brought and it was found that\nthe length of our dresses ranged from eight to ten inches from the\nfloor. Some of these were a little longer than the sample shown me,\nwhile others were a little shorter.\u2014The Review and Herald, October\n8, 1867.\nHealth Writings on June 6, the Day of the Vision\n[See Testimonies for the Church 3:13 for a portion of this.]\nI saw that now we should take special care of the health God\nhas given us, for our work was not yet done. Our testimony must\n250 Selected Messages Book 3\nyet be borne and would have influence. I saw that I had spent too\nmuch time and strength in sewing and waiting upon and entertaining\ncompany. I saw that home cares should be thrown off. The preparing\nof garments is a snare; others can do that. God has not given me\nstrength for such labor. We should preserve our strength to labor\nin His cause, and bear our testimony when it is needed. I saw that\nwe should be careful of our strength and not take upon ourselves\nburdens that others can and should bear.\nI saw that we should encourage a cheerful, hopeful, peaceful\nframe of mind, for our health depends upon our doing this. I saw that\nit was duty for everyone to have a care for his health, but especially\nshould we turn our attention to our health, and take time to devote\nto our health that we may in a degree recover from the effects of\noverdoing and overtaxing the mind. The work God requires of us\nwill not shut us away from caring for our health. The more perfect\nour health, the more perfect will be our labor.\nTo Observe and Teach Health Reform Principles\u2014I saw that[280]\nwhen we tax our strength, overlabor and weary ourselves much, then\nwe take colds and at such times are in danger of diseases taking a\ndangerous form. We must not leave the care of ourselves for God\nto see to and to take care of that which He has left for us to watch\nand care for. It is not safe nor pleasing to God to violate the laws of\nhealth and then ask Him to take care of our health and keep us from\ndisease when we are living directly contrary to our prayers.\nI saw that it was a sacred duty to attend to our health, and arouse\nothers to their duty, and yet not take the burden of their case upon us.\nYet we have a duty to speak, to come out against intemperance of\nevery kind,\u2014intemperance in working, in eating, in drinking and in\ndrugging\u2014and then point them to God\u2019s great medicine, water, pure\nsoft water, for diseases, for health, for cleanliness, and for a luxury.\nA Cheerful, Grateful Attitude\u2014I saw that my husband should\nnot suffer his mind to dwell upon the wrong side\u2014the dark, gloomy\nside. He should put from him saddening thoughts and saddening\nsubjects, and be cheerful, happy, grateful, and should have a firm\nreliance upon God and an unshaken confidence and trust in Him.\nHis health will be much better if he can control his mind. I saw that\nof all others my husband should have all the rest he can get [on]\nSabbath, when not preaching....\nHealth Reform Vision 251\nI saw that we should not be silent upon the subject of health but\nshould wake up minds to the subject.\u2014Manuscript 1, 1863.\nA Review in 1867 of the Writing on Health Reform\nDiseased minds have a diseased, sickly experience while a\nhealthy, pure, sound mind, with the intellectual faculties unclouded,\nwill have a sound experience which will be of inestimable worth.\nThe happiness attending a life of well-doing will be a daily reward\nand will of itself be health and joy. [281]\nI was astonished at the things shown me in vision. Many things\ncame directly across my own ideas. The matter was upon my mind\ncontinually. I talked it to all with whom I had opportunity to con-\nverse. My first writing of the vision was the substance of the matter\ncontained in [Spiritual Gifts] V olume IV and in [my six articles in]\nHow to Live, headed, \u201cDisease and Its Causes.\u201d\nWe were unexpectedly called to visit Allegan to attend a funeral\n[June 23, 1863], and then soon left for our eastern journey [Aug.\n19], intending to finish my book upon the journey. As we visited the\nchurches, things which had been shown to me in relation to existing\nwrongs required nearly all my time out of meeting in writing out the\nmatter for them. Before I returned home from the East I had written\nout about 500 pages for individuals and for churches.\nAfter we returned from the East [December 21, 1863], I com-\nmenced to write [Spiritual Gifts] V olume III, expecting to have a\nbook of a size to bind in with the testimonies which help compose\n[Spiritual Gifts] V olume IV . As I wrote, the matter opened before me\nand I saw it was impossible to get all I had to write in as few pages\nas I at first designed. The matter opened and V olume III was full.\nThen I commenced on V olume IV , [V olume IV continued the Old\nTestament history from the building of the sanctuary to Solomon,\n119 pages, followed by a 40-page chapter entitled \u201cHealth\u201d and then\nselections from the Testimonies, being a reprint of a major portion\nof Nos. 1 to 10, in all 160 pages.] but before I had my work finished,\nwhile preparing the health matter for the printers, I was called to go\nto Monterey. We went, and could not finish the work there as soon\nas we expected. I was obliged to return to finish the matter for the\nprinters, and we left an appointment for the next week.\n252 Selected Messages Book 3\nThese two journeys in hot weather were too much for my\nstrength. I had written almost constantly for above one year. I\ngenerally commenced writing at seven in the morning and continued[282]\nuntil seven at night, and then left writing to read proof sheets. My\nmind had been too severely taxed, and for three weeks I had not\nbeen able to sleep more than two hours in the night. My head ached\nconstantly.\nI therefore crowded into V olume IV the most essential points in\nthe vision in regard to health, intending to get out another testimony\nin which I could more freely speak upon the happiness and miseries\nof married life. With this consideration, I closed up V olume IV [Aug.\n23, 1864], that it might be scattered among the people. I reserved\nsome important matter in regard to health, which I had not strength\nor time to prepare for that volume, and get it out in season for our\n[1864] Eastern journey.\nWritten Independent of Books or Opinions of Others\nThat which I have written in regard to health was not taken from\nbooks or papers. As I related to others the things which I had been\nshown, the question was asked, \u201cHave you seen the paper,The Laws\nof Life or the Water Cure Journal?\u201d I told them No, I had not seen\neither of the papers. Said they, \u201cWhat you have seen agrees very\nmuch with much of their teachings.\u201d I talked freely with Dr. Lay and\nmany others upon the things which had been shown me in reference\nto health. I had never seen a paper treating upon health.\nAfter the vision was given me, my husband was aroused upon\nthe health questions. He obtained books, upon our Eastern journey,\nbut I would not read them. My view was clear, and I did not want\nto read anything until I had fully completed my books. My views\nwere written independent of books or of the opinions of others.\u2014\nManuscript 7, 1867.\nChapter 33\u2014Proper Use of the Testimonies on [283]\nHealth Reform\n[Written at Battle Creek, Michigan, March 23, 1881, and published\nin The Review and Herald, June 25, 1959.]\nI fully believe that the end of all things is at hand, and every\npower that God has given us should be employed in the very wisest\nand highest service to God. The Lord has brought out a people\nfrom the world to fit them not only for a pure and holy heaven,\nbut to prepare them through the wisdom he shall give them to be\nco-laborers with God in preparing a people to stand in the day of\nGod.\nGreat light has been given upon health reform, but it is essential\nfor all to treat this subject with candor and to advocate it with wis-\ndom. In our experience we have seen many who have not presented\nhealth reform in a manner to make the best impression upon those\nwhom they wish would receive their views. The Bible is full of wise\ncounsel, and even the eating and drinking receive proper attention.\nThe highest privilege that man can enjoy is to be a partaker of the\ndivine nature, and faith that binds us in strong relationship to God\nwill so fashion and mold mind and conduct that we become one with\nChrist. No one should through intemperate appetite so indulge his [284]\ntaste as to weaken any of the fine works of the human machinery\nand thus impair the mind or the body. Man is the Lord\u2019s purchased\npossession.\nIf we are partakers of the divine nature, we will live in commu-\nnion with our Creator and value all of God\u2019s work which led David\nto exclaim, \u201cI am fearfully and wonderfully made\u201d (Psalm 139:14).\nWe will not consider the organs of the body our own property, as\nif we had created them. All the faculties God has given to the hu-\nman body are to be appreciated. \u201cYe are not your own,\u201d \u201cfor ye are\nbought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your\nspirit, which are God\u2019s\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20).\n253\n254 Selected Messages Book 3\nWe are not to treat unwisely one faculty of mind, soul, or body.\nWe cannot abuse any of the delicate organs of the human body with-\nout having to pay the penalty because of transgression of nature\u2019s\nlaws. Bible religion brought into practical life ensures the highest\nculture of the intellect.\nTemperance is exalted to a high level in the Word of God. Obey-\ning His Word we can rise higher and still higher. The danger of\nintemperance is specified. The advantage to be gained by temper-\nance is laid open before us all through the Scriptures. The voice of\nGod is addressing us, \u201cBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father\nwhich is in heaven is perfect\u201d (Matthew 5:48).\nThe example of Daniel is presented for us to study carefully and\nlearn the lessons that God has for us to learn in this example given\nus in sacred history.\nGuard Against Extremes\nWe wish to present temperance and health reform from a Bible\nstandpoint, and to be very cautious not to go to extremes in abruptly\nadvocating health reform. Let us be careful not to graft into health\nreform one false shoot according to our own peculiar overstrained\nideas and weave into it our own strong traits of character making\nthese as the voice of God, and passing judgment on all who do not[285]\nsee as we do. It takes time to educate away from wrong habits.\nQuestions are coming in from brethren and sisters making in-\nquiries in regard to health reform. Statements are made that some are\ntaking the light in the testimonies upon health reform and making it\na test. They select statements made in regard to some articles of diet\nthat are presented as objectionable\u2014statements written in warning\nand instruction to certain individuals who were entering or had en-\ntered on an evil path. They dwell on these things and make them as\nstrong as possible, weaving their own peculiar, objectionable traits\nof character in with these statements and carry them with great force,\nthus making them a test, and driving them where they do only harm.\nProper Use of the Testimonies on Health Reform 255\nNeed of Moderation and Caution\nThe meekness and lowliness of Christ is wanting. Moderation\nand caution are greatly needed, but they have not these desirable\ntraits of character. They need the mold of God upon them. And\nsuch persons may take health reform and do great harm with it in\nprejudicing minds so that ears will be closed to the truth.\nHealth reform, wisely treated, will prove an entering wedge\nwhere the truth may follow with marked success. But to present\nhealth reform unwisely, making that subject the burden of the mes-\nsage, has served to create prejudice with unbelievers and to bar the\nway to the truth, leaving the impression that we are extremists. Now\nthe Lord would have us wise and understanding as to what is His\nwill. We must not give occasion for us to be regarded extremists.\nThis will place us and the truth God has given us to bear to the people\nat a great disadvantage. Through weaving in unconsecrated self,\nthat which we are ever to present as a blessing becomes a stumbling\nblock.\nWe see those who will select from the testimonies the strongest\nexpressions and, without bringing in or making any account of the\ncircumstances under which the cautions and warnings are given, [286]\nmake them of force in every case. Thus they produce unhealthy\nimpressions upon the minds of the people. There are always those\nwho are ready to grasp anything of a character which they can use\nto rein up people to a close, severe test, and who will work elements\nof their own characters into the reforms. This, at the very outset,\nraises the combativeness of the very ones they might help if they\ndealt carefully, bearing a healthful influence which would carry the\npeople with them. They will go at the work, making a raid upon\nthe people. Picking out some things in the testimonies they drive\nthem upon every one, and disgust rather than win souls. They make\ndivisions when they might and should make peace.\nDanger of Families Shown to Ellen White\nI have been shown the danger of families that are of an excitable\ntemperament, the animal predominating. Their children should not\nbe allowed to make eggs their diet, for this kind of food\u2014eggs and\n256 Selected Messages Book 3\nanimal flesh\u2014feeds and inflames the animal passions. This makes it\nvery difficult for them to overcome the temptation to indulge in the\nsinful practice of self-abuse which in this age is almost universally\npracticed. This practice weakens the physical, mental, and moral\npowers and bars the way to everlasting life.\nSome families were shown me as in a deplorable condition.\nBecause of this debasing sin, they are where the truth of God cannot\nfind access to heart or mind. This practice leads to deception, to\nfalsehood, to licentious practices, and to the corrupting and polluting\nof other minds, even of very young children. The habit once formed\nis more difficult to overcome than the appetite for liquor or for\ntobacco.\nThese evils, so prevalent, led me to make the statements that\nI have made. The special reproofs were presented in warning to\nothers; thus they come before other families than the very individuals\ncorrected and reproved. But let the testimonies speak for themselves.\nLet not individuals gather up the very strongest statements, given[287]\nfor individuals and families, and drive these things because they\nwant to use the whip and to have something to drive. Let these\nactive, determined temperaments take the Word of God and the\ntestimonies, which present the necessity of forbearance and love and\nperfect unity, and labor zealously and perseveringly. With their own\nhearts softened and subdued by the grace of Christ, with their own\nspirits humble and full of the milk of human kindness, they will not\ncreate prejudice, neither will they cause dissension and weaken the\nchurches.\nButter, Meat, and Cheese\nThe question whether we shall eat butter, meat, or cheese, is not\nto be presented to anyone as a test, but we are to educate and to\nshow the evils of the things that are objectionable. Those who gather\nup these things and drive them upon others do not know what work\nthey are doing. The Word of God has given tests to His people. The\nkeeping of God\u2019s holy law, the Sabbath, is a test, a sign between\nGod and His people throughout their generations forever. Forever\nthis is the burden of the third angel\u2019s message\u2014the commandments\nof God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.\nProper Use of the Testimonies on Health Reform 257\nTea, Coffee, Tobacco, and Alcohol\nTea, coffee, tobacco, and alcohol we must present as sinful\nindulgences. We cannot place on the same ground, meat, eggs,\nbutter, cheese, and such articles placed upon the table. These are not\nto be borne in front, as the burden of our work. The former\u2014tea,\ncoffee, tobacco, beer, wine, and all spiritous liquors\u2014are not to be\ntaken moderately, but discarded. The poisonous narcotics are not to\nbe treated in the same way as the subject of eggs, butter, and cheese.\nIn the beginning animal food was not designed to be the diet\nof man. We have every evidence that the flesh of dead animals [288]\nis dangerous because of disease that is fast becoming universal,\nbecause of the curse resting more heavily in consequence of the\nhabits and crimes of man. We are to present the truth. We are to\nbe guarded how to use reason and select those articles of food that\nwill make the very best blood and keep the blood in an unfevered\ncondition.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1881.\nA Work Which Discredits Health Reform\nThere will be some who will not leave the best and most correct\nimpression upon minds. They will be inclined to narrow ideas\nand plans, and have not the least idea of what constitutes health\nreform. They will take the testimonies which have been given for\nspecial individuals under peculiar circumstances, and make these\ntestimonies general and to apply in all cases, and in this way they\nbring discredit upon my work and the influence of the testimonies\nupon health reform.\u2014Letter 57, 1886.\nChapter 34\u2014Spiritual and Physical Hazards of[289]\nIndulged Appetite\nChanges Because of Use of Flesh Food\nThe flesh of dead animals was not the original food for man. Man\nwas permitted to eat it after the Flood because all vegetation had been\ndestroyed. But the curse pronounced upon man and the earth and\nevery living thing has made strange and wonderful changes. Since\nthe Flood the human race has been shortening its period of existence.\nPhysical, mental, and moral degeneracy is rapidly increasing in these\nlatter days.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1897.\nTaste in Judgment Corrupted\nYou know not the danger of eating meat merely because your\nappetite craves it. By partaking of this diet, man places in his mouth\nthat which stimulates unholy passions. Unhallowed emotions fill\nthe mind, and the spiritual eyesight is beclouded; for the tendency\nof self-gratification is to corrupt the taste and the judgment. By\nfurnishing your table with this kind of food, you go counter to the\nwill of God. A condition of things is brought about which will lead\nto a disregard of the precepts of God\u2019s law....\nBut it is not an easy matter to overcome hereditary and cultivated[290]\ntendencies to wrong. Self is masterful, and strives for the victory.\nBut to \u201chim that overcometh\u201d the promises are given. The Lord\npresents the right way, but He compels no one to obey. He leaves\nthose to whom He has given the light to receive or despise it, but their\ncourse of action is followed by sure results. Cause must produce\neffect....\nParents have a most solemn obligation resting upon them to\nconform to right habits of eating and drinking. Set before your chil-\ndren simple, wholesome food, avoiding everything of a stimulating\nnature. The effect which a meat diet has upon nervous children is\n258\nSpiritual and Physical Hazards of Indulged Appetite 259\nnot to make them sweet tempered and patient, but peevish, irrita-\nble, passionate, and impatient of restraint. Virtuous practices are\nlost, and corruption destroys mind, soul, and body.\u2014Manuscript 47,\n1896.\nSpiritual Health Sacrificed\nEating the flesh of dead animals is deleterious to the health of\nthe body, and all who use a meat diet are increasing their animal\npassions and are lessening their susceptibility of the soul to realize\nthe force of truth and the necessity of its being brought into their\npractical life.\u2014Letter 54, 1896.\nReligious and Physical Life Related\nEating the flesh of dead animals has an injurious effect upon\nspirituality. When meat is made the staple article of food, the higher\nfaculties are overborne by the lower passions. These things are an\noffense to God, and are the cause of a decline in spiritual life....\nWhatever we do in the line of eating and drinking should be done\nwith the special purpose of nourishing the body, that we may serve\nGod to His name\u2019s glory. The whole body is the property of God,\nand we must give strict attention to our physical well-being, for the\nreligious life is closely related to physical habits and practices.\u2014\nLetter 69, 1896.\nThe Lord has been teaching His people that it is for their spiritual [291]\nand physical good to abstain from flesh eating. There is no need to\neat the flesh of dead animals.\u2014Letter 83, 1901.\nThe Peril of Willing Ignorance\nWhat we eat and drink has an important bearing on our lives,\nand Christians should bring their habits of eating and drinking into\nconformity with the laws of nature. We must sense our obligations\ntoward God in these matters. Obedience to the laws of health should\nbe made a matter of earnest study; for willing ignorance on this\nsubject is sin. Each one should feel a personal obligation to carry\nout the laws of healthful living.\n260 Selected Messages Book 3\nTo Whom Do We Belong?\nMany turn away from the light, provoked because a word of\ncaution is given, and ask, \u201cMay we not do as we please with our-\nselves?\u201d Did you create yourselves? Did you pay the redemption\nprice for your souls and bodies? If so, you belong to yourselves.\nBut the Word of God declares, \u201cYe are bought with a price,\u201d \u201cthe\nprecious blood of Christ.\u201d The Word of God tells us plainly that our\nnatural habits are to be strictly guarded and controlled. \u201cAbstain\nfrom fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.\u201d Shall we do this?\nThe Word of God is perfect, converting the soul. If we diligently\nheed its precepts, we shall be conformed, physically and spiritually,\ninto the image of God.\u2014Letter 103, 1896.\nHindrances to Mental Improvement and Soul Sanctification\nGod requires continual advancement from His people. They need\nto learn that indulged appetite is the greatest hindrance to mental\nimprovement and soul sanctification. As a people, with all our pro-\nfession of health reform, we eat too much. Indulgence of appetite is[292]\nthe greatest cause of physical and mental debility, and lies largely at\nthe foundation of feebleness and premature death. Intemperance be-\ngins at our tables when we use an unwise combination of foods. Let\nthe individual who is seeking to possess purity of spirit bear in mind\nthat in Christ there is power to control the appetite.\u2014Manuscript 73,\n1908.\nAs we approach the close of this earth\u2019s history, selfishness,\nviolence, and crime prevail, as in the days of Noah. And the cause is\nthe same\u2014the excessive indulgence of the appetites and passions. A\nreform in the habits of life is especially needed at this time, in order\nto fit a people for the coming of Christ. The Saviour Himself warns\nthe church: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be\novercharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this life,\nand so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d\nHygienic reform is a subject that we need to understand in order\nto be prepared for the events that are close upon us. It is a branch\nof the Lord\u2019s work which has not received the attention it deserves,\nand much has been lost through neglect. It should have a prominent\nSpiritual and Physical Hazards of Indulged Appetite 261\nplace; it is not a matter to be trifled with, to be passed over as non-\nessential, or to be treated as a jest. If the church would manifest\na greater interest in this reform, their influence for good would be\ngreatly increased.\nFor those who are looking for the coming of the Lord, for those\nwho are called to be laborers in His vineyard\u2014for all who are\nfitting themselves for a place in the everlasting kingdom\u2014how\nimportant that the brain be clear, and the body as free as possible\nfrom disease.\u2014Manuscript 59, 1890.\nChapter 35\u2014Teaching Health Reform in the Family[293]\nConsistency of Parents With Children at the Dining Table\nOur work now is a very solemn, earnest work. We cannot evade\nit. There is the greatest necessity of education in more lines than\none. The one great need with you both is to feel that you must be\nunder supervision to God. You are His property. Your children\nare His property to be trained as younger members of the Lord\u2019s\nfamily, not to consider themselves to be especially indulged in any\nwhim and denied nothing. Were you an observer of the same plan of\ndiscipline you see others pursuing in managing their children, you\nwould criticize them severely.\nAnd again, do not indulge yourselves in sitting at the table spread\nwith a large variety of food, and because you enjoy these things, eat\nthem before your children and say, No, you cannot have this. You\ncannot have that, it will hurt you, while you eat largely of the very\nthings you forbid them to touch. Your discipline in this line needs\nthe reformation and the principle of practice.\nIt is cruelty to sit down yourself to the third meal, and take\nsatisfaction in talking and enjoying yourselves while you have your\nchildren sit by and eat nothing, representing the excellent discipline\nyour children are under to let them watch your eating and not rebel\nagainst your authority. They do rebel. They are young now, but to[294]\ncontinue this kind of discipline will spoil your authority.\nUrging Children to Overeat\nThen again you seem to fear when your children are at the\ntable that they will not eat enough and urge them to eat and to\ndrink. You need not have the slightest concern and show the anxiety\nyou have manifested lest they shall not eat sufficiently. Their little\nstomachs are small and cannot hold a large amount. Better far let\nthem have three meals than two for this reason. You let them have a\n262\nTeaching Health Reform in the Family 263\nlarge amount of food at one meal. The foundation is being laid for\ndistention of the stomach, which results in dyspepsia.\nTo eat and to drink that which is not agreeable to them is not\nwisdom. And again, be sure and set before them the very food you\ndesire they shall eat. That which is of a healthful quality of food for\nthem is healthful for you. But the quantity of even healthful food\nshould be carefully studied, so as not to introduce into the stomach\ntoo large a quantity at one meal. We must ourselves be temperate in\nall things, if we would give the proper lessons to our children. When\nthey are older any inconsideration on your part is marked.\u2014Letter\n12, 1884.\nEstablish No One Rule\nNo eating should be allowed between our meals. I have eaten\ntwo meals each day for the last twenty-five years. I do not use butter\nmyself, but some of my workers who sit at my table eat butter. They\ncannot take care of milk; it sours on the stomach, while they can\ntake care of a small quantity of butter.\nWe cannot regulate the diet question by making any rule. Some\ncan eat beans and dried peas, but to me this diet is painful. It is\nlike poison. Some have appetites and taste for certain things, and\nassimilate them well. Others have no appetite for these articles. So\none rule cannot be made for everyone.\u2014Manuscript 15, 1889.\nChapter 36\u2014Sister White and Prayer for the Sick[295]\nThe question has been asked by some, \u201cHas Sister White healed\nthe sick?\u201d I answer, \u201cNo, no; Sister White has often been called\nto pray for the sick, and to anoint them with oil in the name of the\nLord Jesus, and with them she has claimed the fulfillment of the\npromise, \u2018The prayer of faith shall save the sick.\u2019\u201d No human power\ncan save the sick, but, through the prayer of faith, the Mighty Healer\nhas fulfilled His promise to those who have called upon His name.\nNo human power can pardon sin or save the sinner. None can do\nthis but Christ, the merciful physician of body and soul.\nIt has often been my privilege to pray with the sick. We should\ndo this much more often than we do. If more prayer were offered\nin our sanitariums for the healing of the sick, the mighty power of\nthe Healer would be seen. Many more would be strengthened and\nblessed, and many more acute sicknesses would be healed.\nThe power of Christ to stay disease has been revealed in the\npast in a remarkable manner. Before we were blessed with insti-\ntutions where the sick could get help from suffering, by diligent\ntreatment and earnest prayer in faith to God, we carried the most\nseemingly hopeless cases through successfully. Today the Lord\ninvites the suffering ones to have faith in Him. Man\u2019s necessity is[296]\nGod\u2019s opportunity [Mark 6:1-5 quoted]....\nSimple Fervent Prayer to Accompany Treatment\nWith all our treatments given to the sick, simple fervent prayer\nshould be offered for the blessing of healing. We are to point the\nsick to the compassionate Saviour, and His power to forgive and to\nheal. Through His gracious providence they may be restored. Point\nthe sufferers to their Advocate in the heavenly courts. Tell them that\nChrist will heal the sick, if they will repent and cease to transgress\nthe laws of God. There is a Saviour who will reveal Himself in our\nsanitariums to save those who will submit themselves to Him. The\n264\nSister White and Prayer for the Sick 265\nsuffering ones can unite with you in prayer, confessing their sin, and\nreceiving pardon.\nIt Is Christ Who Heals \u2014Sister White has never claimed to\nheal the sick. It is Christ who has healed in every instance, as it was\nChrist who in the days of His ministry raised the dead to life. It is\nChrist who performs every mighty work through the ministry of His\nservants. This Christ is to be trusted and believed in. His blessing\nupon the means used for restoration to health will bring success.\nThe mercy of Christ delights to manifest itself in behalf of suffering\nhumanity. It is He who imparts the ministration of healing to the\nsick, and physicians are to give to Him the glory for the wonderful\nworks performed.\u2014Letter 158, 1908.\n266 Selected Messages Book 3\nSection 9\u2014Counsels on Many Matters [297]\nIntroduction[298]\nFor one reason or another various lines of Ellen White\u2019s counsel\nhave through the years come to the front and demanded our attention.\nThese range from light on a few points of gardening to sinlessness\nand salvation. All seemed appropriate for inclusion in a book of\nSelected Messages. They fill this section but can be given no more\nthan the barest touch of organization.\nWhile most of the items will interest and be of service to nearly\nall readers, attention is called particularly to several of the last items,\nincluding \u201cDisparaging the Pioneers\u201d and \u201cAttacks on Ellen White\nand Her Work.\u201d Had space allowed, other items might have been\nincluded.\nWhite Trustees.\n268\nChapter 37\u2014Seventh-day Adventists and Lawsuits [299]\nOpening Church Difficulties to Unbelievers\u2014When troubles\narise in the church we should not go for help to lawyers not of our\nfaith. God does not desire us to open church difficulties before those\nwho do not fear Him. He would not have us depend for help on\nthose who do not obey His requirements. Those who trust in such\ncounselors show that they have not faith in God. By their lack of faith\nthe Lord is greatly dishonored, and their course works great injury\nto themselves. In appealing to unbelievers to settle difficulties in the\nchurch they are biting and devouring one another, to be \u201cconsumed\none of another\u201d (Galatians 5:15).\nThese men cast aside the counsel God has given, and do the\nvery things He has bidden them not to do. They show that they\nhave chosen the world as their judge, and in heaven their names are\nregistered as one with unbelievers. Christ is crucified afresh, and\nput to open shame. Let these men know that God does not hear their\nprayers. They insult His holy name, and He will leave them to the\nbuffetings of Satan until they shall see their folly and seek the Lord\nby confession of their sin.\nMatters connected with the church are to be kept within its [300]\nown borders. If a Christian is abused, he is to take it patiently; if\ndefrauded, he is not to appeal to courts of justice. Rather let him\nsuffer loss and wrong.\nGod will deal with the unworthy church member who defrauds\nhis brother or the cause of God; the Christian need not contend for\nhis rights. God will deal with the one who violates these rights.\n\u201cVengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\u201d Romans 12:19.\nAn account is kept of all these matters, and for all the Lord declares\nthat He will avenge. He will bring every work into judgment.\n269\n270 Selected Messages Book 3\nUnsafe Counselors\nThe interests of the cause of God are not to be committed to men\nwho have no connection with heaven. Those who are disloyal to\nGod cannot be safe counselors. They have not that wisdom which\ncomes from above. They are not to be trusted to pass judgment\nin matters connected with God\u2019s cause, matters upon which such\ngreat results depend. If we follow their judgment, we shall surely be\nbrought into very difficult places, and shall retard the work of God.\nThose who are not connected with God are connected with the\nenemy of God, and while they may be honest in the advice they give,\nthey themselves are blinded and deceived. Satan puts suggestions\ninto the mind and words into the mouth that are entirely contrary to\nthe mind and will of God. Thus he works through them to allure us\ninto false paths. He will mislead, entangle, and ruin us if he can.\nAnciently it was a great sin for the people of God to give them-\nselves away to the enemy, and open before them either their per-\nplexity or their prosperity. Under the ancient economy it was a sin\nto offer sacrifice upon the wrong altar. It was a sin to offer incense\nkindled by the wrong fire.\nWe are in danger of mingling the sacred and the common. The\nholy fire from God is to be used in our efforts. The true altar is\nChrist; the true fire is the Holy Spirit. This is our inspiration. It[301]\nis only as the Holy Spirit leads and guides a man that he is a safe\ncounselor. If we turn aside from God and from His chosen ones\nto inquire at strange altars we shall be answered according to our\nworks.\nLet us show perfect trust in our Leader. Let us seek wisdom from\nthe Fountain of wisdom. In every perplexing or trying situation, let\nGod\u2019s people agree as touching the thing they desire, and then let\nthem unite in offering prayer to God, and persevere in asking for\nthe help they need. We are to acknowledge God in all our counsel,\nand when we ask of Him, we are to believe that we receive the very\nblessings sought.\u2014Manuscript 196, 1898.\nSeventh-day Adventists and Lawsuits 271\nCounsel to a Believer Threatening Lawsuits\nWhen you engaged in that lawsuit against R, I said if S has gone\nso far as to enter into that business, it will be a blot upon his life. I\nhave sorrowed because of your course in this; I know that it is not\nright, and will not in the least relieve the situation for you in any\nway. It is only a manifestation of that wisdom which is not from\nabove.\nI was informed that you intended to institute a suit against me,\non the ground that you had been wronged by the testimonies given\nin your case. A letter came to me, threatening that if I did not\nacknowledge that I had wronged you, the suit would be entered\nupon. Now, I could hardly believe that you had gone so decidedly\non the enemy\u2019s ground, knowing my lifework as well as you do.\nAll that I have written to you, every word of it, was the truth. I\nhave no retractions to make. I have done only that which I know to\nbe my duty to do. My only motive in publishing the matter was the\nhope of saving you. I had no thought but of sincere pity and love\nfor your soul. You yourself know that I have great interest for your\nsoul....\nIf anyone shall seek to hinder me in this work by appealing to the [302]\nlaw, I shall not abate one jot of the testimonies given. The work in\nwhich I am engaged is not my work. It is the work of God, which He\nhas given me to do. I did not believe that you would do so terrible a\nthing as to lift your finite hand against the God of heaven. Whoever\nshall do this work, let it not be you....\nI want to say to you, Do not extort money from anyone because\nof words spoken against you or yours. You harm yourself by so\ndoing. If we are looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our\nfaith, we shall be able to pray, \u201cLord, forgive us our trespasses, as\nwe forgive those who trespass against us.\u201d Jesus did not appeal to\nthe law for redress when He was unjustly accused. When He was\nreviled, He reviled not again; when He was threatened, He did not\nretaliate.\u2014Letter 38, 1891.\nThe Very Thing God Told Them Not to Do \u2014I have written\nlargely in regard to Christians who believe the truth placing their\ncases in courts of law to obtain redress. In doing this, they are\nbiting and devouring one another in every sense of the word, \u201cto be\n272 Selected Messages Book 3\nconsumed one of another.\u201d They cast aside the inspired counsel God\nhas given, and in the face of the message He gives they do the very\nthing He has told them not to do. Such men may as well stop praying\nto God, for He will not hear their prayers. They insult Jehovah, and\nHe will leave them to become the subjects of Satan until they shall\nsee their folly and seek the Lord by confession of their sins....\nWhat Appeals to the Courts Reveal \u2014The world and uncon-\nverted church members are in sympathy. Some when God reproves\nthem for wanting their own way, make the world their confidence,\nand bring church matters before the world for decision. Then there\nis collision and strife, and Christ is crucified afresh, and put to open\nshame. Those church members who appeal to the courts of the world\nshow that they have chosen the world as their judge, and their names\nare registered in heaven as one with unbelievers. How eagerly the[303]\nworld seizes the statements of those who betray sacred trusts!\nThis action, of appealing to human courts, never before entered\ninto by Seventh-day Adventists, has now been done. God has per-\nmitted this that you who have been deceived may understand what\npower is controlling those who have had entrusted to them great\nresponsibilities. Where are God\u2019s sentinels? Where are the men\nwho will stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, with the truth,\npresent truth for this time, in possession of the heart?\u2014Manuscript\n64, 1898.\nThe Saints to Judge the World\nThe saints are to judge the world. Then are they to depend upon\nthe world, and upon the world\u2019s lawyers to settle their difficulties?\nGod does not want them to take their troubles to the subjects of\nthe enemy for decision. Let us have confidence in one another.\u2014\nManuscript 71, 1903.\nLawyers and Laodiceans\nTo lean upon the arm of the law is a disgrace to Christians; yet\nthis evil has been brought in and cherished among the Lord\u2019s chosen\npeople. Worldly principles have been stealthily introduced, until in\npractice many of our workers are becoming like the Laodiceans\u2014\nSeventh-day Adventists and Lawsuits 273\nhalf-hearted, because so much dependence is placed on lawyers\nand legal documents and agreements. Such a condition of things is\nabhorrent to God.\u2014Manuscript 128, 1903.\nA Lawsuit Against the Publishing House\n\u201cDare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law\nbefore the unjust, and not before the saints? Do ye not know that\nthe saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by\nyou, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Know ye not\nthat we shall judge angels? how much more the things that pertain\nto this life? If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this [304]\nlife, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church. I speak\nto your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you?\nno, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? But\nbrother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.\nNow therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go\nto law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why\ndo ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? Nay, ye do\nwrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. Know ye not that the\nunrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?\u201d (1 Corinthians\n6:1-9).... When church members have this knowledge, their practice\nwill be of a character to recommend their faith. By a well-ordered\nlife, and godly conversation, they will reveal Christ. There will be\nno lawsuits between neighbors or brothers.\nI call upon you in the name of Christ to withdraw the suit that\nyou have begun and never bring another into court. God forbids\nyou thus to dishonor His name. You have had great light and many\nopportunities, and you cannot afford to unite with worldlings and fol-\nlow their methods. Remember that the Lord will treat you according\nto the stand that you take in this life....\nI tell you solemnly that if you take the action which you now\npurpose to take, you will never recover from the result of it. If you\nopen before the world the wrongs that you suppose your brethren\nhave done you, there will be some things that will have to be said on\nthe other side. I have a caution to give you.\nIn regard to the case of those who shared large responsibilities\nwith you in the Review and Herald, and who have turned to be\n274 Selected Messages Book 3\nenemies of the work, you will not wish to hear the verdict that shall\nbe passed upon them when the judgment shall sit and the books shall\nbe opened, and every man shall be judged according to the things\nwritten in the books. I want to save you from following a course\nthat would link you up with those who have linked themselves up\nwith fallen angels, to do all the harm they possibly can to those who\nlove God, and who, under great difficulty, are striving to proclaim[305]\npresent truth to the world.\nThe Publishing House Not Blameless\u2014Those against whom\nyou bring your charges know that I have not approved of their manner\nof dealing with you, and that I have reproved them for their unfeeling\nmanagement of your case. There are those who have not acted\nhonorably. They have not done as they would be done by. But\nbecause of this, should you, in the face of the warnings given, move\nso manifestly against the instruction given? I beg of you not to cut\nyourself off from the confidence of your brethren and from taking a\npart in the publishing work.\nI would rather share your loss than to have you push this matter\nthrough to the injury of your soul, giving Satan an opportunity to\npresent your case before unbelievers in a most ridiculous light, and\nto hold up the office of publication in a disparaging light....\nGod\u2019s Cause Injured\nTake this case out of the lawyers\u2019 hands. It seems awful to me to\nthink that you will go directly contrary to the plain word of God, and\nwill open to the world your cruel work against God\u2019s commandment-\nkeeping people. If this action of yours were to tell only against those\nwho have done injustice, the harm would not be so far-reaching; but\ncan you not see that it will arouse prejudice against God\u2019s people as\na body? Thus you will bruise and wound Christ in the person of His\nsaints, and cause Satan to exult because through you he could work\nagainst God\u2019s people and against His institutions, doing them great\nharm.\u2014Letter 301, 1905.\nChapter 38\u2014Science and Revelation [306]\n\u201cThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God.\u201d The mightiest\nintellects of earth cannot comprehend God. If he reveals Himself\nat all to men, it is by veiling Himself in mystery. His ways are past\nfinding out. Men must be ever searching, ever learning; and yet there\nis an infinity beyond. Could they fully understand the purposes,\nwisdom, love, and character of God, they would not believe in Him\nas an infinite being, and trust Him with the interests of their souls.\nIf they could fathom Him, he would no longer stand supreme.\nThere are men who think they have made wonderful discoveries\nin science. They quote the opinions of learned men as though they\nconsidered them infallible and teach the deductions of science as\ntruths that cannot be controverted. And the Word of God, which is\ngiven as a lamp to the feet of the world-weary traveler, is judged by\nthis standard, and pronounced wanting.\nThe scientific research in which these men have indulged has\nproved a snare to them. It has clouded their minds, and they have\ndrifted into skepticism. They have a consciousness of power; and\ninstead of looking to the Source of all wisdom, they triumph in the\nsmattering of knowledge they may have gained. They have exalted\ntheir human wisdom in opposition to the wisdom of the great and [307]\nmighty God, and have dared to enter into controversy with Him. The\nword of inspiration pronounces these men \u201cfools.\u201d\nThe Fruitage of Skepticism\nGod has permitted a flood of light to be poured upon the world\nin discoveries in science and art; but when professedly scientific\nmen lecture and write upon these subjects from a merely human\nstandpoint, they will assuredly come to wrong conclusions. The\ngreatest minds, if not guided by the Word of God in their research,\nbecome bewildered in their attempts to investigate the relations of\nscience and revelation. The Creator and His works are beyond their\n275\n276 Selected Messages Book 3\ncomprehension; and because they cannot explain these by natural\nlaws, Bible history is considered unreliable. Those who doubt the\nreliability of the records of the Old and New Testaments, will be\nled to go a step farther, and doubt the existence of God; and then,\nhaving let go their anchor, they are left to beat about upon the rocks\nof infidelity.\nMoses wrote under the guidance of the Spirit of God, and a\ncorrect theory of geology will never claim discoveries that cannot be\nreconciled with his statements. The idea that many stumble over, that\nGod did not create matter when He brought the world into existence,\nlimits the power of the Holy One of Israel.\nTest Science by God\u2019s Word \u2014Many, when they find them-\nselves incapable of measuring the Creator and His works by their\nown imperfect knowledge of science, doubt the existence of God\nand attribute infinite power to nature. These persons have lost the\nsimplicity of faith, and are removed far from God in mind and spirit.\nThere should be a settled faith in the divinity of God\u2019s Holy Word.\nThe Bible is not to be tested by men\u2019s idea of science, but science is\nto be brought to the test of this unerring standard. When the Bible\nmakes statements of facts in nature, science may be compared with\nthe Written Word, and a correct understanding of both will always[308]\nprove them to be in harmony. One does not contradict the other. All\ntruth, whether in nature or revelation, agrees.\nScientific research will open to the minds of the really wise vast\nfields of thought and information. They will see God in His works,\nand will praise Him. He will be to them first and best, and the mind\nwill be centered upon Him. Skeptics, who read the Bible for the sake\nof caviling, through ignorance claim to find decided contradictions\nbetween science and revelation. But man\u2019s measurement of God\nwill never be correct. The mind unenlightened by God\u2019s Spirit will\never be in darkness in regard to His power.\nSpiritual things are spiritually discerned. Those who have not\nvital union with God are swayed one way and another; they put\nmen\u2019s opinions in the front, and God\u2019s Word in the background.\nThey grasp human assertions, that judgment against sin is contrary\nto God\u2019s benevolent character, and, while dwelling upon infinite\nbenevolence, try to forget that there is such a thing as infinite justice.\nScience and Revelation 277\nWhen we have right views of the power, greatness and majesty of\nGod, and of the weakness of man, we shall despise the assumptions\nof wisdom made by earth\u2019s so-called great men, who have none of\nHeaven\u2019s nobility in their characters. There is nothing for which men\nshould be praised or exalted. There is no reason why the opinions\nof the learned should be trusted, when they are disposed to measure\ndivine things by their own perverted conceptions. Those who serve\nGod are the only ones whose opinion and example it is safe to follow.\nA sanctified heart quickens and intensifies the mental powers. A\nliving faith in God imparts energy; it gives calmness and repose of\nspirit, and strength and nobility of character.\nGod Can Work Above his Laws \u2014Men of science think that\nwith their enlarged conceptions they can comprehend the wisdom of\nGod, that which He has done or can do. The idea largely prevails\nthat He is bounded and restricted by His own laws. Men either deny [309]\nand ignore His existence, or think to explain everything, even the\noperations of His Spirit upon the human heart, by natural laws; and\nthey no longer reverence His name or fear His power. While they\nthink they are gaining everything, they are chasing bubbles, and\nlosing precious opportunities to become acquainted with God. They\ndo not believe in the supernatural, not realizing that the Author of\nnature\u2019s laws can work above those laws. They deny the claims of\nGod, and neglect the interests of their own souls; but His existence,\nHis character, His laws, are facts that the reasoning of men of the\nhighest attainments cannot overthrow.\nThe pen of inspiration thus describes the power and majesty of\nGod: \u201cWho hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and\nmeted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the\nearth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the\nhills in a balance? ... Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket,\nand are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh\nup the isles as a very little thing. And Lebanon is not sufficient\nto burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. All\nnations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less\nthan nothing, and vanity.... It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the\nearth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth\nout the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to\ndwell in\u201d (Isaiah 40:12-22).\n278 Selected Messages Book 3\nGod\u2019s Character Interpreted by His Works \u2014Nature is a\npower, but the God of nature is unlimited in power. His works\ninterpret His character. Those who judge Him from His handiworks,\nand not from the suppositions of great men, will see His presence in\neverything. They behold His smile in the glad sunshine, and His love\nand care for man in the rich fields of autumn. Even the adornments\nof the earth, as seen in the grass of living green, the lovely flowers\nof every hue, and the lofty and varied trees of the forest, testify to\nthe tender, fatherly care of our God, and to His desire to make His[310]\nchildren happy.\nThe power of the great God will be exerted in behalf of those that\nfear Him. Listen to the words of the prophet: \u201cHast thou not known?\nhast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator\nof the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no\nsearching of his understanding. He giveth power to the faint; and\nto them that have no might he increaseth strength. Even the youths\nshall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall. But\nthey that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall\nmount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary;\nand they shall walk, and not faint\u201d (Verses 28-31).\nIn the Word of God many queries are raised that the most pro-\nfound scholars can never answer. Attention is called to these subjects\nto show us how many things there are, even among the common\nthings of everyday life, that finite minds, with all their boasted wis-\ndom, can never fully comprehend.\nScience an Aid to Understand God \u2014All the systems of phi-\nlosophy devised by men have led to confusion and shame when God\nhas not been recognized and honored. To lose faith in God is terrible.\nProsperity cannot be a great blessing to nations or individuals, when\nonce faith in His Word is lost. Nothing is truly great but that which\nis eternal in its tendencies. Truth, justice, mercy, purity, and the love\nof God, are imperishable. When men possess these qualities, they\nare brought into close relationship to God, and are candidates for the\nhighest exaltation to which the race can aspire. They will disregard\nhuman praise, and will be superior to disappointment, weariness,\nthe strife of tongues, and contentions for supremacy.\nHe whose soul is imbued with the Spirit of God will learn the\nlesson of confiding trust. Taking the Written Word as his counselor\nScience and Revelation 279\nand guide, he will find in science an aid to understand God, but he\nwill not become exalted, till, in his blind self-conceit, he is a fool in\nhis ideas of God.\u2014The Signs of the Times, March 13, 1884. [311]\nThe precepts and principles of religion are the first steps in the\nacquisition of knowledge, and lie at the very foundation of true\neducation. Knowledge and science must be vitalized by the Spirit\nof God in order to serve the noblest purposes. The Christian alone\ncan make the right use of knowledge. Science, in order to be fully\nappreciated, must be viewed from a religious standpoint. Then all\nwill worship the God of science.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 30, 1896.\nGod the Designer and Creator\nWe need more to be shut in the audience with God. There is\nneed of guarding our own thoughts. We are surely living amid the\nperils of the last days. We must walk before God meekly, with deep\nhumility; for it is only such that will be exalted.\nO how little man can comprehend the perfection of God, His\nomnipresence united with His almighty power. A human artist\nreceives his intelligence from God. He can only fashion his work in\nany line to perfection from materials already prepared for his work.\nIn his finite power he could not create and make his materials to\nserve his purpose if the Great Designer had not been before him,\ngiving him the very improvements first in his imagination.\nThe Lord God commands things into being. He was the first\ndesigner. He is not dependent on man, but graciously invites man\u2019s\nattention, and cooperates with him in progressive and higher designs.\nThen man takes all the glory to himself, and is extolled by his fellow\nmen as a very remarkable genius. He looks no higher than man. The\none first cause is forgotten....\nI am afraid we have altogether too cheap and common ideas.\n\u201cBehold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee.\u201d\nLet not any one venture to limit the power of the Holy One of Israel.\nThere are conjectures and questions in regard to God\u2019s work. \u201cPut\noff thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest [312]\nis holy ground.\u201d Yes, angels are the ministers of God upon the earth,\ndoing His will.\n280 Selected Messages Book 3\nAll Things Stood Up Before Him at His Voice\u2014In the forma-\ntion of our world, God was not beholden to preexistent substance\nor matter. For the \u201cthings which are seen were not made of things\nwhich do appear.\u201d On the contrary, all things, material or spiritual,\nstood up before the Lord Jehovah at His voice, and were created for\nHis own purpose. The heavens and all the host of them, the earth\nand all things that are therein, are not only the work of His hand,\nthey came into existence by the breath of His mouth.\nThe Lord had given evidence that by His power He could in one\nshort hour dissolve the whole frame of nature. He can turn things\nupside down, and destroy the things that man has built up in his\nmost firm and substantial manner. He \u201cremoveth the mountains,\u201d\nHe \u201coverturneth them in his anger,\u201d He \u201cshaketh the earth out of her\nplace, and the pillars thereof tremble.\u201d \u201cThe pillars of heaven tremble\nand are astonished at his reproof.\u201d \u201cThe mountains quake at him, and\nthe hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence.\u201d\u2014Manuscript\n127, 1897.\nChapter 39\u2014Questions About the Saved [313]\nWill Children of Unbelieving Parents Be Saved?\n[See \u201cChildren in the Resurrection\u201d in Selected Messages 2:259,\n260, and \u201cComfort for a Bereaved Mother,\u201d in Child Guidance, 565,\n566.]\nI had some conversation with Elder [J.G.] Matteson in regard to\nwhether children of unbelieving parents would be saved. I related\nthat a sister had with great anxiety asked me this question, stating\nthat some had told her that the little children of unbelieving parents\nwould not be saved.\nThis we should consider as one of the questions we are not at\nliberty to express a position or an opinion upon, for the simple reason\nthat God has not told us definitely about this matter in His Word. If\nHe thought it was essential for us to know, He would have told us\nplainly.\nThe things He has revealed are for us and for our children. There\nare things we do not now understand. We are ignorant of many things\nthat are plainly revealed. When these subjects which have close\nrelation to our eternal welfare are exhausted, then it will be ample\ntime to consider some of these points that some are unnecessarily\nperplexing their minds about.\nChildren of Believing Parents\u2014I know that some questioned [314]\nwhether the little children of even believing parents should be saved,\nbecause they have had no test of character and all must be tested\nand their character determined by trial. The question is asked, \u201cHow\ncan little children have this test and trial?\u201d I answer that the faith\nof the believing parents covers the children, as when God sent His\njudgments upon the first-born of the Egyptians.\nThe word of God came to the Israelites in bondage to gather their\nchildren into their houses and to mark the doorposts of their houses\nwith blood from a lamb, slain. This prefigured the slaying of the Son\n281\n282 Selected Messages Book 3\nof God and the efficacy of His blood, which was shed for the salva-\ntion of the sinner. It was a sign that the household accepted Christ as\nthe promised Redeemer. It was shielded from the destroyer\u2019s power.\nThe parents evidenced their faith in implicitly obeying the directions\ngiven them, and the faith of the parents covered themselves and their\nchildren. They showed their faith in Jesus, the great Sacrifice, whose\nblood was prefigured in the slain lamb. The destroying angel passed\nover every house that had this mark upon it. This is a symbol to\nshow that the faith of the parents extends to their children and covers\nthem from the destroying angel.\nGod sent a word of comfort to the bereaved mothers of Bethle-\nhem that the weeping Rachels should see their children coming from\nthe land of the enemy. Christ took little children in His arms and\nblessed them and rebuked the disciples who would send away the\nmothers, saying, \u201cSuffer little children, and forbid them not, to come\nunto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 19:14).\nChrist blessed the children brought to Him by the faithful moth-\ners. He will do this now if mothers will do their duty to their children\nand teach their children and educate them in obedience and submis-\nsion. Then they will bear the test and will be obedient to the will of\nGod, for parents stand in the place of God to their children.\nUnruly Children of Adventist Parents\u2014Some parents allow[315]\nSatan to control their children, and their children are not restrained,\nbut are allowed to have wicked tempers, to be passionate, selfish,\nand disobedient. Should they die these children would not be taken\nto heaven. The parent\u2019s course of action is determining the future\nwelfare of their children. If they allow them to be disobedient and\npassionate they are allowing Satan to take them in charge and work\nthrough them as shall please his satanic majesty, and these children,\nnever educated to obedience and to lovely traits of character, will\nnot be taken to heaven, for the same temper and disposition would\nbe revealed in them.\nI said to Brother Matteson, \u201cWhether all the children of unbe-\nlieving parents will be saved we cannot tell, because God has not\nmade known His purpose in regard to this matter, and we had better\nleave it where God has left it and dwell upon subjects made plain in\nHis Word.\u201d\nQuestions About the Saved 283\nThis is a most delicate subject. Many unbelieving parents man-\nage their children with greater wisdom than many of those who claim\nto be children of God. They take much pains with their children,\nto make them kind, courteous, unselfish and to teach them to obey,\nand in this the unbelieving show greater wisdom than those parents\nwho have the great light of truth but whose works do not in any wise\ncorrespond with their faith.\nWill There Be a Certain Number? \u2014Another question upon\nwhich we had some conversation was in regard to the elect of God\u2014\nthat the Lord would have a certain number, and when that number\nwas made up then probation would cease. These are questions you\nor I have no right to talk about. The Lord Jesus will receive all who\ncome unto Him. He died for the ungodly and every man who will\ncome, may come.\nCertain conditions are to be complied with on the part of man,\nand if he refuses to comply with the conditions, he cannot become\nthe elect of God. If he will comply, he is a child of God, and Christ\nsays if he will continue in faithfulness, steadfast and immovable in [316]\nhis obedience, He will not blot out his name out of the book of life\nbut will confess his name before His Father and before His angels.\nGod would have us think and talk and present to others those truths\nwhich are plainly revealed, and all have naught to do with these\nsubjects of speculation, for they have no special reference to the\nsalvation of our souls.\u2014Manuscript 26, 1885.\nWill the Resurrected Recognize One Another?\nGod\u2019s greatest gift is Christ, whose life is ours, given for us. He\ndied for us, and was raised for us, that we might come forth from the\ntomb to a glorious companionship with heavenly angels, to meet our\nloved ones and to recognize their faces, for the Christlikeness does\nnot destroy their image, but transforms it into His glorious image.\nEvery saint connected in family relationship here will know each\nother there.\nWhen we are redeemed, the Bible will be understood in a higher,\nbroader, and clearer sense than it now is. The veil that has hung\nbetween mortality and immortality will be rent away. We shall see\nHis face.\u2014Letter 79, 1898.\nChapter 40\u2014The Question of the Date Line[317]\nThe Sabbath Made for a Round World\nGod rested on the seventh day, and set it apart for man to observe\nin honor of His creation of the heavens and the earth in six literal\ndays. He blessed and sanctified and made holy the day of rest. When\nmen are so careful to search and dig to see in regard to the precise\nperiod of time, we are to say, God made His Sabbath for a round\nworld; and when the seventh day comes to us in that round world,\ncontrolled by the sun that rules the day, it is the time in all countries\nand lands to observe the Sabbath. In the countries where there is no\nsunset for months, and again no sunrise for months, the period of\ntime will be calculated by records kept....\nThe Lord accepts all the obedience of every creature He has\nmade, according to the circumstances of time in the sun-rising and\nsun-setting world.... The Sabbath was made for a round world, and\ntherefore obedience is required of the people that are in perfect\nconsistency with the Lord\u2019s created world.\u2014Letter 167, 1900.\nThe Date Line Problem\nSister T has been speaking of you to me. She says that you are in\nsome confusion in regard to the day line. Now, my dear sister, this\ntalk about the day line is only a something that Satan has devised as a[318]\nsnare. He seeks to bewitch the senses, as he does in saying, \u201cLo, here\nis Christ, or there.\u201d There will be every fiction and devising of Satan\nto lead persons astray, but the word is, \u201cBelieve it not. For there shall\narise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs\nand wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive\nthe very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they\nshall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold,\nhe is in the secret chambers; believe it not\u201d (Matthew 24:23-26).\n284\nQuestion of the Date Line 285\nSeventh-day Sabbath Left in No Uncertainty \u2014We have the\npositive word of God in regard to the Sabbath [Exodus 31:12-18\nquoted].\nIs it possible that so much importance can be clustered about\nthose who observe the Sabbath, and yet no one can tell when the\nSabbath comes? Then where is the people who bear the badge or\nsign of God? What is the sign? The seventh-day Sabbath, which\nthe Lord blessed and sanctified, and pronounced holy, with great\npenalties for its violation.\nThe seventh-day Sabbath is in no uncertainty. It is God\u2019s memo-\nrial of His work of creation. It is set up as a heaven-given memorial,\nto be observed as a sign of obedience. God wrote the whole law\nwith His finger on two tables of stone....\nNow, my sister, ... I write ... to tell you that we are not to give the\nleast credence to the day line theory. It is a snare of Satan brought in\nby his own agents to confuse minds. You see how utterly impossible\nfor this thing to be, that the world is all right observing Sunday, and\nGod\u2019s remnant people are all wrong. This theory of the day line\nwould make all our history for the past fifty-five years a complete\nfallacy. But we know where we stand....\nTo Stand Fast by Our Colors \u2014My sister, let not your faith\nfail. We are to stand fast by our colors, the commandments of God\nand the faith of Jesus. All those who hold the beginning of their\nconfidence firm unto the end will keep the seventh-day Sabbath, [319]\nwhich comes to us as marked by the sun. The fallacy of the day line\nis a trap of Satan to discourage. I know what I am speaking about.\nHave faith in God. Shine where you are, as a living stone in God\u2019s\nbuilding.\nThe children of God will be triumphant. They will come off con-\nquerors and more than conquerors over all the opposing, persecuting\nelements. Fear not. By the power of Bible truth and love exemplified\nin the cross, and set home by the Holy Spirit, we shall have the\nvictory. The whole battle before us hinges upon the observance of\nthe true Sabbath of Jehovah....\nI can write no more now, but I say, Give no ear to heresy. Cling\nto a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d he will comfort and bless you, and\nwill give you joy in your heart. Praise the Lord that we have clear\nlight, and a plain, distinct message to bear.\u2014Letter 118, 1900.\nChapter 41\u2014Memorials, Are They Proper?[320]\nMemorials to Remind Us of Our History\nWhen Israel obtained special victories after leaving Egypt,\nmemorials were preserved of these victories. Moses and Joshua\nwere commanded of God to do this, to build up remembrances.\nWhen the Israelites had won a special victory over the Philistines,\nSamuel set up a commemorative stone and called it Ebenezer, saying,\n\u201cHitherto hath the Lord helped us\u201d (1 Samuel 7:12).\nOh, where, as a people, are our commemorative stones? Where\nare set up our monumental pillars carved with letters expressing\nthe precious story of what God has done for us in our experience?\nCan we not, in view of the past, look on new trials and increased\nperplexities\u2014even afflictions, privations, and bereavements\u2014and\nnot be dismayed, but look upon the past and say, \u201c\u2018Hitherto hath the\nLord helped us.\u2019 I will commit the keeping of my soul unto Him as\nunto a faithful Creator. He will keep that which I have committed\nto his trust against that day. \u2018As thy days, so shall thy strength\nbe.\u2019\u201d\u2014Manuscript 22, 1889.\nCall to Remember the Former Days\nThe dealings of God with His people should be often repeated.\nHow frequently were the waymarks set up by the Lord in His deal-[321]\nings with ancient Israel! Lest they should forget the history of the\npast, He commanded Moses to frame these events into song, that\nparents might teach them to their children. They were to gather up\nmemorials and to lay them up in sight. Special pains were taken\nto preserve them, that when the children should inquire concerning\nthese things, the whole story might be repeated. Thus the prov-\nidential dealings and the marked goodness and mercy of God in\nHis care and deliverance of His people were kept in mind. We are\nexhorted to \u201ccall to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye\nwere illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.\u201d Hebrews\n286\nMemorials, Are They Proper? 287\n10:32. For His people in this generation the Lord has wrought as a\nwonder-working God. The past history of the cause of God needs to\nbe often brought before the people, young and old. We need often\nto recount God\u2019s goodness and to praise Him for His wonderful\nworks.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 6:364, 365.\nChapter 42\u2014Renting Our Churches to Other[322]\nDenominations\nOne week ago last Sabbath, I filled an appointment to speak in\nthe church in San Francisco. We had an excellent meeting. There\nseemed to be an earnest desire to hear, and an interest in the words\nspoken.\nThis is the first time I had spoken in the San Francisco church\nsince long before the earthquake and fire. The building was in a\nmuch better condition than I expected to find it. The meeting room\nis large, and well kept. On the platform, and in front the floor is\ncarpeted with red Brussels. The carpet is well preserved and is kept\nlooking nice. The pulpit is well arranged.\nYour grandfather and I were the ones who worked up the plans\nfor erecting this building. A few others united with us, and we all\nworked together as best we could.\nThere are large, stained glass windows, which help to give a good\nappearance. The baptistry is nicely arranged. Back of the pulpit the\nwall swings back on hinges and the baptistry is thus brought into\nfull view of the audience. I cannot express my thankfulness that the\nLord preserved this large meetinghouse through the earthquake and\nthe fire. We appreciate it now very much.\nThe church is rented to the Presbyterians for services on Sunday.[323]\nThis makes it a little inconvenient for us at times, but as their meet-\ninghouse was destroyed, they feel very grateful for the privilege of\nusing ours.\nIn some of the lower rooms dispensary work is carried on, and\nthere are well-equipped treatment rooms. The work that has been\ndone here has been a blessing to many, especially since the fire.\u2014\nLetter 18a, 1906.\n288\nChapter 43\u2014Feelings of Despondency [324]\nEllen White Suffered Desponding Feelings\nYou ask me why it is that you awake in the night and feel enclosed\nin darkness? I often feel the same way myself; but these desponding\nfeelings are no evidence that God has forsaken you or me.... Gloomy\nfeelings are no evidence that the promises of God are of no effect.\nYou look at your feelings, and because your outlook is not all\nbrightness, you begin to draw more closely the garment of heaviness\nabout your soul. You look within yourself and think that God is\nforsaking you. You are to look to Christ....\nEntering into communion with our Saviour, we enter the region\nof peace.... We must put faith into constant exercise, and trust in God\nwhatever our feelings may be.... We are to be of good cheer, knowing\nthat Christ has overcome the world. We will have tribulation in the\nworld, but peace in Jesus Christ. My brother, turn your eyes from\nwithin, and look to Jesus who is your only helper.\u2014Letter 26, 1895.\nCounsel to a Despondent Sister\nIn my Christian experience I have passed over the ground where\nyou are now traveling. It seemed that I was bound in chains of\ndespair. When quite young, only about 12 years old, I was for [325]\nmonths utterly helpless. But the Lord did not suffer me to remain in\nthis condition. He attracted me by His own mercy and grace, and\nbrought me to the light. He will help you.\nLook away from yourself. Do not think or talk of yourself. You\ncannot save yourself by any good work that you may do. The Lord\nJesus has not made you a sin-bearer. He has not been able to find\nany human or angelic being to be a sin-bearer. He says, \u201cCome unto\nme, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d\nDo you not believe the words of Christ? He bids you, \u201cTake my\nyoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart;\n289\n290 Selected Messages Book 3\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my\nburden is light.\u201d\nThink of the Saviour. Lay your sins, both of omission and of\ncommission, upon the Sin-bearer. You know that you love the\nLord; then do not worry away your life because Satan harasses you\nwith his falsehoods. Believe that Jesus will and does pardon your\ntransgression. He bore the sins of the whole world. He loves to have\nthe weak and troubled soul come to Him and rely upon Him. Seek\nGod in simple faith, saying, \u201cI believe; help thou mine unbelief.\u201d\nAngels Minister to Trusting Souls\u2014The Lord does not readily\ncast off His erring children. He bears long with them. His angels\nminister to every believing, trusting soul. Now, when you read these\nwords, believe that the Lord accepts you just as you are, erring and\nsinful. He knows that you cannot blot out one sin; He knows that His\nprecious blood, shed for the sinner, makes that one who is troubled,\nworried, and perplexed, a child of God.\nThe Word of God is like a garden filled with beautiful, fragrant\nflowers. My sister, will you not pluck the flowers, the roses, the\nlilies, and the pinks of His promises? Rest in His love. No tongue\ncan express or finite mind conceive the greatness and richness of His\npromises for just such weak and trembling souls as you are. Simple[326]\nfaith and trust is your part; the Lord\u2019s part He never fails to fulfill.\nBy faith draw close to the precious Sin-bearer, and then cling to Him\nby faith. Do not worry; this will not help the matter at all. Believe\nthat Christ Himself rebukes the enemy, and that he can have no more\ncontrol over you. Believe that Satan has been rebuked. When the\nenemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up for\nyou a standard against him.\nTake Hold of Jesus and Never Let Go \u2014Again I bid you to\nlook away from yourself. Look to Jesus. Take hold of the Mighty\nOne, and never let go. Our Lord Jesus has expressed His love for\nyou in that He gave His own life that you might be saved; you must\nnot distrust that love. Do not look on the dark side. Be hopeful in\nGod. By beholding Jesus as your sin-pardoning Saviour you become\nchanged into His image. Say, \u201cI have asked my Saviour, He has set\nme free, and I am free indeed. I am the Lord\u2019s, and the Lord is mine.\nI will not fear. I know that He loves me in my infirmities, and I will\nnot make Him sorry by showing that I distrust Him. I break with the\nFeelings of Despondency 291\nenemy. Christ has cut the cords that bound me, and I will praise the\nLord.\u201d\nThus you can educate and strengthen your mind. May the Lord\nhelp and bless you every moment. Be free, yes, be free in the Lord\njust now. Rejoice in your freedom.\u2014Letter 36, 1900.\nLook Beyond the Shadows\nJesus lives; He has risen, He has risen, He is alive forevermore.\nDo not feel that you carry the load. It is true you wear the yoke,\nbut whom are you yoked up with?\u2014No less a personage than your\nRedeemer. Satan will cast his hellish shadow athwart your pathway;\nyou cannot expect anything else; but he cast the same dark shadow\nathwart the pathway of Christ. Now all you have to do is to look\nbeyond the shadow to the brightness of Christ.... Do not look at the\ndiscouragements; think of how precious is Jesus.\nYour memory will be renewed by the Holy Spirit. Can you [327]\nforget what Jesus has done for you? ... You were taken away from\nyourself; your deepest, sweetest thoughts were upon your precious\nSaviour, His care, His assurance, His love. How your desires went\nout to Him!\nAll your hopes rested upon Him, all your expectations were\nassociated with Him. Well, He loves you still; He has the balm that\ncan heal every wound and you can repose in Him....\nThe Comforter will be to you all that you desire. You will be\nweighted with the Spirit of God, and the importance of the message,\nand the work. I know that the Lord is willing to reveal to you\nwondrous things out of His law. Oh, let all take knowledge of you,\nthat you have been with Jesus.\u2014Letter 30a, 1892.\nFace the Light\u2014I will not allow my mind to dwell on the dark\nside. Jesus has light and comfort and hope and joy for me. I want to\nface the light, that the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness may\nshine into my heart, and be reflected to others. It is the duty of every\nChristian to shine\u2014to shed abroad the light of the grace that Christ\nimparts. God would have me, even in my pain, praise Him, showing\nthat I realize that His presence is with me. (Romans 5:1; 1 John 5:11\nquoted.)\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\nChapter 44\u2014Specific Light on Gardening[328]\nEllen G. White Instructed in Planting Fruit Trees\nWhile we were in Australia, we adopted the ... plan ... of digging\ndeep trenches and filling them in with dressing that would create\ngood soil. This we did in the cultivation of tomatoes, oranges,\nlemons, peaches, and grapes.\nThe man of whom we purchased our peach trees told me that he\nwould be pleased to have me observe the way they were planted. I\nthen asked him to let me show him how it had been represented in\nthe night season that they should be planted. I ordered my hired man\nto dig a deep cavity in the ground, then put in rich dirt, then stones,\nthen rich dirt. After this he put in layers of earth and dressing until\nthe hole was filled. I told the nurseryman that I had planted in this\nway in the rocky soil in America. I invited him to visit me when\nthese fruits should be ripe. He said to me, \u201cYou need no lesson from\nme to teach you how to plant the trees.\u201d\nOur crops were very successful. The peaches were the most\nbeautiful in coloring, and the most delicious in flavor of any that I\nhad tasted. We grew the large yellow Crawford and other varieties,\ngrapes, apricots, nectarines, and plums.\u2014Letter 350, 1907.\nThe Spraying of Fruit Trees[329]\nThere are those who say that nothing, not even insects, should\nbe killed. God has not entrusted any such message to His people. It\nis possible to stretch the command \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d to any limit;\nbut it is not according to sound reasoning to do this. Those who do\nit have not learned in the school of Christ.\nThis earth has been cursed because of sin, and in these last days\nvermin of every kind will multiply. These pests must be killed, or\nthey will annoy and torment and even kill us, and destroy the work of\nour hands and the fruit of our land. In places there are ants [termites]\nwhich entirely destroy the woodwork of houses. Should not these be\n292\nSpecific Light on Gardening 293\ndestroyed? Fruit trees must be sprayed, that the insects which would\nspoil the fruit may be killed. God has given us a part to act, and this\npart we must act with faithfulness. Then we can leave the rest with\nthe Lord.\nGod has given no man the message, Kill not ant or flea or moth.\nTroublesome and harmful insects and reptiles we must guard against\nand destroy, to preserve ourselves and our possessions from harm.\nAnd even if we do our best to exterminate these pests, they will still\nmultiply.\u2014Manuscript 70, 1901 (The Review and Herald, August\n31, 1961.)\nChapter 45\u2014Balanced Counsel on Picture-making[330]\nand Idolatry\n[See Selected Messages 2:318-320.]\nIt is a difficult matter for men and women to draw the line in\nthe matter of picture-making. Some have made a raid against pic-\ntures, daguerreo-types, and pictures of every kind. Everything must\nbe burned up, they say, urging that the making of all pictures is\nprohibited by the second commandment; that they are an idol.\nAn idol is anything that human beings love and trust in instead of\nloving and trusting in the Lord their Maker. Whatever earthly thing\nmen desire and trust in as having power to help them and do them\ngood, leads them away from God, and is to them an idol. Whatever\ndivides the affections, or takes away from the soul the supreme love\nof God, or interposes to prevent unlimited confidence and entire trust\nin God, assumes the character and takes the form of an idol in the\nsoul temple.\nThe first great commandment is, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy\nGod with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind\u201d\n(Matthew 22:37). Here is allowed no separation of the affections\nfrom God. In 1 John 2:15-17 we read, \u201cLove not the world, neither\nthe things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love [331]\nof the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of\nthe flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the\nFather, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust\nthereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.\u201d Now if\nthe pictures made have a tendency to separate the affections from\nGod, and are worshiped in the place of God, they are idols. Have\nthose who claim to be followers of Jesus Christ exalted these things\nabove God, and given their affections to them? Has their love for\ntreasures filled a place in their hearts that Jesus should occupy?\nHave those who have burned up all their pictures of friends and\nany kind of pictures they happened to have, come up to a higher\n294\nBalanced Counsel on Picture-making and Idolatry 295\nstate of consecration for this act, and do they seem in words, in\ndeportment, and in soul, to be ennobled, elevated, more heavenly-\nminded? Is their experience richer than before? Do they pray more,\nand believe with a more perfect faith after this consuming sacrifice\nwhich they have made? Have they come up into the mount? Has the\nholy fire been kindled in their hearts, giving new zeal and greater\ndevotion to God and His work than before? Has a live coal from\noff the altar of sacrifice touched their hearts and their lips? By their\nfruits you can tell the character of the work.\u2014Manuscript 50, 1886.\nChapter 46\u2014Music and the Music Director[332]\nSinging Drives Powers of Darkness Away\nI saw we must be daily rising and keep the ascendancy above the\npowers of darkness. Our God is mighty. I saw singing to the glory\nof God often drove the enemy [away], and praising God would beat\nhim back and give us the victory.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1850.\nWorldliness in Musical Lines\nIt is not safe for the Lord\u2019s workers to take part in worldly\nentertainments. Association with worldliness in musical lines is\nlooked upon as harmless by some Sabbathkeepers. But such ones\nare on dangerous ground. Thus Satan seeks to lead men and women\nastray, and thus he has gained control of souls. So smooth, so\nplausible is the working of the enemy that his wiles are not suspected,\nand many church members become lovers of pleasure more than\nlovers of God.\u2014Manuscript 82, 1900.\nI was shown the case of Brother U\u2014that he would be a burden\nto the church unless he comes into a closer relation with God. He is\nself-conceited. If his course is questioned he feels hurt. If he thinks\nanother is preferred before him, he feels that it is an injury done to\nhim....\nBrother U has a good knowledge of music, but his education in[333]\nmusic was of a character to suit the stage rather than the solemn\nworship of God. Singing is just as much the worship of God in a re-\nligious meeting as speaking, and any oddity or peculiarity cultivated\nattracts the attention of the people and destroys the serious, solemn\nimpression which should be the result of sacred music. Anything\nstrange and eccentric in singing detracts from the seriousness and\nsacredness of religious service.\nDignified, Solemn, Impressive Music\u2014Bodily exercise prof-\niteth little. Everything that is connected in any way with religious\nworship should be dignified, solemn, and impressive. God is not\n296\nMusic and the Music Director 297\npleased when ministers professing to be Christ\u2019s representatives so\nmisrepresent Christ as to throw the body into acting attitudes, mak-\ning undignified and coarse gestures, unrefined, coarse gesticulations.\nAll this amuses, and will excite the curiosity of those who wish to\nsee strange, odd, and exciting things, but these things will not elevate\nthe minds and hearts of those who witness them.\nThe very same may be said of singing. You assume undignified\nattitudes. You put in all the power and volume of the voice you can.\nYou drown the finer strains and notes of voices more musical than\nyour own. This bodily exercise and the harsh, loud voice makes no\nmelody to those who hear on earth and those who listen in heaven.\nThis singing is defective and not acceptable to God as perfect, soft-\nened, sweet strains of music. There are no such exhibitions among\nthe angels as I have sometimes seen in our meetings. Such harsh\nnotes and gesticulations are not exhibited among the angel choir.\nTheir singing does not grate upon the ear. It is soft and melodious\nand comes without this great effort I have witnessed. It is not forced\nand strained, requiring physical exercise.\nThe Feelings Not Touched, the Heart Not Subdued\u2014Brother\nU is not aware how many are amused and disgusted. Some cannot\nrepress thoughts not very sacred and feelings of levity to see the [334]\nunrefined motions made in the singing. Brother U exhibits himself.\nHis singing does not have an influence to subdue the heart and\ntouch the feelings. Many have attended the meetings and listened\nto the words of truth spoken from the pulpit, which have convicted\nand solemnized their minds; but many times the way the singing\nhas been conducted has not deepened the impression made. The\ndemonstrations and bodily contortions, the unpleasant appearance\nof the strained, forced effort has appeared so out of place for the\nhouse of God, so comical, that the serious impressions made upon\nthe minds have been removed. Those who believe the truth are not\nas highly thought of as before the singing.\nIt Must Be \u201cAll in His Way.\u201d \u2014Brother U\u2019s case has been a\ndifficult one to manage. He has been like a child undisciplined and\nuneducated. When his course has been questioned, instead of taking\nreproof as a blessing, he has let his feelings get the better of his\njudgment and he has become discouraged and would do nothing. If\nhe could not do in everything as he wanted to do, all in his way, he\n298 Selected Messages Book 3\nwould not help at all. He has not taken hold of the work earnestly to\nreform his manners but has given up to mulish feelings that separate\nthe angels from him and bring evil angels around him. The truth\nof God received in the heart commences its refining, sanctifying\ninfluence upon the life.\nBrother U has thought that singing was about the greatest thing\nto be done in this world and that he had a very large and grand way\nof doing it.\nYour singing is far from pleasing to the angel choir. Imagine\nyourself standing in the angel band elevating your shoulders, em-\nphasizing the words, motioning your body and putting in the full\nvolume of your voice. What kind of concert and harmony would\nthere be with such an exhibition before the angels?\nThe Power of Music \u2014Music is of heavenly origin. There is\ngreat power in music. It was music from the angelic throng that\nthrilled the hearts of the shepherds on Bethlehem\u2019s plains and swept[335]\nround the world. It is in music that our praises rise to Him who is\nthe embodiment of purity and harmony. It is with music and songs\nof victory that the redeemed shall finally enter upon the immortal\nreward.\nThere is something peculiarly sacred in the human voice. Its\nharmony and its subdued and heaven-inspired pathos exceeds every\nmusical instrument. V ocal music is one of God\u2019s gifts to men, an\ninstrument that cannot be surpassed or equaled when God\u2019s love\nabounds in the soul. Singing with the spirit and the understanding\nalso is a great addition to devotional services in the house of God.\nHow this gift has been debased! When sanctified and refined\nit would accomplish great good in breaking down the barriers of\nprejudice and hardhearted unbelief, and would be the means of\nconverting souls. It is not enough to understand the rudiments of\nsinging, but with the understanding, with the knowledge, must be\nsuch a connection with heaven that angels can sing through us.\nSofter, Silvery Strains Drowned Out \u2014Your voice has been\nheard in church so loud, so harsh, accompanied or set off with your\ngesticulations not the most graceful, that the softer and more silvery\nstrains, more like angel music, could not be heard. You have sung\nmore to men than to God. As your voice has been elevated in loud\nstrains above all the congregation, you have been thoughtful of the\nMusic and the Music Director 299\nadmiration you were exciting. You have really had such high ideas\nof your singing, that you have had some thoughts that you should be\nremunerated for the exercise of this gift.\nThe love of praise has been the mainspring of your life. This\nis a poor motive for a Christian. You have wanted to be petted and\npraised like a child. You have had much to contend with in your own\nnature. It has been hard for you to overcome your natural besetments\nand live a self-denying, holy life.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1874.\nChapter 47\u2014Work in the Spirit of Prayer[336]\nI feel an intense desire that this [the 1901 General Conference\nsession] shall be a meeting where God can preside. This is an\nimportant time, a very important time. There is a great work to\ndo. But whether the meeting shall be a success depends on us\nindividually. We can make a heaven here during this meeting....\nThere are solemn and important decisions to be made at this\nmeeting, and God wants every one of us to stand in right relation\nto Him. He wants us to do a great deal more praying and a great\ndeal less talking. He wants us to keep the windows of the soul\nopened heavenward. The threshold of heaven is flooded with the\nlight of God\u2019s glory, and God will let this light shine into the heart\nof everyone who at this meeting will stand in right relation to Him.\nSome have said that they thought that at this meeting several\ndays ought to be spent in prayer to God for the Holy Spirit, as at the\nday of Pentecost. I wish to say to you that the business which may\nbe carried on at this meeting is just as much a part of the service of\nGod as is prayer. The business meeting is to be just as much under\nthe dictation of the Spirit as the prayer meeting. There is danger\nof our getting a sentimental, impulsive religion. Let the business[337]\ntransacted at this meeting stand forth in such sacredness that the\nheavenly host can approve of it. We are to guard most sacredly the\nbusiness lines of our work. Every line of business carried on here is\nto be in accordance with the principles of heaven.\nGod wants you to stand in position where He can breathe upon\nyou the Holy Spirit, where Christ can abide in the heart. He wants\nyou at the beginning of this meeting to lay off whatever of contro-\nversy, of strife, of dissension, of murmuring, you have been carrying.\nWhat we need is a great deal more of Christ and none of self. The\nSaviour says, \u201cWithout me ye can do nothing.\u201d...\nWe have come to a point where God is going to work for His\npeople. He wishes them to be a representative people, distinct from\nall other peoples in our world. He wants them to stand on vantage\n300\nWork in the Spirit of Prayer 301\nground, because He gave His life that they might stand there. Do\nnot disappoint the Lord.\u2014Manuscript 29, 1901.\nToo Many Resolutions\nYour very many resolutions need to be reduced to one third their\nnumber, and great care should be taken as to what resolutions are\nframed.\u2014Letter 21a, 1888.\nI have been shown that our conferences have been overburdened\nwith resolutions. One tenth as many would be of far greater value\nthan a larger number. I stated these things clearly, but still you urged\nthat the resolution should be carried into effect.\u2014Letter 22, 1889.\nChapter 48\u2014The Bible Prophets Wrote for Our[338]\nTime\nNever are we absent from the mind of God. God is our joy and\nour salvation. Each of the ancient prophets spoke less for their own\ntime than for ours, so that their prophesying is in force for us. \u201cNow\nall these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are\nwritten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are\ncome\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:11). \u201cNot unto themselves, but unto us\nthey did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by\nthem that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost\nsent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into\u201d\n(1 Peter 1:12).\nThe Bible has been your study-book. It is well thus, for it is\nthe true counsel of God, and it is the conductor of all the holy\ninfluences that the world has contained since its creation. We have\nthe encouraging record that Enoch walked with God. If Enoch\nwalked with God, in that degenerate age just prior to the destruction\nof the world by a flood, we are to receive courage and be stimulated\nwith his example that we need not be contaminated with the world\nbut, amid all its corrupting influences and tendencies, we may walk\nwith God. We may have the mind of Christ.\nTreasures for the Last Generation[339]\nEnoch, the seventh from Adam, was ever prophesying the com-\ning of the Lord. This great event had been revealed to him in vision.\nAbel, though dead, is ever speaking of the blood of Christ which\nalone can make our offerings and gifts perfect. The Bible has accu-\nmulated and bound up together its treasures for this last generation.\nAll the great events and solemn transactions of Old Testament his-\ntory have been, and are, repeating themselves in the church in these\nlast days. There is Moses still speaking, teaching self-renunciation\nby wishing himself blotted from the Book of Life for his fellow\n302\nBible Prophets Wrote for Our Time 303\nmen, that they might be saved. David is leading the intercession\nof the church for the salvation of souls to the ends of the earth.\nThe prophets are still testifying of the sufferings of Christ and the\nglory that should follow. There the whole accumulated truths are\npresented in force to us that we may profit by their teachings. We\nare under the influence of the whole. What manner of persons ought\nwe to be to whom all this rich light of inheritance has been given.\nConcentrating all the influence of the past with new and increased\nlight of the present, accrued power is given to all who will follow\nthe light. Their faith will increase, and be brought into exercise at\nthe present time, awakening an energy and an intensely increased\nearnestness, and through dependence upon God for His power to\nreplenish the world and send the light of the Sun of Righteousness\nto the ends of the earth.\nGod has enriched the world in these last days proportionately\nwith the increase of ungodliness, if His people will only lay hold of\nHis priceless gift and bind up their every interest with Him. There\nshould be no cherished idols, and we need not dread what will come,\nbut commit the keeping of our souls to God, as unto our faithful\nCreator. He will keep that which is committed to His trust.\u2014Letter\n74a, 1897.\nChapter 49\u2014Can All Have the Gift of Prophecy?[340]\nFrom time to time reports come to me concerning statements\nthat Sister White is said to have made but which are entirely new to\nme, and which cannot fail to mislead the people as to my real views\nand teaching. A sister, in a letter to her friends speaks with much\nenthusiasm of a statement by Brother Jones that Sister White has\nseen that the time has come when, if we hold the right relation to\nGod, all can have the gift of prophecy to the same extent as do those\nwho are now having visions.\nWhere is the authority for this statement? I must believe that the\nsister failed to understand Brother Jones, for I cannot think that he\nmade the statement. The writer continues: \u201cBrother Jones said last\nnight that is the case, not that God will speak to all for the benefit\nof every one else but to each for his own benefit, and this will fulfill\nthe prophecy of Joel.\u201d He stated that this is already being developed\nin numerous instances.\nHe spoke as if he thought none would hold such a leading posi-\ntion as Sister White had done and will still do. Referred to Moses\nas a parallel. He was a leader, but many others are referred to as\nprophesying, though their prophecies are not published. He (Brother\nJones) will not give permission to have the matter copied for general[341]\ncirculation, that has been read here from some sister....\nThese ideas in relation to prophesying, I do not hesitate to say,\nmight better never have been expressed. Such statements prepare\nthe way for a state of things that Satan will surely take advantage\nof to bring in spurious exercises. There is danger, not only that\nunbalanced minds will be led into fanaticism, but that designing\npersons will take advantage of this excitement to further their own\nselfish purposes.\nJesus has raised his voice in warning: \u201cBeware of false prophets,\nwhich come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are raven-\ning wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits\u201d (Matthew 7:15, 16).\n\u201cThus saith the Lord of hosts, hearken not unto the words of the\n304\nCan All Have the Gift of Prophecy? 305\nprophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak\na vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord\u201d\n(Jeremiah 23:16). \u201cIf any man shall say to you, Lo here is Christ, or\nlo, he is there, believe him not; for false Christs and false prophets\nshall arise, and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce, if it were\npossible, even the elect. But take ye heed; behold, I have foretold\nyou all things\u201d (Mark 13:21-23).\u2014Letter 6a, 1894.\nChapter 50\u2014Disparaging the Pioneers[342]\nIt is possible to relate that which has happened in connection with\nthe past experience of the people of God, and so relate it as to make\ntheir experience assume a ludicrous and objectionable appearance. It\nis not fair to take certain features of the work and set them apart from\nthe great whole. A mixture of truth and error may be presented in so\ndoing, which our enemies would handle greatly to the disadvantage\nof the truth and to the hindrance of the work and cause of God....\nLet none of our brethren imagine that they are doing God\u2019s\nservice in presenting the deficiencies of men who have done good,\ngrand, acceptable work in laboring to unfold the message of mercy to\nfallen men, for the salvation of perishing souls. Suppose that these\nbrethren have weak traits of character which they have inherited\nfrom their deficient ancestors, shall these deficiencies be hunted up\nand made prominent?\nShall men whom God has chosen to carry out the reformation\nagainst the papacy and idolatry be presented in an objectionable\nlight? The banner of the ruler of the synagogue of Satan was lifted\nhigh, and error apparently marched in triumph, and the reformers\nthrough the grace given them of God, waged a successful warfare\nagainst the host of darkness. Events in the history of the reformers[343]\nhave been presented before me. I know that the Lord Jesus and His\nangels have with intense interest watched the battle against the power\nof Satan, who combined his hosts with evil men for the purpose of\nextinguishing the divine light, the fire of God\u2019s kingdom. They\nsuffered for Christ\u2019s sake scorn, derision, and the hatred of men who\nknew not God. They were maligned and persecuted even unto death,\nbecause they would not renounce their faith. If anyone presumes\nto take these men in hand, and to lay before the world their errors\nand mistakes, let him remember that he is dealing with Christ in the\nperson of His saints....\nA Rebuke to an Adventist Author \u2014You have made public\nthe errors and defects of the people of God, and in so doing have\n306\nDisparaging the Pioneers 307\ndishonored God and Jesus Christ. I would not for my right arm have\ngiven to the world that which you have written. You have not been\nconscious of what would be the influence of your work....\nThe Lord did not call upon you to present these things to the\npublic as a correct history of our people. Your work will make it\nnecessary for us to put forth labor to show why these brethren took\nthe extreme position that they did, and call up the circumstances that\nvindicate those upon whom your articles have laid suspicion and\nreproach.\nYou Have Given a Distorted View\u2014You were not in the early\nexperience of the people of whom you have written, and who have\nbeen laid to rest from their labors. You have given but a partial view;\nfor you have not presented the fact that the power of God worked in\nconnection with their labors, even though they made some mistakes.\nYou have made prominent before the world the errors of the brethren,\nbut have not represented the fact that God worked to correct those\nerrors, and to set the objectionable matters right. Opposers will be\nglad to multiply the matter which has been furnished to their hand\nby our people. You have arrayed the errors of the early apostles, the\nerrors of those who were precious in the eyes of the Lord in the days [344]\nof Christ.\nIn presenting the extreme positions that have been taken by the\nmessengers of God, do you think that confidence will be inspired\nin the work of God for this time? Let God by inspiration trace the\nerrors of His people for their instruction and admonition; but let\nnot finite lips or pens dwell upon those features of the experience\nof God\u2019s people that will have a tendency to confuse and cloud the\nmind. Let no one call attention to the errors of those whose general\nwork has been accepted of God. The articles you have presented are\nnot of a character to leave a true and fair impression upon the minds\nof those who read them concerning our work and our workers....\nGod\u2019s children are very precious in His sight, and those who by\npen or voice weaken the influence of even the least of those who\nbelieve in Jesus Christ, are registered in heaven as injurers of the\nLord Himself. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of\nthese my brethren, ye have done it unto me.\u201d We need to remember\nthat we should guard carefully our thoughts, our feelings, our words,\nour actions, lest we wound and bruise the Saviour in the person of\n308 Selected Messages Book 3\nHis saints; for He has told us plainly that He identifies Himself with\nsuffering humanity. Not one of God\u2019s faithful ones will receive the\nhonor of a crown of life in the kingdom of glory, who has not passed\nthrough severe conflicts and trials. Every one who wins in running\nthe race for the immortal crown, will have striven lawfully.\nTurn Not Weapons on Christ\u2019s Soldiers \u2014We are to direct\nthe weapons of our warfare against our foes, but never to turn them\ntoward those who are under marching orders from the King of Kings,\nwho are fighting manfully the battles of the Lord of lords. Let no one\naim at a soldier whom God recognizes, whom God has sent forth to\nbear a special message to the world and to do a special work.\nThe soldiers of Christ may not always reveal perfection in their\nstep, but their mistakes should call out from their fellow comrades[345]\nnot words that will weaken, but words that will strengthen, and will\nhelp them recover their lost ground. They should not turn the glory\nof God into dishonor, and give an advantage to the bitterest foes of\ntheir King.\nLet not fellow soldiers be severe, unreasonable judges of their\ncomrades, and make the most of every defect. Let them not manifest\nsatanic attributes in becoming accusers of the brethren. We shall find\nourselves misrepresented and falsified by the world, while we are\nmaintaining the truth and vindicating God\u2019s downtrodden law; but\nlet no one dishonor the cause of God by making public some mistake\nthat the soldiers of Christ may make, when that mistake is seen and\ncorrected by [the] ones who have taken some false position....\nGod will charge those who unwisely expose the mistakes of their\nbrethren with sin of far greater magnitude than He will charge the one\nwho makes a misstep. Criticism and condemnation of the brethren\nare counted as criticism and condemnation of Christ.\u2014Letter 48,\n1894.\nIncreased Light Imposes Increased Responsibility\nIn this day we have been privileged to have increased light and\nlarge opportunities, and we are held responsible for the improvement\nof light. This will be manifested by increased piety and devotion.\nOur loyalty to God should be proportionate to the light which shines\nupon us in this age.\nDisparaging the Pioneers 309\nBut the fact that we have increased light does not justify us in\ndissecting and judging the character of men whom God raised up\nin former times to do a certain work and to penetrate the moral\ndarkness of the world.\nIn the past the servants of God wrestled with principalities and\npowers, and with the rulers of the darkness of this world, and with\nspiritual wickedness in high places, the same as we, who bear aloft\nthe banner of truth, do today. These men were God\u2019s noblemen,\nHis living agencies, through whom He wrought in a wonderful [346]\nmanner. They were depositaries of divine truth to the extent that\nthe Lord saw fit to reveal the truth that the world could bear to hear.\nThey proclaimed the truth at a time when false, corrupt religion was\nmagnifying itself in the world.\nNo Occasion to Depreciate Character or Excuse Sin\u2014I could\nwish that the curtain could be rolled back, and that those who have\nnot spiritual eyesight might see these men as they appear in the sight\nof God; for now they see them as trees walking. They would not\nthen put their human construction upon the experience and works\nof the men who parted the darkness from the track and prepared the\nway for future generations.\nLiving down in our own generation, we may pronounce judgment\nupon the men whom God raised up to do a special work, according\nto the light given to them in their day. Though they may have\nbeen overcome with temptation, they repented of their sins; and no\nopportunity is left for us to depreciate their characters or to excuse\nsin. Their history is a beacon of warning to us, and points out a safe\npath for our feet if we will but shun their mistakes. These noble men\nsought the mercy seat and humbled their souls before God.\nLet not our voices or pens show that we are disregarding the\nsolemn injunctions of the Lord. Let no one depreciate those who\nhave been chosen of God, who have fought manfully the battles of\nthe Lord, who have woven heart and soul and life into the cause and\nwork of God, who have died in faith, and who are partakers of the\ngreat salvation purchased for us through our precious sin-bearing,\nsin-pardoning Saviour.\nSpeak Not of Mistakes of Living or Dead\u2014God has inspired\nno man to reproduce their mistakes, and to present their errors to\na world that is lying in wickedness, and to a church composed of\n310 Selected Messages Book 3\nmany who are weak in faith. The Lord has not laid the burden upon\nmen to revive the mistakes and errors of the living or the dead. He\nwould have His laborers present the truth for this time. Speak not\nof the errors of your brethren who are living, and be silent as to the[347]\nmistakes of the dead.\nLet their mistakes and errors remain where God has put them\u2014\ncast into the depths of the sea. The less that is said by those who\nprofess to believe present truth, in regard to the past mistakes and\nerrors of the servants of God, the better it will be for their own\nsouls, and for the souls of those whom Christ has purchased with\nHis own blood. Let every voice proclaim the words of the first and\nthe last, the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. John\nheard a voice saying, \u201cBlessed are the dead which die in the Lord\nfrom henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their\nlabours; and their works do follow them\u201d (Revelation 14:13).\u2014The\nReview and Herald, November 30, 1897. [This counsel was written\nto a worker who had published two articles in The Review and\nHerald, April 3 and 10, 1894 under the title \u201cDanger of Adopting\nExtreme Views.\u201d\u2014Compilers.]\nChapter 51\u2014Attacks on Ellen White and Her Work [348]\nShould We Keep Silent?\nWhen man assails his fellow men, and presents in a ridiculous\nlight those whom God has appointed to do work for him, we would\nnot be doing justice to the accusers, or to those who are misled by\ntheir accusations should we keep silent, leaving the people to think\nthat their brethren and sisters, in whom they have had confidence,\nare no longer worthy of their love and fellowship. This work, arising\nin our very midst, and resembling the work of Korah, Dathan, and\nAbiram, is an offence to God, and should be met. And on every point\nthe accusers [Addressed to certain accusers in Australia who had\nhad special evidence of Ellen White\u2019s work.\u2014Compilers.] should\nbe called upon to bring their proof. Every charge should be carefully\ninvestigated; it should not be left in any uncertain way, the people\nshould not be left to think that it may be or it may not be. The\naccusers should do all in their power to lift every sign of reproach\nthat cannot be substantiated.\nLeave Not the People to Believe a Lie\u2014This should be done in\nthe case of every church. And when there is a servant of God, whom\nHe has appointed to do a certain work, and who for half a century\nhas been an accepted worker, laboring for the people of our faith, [349]\nand before God\u2019s workers as one whom the Lord has appointed;\nwhen for some reason one of the brethren falls under temptation, and\nbecause of the messages of warning given him becomes offended,\nas did the disciples of Christ, and walks no more with Christ; when\nhe begins to work against the truth, and make his disaffection public,\ndeclaring things untrue which are true, these things must be met. The\npeople must not be left to believe a lie. They must be undeceived.\nThe filthy garments with which the servant of God has been clothed\nmust be removed.\nIf those who have done this work take shelter in the statement\nthat they are led by the Holy Spirit, it is as Satan clothing himself\n311\n312 Selected Messages Book 3\nwith the heavenly garments of purity, while still working out his own\nattributes.\u2014Letter 98, 1897, pp. 5, 9.\nSo-called Discrepancies and Contradictions in the Testi-\nmonies\u2014Those who have chosen to follow their own way, have\nbegun to publish the discrepancies and contradictions, so-called, that\nthey claim to find in connection with the Testimonies; and they are\nmisstating some matters by using their own words instead of the\nwords found in my writings. These charges will have to be met, that\ntruth may take the place of falsehood.\u2014Letter 162, 1906.\nTo Meet and Correct Falsehoods\nI have no controversy with V . My life mission is before the\nworld. It is not my work. It is the Lord\u2019s work. I take no credit to\nmyself; for the Lord will deliver me from the strife of tongues. \u201cBy\ntheir fruits ye shall know them.\u201d\nWe shall now have to meet and correct the falsehoods that have\ngone forth from V and his wife, in order that our brethren may know\nfrom whence they come. I must know what he charges against them.\nTo bring before the public a tirade against a woman is not a result\nof the working of the Holy Spirit, but an inspiration of the spirit of[350]\nthe enemy, to which we shall give no place. Shall we leave souls\nto drink in temptation because of misrepresentation? No, never; I\nwould be an unfaithful steward did I do this. There now needs to\nbe a true statement placed before the people; and then my work is\ndone. I enter into no arguments, but I cannot allow the work of God,\nwhich has borne fruit that has been before the people during almost\nmy whole lifetime, to be brushed away as a cobweb, by whom? A\nhuman being, subject to temptation, whom Satan is now sifting as\nwheat.\u2014Letter 65, 1897.\nThe Church Paper to Speak\n(A Message to the Editor in 1883.)\nI have been waiting to see what you would do in putting some-\nthing in the paper to vindicate the right. You have had ample time....\nWhy do you not do justice by my husband\u2019s name and reputation,\nand why do you keep entirely silent and let the dragon roar?\nAttacks on Ellen White and Her Work 313\nFor myself I care not, my peace is not disturbed, but I do care\nfor the watchmen whom God has placed on the walls of Zion who\nought to give the trumpet a certain sound. You certainly ought to do\nsomething for your own sake, for Christ\u2019s sake, for the truth\u2019s sake.\nWhy do you not let the right appear? Why do you remain as silent\nas the dead? Is this the way you defend the truth? ...\nMrs. White the Text of Every Opposer\u2014Truth will triumph.\nI expect these raids will be made against me till Christ comes. There\nis not an opposer of our faith but that makes Mrs. White his text.\nThey begin to oppose the truth and then make a raid on me. What\nhave I done? If evil, then let them bear witness of the evil....\nWell, Long\u2019s and also Green\u2019s books [The products of a break-\naway, apostate movement.] came out, these most weak and con-\ntemptible productions. I waited for you and others to speak of these, [351]\nas you stood in the responsible position you did as watchmen on the\nwalls of Zion and should warn the people....\nWhy All This Zeal Against Me? \u2014Things move rapidly, and\nthere are strange and startling developments made in quick succes-\nsion. We are nearing the end. Why, I ask, is all this zeal against me?\nI have attended to my business given me of God. I have injured no\none. I have spoken to the erring the words God has given me. Of\ncourse, I could not compel them to hear. Those who had the benefit\nof Christ\u2019s labors were just as enraged against Him as the enemies\nare against me.\nI have only done my duty. I have spoken because compelled to\nspeak. They have not rejected me, but Him who sent me. He has\ngiven me my work....\nI am watched, every word I write is criticised, every move I make\nis commented upon....\nI leave my work and its results until we gather about the great\nwhite throne. Do you see the Spirit of Christ in this watching, in\nthese suspicions, in these conjectures, these suppositions? What\nright have they to suppose, to conjecture, to misinterpret my words?\nto misstate me as they do?\nThere is a class that love just this kind of food. They are scav-\nengers not looking candidly to see what good my writings and my\ntestimonies have done, but like Satan, the accuser of the brethren,\nsee what evil they can find, what mischief they can work, what word\n314 Selected Messages Book 3\nthey can twist, and put their wicked construction upon it, to make a\nfalse prophet....\nI see the satanic spirit more plainly developed than has been\nmanifested the last forty years.\u2014Letter 3, 1883.\nCommunicated Like Leaven \u2014If Satan can excite criticism\namong any of the Lord\u2019s professed people, then it is communicated\nlike leaven from one to another. Give the spirit of criticism no\nquarter, for it is Satan\u2019s science. Accept it, and envy, jealousy, and\nevil surmisings of one another follow.\nPress together, is the command I hear from the Captain of our[352]\nsalvation. Press together. Where there is unity, there is strength.\nAll who are on the Lord\u2019s side will press together. There is need of\nperfect unity and love among believers in the truth, and anything\nthat leads to dissension is of the devil. The Lord designs that His\npeople shall be one with Him as the branches are one with the vine.\nThen they will be one with each other.\u2014Letter 6, 1899.\nA Long List of False Statements Expected\u2014I expect now that\na long list of false statements will be presented to the world, and\nthat lie upon lie, misstatement upon misstatement, which Satan has\noriginated in the minds of individuals, will by some be accepted as\ntruth. But I leave my case in the hands of God, and those who know\nmy life practice will not receive the lies that are spoken.\u2014Letter 22,\n1906.\nChapter 52\u2014Sinlessness and Salvation [353]\nThe Claim to Sinlessness\n[Excerpt from a sermon preached by Ellen G. White at Santa Rosa,\nCalifornia, March 7, 1885.]\nSays John, in speaking of the deceiver that doeth great wonders:\nHe shall make an image to the beast, and shall cause all to receive\nhis mark. Will you please to consider this matter? Search the\nscriptures, and see. There is a wonder-working power to appear:\nand it will be when men are claiming sanctification, and holiness,\nlifting themselves up higher and higher and boasting of themselves.\nLook at Moses and the prophets; look at Daniel and Joseph and\nElijah. Look at these men, and find me one sentence where they\never claimed to be sinless. The very soul that is in close relation to\nChrist, beholding His purity and excellency, will fall before Him\nwith shamefacedness.\nDaniel was a man to whom God had given great skill and learn-\ning, and when he fasted the angel came to him and said, \u201cThou art\ngreatly beloved.\u201d And he fell prostrate before the angel. He did\nnot say, \u201cLord, I have been very faithful to You and I have done\neverything to honor You and defend Your word and name. Lord, You\nknow how faithful I was at the king\u2019s table, and how I maintained [354]\nmy integrity when they cast me into the den of lions.\u201d Was that the\nway Daniel prayed to God?\nNo; he prayed and confessed his sins, and said, Hear O Lord,\nand deliver; we have departed from Thy Word and have sinned. And\nwhen he saw the angel, he said, My comeliness was turned into\ncorruption. He could not look upon the angel\u2019s face, and he had no\nstrength; it was all gone. So the angel came to him and set him upon\nhis knees. He could not behold him then. And then the angel came\nto him with the appearance of a man. Then he could bear the sight.\nOnly Those Far From Christ Claim Sinlessness \u2014Why is it\nthat so many claim to be holy and sinless?

From\nthe time that I was 14 years old, if I knew what the will of God was,\nI was willing to do it. You never have heard me say I am sinless.\nThose that get sight of the loveliness and exalted character of Jesus\nChrist, who was holy and lifted up and His train fills the temple, will\nnever say it.

It was thought that my eyesight was gone, but when I again\nbecame accustomed to the things of this world I could see again. This\nis why I tell you never to boast, saying, \u201cI am holy, I am sanctified,\u201d\nfor it is the surest evidence that you know not the Scripture or the\npower of God.

As we have clearer\nviews of Christ\u2019s spotlessness and infinite purity, we shall feel as\ndid Daniel, when he beheld the glory of the Lord, and said, \u201cMy\ncomeliness was turned in me into corruption.\u201d\nWe cannot say, \u201cI am sinless,\u201d till this vile body is changed and\nfashioned like unto His glorious body.

If God\u2019s people will not study these\nmessages that are sent to them from time to time, they are guilty of\nrejecting light. Line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little\nand there a little, God is sending instruction to His people. Heed the\ninstruction; follow the light. The Lord has a controversy with His\npeople because in the past they have not heeded His instruction and\nfollowed His guidance.\nI have been reading V olume Six of theTestimonies, and I find in\nthis little book instruction that will help us to meet many perplexing\nquestions. How many have read the article \u201cEvangelistic Work\u201d\nin this volume?

By far too small a portion of our people are in possession\nof these books.\u2014Letter 292, 1907.\nPersonal Study Would Answer Questions\nWe receive many letters from our brethren and sisters, asking\nfor advice on a great variety of subjects. If they would study the\n319\n320 Selected Messages Book 3\npublished Testimonies for themselves, they would find the enlight-\nenment they need. Let us urge our people to study these books, and\ncirculate them. Let their teachings strengthen our faith.\nLet us study more diligently the Word of God. The Bible is\nso plain and clear that all who will may understand. Let us thank\nthe Lord for His precious Word, and for the messages of His Spirit\nthat give so much light. I am instructed that the more we study the\nOld and New Testaments, the more we shall have impressed on our\nmind the fact that each sustains a very close relation to the other,\nand the more evidence we shall receive of their divine inspiration.\nWe shall see clearly that they have but one Author. The study of\nthese precious volumes will teach us how to form characters that\nwill reveal the attributes of Christ.\u2014Manuscript 81, 1908.\nRead the Testimonies for Yourselves\nI am at times made very sad as I think of the use made of the\nTestimonies. Men and women report everything that strikes them or\nthat they hear as a testimony from Sister White, when Sister White\nnever heard of such a thing....\nThe only safety for any of us is to plant our feet upon the Word\nof God and study the Scriptures, making God\u2019s Word our constant\nmeditation. Tell the people to take no man\u2019s word regarding the\nTestimonies, but to read them and study them for themselves, and\nthen they will know that they are in harmony with the truth. The\nWord of God is the truth.\u2014Letter 132, 1900.\nTestimonies Our Protection[360]\nI urged our brethren to become acquainted with the teachings\nthat are in the Testimonies. God has given us light that we cannot\ndisregard or treat with indifference or contempt. He has let light\nshine upon us in reproofs, in warnings, that we may, if we will, take\nhold upon it and escape the dangers that beset our pathway. When\ntemptations arise, we may be guarded and we may discern them\nbecause the Lord has pointed them out to us, that we shall not be\ndeceived.\u2014Manuscript 23, 1889.\nStudy the Testimonies 321\nThe humility that bears fruit, filling the soul with a sense of the\nlove of God, will speak for the one who has cherished it, in the great\nday when men will be rewarded according as their works have been.\nHappy will be the one of whom it can be said, \u201cThe Spirit of God\nnever stirred this man\u2019s soul in vain. He went forward and upward\nfrom strength to strength. Self was not woven into his life.\n\u201cEach message of correction, warning, and counsel he received\nas a blessing from God. Thus the way was prepared for him to\nreceive still greater blessings, because God did not speak to him in\nvain. Each step upward on the ladder of progress prepared him to\nclimb still higher. From the top of the ladder the bright beams of\nGod\u2019s glory shone upon him. He did not think of resting, but sought\nconstantly to attain the wisdom and righteousness of Christ. Ever he\npressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in\nChrist Jesus.\u201d\nThis experience every one who is saved must have. In the day\nof judgment, the course of the man who has retained the frailty and\nimperfection of humanity will not be vindicated. For him there will\nbe no place in heaven.

It was so in Reformation times and\nhas been so in the days of the remnant church. The section \u201cFa-\nnaticism and Deceptive Teachings\u201d inSelected Messages, book 2,\ncontains an abundance of timely warnings on problems of this na-\nture. Two matters, however, that were not particularly emphasized\nin that section are false speaking in tongues, and demon possession\nand the casting out of demons.\nIn 1908, Mr. And Mrs. Ralph Mackin called on Ellen White.\nAs she gave counsel then and in the days that followed, these two\nsubjects became quite prominent. The report of the interview and\nthe letters of counsel written after Ellen White was given instruction\non these matters in vision were published in the Review and Herald,\nAugust 10, 17, and 24, 1972. Major portions are included here to\nmake the record available in book form.\nWhite Trustees.\n324\nChapter 54\u2014The Mackin Case [363]\nOn Thursday morning, November 12, 1908, Ellen White was at\nher Elmshaven home busy in her writing room. Here her son, W. C.\nWhite, found her and told her there were two persons in the living\nroom below who wished to talk with her. Joining him, she went\ndownstairs to meet Ralph Mackin and his wife. She found a well-\ndressed and seemingly very sincere couple in their middle thirties.\nMrs. White soon learned that her visitors were earnest students of\nthe Bible and the Testimonies and had come to California from Ohio\nfor the express purpose of learning whether their unusual experience\nof a few months past was endorsed by the Lord.\nThe conversation with the Mackins was taken down stenograph-\nically at the time of the interview by Clarence C. Crisler, Ellen G.\nWhite\u2019s leading secretary.\nCompilers.\nReport of the Interview\nBrother and Sister Mackin stated that they had felt impressed\nby the Holy Spirit to make a special trip West in order to interview\nSister White regarding some unusual experiences through which\nthey had been passing. During the week of prayer nearly three years\nbefore they had united with their little church at Findlay, Ohio, in a [364]\nspecial season of seeking God for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.\nRalph Mackin: In the week of prayer reading for that year, every\narticle was directed to the people to seek for the Holy Spirit. We set\naside in our little church three days for fasting and prayer, and we\nfasted and prayed for three days\u2014that is, not constantly together, but\nwe felt the need of a deeper work and felt the necessity of coming\ninto possession of more of the Spirit of God. We began to study\nfrom that time on the work of the Holy Spirit, from the Bible and\nthe Testimonies, And especially from volume 8 and volume 7, and\nEarly Writings, and also the little book made up of a collection of\n325\n326 Selected Messages Book 3\nleaflets and entitled, Special Testimonies To Ministers and Workers.\nThis we found to be a most precious volume to us. It shows how in\ntimes past men who had been called of God were treated, et cetera.\nThe message that the Lord gave me particularly was to follow\nthe life of the apostles....\nSeveral scriptures were then read, including Luke 24 to the close\nof the chapter, ending with these words:\n\u201cAnd they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great\njoy: and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.\nAmen.\u201d\nNow, I teach that this blessing is the blessing of sanctification\nthat they received, that He bestowed upon them; and when we seek\nGod\u2014if we are a sinner, until we are converted; if we are converted,\nthen we put up the prayer for the power of sanctification to live clean,\nwholesome lives. Not that it is the work of an instant; not \u201conce\nsanctified, always sanctified\u201d; that is not true. But we should so\nfirmly and eagerly put up our petition that we receive the blessing. It\nhas the same physiological effect on us\u2014oh, we just want to praise\nJesus, and it makes us so loving and gentle and kind. But we notice\nthat the disciples were not ready yet to go out with that blessing to\ndo work for the Master. He told them to tarry until they were endued\nwith power from on high. Then we put up our petition and hold right[365]\non by faith, and that which encouraged us to do this was the chapter\nentitled \u201cthe shaking time\u201d in Early Writings\u2014we hung right on by\nfaith, until great drops of sweat stood on our brow. Believing that\nthe same power that the disciples had was for us today, we were\nencouraged to hold on.\nExperience Recorded in Acts 2 Repeated \u2014When that\npromised blessing came on us, as we put up our petitions to God,\nwe had the same experience as recorded here in Acts 2 in regard to\nthe apostles. When that promised power came upon us we spake in\nother tongues as the Spirit gave us utterance.\nIn Toledo, when we were bearing our message on the street,\na man who was a Polish Catholic stood on the street when Mrs.\nMackin was speaking; and as the Spirit of God came upon her, and\nspoke to them through her in another language that she could not\nunderstand, this Polish gentleman exclaimed, \u201cI know what that lady\nMackin Case 327\nis speaking. She is speaking in my own tongue of a calamity which\nis soon to be visited on this city.\u201d\nAlleged Foreign Tongue\u2014In other instances, when one comes\ninto this blessing of speaking with tongues, the Lord may give me\nthe same tongue, and we may hold a conversation in the language\nthat the Spirit of God may have given us utterance in. Even three or\nfour may take part in the conversation, and yet it is a foreign tongue\nto them, and one waits on the other until the other is through; and it\nis all in order. This is the experience we received, according to the\npromised blessing....\nIf we are in a delusion, we are honestly there. But if this is from\nthe Spirit of God, we want to follow it....\nThis Spirit tells us to search the Word: tells us to be earnest; and\ntells us to be careful about our diet; tells us exactly what you have\nsaid.\nGift of Prophecy Claimed\u2014Now, my wife, the Spirit operates\nthrough her, and we believe that this is the gift of prophecy that is to\nbe poured out onto all flesh. This Spirit leads us into kindness and [366]\npurity of life, and we can\u2019t understand it\u2014why\u2014only that as the\nWord of God has said, that these experiences come as the result of\nreceiving the blessing of the Spirit of God\nThe Camp Meeting Experience \u2014Before we went onto the\ncampground\u2014we did not go until Friday\u2014my wife and two other\nladies (my mother, and another lady, Sister Edwards, a sister-in-\nlaw to the president of the conference)\u2014before we went upon the\ncampground this last year, they three were seeking the Lord. I had\ngone downtown on an errand; and the Spirit of God told her (Mrs.\nMackin) to go on the campground, and there sing; and there He\nwould tell her what to sing.\nAnd she wept just like a child, and just seemed like she could\nnot stand it because that the Lord showed her the condition of our\npeople\u2014soon the plagues would fall, and they were unready. There\nwas no meeting in progress, and the Spirit of the Lord came upon\nher as she went onto the campground, and (turning to Mrs. Mackin)\nyou may tell her what words you sang.\nMrs. Mackin: The Lord put this burden upon me. I could not\nstand it. I wanted to tell it so bad, and sing that song so bad. And I\ncould not get rid of it till I would do it. \u201cOh, pray,\u201d says I to Sister\n328 Selected Messages Book 3\nEdwards; and so I stood on the campground, and I sang just what the\nLord gave me. The Lord\u2014this is what I sang:\u2014\u201cHe is coming; He\nis coming; Get ready; Get ready.\u201d And then that statement inEarly\nWritings\u2014\n\u201cHow many I saw coming up to the falling of the plagues without\na shelter. Receive ye the Holy Ghost.\u201d These are the words I sang.\nI sang them over and over again. They could hear it all over the\ncampground, and they came together; but before that, the Lord\nshowed me how they would wring their hands as the plagues were\nfalling. The Lord can show anything in just a moment, better than\nHe could tell it to us. And so He showed me how they would wring\ntheir hands, and that put on me a greater burden than ever. Well, that[367]\nis when they arrested us....\nIt is when the singing is extemporaneous\u2014dictated by the\nSpirit\u2014that it is the most wonderful.\nIf you have any light for us ...\nEllen G. White: I do not know that I have anything special that I\ncould say. There will be things that will transpire at the very close\nof this earth\u2019s history, it has been presented to me, similar to some\nof the things that you have represented; but I cannot say anything on\nthese points now.\nR. Mackin : Is there any question, Brother White, or anything\nnow?\nW. C. White : I do not know as there is anything more than to\npray that the Lord will give Mother some word, and then take time\nfor matters to develop. It is better, in presenting anything to her, to\npresent the subject briefly and clearly, and then perhaps have another\ninterview with her later on.\nR. Mackin: We are fasting and praying. If we are in a delusion,\nwe want to know it, just as much as if we were in the right.\nMrs. Mackin : Our brethren certainly think that we are in a\ndelusion.\nEllen G. White: What place was this that you speak of, where\nthis singing was?\nR. Mackin: Mansfield, Ohio, at the camp meeting.\nEllen G. White: Our people\u2014Sabbathkeeping people?\nR. Mackin: Yes, our own people.\nMackin Case 329\nW. C. White : Was that verse that Mrs. Mackin sang last night\nextemporaneous or a known hymn? [At the prayer meeting in the\nsanitarium chapel Brother Mackin had given his testimony in the\npraise service and was followed by Mrs. Mackin, who sang.]\nMrs. R. Mackin: Oh, that was one of our published hymns. It is\nin the new Christ in Song.\nR. Mackin: From hearing that you could scarcely gain an idea of\nher singing when the words are given to her by the Holy Spirit. The [368]\nmost wonderful thing is when she sings \u201cGlory!\u201d She says when she\nsings it she seems to be in the presence of Jesus, with the angels.\nShe repeats the word \u201cGlory!\u201d over and over again. She has been\ntested with the piano, and musicians say it is a freak\u2014the lowness\nand the highness with which she does it. She cannot do it only as\nshe prays in the Spirit and special power comes upon her.\nMrs. Mackin: We don\u2019t have this power, only as we seek Jesus.\nCasting out demons\u2014R. Mackin: The Lord has given us power,\nSister White, to cast out demons. Many people are possessed with\ndemons. I remember a statement you wrote a few years ago that\nmany were possessed with demons as verily as they were in the days\nof Christ. When we are in a meeting, and these demons are in a\nmeeting, they may cause people to do queer things. I noticed in\nthe Bible when Jesus was in the temple that demons at once came\nout. \u201cHold thy peace, and come out of him.\u201d The Lord instructs\nus to lay the people down, lest the demons throw them when they\ncome out. We found in the beginning that when we begin to rebuke\nthese demons they oftentimes close the eyes of these people, and\nwill sometimes cause them to bark like a dog, and stick out their\ntongue; but as we continue to rebuke them, why, the eyes open and\nthey become calm, and the demons -----\nNow it is through the gift of the Spirit that the Lord tells us when\nthe demons are gone, that they are all gone. One lady in particular\nhad six demons, and she said she just felt them when they came\nout\u2014it just seemed to pull her in every part of the body.\nBut our brethren say that they can\u2019t be in the last days; but\nwe find that it coincides with just what the Saviour said in the last\nchapter of Mark, in that great commission: \u201cAnd these signs shall\nfollow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they\nshall speak with new tongues;\u201d and so on.\n330 Selected Messages Book 3\nMrs. Mackin: We did not get this all at once, either.\nR. Mackin: Read the remaining verses of Mark: \u201cAnd these signs[369]\nshall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out devils;\nthey shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and\nif they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay\nhands on the sick, and they shall recover. So then after the Lord had\nspoken unto them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the\nright hand of God. And they went forth, and preached every where,\nthe Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs\nfollowing. Amen.\u201d Our experience, so far as we are able to discern,\ncorroborates with the Bible. Here is something that I would like to\nread [Here Brother Mackin read extracts, including the following,\nfrom an article in the Review and Herald, by Sister White, published\nin the issue for April 11, 1899, and entitled, \u201cThe Newcastle Camp\nMeeting\u201d]:\n\u201cDuring the night of the first Sabbath of the Newcastle meeting,\nI seemed to be in meeting, presenting the necessity and importance\nof our receiving the Spirit. This was the burden of my labor\u2014the\nopening of our hearts to the Holy Spirit.\u201d\n[No record was made by the stenographer as to the exact place\nwhere Brother Mackin began reading this article, and where he\nceased reading; but at least a considerable portion was read.]\nWhat Is the Evidence? \u2014R. Mackin : In connection with the\nreceiving of power from on high there is a question, it seems to me,\njust as pertinent now as in the days of the apostles\u2014What is the\nevidence? If we receive it, will it not have the same physiological\neffect on us as it did back there? It can be expected that we shall\nspeak as the Spirit gives us utterance.\nEllen G. White : In the future we shall have special tokens of\nthe influence of the Spirit of God\u2014especially at times when our\nenemies are the strongest against us. The time will come when we\nshall see some strange things; but just in what way\u2014whether similar\nto some of the experiences of the disciples after they received the\nHoly Spirit following the ascension of Christ\u2014I cannot say. [370]\nR. Mackin: We will continually pray to the Lord about this, and\nask Him to give you light in regard to it. So I leave you our address,\nand if you have anything for us after this, we shall be glad to receive\nit.\nMackin Case 331\nW. C. White: You will probably spend a few days here, will you\nnot?\nR. Mackin: If the Holy Spirit tells us that our work is done now,\nwe will go; if He tells us to tarry, we will tarry. It leads us. As I\nhave presented this message to different congregations the Spirit of\nGod has witnessed to it, and many weep, and they say, \u201cOh, we need\npower, we need help, and this is the power promised, and let us seek\nGod.\u201d\nMrs. Mackin: The real test is love\u20141 Corinthians 13.\nR. Mackin: Satan wants to hinder this work. We are sealed by\nthe Holy Spirit of promise. I present it from Early Writings when\nthe angels are about to loose the four winds, Jesus gazes in pity\non the remnant, and with uplifted hands cries, \u201cMy blood, father,\nMy blood, My blood, My blood!\u201d He repeats it four times; for His\npeople are still unsealed. He commissions an angel to fly swiftly to\nthe four angels holding the four winds, with the message, \u201cHold!\nHold! Hold! Hold! until the servants of God are sealed in their\nforeheads.\u201d And as I bring these things before the congregation it is\nthe most earnest and devoted ones that it seems to affect, mostly.\nEllen White Recounts Early Experiences\u2014Sister White then\nbegan talking, and continued for about half an hour. She told incident\nafter incident connected with her early labors shortly after the passing\nof the time in 1844. Her experiences with unusual forms of error in\nthose days in later years led her to be fearful of anything savoring of\na spirit of fanaticism.\nAs Sister White continued, she told of some who had strange\nexercisings of the body and of others who were governed largely by\ntheir own impressions. Some thought it wrong to work. Still others\nbelieved that the righteous dead had been raised to eternal life. A [371]\nfew sought to cultivate a spirit of humility by creeping on the floor,\nlike little children. Some would dance, and sing \u201cGlory, glory, glory,\nglory, glory, glory,\u201d over and over again. Sometimes a person would\njump up and down on the floor, with hands uplifted, praising God;\nand this would be kept up for as long as half an hour at a time.\nAmong those who took part in these extraordinary forms of\nfanaticism were some who had once been faithful, God-fearing\nbrethren and sisters. The strange exercisings of body and mind were\ncarried to such lengths that in a few places the officers of the law\n332 Selected Messages Book 3\nfelt compelled to restrain them by casting them into prison. The\ncause of God was thus brought into disrepute and it took years to\noutlive the influence that these exhibitions of fanaticism had upon\nthe general public.\nSister White further told of how she was called upon repeatedly\nto meet this fanaticism squarely and to rebuke it sternly in the name\nof the Lord. She emphasized the fact that we have a great work to do\nin the world, that our strength with the people lies in the power that\naccompanies a clear presentation of the Word of the living God. The\nlaw of Jehovah is to be exalted and made honorable; and the various\nfeatures of the third angel\u2019s message are to be plainly outlined before\nthe people that all may have an opportunity to hear the truth for this\ntime and to decide whether to obey God rather than man.\nIf we as a church were to give place to any form of fanaticism,\nthe minds of unbelievers would be diverted from the living Word to\nthe doings of mortal men, and there would appear more of the human\nthan the divine. Besides, many would be disgusted by that which\nto their minds seemed unnatural and bordering on the fanatical.\nThus the proclamation of the message for this time would be sadly\nhindered. The Holy Spirit works in a manner that commends itself\nto the good judgment of the people.\nAn Interesting Proposal \u2014in the midst of Sister White\u2019s ac-[372]\ncount of her early experiences with fanaticism Brother Mackin made\nthe following proposal:\nR. Mackin: If we would now have the spirit of prayer, and this\npower would come upon my wife, would you be able to discern\nwhether this was of the Lord or not?\nEllen G. White : I could not tell you anything about it. But I\nam telling you these experiences in order that you may know what\nwe have passed through. We tried in every way possible to rid the\nchurch of this evil. We declared in the name of the Lord God of\nIsrael that God does not work through his children in a way that\nbrings the truth into disrepute, and that unnecessarily creates deep-\nseated prejudice and bitter opposition. In our work we must take a\nstraightforward course and seek to reach the people where they are.\nRebuking Fanaticism\u2014R. Mackin : I remember reading very\nmuch of this in volume 1 of Testimonies for the Church \u2014your\nMackin Case 333\nexperience in rebuking fanaticism, and of the cause in the East when\nthey set the time, in 1855, I believe.\nEllen G. White : Some would dance up and down, singing,\n\u201cGlory, glory, glory, glory, glory.\u201d Sometimes I would sit still until\nthey got through, and then I would rise and say: This is not the way\nthe Lord works. He does not make impressions in this way. We must\ndirect the minds of the people to the Word as the foundation of our\nfaith.\nI was but a mere child at that time; and yet I had to bear my\ntestimony repeatedly against these strange workings. And ever since\nthat time I have sought to be very, very careful lest something of\nthis sort should come in again among our people. Any manifestation\nof fanaticism takes the mind away from the evidence of truth\u2014the\nWord itself.\nYou might take a consistent course, but those who would be in-\nfluenced by you might take a very inconsistent course, and as a result\nwe should very soon have our hands full of something that would [373]\nmake it almost impossible to give unbelievers the right impression\nof our message and work. We must go to the people with the solid\nWord of God; and when they receive that Word, the Holy Spirit may\ncome, but it always comes, as I have stated before, in a way that\ncommends itself to the judgment of the people. In our speaking,\nour singing, and in all our spiritual exercises, we are to reveal that\ncalmness and dignity and godly fear that actuates every true child of\nGod.\nDangers That Threaten Now \u2014There is constant danger of\nallowing something to come into our midst that we may regard as\nthe working of the Holy Spirit, but that in reality is the fruit of a\nspirit of fanaticism. So long as we allow the enemy of truth to lead\nus into a wrong way we cannot hope to reach the honest in heart with\nthe third angel\u2019s message. We are to be sanctified through obedience\nto the truth.\nI am afraid of anything that would have a tendency to turn the\nmind away from the solid evidences of the truth as revealed in God\u2019s\nWord. I am afraid of it; I am afraid of it. We must bring our minds\nwithin the bounds of reason, lest the enemy so come in as to set\neverything in a disorderly way. There are persons of an excitable\ntemperament who are easily led into fanaticism; and should we allow\n334 Selected Messages Book 3\nanything to come into our churches that would lead such persons\ninto error we would soon see these errors carried to extreme lengths;\nand then because of the course of these disorderly elements a stigma\nwould rest upon the whole body of Seventh-day Adventists.\nI have been studying how to get some of these early experiences\ninto print again, so that more of our people may be informed; for I\nhave long known that fanaticism will be manifest again, in different\nways. We are to strengthen our position by dwelling on the Word,\nand by avoiding all oddities and strange exercisings that some would\nbe very quick to catch up and practice. If we were to allow confusion\nto come into our ranks, we could not bind off our work as we should.[374]\nWe are trying to bind it off now, in every way possible.\nI thought I must relate these things to you.\nR. Mackin : Well, now, that which you have stated does not\ncorrespond with our experience. We have been very cautious in\nthis matter, and we find that the experience through which we have\npassed, and which we have endeavored to outline briefly to you this\nmorning, tallies exactly with the experience of God\u2019s servants of old\nas given in the Word.\nEllen G. White: During the years of Christ\u2019s ministry on earth\ngodly women assisted in the work that the Saviour and His disci-\nples were carrying forward. If those who were opposing this work\ncould have found anything out of the regular order in the conduct\nof these women, it would have closed the work at once. But while\nwomen were laboring with Christ and the apostles, the entire work\nwas conducted on so high a plane as to be above the shadow of\na suspicion. No occasion for any accusation could be found. The\nminds of all were directed to the Scriptures rather than to individuals.\nThe truth was proclaimed intelligently, and so plainly that all could\nunderstand.\nNow I am afraid to have anything of a fanatical nature brought\nin among our people. There are many, many who must be sanctified;\nbut they are to be sanctified through obedience to the message of\ntruth. I am writing on this subject today. In this message there is\na beautiful consistency that appeals to the judgment. We cannot\nallow excitable elements among us to display themselves in a way\nthat would destroy our influence with those whom we wish to reach\nwith the truth. It took us years to outlive the unfavorable impression\nMackin Case 335\nthat unbelievers gained of Adventists through their knowledge of the\nstrange and wicked workings of fanatical elements among us during\nthe early years of our existence as a separate people.\nBe Guarded\u2014R. Mackin: Well, now, this that you are giving us,\nwould this be considered testimony under the Spirit, or is it simply [375]\ncounsel\u2014of relating your experience?\nEllen G. White: I am giving you history.\nR. Mackin: But you do not say that that applies to our case now,\nuntil you have further light on it?\nEllen G. White: I could not say; but it appears to be along that\nline, as I am afraid of it. It appears to be along that line that I have\nmet again and again.\nW. C. White : It is now twelve o\u2019clock. Would you not like to\nrest before dinner?\nEllen G. White : Well, I could not let you go before I had said\nwhat I have said. I would say: Be guarded. Do not let anything\nappear that savors of fanaticism, and that others would act out. There\nare some who are eager to make a show, and they will act out\nwhatever you may do\u2014whether it be of the same tenor or not. I have\nbeen very careful not to stir up anything like strangeness among our\npeople.\nR. Mackin: But it is true that when the Holy Spirit does come,\nas is stated in your works, that many will turn against it, and declare\nthat it is fanaticism?\nEllen G. White : Of course they will; and for this reason we\nought to be very guarded. It is through the Word\u2014not feeling, not\nexcitement\u2014that we want to influence the people to obey the truth.\nOn the platform of God\u2019s Word we can stand with safety. The living\nWord is replete with evidence, and a wonderful power accompanies\nits proclamation in our world.\nR. Mackin: Well, we must not tire you.\nMrs. Mackin: Praise the Lord!\nEllen G. White (rising, and shaking hands): I want the Spirit\nof the Lord to be with you, and you, and me. We are to be just\nlike God\u2019s little children. The power of His grace must not be\nmisunderstood. We must have it in all meekness and humility and\nlowliness of mind, that God may make the impression Himself upon\nthe minds of the people. I hope the Lord will bless you and give\n336 Selected Messages Book 3\nyou a solid foundation, which foundation is the Word of the living\nGod.\u2014Manuscript 115, 1908.\nThe Lord Did Give Light[376]\nMr. and Mrs. Ralph Mackin,\nDear Brother and Sister,\nRecently, in visions of the night [December 10], there were\nopened before me some matters that I must communicate to you. I\nhave been shown that you are making some sad mistakes. In your\nstudy of the Scriptures and of the Testimonies, you have come to\nwrong conclusions. The Lord\u2019s work would be greatly misunder-\nstood if you should continue to labor as you have begun. You place\na false interpretation upon the Word of God, and upon the printed\nTestimonies; and then you seek to carry on a strange work in accor-\ndance with your conception of their meaning. You suppose that all\nyou do is for the glory of God, but you are deceiving yourselves and\ndeceiving others.\nYour wife, in speech, in song, and in strange exhibitions that\nare not in accordance with the genuine work of the Holy Spirit, is\nhelping to bring in a phase of fanaticism that would do great injury\nto the cause of God, if allowed any place in our churches.\nOn Casting Out Demons\u2014You have even supposed that power\nis given you to cast out devils. Through your influence over the\nhuman mind men and women are led to believe that they are pos-\nsessed of devils, and that the Lord has appointed you as His agents\nfor casting out these evil spirits.\nI have been shown that just such phases of error as I was com-\npelled to meet among Advent believers after the passing of the time\nin 1844, will be repeated in these last days. In our early experience,\nI had to go from place to place and bear message after message to\ndisappointed companies of believers. The evidences accompanying\nmy messages were so great that the honest in heart received as truth\nthe words that were spoken. The power of God was revealed in a\nmarked manner, and men and women were freed from the baleful\ninfluence of fanaticism and disorder, and were brought into the unity\nof the faith.\u2014Letter 358, 1908 (Published in The Review and Herald,\nAugust 10, 17, 24, 1972.)\nMackin Case 337\nCall a Halt\u2014My brother and sister, I have a message for you: [377]\nyou are starting on a false supposition. There is much of self woven\ninto your exhibitions. Satan will come in with bewitching power,\nthrough these exhibitions. It is high time that you call a halt. If God\nhad given you a special message for His people, you would walk and\nwork in all humility\u2014not as if you were on the stage of a theater,\nbut in the meekness of a follower of the lowly Jesus of Nazareth.\nYou would carry an influence altogether different from that which\nyou have been carrying. You would be anchored on the Rock, Christ\nJesus.\nMy dear young friends, your souls are precious in the sight of\nHeaven. Christ has bought you with His own precious blood, and I\ndo not want you to be indulging a false hope, and working in false\nlines. You are certainly on a false track now, and I beg of you, for\nyour souls sake, to imperil no longer the cause of truth for these last\ndays. For your own souls\u2019 sake, consider that the manner in which\nyou are working is not the way God\u2019s cause is to be advanced. The\nsincere desire to do others good will lead the Christian worker to put\naway all thought of bringing into the message of present truth any\nstrange teachings leading men and women into fanaticism. At this\nperiod of the world\u2019s history, we must exercise the greatest of care\nin this respect.\nSome of the phases of experience through which you are passing,\nnot only endanger your own souls, but the souls of many others;\nbecause you appeal to the precious words of Christ as recorded in\nthe Scriptures, and to the Testimonies, to vouch for the genuineness\nof your message. In supposing that the precious Word, which is\nverity and truth, and the Testimonies that the Lord has given for\nHis people, are your authority, you are deceived. You are moved by\nwrong impulses, and are bracing up yourselves with declarations\nthat mislead. You attempt to make the truth of God sustain false\nsentiments and incorrect actions that are inconsistent and fanatical.\nThis makes tenfold, yes, twentyfold harder the work of the church in [378]\nacquainting the people with the truths of the third angel\u2019s message.\u2014\nLetter 358, 1908 (Published in part in Selected Messages 2:44-46.)\n338 Selected Messages Book 3\nAnother Reference to Demon Possession\nLast night instruction was given me for our people. I seemed\nto be in a meeting where representations were being made of the\nstrange work of Brother Mackin and wife. I was instructed that it\nwas a work similar to that which was carried on in Orrington, in the\nState of Maine, and in various other places after the passing of the\ntime in 1844. I was bidden to speak decidedly against this fanatical\nwork.\nI was shown that it was not the Spirit of the Lord that was inspir-\ning Brother and Sister Mackin, but the same spirit of fanaticism that\nis ever seeking entrance into the remnant church. Their application\nof Scripture to their peculiar exercises is Scripture misapplied. The\nwork of declaring persons possessed of the devil, and then praying\nwith them and pretending to cast out the evil spirits, is fanaticism\nwhich will bring into disrepute any church which sanctions such\nwork.\nI was shown that we must give no encouragement to these demon-\nstrations, but must guard the people with a decided testimony against\nthat which would bring a stain upon the name of Seventh-day Ad-\nventists, and destroy the confidence of the people in the message\nof truth which they must bear to the world. [Several communica-\ntions regarding the Mackin experience are published in Selected\nMessages 2:41-47.]\u2014Pacific Union Recorder, December 31, 1908\n(Republished in Selected Messages 2:46.)\nSection 11\u2014Last-Day Events [379]\nIntroduction[380]\nWith the focus of Adventism on the return of Christ, the cli-\nmactic last-day events associated with His second coming have ever\nbeen a theme of major interest to Seventh-day Adventists. It could\nnot be otherwise, for Seventh-day Adventism sprang from a reli-\ngious milieu, the Millerite Movement, which stressed eschatological\nevents\u2014the resurrection, the last judgment, the punishment of sin\nand sinners.\nThe visions given to Ellen White at the outset of her mission\nbrought the importance of the Seventh-day Sabbath prominently\ninto view as the testing truth, which in the last days would divide\nthe inhabitants of the earth into two classes\u2014those who obey God\nand will be eternally saved and those who reject His law and will be\neternally lost. The attitude of the individual toward the Seventh-day\nSabbath would be the determining factor.\nThe closing events of this earth\u2019s history highlighted the little\n219-page Great Controversy published in 1858, and were the cru-\ncial, climatic issue of the great controversy depictions in the books\nbearing that title issued in 1884, 1888, and 1911.\nHow carefully Adventists have studied the closing chapters of\nthis book, and have thrilled at the inspired picture of what is before\nthe church and the world! With no abating of interest they have\nscrutinized all the published Ellen G. White writings for kindred\nstatements that might throw some added light on coming events.\nIn this section we present for the first time a number of heretofore\nunpublished eschatological statements, which help to round out the\npicture of the final events of earth\u2019s history.\nAs Sunday law issues intensified in the late 1800\u2019s and agitation[381]\nfor a national Sunday law in the United States increased, Ellen White\nwrote perceptively of \u201cThe Impending Conflict\u201d in Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:711-718, discussing the significance of the issues then\nfacing Seventh-day Adventists, declaring that the church was not\nready for the issue, and conjecturing that God might yet, \u201cin answer\n340\nIntroduction 341\nto the prayers of his people, hold in check the workings of those\nwho are making void His law\u201d (p. 714).\nAs the laws calling for Sunday observance in certain of the\nSouthern States were enforced and Adventists were arrested, im-\nprisoned, and forced to labor in chain gangs for not observing these\nlaws, the Sabbath-Sunday issue took on greater significance and\ncame in for earnest study at the 1889 General Conference session.\nCarefully reviewing the principles involved, Ellen White counseled\ncaution in any action that might be taken by the delegates.\nAgitation for Sunday legislation gradually waned, but in suc-\nceeding years Ellen White kept the issues of the final conflict before\nchurch leaders. Times might have changed, so far as actual perse-\ncution for Sabbath observance was concerned, but the issues and\nthe principles involved remained the same. Since Ellen White\u2019s\ndeath further changes have taken place, but we believe that the same\nprinciples and the same issues will be revived in the coming conflict,\npresent appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThe major portion of this section includes eschatological state-\nments which frequently parallel the presentation given in The Great\nControversy, but which just as often provide new details and new\ninsights. These materials have been divided into three main areas,\nnamely:\n1. Lessons from meeting the Sunday law crisis of the late 1880s\nand early 1890s.\n2. General counsels appropriate for a people approaching the\nend.\n3. Involvements of \u201cthe last great struggle,\u201d with the Sabbath- [382]\nSunday issue as the crucial factor.\nThe reader will note that, while Ellen White calls our attention to\ntrying experiences ahead, which will doubtless include martyrdoms,\nand predicts apostasies in our ranks, she also forecasts large acces-\nsions to the church and gives encouraging assurance of heaven\u2019s\nsustaining grace to God\u2019s loyal people.\nWhite Trustees.\nChapter 55\u2014Lessons From Meeting the Sunday[383]\nLaw Crisis of the Late 1880\u2019s and Early 1890\u2019s\nAssurance as the Clouds Darken in 1884\nGreat things are before us, and we want to call the people from\ntheir indifference to get ready.... We are not now to cast away our\nconfidence, but to have firm assurance, firmer than ever before.\nHitherto hath the Lord helped us, and He will help us to the end.\nWe will look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what the Lord\nhath done for us, to comfort and to save us from the hand of the\ndestroyer....\nWe can but look onward to new perplexities in the coming con-\nflict, but we may well look on what is past as well as what is to come,\nand say, \u201cHitherto hath the Lord helped us\u201d (1 Samuel 7:12). \u201cAs\nthy days, so shall thy strength be\u201d (Deuteronomy 33:25). The trial\nwill not exceed the strength which shall be given us to bear it. Then,\nlet us take up our work just where we find it, without one word of\nrepining, imagining nothing can come, but that strength will come\nproportionate to the trials....\nOur present peace must not be disturbed by anticipated trials, for\nGod will never leave nor forsake one soul who trusts in Him. God is\nbetter unto us than our fears....\nDon\u2019t Borrow Trouble for a Future Crisis\u2014Many will look\naway from present duties, present comfort and blessings, and be[384]\nborrowing trouble in regard to the future crisis. This will be making\na time of trouble beforehand, and we will receive no grace for any\nsuch anticipated troubles.... When the scene of sore conflict comes,\nwe have learned the lesson of holy confidence, of blessed trust, and\nwe place our hands in the hands of Christ, our feet on the Rock of\nAges, and we are secure from storm, from tempest. We are to wait\non our Lord. Jesus will be an ever-present help in every time of\nneed.\u2014Letter 11a, 1884.\n342\nLessons From Meeting the Sunday Law Crisis... 343\nYou inquire in regard to the course which should be pursued to\nsecure the rights of our people to worship according to the dictates\nof our own conscience. This has been a burden on my soul for some\ntime, whether it would be a denial of our faith, and an evidence that\nour trust was not fully in God. But I call to mind many things God\nhas shown me in the past in regard to things of a similar character,\nas the draft [during the American Civil War] and other things. I can\nspeak in the fear of God, it is right we should use every power we\ncan to avert pressure that is being brought to bear upon our people....\n[We are] not to provoke those who have accepted the spurious\nsabbath, an institution of the Papacy, in the place of God\u2019s holy\nSabbath. Their not having the Bible arguments in their favor makes\nthem all the more angry and determined to supply the place of\narguments that are wanting in the Word of God by the power of their\nmight. The force of persecution follows the steps of the dragon.\nTherefore great care should be exercised to give no provocation.\nAnd again, let us as a people, as far as possible, cleanse the camp of\nmoral defilement and aggravating sins....\nAll the policy in the world cannot save us from a terrible sifting,\nand all the efforts made with high authorities will not lift from us\nthe scourging of God, just because sin is cherished. If as a people\nwe do not keep ourselves in the faith and not only advocate with pen\nand voice the commandments of God, but keep them every one, not [385]\nviolating a single precept knowingly, then weakness and ruin will\ncome upon us....\nAppeals of No Avail Without Working of the Holy Spirit \u2014\nAll the struggles to carry our appeals to the highest authorities in our\nland, however earnest and strong and eloquent may be the pleas in\nour favor, will not bring about that which we desire, unless the Lord\nworks by His Holy Spirit in the hearts of those who claim to believe\nthe truth. We may struggle as a mighty man in swimming against\nthe current of Niagara, but we shall fail unless the Lord pleads in\nour behalf. God will be honored among His people. They must be\npure, they must be divested of self, steadfast, unmovable, always\nabounding in the work of the Lord....\nLaws to Exalt the False Sabbath \u2014We are to be ready and\nwaiting for the orders of God. Nations will be stirred to their very\ncenter. Support will be withdrawn from those who proclaim God\u2019s\n344 Selected Messages Book 3\nonly standard of righteousness, the only sure test of character. And\nall who will not bow to the decree of the national councils, and obey\nthe national laws to exalt the sabbath instituted by the man of sin to\nthe disregard of God\u2019s holy day, will feel, not the oppressive power\nof popery alone, but of the Protestant world, the image of the beast....\nThe great issue so near at hand will weed out those whom God\nhas not appointed and He will have a pure, true, sanctified ministry\nprepared for the latter rain....\nA new life is proceeding from satanic agencies to work with a\npower we have not hitherto realized. And shall not a new power\nfrom above take possession of God\u2019s people?\u2014Letter 55, 1886.\nWe must soon wrestle with the powers of the land, and we have\nevery reason to fear that falsehood will gain the mastery. We shall\ncall upon our churches in the name of the Lord to view this struggle\nin its true light. [See Testimonies for the Church 5:711-718, \u201cThe\nImpending Conflict\u201d (1889).\u2014Compilers.] It is a contest between\nthe Christianity of the Old and New Testaments, and the Christianity[386]\nof human tradition and corrupt fables.\nThis contest is to decide whether the pure gospel shall have\nthe field in our nation, or whether the popery of past ages shall\nreceive the right hand of fellowship from Protestantism, and this\npower prevail to restrict religious liberty.... The message must go\nbroadcast, that those who have been imperceptibly tampering with\npopery, not knowing what they were doing, may hear. They are\nfraternizing with popery by compromises and by concessions which\nsurprise the adherents of the papacy....\nGod\u2019s Children in Other Churches\u2014God has children, many\nof them, in the Protestant churches, and a large number in the\nCatholic churches, who are more true to obey the light and to do\n[to] the very best of their knowledge than a large number among\nSabbathkeeping Adventists who do not walk in the light. The Lord\nwill have the message of truth proclaimed, that Protestants may be\nwarned and awakened to the true state of things, and consider the\nworth of the privilege of religious freedom which they have long\nenjoyed.\nSunday Amendment in the United States\u2014This land has been\nthe home of the oppressed, the witness for liberty of conscience,\nand the great center of scriptural light. God has sent messengers [A.\nLessons From Meeting the Sunday Law Crisis... 345\nT. Jones and others.] who have studied their Bibles to find what is\ntruth, and studied the movements of those who are acting their part\nin the fulfilling prophecy in bringing about the religious amendment\nwhich is making void the law of God and thus giving ascendancy\nto the man of sin. And shall no voice be raised of direct warning to\narouse the churches to their danger? Shall we let things drift, and let\nSatan have the victory without a protest? God forbid....\nMany Not in Our Ranks to Come to the Front \u2014There are\nmany souls to come out of the ranks of the world, out of the\nchurches\u2014even the Catholic Church\u2014whose zeal will far exceed [387]\nthat of those who have stood in rank and file to proclaim the truth\nheretofore. For this reason the eleventh hour laborers will receive\ntheir penny. These will see the battle coming and will give the trum-\npet a certain sound. When the crisis is upon us, when the season of\ncalamity shall come, they will come to the front, gird themselves\nwith the whole armor of God, and exalt His law, adhere to the faith\nof Jesus, and maintain the cause of religious liberty which reformers\ndefended with toil and for which they sacrificed their lives....\nA Spurious Sabbath the Issue \u2014A spurious sabbath is pre-\nsented to be legislated into power, compelling the observance of a\nsabbath which God has not enjoined upon man. The persecutions of\nProtestants by Romanism, by which the religion of Jesus Christ was\nalmost annihilated, will be more than rivaled, when Protestantism\nand popery are combined....\nOur own land is to become a battlefield on which is to be carried\non the struggle for religious liberty\u2014to worship God according to\nthe dictates of our own conscience. Then can we not discern the\nwork of the enemy in keeping men asleep who ought to be awake,\nwhose influence shall not be neutral, but wholly and entirely on the\nLord\u2019s side? Shall men cry, Peace and safety, now, when sudden\ndestruction is coming upon the world, when God\u2019s wrath shall be\npoured out?\u2014Manuscript 30, 1889.\nAmerica Can Become the Place of Greatest Peril\nAmerica, ... where the greatest light from heaven has been\nshining upon the people, can become the place of greatest peril and\n346 Selected Messages Book 3\ndarkness because the people do not continue to practice the truth\nand walk in the light....\nThe more nearly we approach the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s\nhistory, the more pronounced will be the work of Satan. Every\nspecies of deception will take the lead to divert the mind from God\nthrough Satan\u2019s devices.\u2014Letter 23c, 1894.\nAn Early View of Sabbath Importance[388]\n[See also Early Writings, 32-34, for the vision in 1847 on the\nimportance of the Sabbath.]\nI saw that we sensed and realized but little of the importance of\nthe Sabbath, to what we yet should realize and know of its impor-\ntance and glory. I saw we knew not what it was yet to ride upon the\nhigh places of the earth and to be fed with the heritage of Jacob. But\nwhen the refreshing and latter rain shall come from the presence of\nthe Lord and the glory of His power, we shall know what it is to be\nfed with the heritage of Jacob and ride upon the high places of the\nearth. Then shall we see the Sabbath more in its importance and\nglory.\nBut we shall not see it in all its glory and importance until the\ncovenant of peace is made with us at the voice of God, and the pearly\ngates of the New Jerusalem are thrown open and swing back on their\nglittering hinges, and the glad and joyful voice of the lovely Jesus is\nheard richer than any music that ever fell on mortal ear bidding us\nenter.\u2014Letter 3, 1851.\nWe must take a firm stand that we will not reverence the first day\nof the week as the Sabbath, for it is not the day that was blessed and\nsanctified by Jehovah, and in reverencing Sunday we should place\nourselves on the side of the great deceiver. The controversy of the\nSabbath will open the subject to the people, and an opportunity will\nbe given that the claims of the genuine Sabbath may be presented....\nThe God-fearing, commandment-keeping people should be dili-\ngent, not only in prayer, but in action, and this will bring the truth\nbefore those who have never heard it....\nWhen the law of God has been made void, and apostasy becomes\na national sin, the Lord will work in behalf of His people.

There is a work to be done for this time in\nfitting a people to stand in the day of trouble, and all must act their\npart in this work. They must be clothed with the righteousness of\nChrist, and be so fortified by the truth that the delusions of Satan\nshall not be accepted by them as genuine manifestations of the power\nof God....\nIt is a solemn time for God\u2019s people, but if they stand close by\nthe bleeding side of Jesus, he will be their defense. He will open\nways that the message of light may come to the great men, to authors\nand lawmakers. They will have opportunities of which you do not\nnow dream, and some of them will boldly advocate the claims of\nGod\u2019s downtrodden law....\nSatan\u2019s Strategy in the Final Conflict\u2014There is now need of\nearnest working men and women who will seek for the salvation\nof souls, for Satan as a powerful general has taken the field, and\nin this last remnant of time he is working through all conceivable\nmethods to close the door against light that God would have come to\nHis people. He is sweeping the whole world into his ranks, and the\nfew who are faithful to God\u2019s requirements are the only ones who\ncan ever withstand him, and even these he is trying to overcome....\nGo to God for yourselves; pray for divine enlightenment, that you\nmay know that you do know what is truth, that when the wonderful\nmiracle-working power shall be displayed, and the enemy shall come\nas an angel of light, you may distinguish between the genuine work\nof God and the imitative work or the powers of darkness....\nA world is to be warned, and when the third angel\u2019s message\ngoes forth with a loud cry, minds will be fully prepared to make [390]\ndecisions for or against the truth. The great change is to be made\nby Satan and his evil angels, united with evil men who will fix their\n348 Selected Messages Book 3\ndestiny by making void the law of God in the face of convincing\nevidence from His Word that it is unchangeable and eternal.\nLoud Cry of Third Angel\u2019s Message\u2014The very time of which\nthe prophet has written will come, and the mighty cry of the third\nangel will be heard in the earth, his glory will lighten the world, and\nthe message will triumph, but those who do not walk in its light will\nnot triumph with it....\nThe solemn time has come when ministers should be weeping\nbetween the porch and the altar, crying, \u201cSpare thy people, O Lord,\nand give not thine heritage to reproach\u201d (Joel 2:17). It is a day when,\ninstead of lifting up their souls in self-sufficiency, ministers and\npeople should be confessing their sins before God and one another.\nAn Army of Believers Who Stand the Last Test\u2014The law of\nGod is made void, and even among those who advocate its binding\nclaims are some who break its sacred precepts. The Bible will be\nopened from house to house, and men and women will find access to\nthese homes, and minds will be opened to receive the Word of God;\nand, when the crisis comes, many will be prepared to make right\ndecisions, even in the face of the formidable difficulties that will be\nbrought about through the deceptive miracles of Satan. Although\nthese will confess the truth and become workers with Christ at the\neleventh hour, they will receive equal wages with those who have\nwrought through the whole day. There will be an army of steadfast\nbelievers who will stand as firm as a rock through the last test....\nIncreased light will shine upon all the grand truths of prophecy,\nand they will be seen in freshness and brilliancy, because the bright\nbeams of the Sun of Righteousness will illuminate the whole....\nWhen the angel was about to unfold to Daniel the intensely[391]\ninteresting prophecies to be recorded for us who are to witness\ntheir fulfillment, the angel said, \u201cBe strong, yea, be strong\u201d (Daniel\n10:19).

The causes\nof these unusual conditions are being searched for, but in vain.\nGod has not restrained the powers of darkness from carrying\nforward their deadly work of vitiating the air, one of the sources of\nlife and nutrition, with a deadly miasma.

These elements, once broken\nloose, will sweep away the treasures of those who for years have been\nadding to their wealth by securing large possessions at starvation\nprices from those in their employ.\nAnd the religious world too, is to be terribly shaken, for the end\nof all things is at hand.... All society is ranging into two great classes, [392]\nthe obedient and the disobedient....\nThere Will Be Laws Controlling Conscience\u2014The so-called\nChristian world is to be the theater of great and decisive actions.\nMen in authority will enact laws controlling the conscience, after the\nexample of the papacy. Babylon will make all nations drink of the\nwine of the wrath of her fornication.

And I heard another voice from heaven,\nsaying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her\nsins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached\nunto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Reward her\neven as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according\nto her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.\nHow much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much\n350 Selected Messages Book 3\ntorment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen,\nand am no widow, and shall see no sorrow\u201d (Revelation 18:3-7).\nOne Universal Confederacy\u2014\u201cThese have one mind, and shall\ngive their power and strength unto the beast.

In this warfare\nthe Sabbath of the fourth commandment will be the great point at\nissue, for in the Sabbath commandment the great Lawgiver identifies\nHimself as the Creator of the heavens and the earth....\nIn Revelation we read concerning Satan: \u201cAnd he doeth great\nwonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth\nin the sight of men, and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the\nmeans of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the\nbeast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make\nan image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did\nlive. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that\nthe image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as\nwould not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

Satan, in\ncooperation with his angels and with evil men, will put forth every\neffort to gain the victory, and will appear to succeed. But from\nthis conflict, truth and righteousness will come forth triumphant in\nvictory. Those who have believed a lie will be defeated, for the days\nof apostasy will be ended.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1891.\nCounsel Relating to Sunday Law Issues [394]\nThere have arisen in our conference questions that need to have\ncareful attention, whether the Sabbathkeepers in the Southern States,\nwhere they are liable to feel the oppressive power of their State laws\nif they labor on Sunday, shall rest on Sunday to avoid the persecution\nwhich must come if they do any labor. [The 1889 General Confer-\nence session was held in Battle Creek, October 18 to November\n5. On Sabbath, November 2, Ellen White spoke in the morning on\nRevelation 13, \u201claying out in clear lines the position of the people of\nGod for this time in regard to Sunday laws.\u201d Sabbath afternoon she\nread from the Testimonies and an 1883 General Conference sermon\nrelating to the same subject. Neither presentation was reported.\u2014\nCompilers.] Some of our brethren seem anxious that a resolution\nshall be passed by the General Conference advising our Sabbath-\nkeeping brethren liable to imprisonment and fines, to refrain from\nlabor on that day. Such resolutions should not be placed before this\nconference, requiring their action.\nThere are questions about which it is far better to have as little\nnotoriety given as possible, in either case\u2014for or against....\nGod Will Give Light and Knowledge When Needed\u2014When\nthe Sunday question is legislated to become a law, there will not be\nso great a danger of taking steps that are not of a character to receive\nthe sanction of Heaven ... for the reason that the Lord gives light\nand knowledge just when it is most needed....\n352 Selected Messages Book 3\nWhile all Sabbathkeepers are anxious and troubled, seeking to\npenetrate the mysteries of the future, and to learn all they can in\nregard to the correct position they shall take, be careful that they are\nadvised correctly in regard to Sunday observance.... There will ever\nbe danger of going to extremes....\nIf the decision is made that our people shall not labor on Sun-\nday and that our brethren in the Southern States [At the time this\nmanuscript was written Seventh-day Adventists in some of the\nSouthern States were being persecuted because of violation of State\nSunday laws. Some of these Adventists refusing to pay fines im-\nposed were put in chain gangs.] shall appear to harmonize with the\nSunday law, because of oppression, how long before all over the[395]\nworld [our people] shall be in like circumstances as they are in the\nSouth. The decision is to be a universal one. If it comes to the light\nof day as it will in degrees and there will be concessions and servile\nbowing to an idol god by those who claim to be Sabbathkeepers,\nthere will be a yielding of principles until all is lost to them.\nIf we counsel them not to respect the idol sabbath exalted to take\nthe place of the Sabbath of the Lord our God, then instruct them\nin this matter in a quiet way and encourage no defying of the law\npowers in words or actions unless called to do this for the honor of\nGod to vindicate his downtrodden law. Let there be no unnecessary\nact of arousing the combative spirit or passions of opponents....\nThere should be no just occasion to our enemies to charge us with\nbeing lawless and defying the laws through any imprudence of our\nown. [See Testimonies for the Church 9:232-238, \u201cSunday Labor.\u201d]\nWe should not feel it enjoined upon us to irritate our neighbors who\nidolize Sunday by making determined efforts to bring labor on that\nday before them purposely to exhibit an independence....\nThere should be no noisy demonstration. Let us consider how\nfearful and terribly sad is the delusion that has taken the world cap-\ntive and by every means in our power seek to enlighten those who are\nour bitterest enemies. If there is the acceptance of the principles of\nthe inworking of the Holy Ghost which he [the Christian] must have\nto fit him for heaven, he will do nothing rashly or presumptuously\nto create wrath and blasphemy against God....\nHow You Treat the Sabbath Question Is Decisive\u2014There are\nsome trying testimonies to be manfully borne by Sabbathkeepers\nLessons From Meeting the Sunday Law Crisis... 353\nand some bitter persecution finally endured.... Let no resolutions be\npassed here which will encourage half-hearted service or cowardly\nhiding our light under a bushel or under a bed, for we will certainly [396]\nbe tried and tested.... Be sure the Sabbath is a test question, and how\nyou treat this question places you either on God\u2019s side or Satan\u2019s\nside. The mark of the beast is to be presented in some shape to every\ninstitution and every individual....\nEvery move from the first made by Satan was the beginning of\nhis work to continue to the end to exalt the false, to take the place of\nthe genuine Sabbath of Jehovah. He is just as intent now and more\ndetermined to do this than ever before. He has come down with\ngreat power to deceive them who dwell on the earth with his satanic\ndelusions....\nAs we meet the emergency, the law of God becomes more pre-\ncious, more sacred, and as it is more manifestly made void and set\naside, in proportion should arise our respect and reverence for the\nlaw....\nIn the exercise of the longsuffering of God, He gives to nations\na certain period of probation, but there is a point which, if they pass,\nthere will be the visitation of God in His indignation. He will punish.\nThe world has been advancing from one degree of contempt for\nGod\u2019s law to another, and the prayer may be appropriate at this time,\n\u201cIt is time for thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void thy law\u201d\n(Psalm 119:126)....\nIndividuals to Take Responsibility\u2014Let not anyone make any\nproud boast, either by precept or example, to show that he is defying\nthe laws of the land. Make no resolutions as to what persons in\ndifferent states may do, or may not do. Let nothing be done to lessen\nindividual responsibility. To their God they must stand or fall. Let\nnone feel it is his duty to make speeches in the presence of our own\npeople, or of our enemies, that will arouse their combativeness, and\nthey take your words and construe them in such a way that you are\ncharged with being rebellious to the government, for this will close\nthe door of access to the people....\nWhile we cannot bow to an arbitrary power to lift up the Sunday\nby bowing to it, while we will not violate the Sabbath, which a\ndespotic power will seek to compel us to do, we will be wise in [397]\nChrist.... We must say no words, that will do ourselves harm, for\n354 Selected Messages Book 3\nthis would be bad enough, but when you speak words, and when\nyou do presumptuous things that imperil the cause of God, you are\ndoing a cruel work, for you give Satan advantage. We are not to be\nrash and impetuous, but always learning of Jesus, how to act in His\nspirit, presenting the truth as it is in Jesus....\nDanger of Hasty, Ill-advised Moves \u2014One indiscreet, high-\ntempered, stubborn-willed man will, in the great question introduced\nbefore us, do much harm. Yes, he will leave such an impression that\nall the force of Seventh-day Adventists could not counteract his acts\nof presumption because Satan, the arch deceiver, the great rebel, is\ndeluding minds to the true issue of the great question, and its eternal\nbearing....\nThere are those who will, through hasty, ill-advised moves, be-\ntray the cause of God into the enemy\u2019s power. There will be men\nwho will seek to be revenged, who will become apostates and betray\nChrist in the person of His saints. All need to learn discretion; then\nthere is danger on the other hand of being conservative, of giving\naway to the enemy in concessions....\nAnything we may do that lifts up the spurious to take the place\nof the true and genuine Sabbath, is disloyal to God, and we must\nmove very carefully, lest we exalt the decisions of the man of sin.\nWe are not to be found in a neutral position on this matter of so great\nconsequence....\nPersecution in the Battle Before the Last Closing Conflict\u2014\nThe two armies will stand distinct and separate, and this distinction\nwill be so marked that many who shall be convinced of the truth will\ncome on the side of God\u2019s commandment-keeping people. When\nthis grand work is to take place in the battle, prior to the last closing\nconflict, many will be imprisoned, many will flee for their lives\nfrom cities and towns, and many will be martyrs for Christ\u2019s sake\nin standing in defense of the truth.... You will not be tempted above\nwhat you are able to bear. Jesus bore all this and far more.... [398]\nWork of Wolves in Sheep\u2019s Clothing \u2014There will be, even\namong us, hirelings and wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing who will per-\nsuade [some of] the flock of God to sacrifice unto other gods before\nthe Lord.... Youth who are not established, rooted and grounded in\nthe truth, will be corrupted and drawn away by the blind leaders of\nthe blind; and the ungodly, the despisers that wonder and perish,\nLessons From Meeting the Sunday Law Crisis... 355\nwho despise the sovereignty of the Ancient of Days, and place on the\nthrone a false god, a being of their own defining, a being altogether\nsuch an one as themselves\u2014these agents will be in Satan\u2019s hands to\ncorrupt the faith of the unwary.\nSelf-indulgent Will Scorn Faithful Ones\nThose who have been self-indulgent and ready to yield to pride\nand fashion and display, will sneer at the conscientious, truth-loving,\nGod-fearing people, and will in this work sneer at the God of heaven\nHimself....\nIn the name of the Lord I advise all His people to have trust in\nGod and not begin now to prepare to find an easy position for any\nemergency in the future, but to let God prepare for the emergency....\nAs Our Day Will Be Our Strength \u2014When the Christian is\nlooking forward to duties and severe trials that he anticipates are to\nbe brought upon him, because of his Christian profession of faith, it\nis human nature to contemplate the consequences, and shrink from\nthe prospects, and this will be decidedly so as we near the close of\nthis earth\u2019s history. We may be encouraged by the truthfulness of\nGod\u2019s word, that Christ never failed His children as their safe Leader\nin the hour of their trial; for we have the truthful record of those who\nhave been under the oppressive powers of Satan, that His grace is\naccording to their day. God is faithful who will not suffer us to be\ntempted above that we are able....\nThere may be large mountains of difficulties in regard to how\nto meet the claims of God and not stand in defiance of the laws of [399]\nthe land. He [the believer] must not be making ample provisions for\nhimself to shield himself from trial, for he is only God\u2019s instrument\nand he is to go forward in singleness of purpose with his mind and\nsoul garrisoned day by day, that he will not sacrifice one principle\nof his integrity, but he will make no boasts, issue no threats, or tell\nwhat he will or will not do. For he does not know what he will do\nuntil tested....\nWe Are Not to Irritate Sundaykeeping Neighbors \u2014There\nshould be a constant walking in all humility. There should be no\njust occasion for our enemies to charge us with being lawless and\ndefying the laws through any imprudence of our own. We should\n356 Selected Messages Book 3\nnot feel it enjoined upon us to irritate our neighbors who idolize\nSunday by making determined efforts to bring labor on that day\nbefore them purposely to exhibit an independence. Our sisters need\nnot select Sunday as the day to exhibit their washing. There should\nbe no noisy demonstration. Let us consider how fearful and terribly\nsad is the delusion that has taken the world captive and by every\nmeans in our power seek to enlighten those who are our bitterest\nenemies. If there is the acceptance of the principles of the inworking\nof the Holy Ghost which he [the Christian] must have to fit him for\nheaven, he will do nothing rashly or presumptuously to create wrath\nand blasphemy against God....\nNo Deaths Among God\u2019s People After Probation Closes \u2014\nAfter Jesus rises up from the mediatorial throne, every case will be\ndecided, and oppression and death coming to God\u2019s people will not\nthen be a testimony in favor of the truth....\nWe urge you to consider this danger: That which we have most\nto fear is nominal Christianity. We have many who profess the truth\nwho will be overcome because they are not acquainted with the\nLord Jesus Christ. They cannot distinguish His voice from that of\na stranger. There is to be no dread of anyone being borne down\neven in a widespread apostasy, who has a living experience in the[400]\nknowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If Jesus be formed\nwithin, the hope of glory, the illiterate as well as the educated can\nbear the testimony of our faith, saying, \u201cI know in whom I have\nbelieved.\u201d Some will not, in argument, be able to show wherein their\nadversary is wrong, having never had any advantages that others\nhave had, yet these are not overborne by the apostasy, because they\nhave the evidence in their own heart that they have the truth, and the\nmost subtle reasoning and assaults of Satan cannot move them from\ntheir knowledge of the truth, and they have not a doubt or fear that\nthey are themselves in error....\nWhen profligacy and heresy and infidelity fill the land, there will\nbe many humble homes where prayer, sincere and contrite prayer,\nwill be offered from those who have never heard the truth, and there\nwill be many hearts that will carry a weight of oppression for the\ndishonor done to God. We are too narrow in our ideas, we are poor\njudges, for many of these will be accepted of God because they\nLessons From Meeting the Sunday Law Crisis... 357\ncherish every ray of light that shone upon them.\u2014Manuscript 6,\n1889.\nPay Fine if It Will Deliver From the Oppressor\nMen are inspired by Satan to execute his purposes against God.\nThe Lord has said, \u201cVerily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign\nbetween me and you throughout your generations\u201d (Exodus 31:13).\nNone should disobey this command in order to escape persecution.\nBut let all consider the words of Christ, \u201cWhen they persecute you in\nthis city, flee ye into another\u201d (Matthew 10:23). If it can be avoided,\ndo not put yourselves into the power of men who are worked by the\nspirit of Antichrist. If the payment of a fine will deliver our brethren\nfrom the hands of these oppressors, let it be paid, rather than to be\npressed and made to work on the Sabbath. Everything that we can\ndo should be done that those who are willing to suffer for the truth\u2019s\nsake may be saved from oppression and cruelty....\nWhen men under conviction resist light, follow their own incli- [401]\nnations, and regard the favor of men above the favor of God, they do\nas did many in Christ\u2019s day....\nCommandments Not to Be Ignored in Order to Have an\nEasy Time\u2014Christ is our example. The determination of Antichrist\nto carry out the rebellion he began in heaven will continue to work\non the children of disobedience. Their envy and hatred against those\nwho obey the fourth commandment will wax more and more bitter.\nBut the people of God are not to hide their banner. They are not\nto ignore the commandments of God, and in order to have an easy\ntime go with the multitude to do evil. They should be careful not to\ncondemn their brethren in the faith who are steadfast, immovable,\nalways abounding in the work of the Lord....\nThose who forsake God in order to save their lives will be for-\nsaken by Him. In seeking to save their lives by yielding the truth,\nthey will lose eternal life.\nNatural affection for relatives and friends should not lead any\nsoul who sees the light to reject the light, to dishonor God the Father\nand Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son. Every possible excuse for\ndisobedience will be framed by men who choose, as many did in\nChrist\u2019s day, the favor of men rather than the favor of God. If one\n358 Selected Messages Book 3\nchooses wife or children, father or mother, before Christ, that choice\nwill stand through eternal ages, with all its weight of responsibility....\nThe soul that has had light in regard to the Lord\u2019s Sabbath, His\nmemorial of creation, and to save himself from inconvenience and\nreproach has chosen to remain disloyal, has sold his Lord. He has\ndishonored the name of Christ, he has taken his stand with the armies\nof Antichrist; with them at the last great day, he will be found outside\nthe city of God, not with the loyal, the true and righteous, in the\nheavenly kingdom.\nAll who have genuine faith will be tested and tried. They may\nhave to forsake houses and lands, and even their own relatives,\nbecause of bitter opposition. \u201cBut when they persecute you in this[402]\ncity, flee ye into another,\u201d Christ said. \u201cYe shall not have gone over\nthe cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come\u201d (Matthew 10:23).\nAntichrist\u2014Those Who Exalt Themselves Against God\u2014\nWill Feel His Wrath\u2014The greater man\u2019s influence for good, under\nthe control of the Spirit of God, the more determined will be the\nenemy to indulge his envy and jealousy toward him by religious\npersecution. But all heaven is on the side of Christ, not of Antichrist.\nThose who love God and are willing to be partakers with Christ in\nhis sufferings, God will honor. Antichrist, meaning all who exalt\nthemselves against the will and work of God, will at the appointed\ntime feel the wrath of Him who gave Himself that they might not\nperish but have eternal life. All who persevere in obedience, all who\nwill not sell their souls for money or for the favor of men, God will\nregister in the book of life.\u2014Manuscript 9, 1900.\nChapter 56\u2014As We Near the End [403]\nMisleading Messages Will Be Accepted by Many\nTest everything before it shall be presented to the flock of God....\nIn messages that profess to be from Heaven, expressions will be\nmade that are misleading, and if the influence of these things be\naccepted, it will lead to exaggerated movements, plans, and devising\nthat will bring in the very things that Satan would have current\u2014a\nstrange spirit, an unclean spirit, under the garments of sanctity; a\nstrong spirit to overbear everything. Fanaticism will come in, and\nwill so mingle and interweave itself with the workings of the Spirit\nof God, that many will accept it all as from God, and will be deceived\nand misled thereby.\nThere are strong statements often made by our brethren who bear\nthe message of mercy and warning to our world, that would better\nbe repressed.... Let not one word be expressed to stir up the spirit of\nretaliation in opposers of the truth. Let nothing be done to arouse\nthe dragonlike spirit, for it will reveal itself soon enough, and in all\nits dragon character, against those who keep the commandments of\nGod and have the faith of Jesus....\nConfronted by Our Carelessly Spoken Words\u2014The time will\ncome when we shall be called to stand before Kings and rulers, [404]\nmagistrates and powers, in vindication of the truth. Then it will\nbe a surprise to those witnesses to learn that their positions, their\nwords, the very expressions made in a careless manner or thoughtless\nway, when attacking error or advancing truth\u2014expressions that they\nhad not thought would be remembered\u2014will be reproduced, and\nthey will be confronted with them, and their enemies will have the\nadvantage, putting their own construction on these words that were\nspoken unadvisedly....\nHow Satan Will Work to Deceive\u2014Many things intended to\ndeceive us will come, bearing some of the marks of truth. Just as\nsoon as these shall be set forth as the great power of God, Satan is\n359\n360 Selected Messages Book 3\nall ready to weave in that which he has prepared to lead souls from\nthe truth for this time.\nSome will accept and promulgate the error, and when the reproof\ncomes that will place matters in the true light, those who have had\nlittle experience and who are ignorant of the oft-repeated workings\nof Satan, will cast away with the rubbish of error that which has\nbeen before them as truth. Thus the light and warnings which God\ngives for this time will be made of no effect....\nFalse Messages Will Be Charged Upon Ellen White\u2014Every\nconceivable message is coming to counterfeit the work of God, and\nalways bearing the inscription of truth upon its banner. And those\nwho are prepared for anything new and sensational, will handle\nthese things in such a manner that our enemies will charge all that is\ninconsistent and overdone upon Mrs. E. G.

One after another will rise up, appearing to be inspired,\nwhen they have not the inspiration of heaven, but are under the\ndeception of the enemy. All who receive their messages will be led\nastray. Then let us walk carefully, and not open wide the door for\nthe enemy to enter through impressions, dreams, and visions. God\nhelp us to look in faith to Jesus, and be guided by the words He has[405]\nspoken.\u2014Letter 66, 1894.\nSteadfastness, but No Defiance\nWe are to fix the eye of faith steadfastly upon Jesus. When the\ndays come, as they surely will, in which the law of God is made void,\nthe zeal of the true and loyal should rise with the emergency, and\nshould be the more warm and decided, and their testimony should\nbe the more positive and unflinching. But we are to do nothing in a\ndefiant spirit, and we shall not, if our hearts are fully surrendered to\nGod....\nSatan\u2019s Wrath Against the Three Angels\u2019 Messages \u2014The\nthird angel is represented as flying in the midst of heaven, symbol-\nizing the work of those who proclaim the first, second, and third\nangel\u2019s messages; all are linked together. The evidences of the abid-\ning, everliving truth of these grand messages that mean so much to\nus, that have awakened such intense opposition from the religious\nAs We Near the End 361\nworld, are not extinct. Satan is constantly seeking to cast his hellish\nshadow about these messages, so that the remnant people of God\nshall not clearly discern their import\u2014their time and place\u2014but\nthey live, and are to exert their power upon our religious experience\nwhile time shall last....\nThe Revelator says, \u201cI saw another angel come down from\nheaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his\nglory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon\nthe great is fallen, is fallen\u201d (Revelation 18:1, 2). This is the same\nmessage that was given by the second angel\u2014Babylon is fallen,\n\u201cbecause she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her\nfornication\u201d (chap 14:8). What is that wine? Her false doctrines.\nShe has given to the world a false sabbath instead of the Sabbath\nof the fourth commandment, and has repeated the lie Satan first\ntold to Eve in Eden\u2014the natural immortality of the soul. Many\nkindred errors she has spread far and wide, \u201cteaching for doctrines\nthe commandments of men.\u201d\nTwo Distinct Calls to the Churches\u2014When Jesus began His [406]\npublic ministry, He cleansed the temple from its sacrilegious profa-\nnation. Almost the last act of His ministry was to cleanse the temple\nagain. So in the last work for the warning of the world, two distinct\ncalls are made to the churches; the second angel\u2019s message, and the\nvoice heard in heaven, \u201cCome out of her, my people.... For her sins\nhave reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities\u201d\n(Revelation 18:4, 5).\nAs God called the children of Israel out of Egypt, that they might\nkeep His Sabbath, so He calls His people out of Babylon that they\nmay not worship the beast nor his image. The man of sin, who\nthought to change times and laws, has exalted himself above God by\npresenting this spurious sabbath to the world; the Christian world\nhas accepted this child of the Papacy, and cradled and nourished it,\nthus defying God by removing His memorial and setting up a rival\nsabbath.\nA More Decided Effort to Exalt Sunday\u2014After the truth has\nbeen proclaimed as a witness to all nations, at a time when every\nconceivable power of evil is set in operation, when minds are con-\nfused by the many voices crying, \u201cLo, here is Christ,\u201d \u201cLo, He is\nthere,\u201d \u201cThis is truth,\u201d \u201cI have a message from God,\u201d \u201cHe has sent\n362 Selected Messages Book 3\nme with great light,\u201d and there is a removing of the landmarks, and\nan attempt to tear down the pillars of our faith\u2014then a more decided\neffort is made to exalt the false sabbath, and to cast contempt upon\nGod Himself by supplanting the day He has blessed and sanctified.\nWhile Satan Works the Angel of Revelation 18 Proclaims\nHis Message\u2014This false sabbath is to be enforced by an oppres-\nsive law. Satan and his angels are wide awake and intensely active,\nworking with energy and perseverance through human instrumen-\ntalities to bring about his purpose of obliterating the knowledge of\nGod. While Satan is working with his lying wonders, the time has\ncome [that was] foretold in the Revelation, when the mighty angel\nthat shall lighten the earth with his glory will proclaim the fall of\nBabylon and call upon God\u2019s people to forsake her.... [407]\nRepairers of the Breach \u2014As the end approaches, the testi-\nmonies of God\u2019s servants will become more decided and more pow-\nerful, flashing the light of truth upon the systems of error and op-\npression that have so long held the supremacy. The Lord has sent\nus messages for this time to establish Christianity upon an eternal\nbasis, and all who believe present truth must stand, not in their own\nwisdom, but in God; and raise up the foundation of many genera-\ntions. These will be registered in the books of heaven as repairers of\nthe breach, the restorers of paths to dwell in. We are to maintain the\ntruth because it is truth, in the face of the bitterest opposition....\nTemptations will come upon us. Iniquity abounds where you\nleast expect it. Dark chapters will open that are most terrible, to\nweigh down the soul; but we need not fail nor be discouraged while\nwe know that the bow of promise is above the throne of God.\nWe shall be subject to heavy trials, opposition, bereavement,\naffliction; but we know that Jesus passed through all these. These\nexperiences are valuable to us. The advantages are not by any means\nconfined to this short life. They reach into eternal ages....\nAs we near the close of this earth\u2019s history, we advance more\nand more rapidly in Christian growth, or we retrograde just as de-\ncidedly.\u2014Letter 1f, 1890.\nAs We Near the End 363\nBacksliding SDA\u2019s Unite With Unbelievers\nSatan is Christ\u2019s personal enemy.... Long has he deceived\nmankind, and great is his power over the human family; and his\nrage against the people of God increases as he finds that the knowl-\nedge of God\u2019s requirements is extending to all parts of the world,\nand that the light of present truth is shining to those who have long\nsat in darkness....\nThe Word of God ... is to be our defense when Satan works with\nsuch lying wonders that, if it were possible, he would deceive the\nvery elect. It is then that those who have not stood firmly for the [408]\ntruth will unite with the unbelieving, who love and make a lie. When\nthese wonders are performed, when the sick are healed and other\nmarvels are wrought, they will be deceived. Are we prepared for\nthe perilous times that are right upon us? Or are we standing where\nwe will fall an easy prey to the wiles of the devil?\u2014Manuscript 81,\n1908.\nA Science of the Devil\nWhat is soon coming upon us? Seducing spirits are coming\nin. If God has ever spoken by me, you will before long hear of a\nwonderful science\u2014a science of the devil. Its aim will be to make\nof no account God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Some will\nexalt this false science, and through them Satan will seek to make\nvoid the law of God. Great miracles will be performed in the sight\nof men in behalf of this wonderful science.\u2014Letter 48, 1907.\nThe Time of Apostasy is Here\nThe end of all things is near at hand.

It is stated in\nthe Word that the enemy will work through his agents who have\ndeparted from the faith, and they will seemingly work miracles, even\nto the bringing down of fire out of heaven in the sight of men.

It is Satan\u2019s object now to get up new theories to divert\nthe mind from the true work and genuine message for this time. He\nstirs up minds to give false interpretation of Scripture, a spurious\nloud cry, that the real message may not have its effect when it does\ncome. This is one of the greatest evidences that the loud cry will\nsoon be heard and the earth will be lightened with the glory of\nGod.\u2014Letter 20, 1884.\nEvil Angels in the Form of Believers Will Work in Our Ranks\nI have been shown that evil angels in the form of believers will\nwork in our ranks to bring in a strong spirit of unbelief.

Our churches must be aroused, must be instructed,\nthat they may give the warning to all whom they can possibly reach,\ndeclaring that the sword is coming, that the Lord\u2019s anger upon a\nprofligate world will not long be deferred.

It is then their privilege to\n374 Selected Messages Book 3\nfollow the example of their Master and go to another place.\u2014Letter\n20, 1901.\nMartyrdom God\u2019s Means of Bringing Many Into Truth\nThe worthies who refused to bow to the golden image were cast\ninto a burning fiery furnace, but Christ was with them there, and the\nfire did not consume them....\nNow some of us may be brought to just as severe a test\u2014will we\nobey the commandments of men or will we obey the commandments\nof God? This is the question that will be asked of many. The best\nthing for us is to come into close connection with God, and, if He\nwould have us be martyrs for the truth\u2019s sake, it may be the means\nof bringing many more into the truth.\u2014Manuscript 83, 1886.\nChrist Stands by the Side of Persecuted Saints\nNever is the tempest-tried soul more dearly loved by his Saviour\nthan when he is suffering reproach for the truth\u2019s sake. When for the\ntruth\u2019s sake the believer stands at the bar of unrighteous tribunals,\nChrist stands by his side. All the reproaches that fall upon the human\nbeliever fall upon Christ in the person of His saints. \u201cI will love him,\u201d\nsaid Christ, \u201cand will manifest myself to him\u201d (John 14:21). Christ\nis condemned over again in the person of His believing disciples.\nWhen for the truth\u2019s sake the believer is incarcerated in prison\nwalls, Christ manifests Himself to him, and ravishes his heart with\nHis love. When he suffers death for the sake of Christ, Christ says\nto him, \u201cThey may kill the body, but they cannot hurt the soul.\u201d \u201cBe\nof good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d \u201cThey crucified Me, and\nif they put you to death, they crucify Me afresh in the person of My[421]\nsaints.\u201d\nPersecution cannot do more than cause death, but the life is\npreserved to eternal life and glory. The persecuting power may take\nits stand, and command the disciples of Christ to deny the faith, to\ngive heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, by making void\nthe law of God. But the disciples may ask, \u201cWhy should I do this? I\nlove Jesus, and I will never deny His name.\u201d When the power says,\n\u201cI will call you a disturber of the peace,\u201d they may answer, \u201cThus\nLast Great Struggle 375\nthey called Jesus, who was truth, and grace and peace.\u201d\u2014Letter 116,\n1896.\nMerchants and Princes Will Take Their Stand\nSome who are numbered among merchants and princes will take\ntheir position to obey the truth. God\u2019s eye has been upon such as\nthey have acted according to the light they have had, maintaining\ntheir integrity. Cornelius, a man of high position, maintained his\nreligious experience, strictly walking in accordance with the light\nhe had received. God had His eye upon him, and He sent His angel\nwith a message to him. The heavenly messenger passed by the\nself-righteous ones, came to Cornelius, and called him by name....\nThis record is made for the special benefit of those who are\nliving in these last days. Many who have had great light have not\nappreciated and improved it as it was their privilege to do. They\nhave not practiced the truth. And because of this the Lord will bring\nin those who have lived up to all the light they have had. And those\nwho have been privileged with opportunities to understand the truth\nand who have not obeyed its principles will be swayed by Satan\u2019s\ntemptations for self-advancement. They will deny the principles of\ntruth in practice and bring reproach upon the cause of God.\nChrist declares that He will spue these out of His mouth, and\nleave them to follow their own course of actions to distinguish\nthemselves. This course of action does indeed make them prominent\nas men that are unfaithful householders.\nGod\u2019s Measurement of Those Who Walk in the Light They [422]\nHave\u2014The Lord will give His message to those who have walked\nin accordance with the light they have had, and will recognize them\nas true and faithful, according to the measurement of God. These\nmen will take the place of those who, having light and knowledge,\nhave walked not in the way of the Lord, but in the imagination of\ntheir own unsanctified hearts.\nWe are now living in the last days, when the truth must be\nspoken, when in reproof and warning it must be given to the world,\nirrespective of consequences. If there are some who will become\noffended and turn from the truth, we must bear in mind that there\nwere those who did the same in Christ\u2019s day....\n376 Selected Messages Book 3\nThe Ranks Will Not Be Diminished\u2014But there are men who\nwill receive the truth, and these will take the places made vacant by\nthose who become offended and leave the truth.... The Lord will\nwork so that the disaffected ones will be separated from the true\nand loyal ones.... The ranks will not be diminished. Those who are\nfirm and true will close up the vacancies that are made by those who\nbecome offended and apostatize....\nMany will prize the wisdom of God above any earthly advantage,\nand will obey the Word of God as the supreme standard. These\nwill be led to great light. These will come to the knowledge of\nthe truth, and will seek to get this light of truth before those of\ntheir acquaintance who like themselves are anxious for the truth.\u2014\nManuscript 97, 1898.\nEvery Human Being Will Be Either in Christ\u2019s Army or\nSatan\u2019s Army\nWe are nearing the close of this earth\u2019s history, when two parties\nalone can exist, and every man, woman, and child will be in one of\nthese armies. Jesus will be the General of one army; of the opposing\narmy, Satan will be the leader. All who are breaking, and teaching\nothers to break, the law of God, the foundation of His government\nin heaven and in earth, are marshaled under one superior chief, who[423]\ndirects them in opposition to the government of God. And \u201cthe\nangels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation\u201d\n(Jude 6) are rebels against the law of God, and enemies to all who\nlove and obey His commandments. These subjects, with Satan their\nleader, will gather others into their ranks through every possible\nmeans, to strengthen his forces and urge his claims.\nThrough his deception and delusion, Satan would, if possible,\ndeceive the very elect. His is no minor deception. He will seek to\nannoy, to harass, to falsify, to accuse, and misrepresent all whom he\ncannot compel to give him honor and help him in his work. His great\nsuccess lies in keeping men\u2019s minds confused, and ignorant of his\ndevices, for then he can lead the unwary as it were, blindfolded....\nThe Sabbath Is the Issue in the Final Conflict\u2014The Sabbath\nis the great test question. It is the line of demarkation between the\nloyal and true and the disloyal and transgressor. This Sabbath God\nLast Great Struggle 377\nhas enjoined, and those who claim to be commandment keepers,\nwho believe that they are now under the proclamation of the third\nangel\u2019s message, will see the important part the Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment holds in that message. It is the seal of the living God.\nThey will not lessen the claims of the Sabbath to suit their business\nof convenience.\u2014Manuscript 34, 1897.\nJohn in the Revelation writes of the unity of those living on the\nearth to make void the law of God. \u201cThese have one mind, and\nshall give their power and strength unto the beast. These shall make\nwar with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is\nLord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are\ncalled, and chosen, and faithful\u201d (Revelation 17:13, 14). \u201cAnd I saw\nthree unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon,\nand out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false\nprophet\u201d (chap. 16:13).\nAll who will exalt and worship the idol Sabbath, a day that God [424]\nhas not blessed, help the devil and his angels with all the power\nof their God-given ability, which they have perverted to a wrong\nuse. Inspired by another spirit, which blinds their discernment, they\ncannot see that the exaltation of Sunday is entirely the institution of\nthe Catholic Church....\nSabbath Is the Issue That Divides the World \u2014The Lord of\nheaven permits the world to choose whom they will have as ruler.\nLet all read carefully the thirteenth chapter of Revelation, for it\nconcerns every human agent, great and small. Every human being\nmust take sides, either for the true and living God, who has given to\nthe world the memorial of Creation in the seventh-day Sabbath, or\nfor a false sabbath, instituted by men who have exalted themselves\nabove all that is called God or that is worshiped, who have taken\nupon themselves the attributes of Satan, in oppressing the loyal and\ntrue who keep the commandments of God. This persecuting power\nwill compel the worship of the beast by insisting on the observance\nof the sabbath he has instituted. Thus he blasphemes God, sitting \u201cin\nthe temple of God, shewing himself that he is God\u201d (2 Thessalonians\n2:4).\nThe 144,000 Without Guile \u2014One of the marked features in\nthe representation of the 144,000 is that in their mouth there was\nfound no guile. The Lord has said, \u201cBlessed is the man ... in whose\n378 Selected Messages Book 3\nspirit there is no guile.\u201d They profess to be children of God, and are\nrepresented as following the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. They are\nprefigured before us as standing on Mount Zion, girt for holy service,\nclothed in white linen, which is the righteousness of the saints. But\nall who follow the Lamb in heaven will first have followed Him\non earth, in trustful, loving, willing obedience, followed Him not\nfretfully and capriciously, but confidently, truthfully, as the flock\nfollows the shepherd....\nSatan Making his Last Effort for the Mastery\u2014The world is\nin copartnership with the professed Christian churches in making\nvoid the law of Jehovah. God\u2019s law is set aside, it is trampled\nunderfoot; and from all the loyal people of God, the prayer will[425]\nascend to heaven, \u201cIt is time, for thee, Lord, to work: for they have\nmade void thy law\u201d (Psalm 119:126). Satan is making his last and\nmost powerful effort for the mastery, his last conflict against the\nprinciples of God\u2019s law. A defiant infidelity abounds.\nAfter John\u2019s description in Revelation 16 of that miracle-work-\ning power which was to gather the world to the last great conflict,\nthe symbols are dropped, and the trumpet voice once more gives\na certain sound. \u201cBehold, I come as a thief.

And that day must find [426]\nnone of us sleeping. Wide awake we must be, as wise virgins having\noil in our vessels with our lamps.

I saw our people in great\ndistress, weeping and praying, pleading the sure promises of God,\nwhile the wicked were all around us mocking us and threatening\nto destroy us. They ridiculed our feebleness, they mocked at the[428]\nLast Great Struggle 381\nsmallness of our numbers, and taunted us with words calculated to\ncut deep. They charged us with taking an independent position from\nall the rest of the world. They had cut off our resources so that we\ncould not buy or sell, and they referred to our abject poverty and\nstricken condition. They could not see how we could live without\nthe world. We were dependent on the world, and we must concede\nto the customs, practices, and laws of the world, or go out of it. If\nwe were the only people in the world whom the Lord favored, the\nappearances were awfully against us.\nThey declared that they had the truth, that miracles were among\nthem; that angels from heaven talked with them and walked with\nthem, that great power and signs and wonders were performed among\nthem, and that this was the temporal millennium they had been\nexpecting so long. The whole world was converted and in harmony\nwith the Sunday law, and this little feeble people stood out in defiance\nof the laws of the land and the law of God, and claimed to be the\nonly ones right on the earth....\n\u201cLook Up!

C. White before the General Conference\nCouncil, October 30, 1911.\nAddressing the council, Elder W. C. White said:\n\u201cIt is with pleasure that I present to you a statement regarding\nthe latest English edition of Great Controversy.\n\u201cAbout two years ago, we were told that the electrotype plates\nfor this book, in use at the Pacific Press, the Review and Herald,\nand the International Tract Society (London), were so worn that the\nbook must be reset and new plates made. This work has been done\nat the Pacific Press. Four sets of plates were made\u2014one for each of\nour offices in Washington, Mountain View, Nashville, and Watford.\n\u201cIn a letter sent to the managers of our publishing houses, I wrote\nas follows, on July 24, 1911: [This is the same as the letter of the\nsame date that was addressed to \u201cOur General Missionary Agents.\u201d]\n\u201c\u2018After taking counsel with ministers, canvassers, and other\nfriends of the book, we thought best to reset the text so that the\nnew edition would correspond as nearly as possible with the old.\nAnd although we could not use exactly the same type, the matter\nruns nearly page for page. Every chapter in the new edition begins\nand ends on the same pages as does the corresponding chapter in the[434]\nold edition.\n\u201c\u2018The most noticeable change in the new edition is the improve-\nment in the illustrations. Each of the forty-two chapters, together\nwith the Preface, Introduction, Contents, and list of Illustrations,\nhas a beautiful pictorial heading; and ten new full-page illustrations\nhave been introduced, to take the place of those which were least\nattractive.\n\u201c\u2018The thirteen Appendix notes of the old edition, occupying\nthirteen pages, have been replaced by thirty-one notes occupying\ntwelve pages. These are nearly all reference notes, intended to help\n386\nAppendix A 387\nthe studious reader in finding historical proofs of the statements\nmade in the book.\n\u201c\u2018The Biographical Notes have been omitted, and the general\nIndex has been enlarged from twelve to twenty-two pages, thus\ngreatly facilitating the finding of desired passages.\n\u201c\u2018In the body of the book, the most noticeable improvement is the\nintroduction of historical references. In the old edition, over seven\nhundred Biblical references were given, but in only a few instances\nwere there any historical references to the authorities quoted or\nreferred to. In the new edition the reader will find more than four\nhundred references to eighty-eight authors and authorities.\n\u201c\u2018When we presented to Mother the request of some of our\ncanvassers, that there should be given in the new edition not only\nScripture references but also references to the historians quoted, she\ninstructed us to hunt up and insert the historical references. She also\ninstructed us to verify the quotations, and to correct any inaccuracies\nfound; and where quotations were made from passages that were\nrendered differently by different translators, to use that translation\nwhich was found to be most correct and authentic.\n\u201c\u2018The finding of the various passages quoted from historians has\nbeen a laborious task, and the verification of the passages quoted has\nled to some changes in the wording of the text. This is especially [435]\nnoticeable in the quotations from the History Of The Reformation,\nBy J. Merle D\u2019Aubigne. It was found that there were six or more\nEnglish translations, American and British, which varied much in\nwording, although almost identical in thought; and in the old edition\nof Great Controversy three of these had been used, according to\nthe clearness and beauty of the language. But we learned that only\none of these many translations had the approval of the author; that\nis the one used by the American Tract Society in its later editions.\nTherefore the quotations from D\u2019Aubigne in this edition of Great\nControversy have been made to conform in the main to this approved\ntranslation.\n\u201c\u2018In a few instances, new quotations from historians, preachers,\nand present-day writers have been used in the place of the old,\nbecause they are more forceful or because we have been unable to\nfind the old ones. In each case where there has been such a change,\n388 Selected Messages Book 3\nmother has given faithful attention to the proposed substitution, and\nhas approved of the change.\n\u201c\u2018You will find that changes of this character have been made on\npages 273, 277, 306-308, 334, 335, 387, 547, 580, and 581.\n\u201c\u2018There are still some score or more quotations in the book\nwhose authority we have so far been unable to trace. Fortunately,\nthese relate to matters regarding which there is not a probability of\nthere being any serious contention.\n\u201c\u2018In spelling, punctuation, and capitalization, changes have been\nmade to bring this book into uniformity of style with the other\nvolumes of this series.\n\u201c\u2018In eight or ten places, time references have been changed\nbecause of the lapse of time since the book was first published.\n\u201c\u2018In several places, forms of expression have been changed\nto avoid giving unnecessary offense. An example of this will be\nfound in the change of the word \u201cRomish\u201d to \u201cRoman\u201d or \u201cRoman\nCatholic.\u201d In two places the phrase \u201cdivinity of Christ\u201d is changed\nto \u201cdeity of Christ.\u201d And the words \u201creligious toleration\u201d have been[436]\nchanged to \u201creligious liberty.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018The statements made on pages 285-287, regarding the action\nof the assembly, in its blasphemous decrees against religion and\nthe Bible, have been so worded as to show that the assembly set\naside, and afterward restored, not only the Bible but also God and\nHis worship.\n\u201c\u2018In the new edition, the rise of the papacy in 538, and its fall in\n1798, are spoken of as its \u201csupremacy\u201d and \u201cdownfall,\u201d instead of\nits \u201cestablishment\u201d and \u201cabolition,\u201d as in the old edition.\n\u201c\u2018In each of these places the more accurate form of expression\nhas been duly considered and approved by the author of the book.\n\u201c\u2018On pages 50, 563, 564, 580, 581, and in a few other places\nwhere there were statements regarding the papacy which are strongly\ndisputed by Roman Catholics, and which are difficult to prove from\naccessible histories, the wording in the new edition has been so\nchanged that the statement falls easily within the range of evidence\nthat is readily obtainable.\n\u201c\u2018Regarding these and similar passages, which might stir up\nbitter and unprofitable controversies, Mother has often said: \u201cWhat\nI have written regarding the arrogance and the assumptions of the\nAppendix A 389\npapacy is true. Much historical evidence regarding these matters\nhas been designedly destroyed; nevertheless, that the book may be\nof the greatest benefit to Catholics and others, and that needless\ncontroversies may be avoided, it is better to have all statements\nregarding the assumptions of the pope and the claims of the papacy\nstated so moderately as to be easily and clearly proved from accepted\nhistories that are within the reach of our ministers and students.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018If you hear reports that some of the work done on this latest\nedition was done contrary to Mother\u2019s wish or without her knowl-\nedge, you can be sure that such reports are false, and unworthy of\nconsideration.\u2019\u201d\nPassages from the old and the new editions were read and com- [437]\npared, to illustrate the statement read from the speaker\u2019s letter of\nJuly 24. Then Brother White said:\n\u201cSince the printing of this new edition, Mother has taken great\npleasure in looking over and rereading the book. Day after day, as I\nvisited her in the morning, she spoke of it, saying that she enjoyed\nreading it again, and that she was glad that the work we have done\nto make this edition as perfect as possible was completed while she\nwas living and could direct in what was done.\n\u201cMother has never claimed to be authority on history. The things\nwhich she has written out, are descriptions of flashlight pictures and\nother representations given her regarding the actions of men, and the\ninfluence of these actions upon the work of God for the salvation of\nmen, with views of past, present, and future history in its relation\nto this work. In connection with the writing out of these views, she\nhas made use of good and clear historical statements to help make\nplain to the reader the things which she is endeavoring to present.\nWhen I was a mere boy, I heard her read D\u2019Aubigne\u2019s History of\nThe Reformation to my father. She read to him a large part, if not\nthe whole, of the five volumes. She has read other histories of the\nreformation. This has helped her to locate and describe many of\nthe events and the movements presented to her in vision. This is\nsomewhat similar to the way in which the study of the Bible helps\nher to locate and describe the many figurative representations given\nto her regarding the development of the great controversy in our day\nbetween truth and error.\n390 Selected Messages Book 3\n\u201cMother has never laid claim to verbal inspiration, and I do not\nfind that my father, or Elder Bates, Andrews, Smith, or Waggoner,\nput forth this claim. If there were verbal inspiration in writing her\nmanuscripts, why should there be on her part the work of addi-\ntion or adaptation? It is a fact that Mother often takes one of her\nmanuscripts, and goes over it thoughtfully, making additions that\ndevelop the thought still further.\n\u201cThe first edition of this book was published in California in\n1884. When Spirit of Prophecy, V olume III was printed, there was[438]\nsome matter left over. A portion of this was printed in pamphlet\nform and circulated; and it was expected that mother would proceed\nimmediately to add to this matter and bring out V olume IV . Before\nfather\u2019s death he had advertised the book,Spirit of Prophecy, V olume",

      "text": "\u201cWhen mother brought out V olume IV , she and those who had to\ndo with its publication had in mind the fulfillment of father\u2019s plan.\nWe also had in mind that it was written for the Adventist people of\nthe United States. Therefore with much difficulty the matter was\ncompressed so as to bring this volume into about the same size as\nthe other volumes of the series.\n\u201cLater on, when it was found that the book could be sold to all\npeople, the publishers took the plates and printed an edition on larger\npaper. Illustrations were inserted, and an experiment made in selling\nit as a subscription book at $1.50.\n\u201cIn 1885 mother and I were sent to Europe, and there the question\ncame up regarding its translation into German, French, Danish, and\nSwedish. As mother considered this proposition, she decided to\nmake additions to the matter.\n\u201cMother\u2019s contact with European people had brought to her mind\nscores of things that had been presented to her in vision during past\nyears, some of them two or three times, and other scenes many\ntimes. Her seeing of historic places and her contact with the people\nrefreshed her memory with reference to these things, and so she\ndesired to add much material to the book. This was done, and the\nmanuscripts were prepared for translation.\n\u201cAfter our return to America, a new edition was brought out\nmuch enlarged. In this edition some of the matter used in the first\nEnglish edition was left out. The reason for these changes was\nAppendix A 391\nfound in the fact that the new edition was intended for worldwide\ncirculation.\n\u201cIn her public ministry, Mother has shown an ability to select\nfrom the storehouse of truth, matter that is well adapted to the needs [439]\nof the congregation before her; and she has always thought that, in\nthe selection of matter for publication in her books, the best judgment\nshould be shown in selecting that which is best suited to the needs\nof those who will read the book.\n\u201cTherefore, when the new edition of Great Controversy was\nbrought out in 1888, there were left out about twenty pages of\nmatter\u2014four or five pages in a place\u2014which was very instructive\nto the Adventists of America, but which was not appropriate for\nreaders in other parts of the world.\n\u201cMuch of the research for historical statements used in the new\nEuropean and American editions of Great Controversy was done\nin Basel, where we had access to Elder Andrews\u2019 large library, and\nwhere the translators had access to the university libraries.\n\u201cWhen we came to go over this matter for the purpose of giving\nhistorical references, there were some quotations which we could\nnot find. In some cases there were found other statements making the\nsame point, from other historians. These were in books accessible\nin many public libraries. When we brought to Mother\u2019s attention\na quotation that we could not find, and showed her that there was\nanother quotation that we had found, which made the same point,\nshe said, \u2018Use the one you can give reference to, so that the reader\nof the books, if he wishes to go to the source and find it, can do so.\u2019\nIn that way some historical data have been substituted.\n\u201cNow, with reference to the statement that the people at Wash-\nington, or the General Conference Committee men, have been doing\nthis or that, right or wrong, in connection with this book, it is im-\nportant that you should have a clear statement of facts regarding the\nmatter.\n\u201cOur brethren at Washington and at Mountain View have done\nonly that which we requested them to do. As stated in the begin-\nning, we took counsel with the men of the publishing department,\nwith State canvassing agents, and with members of the publishing\ncommittees, not only in Washington, but in California, and I asked [440]\n392 Selected Messages Book 3\nthem to kindly call our attention to any passages that needed to be\nconsidered in connection with the resetting of the book.\n\u201cWhen it was pointed out that some of the historical data were\nquestioned and challenged, we asked them to give us a written state-\nment that would help us in our research. They did as we requested\nand nothing more. All decisions as to what should be changed, and\nwhat should be printed word for word as in the old edition, were\nmade in Mother\u2019s office, by persons in her employ and working\nunder her direction. Therefore there is no occasion for any one to\nsay a word against the General Conference Committee men or the\nliterary men at Washington, or against the book, because of anything\ndone by the brethren in Washington or elsewhere in connection with\nthis work.\n\u201cWe are very thankful to our brethren in Washington, and to\nmany others, for kind and faithful painstaking labors in looking up\nthose passages that were likely to be challenged by the Catholics\nand other critics. We were also profoundly thankful to our brethren\nin England and on the continent, and also to brethren in Boston,\nNew York, and Chicago, for helping to find in the great libraries, and\nverify, those quotations that were difficult to locate. They have done\nthis work at our request, and to help us in what we thought ought to\nbe done. The uses made of the results of this research, are seen in\nthe historical references at the foot of the page and in the Appendix.\n\u201cThe Appendix in the old book, as you remember, was partly\nexplanatory, partly argumentative, and partly apologetic; but such\nnotes seemed to us to be no longer necessary, and the thirty-one notes\nin the new edition are chiefly references to historical statements\nshowing the correctness of the statements made in the book. We felt\nthat it would be of value to the studious reader to have these definite\nreferences to the statements of well-known historians.\u201d\nCopy of a Letter Written by Elder W. C. White:[441]\nSanitarium, Calif.,\nJuly 25, 1911\nTo the Members of the Publication Committee\nDear Brethren,\nAppendix A 393\nIn the accompanying letter to our State Missionary Agents, I\nhave made a brief statement about the changes that appear in the\nnew edition of Great Controversy.\nA study of these changes may lead some to ask the question,\n\u201cHas Sister White the authority and right to make changes in her pub-\nlished writings, either by addition, or by omission, or by any change\nwhatever in the forms of expression, the manner of description, or\nthe plan of the argument?\u201d\nThe simple statement of some facts regarding the writing of her\nbooks, and the enlargement and development of the story of the great\ncontroversy between Christ and Satan, may of itself constitute an\nanswer to this question.\nIt is generally admitted that in Sister White\u2019s discourses, spoken\nto the people, she uses great freedom and wisdom in the selection of\nproofs and illustrations, to make plain and forcible her presentation\nof the truths revealed to her in vision. Also, that she selects such\nfacts and arguments as are adapted to the audience to whom she is\nspeaking. This is essential to the attainment of the best results from\nher discourses.\nAnd she has always felt and taught that it was her duty to use the\nsame wisdom in the selection of matter for her books, that she does\nin the selection of matter for her discourses.\nWhen Mother was writing Great Controversy, V olume IV , in\n1882-1884, she was instructed regarding the general plan of the\nbook. It was revealed to her that she should present an outline of\nthe controversy between Christ and Satan as it developed in the first\ncenturies of the Christian Era, and in the great Reformation of the\nsixteenth century, in such a way as to prepare the mind of the reader [442]\nto understand clearly the controversy as it is going on in our day.\nWhile Mother was writing this book, many of the scenes were\npresented to her over and over again in visions of the night. The\nvision of the deliverance of God\u2019s people, as given in Chapter XL,\nwas repeated three times; and on two occasions, once at her home in\nHealdsburg and once at the St. Helena Sanitarium, members of her\nfamily, sleeping in nearby rooms, were awakened from sleep by her\nclear, musical cry, \u201cThey come! They come!\u201d (See page 636.)\nSeveral times we thought that the manuscript of the book was all\nready for the printer, and then a vision of some important feature of\n394 Selected Messages Book 3\nthe controversy would be repeated, and Mother would again write\nupon the subject, bringing out the description more fully and clearly.\nThus the publishing was delayed, and the book grew in size.\nMother regarded this new book as an expansion of the subject as\nfirst published in \u201cSpiritual Gifts,\u201d V olume I (1858), and now found\nin Early Writings, 210-295.\nAnd notwithstanding the divine instruction regarding the plan of\nthe book, which has made it so useful to the general public, Mother\nfelt that it was addressed chiefly to the Adventist people of the United\nStates. Later, in preparing it for a wider circulation, she omitted a\nfew portions that had appeared in the earlier edition. Examples of\nthese may be found in the chapter entitled, \u201cThe Snares of Satan,\u201d\nPages 518-530....\nIn her first visions the lives of the patriarchs, the mission and\nteachings of Christ and His apostles, and the controversy as carried\nforward by the church of Christ from the ascension to our day were\nat first presented to her in outline and were written out in brief,\ncomprehensive articles as we find them in Early Writings.\nIn later years, one group of subjects after another was shown her[443]\nin vision repeatedly, and each time the revelation brought out more\nclearly the details of the whole or of some features of the subject.\nConsequently Mother has written and published her views on\nthe various phases of the great controversy several times, and each\ntime more fully.\nThat which was published regarding the fall of Satan, the fall\nof man, and the plan of salvation, in Early Writings occupied eight\npages. The same subjects as published in Patriarchs and Prophets\noccupied thirty larger pages.\nThat which was published in 1858 about the life of Christ, as\nfound in Early Writings, occupied forty pages. The same as pub-\nlished in 1878 fills over six hundred pages of Spirit of Prophecy,\nV olumes II and III. And as now published inDesire Of Ages, and in\nChrist\u2019s Object Lessons, it fills more than a thousand pages.\nIn Great Controversy, V olume IV , published in 1885, in the\nchapter \u201cSnares of Satan,\u201d there are three pages or more of matter\nthat was not used in the later editions, which were prepared to be\nsold to the multitudes by our canvassers. It is most excellent and\ninteresting reading for Sabbathkeepers, as it points out the work that\nAppendix A 395\nSatan will do in persuading popular ministers and church members\nto elevate the Sunday Sabbath, and to persecute Sabbathkeepers.\n[Currently found in Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers,\n472-475.]\nIt was not left out because it was less true in 1888 than in 1885,\nbut because Mother thought it was not wisdom to say these things to\nthe multitudes to whom the book would be sold in future years....\nWith reference to this, and to other passages in her writings\nwhich have been omitted in later editions, she has often said: \u201cThese\nstatements are true, and they are useful to our people; but to the\ngeneral public, for whom this book is now being prepared, they are\nout of place. Christ said, even to his disciples, \u2018I have many things\nto say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.\u2019 And Christ taught his\ndisciples to be \u2018wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\u2019 Therefore, [444]\nas it is probable that more souls will be won to Christ by the book\nwithout this passage than with it, let it be omitted.\u201d [A Marian Davis\nstatement.\u2014Compilers.]\nRegarding changes in forms of expression, Mother has often said:\n\u201cEssential truths must be plainly told; but so far as possible they\nshould be told in language that will win, rather than offend.\u201d\u2014Letter,\nJuly 25, 1911.\nW. C. White.\nAppendix B[445]\nW. C. White statement made to W. W. Eastman, [Publishing\nDepartment Secretary, Southwestern Union Conference.]\nNovember 4, 1912.\nIt seems to me, Brother Eastman, that we must hold fast our\nconfidence in the great Adventist movement of 1844, and we should\nnot be easily moved from the positions held by the leaders in that\nmovement and by the pioneers of our own denomination.\nAt the same time, I believe we should encourage our editors,\nour ministers, and the teachers in our schools, and the rank and\nfile of our people, as far as they have time and opportunity, to be\nthorough Bible students and faithful students of history so that they\nmay know for themselves and so that they can prove to people who\ndo not accept our denominational books as authority, the points that\nwe hold as a people. It is my conviction that those who write for\nour denominational papers regarding prophecy and its fulfillment\nought to be encouraged to give deep and faithful study to the subjects\nabout which they write, and to use in their arguments references\nand quotations from those historians which will be accepted by the\nreaders as authority.\nIt may be all right for a preacher in presenting Biblical exposi-[446]\ntions to his congregations to quote from Daniel and Revelation and\nGreat Controversy as well expressed statement of his views; but it\ncould hardly be wise for him to quote from them as authoritative\nhistories to prove his points. I think you will discern the reasonable-\nness of this proposition. A Presbyterian who was endeavoring to\nprove the soundness of his theories to a congregation of Methodists\nwould not be expected to depend largely upon Presbyterian writers\nto prove his points, nor would a Methodist who was endeavoring to\nconvince a Baptist of the soundness of the Methodist religion, make\nthe greatest headway by using Methodist writers as his authority. In\nall our work we must study to follow methods that are most effective.\n396\nAppendix B 397\nWhen it comes to the matter of writing out expositions of doctrine\nor of prophecy, still greater care must be taken by the writer than\nby the preacher to select those authorities which will be accepted as\nauthorities by the critical and studious reader.\nIf I understand the matter correctly, Brother _____ has been\nwriting articles on prophecy and its fulfillment in which he uses\nDaniel and Revelation and Great Controversy as authority to prove\nhis points. This I should consider to be a very poor policy. Some\nreaders will accept it as establishing the truth. Some readers will\naccept it as true, while questioning the authority. With others the\nuse of these denominational books in such a way will constitute a\nchallenge for them to endeavor to prove that there are errors in the\nbooks thus used as authority. Will it not be better for all classes if\nin our sermons and articles, we prove our points by references to\nauthorities that are generally accepted?\nEllen G. White Writings on History\nRegarding Mother\u2019s writings and their use as authority on points\nof history and chronology, Mother has never wished our brethren to\ntreat them as authority regarding the details of history or historical\ndates. The great truths revealed to mother regarding the controversy\nbetween good and evil, light and darkness, have been given to her in [447]\nvarious ways, but chiefly as flashlight views of great events in the\nlives of individuals and in the experiences of churches, of bands of\nreformers, and of nations. What has thus been revealed to her she\nhas written out first briefly in the Early Writings, then more fully as\nin Spiritual Gifts and in Spirit of Prophecy, and finally in the Great\nControversy series.\nWhen writing out the experiences of Reformers in the time of\nthe Reformation and in the great Advent Movement of 1844, Mother\noften gave at first a partial description of some scene presented to her.\nLater on she would write it out more fully, and again still more fully.\nI have known her to write upon one subject four or five times, and\nthen mourn because she could not command language to describe\nthe matter more perfectly.\nWhen writing out the chapters for Great Controversy, she some-\ntimes gave a partial description of an important historical event, and\n398 Selected Messages Book 3\nwhen her copyist who was preparing the manuscripts for the printer,\nmade inquiry regarding time and place, Mother would say that those\nthings are recorded by conscientious historians. Let the dates used\nby those historians be inserted. At other times in writing out what\nhas been presented to her, Mother found such perfect descriptions of\nevents and presentations of facts and of doctrines written out in our\ndenominational books, that she copied the words of these authorities.\nWhen Controversy was written, Mother never thought that the\nreaders would take it as authority on historical dates or use it to settle\ncontroversy regarding details of history, and she does not now feel\nthat it should be used in that way. Mother regards with great respect\nthe work of those faithful historians who devoted years of time to\nthe study of God\u2019s great plan as presented in the prophecy, and the\noutworking of that plan as recorded in history.\nIn past years whenever definite proof has been found that the\nwriters of our Adventist literature had come short of finding the exact[448]\nproof regarding details, Mother has taken her position in favor of\ncorrecting those things that were clearly found to be in error. When\nshe was consulted about the efforts that were being made to revise\nand correct the good book Daniel and Revelation, she has always\nopposed making many changes, and has always favored correcting\nthose things that were plainly shown to be incorrect.\nChronology\nIt seems to me there is danger of placing altogether too much\nstress upon chronology. If it had been essential to the salvation of\nman that he should have a clear and harmonious understanding of\nthe chronology of the world, the Lord would not have permitted the\ndisagreements and discrepancies which we find in the writings of\nthe Bible historians, and it seems to me that in these last days there\nought not to be so much controversy regarding dates.\nFor myself, I will say this: That the more I study the experience\nof the Adventist people, the more I feel to honor and praise and\nmagnify the wisdom of the God of heaven who gave to a plain\nman like William Miller an understanding of the great truths of the\nprophecies. It is evident to anyone who will study his explanation of\nprophecy that while he had the truth regarding the principal features,\nAppendix B 399\nthat he adopted at first many inaccurate and incorrect interpretations\nregarding details. At first these were accepted by his associates; but\nGod raised up scholarly men who had enjoyed broader opportunities\nfor study than Miller, and these men by their study of the prophecies\nand history found the truth regarding many points in which Miller\u2019s\nexposition was incorrect.\nOne who studies this experience from the standpoint of faith in\nthat great Advent movement, as presented in Daniel and Revelation,\nand in Great Controversy, cannot fail to rejoice in the goodness\nof God as they see how He brought in truth and light through the\nstudy of many men and it seems to me that we who love the work\nthat was built upon that foundation ought to treat very kindly, very [449]\nconsiderately, very reverently the work which God helped Miller to\ndo.\nMake Only Modest Claims\nBut if we claim that Miller and his associates had a perfect and\ncomplete knowledge of the truth regarding the correspondence of\nhistory with prophecy, or if we claim for the pioneers in the third\nangel\u2019s message that their knowledge was complete and infallible,\nif we say, \u201cNever in the history of this cause have we been obliged\nto confess ourselves in error,\u201d we shall unwisely and unnecessarily\nchallenge criticism that will display to the world in a manifold and\nexaggerated light the imperfection and inaccuracies of some of our\nexpositions which have been corrected by the results of faithful study\nin later years.\nIt seems to me, Brother Eastman, that there is great possibil-\nity of our weakening our influence by closing our eyes to the fact\nthat we are all as little children learning from day to day from the\ngreat Teacher, and that it is our privilege to advance in knowledge\nand understanding. It seems to me that it is much wiser for us to\nconvince the world that God has been leading us, and that He is\nleading us by presenting from time to time, unanswerable evidences\nregarding the soundness of our position by a clear presentation of\nthe correspondence of prophecy and history through the use of his-\ntorical data which the world cannot question, than by any efforts\nthat we shall make to prove that the positions we held last year or\n400 Selected Messages Book 3\nten years ago or twenty years ago or thirty years ago were infallible\nand unchangeable.\nRegarding Mother\u2019s writings, I have overwhelming evidence\nand conviction that they are the description and delineation of what\nGod has revealed to her in vision, and where she has followed the\ndescription of historians or the exposition of Adventist writers, I\nbelieve that God has given her discernment to use that which is\ncorrect and in harmony with truth regarding all matters essential to[450]\nsalvation. If it should be found by faithful study that she has followed\nsome expositions of prophecy which in some detail regarding dates\nwe cannot harmonize with our understanding of secular history, it\ndoes not influence my confidence in her writings as a whole any\nmore than my confidence in the Bible is influenced by the fact that I\ncannot harmonize many of the statements regarding chronology.\nAppendix C [451]\nW. C. White letter to L. E. Froom, [At that time Elder Froom\nwas an associate secretary of the General Conference\nMinisterial Association.] January 8, 1928\nJanuary 8, 1928\nDear Brother Froom,\nYesterday\u2019s mail brought me your letter of January 3. In it you\npresent some queries calling for a reply from me.\nYou refer to a memory of a conversation with me in which you\nthink I remarked that Mother said with reference to some of her\nwritings, \u201cMy work is to prepare; your work is to shape it up.\u201d\nI do not remember of ever hearing Mother make such a statement,\nand I do not think that any of her helpers ever heard her make such\na statement. The thought which would prompt such a statement is\nnot in harmony with her ideas regarding her work and the work of\nher copyists and secretaries.\nThere is a statement which I have made to several of our leading\nworkers from which the idea conveyed in your query may have de-\nveloped. I have told them that in the early days of our work, Mother\nhad written a testimony to an individual or to a group, containing\ninformation and counsel that would be valuable to others, and the\nbrethren were questioning her as to how it ought to be used. She [452]\nsaid to my father often and sometimes to him and his associates\u2014\u201cI\nhave done my part. I have written out what the Lord has revealed to\nme. Now it is for you to say how it shall be used.\u201d\nYou will readily see that such a proposition was very reasonable.\nMy father and his associates were in contact with all the problems\npertaining to the cause of present truth, which has since developed\ninto the work of the General Conference, and it was a wise provision\nof heaven that they should share in the responsibility of saying how\nand in what manner the messages should be placed before whom\nthey were intended to benefit.\n401\n402 Selected Messages Book 3\nYou seem to think that if there was such a statement as referred\nto in your letter, it would be a benefit to some of our brethren. I\ncannot comprehend how it would benefit them. Possibly you can\nmake it plain to me.\nRegarding the two paragraphs which are to be found in Spiritual\nGifts and also in the Spirit of Prophecy regarding amalgamation and\nthe reason why they were left out of the later books, and the question\nas to who took the responsibility of leaving them out, I can speak\nwith perfect clearness and assurance. They were left out by Ellen\nG. White. No one connected with her work had any authority over\nsuch a question, and I never heard of anyone offering to her counsel\nregarding this matter.\nIn all questions of this kind, you may set it down as a certainty\nthat Sister White was responsible for leaving out or adding to matters\nof this sort in the later editions of our books.\nSister White not only had good judgment based upon a clear\nand comprehensive understanding of conditions and of the natural\nconsequences of publishing what she wrote, but she had many times\ndirect instruction from the angel of the Lord regarding what should\nbe omitted and what should be added in new editions....\nConsider for a few moments the chapter in the first edition of\nGreat Controversy, V olume IV , published by Pacific Press in 1884.\nIn Chapter XXVII, \u201cThe Snares of Satan,\u201d you find that about four\npages in the latter part of the chapter were omitted from the later[453]\neditions of Great Controversy. These four pages are to be found in\nTestimonies to Ministers, pages 472 to 475. The information con-\ntained in these four pages is very valuable to Seventh-day Adventists\nand was very appropriately included in the first edition of Great\nControversy, V olume IV , which when it was published was like the\nother volumes considered to be a message especially to Seventh-day\nAdventists, and to [all] Christian people sympathizing with them in\nbeliefs and aims.\nBut when it was decided that Great Controversy, V olume IV\nshould be republished in form for general circulation by subscrip-\ntion agents, Ellen G. White suggested that the pages be left out\nbecause of the likelihood that ministers of popular churches reading\nthose statements would become angered and would array themselves\nagainst the circulation of the book.\nAppendix C 403\nWhy will not our brethren study God\u2019s merciful dealings to us by\nimparting information to us by the Spirit of Prophecy in its beautiful,\nharmonious, and helpful features, instead of picking and criticizing\nand dissecting, trying to cut it up into little mechanical concrete\nblocks such as we buy for our children to play with and then ask\nsomebody else to fit it together so that it will make a pattern that\npleases them and leave out the particular parts of the pattern that\nthey do not like? I pray the Lord to give us patience and guidance\nin doing what we can to help such ones to see the beauty of God\u2019s\nwork.\nYou refer to other letters containing questions which I have not\nanswered. I hope to get at them soon, but not this morning.\nYours faithfully,\nW. C. White\nW. C. White letter to L. E. Froom\nJanuary 8, 1928\nDear Brother Froom,\nSince sending away a letter to you yesterday I have found yours [454]\nof December 22. In it you tell me that for two full years you have\nbeen encouraging Elder Daniells to prepare a book on the Spirit of\nProphecy, but you failed to tell me what response he gives to these\nrequests.\nReferring to the statements that have been published by Elder\nLoughborough, you speak of the stress placed upon him by the\nphysical manifestations and intimate that these do not appeal to you.\nI fully agree with you that the great proof of the divine hand\nin the gift to the remnant church is in the internal evidence of the\nwritings themselves. Nevertheless, I must believe that in the physical\nmanifestations which have accompanied the bestowal of light and\nrevelation, there is some real value; otherwise God would not have\ngiven them. Furthermore I am brought in contact with a great many\npeople, earnest, sincere, and precious in the sight of the Lord, who\ndo regard these physical manifestations as a matter of serious impor-\ntance, and they testify that their faith has been greatly strengthened\n404 Selected Messages Book 3\nby a clear knowledge of the methods adopted by our heavenly father\nfor the confirmation of the receivers in the light He has given them.\nYou refer to the little statement which I sent you regarding verbal\ninspiration. This statement made by the General Conference of 1883\nwas in perfect harmony with the beliefs and positions of the pioneers\nin this cause, and it was, I think, the only position taken by any of\nour ministers and teachers until Prof. [W. W.] Prescott, president\nof Battle Creek College, presented in a very forceful way another\nview\u2014the view held and presented by Professor Gausen. [Probably\nFrancois Gaussen, a Swiss clergyman (1790-1863), who maintained\nthat the Bible was verbally inspired.] The acceptance of that view by\nthe students in the Battle Creek College and many others, including\nElder Haskell, has resulted in bringing into our work questions and\nperplexities without end, and always increasing.\nSister White never accepted the Gausen theory regarding verbal[455]\ninspiration, either as applied to her own work or as applied to the\nBible.\nYou say that in your endeavor to have a loyal and rational under-\nstanding of the background of this marvelous gift, you have been\nseeking to gain information concerning the various persons who\nhelped Sister White in the literary phase of the work.\nIt is my conviction, Brother Froom, that you will never get light\nregarding the background of the gift of the Spirit of Prophecy by\nstudying the characteristics and qualifications of the faithful copyist\nand the copy editors, whom Sister White called to her assistance in\npreparing for publication articles for our periodical and chapters for\nher books.\nThe foundation by which to fix faith in the messages which God\nhas sent to His people, will be more readily found in the study of His\ndealings with His prophets in past ages. It seems to me that the study\nof the life and labors and writings of Saint Paul are more helpful and\nilluminating than any other line of study we might suggest, and I do\nnot think we shall be greatly helped in establishing confidence in\nthe writings of Paul by searching to make a list of his helpers and\nby study into their history and their experience. It is easy for me to\nbelieve that Jeremiah was directed of God in his selection of Baruch\nas a copyist; also that Paul had heavenly wisdom in selecting those\nAppendix C 405\nwho should act as his amanuensis from time to time according to his\nneeds.\nIt is my belief that Sister Ellen G. White had heavenly guidance\nin choosing the persons who should act as copyists and those who\nshould help to prepare articles for our periodicals and chapters for\nour books.\nI am well acquainted with the circumstances which led her to\nselect some of these workers and of the direct encouragements given\nher regarding their qualifications and trustworthiness for the work. I\nalso know of instances where she was directed to instruct, to caution,\nand sometimes to dismiss from her employ those whose lack of\nspirituality disqualified them for satisfactory service. Regarding this, [456]\nElder Starr could give you an interesting chapter regarding Sister\nWhite\u2019s experience with Miss Fannie Bolton, and I could tell you of\na circumstance under which she was separated from her own niece,\nMary Clough, whom she greatly loved.\nIn the early \u201860\u2019s, Sister White was unaided, except by her hus-\nband, who would listen to her as she read chapters of manuscript and\nwould suggest grammatical corrections as they occurred to his mind.\nAs a little boy I remember witnessing circumstances like this\u2014Elder\nWhite in his weariness would be lying on the sofa and sister White\nwould bring in a chapter written forSpiritual Gifts and would read to\nhim and he would suggest, as stated above, grammatical corrections.\nArticles for the Testimonies were treated in a similar way.\nBeside the few testimonies which were printed, many personal\ntestimonies were sent to individuals and oftentimes Sister White\nwould write saying, \u201cI have no one to copy this testimony. Please\nmake a copy for yourself and send the original back to me.\u201d As a\nresult of this method of work, we have in our manuscript vault many\nof the early testimonies in Sister White\u2019s handwriting.\nIn the earlier \u201860\u2019s, Sister Lucinda M. Hall acted as sister White\u2019s\nhousekeeper, secretary, and sometimes traveling companion. She\nwas both timid and conscientious, and only the plainest grammatical\nerrors were corrected by her. About 1862, Sister Adelia Patten\nconnected with the White family and did some copying for Sister\nWhite. Later on she connected with the Review and Herald.\nIn the Autumn of 1872 Sister White visited Colorado and became\nacquainted with her niece Mary C. Clough, and in \u201874, \u201875 and\n406 Selected Messages Book 3\n\u201876 Miss Clough assisted in preparing copy for Spirit of Prophecy,\nV olumes II and III. She also accompanied Elder and Mrs. White in\ntheir camp-meeting labors and acted as reporter for the public press.\nIn so doing, she was the first publicity agent regularly employed by\nthe denomination and may be looked up to as the grandmother of[457]\nour publicity department.\nHer experience as a newspaper reporter, the confidence that she\nthus gained and the praise that was heaped upon her work, unfitted\nher for the delicate and sacred work of being copy editor for Review\narticles and the chapters for the Great Controversy. In a vision it\nwas presented to Sister White that she and Mary were looking at\nsome wondrous developments in the sky. They meant much to Sister\nWhite, but to Mary they seemed to mean nothing; and the angel said,\n\u201cSpiritual things are spiritually discerned,\u201d and then instructed Sister\nWhite that she should no longer employ her niece as her book editor.\nDuring \u201868, \u201869, and \u201870, various ones were employed by Sister\nWhite to copy her testimonies. Among them were miss Emma\nSturgess, afterward the wife of Amos Prescott; Miss Anna Hale,\nafterward the wife of Irwin Royce; and others, whose names I do\nnot now remember.\nAfter the death of Elder [James] White in 1881, Sister White\nemployed Sister Marian Davis. She had been for some years a proof-\nreader in the Review and Herald, and Sister White received assurance\nthrough revelation that Sister Davis would be a conscientious and\nfaithful helper. Later on Sister Eliza Burnham was employed by\nSister White, and at one time Mrs. B. L. Whitney and Fannie Bolton\nwere employed at Battle Creek as helpers when there was much\nwork to do. Sister Davis was with Sister White in Europe in 1886\nand 1887. She was also Sister White\u2019s principal helper in Australia.\nAs the work in Australia grew, Sister Burnham was called to\nassist in the book editing, and Maggie Hare and Minnie Hawkins\nwere employed as copyists.\nI had forgotten to mention that during the years when Sister\nWhite was in Healdsburg, Sister J. I. Ings did much copying of\ntestimonies and of manuscripts.\nAt one time, while we were in Australia, it was proposed that the\nSpecial Testimonies to Ministers(I.E., Special Testimonies, Series A)[458]\npublished and sent out by Elder [O. A.] Olsen [General Conference\nAppendix C 407\npresident.] in the early \u201890\u2019s should be reprinted\u2014the matter to be\ngrouped according to subjects. While this was under consideration,\nit happened that Elder W. A. Colcord, who had once been secretary\nof the General Conference and for many years a leading writer on\nreligious liberty topics, was out of employment, and at my solicita-\ntions Sister White employed him to take the special testimonies and\ngroup the matter according to subjects for republication. He spent\nseveral weeks on this work and was paid by Sister White; but the\nwork was never used. If I remember correctly, this was the extent of\nhis connection with her literary work.\nThe last work done by Sister Davis was the selection and ar-\nrangement of the matter used in Ministry of Healing.\nElder C. C. Crisler assisted Sister White in selecting and arrang-\ning the matter appearing in Acts of the Apostles and Prophets and\nKings.\nThis sketch of the work and the workers does not claim to be\ncomplete. It was never considered by me or by any of Sister White\u2019s\nhelpers that the personnel of her working force was of any primary\ninterest to the readers of her books. She wrote the matter. She\nwrote very fully. There was always a controversy between her and\nthe publishers regarding the quantity of matter that should be used.\nSister White was best pleased when a subject was presented very\nfully, and the publishers were always bringing pressure to bear to\nhave the matter condensed or abbreviated so that the book would not\nbe too large. Consequently, after important chapters were prepared\nfor the printer, and sometimes after they were sent to the printer, a\nnew presentation of the subject would be given Sister White, and she\nwould write additional matter and insist upon its being incorporated.\nThis experience applied chiefly to the Great Controversy, V ol. IV.\nA corresponding difficulty regarding the amount of matter pre- [459]\npared for Desire of Ages was overcome in part by the setting apart of\nportions which were used in Christ\u2019s Object Lessons and Thoughts\nFrom the Mount of Blessing.\nRegarding the reading of works of contemporary authors during\nthe time of the preparation of these books, there is very little to be\nsaid, because, when Sister White was busily engaged in writing she\nhad very little time to read. Previous to her work of writing on the\nlife of Christ and during the time of her writing, to some extent, she\n408 Selected Messages Book 3\nread from the works of Hanna, Fleetwood, Farrar, and Geikie. I\nnever knew of her reading Edersheim. She occasionally referred to\nAndrews, particularly with reference to chronology.\nWhy did she read any of these books? The great events of the\nconflict of the ages as brought out in the Great Controversy [i.e.,\nConflict] Series, were presented to her in part at many different times.\nIn the first presentation a brief outline was given her as represented\nin the third section of the book now called Early Writings.\nLater on the great events of the patriarchal age and the experience\nof the prophets were presented to her as brought out in her articles\nin Testimonies for the Church, and in her series of articles published\nin later years in the Review, The Signs of the Times, and the Southern\nWatchman. These series, you will remember, deal quite fully with\nthe work of Ezra, Nehemiah, Jeremiah, and other of the prophets.\nThe great events occurring in the life of our Lord were presented\nto her in panoramic scenes as also were the other portions of the\nGreat Controversy. In a few of these scenes chronology and geogra-\nphy were clearly presented, but in the greater part of the revelation\nthe flashlight scenes, which were exceedingly vivid, and the con-\nversations and the controversies, which she heard and was able to\nnarrate, were not marked geographically or chronologically, and\nshe was left to study the Bible and history, and the writings of men\nwho had presented the life of our Lord to get the chronological and[460]\ngeographical connection.\nAnother purpose served by the reading of history and the Life\nof Our Lord [This may refer to William Hanna\u2019s Life of Our Lord\n(1863).] And the Life of St. Paul , was that in so doing there was\nbrought vividly to her mind scenes presented clearly in vision, but\nwhich were through the lapse of years and her strenuous ministry,\ndimmed in her memory.\nMany times in the reading of Hanna, Farrar, or Fleetwood, she\nwould run on to a description of a scene which had been vividly\npresented to her, but forgotten, and which she was able to describe\nmore in detail than that which she had read.\nNotwithstanding all the power that God had given her to present\nscenes in the lives of Christ and His apostles and His prophets\nand His reformers in a stronger and more telling way than other\nhistorians, yet she always felt most keenly the results of her lack of\nAppendix C 409\nschool education. She admired the language in which other writers\nhad presented to their readers the scenes which God had presented\nto her in vision, and she found it both a pleasure, and a convenience\nand an economy of time to use their language fully or in part in\npresenting those things which she knew through revelation, and\nwhich she wished to pass on to her readers.\nIn many of her manuscripts as they come from her hand quotation\nmarks are used. In other cases they were not used; and her habit of\nusing parts of sentences found in the writings of others and filling in\na part of her own composition, was not based upon any definite plan\nnor was it questioned by her copyists and copy writers until about\n1885 and onward.\nWhen critics pointed out this feature of her work as a reason\nfor questioning the gift which had enabled her to write, she paid\nlittle attention to it. Later on, when complaint was made that this\nwas an injustice to other publishers and writers, she made a decided\nchange\u2014a change which you are familiar with. [461]\nIt is my belief, Brother Froom, that I cannot too frequently restate\nthe fact that Sister White\u2019s mind was keenly active with reference\nto the contents of the articles published in our periodicals, and the\nchapters composing her books, and that she had help from heaven\nand was remarkably acute in detecting any error made by copyists or\nby copy editors. This condition prevailed during all her busy years\nbefore the death of her husband and after the death of her husband,\nduring her ministry in Europe and Australia and in the greater part\nof the years spent in America after her return from Australia.\nIn her very last years her supervision was not so comprehensive,\nbut she was marvelously blessed in her intelligence in directing re-\ngarding the matter previously written which was being used in her\nlast years and in pointing out those subjects which needed to be em-\nphasized and those subjects which could be spared as we proceeded\nwith the work of abridgment of the larger books in preparing copy\nfor translation into foreign tongues.\nPlease read this statement to Elder Daniells, and if you observe\nthat in my haste I have left matter so that it can be easily misun-\nderstood, please point this out to me and give me an opportunity to\nstrengthen the matter before it is placed by you before others of your\nbrethren.\n410 Selected Messages Book 3\nYours truly,\nW. C. White\nW. C. White Letter to L. E. Froom\n[At this time secretary of the General Conference Ministerial\nAssociation.]\nDecember 13, 1934\nDear Brother Froom,\nI hold in my hand your letter of December 3. The questions you\nask are very comprehensive and rather difficult to answer.\nIt is a fact that during my thirty or more years of association with[462]\nEllen White I had the utmost confidence in her ministry. I know\nthat she received revelations from God which were of untold value\nto the church and to the world. I did not enter as fully as some of\nour brethren wish to do in an analysis of the sources of information\nwhich enabled her to write her books.\nThe framework of the great temple of truth sustained by her\nwritings was presented to her clearly in vision. In some features of\nthis work, information was given in detail. Regarding some features\nof the revelation, such as the features of prophetic chronology, as\nregards the ministration in the sanctuary and the changes that took\nplace in 1844, the matter was presented to her many times and in\ndetail many times, and this enabled her to speak very clearly and\nvery positively regarding the foundation pillars of our faith.\nIn some of the historical matters such as are brought out in\nPatriarchs and Prophetsand in Acts of the Apostles, and in Great\nControversy, the main outlines were made very clear and plain to\nher, and when she came to write up these topics, she was left to\nstudy the Bible and history to get dates and geographical relations\nand to perfect her description of details.\nEllen White was a rapid reader and had a very retentive memory.\nThe revelations which she had received enabled her to grip subjects\nregarding which she read in a vigorous way. This enabled her to\nselect and appropriate that which was true and to discard that which\nwas erroneous or doubtful.\nAppendix C 411\nShe read diligently the History of the Reformation of the Six-\nteenth Century. Much of D\u2019Aubigne\u2019s history she read aloud to\nmy father. She was an interested reader of religious journals, and\nduring the many years that Uriah Smith was editor of the Review,\nIt was her custom to request him after having made use of the re-\nligious exchanges, to pass them over to her and she would spend\na portion of her time in scanning them in selecting precious things\nwhich sometimes appeared in the Review. In these she also gathered [463]\ninformation regarding what was going on in the religious world.\nRegarding the study of books, there came a time shortly after the\nerection of the brick edifice which housed the Review and Herald\nplant that the large room facing the north end on the second floor was\nassigned to Elder and Mrs. White as their editorial and writing room.\nIn this was located the Review and Herald library. To this Elder\nWhite made reference in his writings, and from the library Ellen\nWhite made selection of books which she considered profitable to\nread.\nIt was remarkable that in her reading and scanning of books that\nher mind was directed to the most helpful books and to the most\nhelpful passages contained in those books. Occasionally she would\nmention to Father, and in my presence, her experience in being led\nto examine a book which she had never looked into before, and\nher experience in opening it to certain passages that helped her in\ndescribing that which she had seen and wished to present.\nI am supposing that Bliss\u2019s Memoirs was in this library, but I\nhave no knowledge as to whether she read it or not. I never heard\nher mention that book in connection with her work.\nThe explanatory notes found in her large subscription books\nwere, some of them, written by herself, but most of them were\nwritten by J. H. Waggoner, Uriah Smith, and M. C. Wilcox in\nconjunction with Marian Davis.\nYou ask if James White brought to Ellen White books, the read-\ning of which would help her in her writing. I do not remember of\nany such occurrence. I do remember that she occasionally brought\ninteresting passages which she had been reading to the attention of\nher husband.\nYou ask if her helpers brought statements to her attention which\nthey thought would help her in her writings. Nothing of this kind\n412 Selected Messages Book 3\noccurred previous to the writing of Great Controversy, V olume IV ,\nat Healdsburg, in 1883 or 1884. Then it was seldom and related to[464]\nminor details.\nWhen we were in Basel, in 1886, we had a very interesting\nexperience with a group of translators. We found that our brethren\nin Europe were very desirous of having Great Controversy, V olume\nIV , translated in the French and German languages....\nTo provide this book for the French people, Elder Au Franc had\nbeen employed as translator and had put twenty or more chapters\ninto what he considered his first-class French. Not everyone was\nsatisfied with his translation and Elder Jean Vuilleumier had been\nemployed to make a translation and had gotten through with a half\ndozen more chapters.\nRegarding the German, there were three attempts at translation.\nProfessor Kuhns, Madam Bach, and Henry Fry were the translators.\nWhat should we do? Several persons were united in condemning\neach of these translations and it was difficult to find more than two\npersons who would speak a good word for either one.\nElder Whitney, manager of the Basel office, recognized the fact\nthat Sister White\u2019s writing was difficult. The figures of speech were\nin some cases imperfectly understood by the translators, and in some\ncases where they were understood the translators did not know the\nreligious phraseology of their own language well enough to give a\ncorrect translation.\nFinally a way was arranged. Each morning at nine o\u2019clock,\ntwo of the German translators, two of the French translators, Elder\nWhitney, Sister Davis, and myself met in the editorial room and\nchapter by chapter of the English book was read and commented\nupon. The translators recognizing a difficult passage, would stop the\nreading and discuss between themselves what the wording should\nbe in French and in German. Frequently Elder Whitney would stop\nthe reading and say, \u201cJohn, how would you translate that?\u201d Then he\nwould appeal to Elder au Franc saying, \u201cDo you agree with that?\u201d\nDiscerning that they did not understand in completeness the English[465]\ntext, Sister Davis and Brother Whitney would discuss its meaning\nand then the translators would again propose translation.\nWhen we reached those chapters relating to the Reformation in\nGermany and France, the translators would comment on the appro-\nAppendix C 413\npriateness of the selection of historical events which Sister White\nhad chosen, and in two instances which I remember, they suggested\nthat there were other events of corresponding importance which she\nhad not mentioned. When this was brought to her attention, she\nrequested that the histories be brought to her that she might consider\nthe importance of the events which had been mentioned. The reading\nof the history refreshed to her mind that which she had seen, after\nwhich she wrote a description of the event.\nI was with Mother when we visited Zurich and I well remember\nhow thoroughly her mind was aroused by seeing the old cathedral\nand the marketplace, and she spoke of them as they were in the days\nof Zwingle.\nDuring her two years\u2019 residence in Basel, she visited many places\nwhere events of special importance occurred in the Reformation\ndays. This refreshed her memory as to what she had been shown\nand this led to important enlargement in those portions of the book\ndealing with the Reformation days....\nWith very kind regards, I remain,\nSincerely your brother,\nW. C. White",
