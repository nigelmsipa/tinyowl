White left the care of her\nwritings to five church leaders, whom she named, appointing them\nas a self-perpetuating board of trustees of her literary estate. One of\nthe duties assigned to this board was \u201cThe Printing of Compilations\nfrom My Manuscripts.\u201d Beginning in the 1920s, many compilations\nwere produced, giving inspired counsel on single topics such as\nhealth, gospel work, stewardship, or home life.\nThe three volumes of the Selected Messages series depart from\nthis pattern. These books resemble the Testimonies for the Churchin\nthat they include writings on a variety of topics, such as how inspira-\ntion works, revival and reformation, and the danger of speculations,\nextreme views, and time-setting. They also contain instruction on\nhealthful living, the use of drugs and remedial agencies, preparing\nfor last-day events, and other practical topics on how to honor God\nin all aspects of daily life.\nMore than half of the present volume focuses directly on Je-\nsus, emphasizing the fact that he is the true center of all doctrine,\nteaching, and experience. Topics covered include the incarnation,\nthe temptation of Christ, Christ as creator and life-giver, Christ our\ndivine sin-bearer, and Christ our righteousness.\nThe sources from which these counsels were drawn include pe-\nriodical articles, out-of-print pamphlets and tracts, the Notebook\nLeaflets series, and Mrs. White\u2019s letters and manuscripts. As orig-\ninally written, the selections were not related to each other, but in\nthis and the other two volumes of Selected Messages they have been\nbrought together for easy access and balanced presentation. Within\nthe limitations of space, the compilers have endeavored to include\nas much context as would be relevant and helpful.\nThis volume was compiled in the offices of the White Estate by\nits staff under the direction of the board of trustees of the Ellen G.\nWhite estate. Introductory statements that appear at the beginning\nof each section give background on the subjects introduced, and are\nvii\nviii Selected Messages Book 1\nsigned by this board. Explanatory notes, approved by the trustees,\nare signed \u201cCompilers.\u201d\nThat this volume may help the church accomplish its God-as-\nsigned task is the sincere prayer and desire of the publishers and\nThe board of trustees of the Ellen G. White estate\nSection 1\u2014The Light on Our Pathway [14]\nIntroduction\nStatements penned by Ellen G. White, regarding her work as the\nmessenger of the Lord and concerning the processes by which God\ncommunicates his will to members of the human family, are always\nhelpful and interesting. Such are presented in this opening section\nof Selected Messages.\nAlthough the question of inspiration was touched on at intervals\nthrough her seventy years of ministry, the outstanding presentation\nis the author\u2019s introduction to The Great Controversy (not appearing\nhere) written in May, 1888. An earlier statement, \u201cObjections to\nthe Bible,\u201d penned in 1886, is published herein, and another, \u201cThe\nInspiration of the Word of God,\u201d written in the autumn of 1888, is\nalso presented here. A fourth major statement, \u201cThe mysteries of\nthe Bible a proof of its inspiration,\u201d was published in 1889 and may\nbe found in Testimonies for the Church 5:698-711.\nVarious explanations about her work, the republication of the\n1913 tract \u201cThe writing and sending out of the testimonies to the\nchurch,\u201d and Mrs. White\u2019s answers to certain questions and charges\nconcerning her earlier writings round out the section devoted to \u201cThe\nLight on Our Pathway.\u201d\nWhite Trustees.\n10\nChapter 1\u2014The Inspiration of the Prophetic [15]\nWriters\nThe Inspiration of the Word of God\nThis is a time when the question with all propriety may be asked,\n\u201cWhen the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\u201d\n(Luke 18:8).\nSpiritual darkness has covered the earth and gross darkness the\npeople. There are in many churches skepticism and infidelity in the\ninterpretation of the Scriptures. Many, very many, are questioning\nthe verity and truth of the Scriptures. Human reasoning and the\nimaginings of the human heart are undermining the inspiration of\nthe Word of God, and that which should be received as granted, is\nsurrounded with a cloud of mysticism. Nothing stands out in clear\nand distinct lines, upon rock bottom. This is one of the marked signs\nof the last days.\nThis Holy Book has withstood the assaults of Satan, who has\nunited with evil men to make everything of divine character shrouded\nin clouds and darkness. But the Lord has preserved this Holy Book\nby His own miraculous power in its present shape\u2014a chart or guide-\nbook to the human family to show them the way to heaven.\nBut the oracles of God have been so manifestly neglected that\nthere are but few in our world, even of those who profess to explain it [16]\nto others, who have the divine knowledge of the Scriptures. There are\nlearned men who have a college education, but these shepherds do\nnot feed the flock of God. They do not consider that the excellencies\nof the Scriptures will be continually unfolding their hidden treasures\nas precious jewels are discovered by digging for them.\nThere are men who strive to be original, who are wise above what\nis written; therefore, their wisdom is foolishness. They discover\nwonderful things in advance, ideas which reveal that they are far\nbehind in the comprehension of the divine will and purposes of\nGod. In seeking to make plain or to unravel mysteries hid from ages\n11\n12 Selected Messages Book 1\nfrom mortal man, they are like a man floundering about in the mud,\nunable to extricate himself and yet telling others how to get out of\nthe muddy sea they themselves are in. This is a fit representation of\nthe men who set themselves to correct the errors of the Bible. No\nman can improve the Bible by suggesting what the Lord meant to\nsay or ought to have said.\nSome look to us gravely and say, \u201cDon\u2019t you think there might\nhave been some mistake in the copyist or in the translators?\u201d This is\nall probable, and the mind that is so narrow that it will hesitate and\nstumble over this possibility or probability would be just as ready\nto stumble over the mysteries of the Inspired Word, because their\nfeeble minds cannot see through the purposes of God. Yes, they\nwould just as easily stumble over plain facts that the common mind\nwill accept, and discern the Divine, and to which God\u2019s utterance\nis plain and beautiful, full of marrow and fatness. All the mistakes\nwill not cause trouble to one soul, or cause any feet to stumble, that\nwould not manufacture difficulties from the plainest revealed truth.\nGod committed the preparation of His divinely inspired Word\nto finite man. This Word, arranged into books, the Old and New\nTestaments, is the guidebook to the inhabitants of a fallen world,\nbequeathed to them that, by studying and obeying the directions, not\none soul would lose its way to heaven.\nThose who think to make the supposed difficulties of Scripture[17]\nplain, in measuring by their finite rule that which is inspired and that\nwhich is not inspired, had better cover their faces, as Elijah when the\nstill small voice spoke to him; for they are in the presence of God\nand holy angels, who for ages have communicated to men light and\nknowledge, telling them what to do and what not to do, unfolding\nbefore them scenes of thrilling interest, waymark by waymark in\nsymbols and signs and illustrations.\nAnd He [God] has not, while presenting the perils clustering\nabout the last days, qualified any finite man to unravel hidden myster-\nies or inspired one man or any class of men to pronounce judgment\nas to that which is inspired or is not. When men, in their finite\njudgment, find it necessary to go into an examination of scriptures to\ndefine that which is inspired and that which is not, they have stepped\nbefore Jesus to show Him a better way than He has led us.\nInspiration of the Prophetic Writers 13\nI take the Bible just as it is, as the Inspired Word. I believe\nits utterances in an entire Bible. Men arise who think they find\nsomething to criticize in God\u2019s Word. They lay it bare before others\nas evidence of superior wisdom. These men are, many of them,\nsmart men, learned men, they have eloquence and talent, the whole\nlifework [of whom] is to unsettle minds in regard to the inspiration\nof the Scriptures. They influence many to see as they do. And the\nsame work is passed on from one to another, just as Satan designed it\nshould be, until we may see the full meaning of the words of Christ,\n\u201cWhen the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\u201d\n(Luke 18:8).\nBrethren, let not a mind or hand be engaged in criticizing the\nBible. It is a work that Satan delights to have any of you do, but it is\nnot a work the Lord has pointed out for you to do.\nMen should let God take care of His own Book, His living\noracles, as He has done for ages. They begin to question some parts\nof revelation, and pick flaws in the apparent inconsistencies of this\nstatement and that statement. Beginning at Genesis, they give up [18]\nthat which they deem questionable, and their minds lead on, for\nSatan will lead to any length they may follow in their criticism, and\nthey see something to doubt in the whole Scriptures. Their faculties\nof criticism become sharpened by exercise, and they can rest on\nnothing with a certainty. You try to reason with these men, but your\ntime is lost. They will exercise their power of ridicule even upon the\nBible. They even become mockers, and they would be astonished if\nyou put it to them in that light.\nBrethren, cling to your Bible, as it reads, and stop your criticisms\nin regard to its validity, and obey the Word, and not one of you will\nbe lost. The ingenuity of men has been exercised for ages to measure\nthe Word of God by their finite minds and limited comprehension.\nIf the Lord, the Author of the living oracles, would throw back the\ncurtain and reveal His wisdom and His glory before them, they\nwould shrink into nothingness and exclaim as did Isaiah, \u201cI am a\nman of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of people of unclean\nlips\u201d (Isaiah 6:5).\nSimplicity and plain utterance are comprehended by the illiterate,\nby the peasant, and the child as well as by the full-grown man or\nthe giant in intellect. If the individual is possessed of large talents\n14 Selected Messages Book 1\nof mental powers, he will find in the oracles of God treasures of\ntruth, beautiful and valuable, which he can appropriate. He will also\nfind difficulties, and secrets and wonders which will give him the\nhighest satisfaction to study during a long lifetime, and yet there is\nan infinity beyond.\nMen of humble acquirements, possessing but limited capabilities\nand opportunities to become conversant in the Scriptures, find in the\nliving oracles comfort, guidance, counsel, and the plan of salvation\nas clear as a sunbeam. No one need be lost for want of knowledge,\nunless he is willfully blind.\nWe thank God that the Bible is prepared for the poor man as\nwell as for the learned man. It is fitted for all ages and all classes.\u2014\nManuscript 16, 1888 (written at Minneapolis, Minn., in autumn of\n1888).\nObjections to the Bible[19]\nHuman minds vary. The minds of different education and thought\nreceive different impressions of the same words, and it is difficult for\none mind to give to one of a different temperament, education, and\nhabits of thought by language exactly the same idea as that which is\nclear and distinct in his own mind. Yet to honest men, right-minded\nmen, he can be so simple and plain as to convey his meaning for all\npractical purposes. If the man he communicates with is not honest\nand will not want to see and understand the truth, he will turn his\nwords and language in everything to suit his own purposes. He will\nmisconstrue his words, play upon his imagination, wrest them from\ntheir true meaning, and then entrench himself in unbelief, claiming\nthat the sentiments are all wrong.\nThis is the way my writings are treated by those who wish to\nmisunderstand and pervert them. They turn the truth of God into a\nlie. In the very same way that they treat the writings in my published\narticles and in my books, so do skeptics and infidels treat the Bible.\nThey read it according to their desire to pervert, to misapply, to\nwillfully wrest the utterances from their true meaning. They declare\nthat the Bible can prove anything and everything, that every sect\nproves their doctrines right, and that the most diverse doctrines are\nproved from the Bible.\nInspiration of the Prophetic Writers 15\nThe writers of the Bible had to express their ideas in human lan-\nguage. It was written by human men. These men were inspired of the\nHoly Spirit. Because of the imperfections of human understanding\nof language, or the perversity of the human mind, ingenious in evad-\ning truth, many read and understand the Bible to please themselves.\nIt is not that the difficulty is in the Bible. Opposing politicians argue\npoints of law in the statute book, and take opposite views in their\napplication and in these laws.\nThe Scriptures were given to men, not in a continuous chain of\nunbroken utterances, but piece by piece through successive genera-\ntions, as God in His providence saw a fitting opportunity to impress\nman at sundry times and divers places. Men wrote as they were [20]\nmoved upon by the Holy Ghost. There is \u201cfirst the bud, then the\nblossom, and next the fruit,\u201d \u201cfirst the blade, then the ear, after that\nthe full corn in the ear.\u201d This is exactly what the Bible utterances are\nto us.\nThere is not always perfect order or apparent unity in the Scrip-\ntures. The miracles of Christ are not given in exact order, but are\ngiven just as the circumstances occurred, which called for this di-\nvine revealing of the power of Christ. The truths of the Bible are\nas pearls hidden. They must be searched, dug out by painstaking\neffort. Those who take only a surface view of the Scriptures will,\nwith their superficial knowledge, which they think is very deep, talk\nof the contradictions of the Bible, and question the authority of the\nScriptures. But those whose hearts are in harmony with truth and\nduty will search the Scriptures with a heart prepared to receive divine\nimpressions. The illuminated soul sees a spiritual unity, one grand\ngolden thread running through the whole, but it requires patience,\nthought, and prayer to trace out the precious golden thread. Sharp\ncontentions over the Bible have led to investigation and revealed the\nprecious jewels of truth. Many tears have been shed, many prayers\noffered, that the Lord would open the understanding to His Word.\nThe Bible is not given to us in grand superhuman language.\nJesus, in order to reach man where he is, took humanity. The Bible\nmust be given in the language of men. Everything that is human\nis imperfect. Different meanings are expressed by the same word;\nthere is not one word for each distinct idea. The Bible was given for\npractical purposes.\n16 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe stamps of minds are different. All do not understand expres-\nsions and statements alike. Some understand the statements of the\nScriptures to suit their own particular minds and cases. Preposses-\nsions, prejudices, and passions have a strong influence to darken the\nunderstanding and confuse the mind even in reading the words of\nHoly Writ.\nThe disciples traveling to Emmaus needed to be disentangled\nin their interpretation of the Scriptures. Jesus walked with them[21]\ndisguised, and as a man He talked with them. Beginning at Moses\nand the prophets He taught them in all things concerning Himself,\nthat His life, His mission, His sufferings, His death were just as\nthe Word of God had foretold. He opened their understanding that\nthey might understand the Scriptures. How quickly He straightened\nout the tangled ends and showed the unity and divine verity of the\nScriptures. How much men in these times need their understanding\nopened.\nThe Bible is written by inspired men, but it is not God\u2019s mode\nof thought and expression. It is that of humanity. God, as a writer, is\nnot represented. Men will often say such an expression is not like\nGod. But God has not put Himself in words, in logic, in rhetoric, on\ntrial in the Bible. The writers of the Bible were God\u2019s penmen, not\nHis pen. Look at the different writers.\nIt is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men\nthat were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man\u2019s words or his\nexpressions but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the\nHoly Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words and thoughts\nreceive the impress of the individual mind. The divine mind is\ndiffused. The divine mind and will is combined with the human\nmind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the word of God.\u2014\nManuscript 24, 1886 (written in Europe in 1886).\nUnity in Diversity\nThere is variety in a tree, there are scarcely two leaves just alike.\nYet this variety adds to the perfection of the tree as a whole.\nIn our Bible, we might ask, Why need Matthew, Mark, Luke,\nand John in the Gospels, why need the Acts of the Apostles, and the\nvariety of writers in the Epistles, go over the same thing?\nInspiration of the Prophetic Writers 17\nThe Lord gave His word in just the way He wanted it to come. He\ngave it through different writers, each having his own individuality,\nthough going over the same history. Their testimonies are brought\ntogether in one Book, and are like the testimonies in a social meeting. [22]\nThey do not represent things in just the same style. Each has an\nexperience of his own, and this diversity broadens and deepens the\nknowledge that is brought out to meet the necessities of varied minds.\nThe thoughts expressed have not a set uniformity, as if cast in an\niron mold, making the very hearing monotonous. In such uniformity\nthere would be a loss of grace and distinctive beauty....\nThe Creator of all ideas may impress different minds with the\nsame thought, but each may express it in a different way, yet without\ncontradiction. The fact that this difference exists should not perplex\nor confuse us. It is seldom that two persons will view and express\ntruth in the very same way. Each dwells on particular points which\nhis constitution and education have fitted him to appreciate. The\nsunlight falling upon the different objects gives those objects a\ndifferent hue.\nThrough the inspiration of His Spirit the Lord gave His apostles\ntruth, to be expressed according to the development of their minds\nby the Holy Spirit. But the mind is not cramped, as if forced into a\ncertain mold.\u2014Letter 53, 1900.\nThe Lord Speaks in Imperfect Speech\nThe Lord speaks to human beings in imperfect speech, in order\nthat the degenerate senses, the dull, earthly perception, of earthly\nbeings may comprehend His words. Thus is shown God\u2019s conde-\nscension. He meets fallen human beings where they are. The Bible,\nperfect as it is in its simplicity, does not answer to the great ideas\nof God; for infinite ideas cannot be perfectly embodied in finite\nvehicles of thought. Instead of the expressions of the Bible being\nexaggerated, as many people suppose, the strong expressions break\ndown before the magnificence of the thought, though the penman\nselected the most expressive language through which to convey the\ntruths of higher education. Sinful beings can only bear to look upon\na shadow of the brightness of heaven\u2019s glory.\u2014Letter 121, 1901.\n18 Selected Messages Book 1\nNo Man to Pronounce Judgment on God\u2019s Word[23]\nBoth in the [Battle Creek] Tabernacle and in the college the\nsubject of inspiration has been taught, and finite men have taken\nit upon themselves to say that some things in the Scriptures were\ninspired and some were not. I was shown that the Lord did not inspire\nthe articles on inspiration published in the Review, [Reference here\nis to a series of articles the writer of which advocated that there\nwere \u201cDifferences in Degrees\u201d of inspiration. See The Review and\nHerald, January 15, 1884.\u2014Compilers.] neither did He approve their\nendorsement before our youth in the college. When men venture to\ncriticize the Word of God, they venture on sacred, holy ground, and\nhad better fear and tremble and hide their wisdom as foolishness.\nGod sets no man to pronounce judgment on His Word, selecting\nsome things as inspired and discrediting others as uninspired. The\ntestimonies have been treated in the same way; but God is not in\nthis.\u2014Letter 22, 1889.\nChapter 2\u2014Ellen G. White and Her Writings [24]\nA Letter to Dr. Paulson\nSt. Helena, California,\nJune 14, 1906\nDear Brother,\nYour letter came to me while in southern California. For some\nweeks the consideration of matters connected with the development\nof our sanitarium work there, and the writing out of the views given\nme regarding the earthquake and its lessons, have taken my time and\nstrength.\nBut now I must respond to the letters received from you and\nothers. In your letter you speak of your early training to have implicit\nfaith in the testimonies and say, \u201cI was led to conclude and most\nfirmly believe that every word that you ever spoke in public or\nprivate, that every letter you wrote under any and all circumstances,\nwas as inspired as the Ten Commandments.\u201d\nMy brother, you have studied my writings diligently, and you\nhave never found that I have made any such claims, neither will you\nfind that the pioneers in our cause ever made such claims.\nIn my introduction to The Great Controversy you have no doubt\nread my statement regarding the Ten Commandments and the Bible, [25]\nwhich should have helped you to a correct understanding of the\nmatter under consideration. Here is the statement:\n\u201cThe Bible points to God as its author; yet it was written by\nhuman hands; and in the varied style of its different books it presents\nthe characteristics of the several writers. The truths revealed are\nall \u2018given by inspiration of God\u2019 (2 Timothy 3:16); yet they are\nexpressed in the words of men. The Infinite One by His Holy Spirit\nhas shed light into the minds and hearts of His servants. He has\ngiven dreams and visions, symbols and figures; and those to whom\nthe truth was thus revealed, have themselves embodied the thought\nin human language.\n19\n20 Selected Messages Book 1\n\u201cThe Ten Commandments were spoken by God Himself, and\nwere written by His own hand. They are of divine, and not human\ncomposition. But the Bible, with its God-given truths expressed in\nthe language of men, presents a union of the divine and the human.\nSuch a union existed in the nature of Christ, who was the Son of\nGod and the Son of man. Thus it is true of the Bible, as it was of\nChrist, that \u2018the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us\u2019 (John\n1:14).\n\u201cWritten in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank\nand occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books\nof the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in\nthe nature of the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are\nemployed by different writers; often the same truth is more strikingly\npresented by one than by another. And as several writers present\na subject under varied aspects and relations, there may appear, to\nthe superficial, careless, or prejudiced reader, to be discrepancy or\ncontradiction, where the thoughtful, reverent student, with clearer\ninsight, discerns the underlying harmony.\n\u201cAs presented through different individuals, the truth is brought\nout in its varied aspects. One writer is more strongly impressed with\none phase of the subject; he grasps those points that harmonize with\nhis experience or with his power of perception and appreciation;\nanother seizes upon a different phase; and each, under the guid-[26]\nance of the Holy Spirit, presents what is most forcibly impressed\nupon his own mind\u2014a different aspect of the truth in each, but a\nperfect harmony through all. And the truths thus revealed unite to\nform a perfect whole, adapted to meet the wants of men in all the\ncircumstances and experiences of life.\n\u201cGod has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world\nby human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified\nmen and enabled them to do His work. He guided the mind in\nthe selection of what to speak and what to write. The treasure was\nentrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, none the less, from Heaven. The\ntestimony is conveyed through the imperfect expression of human\nlanguage, yet it is the testimony of God; and the obedient, believing\nchild of God beholds in it the glory of a divine power, full of grace\nand truth.\u201d\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 21\nThe Integrity of the Testimonies\nIn perfect harmony with this are my statements found in the\narticle \u201cThe Testimonies Slighted,\u201d written June 20, 1882, and pub-\nlished in Testimonies for the Church 5:31, 62-84. From this I quote\nfor your consideration, several paragraphs:\n\u201cMany are looking with self-complacency upon the long years\nduring which they have advocated the truth. They now feel that\nthey are entitled to a reward for their past trials and obedience. But\nthis genuine experience in the things of God in the past, makes\nthem more guilty before Him for not preserving their integrity and\ngoing forward to perfection. The faithfulness for the past year will\nnever atone for the neglect of the present year. A man\u2019s truthfulness\nyesterday will not atone for his falsehood today.\n\u201cMany excused their disregard of the testimonies by saying, \u2018Sis-\nter White is influenced by her husband; the testimonies are molded\nby his spirit and judgment.\u2019 Others were seeking to gain something\nfrom me which they could construe to justify their course or to give\nthem influence. It was then I decided that nothing more should go [27]\nfrom my pen until the converting power of God was seen in the\nchurch. But the Lord placed the burden upon my soul. I labored for\nyou earnestly. How much this cost both my husband and myself,\neternity will tell. Have I not a knowledge of the state of the church,\nwhen the Lord has presented their case before me again and again\nfor years? Repeated warnings have been given, yet there has been\nno decided change.. . .\n\u201cYet now when I send you a testimony of warning and reproof,\nmany of you declare it to be merely the opinion of Sister White. You\nhave thereby insulted the Spirit of God. You know how the Lord has\nmanifested Himself through the Spirit of prophecy. Past, present,\nand future have passed before me. I have been shown faces that I\nhad never seen, and years afterward I knew them when I saw them.\nI have been aroused from my sleep with a vivid sense of subjects\npreviously presented to my mind and I have written, at midnight,\nletters that have gone across the continent, and arriving at a crisis,\nhave saved great disaster to the cause of God. This has been my work\nfor many years. A power has impelled me to reprove and rebuke\n22 Selected Messages Book 1\nwrongs that I had not thought of. Is this work of the last thirty-six\nyears from above or from beneath?...\n\u201cWhen I went to Colorado I was so burdened for you that, in\nmy weakness, I wrote many pages to be read at your camp meeting.\nWeak and trembling, I arose at three o\u2019clock in the morning to write\nto you. God was speaking through clay. You might say that this\ncommunication was only a letter. Yes, it was a letter, but prompted\nby the Spirit of God, to bring before your minds things that had been\nshown me. In these letters which I write, in the testimonies I bear, I\nam presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to me. I do\nnot write one article in the paper, expressing merely my own ideas.\nThey are what God has opened before me in vision\u2014the precious\nrays of light shining from the throne....\n\u201cWhat voice will you acknowledge as the voice of God? What\npower has the Lord in reserve to correct your errors and show you[28]\nyour course as it is? What power to work in the church? If you\nrefuse to believe until every shadow of uncertainty and every possi-\nbility of doubt is removed, you will never believe. The doubt that\ndemands perfect knowledge will never yield to faith. Faith rests\nupon evidence, not demonstration. The Lord requires us to obey\nthe voice of duty, when there are other voices all around us urging\nus to pursue an opposite course. It requires earnest attention from\nus to distinguish the voice which speaks from God. We must resist\nand conquer inclination, and obey the voice of conscience without\nparleying or compromise, lest its promptings cease, and will and\nimpulse control.\n\u201cThe word of the Lord comes to us all who have not resisted His\nSpirit by determining not to hear and obey. This voice is heard in\nwarnings, in counsels, in reproof. It is the Lord\u2019s message of light to\nHis people. If we wait for louder calls or better opportunities, the\nlight may be withdrawn, and we left in darkness.. . .\n\u201cIt pains me to say, my brethren, that your sinful neglect to\nwalk in the light has enshrouded you in darkness. You may now\nbe honest in not recognizing and obeying the light; the doubts you\nhave entertained, your neglect to heed the requirements of God, have\nblinded your perception so that darkness is now to you light, and\nlight is darkness. God has bidden you to go forward to perfection.\nChristianity is a religion of progress. Light from God is full and\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 23\nample, waiting our demand upon it. Whatever blessings the Lord\nmay give, He has an infinite supply beyond, an inexhaustible store\nfrom which we may draw. Skepticism may treat the sacred claims of\nthe gospel with jests, scoffing, and denial. The spirit of worldliness\nmay contaminate the many and control the few; the cause of God\nmay hold its ground only by great exertion and continual sacrifice,\nyet it will triumph finally.\n\u201cThe word is: Go forward; discharge your individual duty, and\nleave all consequences in the hands of God. If we move forward\nwhere Jesus leads the way we shall see His triumph, we shall share\nHis joy. We must share the conflicts if we wear the crown of victory. [29]\nLike Jesus, we must be made perfect through suffering. Had Christ\u2019s\nlife been one of ease, then might we safely yield to sloth. Since\nHis life was marked with continual self-denial, suffering, and self-\nsacrifice, we shall make no complaint if we are partakers with Him.\nWe can walk safely in the darkest path if we have the Light of the\nworld for our guide.. . .\n\u201cWhen the Lord last presented your case before me, and made\nknown to me that you had not regarded the light which had been\ngiven you, I was bidden to speak to you plainly in His name, for\nHis anger was kindled against you. These words were spoken to me:\n\u2018Your work is appointed you of God. Many will not hear you, for\nthey refused to hear the Great Teacher; many will not be corrected,\nfor their ways are right in their own eyes. Yet bear to them the\nreproofs and warnings I shall give you, whether they will hear or\nforbear.\u2019\u201d...\nIn connection with these quotations, study again the article \u201cThe\nNature and Influence of the Testimonies,\u201d in Testimonies, volume 5,\npages 654-691.\nThe statement which you quote from Testimony No. 31 [volume\n5, 67] is correct: \u201cIn these letters which I write, in the testimonies I\nbear, I am presenting to you that which the Lord has presented to\nme. I do not write one article in the paper expressing merely my\nown ideas. They are what God has opened before me in vision\u2014the\nprecious rays of light shining from the throne.\u201d It is true concerning\nthe articles in our papers and in the many volumes of my books. I\nhave been instructed in accordance with the Word in the precepts of\nthe law of God. I have been instructed in selecting from the lessons\n24 Selected Messages Book 1\nof Christ. Are not the positions taken in my writings in harmony\nwith the teachings of Jesus Christ?\nPeril of Deceptive Representations\nTo some of the questions you have asked, I am not to answer\nYes or No. I must not make statements that can be misconstrued.\nI see and feel the peril of those who, I have been instructed, are\nendangering their souls at times by listening to deceptive represen-[30]\ntations regarding the messages that God has given me. Through\nmany twistings and turnings and false reasonings on what I have\nwritten, they try to vindicate their personal unbelief. I am sorry for\nmy brethren who have been walking in the mist of suspicion and\nskepticism and false reasoning. I know that some of them would be\nblessed by messages of counsel if the clouds obscuring their spiritual\nvision could be driven back, and they could see aright. But they do\nnot see clearly. Therefore I dare not communicate with them. When\nthe Spirit of God clears away the mysticism, there will be found just\nas complete comfort and faith and hope in the messages that I have\nbeen instructed to give, as were found in them in years past.\nTruth will surely bear away the victory. The One who gave His\nlife to ransom man from the delusions of Satan, is not asleep, but\nwatching. When His sheep turn away from following the voice of\na stranger, whose sheep they are not, they will rejoice in the voice\nthey have loved to follow.\nWe can learn precious lessons from the study of the life of Christ.\nThe envious Pharisees misinterpreted the acts and words of Christ,\nwhich, if properly received, would have been beneficial to their\nspiritual understanding. Instead of admiring His goodness, they\ncharged Him, in the presence of His disciples, with impiety\u2014\u201cWhy\neateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\u201d (Matthew 9:11).\nInstead of addressing our blessed Saviour Himself, whose answer\nwould at once have convicted them of their malice, they talked with\nthe disciples, and made their charges where, as a leaven of evil, they\nwould do great harm. If Christ had been an impious man, He would\nhave lost His hold upon the hearts of His believing followers. But\nbecause of their confidence in Christ, the disciples would not give\near to the insinuations of His wicked accusers.\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 25\nDesiring to bring censure upon the disciples, these wicked ac-\ncusers went again and again to Christ with the question, Why do Thy\ndisciples that which is not lawful? And when they judged our Lord\nto have transgressed, they spoke, not to Himself, but to His disciples, [31]\nto plant the seeds of unbelief in the hearts of His followers.\nThus they worked to bring in doubt and dissension. Every\nmethod was tried to bring doubt into the hearts of the little flock,\nthat it might cause them to watch for something that would check\nthe good and gracious work of the gospel of Jesus Christ.\nWork of this same character will be brought to bear upon true\nbelievers today. The Lord Jesus reads the heart; He discerns the\ninterests and purposes of the thoughts of all men concerning Himself\nand His believing disciples. He answers their thoughts concerning\nthe faultfinding ones, \u201cThey that be whole need not a physician, but\nthey that are sick\u201d (Matthew 9:12). The insolent Pharisees had an\nexalted idea of their own piety and holiness, while they were ready\nto pass censure on the lives of others.\u2014Letter 206, 1906.\nThe Lord\u2019s Messenger\nLast night, in vision, I was standing before an assembly of our\npeople, bearing a decided testimony regarding present truth and\npresent duty. After the discourse, many gathered about me, asking\nquestions. They desired so many explanations about this point, and\nthat point, and another point, that I said, \u201cOne at a time, if you please,\nlest you confuse me.\u201d\nAnd then I appealed to them, saying: \u201cFor years you have had\nmany evidences that the Lord has given me a work to do. These\nevidences could scarcely have been greater than they are. Will you\nbrush away all these evidences as a cobweb, at the suggestion of a\nman\u2019s unbelief? That which makes my heart ache is the fact that\nmany who are now perplexed and tempted are those who have had\nabundance of evidence and opportunity to consider and pray and\nunderstand; and yet they do not discern the nature of the sophistries\nthat are presented to influence them to reject the warnings God has\ngiven to save them from the delusions of these last days.\u201d\nSome have stumbled over the fact that I said I did not claim to [32]\nbe a prophet; [Reference is here made to a discourse given at Battle\n26 Selected Messages Book 1\nCreek, October 2, 1904, in which she said, \u201cI do not claim to be a\nprophetess.\u201d\u2014Compilers.] and they have asked, Why is this?\nI have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I\nam the Lord\u2019s messenger; that He called me in my youth to be His\nmessenger, to receive His word, and to give a clear and decided\nmessage in the name of the Lord Jesus.\nEarly in my youth I was asked several times, Are you a prophet?\nI have ever responded, I am the Lord\u2019s messenger. I know that\nmany have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this\ntitle. My Saviour declared me to be His messenger. \u201cYour work,\u201d\nHe instructed me, \u201cis to bear My word. Strange things will arise,\nand in your youth I set you apart to bear the message to the erring\nones, to carry the word before unbelievers, and with pen and voice\nto reprove from the Word actions that are not right. Exhort from\nthe Word. I will make My Word open to you. It shall not be as a\nstrange language. In the true eloquence of simplicity, with voice and\npen, the messages that I give shall be heard from one who has never\nlearned in the schools. My Spirit and My power shall be with you.\n\u201cBe not afraid of man, for My shield shall protect you. It is not\nyou that speaketh: it is the Lord that giveth the messages of warning\nand reproof. Never deviate from the truth under any circumstances.\nGive the light I shall give you. The messages for these last days shall\nbe written in books, and shall stand immortalized, to testify against\nthose who have once rejoiced in the light, but who have been led to\ngive it up because of the seductive influences of evil.\u201d\nWhy have I not claimed to be a prophet?\u2014Because in these days\nmany who boldly claim that they are prophets are a reproach to the\ncause of Christ; and because my work includes much more than the\nword \u201cprophet\u201d signifies.\nWhen this work was first given me, I begged the Lord to lay the\nburden on someone else. The work was so large and broad and deep\nthat I feared I could not do it. But by His Holy Spirit the Lord has[33]\nenabled me to perform the work which He gave me to do.\nA Work of Many Features\nGod has made plain to me the various ways in which He would\nuse me to carry forward a special work. Visions have been given me,\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 27\nwith the promise, \u201cIf you deliver the messages faithfully and endure\nto the end, you shall eat of the fruit of the tree of life, and drink of\nthe water of the river of life.\u201d\nThe Lord gave me great light on health reform. In connection\nwith my husband, I was to be a medical missionary worker. I was\nto set an example to the church by taking the sick to my home and\ncaring for them. This I have done, giving the women and children\nvigorous treatment. I was also to speak on the subject of Christian\ntemperance, as the Lord\u2019s appointed messenger. I engaged heartily\nin this work, and spoke to large assemblies on temperance in its\nbroadest and truest sense.\nI was instructed that I must ever urge upon those who profess to\nbelieve the truth, the necessity of practicing the truth. This means\nsanctification, and sanctification means the culture and training of\nevery capability for the Lord\u2019s service.\nI was charged not to neglect or pass by those who were being\nwronged. I was specially charged to protest against any arbitrary\nor overbearing action toward the ministers of the gospel by those\nhaving official authority. Disagreeable though the duty may be, I am\nto reprove the oppressor, and plead for justice. I am to present the\nnecessity of maintaining justice and equity in all our institutions.\nIf I see those in positions of trust neglecting aged ministers,\nI am to present the matter to those whose duty it is to care for\nthem. Ministers who have faithfully done their work are not to be\nforgotten or neglected when they have become feeble in health. Our\nconferences are not to disregard the needs of those who have borne\nthe burdens of the work. It was after John had grown old in the\nservice of the Lord that he was exiled to Patmos. And on that lonely [34]\nisle he received more communications from heaven than he had\nreceived during the rest of his lifetime.\nAfter my marriage I was instructed that I must show a special\ninterest in motherless and fatherless children, taking some under my\nown charge for a time, and then finding homes for them. Thus I\nwould be giving others an example of what they could do.\nAlthough called to travel often, and having much writing to do, I\nhave taken children of three and five years of age, and have cared for\nthem, educated them, and trained them for responsible positions. I\nhave taken into my home from time to time boys from ten to sixteen\n28 Selected Messages Book 1\nyears of age, giving them motherly care, and a training for service. I\nhave felt it my duty to bring before our people that work for which\nthose in every church should feel a responsibility.\nWhile in Australia I carried on this same line of work, taking\ninto my home orphan children, who were in danger of being exposed\nto temptations that might cause the loss of their souls.\nIn Australia we [Reference here is to her associate workers.\nJames White died in 1881.] also worked as Christian medical mis-\nsionaries. At times I made my home in Cooranbong an asylum for\nthe sick and afflicted. My secretary, who had received a training in\nthe Battle Creek Sanitarium, stood by my side, and did the work of a\nmissionary nurse. No charge was made for her services, and we won\nthe confidence of the people by the interest that we manifested in the\nsick and suffering. After a time the Health Retreat at Cooranbong\nwas built, and then we were relieved of this burden.\nNo Boastful Claims\nTo claim to be a prophetess is something that I have never done.\nIf others call me by that name, I have no controversy with them.\nBut my work has covered so many lines that I cannot call myself\nother than a messenger, sent to bear a message from the Lord to His\npeople, and to take up work in any line that He points out.\nWhen I was last in Battle Creek, I said before a large congre-[35]\ngation that I did not claim to be a prophetess. Twice I referred to\nthis matter, intending each time to make the statement, \u201cI do not\nclaim to be a prophetess.\u201d If I spoke otherwise than this, let all now\nunderstand that what I had in mind to say was that I do not claim the\ntitle of prophet or prophetess.\nI understood that some were anxious to know if Mrs. White still\nheld the same views that she did years ago when they had heard her\nspeak in the sanitarium grove, in the Tabernacle, and at the camp\nmeetings held in the suburbs of Battle Creek. I assured them that\nthe message she bears today is the same that she has borne during\nthe sixty years of her public ministry. She has the same service\nto do for the Master that was laid upon her in her girlhood. She\nreceives lessons from the same Instructor. The directions given her\nare, \u201cMake known to others what I have revealed to you. Write out\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 29\nthe messages that I give you, that the people may have them.\u201d This\nis what she has endeavored to do.\nI have written many books, and they have been given a wide\ncirculation. Of myself I could not have brought out the truth in these\nbooks, but the Lord has given me the help of His Holy Spirit. These\nbooks, giving the instruction that the Lord has given me during the\npast sixty years, contain light from heaven, and will bear the test of\ninvestigation.\nAt the age of seventy-eight I am still toiling. We are all in the\nhands of the Lord. I trust in Him; for I know that He will never\nleave nor forsake those who put their trust in Him. I have committed\nmyself to His keeping.\n\u201cAnd I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for\nthat he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry\u201d (1 Timothy\n1:12).\u2014The Review and Herald, July 26, 1906.\nThe Work of a Prophet and More\nDuring the discourse, I said that I did not claim to be a prophetess.\nSome were surprised at this statement, and as much is being said [36]\nin regard to it, I will make an explanation. Others have called me a\nprophetess, but I have never assumed that title. I have not felt that it\nwas my duty thus to designate myself. Those who boldly assume\nthat they are prophets in this our day are often a reproach to the\ncause of Christ.\nMy work includes much more than this name signifies. I regard\nmyself as a messenger, entrusted by the Lord with messages for His\npeople.\u2014Letter 55, 1905.\nI am now instructed that I am not to be hindered in my work\nby those who engage in suppositions regarding its nature, whose\nminds are struggling with so many intricate problems connected\nwith the supposed work of a prophet. My commission embraces the\nwork of a prophet, but it does not end there. It embraces much more\nthan the minds of those who have been sowing the seeds of unbelief\ncan comprehend.\u2014Letter 244, 1906. (Addressed to elders of Battle\nCreek church.)\n30 Selected Messages Book 1\nReceiving and Imparting the Light\nAs inquiries are frequently made as to my state in vision, and\nafter I come out, I would say that when the Lord sees fit to give a\nvision, I am taken into the presence of Jesus and angels, and am\nentirely lost to earthly things. I can see no farther than the angel\ndirects me. My attention is often directed to scenes transpiring upon\nearth.\nAt times I am carried far ahead into the future and shown what is\nto take place. Then again I am shown things as they have occurred\nin the past. After I come out of vision I do not at once remember\nall that I have seen, and the matter is not so clear before me until\nI write, then the scene rises before me as was presented in vision,\nand I can write with freedom. Sometimes the things which I have\nseen are hid from me after I come out of vision, and I cannot call\nthem to mind until I am brought before a company where that vision\napplies, then the things which I have seen come to my mind with\nforce. I am just as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in relating\nor writing a vision, as in having the vision. It is impossible for me\nto call up things which have been shown me unless the Lord brings[37]\nthem before me at the time that He is pleased to have me relate or\nwrite them.\u2014Spiritual Gifts 2:292, 293 (1860).\nAlthough I am as dependent upon the Spirit of the Lord in writing\nmy views as I am in receiving them, yet the words I employ in\ndescribing what I have seen are my own, unless they be those spoken\nto me by an angel, which I always enclose in marks of quotation.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, October 8, 1867.\nThe question is asked, How does Sister White know in regard to\nthe matters of which she speaks so decidedly, as if she had authority\nto say these things? I speak thus because they flash upon my mind\nwhen in perplexity like lightning out of a dark cloud in the fury\nof a storm. Some scenes presented before me years ago have not\nbeen retained in my memory, but when the instruction then given\nis needed, sometimes even when I am standing before the people,\nthe remembrance comes sharp and clear, like a flash of lightning,\nbringing to mind distinctly that particular instruction. At such times\nI cannot refrain from saying the things that flash into my mind,\nnot because I have had a new vision, but because that which was\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 31\npresented to me perhaps years in the past has been recalled to my\nmind forcibly.\u2014The Writing and Sending Out of the Testimonies,\n24.\nNo Claim to Infallibility\nWe have many lessons to learn, and many, many to unlearn. God\nand heaven alone are infallible. Those who think that they will never\nhave to give up a cherished view, never have occasion to change an\nopinion, will be disappointed. As long as we hold to our own ideas\nand opinions with determined persistency, we cannot have the unity\nfor which Christ prayed.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 26, 1892.\nIn regard to infallibility, I never claimed it; God alone is infalli-\nble. His word is true, and in Him is no variableness, or shadow of\nturning.\u2014Letter 10, 1895.\nThe Sacred and the Common [38]\nSanitarium, California\nMarch 5, 1909\nI am troubled in regard to Brother A, who for some years has\nbeen a worker in southern California. He has made some strange\nstatements, and I am pained to see him denying the testimonies as a\nwhole because of what seems to him an inconsistency\u2014a statement\nmade by me in regard to the number of rooms in the Paradise Valley\nSanitarium. Brother A says that in a letter written to one of the\nbrethren in southern California, the statement was made by me that\nthe sanitarium contained forty rooms, when there were really only\nthirty-eight. This, Brother A gives to me as the reason why he has\nlost confidence in the testimonies....\nThe information given concerning the number of rooms in the\nParadise Valley Sanitarium was given, not as a revelation from the\nLord, but simply as a human opinion. There has never been revealed\nto me the exact number of rooms in any of our sanitariums; and the\nknowledge I have obtained of such things I have gained by inquiring\nof those who were supposed to know. In my words, when speaking\nupon these common subjects, there is nothing to lead minds to\n32 Selected Messages Book 1\nbelieve that I receive my knowledge in a vision from the Lord and\nam stating it as such....\nWhen the Holy Spirit reveals anything regarding the institutions\nconnected with the Lord\u2019s work, or concerning the work of God upon\nhuman hearts and minds, as He has revealed these things through\nme in the past, the message given is to be regarded as light given of\nGod for those who need it. But for one to mix the sacred with the\ncommon is a great mistake. In a tendency to do this we may see the\nworking of the enemy to destroy souls.\nTo every soul whom God has created He has given capabilities to\nserve Him, but Satan seeks to make this work of service hard by his\nconstant temptation to mislead souls. He works to dim the spiritual\nperceptions that men may not distinguish between that which is\ncommon and that which is holy. I have been made to know this[39]\ndistinction through a life\u2019s service for my Lord and Master.. . .\nThe message came to me, Dedicate yourself to the highest work\never committed to mortals. I will give you high aspirations and\npowers and a true sense of the work of Christ. You are not your\nown, for you are bought with a price, by the life and death of the\nSon of God. God calls for your child\u2019s heart and service under the\nsanctification of the Holy Spirit.\nI gave myself, my whole being, to God, to obey His call in\neverything, and since that time my life has been spent in giving the\nmessage, with my pen and in speaking before large congregations.\nIt is not I who controls my words and actions at such times.\nBut there are times when common things must be stated, com-\nmon thoughts must occupy the mind, common letters must be written\nand information given that has passed from one to another of the\nworkers. Such words, such information, are not given under the\nspecial inspiration of the Spirit of God. Questions are asked at\ntimes that are not upon religious subjects at all, and these questions\nmust be answered. We converse about houses and lands, trades to\nbe made, and locations for our institutions, their advantages and\ndisadvantages.\nI receive letters asking for advice on many strange subjects, and\nI advise according to the light that has been given me. Men have\nagain and again opposed the counsel that I have been instructed\nto give because they did not want to receive the light given, and\nEllen G. White and Her Writings 33\nsuch experiences have led me to seek the Lord most earnestly.\u2014\nManuscript 107, 1909.\nChapter 3\u2014Attitudes Toward the Testimonies[40]\nAn Early Statement\nI saw the state of some who stood on present truth, but disre-\ngarded the visions\u2014the way God had chosen to teach in some cases,\nthose who erred from Bible truth. I saw that in striking against the\nvisions they did not strike against the worm\u2014the feeble instrument\nthat God spake through\u2014but against the Holy Ghost. I saw it was a\nsmall thing to speak against the instrument, but it was dangerous to\nslight the words of God. I saw if they were in error and God chose\nto show them their errors through visions, and they disregarded the\nteachings of God through visions, they would be left to take their\nown way, and run in the way of error, and think they were right, until\nthey would find it out too late. Then in the time of trouble I heard\nthem cry to God in agony, \u201cWhy didst Thou not show us our wrong,\nthat we might have got right and been ready for this time?\u201d Then an\nangel pointed to them and said, \u201cMy Father taught, but you would\nnot be taught. He spoke through visions, but you disregarded His\nvoice, and He gave you up to your own ways, to be filled with your\nown doings.\u201d\u2014Broadside, To Those Who Are Receiving the Seal of\nthe Living God, January 31, 1849.\nSafe Instruction for Closing Days[41]\nA wealth of moral influence has been brought to us in the last\nhalf century. Through His Holy Spirit the voice of God has come\nto us continually in warning and instruction, to confirm the faith\nof the believers in the Spirit of prophecy. Repeatedly the word has\ncome, Write the things that I have given you to confirm the faith of\nMy people in the position they have taken. Time and trial have not\nmade void the instruction given, but through years of suffering and\nself-sacrifice have established the truth of the testimony given. The\ninstruction that was given in the early days of the message is to be\nheld as safe instruction to follow in these its closing days. Those\n34\nAttitudes Toward the Testimonies 35\nwho are indifferent to this light and instruction must not expect to\nescape the snares which we have been plainly told will cause the\nrejecters of light to stumble, and fall, and be snared, and be taken.\nIf we study carefully the second chapter of Hebrews, we shall learn\nhow important it is that we hold steadfastly to every principle of\ntruth that has been given.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 18, 1907.\nVarying Attitudes Enumerated\nSoon every possible effort will be made to discount and pervert\nthe truth of the testimonies of God\u2019s Spirit. We must have in readi-\nness the clear, straight messages that since 1846 have been coming\nto God\u2019s people.\nThere will be those once united with us in the faith who will\nsearch for new, strange doctrines, for something odd and sensational\nto present to the people. They will bring in all conceivable fallacies,\nand will present them as coming from Mrs. White, that they may\nbeguile souls.. . .\nThose who have treated the light that the Lord has given as a\ncommon thing will not be benefited by the instruction presented.\nThere are those who will misinterpret the messages that God has\ngiven, in accordance with their spiritual blindness.\nSome will yield their faith, and will deny the truth of the mes-\nsages, pointing to them as falsehoods.\nSome will hold them up to ridicule, working against the light [42]\nthat God has been giving for years, and some who are weak in the\nfaith will thus be led astray.\nBut others will be greatly helped by the messages. Though\nnot personally addressed, they will be corrected, and will be led\nto shun the evils specified.... The Spirit of the Lord will be in the\ninstruction, and doubts existing in many minds will be swept away.\nThe testimonies themselves will be the key that will explain the\nmessages given, as scripture is explained by scripture. Many will\nread with eagerness the messages reproving wrong, that they may\nlearn what they may do to be saved.... Light will dawn upon the\nunderstanding, and the Spirit will make an impression on minds, as\nBible truth is clearly and simply presented in the messages that since\n1846 God has been sending His people. These messages are to find\n36 Selected Messages Book 1\ntheir place in hearts, and transformations will take place.\u2014Letter\n73, 1903.\nPerils of Dissecting Inspired Messages\nSome sit in judgment on the Scriptures, declaring that this or\nthat passage is not inspired, because it does not strike their minds\nfavorably. They cannot harmonize it with their ideas of philosophy\nand science, \u201cfalsely so called\u201d (1 Timothy 6:20). Others for dif-\nferent reasons question portions of the Word of God. Thus many\nwalk blindly where the enemy prepares the way. Now, it is not the\nprovince of any man to pronounce sentence upon the Scriptures, to\njudge or condemn any portion of God\u2019s Word. When one presumes\nto do this, Satan will create an atmosphere for him to breathe which\nwill dwarf spiritual growth. When a man feels so very wise that he\ndares to dissect God\u2019s Word, his wisdom is, with God, counted fool-\nishness. When he knows more, he will feel that he has everything to\nlearn. And his very first lesson is to become teachable. \u201cLearn of\nme,\u201d says the Great Teacher; \u201cfor I am meek and lowly in heart: and\nye shall find rest unto your souls\u201d (Matthew 11:29).\nYou who have been educating yourselves and others in a spirit of[43]\ncriticism and accusing, remember that you are imitating the example\nof Satan. When it suits your purpose, you treat the Testimonies as if\nyou believed them, quoting from them to strengthen any statement\nyou wish to have prevail. But how is it when light is given to correct\nyour errors? Do you then accept the light? When the Testimonies\nspeak contrary to your ideas, you treat them very lightly.\nIt does not become anyone to drop a word of doubt here and there\nthat shall work like poison in other minds, shaking their confidence\nin the messages which God has given, which have aided in laying\nthe foundation of this work, and have attended it to the present day,\nin reproofs, warnings, corrections, and encouragements. To all who\nhave stood in the way of the Testimonies, I would say, God has given\na message to His people, and His voice will be heard, whether you\nhear or forbear. Your opposition has not injured me; but you must\ngive an account to the God of heaven, who has sent these warnings\nand instructions to keep His people in the right way. You will have\nAttitudes Toward the Testimonies 37\nto answer to Him for your blindness, for being a stumbling block in\nthe way of sinners.\n\u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according\nto this word, it is because there is no light in them\u201d (Isaiah 8:20).\nEven the work of the Holy Spirit upon the heart is to be tested by\nthe Word of God. The Spirit which inspired the Scriptures, always\nleads to the Scriptures.\u2014General Conference Daily Bulletin, April\n13, 1891.\nInspired Messages Wrongly Applied\nOne man, B by name, came all the way from Michigan with a\nspecial message for Sister White. He said that Sister White had been\nappointed by God to occupy the position occupied by Moses, and\nthat he, B, was to occupy the position of Joshua. Thus the work was\nto be carried forward. Sister White\u2019s work was to be united with his\nwork, and we were to proclaim the truth with power.\nThis man took the liberty, as many others have done, to mingle a\ngreat deal of Scripture with his message, quoting passages which he [44]\napplied to Seventh-day Adventists. During my connection with the\nwork many such men have arisen. They have selected and arranged\nscriptures which they made applicable to the people of God. Mr. B\nread with a loud, strong voice the passages he had selected, declaring\nthem to be applicable to us as a people. He said that I must see that\nhe was right; for was it not the Bible he was reading.\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have selected and put these scriptures together,\nbut like many who have arisen as you have, you are wresting the\nScriptures, interpreting them to mean thus and so, when I know they\ndo not apply as you have applied them.\n\u201cYou, or any other deluded person, could arrange and have ar-\nranged certain scriptures of great force, and applied them according\nto your own ideas. Any man could misinterpret and misapply God\u2019s\nWord, denouncing people and things, and then take the position that\nthose who refused to receive his message had rejected the message\nof God, and decided their destiny for eternity.\u201d...\nFrom the various letters which have come to me, I see that when\nsuch men as B, claiming to be sent by God, go to those who are\nmore or less isolated from our people, these souls are ready to grasp\n38 Selected Messages Book 1\nanything that purports to be of heavenly origin. Letters come to me\nentreating an answer; I know that many men take the testimonies\nthe Lord has given, and apply them as they suppose they should be\napplied, picking out a sentence here and there, taking it from its\nproper connection, and applying it according to their idea. Thus\npoor souls become bewildered, when could they read in order all\nthat has been given, they would see the true application, and would\nnot become confused. Much that purports to be a message from\nSister White, serves the purpose of misrepresenting Sister White,\nmaking her testify in favor of things that are not in accordance with\nher mind or judgment. This makes her work very trying. Reports fly\nfrom one to another regarding what Sister White has said. Each time\nthe report is repeated, it grows larger. If Sister White has anything to\nsay, leave her to say it. No one is called upon to be a mouthpiece for[45]\nSister White.... Please let Sister White bear her own message. It will\ncome with a better grace from her than from the one who reports\nher.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1901.\nDoubting the Testimonies\n[Extract from a sermon at the General Conference of 1883,\nappearing in Notebook Leaflets, The Church, No. 6.]\nWhen you find men questioning the testimonies, finding fault\nwith them, and seeking to draw away the people from their influence,\nbe assured that God is not at work through them. It is another\nspirit. Doubt and unbelief are cherished by those who do not walk\ncircumspectly. They have a painful consciousness that their life will\nnot abide the test of the Spirit of God, whether speaking through\nHis Word or through the testimonies of His Spirit that would bring\nthem to His Word. Instead of beginning with their own hearts, and\ncoming into harmony with the pure principles of the gospel, they\nfind fault, and condemn the very means that God has chosen to fit\nup a people to stand in the day of the Lord.\nLet some skeptical one come along, who is not willing to square\nhis life by the Bible rule, who is seeking to gain the favor of all, and\nhow soon the class that are not in harmony with the work of God are\ncalled out. Those who are converted, and grounded in the truth, will\nAttitudes Toward the Testimonies 39\nfind nothing pleasing or profitable in the influence or teaching of\nsuch a one. But those who are defective in character, whose hands\nare not pure, whose hearts are not holy, whose habits of life are\nloose, who are unkind at home, or untrustworthy in deal\u2014all these\nwill be sure to enjoy the new sentiments presented. All may see, if\nthey will, the true measure of the man, the nature of his teaching,\nfrom the character of his followers.\nThose who have most to say against the testimonies are generally\nthose who have not read them, just as those who boast of their\ndisbelief of the Bible are those who have little knowledge of its [46]\nteachings. They know that it condemns them, and their rejection of\nit gives them a feeling of security in their sinful course.\nError\u2019s Bewitching Power\nThere is in error and unbelief that which bewilders and bewitches\nthe mind. To question and doubt and cherish unbelief in order to\nexcuse ourselves in stepping aside from the straight path is a far\neasier matter than to purify the soul through a belief of the truth, and\nobedience thereto. But when better influences lead one to desire to\nreturn, he finds himself entangled in such a network of Satan, like\na fly in a spider\u2019s web, that it seems a hopeless task to him, and he\nseldom recovers himself from the snare laid for him by the wily foe.\nWhen once men have admitted doubt and unbelief of the tes-\ntimonies of the Spirit of God, they are strongly tempted to adhere\nto the opinions which they have avowed before others. Their theo-\nries and notions fix themselves like a gloomy cloud over the mind,\nshutting out every ray of evidence in favor of the truth. The doubts\nindulged through ignorance, pride, or love of sinful practices, rivet\nupon the soul fetters that are seldom broken. Christ, and He alone,\ncan give the needed power to break them.\nThe testimonies of the Spirit of God are given to direct men to\nHis Word, which has been neglected. Now if their messages are not\nheeded, the Holy Spirit is shut away from the soul. What further\nmeans has God in reserve to reach the erring ones, and show them\ntheir true condition?\nThe churches that have cherished influences which lessen faith in\nthe testimonies, are weak and tottering. Some ministers are working\n40 Selected Messages Book 1\nto attract the people to themselves. When an effort is made to correct\nany wrong in these ministers, they stand back in independence and\nsay, \u201cMy church accepts my labors.\u201d\nJesus said, \u201cEvery one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither\ncometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.\u201d There are\nmany today pursuing a similar course. In the testimonies are speci-[47]\nfied the very sins of which they are guilty; hence they have no desire\nto read them. There are those who from their youth up have re-\nceived warning and reproofs through the testimonies; but have they\nwalked in the light and reformed?\u2014Not at all. They still indulge\nthe same sins; they have the same defects of character. These evils\nmar the work of God, and make their impress upon the churches.\nThe work the Lord would do to set the churches in order is not done,\nbecause the individual members-and especially the leaders of the\nflock\u2014would not be corrected.\nMany a man professes to accept the testimonies, while they have\nno influence upon his life or character. His faults become stronger\nby indulgence until, having been often reproved and not heeding the\nreproof, he loses the power of self-control, and becomes hardened\nin a course of wrongdoing. If he is overworked, if weakness comes\nupon him, he has not moral power to rise above the infirmities of\ncharacter which he did not overcome; they become his strongest\npoints, and he is overborne by them. Then bring him to the test\nand ask, \u201cDid not God reprove this phase in your character by the\ntestimonies years ago?\u201d He will answer, \u201cYes, I received a written\ntestimony saying that I was wrong in these things.\u201d \u201cWhy, then, did\nyou not correct these wrong habits?\u201d \u201cI thought the reprover must\nhave made a mistake; that which I could see, I accepted; that which I\ncould not see, I said was the mind of the one who gave the message.\nI did not accept the reproof.\u201d\nIn some cases the very faults of character which God would have\nHis servants see and correct, but which they refuse to see, have cost\nthese men their life. They might have lived to be channels of light.\nGod wanted them to live, and sent them instruction in righteousness,\nthat they might preserve their physical and mental powers to do\nacceptable service for Him; and had they received the counsel of\nGod, and become altogether such as He would have them, they\nwould have been able workmen for the advancement of the truth,\nAttitudes Toward the Testimonies 41\nmen who would have stood high in the affections and confidence\nof our people. But they are sleeping in the grave, because they did [48]\nnot see that God knew them better than they knew themselves. His\nthoughts were not their thoughts, nor His ways, their ways. These\none-sided men have molded the work wherever they have labored.\nThe churches under their management have been greatly weakened.\nGod reproves men because He loves them. He wants them to be\nstrong in His strength, to have well-balanced minds and symmetrical\ncharacters; then they will be examples to the flock of God, leading\nthem by precept and example nearer to heaven. Then they will build\nup a holy temple for God.\u2014Manuscript 1, 1883.\nSearching the Testimonies for an Excuse\nSome who are not willing to receive the light, but who prefer\nto walk in ways of their own choosing, will search the testimonies\nto find something in them to encourage the spirit of unbelief and\ndisobedience. Thus a spirit of disunion will be brought in; for the\nspirit which leads them to criticize the testimonies will also lead\nthem to watch their brethren to find in them something to condemn.\u2014\nManuscript 73, 1908.\nThe Last Deception of Satan\nSatan is ... constantly pressing in the spurious\u2014to lead away\nfrom the truth. The very last deception of Satan will be to make\nof none effect the testimony of the Spirit of God. \u201cWhere there is\nno vision, the people perish\u201d (Proverbs 29:18). Satan will work\ningeniously, in different ways and through different agencies, to\nunsettle the confidence of God\u2019s remnant people in the true testi-\nmony.\u2014Letter 12, 1890.\nThere will be a hatred kindled against the testimonies which\nis satanic. The workings of Satan will be to unsettle the faith of\nthe churches in them, for this reason: Satan cannot have so clear a\ntrack to bring in his deceptions and bind up souls in his delusions\nif the warnings and reproofs and counsels of the Spirit of God are\nheeded.\u2014Letter 40, 1890.\nChapter 4\u2014The Writing and Sending Out of the[49]\nTestimonies to the Church\n[The material comprising this chapter appeared in a leaflet in 1913.]\nA Review of the Work\nSanitarium, California\nJuly 8, 1906\nDear Brother,\nThere are some who think they are able to measure the character\nand to estimate the importance of the work the Lord has given me\nto do. Their own mind and judgment is the standard by which they\nwould weigh the testimonies.\nMy Instructor said to me, Tell these men that God has not com-\nmitted to them the work of measuring, classifying, and defining the\ncharacter of the testimonies. Those who attempt this are sure to\nerr in their conclusions. The Lord would have men adhere to their\nappointed work. If they will keep the way of the Lord, they will be\nable to discern clearly that the work which He has appointed me to\ndo is not a work of human devising.\nThose who carefully read the testimonies as they have appeared\nfrom the early days, need not be perplexed as to their origin. The[50]\nmany books, written by the help of the Spirit of God, bear a living\nwitness to the character of the testimonies.\nIn the early days of our experience in the message, the Spirit of\nGod often came upon a few of us as we were assembled, and I was\ntaken away in vision. The Lord gave such light and evidence, such\ncomfort and hope and joy, that His praises were upon our lips.\nAssisted by Literary Helpers\nWhile my husband lived, he acted as a helper and counselor in\nthe sending out of the messages that were given to me. We traveled\nextensively. Sometimes light would be given to me in the night\n42\nWriting and Sending Out of the Testimonies to the Church 43\nseason, sometimes in the daytime before large congregations. The\ninstruction I received in vision was faithfully written out by me,\nas I had time and strength for the work. Afterward we examined\nthe matter together, my husband correcting grammatical errors and\neliminating needless repetition. Then it was carefully copied for the\npersons addressed, or for the printer.\nAs the work grew, others assisted me in the preparation of matter\nfor publication. After my husband\u2019s death, faithful helpers joined\nme, who labored untiringly in the work of copying the testimonies\nand preparing articles for publication.\nBut the reports that are circulated, that any of my helpers are\npermitted to add matter or change the meaning of the messages I\nwrite out, are not true.\nWhile we were in Australia the Lord instructed me that W. C.\nWhite should be relieved from the many burdens his brethren would\nlay upon him, that he might be more free to assist me in the work\nthe Lord has laid upon me. The promise had been given, \u201cI will put\nMy Spirit upon him, and give him wisdom.\u201d\nSince my return to America I have several times received in-\nstruction that the Lord has given me W. C. White to be my helper,\nand that in this work the Lord will give him of His Spirit.\nProper Time and Manner of Presentation [51]\nIt requires much wisdom and sound judgment, quickened by the\nSpirit of God, to know the proper time and manner to present the\ninstruction that has been given. When the minds of persons reproved\nare under a strong deception, they naturally resist the testimony;\nand having taken an attitude of resistance, it is difficult for them\nafterward to acknowledge that they have been wrong.\nIn the early days of this cause, if some of the leading brethren\nwere present when messages from the Lord were given, we would\nconsult with them as to the best manner of bringing the instruction\nbefore the people. Sometimes it was decided that certain portions\nwould better not be read before a congregation. Sometimes those\nwhose course was reproved would request that the matters pointing\nout their wrongs and dangers should be read before others, that they,\ntoo, might be benefited.\n44 Selected Messages Book 1\nOften after testimonies of reproof were read, hearty confessions\nwere made. Then we would unite in a season of prayer, and the Lord\nwould manifest His pardoning grace to those who had confessed their\nsins. The acceptance of the testimonies brought the rich blessing of\nGod into our assemblies.\nFaithfully I endeavor to write out that which is given me from\ntime to time by the divine Counselor. Some portions of that which\nI write are sent out immediately to meet the present necessities of\nthe work. Other portions are held until the development of circum-\nstances makes it evident to me that the time has come for their use.\nSometimes in ministers and physicians bearing responsibilities there\nhas developed a disposition to discard the testimonies, and I have\nbeen instructed not to place testimonies in their hands; for having\nyielded to the spirit that tempted and overcame Adam and Eve, they\nhave opened mind and heart to the control of the enemy. Being on\na false track, and laboring under deceptive imaginings, they will\nread into the testimonies things that are not there, but which are in\nagreement with the false statements that they have listened to. By[52]\nreading the testimonies in the light of their own kindling, they are\ndeceived, and will deceive others.\nSometimes, after very clear-cut, decided reproofs have been\nwritten out, they are held for a time until by personal correspondence\nI have endeavored to change the spirit of those to whom they are\naddressed. If these efforts are unsuccessful, the messages, with all\ntheir strength of rebuke or reproof, are sent to them, whether they\nwill hear, or whether they will deny the truthfulness of the message.\nIf those whose errors are pointed out make confession of their\nwrongdoing, the spell of the enemy may be broken. If they will\nrepent and forsake their sins, God is faithful and just to forgive their\nsins, and to cleanse them from all unrighteousness. Christ, the sin-\npardoning Redeemer, will remove the filthy garments from them,\ngive them change of raiment, and set a fair miter upon their head.\nBut so long as they refuse to turn from iniquity they cannot develop\na character that will stand in the great day of judgment.\nOften concealed wrongs in the life of individuals are opened be-\nfore me, and I am bidden to bear a message of reproof and warning.\nI have been told that many who give heed to the false science\nof the enemy would denounce my work as that of a false prophet,\nWriting and Sending Out of the Testimonies to the Church 45\nand would place upon the testimony such interpretations as tend to\nchange the truth of God into a lie. Satan is on the alert; and some\nwho in the past have been used by the Lord in doing His work, but\nwho have permitted themselves to be deceived, will be stirred up\nto make an improper use of the messages given. Because they do\nnot wish to listen to the words of reproof, because they will not hear\ncounsel, and improve their course of action, and do their appointed\nwork, they will misconstrue the messages to the church, and confuse\nmany minds.\nNevertheless, I am to bear the message that is given me to bear,\nso long as the Lord shall choose. He has not given me the work\nof settling all the misunderstandings that are cherished in hearts of\nunbelief. Just as long as a door is open to receive the tempter\u2019s [53]\nsuggestions, difficulties will multiply. The hearts of those who will\nnot come to the light are open to unbelief. If my time and strength\nare consumed upon such matters, this serves Satan\u2019s purposes. The\nLord has said to me: \u201cBear the testimonies. Your work is not to settle\ndifficulties; your work is to reprove, and to present the righteousness\nof Christ.\u201d\nAn Incident\nAt one time in the early days of the message, Father Butler and\nElder Hart became confused in regard to the testimonies. In great\ndistress they groaned and wept, but for some time they would not\ngive the reasons for their perplexity. However, being pressed to give\na reason for their faithless speech and manner, Elder Hart referred\nto a small pamphlet that had been published as the visions of Sister\nWhite, and said that to his certain knowledge, some visions were\nnot included. Before a large audience, these brethren both talked\nstrongly about their losing confidence in the work.\nMy husband handed the little pamphlet to Elder Hart, and re-\nquested him to read what was printed on the title page. \u201cA Sketch of\nthe Christian Experience and Views of Mrs. E. G. White\u201c, he read.\nFor a moment there was silence, and then my husband explained\nthat we had been very short of means, and were able to print at\nfirst only a small pamphlet, and he promised the brethren that when\n46 Selected Messages Book 1\nsufficient means was raised, the visions should be published more\nfully in book form.\nElder Butler was deeply moved, and after the explanation had\nbeen made, he said, \u201cLet us bow before God.\u201d Prayers, weeping, and\nconfessions followed, such as we have seldom heard.\nFather Butler said: \u201cBrother White, forgive me; I was afraid\nyou were concealing from us some of the light we ought to have.\nForgive me, Sister White.\u201d Then the power of God came into the\nmeeting in a wonderful manner.\u2014The Writing and Sending Out of\nthe Testimonies to the Church, 3-9.\nThe Work and the Helpers[54]\nSanitarium, California\nOctober 23, 1907\nDear Brother [F . M.] Wilcox,\nI received and read your recent letter. Regarding the sister who\nthinks that she has been chosen to fill the position that Sister White\nhas occupied, I have this to say: She may be honest, but she is\ncertainly deceived.\nAbout a year after the death of my husband, I was very feeble,\nand it was feared that I might live but a short time. At the Healdsburg\ncamp meeting, I was taken into the tent where there was a large\ngathering of our people. I asked to be raised up from the lounged\non which I was lying, and assisted to the speaker\u2019s platform, that\nI might say a few words of farewell to the people. As I tried to\nspeak, the power of God came upon me, and thrilled me through and\nthrough. Many in the congregation observed that I was weak, and\nthat my face and hands seemed bloodless; but as I began speaking\nthey saw the color coming into my lips and face, and knew that a\nmiracle was being wrought in my behalf. I stood before the people\nhealed, and spoke with freedom.\nAfter this experience, light was given me that the Lord had raised\nme up to bear testimony for Him in many countries, and that He\nwould give me grace and strength for the work. It was also shown\nme that my son, W. C. White, should be my helper and counselor,\nand that the Lord would place on him the spirit of wisdom and of a\nsound mind. I was shown that the Lord would guide him, and that\nWriting and Sending Out of the Testimonies to the Church 47\nhe would not be led away, because he would recognize the leadings\nand guidance of the Holy Spirit.\nThe assurance was given me: \u201cYou are not alone in the work\nthe Lord has chosen you to do. You will be taught of God how\nto bring the truth in its simplicity before the people. The God of\ntruth will sustain you, and convincing proof will be given that He\nis leading you. God will give you of His Holy Spirit, and His grace\nand wisdom and keeping power will be with you....\n\u201cThe Lord will be your instructor. You will meet with deceptive [55]\ninfluences; they will come in many forms, in pantheism and other\nforms of infidelity; but follow where I shall guide you, and you will\nbe safe. I will put My Spirit upon your son, and will strengthen him\nto do his work. He has the grace of humility. The Lord has selected\nhim to act an important part in His work. For this purpose was he\nborn.\u201d\nThis word was given me in 1882, and since that time I have been\nassured that the grace of wisdom was given to him. More recently,\nin a time of perplexity, the Lord said: \u201cI have given you My servant,\nW. C. White, and I will give him judgment to be your helper. I will\ngive him skill and understanding to manage wisely.\u201d\nThe Lord has given me other faithful helpers in my work. Many\nof my discourses have been reported, and have been put before\nthe people in printed form. Through nearly the whole of my long\nexperience I have endeavored, day by day, to write out that which\nwas revealed to me in visions of the night. Many messages of counsel\nand reproof and encouragement have been sent out to individuals,\nand much of the instruction that I have received for the church has\nbeen published in periodicals and books, and circulated in many\nlands\nThe work is constantly moving forward. We are making earnest\nefforts to place my writings before the people. We hope that several\nnew books will go to press shortly. If I am incapacitated for labor,\nmy faithful workers are prepared to carry forward the work.\nMy Writings Will Constantly Speak\nAbundant light has been given to our people in these last days.\nWhether or not my life is spared, my writings will constantly speak,\n48 Selected Messages Book 1\nand their work will go forward as long as time shall last. My writings\nare kept on file in the office, and even though I should not live, these\nwords that have been given to me by the Lord will still have life and\nwill speak to the people. But my strength is yet spared, and I hope to\ncontinue to do much useful work. I may live until the coming of the[56]\nLord; but if I should not, I trust it may be said of me, \u201cBlessed are\nthe dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit,\nthat they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow\nthem\u201d (Revelation 14:13)\nI thank God for the assurance of His love, and that I have daily\nHis leading and guidance. I am very busy with my writing. Early\nand late, I am writing out the matters that the Lord opens before me.\nThe burden of my work is to prepare a people to stand in the day of\nthe Lord. The promise of Christ is sure. The time is not long. We\nmust work and watch and wait for the Lord Jesus. We are called\nupon to be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of\nthe Lord. All our hopes have their foundation in Christ.\nAre our people reviewing the past and the present and the future,\nas it is unfolding before the world? Are they heeding the messages\nof warning given them? Is it our greatest concern today that our lives\nshall be refined and purified, and that we shall reflect the similitude\nof the divine? This must be the experience of all who join that\ncompany who are washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb.\nThey must be arrayed in the righteousness of Christ. His name must\nbe written in their foreheads. They must rejoice in the hope of the\nglory of God. Christ has engraved the names of His people on the\npalms of His hands. He will never lose His interest in any dependent\nsoul.\nSay to the church members that there is need of thorough conse-\ncration to God. Let all understand that they must make a covenant\nwith God by sacrifice. We need the blessings of the gospel every day\nand every hour. Every proof of the Lord\u2019s power, His presence, and\nHis love, is to be recognized with grateful thanks. Happiness is to be\nachieved by the right action of the soul toward God. I thank the Lord\nfor this precious thought. Let Him be glorified by the sentiments\nexpressed and by the actions performed.... Never have testimonies\nbeen more clearly brought before the people than those that have\nrecently been traced by my pen. God bids me urge upon the attention[57]\nWriting and Sending Out of the Testimonies to the Church 49\nof our people the importance of their study. Let this work begin now.\nThen, whether I am permitted to labor or am laid away to rest until\nJesus comes, these messages are immortalized.\nTo my brethren I now say: Speak words that will draw souls to\nChrist. Bring forth fruit in good works. \u201cHe that believeth on the\nSon hath everlasting life\u201d (John 3:36). Every conceivable thing will\nbe brought in to deceive, if possible, the very elect; but the Lord will\ncertainly take care of His work.\u2014The Writing and Sending Out of\nthe Testimonies to the Church, 10-16.\nThe Use of the Testimonies\nTime and Place to be Considered\nRegarding the testimonies, nothing is ignored; nothing is cast\naside; but time and place must be considered. Nothing must be done\nuntimely. Some matters must be withheld because some persons\nwould make an improper use of the light given. Every jot and tittle\nis essential and must appear at an opportune time. In the past, the\ntestimonies were carefully prepared before they were sent out for\npublication. And all matter is still carefully studied after the first\nwriting.\nTell them to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of\nGod. Place His Word before them. There will be those who will\nmisinterpret and misrepresent. Their eyes have been blinded, and\nthey set forth the figures and interpretations that Satan has worked\nout for them, and an entirely wrong meaning will be placed upon\nthe words that Sister White has spoken. Satan is just as verily\nclaiming to be Christ\u2019s child as did Judas, who was on the accusing\nside. They have educated themselves in Satan\u2019s school of misstating.\nA description of them is given in the third chapter of Zechariah.\nNothing in the world is so dear to God as His church. Satan has\nworked upon human minds, and will continue to betray sacred trust\nin a spurious way.\nThe Publishing of Compilations [58]\nI can see plainly that should every one who thinks he is qualified\nto write books, follow his imagination and have his productions\n50 Selected Messages Book 1\npublished, insisting that they be recommended by our publishing\nhouses, there would be plenty of tares sown broadcast in our world.\nMany from among our own people are writing to me, asking with\nearnest determination the privilege of using my writings to give\nforce to certain subjects which they wish to present to the people in\nsuch a way as to leave a deep impression upon them.\nIt is true that there is a reason why some of these matters should\nbe presented: but I would not venture to give my approval in using\nthe testimonies in this way, or to sanction the placing of matter which\nis good in itself in the way which they propose.\nThe persons who make these propositions, for aught I know,\nmay be able to conduct the enterprise of which they write in a wise\nmanner; but nevertheless I dare not give the least license for using\nmy writings in the manner which they propose. In taking account\nof such an enterprise, there are many things that must come into\nconsideration; for in using the testimonies to bolster up some subject\nwhich may impress the mind of the author, the extracts may give\na different impression than that which they would were they read\nin their original connection.\u2014The Writing and Sending Out of the\nTestimonies to the Church, 25, 26.\nChapter 5\u2014An Explanation of Early Statements [59]\nAn Answer to a Challenge\n[Soon after the republication in 1882 of the three earliest E. G.\nWhite books, A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of\nEllen G. White, A Supplement to Experience and Views, and\nSpiritual Gifts, vol. 1, all three of which today comprise Early\nWritings, certain questions were raised concerning the completeness\nof some of the articles and the significance of certain statements\nappearing here or in still earlier published articles. Mrs. White\nanswered these questions in 1883 in the following statement.\nReference is made to the teachings on the \u201cshut door.\u201d For another\nreference to the significance of the \u201cshut door\u201d see The Great\nControversy, 429-432.]\nCompilers.\nMy attention has recently been called to a sixteen-page pamphlet\npublished by C, of Marion, Iowa, entitled Comparison of the Early\nWritings of Mrs. White With Later Publications. The writer states\nthat portions of my earlier visions, as first printed, have been sup-\npressed in the work recently published under the title Early Writings\nof Mrs. E. G. White , and he conjectures as a reason for such sup-\npression that these passages teach doctrines now repudiated by us as\na people.\nHe also charges us with willful deception in representing Early\nWritings as a complete republication of my earliest views, with only\nverbal changes from the original work.\nBefore I notice separately the passages which are said to have [60]\nbeen omitted, it is proper that several facts be stated. When my\nearliest views were first published in pamphlet form, [Reference is\nhere made to the 24-page pamphlet \u201cA Word to the Little Flock,\u201d\npublished by James White in 1847, containing three Ellen G. White\ncommunications.\u2014Compilers.] the edition was small, and was soon\n51\n52 Selected Messages Book 1\nsold. This was in a few years followed by a larger book, The Chris-\ntian Experience and Views of Mrs. E. G. White, printed in 1851, and\ncontaining much additional matter.\nIn our frequent change of location in the earlier history of the\npublishing work, and then in almost incessant travel as I have labored\nfrom Maine to Texas, from Michigan to California\u2014and I have\ncrossed the plains no less than seventeen times\u2014I lost all trace of\nthe first published works. When it was decided to publish Early\nWritings at Oakland last fall, we were obliged to send to Michigan\nto borrow a copy of Experience and Views. And in doing this we\nsupposed that we had obtained an exact copy of the earliest visions\nas first published. This we reprinted, as stated in the preface toEarly\nWritings, with only verbal changes from the original work.\nAnd here I will pause to state that any of our people having in\ntheir possession a copy of any or all of my first views, as published\nprior to 1851, will do me a great favor if they will send them to me\nwithout delay. I promise to return the same as soon as a copy can be\nproduced.\nSo far from desiring to withhold anything that I have ever pub-\nlished, I would feel great satisfaction in giving to the public every\nline of my writings that has ever been printed.\nTestimonies Garbled by Eli Curtis\nThere is another fact that should be stated here. I am not respon-\nsible for all that has been printed as coming from me. About the\ntime that my earliest visions were first published, several articles did\nappear purporting to have been written by me, and to relate what\nthe Lord had shown me, but sanctioning doctrines which I did not\nbelieve. These were published in a paper edited by a Mr. Curtis. Of[61]\nthe name of the paper I am not certain. In the years of care and labor\nthat have passed since then, some of these less important particulars\nhave been forgotten, but the main points are still distinct in my mind.\nThis man took articles that came from my pen, and wholly trans-\nformed and distorted them, picking out a sentence here and there,\nwithout giving the connection, and then, after inserting his own\nideas, he attached my name to them as if they came direct from me.\nExplanation of Early Statements 53\nOn seeing these articles, we wrote to him, expressing our surprise\nand disapprobation, and forbidding him thus to misconstrue my\ntestimonies. He answered that he should publish what he pleased,\nthat he knew the visions ought to say what he had published, and\nthat if I had written them as the Lord gave them to me, they would\nhave said these things. He asserted that if the visions have been\ngiven for the benefit of the church, he had a right to use them as he\npleased.\nSome of these sheets may still be in existence, and may be\nbrought forward as coming from me, but I am not responsible for\nthem. The articles given in Early Writings did pass under my eye;\nand as the edition of Experience and Views published in 1851 was\nthe earliest which we possessed, and as we had no knowledge of\nanything additional in papers or pamphlets of earlier date, I am not\nresponsible for the omissions which are said to exist.\nThe First Omission\nThe first quotation mentioned by C is from a pamphlet of twenty-\nfour pages published in 1847, entitled A Word to the Little Flock.\nHere are the lines omitted in Experience and Views:\n\u201cIt was just as impossible for them [those that gave up their faith\nin the \u201844 movement] to get on the path again and go to the city, as\nall the wicked world which God had rejected. They fell all the way\nalong the path one after another.\u201d\nI will give the context, that the full force of the expressions may\nbe clearly seen:\n\u201cWhile praying at the family altar, the Holy Ghost fell on me, [62]\nand I seemed to be rising higher and higher, far above the dark world.\nI turned to look for the advent people in the world, but could not\nfind them\u2014when a voice said to me, \u2018Look again, and look a little\nhigher.\u2019 At this I raised my eyes and saw a straight and narrow path,\ncast up high above the world. On this path the advent people were\ntraveling to the city, which was at the farther end of the path. They\nhad a bright light set up behind them at the first end of the path,\nwhich an angel told me was the midnight cry. This light shone all\nalong the path, and gave light for their feet so they might not stumble.\nAnd if they kept their eyes fixed on Jesus, who was just before them,\n54 Selected Messages Book 1\nleading them to the city, they were safe. But soon some grew weary,\nand they said the city was a great way off, and they expected to have\nentered it before. Then Jesus would encourage them by raising His\nglorious right arm, and from His arm came a glorious light which\nwaved over the advent band, and they shouted, Hallelujah! Others\nrashly denied the light behind them, and said that it was not God\nthat had led them out so far. The light behind them went out, leaving\ntheir feet in perfect darkness, and they stumbled and got their eyes\noff the mark and lost sight of Jesus, and fell off the path down into\nthe dark and wicked world below.\u201d\nNow follows the passage said to be in the original work, but not\nfound in Experience and Views nor in Early Writings:\n\u201cIt was just as impossible for them [those that gave up their faith\nin the \u201844 movement] to get on the path again and go to the city, as\nall the wicked world which God had rejected. They fell all the way\nalong the path one after another.\u201d\nThe \u201cShut Door\u201d Defined\nIt is claimed that these expressions prove the shut-door doctrine,\nand that this is the reason of their omission in later editions. But in\nfact they teach only that which has been and is still held by us as a\npeople, as I shall show.\nFor a time after the disappointment in 1844, I did hold, in com-[63]\nmon with the advent body, that the door of mercy was then forever\nclosed to the world. This position was taken before my first vision\nwas given me. It was the light given me of God that corrected our\nerror, and enabled us to see the true position.\nI am still a believer in the shut-door theory, but not in the sense\nin which we at first employed the term or in which it is employed by\nmy opponents.\nThere was a shut door in Noah\u2019s day. There was at that time a\nwithdrawal of the Spirit of God from the sinful race that perished in\nthe waters of the Flood. God Himself gave the shut-door message to\nNoah:\n\u201cMy spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is\nflesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years\u201d (Genesis\n6:3).\nExplanation of Early Statements 55\nThere was a shut door in the days of Abraham. Mercy ceased\nto plead with the inhabitants of Sodom, and all but Lot, with his\nwife and two daughters, were consumed by the fire sent down from\nheaven.\nThere was a shut door in Christ\u2019s day. The Son of God declared\nto the unbelieving Jews of that generation, \u201cYour house is left unto\nyou desolate\u201d (Matthew 23:38).\nLooking down the stream of time to the last days, the same\ninfinite power proclaimed through John:\n\u201cThese things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath\nthe key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth,\nand no man openeth\u201d (Revelation 3:7).\nI was shown in vision, and I still believe, that there was a shut\ndoor in 1844. All who saw the light of the first and second an-\ngels\u2019 messages and rejected that light, were left in darkness. And\nthose who accepted it and received the Holy Spirit which attended\nthe proclamation of the message from heaven, and who afterward\nrenounced their faith and pronounced their experience a delusion,\nthereby rejected the Spirit of God, and it no longer pleaded with\nthem.\nThose who did not see the light, had not the guilt of its rejection.\nIt was only the class who had despised the light from heaven that [64]\nthe Spirit of God could not reach. And this class included, as I have\nstated, both those who refused to accept the message when it was\npresented to them, and also those who, having received it, afterward\nrenounced their faith. These might have a form of godliness, and\nprofess to be followers of Christ; but having no living connection\nwith God, they would be taken captive by the delusions of Satan.\nThese two classes are brought to view in the vision\u2014those who\ndeclared the light which they had followed a delusion, and the wicked\nof the world who, having rejected the light, had been rejected of\nGod. No reference is made to those who had not seen the light, and\ntherefore were not guilty of its rejection.\nIn order to prove that I believed and taught the shut-door doctrine,\nMr. C gives a quotation from the Review of June 11, 1861, signed\nby nine of our prominent members. The quotation reads as follows:\n\u201cOur views of the work before us were then mostly vague and\nindefinite, some still retaining the idea adopted by the body of advent\n56 Selected Messages Book 1\nbelievers in 1844, with William Miller at their head, that our work\nfor \u2018the world\u2019 was finished, and that the message was confined to\nthose of the original advent faith. So firmly was this believed that\none of our number was nearly refused the message, the individual\npresenting it having doubts of the possibility of his salvation because\nhe was not in \u2018the \u201844 move.\u2019\u201d\nTo this I need only to add, that in the same meeting in which\nit was urged that the message could not be given to this brother, a\ntestimony was given me through vision to encourage him to hope in\nGod and to give his heart fully to Jesus, which he did then and there.\nAn Unreasonable Conjecture\nIn another passage from the book A Word to the Little Flock, I\nspeak of scenes upon the new earth, and state that I there saw holy\nmen of old, \u201cAbraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, Daniel and many like\nthem.\u201d Because I speak of having seen these men, our opponents\nconjecture that I then believed in the immortality of the soul and that\nhaving since changed my views upon this point, I found it necessary[65]\nto suppress that passage. They are as near the truth here as in other\nconjectures.\nIn the year 1844 I accepted the doctrine we now hold, concerning\nthe nonimmortality of the soul, as may be seen by reference to Life\nSketches, pages 170, 171 [1880 edition. See also 1915 edition, 49;\nTestimonies 1:39, 40], and I have never, by voice or pen, advocated\nany other. Had we suppressed this passage on account of its teaching\nthe immortality of the soul, we would have found it necessary to\nsuppress other passages.\nIn relating my first vision, page 13 of Early Writings [1882\nedition, present edition, page 17], I speak of having seen brethren\nwho had but a short time previous fallen asleep in Jesus, and on page\n14 [present edition, pages 18, 19] I state that I was shown a great\ncompany who had suffered martyrdom for their faith.\nThe immortality of the soul is no more taught in the \u201csuppressed\u201d\npassage than in the two last cited.\nThe fact in the case is, that in these visions I was carried forward\nto the time when the resurrected saints shall be gathered into the\nkingdom of God. In the same manner the judgment, the second\nExplanation of Early Statements 57\ncoming of Christ, the establishment of the saints upon the new earth\nhave been presented before me. Does anyone suppose that these\nscenes have yet transpired? My adversaries show the spirit by which\nthey are actuated in thus accusing me of deception on the strength\nof a mere \u201cconjecture.\u201d\nA Misquotation\nIn this quotation are also found the words, \u201cI saw two long\ngolden rods on which hung silver wires, and on the wires were\nglorious grapes.\u201d\nMy opponents ridicule \u201cthat weak and childish expression of\nglorious grapes growing on silver wires, and these wires attached to\ngolden rods.\u201d\nWhat motive impelled the writer of the above to misstate my\nwords? I do not state that grapes were growing on silver wires. That\nwhich I beheld is described as it appeared to me. It is not to be [66]\nsupposed that grapes were attached to silver wires or golden rods,\nbut that such was the appearance presented. Similar expressions are\ndaily employed by every person in ordinary conversation. When we\nspeak of golden fruit, we are not understood as declaring that the\nfruit is composed of that precious metal, but simply that it has the\nappearance of gold. The same rule applied to my words removes all\nexcuse for misapprehension.\nThe Seal of God\nAnother \u201csuppression\u201d reads as follows: \u201cWell, bless the Lord,\nbrethren and sisters, it is an extra meeting for those that have the\nseal of the living God.\u201d\nThere is nothing in this that we do not still hold.

Am I accused of false-\nhood because time has continued longer than my testimony seemed\nto indicate? How is it with the testimonies of Christ and His disci-\nples? Were they deceived?\nPaul writes to the Corinthians:\n\u201cBut this I say, brethren, the time is short : it remaineth, that\nboth they that have wives be as though they had none; and they that\nweep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they\nrejoiced not\u201d (1 Corinthians 7:29, 30).\nAgain, in his epistle to the Romans, he says:\n\u201cThe night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast\noff the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light\u201d\n(Romans 13:12).\nAnd from Patmos, Christ speaks to us by the beloved John:\n\u201cBlessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of\nthis prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for\nthe time is at hand\u201d (Revelation 1:3). \u201cThe Lord God of the holy\nprophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which\nmust shortly be done. Behold, I come quickly; blessed is he that\nExplanation of Early Statements 59\nkeepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book\u201d (Revelation 22:6,\n7).\nThe angels of God in their messages to men represent time as\nvery short. Thus it has always been presented to me. It is true that\ntime has continued longer than we expected in the early days of this\nmessage. Our Saviour did not appear as soon as we hoped. But has\nthe word of the Lord failed? Never! It should be remembered that\nthe promises and threatenings of God are alike conditional.\nGod had committed to His people a work to be accomplished\non earth. The third angel\u2019s message was to be given, the minds of\nbelievers were to be directed to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ\nhad entered to make atonement for His people. The Sabbath reform\nwas to be carried forward. The breach in the law of God must be [68]\nmade up. The message must be proclaimed with a loud voice, that\nall the inhabitants of earth might receive the warning. The people of\nGod must purify their souls through obedience to the truth, and be\nprepared to stand without fault before Him at His coming.\nHad Adventists, after the great disappointment in 1844, held fast\ntheir faith, and followed on unitedly in the opening providence of\nGod, receiving the message of the third angel and in the power of\nthe Holy Spirit proclaiming it to the world, they would have seen\nthe salvation of God, the Lord would have wrought mightily with\ntheir efforts, the work would have been completed, and Christ would\nhave come ere this to receive His people to their reward.\nBut in the period of doubt and uncertainty that followed the\ndisappointment, many of the advent believers yielded their faith.\nDissensions and divisions came in. The majority opposed with voice\nand pen the few who, following in the providence of God, received\nthe Sabbath reform and began to proclaim the third angel\u2019s message.\nMany who should have devoted their time and talents to the one pur-\npose of sounding warning to the world, were absorbed in opposing\nthe Sabbath truth, and in turn, the labor of its advocates was neces-\nsarily spent in answering these opponents and defending the truth.\nThus the work was hindered, and the world was left in darkness.\nHad the whole Adventist body united upon the commandments of\nGod and the faith of Jesus, how widely different would have been\nour history!\n60 Selected Messages Book 1\nIt was not the will of God that the coming of Christ should be\nthus delayed. God did not design that His people, Israel, should\nwander forty years in the wilderness. He promised to lead them\ndirectly to the land of Canaan, and establish them there a holy,\nhealthy, happy people. But those to whom it was first preached,\nwent not in \u201cbecause of unbelief\u201d (Hebrews 3:19). Their hearts were\nfilled with murmuring, rebellion, and hatred, and He could not fulfill\nHis covenant with them.\nFor forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out[69]\nancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have delayed\nthe entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In neither\ncase were the promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the world-\nliness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord\u2019s professed people\nthat have kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many years.\nThere are two other passages said to be found in my first book,\nbut not given in my later writings. Concerning these I shall only say,\nwhen I can obtain a book containing them, so that I can be assured\nof the correctness of the quotations and can see for myself their\nconnection, I shall be prepared to speak understandingly in regard\nto them.\nLast-Day Scoffers\nFrom the beginning of my work, I have been pursued by hatred,\nreproach, and falsehood. Base imputations and slanderous reports\nhave been greedily gathered up and widely circulated by the re-\nbellious, the formalist, and the fanatic. There are ministers of the\nso-called orthodox churches traveling from place to place to war\nagainst Seventh-day Adventists, and they make Mrs. White their\ntextbook. The scoffers of the last days are led on by these ministers\nprofessing to be God\u2019s watchmen.\nThe unbelieving world, the ministers of the fallen churches, and\nthe first-day Adventists are united in the work of assailing Mrs.\nWhite. This warfare has been kept up for nearly forty years, but I\nhave not felt at liberty even to notice their vile speeches, reproaches,\nand insinuations. And I would not now depart from this custom,\nwere it not that some honest souls may be misled by the enemies of\nExplanation of Early Statements 61\nthe truth who are so exultantly declaring me a deceiver. In the hope\nof helping the minds of the honest, I make the statements that I do.\nI do not expect to reach those who, having seen the light of truth,\nrefuse to heed it, those who have given themselves up to prejudice,\nand entrenched their souls in unbelief.\nJesus, the Majesty of heaven, He who was equal with God, was [70]\nin the world thirty-three years, and yet there were but few who\nacknowledged His divine character. And can I, who am so weak, so\nunworthy, a frail creature of humanity, expect greater success than\nwas enjoyed by the Saviour of the world?\nWhen I first gave myself to this work, to go when God should\nbid me, to speak the words which He should give me for the people,\nI knew that I should receive opposition, reproach, persecution. I\nhave not been disappointed. Had I depended on human applause, I\nwould long ago have become discouraged. But I looked to Jesus,\nand saw that He who was without a fault was assailed by slanderous\ntongues. Those who made high pretensions to godliness followed\nas spies upon the Saviour\u2019s course, and made every exertion in their\npower to hedge up His way. But although He was all-powerful,\nHe did not visit His adversaries as their sins deserved. He might\nhave launched forth against them the bolts of His vengeance, but\nHe did not. He administered scathing rebukes for their hypocrisy\nand corruption, and when His message was rejected and His life\nthreatened, He quietly passed to another place to speak the words\nof life. I have tried, in my weakness, to follow the example of my\nSaviour.\nEnmity Against Advocates of Truth\nHow eagerly the Pharisees sought to prove Christ a deceiver!\nHow they watched His every word, seeking to misrepresent and\nmisinterpret all His sayings! Pride and prejudice and passion closed\nevery avenue of the soul against the testimony of the Son of God.\nWhen He plainly rebuked their iniquity and declared that their works\nproved them to be the children of Satan, they angrily flung back the\naccusation, saying, \u201cSay we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and\nhast a devil?\u201d\n62 Selected Messages Book 1\nAll the arguments urged against Christ were founded in false-\nhood. So was it in the case of Stephen, and of Paul. But the weakest\nand most unreliable statements made on the wrong side had an influ-\nence, because there were so many whose hearts were unsanctified,\nwho desired those statements to be true. Such are ever eager to[71]\nfasten upon any supposed error or mistake in those who speak to\nthem the unpalatable truth.\nIt should not surprise us when evil conjectures are greedily seized\nupon as undoubted facts by those who have an appetite for falsehood.\nThe opposers of Christ were again and again confounded and put to\nsilence by the wisdom of His words; yet they still eagerly listened\nto every rumor, and found some pretext to ply Him again with\nopposing questions. They were determined not to abandon their\npurpose. They well knew that if Jesus should continue His work,\nmany would believe on Him, and the scribes and Pharisees would\nlose their power with the people. Hence they were ready to stoop\nto any base or contemptible measure to accomplish their malicious\nintentions against Him. They hated the Herodians, yet they joined\nthese inveterate enemies in order to invent some plan to rid the earth\nof Christ.\nSuch was the spirit with which the Son of God was met by those\nwhom He came to save. Can any who are seeking to obey God,\nand to bear to the world the message of His truth, expect a more\nfavorable reception than was granted Christ?\nI have no ill will toward those who are seeking to make of\nnone effect the message which God has given to reprove, warn,\nand encourage His people. But as the ambassador of Christ, I must\nstand in defense of the truth. Who are those that so zealously array\nthemselves against me? Are they the pure and holy children of\nfaith? Have they been born again? Are they partakers of the divine\nnature? Do they love Jesus, and manifest His spirit of meekness\nand humility? \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them\u201d (Matthew 7:20).\nDo they resemble the early disciples, or those cunning scribes and\nPharisees who were constantly watching to entrap Christ in His\nwords? Notice the sharp practice of those ancient opposers of the\nfaith\u2014how lawyers, priests, scribes, and rulers combined to find\nsomething against Him who was the light of the world.\nAnd why were they so intent upon condemning Christ? They[72]\nExplanation of Early Statements 63\ndid not love His doctrines and precepts, and they were displeased as\nthey saw the attention of the people turned to Him and away from\ntheir former leaders.\nHuman nature is human nature still. Let not those who seek to\nhedge up my way and destroy the influence of my words, deceive\nthemselves with the belief that they are doing God service. They are\nserving another master, and they will be rewarded according to their\nwork.\nRebellion will exist as long as Satan exists. Those who are\nactuated by his spirit will not discern the spirit of God or listen to its\nvoice until the mandate shall go forth, \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be\nunjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that\nis righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be\nholy still\u201d (Revelation 22:11). I expect to encounter the malice of\nthose who despise the light which God has been pleased to give me.\nSufficient Evidence for the Honest in Heart\nIt is God\u2019s plan to give sufficient evidence of the divine character\nof His work to convince all who honestly desire to know the truth.\nBut He never removes all opportunity for doubt. All who desire to\nquestion and cavil will find occasion.\nI pity those who have set their feet in the path of doubt and\nunbelief. I would gladly help them if I could, but the experience of\nthe past gives me little hope that they will ever come to the light.\nNo amount of evidence will convince men of the truth so long as\nthey are unwilling to yield their pride, subdue their carnal nature,\nand become learners in the school of Christ.\nSelf-will and pride of opinion lead many to reject the light from\nheaven They cling to pet ideas, fanciful interpretations of Scripture,\nand dangerous heresies; and if a testimony is borne to correct these\nerrors, they will, like many in Christ\u2019s day, go away displeased.\nIt matters not how blameless the character and life of those who\nspeak to the people the words of God; this procures for them no\ncredit. And why? Because they tell the people the truth. This, [73]\nbrethren, is my offense. But if a false report is circulated, if by some\ninference or conjecture an imputation is cast upon the character\nof Christ\u2019s ambassador, with what absurd credulity is it received!\n64 Selected Messages Book 1\nHow many are ready to magnify and spread the slander! Such are\nrevealing their real character. \u201cHe that is of God heareth God\u2019s\nwords: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God\u201d (John\n8:47).\nCalumny and reproach will be the recompense of those who\nstand for the truth as it is in Jesus. \u201cAll that will live godly in Christ\nJesus shall suffer persecution\u201d (2 Timothy 3:12). Those who bear a\nplain testimony against sin will as surely be hated as was the Master\nwho gave them this work to do in His name. Like Christ, they will\nbe called the enemies of the church and of religion, and the more\nearnest and true their efforts to honor God, the more bitter will be\nthe enmity of the ungodly and hypocritical. But we should not be\ndiscouraged when thus treated.\nI Shall Go Forward With My Work\nWe may be called \u201cweak and foolish,\u201d enthusiastic, even insane.\nIt may be said of us as it was of Christ, \u201cHe hath a devil\u201d (John\n10:20). But the work which the Master has given us to do is our\nwork still. We must direct minds to Jesus, not seeking praise or honor\nof men, but committing ourselves to Him who judgeth righteously.\nHe knows how to help those who while following in His steps suffer\nin a limited degree the reproach He bore. He was tempted in all\npoints like as we are, that He might know how to succor those who\nshould be tempted.\nWhatever wrong construction may be placed upon my testimony\nby those who profess righteousness, yet know not God, I shall in\nhumility go forward with my work. I will speak the words which\nGod gives me to speak in encouragement, reproof, and warning.\nThere remains but a little remnant of my life on earth.

The\nstatements in reference to my course in forty-four are false.\nWith my brethren and sisters, after the time passed in forty-four\nI did believe no more sinners would be converted. But I never had a\nvision that no more sinners would be converted. And am clear and\nfree to state no one has ever heard me say or has read from my pen\nstatements which will justify them in the charges they have made\nagainst me upon this point.\nIt was on my first journey east to relate my visions that the\nprecious light in regard to the heavenly sanctuary was opened before\nme and I was shown the open and shut door. We believed that the\nLord was soon to come in the clouds of heaven. I was shown that\nthere was a great work to be done in the world for those who had\nnot had the light and rejected it. Our brethren could not understand\nthis with our faith in the immediate appearing of Christ. Some\naccused me of saying that my Lord delayeth His coming, especially\nthe fanatical ones. I saw that in \u201844 God had opened a door and\nno man could shut it, and shut a door and no man could open it.\nThose who rejected the light which was brought to the world by the\nmessage of the second angel went into darkness, and how great was\nthat darkness.\nI never have stated or written that the world was doomed or\ndamned.

Their argument is that this statement of yours will\nnot stand the Bible test; as Christ Himself declares that no man\nknoweth the day or the hour, no not even the angels of God.\u201d\nIn my first book you will find the only statement in regard to the\nday and hour of Christ\u2019s coming that I have made since the passing\nof the time in 1844. It is found in Early Writings, 11, 27, 145, 146\n[15, 34, and 285, present edition]. All refer to the announcement\nthat will be made just before the second coming of Christ.\nBy turning to page 145 [page 285, present edition] and reading\nfrom the commencement of the chapter you will see that the state-\nments made refer to the deliverance of the saints from the time of\ntrouble by the voice of God. Please obtain this book if you do not\nhave it, and read the statements therein. They are just as printed\nfrom the first article published. \u201cThe sky opened and shut, and was\nin commotion.\u201d \u201cThe mountains shook like a reed in the wind, and\ncast out ragged rocks all around. The sea boiled like a pot, and cast\nout stones upon the ground. And as God spoke the day and hour of\nJesus\u2019 coming, and delivered the everlasting covenant to His people,\nHe spoke one sentence and then paused while the words were rolling\nthrough the earth.\u201d\nThis is a portion of the paragraph. The statements in pages 11\nand 27 [pages 15 and 34, present edition] refer to the same time.\nThey contain all that I have ever been shown in regard to the definite\ntime of the Lord\u2019s coming. I have not the slightest knowledge as to[76]\nthe time spoken by the voice of God. I heard the hour proclaimed,\nbut had no remembrance of that hour after I came out of vision.\nScenes of such thrilling, solemn interest passed before me as no\nlanguage is adequate to describe.

I was in vision taken to heaven, and the angel said\nto me, \u201cLook!\u201d I looked to the world as it was in dense darkness. The\nagony that came over me was indescribable as I saw this darkness.\nExplanation of Early Statements 67\nAgain the word came, \u201cLook ye.\u201d And again I looked intensely\nover the world, and I began to see jets of light like stars dotted all\nthrough this darkness; and then I saw another and another added\nlight, and so all through this moral darkness the star-like lights were\nincreasing. And the angel said, \u201cThese are they that believe on the\nLord Jesus Christ, and are obeying the words of Christ. These are the\nlight of the world; and if it were not for these lights, the judgments\nof God would immediately fall upon the transgressors of God\u2019s law.\u201d\nI saw then these little jets of light growing brighter, shining forth\nfrom the east and the west, from the north and the south, and lighting\nthe whole world.\nOccasionally one of these lights would begin to grow dim, and\nothers would go out, and every time this occurred there was sadness\nand weeping in heaven. And some of the lights would grow brighter\nand brighter, and their brightness was far-reaching, and many more\nlights were added to it. Then there was rejoicing in heaven.

As I read the Word of God and kneel\nin prayer, I am so impressed with the goodness and mercy of God\nthat I cannot offer my petition without weeping. My heart is subdued\nand broken as I think of my heavenly Father\u2019s goodness and love. I\nhunger and thirst for more and still more of Jesus in this life. Christ\nwas crucified for me, and shall I complain if I am crucified with\nChrist?...\nWe know not what is before us, and our only safety is in walking\nwith Christ, our hand in His, our hearts filled with perfect trust. Has\nHe not said, \u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make\npeace with me; and he shall make peace with me\u201d? Let us keep\nclose to the Saviour. Let us walk humbly with Him, filled with His\nmeekness. Let self be hid with Him in God....\nThe Outward Adorning\nThose who cherish and flatter self, fostering pride and vanity,\ngiving to dress and appearance the time and attention that ought to [80]\nbe given to the Master\u2019s work, are incurring a fearful loss. Many\nwho are clothed in beautiful outward garments know nothing of the\ninward adorning that is in the sight of God of great price. Their fine\nclothing covers a heart that is sinful and diseased, full of vanity and\npride. They know not what it means to \u201cseek those things which are\nabove, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God\u201d (Colossians\n3:1).\nI long to be filled day by day with the Spirit of Christ. The\ntreasure of His grace is of more value to me than gold or silver or\ncostly array. I never felt a more earnest longing for righteousness\nthan at the present time.\n71\n72 Selected Messages Book 1\nWhen my sisters catch a glimpse of what Christ has suffered in\ntheir behalf, that they might become children of God by adoption,\nthey will no longer be satisfied with worldly pride and self-love.\nNo longer will they worship self. God will be the object of their\nsupreme regard.\nMy heart aches as I am shown how many there are who make\nself their idol. Christ has paid the redemption price for them. To\nHim belongs the service of all their powers. But their hearts are filled\nwith self-love, and the desire for self-adorning. They give no thought\nto the words, \u201cWhosoever will come after me, let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow me\u201d (Mark 8:34). Self-gratification\nis hiding Christ from their view. They have no desire to walk before\nGod in meekness and lowliness. They are not looking to Jesus. They\nare not praying that they may be changed into His likeness. Their\ncases are represented by the man who came to the king\u2019s banquet\nclothed in his common citizen dress. He had refused to make the\npreparation required by the king. The garment provided for him\nat great cost he disdained to wear. To the king\u2019s demand, \u201cHow\ncamest thou in hither not having a wedding garment?\u201d (Matthew\n22:12) he could answer nothing. He was speechless; for he was\nself-condemned.\nMany who profess to be Christians are such only in name. They\nare not converted. They keep self prominent. They do not sit at the\nfeet of Jesus, as Mary did, to learn of Him. They are not ready for\nChrist\u2019s coming.\nA Great Surprise[81]\nIn the night season I was in a company of people whose hearts\nwere filled with vanity and conceit. Christ was hid from their eyes.\nSuddenly in loud, clear accents, the words were heard, \u201cJesus is\ncoming to take to Himself those who on this earth have loved and\nserved Him, to be with Him in His kingdom forever.\u201d Many of those\nin the company went forth in their costly apparel to meet Him. They\nkept looking at their dress. But when they saw His glory, and realized\nthat their estimation of one another had been so largely measured\nby outward appearance, they knew that they were without the robe\nLoving Watchcare of Jesus 73\nof Christ\u2019s righteousness, and that the blood of souls was on their\ngarments.\nWhen Christ took His chosen ones, they were left; for they were\nnot ready. In their lives self had been given the first place, and when\nthe Saviour came, they were not prepared to meet Him.\nI awoke with the picture of their agonized countenances stamped\non my mind. I cannot efface the impression. I wish I could describe\nthe scene as it was presented to me. Oh, how sad was the disap-\npointment of those who had not learned by experience the meaning\nof the words, \u201cYe are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God\u201d\n(Colossians 3:3).\nThere are many professing Christians who know not Christ by\nan experimental knowledge. Oh, how my heart aches for these poor,\ndeceived, unprepared souls! As I stand before congregations, and\nsee the self-sufficient, self-righteous ones, and know that they are\nnot preparing themselves to do acceptable work for Christ, and to\nmeet Him in peace, I am so burdened that I cannot sleep. I ask\nmyself, What can I say to these souls that will arouse them to a sense\nof their true condition? Self is the all-absorbing theme of their life. I\nlong to reveal Christ so plainly that they will behold Him, and cease\nto center their attention on self....\nAmong those to whom bitter disappointment will come at the day\nof final reckoning will be some who have been outwardly religious, [82]\nand who apparently have lived Christian lives. But self is woven into\nall they do. They pride themselves on their morality, their influence,\ntheir ability to stand in a higher position than others, [and] their\nknowledge of the truth, for they think that these will win for them\nthe commendation of Christ. \u201cLord,\u201d they plead, \u201cwe have eaten\nand drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets\u201d (Luke\n13:26). \u201cHave we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name\nhave cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?\u201d\n(Matthew 7:22).\nBut Christ says, \u201cI tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart\nfrom me.\u201d \u201cNot every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter\ninto the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father\nwhich is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 7:21).\nThere is no discussion; the time for that is past.

They of Capernaum\nreceived Him, and among them He wrought wonderful miracles.\nChrist has all power in heaven and in earth. He is the Great\nPhysician, upon whom we are to call when suffering from physical\nor spiritual disease. Over the winds and the waves and over men\npossessed with demons, He showed that He possessed absolute\ncontrol. To Him have been given the keys of death and of hell.\nPrincipalities and powers were made subject to Him, even while in\nHis humiliation....\nWhy do we not exercise greater faith in the Divine Physician?\nAs He worked for the man with the palsy, so He will work today for\nthose who come to Him for healing. We have great need of more\nfaith. I am alarmed as I see the lack of faith among our people. We\nneed to come right into the presence of Christ, believing that He will\nheal our physical and spiritual infirmities.\nWe are too faithless. Oh, how I wish that I could lead our people\nto have faith in God! They need not feel that in order to exercise\nfaith they must be wrought up into a high state of excitement. All [84]\nthey have to do is to believe God\u2019s Word, just as they believe one\nanother\u2019s word. He hath said it, and He will perform His Word.\nCalmly rely on His promise, because He means all that He says. Say,\nHe has spoken to me in His Word, and He will fulfill every promise\nthat He has made. Do not become restless. Be trustful. God\u2019s Word\nis true. Act as if your heavenly Father could be trusted....\nMen are appointed to proclaim the truth in new places. These\nmen must have funds for their support. And they must have a fund\nto draw upon for the help of the poor and needy whom they meet in\ntheir work. The benevolence that they show toward the poor gives\ninfluence to their efforts to proclaim the truth. Their willingness to\n75\n76 Selected Messages Book 1\nhelp those in need gains for them the gratitude of those they help,\nand the approval of Heaven.\nThese faithful workers should have the sympathies of the church.\nThe Lord will hear prayer in their behalf. And the church should not\nfail to show a practical interest in their work.\nNo one lives to himself. In God\u2019s work each one is assigned a\npost of duty. The union of all strengthens the work of each. As the\nfaith and love and unity of the church grow stronger their circle of\ninfluence enlarges, and ever they are to reach to the farthest limit of\nthis influence, constantly extending the triumphs of the cross.\nArise, Shine\nGod calls upon us to burst the bands of our precise, indoor\nservice. The message of the gospel is to be borne in the cities and\noutside of the cities. We are to call upon all to rally around the\nbanner of the cross. When this work is done as it should be, when\nwe labor with divine zeal to add converts to the truth, the world\nwill see that a power attends the message of truth. The unity of the\nbelievers bears testimony to the power of the truth that can bring\ninto perfect harmony men of different dispositions, making their\ninterests one.\nThe prayers and offerings of the believers are combined with[85]\nearnest, self-sacrificing efforts, and they are indeed a spectacle to\nthe world, to angels, and to men. Men are converted anew. The hand\nthat once grasped for recompense in higher wages has become the\nhelping hand of God. The believers are united by one interest\u2014the\ndesire to make centers of truth where God shall be exalted. Christ\njoins them together in holy bonds of union and love, bonds which\nhave irresistible power.\nIt was for this unity that Jesus prayed just before His trial, stand-\ning but a step from the cross. \u201cThat they all may be one;\u201d He said,\n\u201cas thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in\nus: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me\u201d (John 17:21).\nGod calls upon those who are half awake to arouse, and engage\nin earnest labor, praying to Him for strength for service. Workers\nare needed. It is not necessary to follow rules of exact precision.\nReceive the Holy Spirit, and your efforts will be successful. Christ\u2019s\nChrist Holds Control 77\npresence is that which gives power. Let all dissension and strife\ncease. Let love and unity prevail. Let all move under the guidance\nof the Holy Spirit.

The Lord loves us,\nand He will perform His word. Try to encourage in the patients a\ntrust in God. Bid them be of good courage. Talk hope, even to the\nlast. If they are to die, let them die praising the Lord. He ever lives;\nand though some of His faithful followers may fall in death, their\nworks will follow them, and theirs will be a joyous awakening in the\nresurrection morning.\nLet us not be discouraged. Let us not talk doubt, but faith; for\nfaith brings infinite power. If we lay hold upon this power, and do\nnot trust in our own human strength, we shall see the salvation of\nGod.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 30, 1909.\nChapter 8\u2014Willing to Spend and Be Spent[86]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 3.]\nHe who loves God supremely and his neighbor as himself will\nwork with the constant realization that he is a spectacle to the world,\nto angels, and to men. Making God\u2019s will his will, he will reveal\nin his life the transforming power of the grace of Christ. In all the\ncircumstances of life, he will take Christ\u2019s example as his guide.\nEvery true, self-sacrificing worker for God is willing to spend\nand be spent for the sake of others. Christ says, \u201cHe that loveth his\nlife shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep\nit unto life eternal\u201d (John 12:25). By earnest, thoughtful efforts to\nhelp where help is needed, the true Christian shows his love for God\nand for his fellow beings. He may lose his life in service. But when\nChrist comes to gather His jewels to Himself, he will find it again.\nMy brethren and sisters, do not spend a large amount of time\nand money on self, for the sake of appearance. Those who do this\nare obliged to leave undone many things that would have comforted\nothers, sending a warm glow to their weary spirits. We all need to\nlearn how to improve more faithfully the opportunities that so often\ncome to us to bring light and hope into the lives of others. How can\nwe improve these opportunities if our thoughts are centered upon[87]\nself? He who is self-centered loses countless opportunities for doing\nthat which would have brought blessing to others and to himself. It\nis the duty of the servant of Christ, under every circumstance, to ask\nhimself, \u201cWhat can I do to help others?\u201d Having done his best, he is\nto leave the consequences with God.\nI desire so to live that in the future life I can feel that during this\nlife I did what I could. God has provided for every one pleasure\nthat may be enjoyed by rich and poor alike\u2014the pleasure found\nin cultivating pureness of thought and unselfishness of action, the\npleasure that comes from speaking sympathizing words and doing\n78\nWilling to Spend and Be Spent 79\nkindly deeds. From those who perform such service the light of\nChrist shines to brighten lives darkened by many shadows.\nGod is dishonored when we fail to speak the truth plainly to one\nanother. But we are to speak the truth in love, bringing tenderness\nand sympathy into our voices.\nThe perils of the last days are upon us. Those who live to\nplease and gratify self are dishonoring the Lord. He cannot work\nthrough them, for they would misrepresent Him before those who\nare ignorant of the truth. Be very careful not to hinder, by an unwise\nexpenditure of means, the work that the Lord would have done in\nproclaiming the warning message to a world lying in wickedness.\nStudy economy, cutting down your personal expense to the lowest\npossible figure. On every hand the necessities of the cause of God\nare calling for help. God may see that you are fostering pride. He\nmay see that it is necessary to remove from you blessings which,\ninstead of improving, you have used for the gratification of selfish\npride....\nHelp in Every Time of Need\nThose who are laboring in places where the work has not long\nbeen started, will often find themselves in great need of better facili-\nties. Their work will seem to be hindered for lack of these facilities;\nbut let them not worry. Let them take the whole matter to the Lord\nin prayer. When trying to build up the work in new territory, we\nhave often gone to the limit of our resources. At times it seemed as [88]\nif we could not advance farther. But we kept our petitions ascending\nto the heavenly courts, all the time denying self; and God heard and\nanswered our prayers, sending us means for the advancement of the\nwork.\nLay every care at the feet of the Redeemer. \u201cAsk, and ye shall\nreceive\u201d (John 16:24). Work, and pray, and believe with the whole\nheart. Do not wait until the money is in your hands before doing\nanything. Walk out by faith. God has declared that the standard of\ntruth is to be planted in many places. Learn to believe, as you pray\nto God for help. Practice self-denial; for Christ\u2019s whole life on this\nearth was one of self-denial. He came to show us what we must be\nand do in order to gain eternal life.\n80 Selected Messages Book 1\nDo your best, and then wait, patiently, hopefully, rejoicingly,\nbecause the promise of God cannot fail. Failure comes because many\nwho could put their means into circulation for the advancement of\nGod\u2019s work are lacking in faith. The longer they withhold their\nmeans, the less faith they will have. They are barrier builders, who\nfearfully retard the work of God.\nMy dear fellow workers, be true, hopeful, heroic. Let every blow\nbe made in faith. As you do your best, the Lord will reward your\nfaithfulness. From the life-giving fountain draw physical, mental,\nand spiritual energy. Manliness, womanliness\u2014sanctified, purified,\nrefined, ennobled\u2014we have the promise of receiving. We need\nthat faith which will enable us to endure the seeing of Him who is\ninvisible. As you fix your eyes upon Him, you will be filled with a\ndeep love for the souls for whom He died, and will receive strength\nfor renewed effort.\nChrist is our only hope. Come to God in the name of Him who\ngave His life for the world. Rely upon the efficacy of His sacrifice.\nShow that His love, His joy, is in your soul, and that because of\nthis your joy is full. Cease to talk unbelief. In God is our strength.\nPray much. Prayer is the life of soul. The prayer of faith is the\nweapon by which we may successfully resist every assault of the\nenemy.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1904.\nChapter 9\u2014Examine Yourselves [89]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 12.]\n\u201cExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your\nown selves\u201d (2 Corinthians 13:5). Closely criticize the temper, the\ndisposition, the thoughts, words, inclinations, purposes, and deeds.\nHow can we ask intelligently for the things we need unless we prove\nby the Scriptures the condition of our spiritual health?\nMany in their religious life are making crooked paths for their\nfeet. Their prayers are offered in a loose, haphazard manner. He\nwho is placed in a position of responsibility should remember that\nof himself he is not able to do that which is required of him. Every\nday he should remember that he is a spectacle unto the world, to\nangels, and to men.\nNo one is to wait to be borne to fields of labor and provided with\ncostly facilities for doing good. He who serves must cheerfully take\nup his work, however humble it is, and wherever he may be placed.\nChrist, our example in all things, was poor, that through His poverty\nHe might make many rich.\nHe whose heart is filled with the grace of God and love for his\nperishing fellow men will find opportunity, wherever he may be [90]\nplaced, to speak a word in season to those who are weary. Christians\nare to work for their Master in meekness and lowliness, holding fast\nto their integrity amid the noise and bustle of life.\nGod calls upon men to serve Him in every transaction of life.\nBusiness is a snare when the law of God is not made the law of the\ndaily life. He who has anything to do with the Master\u2019s work is to\nmaintain unswerving integrity. In all business transactions, as verily\nas when on bended knees he seeks help from on high, God\u2019s will is\nto be his will. He is to keep the Lord ever before him, constantly\nstudying the subjects about which the Holy Word speaks. Thus,\nthough living amid that which would debase a man of lax principles,\nthe man of piety and stern integrity preserves his Christianity.\n81\n82 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe world is no more favorable today for the development of\nChristian character than in Noah\u2019s day.

God has chosen a people and made them the repositories of\ntruth weighty with eternal results. To them has been given the light\nthat must illuminate the world. Has God made a mistake?

Are we the men and women\nwho are to bear to the world the messages of Revelation fourteen, to\nproclaim the message of salvation to those who are standing on the\nbrink of ruin?

Notwithstanding that the signs of the times\nare fulfilling all over the world, faith in the Lord\u2019s coming has been\ngrowing feeble.

We are called laborers together\nwith God. Then let us arise and shine. There is no time to spend\nin controversy. Those who have a knowledge of the truth as it is in\nJesus must now become one in heart and purpose. All differences\nmust be swept away. The members of the church must work unitedly\nunder the great Head of the church.\nLet those who have a knowledge of the truth arise and shine.\n\u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet\u201d (Isaiah 58:1).\nNo longer mutilate the truth.

For we have\nnot an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our\ninfirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without\nsin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we\nmay obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need\u201d (Hebrews\n4:14-16).\u2014Manuscript 51, 1901.\nChapter 10\u2014Good Angels More Powerful Than[94]\nEvil Angels\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 15.]\nIt is expressly stated that Satan works in the children of disobedi-\nence, not merely having access to their minds, but working through\ntheir influence, conscious and unconscious, to draw others into the\nsame disobedience. If evil angels have such power over the children\nof men in their disobedience, how much greater power the good\nangels have over those who are striving to be obedient. When we\nput our trust in Jesus Christ, working obedience unto righteousness,\nangels of God work in our hearts unto righteousness.. . .\nAngels came and ministered to our Lord in the wilderness of\ntemptation. Heavenly angels were with Him during all the period\nin which He was exposed to the assaults of satanic agencies. These\nassaults were more severe than man has ever passed through. Ev-\nerything was at stake in behalf of the human family. In this conflict\nChrist did not frame His words even. He depended upon \u201cIt is writ-\nten\u201d (Matthew 4:4). In this conflict the humanity of Christ was taxed\nas none of us will ever know. The Prince of life and the prince of\ndarkness met in terrible conflict, but Satan was unable to gain the\nleast advantage in word or in action. These were real temptations, no[95]\npretense. Christ \u201csuffered being tempted\u201d (Hebrews 2:18). Angels\nof heaven were on the scene on that occasion, and kept the standard\nuplifted, that Satan should not exceed his bounds and overpower the\nhuman nature of Christ.\nIn the last temptation Satan presented to Christ the prospect of\ngaining the whole world with all its glory if He would only worship\nhim who claimed to be sent of God. Christ must then issue His\ncommand. He must then exercise authority above all satanic agen-\ncies. Divinity flashed through humanity, and Satan was peremptorily\nrepulsed. \u201cGet thee hence, Satan,\u201d Christ said, \u201cfor it is written,\n86\nGood Angels More Powerful Than Evil Angels 87\nThou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\u201d\n(Matthew 4:10).\nIt was enough. Satan could go no further. Angels ministered to\nthe Saviour. Angels brought Him food. The severity of this conflict\nno human mind can compass. The welfare of the whole human\nfamily and of Christ Himself was at stake. One admission from\nChrist, one word of concession, and the world would be claimed by\nSatan as his; and he, the prince of the power of darkness, would, he\nsupposed, commence his rule. There appeared unto Christ an angel\nfrom heaven; for the conflict ended. Human power was ready to fail.\nBut all heaven sang the song of eternal victory.\nThe human family have all the help that Christ had in their\nconflicts with Satan. They need not be overcome. They may be\nmore than conquerors through Him who has loved them and given\nHis life for them. \u201cYe are bought with a price\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:20).\nAnd what a price! The Son of God in His humanity wrestled with\nthe very same fierce, apparently overwhelming temptations that\nassail men\u2014temptations to indulgence of appetite, to presumptuous\nventuring where God has not led them, and to the worship of the\ngod of this world, to sacrifice an eternity of bliss for the fascinating\npleasures of this life. Everyone will be tempted, but the Word\ndeclares that we shall not be tempted above our ability to bear. We\nmay resist and defeat the wily foe.\nA Heaven to Win [96]\nEvery soul has a heaven to win, and a hell to shun. And the\nangelic agencies are all ready to come to the help of the tried and\ntempted soul. He, the Son of the infinite God, endured the test\nand trial in our behalf. The cross of Calvary stands vividly before\nevery soul. When the cases of all are judged, and they [the lost] are\ndelivered to suffer for their contempt for God and their disregard of\nHis honor in their disobedience, not one will have an excuse, not\none will need to have perished. It was left to their own choice who\nshould be their prince, Christ or Satan. All the help Christ received,\nevery man may receive in the great trial. The cross stands as a pledge\nthat not one need be lost, that abundant help is provided for every\nsoul. We can conquer the satanic agencies, or we can join ourselves\n88 Selected Messages Book 1\nwith the powers that seek to counterwork the work of God in our\nworld.. . .\nWe have an Advocate pleading in our behalf. The Holy Ghost\nis continually engaged in beholding our course of action. We need\nnow keen perception, that by our own practical godliness the truth\nmay be made to appear truth as it is in Jesus. The angelic agencies\nare messengers from heaven, actually ascending and descending,\nkeeping earth in constant connection with the heaven above. These\nangel messengers are observing all our course of action. They are\nready to help all in their weakness, guarding all from moral and\nphysical danger according to the providence of God. And whenever\nsouls yield to the softening, subduing influence of the Spirit of God\nunder these angel ministrations, there is joy in heaven; the Lord\nHimself rejoices with singing.\nMen take altogether too much glory to themselves. It is the work\nof heavenly agencies cooperating with human agencies according to\nGod\u2019s plan that brings the result in the conversion and sanctification\nof the human character. We cannot see and could not endure the glory\nof angelic ministrations if their glory was not veiled in condescension\nto the weakness of our human nature. The blaze of the heavenly[97]\nglory, as seen in the angels of light, would extinguish earthly mortals.\nAngels are working upon human minds just as these minds are given\nto their charge; they bring precious remembrances fresh before the\nmind as they did to the women about the sepulcher.\nA created instrumentality is used in heaven\u2019s organized plan for\nthe renewing of our nature, working in the children of disobedience\nobedience unto God.

The life-and-\ndeath question with us is, \u201cWhat shall I do that I may be saved,\neternally saved?\u201d \u201cWhat shall I do that I may inherit eternal life\u2014a\nlife that measures with the life of God?\u201d This is a question that it\nbecomes every one of us to consider carefully.. . .\nWhile living in this world we are to be God\u2019s helping hand.\nPaul declared, \u201cYe are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building\u201d (1\nCorinthians 3:9). We are to cooperate with God in every measure\nthat He desires to carry out. Are we fulfilling the purpose of the\neternal God? Are we daily seeking to have the mind of Christ and to\ndo His will in word and work?\nWhat a condition the human family is in today! Have you ever\nseen before such a time of confusion\u2014of violence, of murder, theft,\nand every other kind of crime? In this time, where are we individu-\nally standing?\nIn the fifty-eighth of Isaiah we have read of those who \u201cfast for[99]\nstrife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness\u201d and we\nhave learned that God will not accept such a fast. \u201cYe shall not fast\nas ye do this day,\u201d He declares, \u201cto make your voice to be heard on\nhigh\u201d (Isaiah 58:4).\n\u201cIs it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict\nhis soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread\nsackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an\nacceptable day to the Lord?\n\u201cIs not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of\nwickedness, to undo the heavy burdens [instead of binding them on],\nand to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it\n90\nWhat Are We Worth? 91\nnot to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that\nare cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover\nhim; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\u201d (Isaiah\n58:5-7).\nThe Reward\n\u201cThen [after they do these works of mercy and necessity] shall\nthy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring\nforth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory\nof the Lord shall be thy rereward\u201d (Isaiah 58:8).\nWe are to put into practice the precepts of the law, and thus have\nrighteousness before us; the rearward will be God\u2019s glory. The light\nof the righteousness of Christ will be our front guard, and the glory\nof the Lord will be our rearward. Let us thank the Lord for this\nassurance. Let us constantly stand in a position where the Lord God\nof heaven can favor us. Let us consider that it is our high privilege\nto be in connection with God\u2014to be His helping hand.\nIn God\u2019s great plan for the redemption of a lost race, He has\nplaced Himself under the necessity of using human agencies as\nHis helping hand. He must have a helping hand, in order to reach\nhumanity. He must have the cooperation of those who will be active,\nquick to see opportunities, quick to discern what must be done for\ntheir fellow men.\nChrist gave His life for sinful men and women. He desired to [100]\nrescue the race from a life of transgression to a life of obedience\nand righteousness; and to those who accept Him as their Redeemer\nHe offers the richest reward that Heaven can bestow\u2014even the\ninheritance of life eternal.. . .\nO that we might comprehend more fully the infinite price that\nhas been paid for our redemption! Paul declares, \u201cYe are bought\nwith a price\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:20); and it is true; for the price paid is\nnothing less than the life of the only-begotten Son of God. Let us all\nconsider this. We may refuse the invitations that Christ sends to us;\nwe may neglect His offer of pardon and peace; but still it remains\na fact that every one of us has been bought with a price, even with\nthe precious blood of the Son of God. Therefore, \u201cConsider him\u201d\n(Hebrews 12:3).\n92 Selected Messages Book 1\nYou have cost much. \u201cGlorify God in your body, and in your\nspirit, which are God\u2019s\u201d (1 Corinthians 6:20). That which you may\nregard as your own is God\u2019s. Take care of His property. He has\nbought you with an infinite price. Your mind is His. What right has\nany person to abuse a body that belongs not to himself, but to the\nLord Jesus Christ? What satisfaction can anyone take in gradually\nlessening the powers of body and mind by selfish indulgence of any\nform?\nGod has given to every human being a brain. He desires that it\nshall be used to His glory. By it, man is enabled to cooperate with\nGod in efforts to save perishing fellow mortals. We have none too\nmuch brain power or reasoning faculties. We are to educate and train\nevery power of mind and body\u2014the human mechanism that Christ\nhas bought\u2014in order that we may put it to the best possible use. We\nare to do all we can to strengthen these powers; for God is pleased to\nhave us become more and still more efficient colaborers with Him.\nOf those who do their part faithfully, it is said, \u201cWe are labourers\ntogether with God\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:9). Apart from divine aid, man\ncan do very little; but the heavenly Father and His Son are ready\nto work through everyone who consecrates himself wholly on the[101]\naltar of service. Every soul before me may cooperate with God, and\nlabor for Him acceptably. The Lord desires us all to come into line.\nTo every man He has given an appointed work, according to their\nseveral ability.. . .\nPersonal Experience\nAt the age of seventeen, when all my friends thought I was an\ninvalid for life on account of a severe accident I had sustained in\nmy girlhood, a heavenly visitant came and spoke to me, saying, \u201cI\nhave a message for you to bear.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d I thought, \u201cthere certainly\nmust be a great mistake somewhere.\u201d Again were spoken the words:\n\u201cI have a message for you to bear. Write out for the people what I\ngive you.\u201d Up to that time, my trembling hand had not been able to\nwrite a line. I replied, \u201cI cannot do it; I cannot do it.\u201d \u201cWrite! write!\u201d\nwere the words spoken once again. I took the pen and paper, and I\nbegan to write; and how much I have written since, it is impossible\nto estimate. The strength, the power, was of God.\nWhat Are We Worth? 93\nSince that time, the books that I have written have been published\nin many, many languages, and have gone to all parts of the earth.\nJust a short time ago I received word that a copy of one of my books\nhad been graciously received by the queen of Germany, and that she\nhad written a kind letter expressing her appreciation of the volume.\nTo the Lord be all the praise.\nOf ourselves we can do nothing good. But it is our privilege to\nplace ourselves in right relation to God, and to determine that by His\nhelp we will do our part in this work, to make it better. In the lives\nof those who humbly yet unfalteringly carry out this resolution, will\nbe revealed the glory of God. I know this by experience. I have had\nno power of my own. I have realized that I must hang my helpless\nsoul on Jesus Christ; and as the result of doing this, of praying, and\nof believing, the salvation of God has gone before me, and the glory\nof the Lord has followed.\nI tell you that which I know, for your encouragement and comfort.\nLet us all place ourselves in right relation to God. What satisfaction [102]\nis to be found in keeping pace with the fashions of this world? You\nhave a better work to do. Fashion character. Use every ability, every\nnerve, every muscle, every thought, every action, to the glory of\nGod. Then you will see, as you have never seen before, the salvation\nof God going before you.\nOh, I have nought to complain of. The Lord has never failed me.\nI laid my husband in the grave twenty-two years ago; and several\nyears afterward, when the decision was made that more missionaries\nmust go to Australia to unite with the few who had been sent, we\nwent there ourselves to strengthen the hands of our brethren, and to\nestablish the work on right lines in this new center. There we did\nmuch pioneer work.\nHelping Establish a School\nWe saw the great need for a school in which promising young\nmen and young women could be trained for the Master\u2019s service;\nand we went right into the woods in New South Wales, purchased\nfifteen hundred acres of land, and there established a training school\naway from the cities.. . .\n94 Selected Messages Book 1\nThree years ago we returned to America. Others were sent\nto Australia to take our places. The work has continued to grow;\nprosperity has attended every effort. I wish you could read the letters\nthat come to us. Doubtless you have heard of the dreadful drought\nthat has caused famine in so many places in Australia during the past\ntwo years. Hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle and horses\nhave perished. In all the colonies, and especially in Queensland, the\nsuffering and the financial loss have been great.\nBut the spot that was chosen for our training school, has had\nsufficient rainfall for good pasture land and bountiful crops; in fact,\nin legislative assemblies and in the newspapers of the great cities it\nhas been specified as \u201cthe only green spot in all New South Wales.\u201d\nIs not this remarkable? Has not the Lord blessed? From one of\nthe reports received, we learn that last year seven thousand pounds\nof honey of the best quality has been made on the school estate.\nLarge quantities of vegetables have been raised, and the sale of the[103]\nsurplus has been a source of considerable revenue to the school. All\nthis is very encouraging to us; for we took the wild land, and helped\nto bring it to its present fruitful state. To the Lord we ascribe all the\npraise.\nIn every land and in every community there are many opportuni-\nties for helpful service. Even in these valleys in which we are now\nliving, there are families that need help along spiritual lines. Look\nthese ones up. Use your talent, your ability, by helping them. First\ngive yourself to the Master; then He will work with you. To every\nman He gives his work.\nIs Sister White Getting Rich?\nSometimes it has been reported that I am trying to get rich. Some\nhave written to us, inquiring, \u201cIs not Mrs. White worth millions of\ndollars?\u201d I am glad that I can say, \u201cNo.\u201d I do not own in this world\nany place that is free from debt. Why?\u2014Because I see so much\nmissionary work to be done. Under such circumstances, could I\nhoard money?\u2014No, indeed. I receive royalties from the sale of my\nbooks; but nearly all is spent in missionary work.\nThe head of one of our publishing houses in a distant foreign\nland, upon hearing from others recently that I was in need of means,\nWhat Are We Worth? 95\nsent me a bill of exchange for five hundred dollars; and in the letter\naccompanying the money, he said that in return for the thousands\nupon thousands of dollars royalty that I had turned over to their\nmission field for the translation and distribution of new books and for\nthe support of new missionary enterprises, they regarded the enclosed\nfive hundred dollars as a very small token of their appreciation. They\nsent this because of their desire to help me in my time of special\nneed; but heretofore I have given, for the support of the Lord\u2019s cause\nin foreign lands, all the royalties that come from the sale of my\nforeign books in Europe; and I intend to return this five hundred\ndollars as soon as I can free myself from debt.\nFor the glory of God, I will tell you that about four years ago He\nenabled me to finish writing a book on the parables of Jesus, and [104]\nthen He put it into my heart to give this book for the advancement\nof our denominational educational work.\nAt that time some of our larger training schools and colleges\nwere heavily in debt; but through the efforts of our people to sell this\nbook and to devote the entire proceeds to the liquidation of these\ndebts, over two hundred thousand dollars has already been raised\nand applied on the debts; and the good work is still going on. The\nsuccess of this plan has been a source of great satisfaction to me. I\nam now completing another book, to be used in a similar way for\nother enterprises.\nBut the financial gain is not the most encouraging feature to me.\nI love to dwell on the thought that the circulation of these books is\nbringing many souls into the truth. This thought makes my heart\nglad indeed. I have no time to sit down and mourn. I go right on\nwith my work, and constantly keep writing, writing, writing. Early\nin the morning, when the rest of you are asleep, I am generally up,\nwriting.\nEven affliction has not caused me to cease writing. Not long\nafter going to Australia, I was stricken with disease. Because of\nthe dampness of the houses, I suffered an attack of inflammatory\nrheumatism, which prostrated me for eleven months. At times I\nwas in intense agony. I could sleep in one position for only about\ntwo hours, then I had to be moved so that I could lie in another\nposition. My rubber air mattress gave me very little relief, and I\npassed through periods of great suffering.\n96 Selected Messages Book 1\nBut in spite of this I did not cease my work. My right arm, from\nthe elbow to the finger tips, was free from pain; the rest of the arm,\nthe whole of the left arm, and both shoulders, could not be moved\nvoluntarily. A framework was devised, and by the aid of this, I could\nwrite. During these eleven months, I wrote twenty-five hundred\npages of letter paper, to send across the broad waters of the Pacific\nfor publication in America.\nI feel so thankful to the Lord that He never disappoints me;\nthat He gives me strength and grace. As I stood by the side of my[105]\ndying husband, I placed my hand in his, and said, \u201cDo you know\nme, husband?\u201d He nodded. Said I: \u201cAll through the years I have\nallowed you to bear the business responsibilities, and to lead out in\nnew enterprises. Now I promise you to be a pioneer myself.\u201d And I\nadded, \u201cIf you realize what I say, grasp my hand a little more firmly.\u201d\nHe did so; he could not speak.\nAfter my husband had been laid away in the grave, his friends\nthought of putting up a broken shaft as a monument. \u201cNever!\u201d said\nI, \u201cnever! He has done, singlehanded, the work of three men. Never\nshall a broken monument be placed over his grave!\u201d\nGod has helped me. Today I glorify His name in the presence of\nHis people. I spent nearly ten years in Australia. A wonderful work\nhas been done there; but more than twice as much could have been\naccomplished, if we had had the men and the means that we should\nhave had. We thank God, nevertheless, for His sustaining presence,\nand for what we can now see in that field as the result of the efforts\nput forth.\u2014Manuscript 8, 1904.\nEarnest, Untiring Activity\nCamp meetings should be held in our large cities. And if the\nspeakers are careful in all they say, hearts will be reached as the truth\nis proclaimed in the power of the Spirit. The love of Christ received\ninto the heart will banish the love of error. The love and benevolence\nmanifested in the life of Christ is to be manifested in the lives of\nthose who work for Him. The earnest, untiring activity that marked\nHis life is to mark their lives. The character of the Christian is to be\na reproduction of the character of Christ.\nWhat Are We Worth? 97\nLet us never forget that we are not our own, that we have been\nbought with a price. Our powers are to be regarded as sacred trusts,\nto be used to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men. We\nare a part of the cross of Christ.

O that\nwe may cultivate habits of contemplation of the self-denial and self-\nsacrifice of the life of Christ, until we shall have a deep sense of the\naggravating character of sin, and hate it as the vile thing it is.\nLet the mind awaken to gratitude that through Christ Jesus, the\nFather is faithful to fulfill the promise to forgive all sin. His mercy\nand His love are forever an assurance as we look upon Christ up-\nlifted upon the cross of Calvary. Will we individually rise to the\nappreciation as far as we have capacity to comprehend the truth, that\nGod Jehovah loves and forgives us if we believe in and love Jesus?\nO what a glorious truth! God is waiting to forgive all who come\nunto Him with repentance. Preach it. Lift up Jesus high that the\npeople may behold Him....\nThe Jews saw in the sacrificial offerings the symbol of Christ\nwhose blood was shed for the salvation of the world. All these[107]\nofferings were to typify Christ and to rivet the great truth in their\nhearts that the blood of Jesus Christ alone cleanseth from all sin,\nand without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.\nSome wonder why God desired so many sacrifices and appointed\nthe offering of so many bleeding victims in the Jewish economy.\nEvery dying victim was a type of Christ, which lesson was\nimpressed on mind and heart in the most solemn, sacred ceremony,\nand explained definitely by the priests. Sacrifices were explicitly\nplanned by God Himself to teach this great and momentous truth,\nthat through the blood of Christ alone there is forgiveness of sins.\nThis grand and saving truth is oft repeated in the hearing of\nbelievers and unbelievers, and yet it is with amazement that angels\n98\nAngels Are Amazed 99\nbehold the indifference of men to whom these truths mean so much.\nHow little is evidenced that the church feels the force of the wonder-\nful plan of redemption. How few make this truth, that only through\nfaith in the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ there is forgiveness of the\nsins that cling to human beings like the foul leprosy, a living reality.\nWhat depths of thought should this awaken in every mind! He\nneeded no suffering to atone for Himself. His was a depth of suf-\nfering proportionate to the dignity of His person and His sinless,\nexalted character.\u2014Letter 43, 1892.\nSpasmodic Repentance\n\u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my\nvoice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with\nhim, and he with me. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with\nme in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my\nFather in his throne\u201d (Revelation 3:20, 21).\nSome may say, Why is this message sounded so constantly in\nour ears? It is because you do not thoroughly repent. You do not live\nin Christ and have Christ abiding in you. When one idol is expelled\nfrom the soul, Satan has another prepared to supply its place. Unless\nyou make an entire consecration to Christ and live in communion [108]\nwith Him, unless you make Him your Counselor, you will find that\nyour heart, open to evil thoughts, is easily diverted from the service\nof God to the service of self.\nAt times you may have a desire to repent. But unless you de-\ncidedly reform and put into practice the truths you have learned,\nunless you have an active, working faith, a faith that is constantly\nincreasing in strength, your repentance is as the morning dew. It\nwill give no permanent relief to the soul. A repentance caused by\na spasmodic exercise of the feelings is a repentance that needs to\nbe repented of; for it is delusive. A violent exercise of the feelings,\nwhich does not produce in you the peaceable fruits of righteousness,\nleaves you in a worse state than you were in before.\nEvery day the tempter will be on your track with some delusive,\nplausible excuse for your self-serving, your self-pleasing, and you\nwill fall back into your old practices, neglecting the work of serving\nGod, by which you would gain hope and comfort and assurance.\n100 Selected Messages Book 1\nGod calls for willing service\u2014a service inspired by the love of\nJesus in the heart. God is never satisfied with halfhearted, selfish\nservice.

Shall we believe that God will work in our hearts? that if we\nallow Him to do so, He will make us pure and holy, by His rich grace\nqualifying us to be laborers together with Him? Can we with keen,\nsanctified perception appreciate the strength of the promises of God,\nand appropriate them to our individual selves, not because we are\nworthy, but because Christ is worthy, not because we are righteous,\nbut because by living faith we claim the righteousness of Christ in\nour behalf?\u2014Manuscript 125, 1901.\nChapter 13\u2014Importance of Receiving the Holy [109]\nSpirit\nDuring the night of the first Sabbath of the Newcastle meeting, I\nseemed to be in meeting, presenting the necessity and importance\nof our receiving the Spirit. This was the burden of my labor\u2014the\nopening of our hearts to the Holy Spirit. On one occasion Christ told\nHis disciples, \u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot\nbear them now.\u201d Their limited comprehension put a restraint on Him.\nHe could not open to them the truths He longed to unfold; for while\ntheir hearts were closed to them, His unfolding of these truths would\nbe labor lost. They must receive the Spirit before they could fully\nunderstand Christ\u2019s lessons. \u201cThe Comforter, which is the Holy\nGhost,\u201d Christ said, \u201cwhom the Father will send in my name, he\nshall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance,\nwhatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d\nIn my dream a sentinel stood at the door of an important building,\nand asked every one who came for entrance, \u201cHave ye received the\nHoly Ghost?\u201d A measuring-line was in his hand, and only very, very\nfew were admitted into the building. \u201cYour size as a human being\nis nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you have reached the full stature of a\nman in Christ Jesus, according to the knowledge you have had, you\nwill receive an appointment to sit with Christ at the marriage supper [110]\nof the Lamb; and through the eternal ages, you will never cease to\nlearn of the blessings granted in the banquet prepared for you.\n\u201cYou may be tall and well-proportioned in self, but you cannot\nenter here. None can enter who are grown-up children, carrying with\nthem the disposition, the habits, and the characteristics which pertain\nto children. If you have nurtured suspicions, criticism, temper, self-\ndignity, you cannot be admitted; for you would spoil the feast. All\nwho go in through this door have on the wedding garment, woven\nin the loom of heaven. Those who educate themselves to pick flaws\nin the characters of others, reveal a deformity that makes families\nunhappy, that turns souls from the truth to choose fables. Your\n101\n102 Selected Messages Book 1\nleaven of distrust, your want of confidence, your power of accusing,\ncloses against you the door of admittance. Within this door nothing\ncan enter that could possibly mar the happiness of the dwellers by\nmarring their perfect trust in one another. You cannot join the happy\nfamily in the heavenly courts; for I have wiped all tears from their\neyes. You can never see the King in His beauty if you are not\nyourself a representative of His character.\n\u201cWhen you give up your own will, your own wisdom, and learn\nof Christ, you will find admittance into the kingdom of God. He\nrequires entire, unreserved surrender. Give up your life for Him to\norder, mold, and fashion. Take upon your neck His yoke. Submit to\nbe led and taught by Him. Learn that unless you become as a little\nchild, you can never enter the kingdom of heaven.\n\u201cAbiding in Christ is choosing only the disposition of Christ, so\nthat His interests are identified with yours. Abide in Him, to be and\nto do only what He wills. These are the conditions of discipleship,\nand unless they are complied with, you can never find rest. Rest is\nin Christ; it cannot be as something apart from Him.\n\u201cThe moment His yoke is adjusted to your neck, that moment\nit is found easy; then the heaviest spiritual labor can be performed,\nthe heaviest burdens borne, because the Lord gives the strength\nand the power, and He gives gladness in doing the work. Mark the[111]\npoints: \u2018Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart\u2019 (Matthew\n11:29). Who is it that speaks thus?\u2014The Majesty of heaven, the\nKing of glory. He desires that your conception of spiritual things\nshall be purified from the dross of selfishness, the defilement of a\ncrooked, coarse, unsympathetic nature. You must have an inward,\nhigher experience. You must obtain a growth in grace by abiding in\nChrist. When you are converted, you will not be a hindrance, but\nwill strengthen your brethren.\u201d\nAs these words were spoken, I saw that some turned sadly away\nand mingled with the scoffers. Others, with tears, all broken in heart,\nmade confession to those whom they had bruised and wounded.\nThey did not think of maintaining their own dignity, but asked at\nevery step, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d (Acts 16:30). The answer\nwas, \u201cRepent, and be converted, that your sins may go beforehand\nto judgment, and be blotted out.\u201d Words were spoken which rebuked\nspiritual pride. This God will not tolerate. It is inconsistent with His\nImportance of Receiving the Holy Spirit 103\nWord and with our profession of faith. Seek the Lord, all ye who\nare ministers of His. Seek Him while He may be found, call upon\nHim while He is near. \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, and the\nunrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and\nhe will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly\npardon\u201d (Isaiah 55:7).\nAs I presented these principles to the people in the Sabbath\nmeeting, all seemed to feel that the Lord had spoken through the\nfeeble instrument.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 11, 1899.\nThe time has come when we must expect the Lord to do great\nthings for us. Our efforts must not flag or weaken. We are to grow in\ngrace and in the knowledge of the Lord. Before the work is closed\nup and the sealing of God\u2019s people is finished, we shall receive the\noutpouring of the Spirit of God. Angels from heaven will be in our\nmidst. The present is a fitting-up time for heaven when we must\nwalk in full obedience to all the commands of God.\u2014Letter 30,\n1907.\nChapter 14\u2014In Every Place[112]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 8.]\nChrist was the great Medical Missionary to our world. He calls\nfor volunteers who will cooperate with Him in the great work of\nsowing the world with truth. God\u2019s workers are to plant the stan-\ndards of truth in every place to which they can gain access. The\nworld needs restoring. It is lying in wickedness and the greatest\nperil. God\u2019s work for those out of Christ should broaden and ex-\ntend. God calls upon His people to labor diligently for Him, so that\nChristian efficiency shall become widespread. His kingdom is to\nbe enlarged. Memorials for Him are to be raised in America and in\nforeign countries.\nThe work of health reform connected with the present truth for\nthis time, is a power for good. It is the right hand of the gospel,\nand often opens fields for the entrance of the gospel. But let it ever\nbe remembered that the work must move solidly and in complete\nharmony with God\u2019s plan of organization. Churches are to be orga-\nnized, and in no case are these churches to divorce themselves from\nthe medical missionary work. Neither is the medical missionary\nwork to be divorced from the gospel ministry. When this is done,[113]\nboth are one-sided. Neither is a complete whole.\nThe work for this time is to appeal to the Christian\u2019s mind as\nthe most important work that can be done. It is the question of\ncultivating the Lord\u2019s vineyard. In this vineyard every man has a lot\nand a place, which the Lord has assigned him. And the success of\neach depends on his individual relationship to the one Divine Head.\nThe grace and love of our Lord Jesus Christ and His tender re-\nlationship to His church on earth are to be revealed by the growth\nof His work and the evangelization of people in many places. The\nheavenly principles of truth and righteousness are to be seen more\nand still more plainly in the lives of Christ\u2019s followers. More un-\nselfishness and uncovetousness is to be seen in business transactions\n104\nIn Every Place 105\nthan has been seen in the churches since the pouring out of the Holy\nSpirit on the day of Pentecost. Not a vestige of the influence of\nselfish, worldly monopolies is to make the slightest impression on\nthe people who are watching and working and praying for the second\ncoming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in the clouds of heaven\nwith power and great glory.\nAs a people we are not ready for the Lord\u2019s appearing. If we\nwould close the windows of the soul earthward and open them\nheavenward, every institution established would be a bright and\nshining light in the world. Each member of the church, if he lived\nthe great, elevated, ennobling truths for this time, would be a bright,\nshining light. God\u2019s people cannot please Him unless they are\nsurcharged with the Holy Spirit\u2019s efficiency. So pure and true is\nto be their relationship to one another that by their words, their\naffections, their attributes, they will show that they are one with\nChrist. They are to be as signs and wonders in our world, carrying\nforward intelligently every line of the work. And the different parts\nof the work are to be so harmoniously related to one another that\nall will move like well-regulated machinery. Then will the joy of\nChrist\u2019s salvation be understood. There will then be none of the\nrepresentation now made by those who have been given the light of [114]\ntruth to communicate, but who have not revealed the principles of\ntruth in their association with one another, who have not done the\nLord\u2019s work in a way that glorifies Him....\nAfter Christ rose from the dead, He proclaimed over the sepul-\ncher, \u201cI am the resurrection and the life.\u201d Christ, the risen Saviour, is\nour life.

All claims to knowledge, to influence,\nto power, are worthless without the perfume of Christ\u2019s character.\nChrist must be the very life of the soul, as the blood is the life of the\nbody....\nCleansed From All Selfishness\nThose who are connected with the service of God must be pu-\nrified from every thread of selfishness. All is to be done in accor-\ndance with the injunction, \u201cWhatsoever ye do in word or deed, do\nall\u201d (Colossians 3:17) \u201cto the glory of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:31).\n106 Selected Messages Book 1\nGod\u2019s laws of justice and equity must be strictly obeyed in the trans-\nactions between neighbor and neighbor, brother and brother.

On these grounds alone will our works bear the test of\nthe judgment....\nChristianity is the revealing of the tenderest affection for one an-\nother. The Christian life is made up of Christian duties and Christian\nprivileges. Christ in His wisdom gave to His church in its infancy\na system of sacrifices and offerings, of which He Himself was the\nfoundation, and by which His death was prefigured. Every sacrifice\npointed to Him as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,\nthat all might understand that the wages of sin is death.

In Christian work there is\nample room for the activity of all the gifts God has given. All are[115]\nto be united in carrying out God\u2019s requirements, revealing at every\nadvance step that faith which works by love and purifies the soul.\nChrist is to receive supreme love from the beings He has created.\nAnd He requires also that man shall cherish a sacred regard for his\nfellow beings. Every soul saved will be saved through love, which\nbegins with God. True conversion is a change from selfishness to\nsanctified affection for God and for one another. Will Seventh-day\nAdventists now make a thorough reformation, that their sin-stained\nsouls may be cleansed from the leprosy of selfishness?\nI must speak the truth to all. Those who have accepted the light\nfrom God\u2019s Word are never, never to leave an impression upon\nhuman minds that God will serve with their sins. His Word defines\nsin as the transgression of the law.\u2014Manuscript 16, 1901.\nIn Hard Places\nOften God\u2019s soldiers find themselves brought into hard and dif-\nficult places, they know not why.

They cannot perish, neither can they lose their way if they\nwill follow His guidance, and strive to uphold His law.\u2014Manuscript\n69, 1896.\nChapter 15\u2014When the Church Awakes[116]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 16.]\nPrayer is needed in the home life, in the church life, in the mis-\nsionary life. The efficiency of earnest prayer is but feebly understood.\nWere the church faithful in prayer, she would not be found remiss in\nso many things; for faithfulness in calling upon God will bring rich\nreturns.\nWhen the church awakes to the sense of her holy calling, many\nmore fervent and effective prayers will ascend to heaven for the Holy\nSpirit to point out the work and duty of God\u2019s people regarding the\nsalvation of souls.

When\nthe church awakes to a sense of what must be done in our world,\nthe members will have travail of soul for those who know not God\nand who in their spiritual ignorance cannot understand the truth\nfor this time. Self-denial, self-sacrifice, is to be woven into all our\nexperience. We are to pray and watch unto prayer, that there may be\nno inconsistency in our lives. We must not fail to show others that[117]\nwe understand that watching unto prayer means living our prayers\nbefore God, that He may answer them.\nThe church will not retrograde while the members seek help\nfrom the throne of grace, that they may not fail to cooperate in the\ngreat work of saving the souls that are on the brink of ruin.

These\nhave given you the opportunity of trusting in God, of seeking Him in\nearnest prayer, that you may believe in Him, and rely upon Him with\nsimple faith. It is by suffering that our virtues are tested, and our\nfaith tried. It is in the day of trouble that we feel the preciousness\nof Jesus. You will be given opportunity to say, \u201cThough he slay me,\nyet will I trust in him\u201d (Job 13:15). Oh, it is so precious to think\nthat opportunities are afforded us to confess our faith in the face of [118]\ndanger, and amid sorrow, sickness, pain, and death....\nWith us, everything depends on how we accept the Lord\u2019s terms.\nAs is our spirit, so will be the moral result upon our future life and\ncharacter.

White for\nrevival and reformation was published in The Review and Herald,\nMarch 22, 1887, under the title \u201cThe Church\u2019s Need.\u201d This article\nwas drawn from heavily in the compilation of materials prepared by\nElder A. G. Daniells, for Christ Our Righteousness. in the initial\nprintings (1926 and 1937) the article also appeared in its entirety in\nthe appendix. For mechanical reasons in later printings (1941 and\nonward), the article, selections from which had appeared in the text\nof the book itself, was not included in the appendix. This much-\nsought-after article in its entirety now opens this stirring section.\nThe spiritual contest immediately following a revival, which\nrages between the forces of righteousness and the forces of evil\nfor the souls of those who have begun a new experience, is vividly\nportrayed in this section. In the setting of the great revival at Battle\nCreek College and the events that followed in succeeding months,\nEllen White deals with this vital question. The elements of this\nstruggle are those that are present in every revival effort of the\nchurch.\nThis section closes with the presentation of experiences in audi-\nence response in a number of revivals in which Ellen White herself\nparticipated. These help to show how she carried into her work the\ninstruction concerning soul winning that distinguished her counsels\nto gospel workers. Many of these experiences recorded by Mrs.\nWhite mainly in her daily journal appear in terse, diary style. The\nword pictures she paints of making appeals for public response begin\nwith the early years in Battle Creek and carry over into Europe and\nAustralia, then back again to the United States. There is a certain\namount of repetition in the accounts, but enough of singular interest\nin each item to prove of value to the reader.\nWhite Trustees\n112\nChapter 16\u2014Calls for a Revival [121]\nThe Church\u2019s Great Need\n[Article appearing in appendix to first edition of Christ Our\nRighteousness, but omitted for mechanical reasons from the second\nreset edition.]\nCompilers.\nA revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most\nurgent of all our needs. To seek this should be our first work. There\nmust be earnest effort to obtain the blessing of the Lord, not because\nGod is not willing to bestow His blessing upon us, but because we\nare unprepared to receive it. Our heavenly Father is more willing to\ngive His Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than are earthly parents\nto give good gifts to their children. But it is our work, by confession,\nhumiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to fulfill the conditions\nupon which God has promised to grant us His blessing. A revival\nneed be expected only in answer to prayer. While the people are so\ndestitute of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, they cannot appreciate the preaching\nof the Word; but when the Spirit\u2019s power touches their hearts, then\nthe discourses given will not be without effect. Guided by the\nteachings of God\u2019s Word, with the manifestation of His Spirit, in\nthe exercise of sound discretion, those who attend our meetings will\ngain a precious experience, and returning home, will be prepared to\nexert a healthful influence.\nThe old standard bearers knew what it was to wrestle with God [122]\nin prayer, and to enjoy the outpouring of His Spirit. But these are\npassing off from the stage of action; and who are coming up to\nfill their places? How is it with the rising generation? Are they\nconverted to God? Are we awake to the work that is going on in the\nheavenly sanctuary, or are we waiting for some compelling power to\ncome upon the church before we shall arouse? Are we hoping to see\nthe whole church revived? That time will never come.\n113\n114 Selected Messages Book 1\nThere are persons in the church who are not converted, and who\nwill not unite in earnest, prevailing prayer. We must enter upon\nthe work individually. We must pray more, and talk less. Iniquity\nabounds, and the people must be taught not to be satisfied with a\nform of godliness without the spirit and power. If we are intent upon\nsearching our own hearts, putting away our sins, and correcting\nour evil tendencies, our souls will not be lifted up unto vanity; we\nshall be distrustful of ourselves, having an abiding sense that our\nsufficiency is of God.\nWe have far more to fear from within than from without. The\nhindrances to strength and success are far greater from the church\nitself than from the world. Unbelievers have a right to expect that\nthose who profess to be keeping the commandments of God and\nthe faith of Jesus, will do more than any other class to promote and\nhonor, by their consistent lives, by their godly example and their\nactive influence, the cause which they represent. But how often have\nthe professed advocates of the truth proved the greatest obstacle to\nits advancement! The unbelief indulged, the doubts expressed, the\ndarkness cherished, encourage the presence of evil angels, and open\nthe way for the accomplishment of Satan\u2019s devices.\nOpening the Door to the Adversary\nThe adversary of souls is not permitted to read the thoughts of\nmen; but he is a keen observer, and he marks the words; he takes\naccount of actions, and skillfully adapts his temptations to meet the\ncases of those who place themselves in his power. If we would labor[123]\nto repress sinful thoughts and feelings, giving them no expression in\nwords or actions, Satan would be defeated; for he could not prepare\nhis specious temptations to meet the case.\nBut how often do professed Christians, by their lack of self-con-\ntrol, open the door to the adversary of souls! Divisions, and even\nbitter dissensions which would disgrace any worldly community, are\ncommon in the churches, because there is so little effort to control\nwrong feelings, and to repress every word that Satan can take ad-\nvantage of. As soon as an alienation of feeling arises, the matter is\nspread before Satan for his inspection, and the opportunity given for\nhim to use his serpentlike wisdom and skill in dividing and destroy-\nCalls for a Revival 115\ning the church. There is great loss in every dissension. Personal\nfriends of both parties take sides with their respective favorites, and\nthus the breach is widened. A house divided against itself cannot\nstand. Criminations and recriminations are engendered and multi-\nplied. Satan and his angels are actively at work to secure a harvest\nfrom seed thus sown.\nWorldlings look on, and jeeringly exclaim, \u201cBehold how these\nChristians hate one another! If this is religion, we do not want it.\u201d\nAnd they look upon themselves and their irreligious characters with\ngreat satisfaction. Thus they are confirmed in their impenitence, and\nSatan exults at his success.\nThe great deceiver has prepared his wiles for every soul that is\nnot braced for trial and guarded by constant prayer and living faith.\nAs ministers, as Christians, we must work to take the stumbling\nblocks out of the way. We must remove every obstacle. Let us\nconfess and forsake every sin, that the way of the Lord may be\nprepared, that He may come into our assemblies and impart His rich\ngrace. The world, the flesh, and the devil must be overcome.\nWe cannot prepare the way by gaining the friendship of the world,\nwhich is enmity with God; but by His help we can break its seductive\ninfluence upon ourselves and upon others. We cannot individually\nor as a body secure ourselves from the constant temptations of a [124]\nrelentless and determined foe; but in the strength of Jesus we can\nresist them.\nFrom every member of the church a steady light may shine forth\nbefore the world, so that they shall not be led to inquire, What do\nthese people more than others? There can be and must be a with-\ndrawal from conformity to the world, a shunning of all appearance\nof evil, so that no occasion shall be given for gainsayers. We cannot\nescape reproach; it will come; but we should be very careful that we\nare not reproached for our own sins or follies, but for Christ\u2019s sake.\nThere is nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people\nof God shall clear the way by removing every hindrance, so that\nthe Lord can pour out His Spirit upon a languishing church and an\nimpenitent congregation. If Satan had his way, there would never be\nanother awakening, great or small, to the end of time. But we are\nnot ignorant of his devices. It is possible to resist his power. When\nthe way is prepared for the Spirit of God, the blessing will come.\n116 Selected Messages Book 1\nSatan can no more hinder a shower of blessing from descending\nupon God\u2019s people than he can close the windows of heaven that\nrain cannot come upon the earth. Wicked men and devils cannot\nhinder the work of God, or shut out His presence from the assemblies\nof His people, if they will, with subdued, contrite hearts, confess\nand put away their sins, and in faith claim His promises. Every\ntemptation, every opposing influence, whether open or secret, may\nbe successfully resisted, \u201cnot by might, nor by power, but by my\nspirit, saith the Lord of hosts\u201d (Zechariah 4:6).\nWe Are in the Day of Atonement\nWe are in the great day of atonement, when our sins are, by\nconfession and repentance, to go beforehand to judgment. God does\nnot now accept a tame, spiritless testimony from His ministers. Such\na testimony would not be present truth. The message for this time\nmust be meat in due season to feed the church of God. But Satan\nhas been seeking gradually to rob this message of its power, that the[125]\npeople may not be prepared to stand in the day of the Lord.\nIn 1844 our great High Priest entered the most holy place of the\nheavenly sanctuary, to begin the work of the investigative judgment.\nThe cases of the righteous dead have been passing in review before\nGod. When that work shall be completed, judgment is to be pro-\nnounced upon the living. How precious, how important are these\nsolemn moments! Each of us has a case pending in the court of\nheaven. We are individually to be judged according to the deeds\ndone in the body. In the typical service, when the work of atone-\nment was performed by the high priest in the most holy place of\nthe earthly sanctuary, the people were required to afflict their souls\nbefore God, and confess their sins, that they might be atoned for and\nblotted out. Will any less be required of us in this antitypical day of\natonement, when Christ in the sanctuary above is pleading in behalf\nof His people, and the final, irrevocable decision is to be pronounced\nupon every case?\nWhat is our condition in this fearful and solemn time? Alas, what\npride is prevailing in the church, what hypocrisy, what deception,\nwhat love of dress, frivolity, and amusement, what desire for the\nsupremacy! All these sins have clouded the mind, so that eternal\nCalls for a Revival 117\nthings have not been discerned. Shall we not search the Scriptures,\nthat we may know where we are in this world\u2019s history? Shall we not\nbecome intelligent in regard to the work that is being accomplished\nfor us at this time, and the position that we as sinners should occupy\nwhile this work of atonement is going forward? If we have any\nregard for our souls\u2019 salvation, we must make a decided change. We\nmust seek the Lord with true penitence; we must with deep contrition\nof soul confess our sins, that they may be blotted out.\nWe must no longer remain upon the enchanted ground. We are\nfast approaching the close of our probation. Let every soul inquire,\nHow do I stand before God? We know not how soon our names may\nbe taken into the lips of Christ, and our cases be finally decided.\nWhat, oh, what will these decisions be! Shall we be counted with [126]\nthe righteous, or shall we be numbered with the wicked?\nThe Church to Arise and Repent\nLet the church arise, and repent of her backslidings before God.\nLet the watchmen awake, and give the trumpet a certain sound. It\nis a definite warning that we have to proclaim. God commands His\nservants, \u201cCry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and\nshew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their\nsins\u201d (Isaiah 58:1). The attention of the people must be gained;\nunless this can be done, all effort is useless; though an angel from\nheaven should come down and speak to them, his words would do\nno more good than if he were speaking into the cold ear of death.\nThe church must arouse to action. The Spirit of God can never\ncome in until she prepares the way. There should be earnest search-\ning of heart. There should be united, persevering prayer, and through\nfaith a claiming of the promises of God. There should be, not a\nclothing of the body with sackcloth, as in ancient times, but a deep\nhumiliation of soul. We have not the first reason for self-congratu-\nlation and self-exaltation. We should humble ourselves under the\nmighty hand of God. He will appear to comfort and bless the true\nseekers.\nThe work is before us; will we engage in it? We must work fast,\nwe must go steadily forward. We must be preparing for the great\nday of the Lord. We have no time to lose, no time to be engaged in\n118 Selected Messages Book 1\nselfish purposes. The world is to be warned. What are we doing as\nindividuals to bring the light before others? God has left to every\nman his work; every one has a part to act, and we cannot neglect this\nwork except at the peril of our souls.\nO my brethren, will you grieve the Holy Spirit, and cause it\nto depart? Will you shut out the blessed Saviour, because you are\nunprepared for His presence? Will you leave souls to perish without\nthe knowledge of the truth, because you love your ease too well\nto bear the burden that Jesus bore for you? Let us awake out of\nsleep. \u201cBe sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a[127]\nroaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour\u201d (1 Peter\n5:8).\u2014The Review and Herald, March 22, 1887.\nReformation Accompanies Revival\nIn many hearts there seems to be scarcely a breath of spiritual\nlife. This makes me very sad. I fear that aggressive warfare against\nthe world, the flesh, and the devil has not been maintained. Shall we\ncheer on, by a half-dead Christianity, the selfish, covetous spirit of\nthe world, sharing its ungodliness and smiling on its falsehood?\u2014\nNay! By the grace of God let us be steadfast to the principles of\ntruth, holding firm to the end the beginning of our confidence. We\nare to be \u201cnot slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\u201d\n(Romans 12:11). One is our Master, even Christ. To Him we are to\nlook. From Him we are to receive our wisdom. By His grace we\nare to preserve our integrity, standing before God in meekness and\ncontrition, and representing Him to the world.\nSermons have been in great demand in our churches. The mem-\nbers have depended upon pulpit declamations instead of on the Holy\nSpirit. Uncalled for and unused, the spiritual gifts bestowed on them\nhave dwindled into feebleness. If the ministers would go forth into\nnew fields, the members would be obliged to bear responsibilities,\nand by use their capabilities would increase.\nGod brings against ministers and people the heavy charge of\nspiritual feebleness, saying, \u201cI know thy works, that thou art neither\ncold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou\nart lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my\nmouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,\nCalls for a Revival 119\nand have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked: I counsel thee to\nbuy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white\nraiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy\nnakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that\nthou mayest see\u201d (Revelation 3:15-18). God calls for a spiritual [128]\nrevival and a spiritual reformation. Unless this takes place, those\nwho are lukewarm will continue to grow more abhorrent to the Lord,\nuntil He will refuse to acknowledge them as His children.\nA revival and a reformation must take place, under the ministra-\ntion of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different\nthings. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of\nthe powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual death.\nReformation signifies a reorganization, a change in ideas and the-\nories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring forth the\ngood fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival of\nthe Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work,\nand in doing this work they must blend.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nFebruary 25, 1902.\nSimple Agencies Will Be Used\nRepresentations have been made to me, showing that the Lord\nwill carry out His plans through a variety of ways and instruments.\nIt is not alone the most talented, not alone those who hold high\npositions of trust, or are the most highly educated from a worldly\npoint of view, whom the Lord uses to do His grand and holy work of\nsoulsaving. He will use simple means; He will use many who have\nhad few advantages to help in carrying forward His work. He will,\nby the use of simple means, bring those who possess property and\nlands to a belief of the truth, and these will be influenced to become\nthe Lord\u2019s helping hand in the advancement of His work.\u2014Letter\n62, 1909.\nChapter 17\u2014Safeguarding the New Experience[129]\nThe Contest Following the Revival\n[In 1893 there was a marked revival in our institutions at our Battle\nCreek headquarters, with large evidence of the work of the Spirit of\nGod. Much of the blessing was lost in events which followed in\nquick succession. In this experience and the counsel given in\nconnection with it may be found lessons which are of value\ntoday.\u2014Compilers.]\nAfter the outpouring of the Spirit of God in Battle Creek it was\nproved in the college that a time of great spiritual light is also a time\nof corresponding spiritual darkness. Satan and his legions of satanic\nagencies are on the ground, pressing their powers upon every soul\nto make of none effect the showers of grace that have come from\nheaven to revive and quicken the dormant energies into decided\naction to impart that which God has imparted. Had all the many\nsouls, then enlightened, gone to work at once to impart to others\nthat which God had given to them for that very purpose, more light\nwould have been given, more power bestowed. God does not give\nlight merely for one person but that he may diffuse light, and God\nbe glorified. Its influence is felt.\nIn every age seasons of spiritual revival and the outpouring of\nthe Holy Spirit have been followed by spiritual darkness and pre-[130]\nvailing corruptions. Taking into account that which God has done\nin opportunities and privileges and blessings in Battle Creek, the\nchurch has not made honorable progress in doing her work, and\nGod\u2019s blessing will not rest upon the church in advancing still more\nlight until they use the light as God has directed in His Word. The\nlight that would shine in clear and distinct rays will grow dim amid\nthe moral darkness. The aggressive power of the truth of God is\ndependent upon the cooperation of the human agent with God in\npiety, in zeal, in unselfish efforts to get the light of truth before\nothers.\u2014Manuscript 45, 1893.\n120\nSafeguarding the New Experience 121\nPeril of Confusing the Spirit\u2019s Work with Fanaticism\nThere have been things written to me in regard to the movings\nof the Spirit of God at the last conference [1893], and at the college,\nwhich clearly indicate that because these blessings were not lived up\nto, minds have been confused, and that which was light from heaven\nhas been called excitement. I have been made sad to have this matter\nviewed in this light. We must be very careful not to grieve the Holy\nSpirit of God, in pronouncing the ministration of His Holy Spirit a\nspecies of fanaticism. How shall we understand the workings of the\nSpirit of God if it was not revealed in clear and unmistakable lines,\nnot only in Battle Creek but in many places?\nI am not surprised that anyone should be confused at the after\nresult. But in my experience of the past forty-nine years I have seen\nmuch of these things, and I have known that God has wrought in a\nmarked manner; and let no one venture to say this is not the Spirit\nof God. It is just that which we are authorized to believe and pray\nfor, for God is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask\nHim than parents are to give good gifts unto their children. But the\nHoly Spirit is not for the human agent to work; it is to work and use\nthe human agent. That God did abundantly bless the students in the\nschool and the church, I have not one doubt; but a period of great\nlight and the outpouring of the Spirit is quite generally followed by [131]\na time of great darkness. Why? Because the enemy works with all\nhis deceiving energies to make of none effect the deep movings of\nthe Spirit of God on the human subject.\nWhen the students at the school went into their match games\nand football playing, when they became absorbed in the amusement\nquestion, Satan saw it a good time to step in and make of none effect\nthe Holy Spirit of God in molding and using the human subject.\nHad the teachers to a man done their duty, had they realized their\naccountability, had they stood in moral independence before God,\nhad they used the ability which God had given them according to the\nsanctification of the spirit through the love of the truth, they would\nhave had spiritual strength and divine enlightenment to press on and\non and upward on the ladder of progress reaching heavenward. The\nfact is evident that they did not appreciate or walk in the light or\nfollow the Light of the world.\n122 Selected Messages Book 1\nIt is an easy matter to idle away, talk and play away, the Holy\nSpirit\u2019s influence. To walk in the light is to keep moving onward\nin the direction of light. If the one blessed becomes negligent and\ninattentive and does not watch unto prayer, if he does not lift the\ncross and bear the yoke of Christ, if his love of amusements and\nstrivings for the mastery absorb his power or ability, then God is not\nmade the first and best and last in everything, and Satan comes in\nto act his part in playing the game of life for his soul. He can play\nmuch more earnestly than they can play, and make deep-laid plots\nfor the ruin of the soul....\nThe results after the working of the Spirit of God in Battle Creek\nare not because of fanaticism, but because those who were blessed\ndid not show forth the praises of Him who called them out of dark-\nness into His marvelous light; and when the earth is lightened with\nthe glory of God, some will not know what it is, and from whence it\ncame, because they misapplied and misinterpreted the Spirit shed\nupon them. God is a jealous God of His own glory. He will not\nhonor those who dishonor Him. Some persons living in the light\nought to have instructed these souls young in experience to walk in[132]\nthe light after they had received the light. I wish I had time to write\nmore fully, but I fear I have not.\u2014Letter 58, 1893.\nEasy Ways to Lose the Blessing\nSome things have been urged upon my mind with great force of\nlate, and I feel constrained by the Spirit of God to write in reference\nto them. [Addressed to the president of Battle Creek College.]\nHas the Lord graciously opened to you the windows of heaven and\npoured you out a blessing? Oh! Then, that was the very time to\neducate the teachers and students how to retain the precious favor\nof God by working in accordance with increased light, and send its\nprecious rays to others. Has Heaven\u2019s light been given? And for\nwhat purpose has it been given? That the light should shine forth in\npractical works of righteousness. When those so abundantly blessed\nshall be seen with deeper and more fervent piety, having a sense\nthat they have been bought with the precious blood of the Lamb of\nGod, and are clothed with the garments of His salvation, will they\nnot represent Christ?\nSafeguarding the New Experience 123\nHave not the playing of games, and rewards, and the using of\nthe boxing glove been educating and training after Satan\u2019s direction\nto lead to the possession of his attributes? What if they could see\nJesus, the Man of Calvary looking upon them in sorrow, as was\nrepresented to me. Things are certainly receiving a wrong mold,\nand are counteracting the work of the divine power which has been\ngraciously bestowed. The work of every true Christian is to represent\nChrist, to reflect light, to elevate the standard of morals, and by\nwords and influence consecrated to God, to compel the careless and\nreckless to think of God and eternity. The world would gladly drop\neternity out of their reckoning, but they cannot succeed so long as\nthere are those who represent Christ in their practical life.\nEvery believer forms a link in the golden chain connecting the\nsoul to Jesus Christ, and is the channel of communication of that\nlight to those who are in darkness. Let one lose his connection with [133]\nChrist, and Satan seizes the opportunity to lead him to dishonor\nChrist by words, by spirit, by action, and thus Christ\u2019s character is\nmisinterpreted. I ask you, my brother, if the religion of Jesus Christ\nis not by the excess of the amusements misunderstood. When the\nLord gave to Battle Creek the riches of His grace, were there those\nin responsibility who could have directed these souls as to how to\nimprove upon the endowment given, in doing good, useful work that\nwould give a change from their studies, other than the excitement\nand emotions caused by their games? This kind of pastime is not\nimproving mind or spirit or manners for the preparation for the\nscenes of trial that they must soon enter. The superficial piety that\npasses for religion will be consumed when tried in the furnace.\nThe Lord would have the teachers consider the contagion of their\nown example. They need to pray much more and consider that the\nconvictions which flow out from a well-ordered life and a godly\nconversation, from a living, decided Christianity, are the preparation\nof the garden of the heart for the seeds of truth to be planted for a\nfruitful harvest, and for the Sun of Righteousness when He comes\nwith healing in His beams. Let your righteousness so shine before\nmen, \u201cthat they may see your good works, and glorify your Father\nwhich is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). \u201cYe are,\u201d said Christ to His\ndisciples, \u201cthe salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,\nwherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing,\n124 Selected Messages Book 1\nbut to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men\u201d (Matthew\n5:13). The church illuminates the world, not by their profession of\ngodliness, but by their manifestation of the transforming, sanctifying\npower of the truth on life and character....\nThe time is altogether too full of tokens of the coming conflict\nto be educating the youth in fun and games.\u2014Letter 46, 1893.\nDanger of Light Becoming Darkness\nThe Lord has condescended to give you an outpouring of His\nHoly Spirit. At the camp meetings, and in our various institutions, a[134]\ngreat blessing has been showered upon you. You have been visited\nby the heavenly messengers of light and truth and power, and it\nshould not be thought a strange thing that God should thus bless\nyou. How does Christ subdue His chosen people to Himself?\u2014It\nis by the power of His Holy Spirit; for the Holy Spirit, through the\nScriptures, speaks to the mind, and impresses truth upon the hearts\nof men. Before His crucifixion, Christ promised that the Comforter\nshould be sent to His disciples. He said: \u201cIt is expedient for you\nthat I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come\nunto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. And when he is\ncome, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of\njudgment.... When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you\ninto all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he\nshall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.\nHe shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it\nunto you\u201d (John 16:7, 8, 13-15).\nThis promise of Christ has been made little enough of, and\nbecause of a dearth of the Spirit of God, the spirituality of the law\nand its eternal obligations have not been comprehended. Those who\nhave professed to love Christ, have not comprehended the relation\nwhich exists between them and God, and it is still but dimly outlined\nto their understanding. They but vaguely comprehend the amazing\ngrace of God in giving His only-begotten Son for the salvation of\nthe world. They do not understand how far reaching are the claims\nof the holy law, how intimately the precepts of the law are to be\nbrought into practical life. They do not realize what a great privilege\nand necessity are prayer, repentance, and the doing of the words\nSafeguarding the New Experience 125\nof Christ. It is the office of the Holy Spirit to reveal to the mind\nthe character of the consecration that God will accept. Through the\nagency of the Holy Spirit, the soul is enlightened, and the character\nis renewed, sanctified, and uplifted.\nThrough the deep movings of the Spirit of God, I have had\nopened before me the character of the work of the visitation of the\nSpirit of God. I have had opened before me the danger in which [135]\nsouls would be placed who had been thus visited; for afterward, they\nwould have to meet fiercer assaults of the enemy, who would press\nupon them his temptations to make of none effect the workings of\nthe Spirit of God, and cause that the momentous truths presented and\nwitnessed by the Holy Spirit, should not purify and sanctify those\nwho had received the light of heaven, and thus cause that Christ\nshould not be glorified in them.\nThe period of great spiritual light, if that light is not sacredly\ncherished and acted upon, will be turned into a time of corresponding\nspiritual darkness. The impression made by the Spirit of God, if\nmen do not cherish the sacred impression, and occupy holy ground,\nwill fade from the mind. Those who would advance in spiritual\nknowledge must stand by the very fount of God, and drink again and\nagain from the wells of salvation so graciously opened unto them.\nThey must never leave the source of refreshment; but with hearts\nswelling with gratitude and love at the display of the goodness and\ncompassion of God, they must be continually partakers of the living\nwater.\nOh, how much this means to every soul\u2014\u201cI am the light of the\nworld\u201d; \u201cI am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never\nhunger [for anything more satisfying]; and he that believeth on me\nshall never thirst\u201d (John 8:12; 6:35). To come to this condition\nmeans that you have found the Source of light and love, and have\nlearned when and how you may be replenished, and may make use\nof the promises of God by continually applying them to your souls.\n\u201cBut I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not\u201d\n(John 6:36). This has been literally fulfilled in the cases of many; for\nthe Lord gave them a deeper insight into truth, into His character of\nmercy and compassion and love; and yet after being thus enlightened,\nthey have turned from Him in unbelief. They saw the deep movings\nof the Spirit of God; but when the insidious temptations of Satan\n126 Selected Messages Book 1\ncame in, as they always will come after a season of revival, they\ndid not resist unto blood, striving against sin; and those who might\nhave stood on vantage ground, had they made a right use of the[136]\nprecious enlightenment that they had, were overcome by the enemy.\nThey should have reflected the light that God gave to them upon the\nsouls of others; they should have worked and acted in harmony with\nthe sacred revealings of the Holy Spirit; and in not doing so, they\nsuffered loss.\nSpiritual Victory Lost to the Passions for Games\nAmong the students the spirit of fun and frolic was indulged.\nThey became so interested in playing games that the Lord was\ncrowded out of their minds; and Jesus stood among you in the\nplayground, saying, O that thou hadst known, \u201ceven thou, at least\nin this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!\u201d (Luke\n19:42). \u201cYe also have seen me, and believe not\u201d (John 6:36). Yes;\nChrist revealed Himself to you, and deep impressions were made as\nthe Holy Spirit moved upon your hearts; but you pursued a course\nby which you lost these sacred impressions, and failed to maintain\nthe victory. \u201cAll that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and\nhim that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out\u201d (John 6:37). You\nbegan to come to Christ, but you did not abide in Christ. You\nforsook Him, and the realization you had had of the great favors and\nblessings He had given you, was lost from your heart. The question\nof amusement occupied so large a place in your minds, that after the\nsolemn visitation of the Spirit of God, you entered into its discussion\nwith such great zeal that all barriers were broken down; and through\nyour passion for games, you neglected to heed the word of Christ:\n\u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation\u201d (Mark 14:38).\nThe place that should have been occupied by Jesus was usurped by\nyour passion for games. You chose your amusements instead of the\ncomfort of the Holy Spirit. You did not follow the example of Jesus,\nwho said, \u201cI came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but\nthe will of him that sent me\u201d (John 6:38).\nThe minds of many are so bewildered with their own human de-\nsires and inclinations, and they have been so in the habit of indulging\nthem, that they cannot comprehend the true sense of the Scriptures.[137]\nSafeguarding the New Experience 127\nMany suppose that in following Christ they will be obliged to be\ngloomy and disconsolate, because they are required to deny them-\nselves the pleasures and follies that the world indulge in. The living\nChristian will be filled with cheerfulness and peace, because he lives\nas seeing Him who is invisible; and those who seek Christ in His\ntrue character have within them the elements of everlasting life,\nbecause they are partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruptions that are in the world through lust. Jesus said, \u201cThis is\nthe Father\u2019s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given\nme, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.\nAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth\nthe Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will\nraise him up at the last day\u201d (John 6:39, 40).\nThe Child of God a Laborer With God\nAll spiritual life is derived from Jesus Christ. \u201cAs many as\nreceived him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God\u201d\n(John 1:12). But what is the sure result of becoming a child of God?\nThe result is that we become laborers together with God. There is a\ngreat work to be done for your own soul\u2019s salvation, and to qualify\nyou to win others from unbelief to a life sustained by faith in Christ\nJesus: \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me [with\na casual faith?\u2014No, with an abiding faith that works by love and\npurifies the soul] hath everlasting life. I am that bread of life.... I am\nthe living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of\nthis bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my\nflesh, which I will give for the life of the world.... Except ye eat the\nflesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.\nWhoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and\nI will raise him up at the last day.... It is the Spirit that quickeneth;\nthe flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are\nspirit, and they are life. But there are some of you that believe not.\nFor Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, [138]\nand who should betray him. And he said, Therefore said I unto you,\nthat no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my\nFather\u201d (John 6:47, 48, 51, 53, 54, 63-65).\n128 Selected Messages Book 1\nWhen Jesus spoke these words, He spoke them with authority,\nassurance, and power. At times He manifested Himself in such a\nway that the deep movings of His Spirit were sensibly realized. But\nmany who saw and heard and participated in the blessings of the\nhour, went their way, and soon forgot the light He had given them.\nThe treasures of eternity have been committed to the keeping of\nJesus Christ, to give to whomsoever He will; but how sad it is that so\nmany quickly lose sight of the precious grace that is proffered unto\nthem through faith in Him. He will impart the heavenly treasures\nto those who will believe in Him, look to Him, and abide in Him.\nHe thought it not robbery to be equal with God, and He knows no\nrestraint nor control in bestowing the heavenly treasures upon whom\nHe will. He does not exalt and honor the great ones of the world,\nwho are flattered and applauded; but He calls upon His chosen,\npeculiar people who love and serve Him, to come unto Him and ask,\nand He will give them the bread of life, and endow them with the\nwater of life, which shall be in them as a well of water springing up\nunto everlasting life.\nJesus brought to our world the accumulated treasures of God,\nand all who believe upon Him are adopted as His heirs. He declares\nthat great shall be the reward of them who suffer for His name\u2019s\nsake, It is written, \u201cEye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have\nentered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for\nthem that love him\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:9).\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJanuary 30, 1894.\nWas the Blessing Cherished?\nIn order to increase our spiritual endowment, it is necessary to\nwalk in the light. In view of the event of Christ\u2019s soon coming, we\nmust be vigilantly working to prepare our own souls, to keep our own\nlamps trimmed and burning, and to urge upon others the necessity[139]\nof getting ready for the coming of the Bridegroom. Watching and\nworking must go together; faith and works must be united, or our\ncharacters will not be symmetrical and well-balanced, perfect in\nChrist Jesus.\nShould we give our lives up to prayerful meditation, our lights\nwould grow dim, for light is given to us that we may impart it to\nSafeguarding the New Experience 129\nothers, and the more we impart light, the brighter our own light will\nbecome. If there is any one thing in the world in which we may\nmanifest enthusiasm, it may be manifested in seeking the salvation\nof the souls for whom Christ died. Work of this kind will not cause us\nto neglect personal piety. The exhortation is given for us to be \u201cnot\nslothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord\u201d (Romans\n12:11).\nTo have an eye single to the glory of God means to have sin-\ngleness of purpose, to show forth the work that has been wrought\nin your heart, that subdues your will to the will of God, and brings\ninto captivity every thought to the glory of God. The world has been\nlooking upon you to see what would be the afterinfluence of the\nwork of revival that came to the college, the sanitarium, the office\nof publication, and to the members of the church in Battle Creek.\nWhat testimony have you borne in your daily life and character?\nGod expected you all to do your best, not to please, amuse, and\nglorify yourselves, but to honor Him in all your ways, returning unto\nHim according to the light and privileges that He had given you\nthrough the endowment of His grace. He expected you to testify\nbefore heavenly intelligences, and to be living witnesses to the world,\nof the power of the grace of Christ. The Lord tested you, to see if\nyou would treat His rich blessing as a cheap, light matter, or regard it\nas a rich treasure to be handled with reverent awe. If all had treated\nthe gift of God in this manner\u2014for the work was of God\u2014then,\naccording to the measure of each one\u2019s responsibility, the grace\ngiven would have been doubled, as were the talents of him who\ntraded diligently with his lord\u2019s money.\nA Blessing Turned Into a Curse [140]\nGod has been testing the fidelity of His people, proving them\nto see what use they would make of His intrusted precious bless-\ning. This blessing came from our Intercessor and Advocate in the\nheavenly courts; but Satan was ready to enter any avenue that was\nopen for him, in order that he might turn the light and blessing into\ndarkness and cursing.\nHow may the blessing be turned into a curse? By persuading the\nhuman agent not to cherish the light, or not to reveal to the world\n130 Selected Messages Book 1\nthat it has been effective in transforming the character. Imbued with\nthe Holy Spirit, the human agent consecrates himself to cooperate\nwith divine agencies. He bears the yoke of Christ, lifts his burdens,\nand works in Christ\u2019s line to gain precious victories. He walks in\nthe light as Christ is in the light. The scripture is fulfilled to him,\n\u201cWe all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,\nare changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the\nSpirit of the Lord\u201d (2 Corinthians 3:18).\nAnother year has now passed into eternity with its burden of\nrecord; and the light which shone from heaven upon you was to\nprepare you to arise and shine, to show forth the praises of God\nto the world as His commandment-keeping people. You were to\nbe living witnesses; but if no special endeavor of a high and holy\ncharacter bears testimony before the world, if no higher effort has\nbeen made than that which is seen in the popular churches of the day,\nthen the name of God has not been honored, and His truth has not\nbeen magnified before the world, by presenting divine credentials in\nthe people who have received great light. If they have had no greater\nappreciation of the manifest power of God than to eat and drink, and\nrise up to play, as did ancient Israel, then how can the Lord trust His\npeople with rich and gracious manifestations? If they act directly\ncontrary in almost every respect to the known will of God, and are\nfound in carelessness, in levity, in selfishness, in ambition and pride,\ncorrupting their way before the Lord, how can He give them another[141]\noutpouring of the Holy Spirit?\nGod has the richest blessing for His people; but He cannot bestow\nit until they know how to treat the precious gift in showing forth\nthe praises of Him who has called them out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light. \u201cWherefore seeing we also are compassed about\nwith so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and\nthe sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the\nrace that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher\nof our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the\ncross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the\nthrone of God\u201d (Hebrews 12:1, 2). A portion of the joy which was\nset before Christ, was the joy of seeing His truth armed with the\nomnipotent power of the Holy Spirit, impressing His image upon\nthe life and character of His followers.\nSafeguarding the New Experience 131\nDivine intelligences cooperate with human agencies as they seek\nto magnify the law and make it honorable. The law of the Lord is\nperfect, converting the soul. It is in the converted soul that the world\nsees a living testimony. Then shall the Lord of heaven have room\nto work? Shall He find a place in the hearts of those who claim to\nbelieve the truth? Shall His pure, disinterested benevolence meet\nwith a response from the human agent? Shall the world see a display\nof the glory of Christ in the characters of those who profess to be His\ndisciples? Shall Christ be favored and glorified in seeing His own\nsympathy and love pouring forth in streams of goodness and truth\nfrom His human agents? In implanting His gospel in the heart, He\nis pouring out the resources of heaven for the blessing of the world.\n\u201cWe are labourers together with God: ye are God\u2019s husbandry, ye\nare God\u2019s building\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:9).\nWhat has the rich blessing of God done for those who were\nhumble and contrite in heart to receive it? Has the blessing been\ncherished? Have the receivers been showing forth the praises of\nHim who has called them out of darkness into His marvelous light?\nThere are some who are already questioning the work that was so\ngood, and that should have been most highly appreciated. They are [142]\nlooking upon it as a certain species of fanaticism.\nBe Exceedingly Careful\nIt would be surprising if there were not some, who, not being\nwell-balanced in mind, have spoken and acted indiscreetly; for when-\never and wherever the Lord works in giving a genuine blessing, a\ncounterfeit is also revealed, in order to make of none effect the true\nwork of God. Therefore we need to be exceedingly careful, and\nwalk humbly before God, that we may have spiritual eyesalve that\nwe may distinguish the working of the Holy Spirit of God from the\nworking of that spirit that would bring in wild license and fanaticism.\n\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them\u201d (Matthew 7:20). Those who\nare really beholding Christ will be changed into His image, even by\nthe Spirit of the Lord, and will grow up to the full stature of men\nand women in Christ Jesus. The Holy Spirit of God will inspire\nmen with love and purity; and refinement will be manifest in their\ncharacters.\n132 Selected Messages Book 1\nBut because some have misappropriated the rich blessing of\nheaven, shall others deny that Jesus, the Saviour of the world, has\npassed through our churches, and that to bless? Let not doubt and\nunbelief question this; for in so doing, you are treading on dangerous\nground. God has given the Holy Spirit to those who have opened the\ndoor of their hearts to receive the heavenly gift. But let them not yield\nto the temptation afterward to believe that they have been deceived.\nLet them not say, \u201cBecause I feel darkness, and am oppressed with\ndoubt, and never saw Satan\u2019s power so manifest as now, therefore I\nwas mistaken.\u201d I warn you to be careful.

Blessing was given you, that it\nmight produce fruit in sound practices and upright character.\nThe Sin of Rejecting Evidence\nThe sin for which Christ reproved Chorazin and Bethsaida was\nthe sin of rejecting evidence that would have convinced them of[143]\nthe truth, had they yielded to its power. The sin of the scribes and\nPharisees was the sin of placing the heavenly work which had been\nwrought before them in the darkness of unbelief, so that the evidence\nwhich should have led them into a settled faith was questioned, and\nthe sacred things which should have been cherished were regarded\nas of no value. I fear that the people have permitted the enemy to\nwork along these very lines, so that the good which emanated from\nGod, the rich blessing which He has given, have come to be regarded\nby some as fanaticism.\nIf this attitude is preserved, then when the Lord shall again let\nHis light shine upon the people, they will turn from the heavenly\nillumination, saying, \u201cI felt the same in 1893, and some in whom I\nhave had confidence, said that the work was fanaticism.\u201d Will not\nthose who have received the rich grace of God, and who take the\nposition that the working of the Holy Spirit was fanaticism, be ready\nto denounce the operations of the Spirit of God in the future, and the\nheart thus be proof against the solicitations of the still, small voice?\nThe love of Jesus may be presented to those who thus barricade\nthemselves against it, and exercise no constraining power upon them.\nThe riches of the grace of heaven may be bestowed and yet rejected,\nSafeguarding the New Experience 133\ninstead of being cherished and gratefully recognized.

Quite a number arose.\u2014Diary, June 9, 1873.\nAfter Some Hesitancy a Response\nI spoke in the afternoon [at Stanley, Va.] from John 17:3. The\nLord gave me much of His Holy Spirit. The house was full. I\ncalled those forward who wished to seek the Lord more earnestly\nand for those who wished to give themselves to the Lord a whole\nsacrifice. For a time not one made a move, but after a while many\ncame forward and bore testimonies of confession. We had a precious [146]\nseason of prayer and all felt broken down, weeping and confessing\ntheir sins. O that each may understand!\u2014Diary, November 9, 1890.\nAs She Begins Work in Switzerland\nSabbath and Sunday were precious seasons. [At the Swiss\nConference held in Basel, Switzerland, in 1885.] The Lord\nespecially blessed (me) in speaking Sunday afternoon. At the close\nof the discourse an invitation was given for all who desired to be\nChristians, and all who felt that they had not a living connection\nwith God, to come forward, that we might unite our prayers with\ntheirs for the pardon of sin, and for grace to resist temptation.\n136 Selected Messages Book 1\nThis was a new experience for many, but they did not hesitate.\nIt seemed that the entire congregation were on their feet, and the\nbest they could do was to be seated, and all seek the Lord together.\nHere was an entire congregation manifesting their determination to\nput away sin, and to engage most earnestly in the work of seeking\nGod. After prayer, one hundred and fifteen testimonies were borne.\nMany of these showed a genuine experience in the things of God.\u2014\nHistorical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day\nAdventists, 173.\nAt Christiana [Oslo], Norway\nWe spent two weeks in Christiana, and labored earnestly for\nthe church. The Spirit of the Lord moved me to bear a very plain\ntestimony. At our last meeting especially, I presented before them\nthe necessity of a thorough change in the character if they would\nbe children of God.... I urged upon them the necessity of deep\nrepentance, confession, and forsaking of the sins which had shut\naway the sweet spirit of Christ from the church. We then called\nfor those to come forward who would take a decided position on\nthe Lord\u2019s side. Many responded. Some good confessions were\nmade, and earnest testimonies were borne.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nOctober 19, 1886.\nDetermination Indicated by Standing[147]\nA request was made [at Basel, Switzerland] for all who would\nfrom this time make most earnest efforts to reach a higher standard\nto arise. All arose. We hope this now will have the effect to win\nthem to God and to heavenly reflections and make earnest efforts\nto be all that God has given them power to be\u2014faithful and true\ndevoted soldiers of the cross of Christ.\u2014Diary, November 22, 1885.\nBacksliders Reclaimed in Basel\nIn the afternoon of the Sabbath we assembled again for social\nmeeting. The blessing of the Lord rested upon me as I again ad-\ndressed the people for a short time. Every seat was full and extra\nseats were brought in. All listened with deep interest.\nSpecial Appeals in Public Ministry 137\nI invited those who desired the prayers of the servants of God\nto come forward. All who had been backslidden, all who wished\nto return to the Lord and seek Him diligently, could improve the\nopportunity. Several seats were quickly filled and the whole congre-\ngation was on the move. We told them the best they could do was\nto be seated right where they were and we would all seek the Lord\ntogether by confessing our sins, and the Lord had pledged His word,\n\u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,\nand to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nMany testimonies were borne in quick succession and with depth\nof feelings, showing that the hearts were touched by the Spirit of\nGod. Our meetings continued from two o\u2019clock P.M. to five, and\nthen we were obliged to close, with several earnest prayers.\u2014Diary,\nFebruary 20, 1887.\nAn Outstanding Experience in Australia\nOn Sabbath, May 25 [1895], we had a precious meeting in the\nhall where our people meet at North Fitzroy. For several days before\nthe meeting, I knew that I was expected to speak in the church on\nSabbath; but unfortunately I had a severe cold and was quite hoarse.\nI felt inclined to excuse myself from this appointment; but as it was [148]\nmy only opportunity, I said, \u201cI will place myself before the people,\nand I believe the Lord will answer my earnest prayers, and remove\nthe hoarseness so that I can present my message to the people.\u201d I\npresented to my heavenly Father the promise, \u201cAsk, and it shall be\ngiven you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened\nunto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh\nfindeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.... If ye, then,\nbeing evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how\nmuch more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them\nthat ask him?\u201d (Luke 11:9-13)....\nThe word of God is sure. I had asked, and I believed that I would\nbe enabled to speak to the people. I selected a portion of Scripture;\nbut when I rose to speak, it was taken from my mind, and I felt\nimpressed to speak from the first chapter of second Peter. The Lord\ngave me special freedom in presenting the value of the grace of\n138 Selected Messages Book 1\nGod.... I was enabled by the aid of the Holy Spirit to speak with\nclearness and power.\nAt the close of my discourse, I felt impressed by the Spirit of God\nto extend an invitation for all those to come forward who desired\nto give themselves fully to the Lord. Those who felt the need of\nthe prayers of the servants of God were invited to make it manifest.\nAbout thirty came forward. Among those were the wives of the\nBrethren F, who for the first time made manifest their desire to come\nnear to God. My heart was filled with unspeakable gratitude because\nof the movement made by these two women.\nI could then see why I was so earnestly moved to make this\ninvitation. At first I had hesitated, wondering if it were best to do so\nwhen my son and I were the only ones whom I could see who would\ngive us any help on that occasion. But as though someone had spoken\nto me, the thought passed through my mind, \u201cCannot you trust in the\nLord?\u201d I said, \u201cI will, Lord.\u201d Although my son was much surprised\nthat I should make such a call on this occasion, he was equal to the\nemergency. I never heard him speak with greater power or deeper\nfeeling than at this time. He called upon Brethren Faulkhead and[149]\nSalisbury to come forward, and we knelt in prayer. My son took\nthe lead, and the Lord surely indited his petition; for he seemed to\npray as though in the presence of God. Brethren Faulkhead and\nSalisbury also presented fervent petitions, and then the Lord gave\nme a voice to pray. I remembered the Sisters F, who, for the first\ntime, were taking a public stand for the truth. The Holy Spirit was\nin the meeting, and many were stirred by its deep movings.\nAt the close of the meeting many pressed their way to the plat-\nform, and taking me by the hand, requested me with tears in their\neyes to pray for them. I answered heartily, \u201cI will.\u201d The Sisters\nF were introduced to me, and I found that their hearts were very\ntender.... The mother of one of the sisters who has now taken her\nposition on the truth, has been a most bitter opposer, and has threat-\nened that if her daughter did become a Sabbathkeeper, she would\nnot allow her to enter her home; for the mother would look upon her\nas a disgrace to the family. Mrs. F had often made the statement\nthat she would never join the Seventh-day Adventists. She had been\nbrought up in the Presbyterian Church, and had been educated to\nthink that it was very improper for women to speak in meeting, and\nSpecial Appeals in Public Ministry 139\nthat for a woman to preach was altogether beyond the bounds of\npropriety. She enjoyed hearing Elders Daniells and Corliss, and\nthought them very clever speakers, but she would not listen to a\nwoman\u2019s preaching. Her husband had prayed that God would so\narrange matters that she might be converted under the ministry of\nSister White. When I made the appeal, and urged those to come\nforward who felt their need of drawing nearer to God, to the surprise\nof all, these sisters came forward. The sister who had lost her little\none, said that she was determined that she would not move forward,\nbut the Spirit of the Lord so forcibly impressed her mind that she\ndared not refuse.... I feel so grateful to my heavenly Father for His\nlovingkindness in bringing these two precious souls to unite with\ntheir husbands in obeying the truth.\u2014The Review and Herald, July\n30, 1895.\nNon-Adventist Visitors Respond at Ashfield Church [150]\nI invited all who wanted to give themselves to God in a sacred\ncovenant, and to serve Him with their whole hearts, to rise to their\nfeet. The house was full, and nearly all rose. Quite a number not\nof our faith were present, and some of these arose. I presented\nthem to the Lord in earnest prayer, and we know that we had the\nmanifestation of the Spirit of God. We felt that a victory had indeed\nbeen gained.\u2014Manuscript 30a, 1896.\nThe Special Call at the Battle Creek College\nI have now spoken to the helpers, nursing class, and physicians\nfive times during the Week of Prayer, and I am sure my talks are\nappreciated. I have spoken in the college twice. Last Thursday\nProfessor Prescott wished me to come over there. I went and prayed\nand spoke to the large chapel filled with students. I had much\nfreedom in speaking and in presenting before them the goodness\nand mercy of God and the great condescension and sacrifice of Jesus\nChrist and the heavenly reward purchased for us, the last final victory,\nand what a privilege it is to be Christians.\nProfessor Prescott arose and attempted to speak, but his heart\nwas full and he did not utter a word for five minutes, but stood\nweeping before the people. Then he said a few words, \u201cI am glad\n140 Selected Messages Book 1\nthat I am a Christian.\u201d He talked for about five minutes, then he gave\nliberty for all to speak. Many testimonies were borne, but it seemed\nto me that there must be a company reached that we had not yet\nsucceeded in reaching. We called all to come forward who felt that\nthey were unready for Christ\u2019s coming and had not an evidence of\ntheir acceptance with God. I thought the whole house was in motion.\nWe then gave opportunity for all to express their feelings, but we had\nafter a little another season of prayer and the blessing of the Lord\nseemed to reach hearts.\nThen we separated into divisions and continued the work for\ntwo hours longer, and the Lord\u2019s Spirit came into the meeting in\na remarkable manner. Several of those who had known nothing[151]\nof a religious faith, unbelievers from the world, have obtained a\ngenuine experience in the religious life. And the work is going\ndeeper and deeper. The Lord is at work and will work, as fast as we\nprepare the way for Him that He can safely reveal His power in our\nbehalf.\u2014Letter 75, 1888.\nCalled Forward in San Francisco\nFriday, December 21 [1900], I went to San Francisco, where\nI was to spend the Week of Prayer. Sabbath afternoon I spoke to\nthe church there, although I was so weak that I had to cling to\nthe pulpit with both hands to steady myself. I asked the Lord to\ngive me strength to speak to the people. He heard my prayer, and\nstrengthened me. I had great freedom in speaking from Revelation\n2:1-5.\nThe deep moving of the Spirit of God came upon me, and the\npeople were strongly impressed with the message borne. After I\nhad finished speaking, all who desired to give themselves to the\nLord were invited to come forward. A large number responded, and\nprayer was offered for them. Several who came forward are persons\nwho have recently heard the Advent message, and are in the valley\nof decision. May the Lord strengthen the good impression made\nupon them, and may they give themselves wholly to Him. Oh, how\nI long to see souls converted, and hear them sing a new song, even\npraise to our God!\nSpecial Appeals in Public Ministry 141\nSunday afternoon I spoke to a large audience, many of whom are\nnot of our faith. My strength was renewed, and I was able, without\nclinging to the desk, to stand before the people. The Lord\u2019s blessing\nrested upon us, and increased strength came to me as I spoke. As on\nSabbath, those seeking spiritual help were invited to come forward,\nand we were glad to see the ready response. The Lord came very\nnear as we sought Him in prayer.\u2014The Review and Herald, February\n19, 1901.\nA Similar Work in Every Church\nSabbath, November 10, I visited San Francisco, and spoke to a\nchurch full of people who had ears to hear and hearts to understand.... [152]\nAfter I had finished speaking, Elder Corliss invited all who wished\nto give themselves to Jesus to come forward. There was a quick\nand happy response, and I was told that nearly two hundred persons\ncame forward. Men and women, youth and children, pressed into\nthe front seats. The Lord would be pleased to have a work similar to\nthis done in every church.\nMany could not come forward, because the house was so\ncrowded, yet the animated countenances and tearful eyes testified\nto the determination, \u201cI will be on the Lord\u2019s side. From this time I\nwill seek earnestly to reach a higher standard.\u201d\u2014The Review and\nHerald, February 12, 1901.\nResponse at General Conference of 1909\nMy brethren and sisters, seek the Lord while He may be found.\nThere is a time coming when those who have wasted their time and\nopportunities will wish they had sought Him.... He wants you to\nkeep in the line of reason, and in the line of labor. He wants you to\ngo forth to our churches to labor earnestly for Him. He wants you to\ninstitute meetings for those outside of the churches, that they may\nlearn the truths of this last message of warning. There are places\nwhere you will be gladly received, where souls will thank you for\ncoming to their help. May the Lord help you to take hold of this\nwork as you have never yet taken hold of it. Will you do this? Will\nyou here rise to your feet and testify that you will make God your\ntrust and your helper? [Congregation rises.]\n142 Selected Messages Book 1\n[Praying] I thank thee, Lord God of Israel. Accept this pledge of\nthis Thy people. Put Thy Spirit upon them. Let Thy glory be seen in\nthem. As they shall speak the word of truth, let us see the salvation\nof God. Amen.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, May 18, 1909.\nSection 4\u2014\u201cPreach the Word\u201d [153]\n[154]\nIntroduction\n- As in the year 1933 the General Conference leadership made\nplans for strong evangelistic emphasis and effort throughout North\nAmerica, it was realized that if large objectives were to be accom-\nplished, the ministers who stood before the people must turn from\nsubjects of minor importance to the presentation of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage in its broad and gripping phases. At the request of the Gen-\neral Conference a sixteen-page pamphlet entitled \u201cPreach the Word,\u201d\ncontaining Ellen G. White counsels, was published. Great good was\naccomplished by the many thousands of copies distributed, charging\nthe ministry anew with the solemn responsibility of proclaiming\nthe last judgment-hour message to the world. Those portions not in\nother E. G. White books are included in permanent form here. The\nstatements printed do not constitute an exhaustive compilation of\nwhat Ellen White has written on this subject. Additional counsel\nmay be found in the booksEvangelism, Gospel Workers, Testimonies\nto Ministers, and Christian Service.\nFollowing the pamphlet items are a few related chapters. \u201cThe\nPeril of Extreme Views\u201d is a communication addressed to one of our\nministers, containing instruction of great service, which until now\nhas been available only in Notebook Leaflets. The chapter on \u201cTime\nSetting\u201d is pertinent. The section closes with counsels drawn from\nSpecial Testimonies, Series B, No. 2, written during the crisis of\n1903 and 1904 when certain pantheistic views were being pressed\nupon the denomination as new light which, it was asserted, would\nprove a great blessing to the church. The chief blessing that resulted\nfrom this crisis was in the lessons in truth so earnestly communicated\nby the Lord\u2019s messenger to the struggling church, found mainly in\nTestimonies, V olume 8, andThe Ministry of Healing.\nWhite Trustees.\n144\nChapter 19\u2014What to Preach and Not to Preach\n[No complete listing of topics is here attempted.

The exaltation of Christ is the great truth that all who\nlabor in word and doctrine are to reveal.\u2014Manuscript 109, 1897.\nLaborers in the cause of truth should present the righteousness\nof Christ, not as new light, but as precious light that has for a time\nbeen lost sight of by the people. We are to accept of Christ as our\npersonal Saviour, and He imputes unto us the righteousness of God\nin Christ. Let us repeat and make prominent the truth that John has\nportrayed, \u201cHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved\nus, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins\u201d (1 John 4:10).\nIn the love of God has been opened the most marvelous vein of\nprecious truth, and the treasures of the grace of Christ are laid open\nbefore the church and the world.... What love is this, what marvelous,\nunfathomable love that would lead Christ to die for us while we were\nyet sinners. What a loss it is to the soul who understands the strong [156]\nclaims of the law, and who yet fails to understand the grace of Christ\nwhich doth much more abound.\nIt is true that the law of God reveals the love of God when it is\npreached as the truth in Jesus, for the gift of Christ to this guilty world\nmust be largely dwelt upon in every discourse. It is no wonder that\nhearts have not been melted by the truth, when it has been presented\nin a cold and lifeless manner. No wonder faith has staggered at the\npromises of God, when ministers and workers have failed to present\nJesus in His relation to the law of God. How often should they\n145\n146 Selected Messages Book 1\nhave assured the people that \u201che that spared not his own Son, but\ndelivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely\ngive us all things?\u201d (Romans 8:32).\nSatan is determined that men shall not see the love of God which\nled Him to give His only-begotten Son to save a lost race; for it is\nthe goodness of God that leads men to repentance. O how shall we\nsucceed in setting forth before the world the deep, precious love\nof God? In no other way we can compass it except by exclaiming,\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called the sons of God\u201d (1 John 3:1). Let us say\nto sinners, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of\nthe world\u201d (John 1:29). By presenting Jesus as the representative\nof the Father, we shall be able to dispel the shadow that Satan has\ncast upon our pathway, in order that we shall not see the mercy and\ninexpressible love of God as manifested in Jesus Christ. Look at the\ncross of Calvary. It is a standing pledge of the boundless love, the\nmeasureless mercy of the heavenly Father.\u2014Manuscript 154, 1897.\nThe Holy Spirit\nChrist, the Great Teacher, had an infinite variety of subjects from\nwhich to choose, but the one upon which He dwelt most largely was\nthe endowment of the Holy Spirit. What great things He predicted\nfor the church because of this endowment. Yet what subject is less\ndwelt upon now? What promise is less fulfilled? An occasional[157]\ndiscourse is given upon the Holy Spirit, and then the subject is left\nfor after consideration.\u2014Manuscript 20, 1891.\nTeach Steps in Conversion\nMinisters need to have a more clear, simple manner in presenting\nthe truth as it is in Jesus. Their own minds need to comprehend the\ngreat plan of salvation more fully. Then they can carry the minds\nof the hearers away from earthly things to the spiritual and eternal.\nThere are many who want to know what they must do to be saved.\nThey want a plain and clear explanation of the steps requisite in\nconversion, and there should not a sermon be given unless a portion\nof that discourse is to especially make plain the way that sinners\nmay come to Christ and be saved. They should point them to Christ,\nWhat to Preach and Not to Preach 147\nas did John, and with touching simplicity, their hearts aglow with the\nlove of Christ, say, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away\nthe sin of the world.\u201d Strong and earnest appeals should be made to\nthe sinner to repent and be converted.\nThose who neglect this part of the work need to be converted\nthemselves before venturing to give a discourse. Those whose hearts\nare filled with the love of Jesus, with the precious truths of His Word,\nwill be able to draw from the treasure house of God things new and\nold. They will not find time to relate anecdotes; they will not strain\nto become orators, soaring so high that they cannot carry the people\nwith them; but in simple language, with touching earnestness, they\nwill present the truth as it is in Jesus.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nFebruary 22, 1887.\nRevival of Old Advent Truths\nThere is a work of sacred importance for ministers and people\nto do. They are to study the history of the cause and people of God.\nThey are not to forget the past dealing of God with His people. They\nare to revive and recount the truths that have come to seem of little\nvalue to those who do not know by personal experience of the power\nand brightness that accompanied them when they were first seen and [158]\nunderstood. In all their original freshness and power these truths are\nto be given to the world.\u2014Manuscript 22, 1890.\nThe Ministration of Angels\nOver every man good and evil angels strive. It is the man himself\nwho determines which shall win. I call upon the ministers of Christ\nto press home upon the understanding of all who come within the\nreach of their voice, the truth of the ministration of angels. Do not\nindulge in fanciful speculations. The written Word is our only safety.\nWe must pray as did Daniel, that we may be guarded by heavenly\nintelligences.\u2014Letter 201, 1899.\nArgumentative Sermons\nThe many argumentative sermons preached, seldom soften and\nsubdue the soul.... It should be the burden of every messenger\nto set forth the fullness of Christ. When the free gift of Christ\u2019s\n148 Selected Messages Book 1\nrighteousness is not presented, the discourses are dry and spiritless;\nthe sheep and lambs are not fed. Said Paul, \u201cMy speech and my\npreaching was not with enticing words of man\u2019s wisdom, but in\ndemonstration of the Spirit and of power\u201d (1 Corinthians 2:4). There\nis marrow and fatness in the gospel. Jesus is the living center of\neverything. Put Christ into every sermon. Let the preciousness,\nmercy, and glory of Jesus Christ be dwelt upon; for Christ formed\nwithin is the hope of glory.\u2014Letter 15, 1892.\nPresent Truth in Meekness\nBe careful messengers. Do not be anxious to hear and accept\nnew theories, for often they are such as should never be presented\nbefore any congregation. Speak no boastful, self-exalting words.\nLet the Word of God come forth from lips that are sanctified by\nthe truth. Every minister is to preach the truth as it is in Jesus. He\nshould be assured of that which he affirms, and should handle the\nWord of God under the direction of the Holy Spirit of God. Walk\nand work carefully before God, my brethren, that no soul may be[159]\nled into deception by your example. It had been better for you never\nto have been born than that you should lead one soul astray.\nThose who profess to be servants of God need to make diligent\nwork for the obtaining of that life where sin and sickness and sorrow\ncannot enter. They are to be instant in season and out of season.\nGod is calling for reformers who will speak strong, uplifting\nwords from our pulpits. It is when men speak their own words in\ntheir own strength, instead of preaching the Word of God in the\npower of the Spirit, that they are hurt and offended when their words\nare not received with enthusiasm. It is then that they are tempted\nto speak words that will arouse a spirit of bitterness and opposition\nin their hearers. My brethren, be advised. Such words are not to\ncome from the lips of Christ\u2019s ambassadors. Sanctified lips will\nspeak words that reform, but do not exasperate. The truth is to be\npresented in the meekness and love of Christ.\u2014Letter 348, 1907.\nA Device of the Enemy\nWe are to pray for divine enlightenment, but at the same time we\nshould be careful how we receive everything termed new light. We\nWhat to Preach and Not to Preach 149\nmust beware lest, under cover of searching for new truth, Satan shall\ndivert our minds from Christ and the special truths for this time. I\nhave been shown that it is the device of the enemy to lead minds to\ndwell upon some obscure or unimportant point, something that is not\nfully revealed or is not essential to our salvation. This is made the\nabsorbing theme, the \u201cpresent truth,\u201d when all their investigations\nand suppositions only serve to make matters more obscure than\nbefore, and to confuse the minds of some who ought to be seeking\nfor oneness through sanctification of the truth.\u2014Letter 7, 1891.\nHuman Suppositions and Conjectures\nLet no one present beautiful, scientific sophistries to lull the\npeople of God to sleep. Clothe not the solemn, sacred truth for [160]\nthis time in any fantastic dress of man\u2019s wisdom. Let those who\nhave been doing this stop and cry unto God to save their souls from\ndeceiving fables.\nIt is the living energy of the Holy Spirit that will move hearts,\nnot pleasing, deceptive theories. Fanciful representations are not the\nbread of life; they cannot save the soul from sin.\nChrist was sent from heaven to redeem humanity. He taught the\ndoctrines that God gave Him to teach. The truths that He proclaimed,\nas found in the Old Testament and the New, we today are to proclaim\nas the word of the living God.\nLet those who want the bread of life go to the Scriptures, not to\nthe teaching of finite, erring man. Give the people the bread of life\nthat Christ came from heaven to bring to us. Do not mix with your\nteaching human suppositions and conjectures. Would that all knew\nhow much they need to eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son\nof God\u2014to make His words a part of their very lives.\u2014Manuscript\n44, 1904.\nOur Faith Founded on Truth\nI long daily to be able to do double duty. I have been pleading\nwith the Lord for strength and wisdom to reproduce the writings\nof the witnesses who were confirmed in the faith and in the early\nhistory of the message. After the passing of the time in 1844 they\nreceived the light and walked in the light, and when the men claiming\n150 Selected Messages Book 1\nto have new light would come in with their wonderful messages\nregarding various points of Scripture, we had, through the moving\nof the Holy Spirit, testimonies right to the point, which cut off the\ninfluence of such messages as Elder G has been devoting his time to\npresenting. [Reference is here made to teachings on the sanctuary\nquestion\u2014at variance with those held by Seventh-day Adventists\nthrough the years\u2014which denied the fulfillment of prophecy in 1844\nand repudiated the ministry of Christ in the investigative judgment.\u2014\nCompilers.] This poor man has been working decidedly against the\ntruth that the Holy Spirit has confirmed.\nWhen the power of God testifies as to what is truth, that truth[161]\nis to stand forever as the truth. No after suppositions contrary to\nthe light God has given are to be entertained. Men will arise with\ninterpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are\nnot truth. The truth for this time God has given us as a foundation\nfor our faith. He Himself has taught us what is truth. One will\narise, and still another, with new light, which contradicts the light\nthat God has given under the demonstration of His Holy Spirit. A\nfew are still alive who passed through the experience gained in the\nestablishment of this truth. God has graciously spared their lives to\nrepeat, and repeat till the close of their lives, the experience through\nwhich they passed even as did John the apostle till the very close of\nhis life. And the standard bearers who have fallen in death are to\nspeak through the reprinting of their writings. I am instructed that\nthus their voices are to be heard. They are to bear their testimony as\nto what constitutes the truth for this time.\nWe are not to receive the words of those who come with a mes-\nsage that contradicts the special points of our faith. They gather\ntogether a mass of Scripture, and pile it as proof around their as-\nserted theories. This has been done over and over again during the\npast fifty years. And while the Scriptures are God\u2019s word, and are to\nbe respected, the application of them, if such application moves one\npillar from the foundation that God has sustained these fifty years,\nis a great mistake. He who makes such an application knows not\nthe wonderful demonstration of the Holy Spirit that gave power and\nforce to the past messages that have come to the people of God.\nElder G\u2019s proofs are not reliable. If received, they would destroy\nthe faith of God\u2019s people in the truth that has made us what we are.\nWhat to Preach and Not to Preach 151\nWe must be decided on this subject; for the points that he is\ntrying to prove by Scripture, are not sound. They do not prove that\nthe past experience of God\u2019s people was a fallacy. We had the truth;\nwe were directed by the angels of God. It was under the guidance\nof the Holy Spirit that the presentation of the sanctuary question [162]\nwas given. It is eloquence for every one to keep silent in regard\nto the features of our faith in which they acted no part. God never\ncontradicts Himself. Scripture proofs are misapplied if forced to\ntestify to that which is not true. Another and still another will arise\nand bring in supposedly great light, and make their assertions. But\nwe stand by the old landmarks. [1 John 1:1-10 quoted.]\nI am instructed to say that these words we may use as appropriate\nfor this time, for the time has come when sin must be called by its\nright name. We are hindered in our work by men who are not\nconverted, who seek their own glory. They wish to be thought\noriginators of new theories, which they present claiming that they\nare truth. But if these theories are received, they will lead to a\ndenial of the truth that for the past fifty years God has been giving\nto His people, substantiating it by the demonstration of the Holy\nSpirit.\u2014Letter 329, 1905.\nThe Truths That Have Been Revealed\n\u201cStudy to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that\nneedeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d Learn\nto take the truths that have been revealed, and to handle them in such\na way that they will be food for the flock of God.\nWe shall meet those who allow their minds to wander into idle\nspeculations about things of which nothing is said in the Word of\nGod. God has spoken in the plainest language upon every subject\nthat affects the salvation of the soul. But He desires us to avoid all\nday dreaming, and He says, Go work today in my vineyard. The\nnight cometh wherein no man can work. Cease all idle curiosity;\nwatch, and work, and pray. Study the truths that have been revealed.\nChrist desires to break up all vacant reveries, and He points us to the\nfields ripe for the harvest. Unless we work earnestly, eternity will\noverwhelm us with its burden of responsibility\n152 Selected Messages Book 1\nIn the days of the apostles the most foolish heresies were pre-\nsented as truth. History has been and will be repeated. There will[163]\nalways be those who, though apparently conscientious, will grasp\nat the shadow, preferring it to the substance. They take error in\nthe place of truth, because error is clothed with a new garment,\nwhich they think covers something wonderful. But let the covering\nbe removed, and nothingness appears.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nFebruary 5, 1901.\nQuestions of Eternal Import\nDwell upon the lessons that Christ dwelt upon. Present them\nto the people as He presented them. Dwell upon questions that\nconcern our eternal welfare. Anything that the enemy can devise to\ndivert the mind from God\u2019s Word, anything new and strange that he\ncan originate to create a diversity of sentiment, he will introduce as\nsomething wonderfully important. But those things that we cannot\nclearly comprehend are not a tenth as important to us as are the\ntruths of God\u2019s Word that we can clearly comprehend and bring into\nour daily life. We are to teach the people the lessons that Christ\nbrought into His teachings from the Old Testament Scriptures. The\nlanguage of divine truth is exceedingly plain.\u2014Letter 16, 1903.\nPoints Unnecessary for Faith\nThere are many questions treated upon that are not necessary for\nthe perfection of the faith. We have no time for their study. Many\nthings are above finite comprehension. Truths are to be received not\nwithin the reach of our reason, and not for us to explain. Revelation\npresents them to us to be implicitly received as the words of an\ninfinite God. While every ingenious inquirer is to search out the\ntruth as it is in Jesus, there are things not yet simplified, statements\nthat human minds cannot grasp and reason out, without being liable\nto make human calculation and explanations, which will not prove a\nsavor of life unto life.\nBut every truth which is essential for us to bring into our practical\nlife, which concerns the salvation of the soul, is made very clear and\npositive.\u2014Letter 8, 1895.\nChapter 20\u2014Our Attitude Toward Doctrinal [164]\nControversy\n\u201cThe Daily\u201d of Daniel Eight\nI have words to speak to my brethren east and west, north and\nsouth. I request that my writings shall not be used as the leading\nargument to settle questions over which there is now so much contro-\nversy. I entreat of Elders H, I, J, and others of our leading brethren,\nthat they make no reference to my writings to sustain their views of\n\u201cthe daily.\u201d\nIt has been presented to me that this is not a subject of vital\nimportance. I am instructed that our brethren are making a mistake\nin magnifying the importance of the difference in the views that\nare held. I cannot consent that any of my writings shall be taken\nas settling this matter. The true meaning of \u201cthe daily\u201d is not to be\nmade a test question.\nI now ask that my ministering brethren shall not make use of my\nwritings in their arguments regarding this question [\u201cthe daily\u201d]; for\nI have had no instruction on the point under discussion, and I see\nno need for the controversy. Regarding this matter under present\nconditions, silence is eloquence.\nThe enemy of our work is pleased when a subject of minor\nimportance can be used to divert the minds of our brethren from the [165]\ngreat questions that should be the burden of our message. As this is\nnot a test question, I entreat of my brethren that they shall not allow\nthe enemy to triumph by having it treated as such.\nThe True Testing Questions\nThe work that the Lord has given us at this time is to present to\nthe people the true light in regard to the testing questions of obedi-\nence and salvation\u2014the commandments of God and the testimony\nof Jesus Christ.\n153\n154 Selected Messages Book 1\nIn some of our important books that have been in print for years,\nand which have brought many to a knowledge of the truth, there\nmay be found matters of minor importance that call for careful study\nand correction. Let such matters be considered by those regularly\nappointed to have the oversight of our publications. Let not these\nbrethren, nor our canvassers, nor our ministers magnify these matters\nin such a way as to lessen the influence of these good soul-saving\nbooks. Should we take up the work of discrediting our literature, we\nwould place weapons in the hands of those who have departed from\nthe faith and confuse the minds of those who have newly embraced\nthe message. The less that is done unnecessarily to change our\npublications, the better it will be.\nIn the night seasons I seem to be repeating to my brethren in\nresponsible positions, words from the First Epistle of John. [Chapter\n1 is quoted.]\nA Daily Conversion\nOur brethren should understand that self needs to be humbled\nand brought under the control of the Holy Spirit. The Lord calls\nupon those of us who have had great light to be converteddaily. This\nis the message I have to bear to our editors and to the presidents of\nall our conferences. We must walk in the light while we have the\nlight, lest darkness come upon us.\nAll who are led by the Holy Spirit of God will have a message\nfor this last time. With mind and heart they will be carrying a burden\nfor souls, and they will bear the heavenly message of Christ to those[166]\nwith whom they associate. Those who in speech act as the Gentiles\nact, cannot be introduced into the heavenly courts. My brethren,\nreceive the light, redeeming the time because the days are evil.\nSatan is busily working with all who will give him encourage-\nment. Those who have the light, but refuse to walk in it, will become\nconfused, until darkness pervades their souls, and shapes their whole\ncourse of action. But the spirit of wisdom and goodness of God\nas revealed in His Word, will become brighter and brighter as they\nfollow on in the path of true obedience. All the righteous demands\nof God will be met through sanctification of the Holy Spirit.. . .\nOur Attitude Toward Doctrinal Controversy 155\nThere are great privileges and blessings for all who will humble\nthemselves and fully consecrate their hearts to God. Great light will\nbe given to them. When men are willing to be transformed, then\nthey will be exercised unto godliness.\n\u201cAnd of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace\u201d\n(John 1:16). \u201cMy grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made\nperfect in weakness\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:9). Says the Saviour: \u201cAll\npower is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and\nteach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of\nthe Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things\nwhatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway,\neven unto the end of the world\u201d (Matthew 28:18-20).\nShall this wealth of grace and power for service continue among\nus to be unappreciated and turned from without relish or appetite?\nThe instruction I am bidden to give to our people now is the same\nas I gave while in Washington. The Lord calls for individual effort.\nOne cannot do the work of another. Great light has been shining,\nbut it has not been fully comprehended and received.\nIf our brethren will now consecrate themselves unreservedly to\nGod, He will accept them. He will give them a transformation of\nmind, that they may be savors of life unto life. Wake up, brethren\nand sisters, that you may attain to your high calling through Christ\nJesus our Lord.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1910.\nNot a Test Question [167]\nTo My Brethren in the Ministry:\nDear Fellow Workers,\nI have words to speak to ... all who have been active in urging\ntheir views in regard to the meaning of \u201cthe daily\u201d of Daniel 8.\nThis is not to be made a test question, and the agitation that has\nresulted from its being treated as such has been very unfortunate.\nConfusion has resulted, and the minds of some of our brethren have\nbeen diverted from the thoughtful consideration that should have\nbeen given to the work that the Lord has directed should be done at\nthis time in our cities. This has been pleasing to the great enemy of\nour work.\n156 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe light given me is that nothing should be done to increase\nthe agitation upon this question. Let it not be brought into our\ndiscourses, and dwelt upon as a matter of great importance. We have\na great work before us, and we have not an hour to lose from the\nessential work to be done. Let us confine our public efforts to the\npresentation of the important lines of truth on which we are united,\nand on which we have clear light.\nI would bring to your attention the last prayer of Christ, as\nrecorded in John 17. There are many subjects upon which we can\nspeak\u2014sacred, testing truths, beautiful in their simplicity. On these\nyou may dwell with intense earnestness. But let not \u201cthe daily,\u201d or\nany other subject that will arouse controversy among brethren, be\nbrought in at this time; for this will delay and hinder the work that\nthe Lord would have the minds of our brethren centered upon just\nnow. Let us not agitate questions that will reveal a marked difference\nof opinion, but rather let us bring from the Word the sacred truths\nregarding the binding claims of the law of God.\nOur ministers should seek to make the most favorable presenta-\ntion of truth. So far as possible, let all speak the same things. Let\nthe discourses be simple, and treating upon vital subjects that can\nbe easily understood. When all our ministers see the necessity of\nhumbling themselves, then the Lord can work with them. We need[168]\nnow to be reconverted, that angels of God may cooperate with us,\nmaking a sacred impression upon the minds of those for whom we\nlabor.\nDraw in Even Cords\nWe must blend together in the bonds of Christlike unity; then our\nlabors will not be in vain. Draw in even cords, and let no contentions\nbe brought in. Reveal the unifying power of truth, and this will make\na powerful impression on human minds. In unity there is strength.\nThis is not a time to make prominent unimportant points of\ndifference. If some who have not had a strong living connection\nwith the Master reveal to the world their weakness of Christian\nexperience, the enemies of the truth, who are watching us closely,\nwill make the most of it, and our work will be hindered. Let all\nOur Attitude Toward Doctrinal Controversy 157\ncultivate meekness, and learn lessons from Him who is meek and\nlowly in heart.\nThe subject of \u201cthe daily\u201d should not call forth such movements\nas have been made. As a result of the way this subject has been\nhandled by men on both sides of the question, controversy has\narisen and confusion has resulted.... While the present condition\nof difference of opinion regarding this subject exists let it not be\nmade prominent. Let all contention cease. At such a time silence is\neloquence.\nThe duty of God\u2019s servants at this time is to preach the Word\nin the cities. Christ came from the heavenly courts to this earth\nin order to save souls and we, as almoners of His grace, need to\nimpart to the inhabitants of the great cities a knowledge of His saving\ntruth.\u2014Letter 62, 1910.\nChapter 21\u2014Fanciful or Speculative Teachings[169]\nNo Compromise\nI must bear a decided message to our brethren. Let there be no\ncompromise with evil. Meet boldly the dangerous influences that\narise. Do not fear for the results of resisting the powers of the enemy.\nIn these days many deceptions are being taught as truth. Some of\nour brethren have taught views which we cannot endorse. Fanciful\nideas, strained and peculiar interpretations of the Scripture are com-\ning in. Some of these teachings may seem to be but jots and tittles\nnow, but they will grow and become snares to the inexperienced.\nWe have a decided work to do. Let not the enemy cause us to\nswerve from the proclamation of the definite truth for this time, and\nturn our attention to fanciful ideas.\nUnless we are individually wide awake to discern the workings\nof the Holy Spirit, we shall certainly stumble and fall into Satan\u2019s\npitfalls of unbelief. I call upon our brethren to watch as faithful\nshepherds and guardians over the inexperienced, who are exposed\nto the wiles of seductive influences. Keep a continual lookout for\nrocks and quicksands that threaten to destroy faith in the messages\nthat God has given for us at this time. Watch for souls as they that\nmust give account....\nWe need to search the Scriptures daily, that we may know the[170]\nway of the Lord, and that we be not deceived by religious fallacies.\nThe world is full of false theories and seductive spiritualistic ideas,\nwhich tend to destroy clear spiritual perception, and to lead away\nfrom truth and holiness. Especially at this time do we need to heed\nthe warning, \u201cLet no man deceive you with vain words\u201d (Ephesians\n5:6).\nWe must be careful lest we misinterpret the Scriptures. The plain\nteachings of the Word of God are not to be so spiritualized that the\nreality is lost sight of. Do not overstrain the meaning of sentences in\nthe Bible in an effort to bring forth something odd in order to please\nthe fancy. Take the Scriptures as they read. Avoid idle speculation\n158\nFanciful or Speculative Teachings 159\nconcerning what will be in the kingdom of heaven.\u2014Manuscript 30,\n1904.\nA Life and Death Question\nLetters have come to me, asking in regard to the teaching of\nsome who say that nothing that has life should be killed, not even\ninsects, however annoying or distressing they may be. Is it possible\nthat anyone claims that God has given him this message to give\nto the people? The Lord has never given any human being such\na message. God has told no one that it is a sin to kill the insects\nwhich destroy our peace and rest. In all His teaching, Christ gave no\nmessage of this character, and His disciples are to teach only what\nHe commanded them.\nThere are those who are always seeking to engage in controversy.\nThis is the sum of their religion. They are filled with a desire to\nproduce something new and strange. They dwell upon matters of\nthe smallest consequence, exercising upon these their sharp, contro-\nversial talents.\nIdle tales are brought in as important truths, and by some they\nare actually set up as tests. Thus controversy is created, and minds\nare diverted from present truth. Satan knows that if he can get men\nand women absorbed in trifling details, greater questions will be left\nunheeded. He will furnish plenty of material for the attention of those\nwho are willing to think upon trifling, unimportant subjects. The [171]\nminds of the Pharisees were absorbed with questions of no moment.\nThey passed by the precious truths of God\u2019s Word to discuss the\ntraditionary lore handed down from generation to generation, which\nin no way concerned their salvation. And so today, while precious\nmoments are passing into eternity, the great questions of salvation\nare overlooked for some idle tale.\nI would say to my brethren and sisters, Keep close to the in-\nstruction found in the Word of God. Dwell upon the rich truths of\nthe Scriptures. Thus only can you become one in Christ. You have\nno time to engage in controversy regarding the killing of insects.\nJesus has not placed this burden upon you. \u201cWhat is the chaff to\nthe wheat?\u201d (Jeremiah 23:28). These side issues which arise are as\nhay, wood, and stubble compared with the truth for these last days.\n160 Selected Messages Book 1\nThose who leave the great truths of God\u2019s Word to speak of such\nmatters are not preaching the gospel. They are dealing with the idle\nsophistry which the enemy brings forward to divert minds from the\ntruths that concern their eternal welfare. They have no word from\nChrist to vindicate their suppositions.\nDo not spend your time in the discussion of such matters. If you\nhave any question as to what you should teach, any question as to\nthe subjects upon which you should dwell, go right to the discourses\nof the Great Teacher, and follow His instructions....\nDo not allow anything to draw your attention from the question,\n\u201cWhat shall I do to inherit eternal life?\u201d (Luke 10:25). This is a life\nand death question, which we must each settle for eternity. Let the\nmind be weighted with the importance of the solemn truth which we\npossess. Those who allow the mind to wander in search of cheap,\nunimportant theories need to be converted....\nErroneous theories, with no authority from the Word of God,\nwill come in on the right hand and the left, and to weaklings these\ntheories will appear as truth which makes wise. But they are as\nnothingness. And yet many church members have become so well\nsatisfied with cheap food that they have dyspeptic religion. Why will\nmen and women belittle their experience by gathering up idle tales[172]\nand presenting them as matters worthy of attention? The people\nof God have no time to dwell on the indefinite, frivolous questions\nwhich have no bearing on God\u2019s requirements.\nGod desires men and women to think soberly and candidly. They\nare to ascend to a higher and still higher grade, commanding a\nwider and still wider horizon. Looking unto Jesus, they are to be\nchanged into His image. They are to spend their time in searching\nfor the deep, everlasting truths of heaven. Then there will be nothing\nfrivolous in their religious experience. As they study the grand truths\nof God\u2019s Word, they endure the seeing of Him who is invisible. They\nsee that the most uplifting, ennobling truths are those most closely\nconnected with the Source of all truth. And as they learn of Him,\ntheir motives and sympathies become firm and unchanging; for the\nimpressions made by the All-wise are substantial and enduring. The\nliving water, which Christ gives, is not like a surface spring, which\nbabbles for a short time, and then dries up. The living water springs\nup unto everlasting life.\nFanciful or Speculative Teachings 161\nLet us follow the revealed will of God. Then we shall know\nthat the light we receive comes from the divine Source of all true\nlight. Those who cooperate with Christ are on safe ground. God\nrichly blesses them as they consecrate their energies to the work\nof rescuing the world from corruption. Christ is our example. By\nbeholding Him we are to be changed into His image, from glory\nto glory, from character to character. This is our work. God help\nus rightly to represent the Saviour to the world.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, August 13, 1901.\nConjectures Regarding the Future Life\nThere are men today who express their belief that there will be\nmarriages and births in the new earth; but those who believe the\nScriptures cannot accept such doctrines. The doctrine that children\nwill be born in the new earth is not a part of the \u201csure word of\nprophecy\u201d (2 Peter 1:19). The words of Christ are too plain to be\nmisunderstood. They should forever settle the question of marriages [173]\nand births in the new earth. Neither those who shall be raised from\nthe dead, nor those who shall be translated without seeing death,\nwill marry or be given in marriage. They will be as the angels of\nGod, members of the royal family.\nI would say to those who hold views contrary to this plain dec-\nlaration of Christ, Upon such matters silence is eloquence. It is\npresumption to indulge in suppositions and theories regarding mat-\nters that God has not made known to us in His Word. We need not\nenter into speculation regarding our future state.\nTo my ministering brethren I would say, \u201cPreach the word; be\ninstant in season, out of season\u201d (2 Timothy 4:2). Do not bring to\nthe foundation wood, and hay, and stubble\u2014your own surmisings\nand speculations, which can benefit no one.\nChrist withheld no truths essential to our salvation. Those things\nthat are revealed are for us and our children, but we are not to allow\nour imagination to frame doctrines concerning things not revealed.\nThe Lord has made every provision for our happiness in the\nfuture life, but He has made no revelations regarding these plans,\nand we are not to speculate concerning them. Neither are we to\n162 Selected Messages Book 1\nmeasure the conditions of the future life by the conditions of this\nlife.\nMatters of vital importance have been plainly revealed in the\nWord of God. These subjects are worthy of our deepest thought. But\nwe are not to search into matters on which God has been silent. Some\nhave put forth the speculation that the redeemed will not have gray\nhair. Other foolish suppositions have been put forward, as though\nthese were matters of importance. May God help His people to think\nrationally. When questions arise upon which we are uncertain, we\nshould ask, \u201cWhat saith the Scripture?\u201d\nLet those who wish for something new seek for that newness\nof life resulting from the new birth. Let them purify their souls by\nobeying the truth, and act in harmony with the instruction Christ\ngave to the lawyer who asked what he must do in order to inherit\neternal life.\n\u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with[174]\nall thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy\nneighbour as thyself.... This do, and thou shalt live\u201d (Luke 10:27,\n28). All who will conform their lives to the plain requirements of\nGod\u2019s Word will inherit eternal life.\u2014Manuscript 28, 1904.\nSubjects Difficult to Understand\nIn this work there is danger of bringing before the people theories\nwhich, while they may be all truth, will create controversy, and will\nnot lead men to the great supper prepared for them. We want the\nlove of God formed within to subdue and soften our human nature\nand to bring us into conformity to His holy character. Then we shall\nspread before the people the unsearchable riches of Christ in all their\nabundance. The invitation is given by Christ Himself, and it is the\nwork of all His followers to call attention to the board of provisions\nthat has been made accessible to all. Then let not subjects difficult\nto be understood come first. Christ is calling men to the banquet,\nand let all who will, come.\u2014Letter 89, 1898.\nThe One Hundred and Forty-four Thousand\nChrist says that there will be those in the church who will present\nfables and suppositions, when God has given grand, elevating, en-\nFanciful or Speculative Teachings 163\nnobling truths which should ever be kept in the treasure house of\nthe mind. When men pick up this theory and that theory, when they\nare curious to know something it is not necessary for them to know,\nGod is not leading them. It is not His plan that His people shall\npresent something which they have to suppose, which is not taught\nin the Word. It is not His will that they shall get into controversy\nover questions which will not help them spiritually, such as, Who is\nto compose the hundred and forty-four thousand? This those who\nare the elect of God will in a short time know without question.\nMy brethren and sisters, appreciate and study the truths God has\ngiven for you and your children. Spend not your time in seeking to [175]\nknow that which will be no spiritual help. \u201cWhat shall I do to inherit\neternal life?\u201d (Luke 10:25). This is the all-important question, and it\nhas been clearly answered. \u201cWhat is written in the law? how readest\nthou?\u201d\u2014Manuscript 26, 1901.\nChrist Calls for Unity\nOur church members see that there are differences of opinion\namong the leading men, and they themselves enter into controversy\nregarding the subjects under dispute. Christ calls for unity. But\nHe does not call for us to unify on wrong practices. The God of\nheaven draws a sharp contrast between pure, elevating, ennobling\ntruth and false, misleading doctrines. He calls sin and impenitence\nby the right name. He does not gloss over wrongdoing with a coat\nof untempered mortar. I urge our brethren to unify upon a true,\nscriptural basis.\u2014Manuscript 10, 1905.\nNo Strife for Supremacy\nWhen the laborers have an abiding Christ in their own souls,\nwhen all selfishness is dead, when there is no rivalry, no strife for\nthe supremacy, when oneness exists, when they sanctify themselves,\nso that love for one another is seen and felt, then the showers of\nthe grace of the Holy Spirit will just as surely come upon them as\nthat God\u2019s promise will never fail in one jot or tittle. But when\nthe work of others is discounted, that the workers may show their\nown superiority, they prove that their own work does not bear the\nsignature it should. God cannot bless them.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1896.\nChapter 22\u2014The Peril of Extreme Views[176]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Methods, No. 4.]\nSt. Helena, California\nMay 19, 1890\nDear Brother K,\nI expected ere this to see you and talk with you, or write to you;\nbut I have not been able to do either, neither am I now able; but I feel\na deep interest in you and am desirous that you shall not be separated\nfrom the work. I have not strength to do justice in conversation with\nyou; your mind is so quick and your tongue so fluent, that I fear\nI should become very much wearied, and that which I might say\nwould not remain distinct in your mind.\nI see your danger; you can readily put your thoughts into words.\nYou put things in a strong light; and your language is not guarded.\nYour views on some points are so expressed that you make your\nbrethren afraid of you. This need not be. You should not try to get\nas far from your brethren as you can, making it appear that you do\nnot see alike.\nI have been shown that your influence for good is greatly lessened\nbecause you feel it your duty to express your ideas on certain points[177]\nwhich you do not fully comprehend yourself, and which, with all\nyour efforts, you cannot make others comprehend. I have been\nshown that it was not necessary for you to feel that you must dwell\nupon these points. Some of your ideas are correct, others incorrect\nand erroneous.\nIf you would dwell on such subjects as Christ\u2019s willingness to\nforgive sins, to receive the sinner, to save that which is lost, subjects\nthat inspire hope and courage, you would be a blessing. But while\nyou strive to be original and take such extreme views, and use such\nstrong language in presenting them, there is danger of doing much\nharm. Some may grasp your thought and seem to be benefited, but\n164\nPeril of Extreme Views 165\nwhen tempted and overcome, they lose courage to fight the good\nfight of faith.\nIf you will dwell less on these ideas, which seem to you so impor-\ntant, and will restrain your extravagant expressions, you yourself will\nhave more faith. I saw that your mind was at times unbalanced from\ntrying very hard to study into and explain the mystery of godliness,\nwhich is just as great a mystery after your study and explanations as\nit was before.\nDiffering Experiences in Conversion\nLead the people to look to Jesus as their only hope and helper;\nleave the Lord room to work upon the mind, to speak to the soul,\nand to impress the understanding. It is not essential for you to know\nand tell others all the whys and wherefores as to what constitutes\nthe new heart, or as to the position they can and must reach so as\nnever to sin. You have no such work to do.\nAll are not constituted alike. Conversions are not all alike. Jesus\nimpresses the heart, and the sinner is born again to new life. Often\nsouls have been drawn to Christ when there was no violent convic-\ntion, no soul rending, no remorseful terrors. They looked upon an\nuplifted Saviour, they lived. They saw the soul\u2019s need, they saw the\nSaviour\u2019s sufficiency, and His claims, they heard His voice saying,\n\u201cFollow Me,\u201d and they rose up and followed Him. This conversion [178]\nwas genuine, and the religious life was just as decided as was that of\nothers who suffered all the agony of a violent process.\nOur ministers must cease to dwell upon their peculiar ideas with\nthe feeling, \u201cYou must see this point as I do, or you cannot be saved.\u201d\nAway with this egotism. The great work to be done in every case\nis to win souls to Christ. Men must see Jesus on the cross, they\nmust look and live. It is not your ideas they must feed upon, but\nit is the flesh and blood of the Son of God. He says, \u201cMy flesh is\nmeat indeed\u201d (John 6:55). \u201cThe words that I speak unto you, they\nare spirit, and they are life\u201d (John 6:63).\nLeave Christ Room to Work\nThe soul that accepts Jesus places himself under the care of the\nGreat Physician, and let men be careful how they come between\n166 Selected Messages Book 1\nthe patient and the Physician who discerns all the needs of the soul.\nChrist, the physician of the soul, understands its defects and its\nmaladies, and knows how to heal with the purchase of His own\nblood. What the soul lacks, He can best supply. But men are so\nofficious, they want to do so much, that they overdo the matter,\nleaving Christ no room to work.\nWhatever molding and fashioning needs to be wrought in the\nsoul, Christ can best do. The conviction may not be deep, but if the\nsinner comes to Christ, viewing Him upon the cross, the just dying\nfor the unjust, the sight will break every barrier down. Christ has\nundertaken the work of saving all who trust in Him for salvation.\nHe sees the wrongs that need to be righted, the evils that need to be\nrepressed. He came to seek and save that which was lost. \u201cHim that\ncometh to me,\u201d He says, \u201cI will in no wise cast out\u201d (John 6:37).\nThrough the goodness and mercy of Christ the sinner is to be\nrestored to the divine favor. God in Christ is daily beseeching men\nto be reconciled to God. With outstretched arms He is ready to\nreceive and welcome not only the sinner but the prodigal. His dying\nlove, manifested on Calvary, is the sinner\u2019s assurance of acceptance,\npeace, and love. Teach these things in the simplest form, that the sin-[179]\ndarkened soul may see the light shining from the cross of Calvary.\nSatan is working in many ways, that the very men who ought\nto preach the message may be occupied with fine-drawn theories\nwhich he will cause to appear of such magnitude and importance\nas to fill the whole mind; and while they think they are making\nwonderful strides in experience, they are idolizing a few ideas, and\ntheir influence is injured, and tells but little on the Lord\u2019s side.\nLet every minister make earnest efforts to ascertain what is the\nmind of Christ. Unless your mind becomes better balanced in regard\nto some things, your course will separate you from the work, and\nyou will not know at what you stumble. You will advance ideas\nwhich you might better never have originated.\nThere are those who pick out from the Word of God, and also\nfrom the Testimonies, detached paragraphs or sentences that may be\ninterpreted to suit their ideas, and they dwell upon these, and build\nthemselves up in their own positions, when God is not leading them.\nHere is your danger.\nPeril of Extreme Views 167\nYou will take passages in the Testimonies that speak of the close\nof probation, of the shaking among God\u2019s people, and you will talk\nof a coming out from this people of a purer, holier people that will\narise. Now all this pleases the enemy. We should not needlessly take\na course that will make differences or create dissension. We should\nnot give the impression that if our particular ideas are not followed,\nit is because the ministers are lacking in comprehension and in faith,\nand are walking in darkness.\nYour mind has been on an unnatural strain for a long time. You\nhave much truth, precious truth, but mingled with suppositions. Your\nextreme ideas and strong language often destroy the effect of your\nbest efforts. Should many accept the views you advance, and talk and\nact upon them, we would see one of the greatest fanatical excitements\nthat has ever been witnessed among Seventh-day Adventists. This is\nwhat Satan wants.\nLeave Mysteries Alone [180]\nNow there are in the lessons of Christ, subjects in abundance\nthat you can speak upon. And mysteries which neither you nor your\nhearers can understand or explain might better be left alone. Give the\nLord Jesus Christ room Himself to teach; let Him by the influence of\nHis Spirit open to the understanding the wonderful plan of salvation.\nThere is a time of trouble coming to the people of God, but we\nare not to keep that constantly before the people, and rein them\nup to have a time of trouble beforehand. There is to be a shaking\namong God\u2019s people, but this is not the present truth to carry to the\nchurches.. . .\nThe ministers should not feel that they have some wonderful\nadvanced ideas, and unless all receive these, they will be shaken\nout and a people will arise to go forward and upward to the victory.\nSome of those who are resisting the very principles of the message\nGod has sent for this time, present just such cases as yourself. They\npoint to your extreme views and teachings as an excuse for their\nneglect of receiving the Lord\u2019s messages.\nSatan\u2019s object is accomplished just as surely when men run ahead\nof Christ and do the work He has never entrusted to their hand, as\nwhen they remain in the Laodicean state, lukewarm, feeling rich and\n168 Selected Messages Book 1\nincreased with goods, and in need of nothing. The two classes are\nequally stumbling blocks.\nSome zealous ones who are aiming and straining every energy\nfor originality have made a grave mistake in trying to get something\nstartling, wonderful, entrancing before the people, something that\nthey think others do not comprehend; but they do not themselves\nknow what they are talking about. They speculate upon God\u2019s Word,\nadvancing ideas that are not a whit of help to themselves or to the\nchurches. For the time being they may excite the imagination, but\nthere is a reaction, and these very ideas become a hindrance. Faith\nis confounded with fancy, and their views may bias the mind in a\nwrong direction.\nLet the plain, simple statements of the Word of God be food for[181]\nthe mind; this speculating upon ideas that are not clearly presented\nthere is dangerous business.\nYou are naturally combative. You do not care much whether you\nharmonize with your brethren or not. You would like to enter into\ncontroversy, would like to fight for your particular ideas; but you\nshould lay this aside, for this is not developing the Christian graces.\nWork with all your power to answer the prayer of Christ, that His\ndisciples may be one, as He is one with the Father.\nNot a soul of us is safe unless we learn of Jesus daily, His\nmeekness, His lowliness of heart. When you go to any place to\nlabor, do not be dictatorial, do not be severe, do not be antagonistic.\nPreach the love of Christ, and this will melt and subdue hearts. Seek\nto be of one mind and of one judgment, coming close in harmony\nwith your brethren, and to speak the same things.\nTalk Not of Divisions\nThis talking about divisions because all do not have the same\nideas as present themselves to your mind, is not the work of God, but\nof the enemy. Talk the simple truths wherein you can agree. Talk of\nunity; do not become narrow and conceited; let your mind broaden.\nChrist does not weigh character in scales of human judgment.\nHe says, \u201cI, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto\nme\u201d (John 12:32). Every soul who responds to this drawing will turn\nfrom iniquity. Christ is able to save to the uttermost all who come\nPeril of Extreme Views 169\nunto Him. He who comes to Jesus is setting his feet upon a ladder\nthat reaches from earth to heaven. Teach it by pen, by voice, that\nGod is above the ladder; the bright rays of His glory are shining upon\nevery round of the ladder. He is looking graciously upon all who\nare climbing painfully upward, that He may send them help, divine\nhelp, when the hand seems to be relaxing and the foot trembling.\nYes, tell it, tell it in words that will melt the heart, that not one who\nshall perseveringly climb the ladder will fail of an entrance into the\neverlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; those [182]\nwho believe in Christ shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them\nout of His hand.\nTell the people in clear, hopeful language how they may escape\nthe heritage of shame which is our deserved portion. But for Christ\u2019s\nsake do not present before them ideas that will discourage them,\nthat will make the way to heaven seem very difficult. Keep all these\noverstrained ideas to yourself.\nWhile we must often impress the mind with the fact that the\nChristian life is a life of warfare, that we must watch and pray and\ntoil, that there is peril to the soul in relaxing the spiritual vigilance\nfor one moment, the completeness of the salvation proffered us from\nJesus who loves us and gave Himself that we should not perish but\nhave everlasting life, is to be the theme.\nDay by day we may walk with God, day by day following on\nto know the Lord, entering into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,\nlaying hold on the hope set before us. If we reach heaven it must\nbe by binding the soul to the Mediator, becoming partakers of the\ndivine nature. Leaning on Christ, your life being hid with Christ in\nGod and led by His Spirit, you have the genuine faith.\nBelieving fully in the efficacy of His atoning sacrifice, we shall\nbe laborers together with God. Trusting in His merits, we are to\nwork out our own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God that\nworketh in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure. Always\nkeeping hold of Christ, we are coming nearer and nearer to God.\nJesus desires us to keep this always prominent. Do not arouse your\ncombative spirit; the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then\npeaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits....\n170 Selected Messages Book 1\nHarmonize With Your Brethren\nDo not think that you must make prominent every idea your\nimagination receives. Jesus said to His disciples, \u201cI have yet many\nthings to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\u201d (John 16:12).\nHow much more should we, who are constantly liable to err, beware\nof urging upon others that which they are not prepared to receive.[183]\nConstantly looking unto Jesus, restrain your strong, extravagant\nexpressions. But while you should be cautious as to your words and\nideas, it is not necessary that your labors should entirely cease. Seek\nto be in harmony with your brethren, and there will be plenty for you\nto do in the vineyard of the Lord. But exalt Christ, not your ideas\nand views. Put on the armor, and keep step with God\u2019s workers,\nshoulder to shoulder; press the battle against the enemy. Hide in\nJesus. Dwell on the simple lessons of Christ, feed the flock of God,\nand you will become settled, strengthened, established; you will\nwork to build up others in the most holy faith.\nIf you differ with your brethren as to your understanding of the\ngrace of Christ and the operations of His Spirit, you should not make\nthese differences prominent. You view the matter from one point; an-\nother, just as devoted to God, views the same question from another\npoint, and speaks of the things that make the deepest impression\non his mind; another viewing it from a still different point, presents\nanother phase; and how foolish it is to get into contention over these\nthings, when there is really nothing to contend about. Let God work\non the mind and impress the heart.\nThe Lord is constantly at work to open the understanding, to\nquicken the perceptions, that man may have a right sense of sin and\nof the far-reaching claims of God\u2019s law. The unconverted man thinks\nof God as unloving, as severe, and even revengeful; His presence\nis thought to be a constant restraint, His character an expression of\n\u201cThou shalt not.\u201d His service is regarded as full of gloom and hard\nrequirements. But when Jesus is seen upon the cross, as the gift\nof God because He loved man, the eyes are opened to see things\nin a new light. God as revealed in Christ is not a severe judge, an\navenging tyrant, but a merciful and loving Father.\nAs we see Jesus dying upon the cross to save lost man, the heart\nechoes the words of John, \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father\nPeril of Extreme Views 171\nhath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: [184]\ntherefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not\u201d (1\nJohn 3:1). There is nothing that more decidedly distinguishes the\nChristian from the worldly man than the estimate he has of God.\nSome workers in the cause of God have been too ready to hurl\ndenunciations against the sinner; the grace and love of the Father\nin giving His Son to die for the sinful race have been put in the\nbackground. The teacher needs the grace of Christ upon his own\nsoul, in order to make known to the sinner what God really is\u2014a\nFather waiting with yearning love to receive the returning prodigal,\nnot hurling at him accusations in wrath, but preparing a festival of\njoy to welcome his return (Zephaniah 3:14-17).\nO that we might all learn the way of the Lord in winning souls to\nChrist! We should learn and teach the precious lessons in the light\nthat shineth from the sacrifice upon the cross of Calvary. There is\nbut one way that leads from ruin, and continuously ascends, faith all\nthe time reaching beyond the darkness into the light, until it rests\nupon the throne of God. All who have learned this lesson have\naccepted the light which has come to their understanding. To them\nthis upward way is not a dark, uncertain passage; it is not the way\nof finite minds, not a path cut out by human device, a path in which\ntoll is exacted from every traveler.\nYou cannot gain an entrance by penance nor by any works that\nyou can do. No, God Himself has the honor of providing a way, and\nit is so complete, so perfect, that man cannot, by any works he may\ndo, add to its perfection. It is broad enough to receive the greatest\nsinner if he repents, and it is so narrow, so holy, lifted up so high,\nthat sin cannot be admitted there.\nWhen God is seen as He is, the blessed truth shines with a\nnew and clearer light. That which kept the mind in perplexity is\ncleared away by the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. And\nyet there are many things we shall not comprehend; but we have\nthe blessed assurance that what we know not now, we shall know\nhereafter.\u2014Letter 15a, 1890.\nChapter 23\u2014Beware of Any Time Setting[185]\n\u201cIt is not for you to Know the Times or the Seasons\u201d\n[Sermon at Lansing, Michigan, September 5, 1891.]\n\u201cHe shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible\nproofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things per-\ntaining to the kingdom of God: and, being assembled together with\nthem, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem,\nbut wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard\nof me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized\nwith the Holy Ghost not many days hence. When they therefore\nwere come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at\nthis time restore again the kingdom to Israel? And he said unto them,\nIt is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father\nhath put in his own power\u201d (Acts 1:3-7).\nThe disciples were anxious to know the exact time for the rev-\nelation of the kingdom of God; but Jesus tells them that they may\nnot know the times and the seasons; for the Father has not revealed\nthem. To understand when the kingdom of God should be restored,\nwas not the thing of most importance for them to know. They were [186]\nto be found following the Master, praying, waiting, watching, and\nworking. They were to be representatives to the world of the char-\nacter of Christ. That which was essential for a successful Christian\nexperience in the days of the disciples, is essential in our day. \u201cAnd\nhe said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons,\nwhich the Father hath put in his own power. But ye shall receive\npower, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you.\u201d And after the\nHoly Ghost was come upon them, what were they to do? \u201cAnd ye\nshall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and\nin Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:7, 8).\n172\nBeware of Any Time Setting 173\nImprove Present Opportunities\nThis is the work in which we also are to be engaged. Instead\nof living in expectation of some special season of excitement, we\nare wisely to improve present opportunities, doing that which must\nbe done in order that souls may be saved. Instead of exhausting\nthe powers of our mind in speculations in regard to the times and\nseasons which the Lord has placed in His own power, and withheld\nfrom men, we are to yield ourselves to the control of the Holy Spirit,\nto do present duties, to give the bread of life, unadulterated with\nhuman opinions, to souls who are perishing for the truth.\nSatan is ever ready to fill the mind with theories and calculations\nthat will divert men from the present truth, and disqualify them for\nthe giving of the third angel\u2019s message to the world. It has ever been\nthus; for our Saviour often had to speak reprovingly to those who\nindulged in speculations and were ever inquiring into those things\nwhich the Lord had not revealed. Jesus had come to earth to impart\nimportant truth to men, and He wished to impress their minds with\nthe necessity of receiving and obeying His precepts and instructions,\nof doing their present duty, and His communications were of an\norder that imparted knowledge for their immediate and daily use.\nJesus said: \u201cThis is life eternal, that they might know thee the [187]\nonly true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (John 17:3).\nAll that was done and said had this one object in view\u2014to rivet truth\nin their minds that they might attain unto everlasting life. Jesus did\nnot come to astonish men with some great announcement of some\nspecial time when some great event would occur, but He came to\ninstruct and save the lost. He did not come to arouse and gratify\ncuriosity; for He knew that this would but increase the appetite for\nthe curious and the marvelous. It was His aim to impart knowledge\nwhereby men might increase in spiritual strength, and advance in the\nway of obedience and true holiness. He gave only such instruction\nas could be appropriated to the needs of their daily life, only such\ntruth as could be given to others for the same appropriation.\nHe did not make new revelations to men, but opened to their un-\nderstanding truths that had long been obscured or misplaced through\nthe false teaching of the priests and teachers. Jesus replaced the\ngems of divine truth in their proper setting, in the order in which\n174 Selected Messages Book 1\nthey had been given to patriarchs and prophets. And after giving\nthem this precious instruction, He promised to give them the Holy\nSpirit whereby all things that He had said unto them should be\nbrought to their remembrance.\nWe are in continual danger of getting above the simplicity of the\ngospel. There is an intense desire on the part of many to startle the\nworld with something original, that shall lift the people into a state of\nspiritual ecstasy, and change the present order of experience. There\nis certainly great need of a change in the present order of experience;\nfor the sacredness of present truth is not realized as it should be, but\nthe change we need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained\nby seeking God individually for His blessing, by pleading with Him\nfor His power, by fervently praying that His grace may come upon\nus, and that our characters may be transformed. This is the change\nwe need today, and for the attainment of this experience we should\nexercise persevering energy and manifest heartfelt earnestness. We\nshould ask with true sincerity, \u201cWhat shall I do to be saved?\u201d We[188]\nshould know just what steps we are taking heavenward.\nWarned in Regard to Time Setting\nChrist gave to His disciples truths whose breadth and depth and\nvalue they little appreciated, or even comprehended, and the same\ncondition exists among the people of God today. We too have failed\nto take in the greatness, to perceive the beauty of the truth which God\nhas entrusted to us today. Should we advance in spiritual knowledge,\nwe would see the truth developing and expanding in lines of which\nwe have little dreamed, but it will never develop in any line that\nwill lead us to imagine that we may know the times and the seasons\nwhich the Father hath put in His own power. Again and again have I\nbeen warned in regard to time setting. There will never again be a\nmessage for the people of God that will be based on time. We are\nnot to know the definite time either for the outpouring of the Holy\nSpirit or for the coming of Christ.\nI was searching through my writings, before coming to this\nmeeting, to see what I should take with me to Australia, and I found\nan envelope on which was written, \u201cTestimony given in regard to\nBeware of Any Time Setting 175\ntime setting, June 21, 1851. Preserve carefully.\u201d I opened it, and this\nis what I found. It reads:\n\u201cA copy of a vision the Lord gave Sister White, June 21, 1851,\nat Camden, N.Y . The Lord showed me that the message must go,\nand that it must not be hung on time; for time will never be a test\nagain. I saw that some were getting a false excitement, arising from\npreaching time, that the third angel\u2019s message can stand on its own\nfoundation, and that it needs not time to strengthen it, and that it\nwill go with mighty power, and do its work, and will be cut short in\nrighteousness.\n\u201cI saw some were making everything bend to this next fall; that\nis, making their calculations, and disposing of their property in\nreference to that time. I saw that this was wrong for this reason:\ninstead of going to God daily, and earnestly desiring to know their\npresent duty, they looked ahead, and made their calculations as [189]\nthough they knew that the work would end this fall, without inquiring\ntheir duty of God daily.\nE. G. White.\n\u201cCopied at Milton, June 29, 1851, A. A. G.\u201d\nThis was the document I came upon last Monday in searching\nover my writings, and here is another which was written in regard\nto a man who was setting time in 1884, and sending broadcast his\narguments to prove his theories. The report of what he was doing\nwas brought to me at the Jackson [Michigan] camp meeting, and I\ntold the people they need not take heed to this man\u2019s theory; for the\nevent he predicted would not take place. The times and the seasons\nGod has put in His own power. And why has not God given us this\nknowledge?\u2014Because we would not make a right use of it if He\ndid. A condition of things would result from this knowledge among\nour people that would greatly retard the work of God in preparing a\npeople to stand in the great day that is to come. We are not to live\nupon time excitement. We are not to be engrossed with speculations\nin regard to the times and the seasons which God has not revealed.\nJesus has told His disciples to \u201cwatch,\u201d but not for a definite time.\nHis followers are to be in the position of those who are listening for\nthe orders of their Captain; they are to watch, wait, pray, and work,\n176 Selected Messages Book 1\nas they approach the time for the coming of the Lord; but no one\nwill be able to predict just when that time will come; for \u201cof that\nday and hour knoweth no man.\u201d You will not be able to say that He\nwill come in one, two, or five years, neither are you to put off His\ncoming by stating that it may not be for ten or twenty years.\nTo Have Lamps Trimmed and Burning\nIt is the duty of the people of God to have their lamps trimmed\nand burning, to be as men that wait for the Bridegroom, when He\nshall return from the wedding. You have not a moment to lose in\nneglect of the great salvation that has been provided for you. The\ntime of the probation of souls is coming to an end. From day to day\nthe destiny of men is being sealed, and even from this congregation[190]\nwe know not how soon many shall close their eyes in death and be\nhabited for the tomb. We should now consider that our life is swiftly\npassing away, that we are not safe one moment unless our life is\nhid with Christ in God. Our duty is not to be looking forward to\nsome special time for some special work to be done for us, but to go\nforward in our work of warning the world; for we are to be witnesses\nof Christ to the uttermost parts of the world.\nAll around us are the young, the impenitent, the unconverted,\nand what are we doing for them? Parents, in the ardor of your first\nlove, are you seeking for the conversion of your children, or are you\nengrossed with the things of this life to such an extent that you are\nnot making earnest efforts to be laborers together with God? Do you\nhave an appreciation of the work and mission of the Holy Spirit?\nDo you realize that the Holy Spirit is the agency whereby we are to\nreach the souls of those around us? When this meeting shall close,\nwill you go from here and forget the earnest appeals that have been\nmade to you? Will the messages of warning be left unheeded, and\nthe truth you have heard leak out of your heart as water leaks out of\na broken vessel?\nThe apostle says, \u201cTherefore we ought to give the more earnest\nheed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should\nlet them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and\nevery transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of\nreward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\nBeware of Any Time Setting 177\nat the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto\nus by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both\nwith signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the\nHoly Ghost, according to his own will?\u201d (Hebrews 2:1-4).\nThe third angel\u2019s message is swelling into a loud cry, and you\nmust not feel at liberty to neglect the present duty, and still entertain\nthe idea that at some future time you will be the recipients of great\nblessing, when without any effort on your part a wonderful revival\nwill take place. Today you are to give yourselves to God, that He may [191]\nmake of you vessels unto honor, and meet for His service. Today\nyou are to give yourself to God, that you may be emptied of self,\nemptied of envy, jealousy, evil surmising, strife, everything that shall\nbe dishonoring to God. Today you are to have your vessel purified\nthat it may be ready for the heavenly dew, ready for the showers\nof the latter rain; for the latter rain will come, and the blessing of\nGod will fill every soul that is purified from every defilement. It is\nour work today to yield our souls to Christ, that we may be fitted\nfor the time of refreshing from the presence of the Lord\u2014fitted for\nthe baptism of the Holy Spirit.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 22,\n1892.\nThe Time Not Revealed\nGod has not revealed to us the time when this message will close,\nor when probation will have an end. Those things that are revealed\nwe shall accept for ourselves and for our children; but let us not\nseek to know that which has been kept secret in the councils of the\nAlmighty. It is our duty to watch and work and wait, to labor every\nmoment for the souls of men that are ready to perish. We are to keep\nwalking continually in the footsteps of Jesus, working in His lines,\ndispensing His gifts as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.\nSatan will be ready to give to anyone who is not learning every day\nof Jesus, a special message of his own creating, in order to make of\nno effect the wonderful truth for this time.\nLetters have come to me asking me if I have any special light\nas to the time when probation will close; and I answer that I have\nonly this message to bear, that it is now time to work while the day\nlasts, for the night cometh in which no man can work. Now, just\n178 Selected Messages Book 1\nnow, it is time for us to be watching, working, and waiting. The\nWord of the Lord reveals the fact that the end of all things is at hand,\nand its testimony is most decided that it is necessary for every soul\nto have the truth planted in the heart so that it will control the life\nand sanctify the character. The Spirit of the Lord is working to take[192]\nthe truth of the inspired Word and stamp it upon the soul so that\nprofessed followers of Christ will have a holy, sacred joy that they\nwill be able to impart to others. The opportune time for us to work\nis now, just now, while the day lasts. But there is no command for\nanyone to search the Scripture in order to ascertain, if possible, when\nprobation will close. God has no such message for any mortal lips.\nHe would have no mortal tongue declare that which He has hidden\nin His secret councils.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 9, 1894.\nWatch and Pray\nI have no specific time of which to speak when the outpouring of\nthe Holy Spirit will take place\u2014when the mighty angel will come\ndown from heaven, and unite with the third angel in closing up the\nwork for this world; my message is that our only safety is in being\nready for the heavenly refreshing, having our lamps trimmed and\nburning. Christ has told us to watch; \u201cfor in such an hour as ye\nthink not, the Son of man cometh.\u201d \u201cWatch and pray\u201d is the charge\nthat is given us by our Redeemer. Day by day we are to seek the\nenlightenment of the Spirit of God, that it may do its office work\nupon the soul and character.

Satan and his angels are working with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness. They are untiring in their efforts\nto draw souls away from the truth, away from righteousness, to\nspread ruin throughout the universe. They work with marvelous\nindustry to furnish a multitude of deceptions to take souls captive.\nTheir efforts are unceasing. The enemy is ever seeking to lead souls\ninto infidelity and skepticism. He would do away with God, and\nwith Christ, who was made flesh and dwelt among us to teach us\nthat in obedience to God\u2019s will we may be victorious over sin.\nAssailed by Every Form of Evil\nEvery form of evil is waiting for an opportunity to assail us.\nFlattery, bribes, inducements, promises of wonderful exaltation, will\nbe most assiduously employed.\nWhat are God\u2019s servants doing to raise the barrier of a \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord\u201d against this evil?

For in\nhim dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily\u201d (Colossians\n2:4-9).\nWill the men in our institutions keep silent, allowing insidious\nfallacies to be promulgated to the ruin of souls? The sentiments\nof the enemy are being scattered everywhere. Seeds of discord, of\nunbelief, of infidelity, are being sown broadcast. Shall our medical\nmissionaries raise no barrier against this evil? Is it not time that we\nasked ourselves, Shall we allow the adversary to lead us to give up\nthe work of proclaiming the truth? Shall we allow him to keep us\nfrom being channels through which the blessings of the gospel, as a\ncurrent of life, shall flow to the world? Let every man now arouse,\nand work as he has opportunity. Let him speak words in season and\nout of season, and look to Christ for encouragement and strength in\nwelldoing.\nDangers Continually Increasing\nThe dangers coming upon us are continually increasing. It is high\ntime that we put on the whole armor of God, and work earnestly to\nkeep Satan from gaining any further advantage. Angels of God, that [196]\nexcel in strength, are waiting for us to call them to our aid, that our\nfaith may not be eclipsed by the fierceness of the conflict. Renewed\nenergy is now needed. Vigilant action is called for. Indifference and\nsloth will result in the loss of personal religion and of heaven.\nAt this time the Laodicean message is to be given, to arouse a\nslumbering church.

[Reference is here made to Dr. J. H. Kellogg, for many years\nthe medical superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium.\u2014Com-\npilers.] O that they had broken the yoke! O that they had called sin\nby its right name! Then they would not be regarded in the heavenly\ncourts as men who, though bearing weighty responsibilities, have\nfailed of speaking the truth in reproof of that which has been in\ndisobedience to God\u2019s Word.\nPhysicians, have you been doing the Master\u2019s business in lis-\ntening to fanciful and spiritualistic interpretations of the Scriptures,\ninterpretations which undermine the foundations of our faith, and\nholding your peace? God says, \u201cNeither will I be with you any more,\nunless you awake, and vindicate your Redeemer.\u201d\nSophistries That Undermine the Pillars\nMy message to you is: No longer consent to listen without\nprotest to the perversion of truth. Unmask the pretentious sophistries\nwhich, if received, will lead ministers and physicians and medical\nmissionary workers to ignore the truth. Every one is now to stand\non his guard. God calls upon men and women to take their stand\nunder the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel. I have been\ninstructed to warn our people; for many are in danger of receiving[197]\ntheories and sophistries that undermine the foundation pillars of the\nfaith.\nSometimes our physicians talk for hours, when they are weary\nand perplexed, and in no fit condition to talk. Medical missionaries\nshould refuse to hold long night sessions of conversation. These\nnight talks have been times when Satan with his seductive influence\nhas stolen away from one and then another the faith once delivered\nto the saints. Brilliant, sparkling ideas often flash from a mind that\nis influenced by the great deceiver. Those who listen and acquiesce\nwill become charmed, as Eve was charmed by the serpent\u2019s words.\nThey cannot listen to charming philosophical speculations, and at\nthe same time keep the word of the living God clearly in mind.\nOur physicians have lost a great deal out of their lives because\nthey have seen wrong transactions and heard wrong words spoken,\nAlpha and the Omega 183\nand seen wrong principles followed, and have not spoken in reproof,\nfor fear that they would be repulsed.\nI call upon those who have been connected with these binding\ninfluences to break the yoke to which they have long submitted, and\nstand as free men in Christ. Nothing but a determined effort will\nbreak the spell that is upon them.\nThe Alpha Now Seen\nBe not deceived; many will depart from the faith, giving heed to\nseducing spirits and doctrines of devils. We have now before us the\nalpha of this danger. The omega will be of a most startling nature.\nWe need to study the words that Christ uttered in the prayer that\nHe offered just before His trial and crucifixion. \u201cThese words spake\nJesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is\ncome; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee: as thou\nhast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life\nto as many as thou hast given him. And this is life eternal, that they\nmight know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou\nhast sent. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work [198]\nwhich thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me\nwith thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the\nworld was. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou\ngavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them\nme; and they have kept thy word\u201d (John 17:1-6).\nChristians to Manifest Godliness\nThe righteousness of God is absolute. This righteousness char-\nacterizes all His works, all His laws. As God is, so must His people\nbe. The life of Christ is to be revealed in the lives of His followers.\nIn all His public and private acts, in every word and deed, practical\ngodliness was seen, and this godliness is to be seen in the lives of\nHis disciples.\nThose who heed the light given them will bring the virtues of the\ncharacter of Christ into the daily life. Christ did no sin, because there\nwas no sin in Him. God has shown me that the lives of believers are\nto reveal practical righteousness.\n184 Selected Messages Book 1\nHas not God spoken in His Word concerning the solemn events\nwhich must shortly take place? As you read these things, do you\nbelieve what He says? Or have you, through listening to specious\nphilosophy, given up your faith in God? Can any power avert the\npunishment that must come upon you unless you humble your hearts\nbefore God and confess your sins? How is it, my brethren in the\nmedical missionary work? Does not the living God speak to you\nfrom His Word concerning the events that are taking place in fulfill-\nment of that Word? Soon the last great reckoning with man will take\nplace. Have your lives been such that you can then be weighed in the\nbalances of the sanctuary, and not be found wanting? Or has your\nfaith been molded and restricted until it has become unbelief?

There are in it sentiments that are entirely true,\nbut these are mingled with error. Scriptures are taken out of their\nconnection, and are used to uphold erroneous theories.\nThe thought of the errors contained in this book has given me\ngreat distress, and the experience that I have passed through in\nconnection with the matter has nearly cost me my life.\nIt will be said that Living Temple has been revised. But the Lord\nhas shown me that the writer has not changed, and that there can\nbe no unity between him and the ministers of the gospel while he\ncontinues to cherish his present sentiments. I am bidden to lift my\nvoice in warning to our people, saying, \u201cBe not deceived; God is not\nmocked\u201d (Galatians 6:7).\nAlpha and the Omega 185\nYou have had access toTestimonies for the Church, volumes 7\nand 8. In these Testimonies the danger signal is raised. But the light\nso clear and plain to minds that have not been influenced by deceptive\ntheories, has not been discerned by some.

There should be no union until there is a change.\nWhen medical missionaries make their practice and example\nharmonize with the name they bear, when they feel their need of\nuniting firmly with the ministers of the gospel, then there can be\nharmonious action.

He who\ndeclared that His truth would shine forever will proclaim this truth\nthrough faithful messengers, who will give the trumpet a certain\nsound. The truth will be criticized, scorned, and derided; but the\ncloser it is examined and tested, the brighter it will shine.\nAs a people, we are to stand firm on the platform of eternal truth\nthat has withstood test and trial. We are to hold to the sure pillars of\nour faith. The principles of truth that God has revealed to us are our\nonly true foundation. They have made us what we are. The lapse\nof time has not lessened their value. It is the constant effort of the\nenemy to remove these truths from their setting, and to put in their\nplace spurious theories. He will bring in everything that he possibly\ncan to carry out his deceptive designs. But the Lord will raise up\nmen of keen perception, who will give these truths their proper place\nin the plan of God.\nI have been instructed by the heavenly messenger that some\nof the reasoning in the book Living Temple is unsound, and that[202]\nthis reasoning would lead astray the minds of those who are not\nthoroughly established on the foundation principles of present truth.\nIt introduces that which is nought but speculation in regard to the\npersonality of God and where His presence is. No one on this earth\nhas a right to speculate on this question. The more fanciful theories\nare discussed, the less men will know of God and of the truth that\nsanctifies the soul.\nOne and another come to me, asking me to explain the positions\ntaken in Living Temple. I reply, \u201cThey are unexplainable.\u201d The sen-\ntiments expressed do not give a true knowledge of God. All through\nthe book are passages of Scripture. These scriptures are brought\n186\nFoundation of Our Faith 187\nin in such a way that error is made to appear as truth. Erroneous\ntheories are presented in so pleasing a way that unless care is taken,\nmany will be misled.\nWe need not the mysticism that is in this book. Those who\nentertain these sophistries will soon find themselves in a position\nwhere the enemy can talk with them, and lead them away from God.\nIt is represented to me that the writer of this book is on a false track.\nHe has lost sight of the distinguishing truths for this time. He knows\nnot whither his steps are tending. The track of truth lies close beside\nthe track of error, and both tracks may seem to be one to minds\nwhich are not worked by the Holy Spirit, and which, therefore, are\nnot quick to discern the difference between truth and error.\nA View of Approaching Danger\nAbout the time that Living Temple was published, there passed\nbefore me in the night season, representations indicating that some\ndanger was approaching, and that I must prepare for it by writing\nout the things God had revealed to me regarding the foundation\nprinciples of our faith. A copy of Living Temple was sent me, but\nit remained in my library, unread. From the light given me by the\nLord, I knew that some of the sentiments advocated in the book did\nnot bear the endorsement of God, and that they were a snare that\nthe enemy had prepared for the last days. I thought that this would [203]\nsurely be discerned, and that it would not be necessary for me to say\nanything about it.\nIn the controversy that arose among our brethren regarding the\nteachings of this book, those in favor of giving it a wide circulation\ndeclared: \u201cIt contains the very sentiments that Sister White has been\nteaching.\u201d This assertion struck right to my heart. I felt heartbroken;\nfor I knew that this representation of the matter was not true.\nFinally my son said to me, \u201cMother, you ought to read at least\nsome parts of the book, that you may see whether they are in har-\nmony with the light that God has given you.\u201d He sat down beside\nme, and together we read the preface, and most of the first chapter,\nand also paragraphs in other chapters. As we read, I recognized\nthe very sentiments against which I had been bidden to speak in\nwarning during the early days of my public labors. When I first left\n188 Selected Messages Book 1\nthe State of Maine, it was to go through Vermont and Massachusetts,\nto bear a testimony against these sentiments. Living Temple contains\nthe alpha of these theories. I knew that the omega would follow\nin a little while; and I trembled for our people. I knew that I must\nwarn our brethren and sisters not to enter into controversy over the\npresence and personality of God. The statements made in Living\nTemple in regard to this point are incorrect. The scripture used to\nsubstantiate the doctrine there set forth, is scripture misapplied.\nI am compelled to speak in denial of the claim that the teachings\nof Living Temple can be sustained by statements from my writings.\nThere may be in this book expressions and sentiments that are in\nharmony with my writings. And there may be in my writings many\nstatements which, taken from their connection, and interpreted ac-\ncording to the mind of the writer ofLiving Temple, would seem to be\nin harmony with the teachings of this book. This may give apparent\nsupport to the assertion that the sentiments in Living Temple are\nin harmony with my writings. But God forbid that this sentiment\nshould prevail.\nFew can discern the result of entertaining the sophistries\nadvocated by some at this time. But the Lord has lifted the curtain,[204]\nand has shown me the result that would follow. The spiritualistic\ntheories regarding the personality of God, followed to their logical\nconclusion, sweep away the whole Christian economy. They esti-\nmate as nothing the light that Christ came from heaven to give John\nto give to His people. They teach that the scenes just before us are\nnot of sufficient importance to be given special attention. They make\nof no effect the truth of heavenly origin, and rob the people of God\nof their past experience, giving them instead a false science.\nIn a vision of the night I was shown distinctly that these senti-\nments have been looked upon by some as the grand truths that are to\nbe brought in and made prominent at the present time. I was shown\na platform, braced by solid timbers\u2014the truths of the Word of God.\nSomeone high in responsibility in the medical work was directing\nthis man and that man to loosen the timbers supporting this platform.\nThen I heard a voice saying, \u201cWhere are the watchmen that ought to\nbe standing on the walls of Zion? Are they asleep? This foundation\nwas built by the Master Worker, and will stand storm and tempest.\nWill they permit this man to present doctrines that deny the past\nFoundation of Our Faith 189\nexperience of the people of God? The time has come to take decided\naction.\u201d\nThe enemy of souls has sought to bring in the supposition that a\ngreat reformation was to take place among Seventh-day Adventists,\nand that this reformation would consist in giving up the doctrines\nwhich stand as the pillars of our faith, and engaging in a process\nof reorganization. Were this reformation to take place, what would\nresult? The principles of truth that God in His wisdom has given\nto the remnant church, would be discarded. Our religion would\nbe changed. The fundamental principles that have sustained the\nwork for the last fifty years would be accounted as error. A new\norganization would be established. Books of a new order would be\nwritten. A system of intellectual philosophy would be introduced.\nThe founders of this system would go into the cities, and do a\nwonderful work. The Sabbath of course, would be lightly regarded, [205]\nas also the God who created it. Nothing would be allowed to stand in\nthe way of the new movement. The leaders would teach that virtue\nis better than vice, but God being removed, they would place their\ndependence on human power, which, without God, is worthless.\nTheir foundation would be built on the sand, and storm and tempest\nwould sweep away the structure.\nWho has authority to begin such a movement? We have our\nBibles. We have our experience, attested to by the miraculous work-\ning of the Holy Spirit. We have a truth that admits of no compromise.\nShall we not repudiate everything that is not in harmony with this\ntruth?\nI hesitated and delayed about the sending out of that which the\nSpirit of the Lord impelled me to write. I did not want to be com-\npelled to present the misleading influence of these sophistries. But\nin the providence of God, the errors that have been coming in must\nbe met.\nAn Iceberg! \u201cMeet It\u201d\nShortly before I sent out the testimonies regarding the efforts\nof the enemy to undermine the foundation of our faith through the\ndissemination of seductive theories, I had read an incident about\na ship in a fog meeting an iceberg. For several nights I slept but\n190 Selected Messages Book 1\nlittle. I seemed to be bowed down as a cart beneath sheaves. One\nnight a scene was clearly presented before me. A vessel was upon\nthe waters, in a heavy fog. Suddenly the lookout cried, \u201cIceberg\njust ahead!\u201d There, towering high above the ship, was a gigantic\niceberg. An authoritative voice cried out, \u201cMeet it!\u201d There was not a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation. It was a time for instant action. The engineer\nput on full steam, and the man at the wheel steered the ship straight\ninto the iceberg. With a crash she struck the ice. There was a fearful\nshock, and the iceberg broke into many pieces, falling with a noise\nlike thunder to the deck. The passengers were violently shaken by\nthe force of the collisions, but no lives were lost. The vessel was\ninjured, but not beyond repair. She rebounded from the contact,\ntrembling from stem to stern, like a living creature. Then she moved[206]\nforward on her way.\nWell I knew the meaning of this representation. I had my orders.\nI had heard the words, like a voice from our Captain, \u201cMeet it!\u201d I\nknew what my duty was, and that there was not a moment to lose.\nThe time for decided action had come. I must without delay obey\nthe command, \u201cMeet it!\u201d\nThat night I was up at one o\u2019clock, writing as fast as my hand\ncould pass over the paper. For the next few days I worked early and\nlate, preparing for our people the instruction given me regarding the\nerrors that were coming in among us.\nI have been hoping that there would be a thorough reformation,\nand that the principles for which we fought in the early days, and\nwhich were brought out in the power of the Holy Spirit, would be\nmaintained.\nThe Firm Foundation of Our Faith\nMany of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation\nof our faith has been laid. My husband, Elder Joseph Bates, Father\nPierce, [Older brethren among the pioneers are here thus reminis-\ncently referred to. \u201cFather Pierce\u201d was Stephen Pierce, who served\nin ministerial and administrative work in the early days. \u201cFather\nAndrews\u201d was Edward Andrews, the father of J. N. Andrews.\u2014\nCompilers.] Elder [Hiram] Edson, and others who were keen, noble,\nand true, were among those who, after the passing of the time in\nFoundation of Our Faith 191\n1844, searched for the truth as for hidden treasure. I met with them,\nand we studied and prayed earnestly. Often we remained together\nuntil late at night, and sometimes through the entire night, praying\nfor light and studying the Word. Again and again these brethren\ncame together to study the Bible, in order that they might know its\nmeaning, and be prepared to teach it with power. When they came to\nthe point in their study where they said, \u201cWe can do nothing more,\u201d\nthe Spirit of the Lord would come upon me, I would be taken off in\nvision, and a clear explanation of the passages we had been studying [207]\nwould be given me, with instruction as to how we were to labor and\nteach effectively. Thus light was given that helped us to understand\nthe scriptures in regard to Christ, His mission, and His priesthood.\nA line of truth extending from that time to the time when we shall\nenter the city of God, was made plain to me, and I gave to others the\ninstruction that the Lord had given me.\nDuring this whole time I could not understand the reasoning\nof the brethren. My mind was locked, as it were, and I could not\ncomprehend the meaning of the scriptures we were studying. This\nwas one of the greatest sorrows of my life. I was in this condition\nof mind until all the principal points of our faith were made clear to\nour minds, in harmony with the Word of God. The brethren knew\nthat when not in vision, I could not understand these matters, and\nthey accepted as light direct from heaven the revelations given.\nFor two or three years my mind continued to be locked to an\nunderstanding of the Scriptures. In the course of our labors, my\nhusband and I visited Father Andrews, [See note on page 206.] who\nwas suffering intensely with inflammatory rheumatism. We prayed\nfor him. I laid my hands on his head, and said, \u201cFather Andrews, the\nLord Jesus maketh thee whole.\u201d He was healed instantly. He got up,\nand walked about the room, praising God, and saying, \u201cI never saw\nit on this wise before. Angels of God are in this room.\u201d The glory of\nthe Lord was revealed. Light seemed to shine all through the house,\nand an angel\u2019s hand was laid upon my head. From that time to this I\nhave been able to understand the Word of God.\nWhat influence is it would lead men at this stage of our history\nto work in an underhand, powerful way to tear down the foundation\nof our faith\u2014the foundation that was laid at the beginning of our\nwork by prayerful study of the Word and by revelation? Upon this\n192 Selected Messages Book 1\nfoundation we have been building for the past fifty years. Do you\nwonder that when I see the beginning of a work that would remove [208]\nsome of the pillars of our faith, I have something to say? I must obey\nthe command, \u201cMeet it!\u201d...\nI must bear the messages of warning that God gives me to bear,\nand then leave with the Lord the results. I must now present the\nmatter in all its bearings; for the people of God must not be despoiled.\nWe are God\u2019s commandment-keeping people. For the past fifty\nyears every phase of heresy has been brought to bear upon us, to\nbecloud our minds regarding the teaching of the Word\u2014especially\nconcerning the ministration of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, and\nthe message of Heaven for these last days, as given by the angels of\nthe fourteenth chapter of Revelation. Messages of every order and\nkind have been urged upon Seventh-day Adventists, to take the place\nof the truth which, point by point, has been sought out by prayerful\nstudy, and testified to by the miracle-working power of the Lord. But\nthe waymarks which have made us what we are, are to be preserved,\nand they will be preserved, as God has signified through His Word\nand the testimony of His Spirit. He calls upon us to hold firmly, with\nthe grip of faith, to the fundamental principles that are based upon\nunquestionable authority.\nSection 5\u2014Christ and the Doctrines [209]\n[210]\nIntroduction\nOver a period of more than sixty years about 2,000 E.G. White\narticles were published in the Review and Herald. Another 2,000\narticles were furnished to the Signs of the Times . Hundreds of\nmessages from her pen appeared in The Youth\u2019s Instructor , our\nhealth journals, the union conference papers, et cetera.\nThese articles covered a wide variety of subjects, including prac-\ntical instruction, warnings and counsel for the church, accounts of\ntravels and labors, instruction in soul-winning work, and perhaps\nmost important, doctrinal presentations. The freedom of space of-\nfered by periodical form of presentation made possible varied and\ndetailed treatment of many important doctrinal topics. The same\nsubjects were dealt with again and again, each time with an empha-\nsis on varying points of interest. In harmony with her instruction,\nthese many articles have been drawn upon in the work of compiling\ncertain Ellen G. White books that have been published since her\ndeath.\nWhile there is not a general call for the republication of all of\nthe articles in their entirely, there is a desire to have a choice group\nof articles devoted largely to doctrinal subjects reprinted in their\ncompleteness of coverage. Many of these are outstanding in their\npresentation of the central truths of the Advent message. These\npriceless messages are here presented for the most part in their\nentirety, giving the reader the benefit of each statement in its full\nsetting. There are a few exceptions where there were large segments\nof an article that were not closely related to the doctrinal presentation,\nand in these cases deletions have been made and indicated in the\nusual way. The careful student of the Word of God will rejoice to\nsee these choice doctrinal statements\u2014all of which center in Christ\nour Lord\u2014appear in this permanent form.\nWhite Trustees.\n194\nChapter 26\u2014The Perfect Law [211]\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, April 5, 1898.]\nThe law of God, as presented in the Scriptures, is broad in its\nrequirements. Every principle is holy, just, and good. The law\nlays men under obligation to God; it reaches to the thoughts and\nfeelings; and it will produce conviction of sin in every one who is\nsensible of having transgressed its requirements. If the law extended\nto the outward conduct only, men would not be guilty in their wrong\nthoughts, desires, and designs. But the law requires that the soul\nitself be pure and the mind holy, that the thoughts and feelings may\nbe in accordance with the standard of love and righteousness.\nIn His teachings, Christ showed how far-reaching are the princi-\nples of the law spoken from Sinai. He made a living application of\nthat law whose principles remain forever the great standard of righ-\nteousness\u2014the standard by which all shall be judged in that great\nday when the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened. He\ncame to fulfill all righteousness, and, as the head of humanity, to\nshow man that he can do the same work, meeting every specifica-\ntion of the requirements of God. Through the measure of His grace\nfurnished to the human agent, not one need miss heaven. Perfection [212]\nof character is attainable by every one who strives for it. This is\nmade the very foundation of the new covenant of the gospel. The\nlaw of Jehovah is the tree; the gospel is the fragrant blossoms and\nfruit which it bears.\nWhen the Spirit of God reveals to man the full meaning of the\nlaw, a change takes place in his heart. The faithful portrayal of his\ntrue state by the prophet Nathan made David acquainted with his\nown sins, and aided him in putting them away. He accepted the\ncounsel meekly, and humbled himself before God. \u201cThe law of the\nLord,\u201d he said, \u201cis perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the\n195\n196 Selected Messages Book 1\nLord is sure, making wise the simple. The statutes of the Lord are\nright, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure,\nenlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for\never: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.\nMore to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:\nsweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them is\nthy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.\nWho can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.\nKeep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not\nhave dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be\ninnocent from the great transgression. Let the words of my mouth,\nand the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord,\nmy strength, and my redeemer\u201d (Psalm 19:7-14).\nPaul\u2019s Estimate of the Law\nPaul\u2019s testimony of the law is: \u201cWhat shall we say then? Is the\nlaw sin [the sin is in the man, not in the law]? God forbid. Nay, I\nhad not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except\nthe law had said, Thou shalt not covet. But sin, taking occasion by\nthe commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For\nwithout the law sin was dead. For I was alive without the law once:\nbut when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the\ncommandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.[213]\nFor sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by\nit slew me\u201d (Romans 7:7-11).\nSin did not kill the law, but it did kill the carnal mind in Paul.\n\u201cNow we are delivered from the law,\u201d he declares, \u201cthat being dead\nwherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and\nnot in the oldness of the letter\u201d (Romans 7:6). \u201cWas that then which\nis good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might\nappear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by\nthe commandment might become exceeding sinful\u201d (Romans 7:13).\n\u201cWherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,\nand good\u201d (Romans 7:12). Paul calls the attention of his hearers to\nthe broken law, and shows them wherein they are guilty. He instructs\nthem as a schoolmaster instructs his scholars, and shows them the\nway back to their loyalty to God.\nPerfect Law 197\nThere is no safety nor repose nor justification in transgression\nof the law. Man cannot hope to stand innocent before God, and at\npeace with Him through the merits of Christ, while he continues in\nsin. He must cease to transgress, and become loyal and true. As the\nsinner looks into the great moral looking glass, he sees his defects\nof character. He sees himself just as he is, spotted, defiled, and\ncondemned. But he knows that the law cannot in any way remove\nthe guilt or pardon the transgressor. He must go farther than this.\nThe law is but the schoolmaster to bring him to Christ. He must\nlook to his sin-bearing Saviour. And as Christ is revealed to him\nupon the cross of Calvary, dying beneath the weight of the sins of\nthe whole world, the Holy Spirit shows him the attitude of God to\nall who repent of their transgressions. \u201cFor God so loved the world,\nthat he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16).\nWe need, individually, to take heed as we have never done before\nto a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d There are men who are disloyal to God,\nwho profane His holy Sabbath, who cavil over the plainest statements\nof the Word, who wrest the Scriptures from their true meaning, and [214]\nwho at the same time make desperate efforts to harmonize their\ndisobedience with the Scriptures. But the Word condemns such\npractices, as it condemned the scribes and Pharisees in Christ\u2019s day.\nWe need to know what is truth. Shall we do as did the Pharisees?\nShall we turn from the greatest Teacher the world has ever known to\nthe traditions and maxims and sayings of men?\nResults of Transgressing the Law\nThere are many beliefs that the mind has no right to entertain.\nAdam believed the lie of Satan, the wily insinuations against the\ncharacter of God. \u201cAnd the Lord God commanded the man, saying,\nOf every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of\nthe knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the\nday that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\u201d (Genesis 2:16, 17).\nWhen Satan tempted Eve, he said, \u201cHath God said, Ye shall not eat\nof every tree of the garden? And the woman said unto the serpent,\nWe may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of\nthe tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall\n198 Selected Messages Book 1\nnot eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent\nsaid unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know\nthat in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye\nshall be as gods, knowing good and evil\u201d (Genesis 3:1-5).\nThe knowledge which God did not want our first parents to have\nwas a knowledge of guilt. And when they accepted the assertions\nof Satan, which were false, disobedience and transgression were\nintroduced into our world. This disobedience to God\u2019s express\ncommand, this belief of Satan\u2019s lie, opened the floodgates of woe\nupon the world. Satan has continued the work begun in the Garden of\nEden. He has worked vigilantly, that man might accept his assertions\nas proof against God. He has worked against Christ in His efforts\nto restore the image of God in man, and imprint in his soul the\nsimilitude of God.\nThe belief of a falsehood did not make Paul a kind, tender, com-[215]\npassionate man. He was a religious zealot, exceedingly mad against\nthe truth concerning Jesus. He went through the country, haling men\nand women, and committing them to prison. Speaking of this, he\nsays: \u201cI am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in\nCilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught\naccording to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was\nzealous toward God, as ye all are this day. And I persecuted this\nway unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men\nand women\u201d (Acts 22:3, 4).\nThe human family are in trouble because of their transgression\nof the Father\u2019s law. But God does not leave the sinner until He shows\nthe remedy for sin. The only-begotten Son of God has died that we\nmight live. The Lord has accepted this sacrifice in our behalf, as\nour substitute and surety, on the condition that we receive Christ\nand believe on Him. The sinner must come in faith to Christ, take\nhold of His merits, lay his sins upon the Sin Bearer, and receive His\npardon. It was for this cause that Christ came into the world. Thus\nthe righteousness of Christ is imputed to the repenting, believing\nsinner. He becomes a member of the royal family, a child of the\nheavenly King, an heir of God, and joint heir with Christ.\nChapter 27\u2014The Character of the Law of God [216]\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, April 15, 1886.]\nDavid says: \u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect\u201d (Psalm 19:7). \u201cCon-\ncerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded\nthem for ever\u201d (Psalm 119:152). And Paul testifies: \u201cThe law is holy,\nand the commandment holy, and just, and good\u201d (Romans 7:12).\nAs the Supreme Ruler of the universe, God has ordained laws for\nthe government not only of all living beings, but of all the operations\nof nature. Everything, whether great or small, animate or inanimate,\nis under fixed laws which cannot be disregarded. There are no\nexceptions to this rule; for nothing that the divine hand has made\nhas been forgotten by the divine mind. But while everything in\nnature is governed by natural law, man alone, as an intelligent being,\ncapable of understanding its requirements, is amenable to moral law.\nTo man alone, the crowning work of His creation, God has given\na conscience to realize the sacred claims of the divine law, and a\nheart capable of loving it as holy, just, and good; and of man prompt\nand perfect obedience is required. Yet God does not compel him to\nobey; he is left a free moral agent.\nThe subject of man\u2019s personal responsibility is understood by but [217]\nfew; and yet it is a matter of the greatest importance. We may each\nobey and live, or we may transgress God\u2019s law, defy His authority,\nand receive the punishment that is meet. Then to every soul the\nquestion comes home with force, Shall I obey the voice from heaven,\nthe ten words spoken from Sinai, or shall I go with the multitude\nwho trample on that fiery law? To those who love God it will be the\nhighest delight to keep His commandments, and to do those things\nthat are pleasing in His sight. But the natural heart hates the law of\nGod, and wars against its holy claims. Men shut their souls from\nthe divine light, refusing to walk in it as it shines upon them. They\n199\n200 Selected Messages Book 1\nsacrifice purity of heart, the favor of God, and their hope of heaven,\nfor selfish gratification or worldly gain.\nSays the psalmist, \u201cThe law of the Lord is perfect\u201d (Psalm 19:7).\nHow wonderful in its simplicity, its comprehensiveness and perfec-\ntion, is the law of Jehovah! It is so brief that we can easily commit\nevery precept to memory, and yet so far-reaching as to express the\nwhole will of God, and to take cognizance, not only of the outward\nactions, but of the thoughts and intents, the desires and emotions,\nof the heart. Human laws cannot do this. They can deal with the\noutward actions only. A man may be a transgressor, and yet conceal\nhis misdeeds from human eyes; he may be a criminal\u2014a thief, a\nmurderer, or an adulterer\u2014but so long as he is not discovered, the\nlaw cannot condemn him as guilty. The law of God takes note of the\njealousy, envy, hatred, malignity, revenge, lust, and ambition that\nsurge through the soul, but have not found expression in outward\naction, because the opportunity, not the will, has been wanting. And\nthese sinful emotions will be brought into the account in the day\nwhen \u201cGod shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret\nthing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil\u201d (Ecclesiastes 12:14).\nGod\u2019s Law Is Simple\nThe law of God is simple, and easily understood. There are men\nwho proudly boast that they believe only what they can understand,\nforgetting that there are mysteries in human life and in the mani-[218]\nfestation of God\u2019s power in the works of nature\u2014mysteries which\nthe deepest philosophy, the most extensive research, is powerless to\nexplain. But there is no mystery in the law of God. All can compre-\nhend the great truths which it embodies. The feeblest intellect can\ngrasp these rules; the most ignorant can regulate the life, and form\nthe character after the divine standard. If the children of men would,\nto the best of their ability, obey this law, they would gain strength of\nmind and power of discernment to comprehend still more of God\u2019s\npurposes and plans. And this advancement would be continued, not\nonly during the present life, but during eternal ages; for however\nfar we may advance in the knowledge of God\u2019s wisdom and power,\nthere is always an infinity beyond.\nCharacter of the Law of God 201\nThe divine law requires us to love God supremely and our neigh-\nbor as ourselves. Without the exercise of this love, the highest\nprofession of faith is mere hypocrisy. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is\nlike unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. On these two\ncommandments,\u201d says Christ, \u201chang all the law and the prophets\u201d\n(Matthew 22:37-40).\nThe law demands perfect obedience. \u201cWhosoever shall keep the\nwhole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all\u201d (James\n2:10). Not one of those ten precepts can be broken without disloyalty\nto the God of heaven. The least deviation from its requirements, by\nneglect or willful transgression, is sin, and every sin exposes the\nsinner to the wrath of God. Obedience was the only condition upon\nwhich ancient Israel was to receive the fulfillment of the promises\nwhich made them the highly favored people of God; and obedience\nto that law will bring as great blessings to individuals and nations\nnow as it would have brought to the Hebrews.\nObedience to the law is essential, not only to our salvation, but\nto our own happiness and the happiness of all with whom we are\nconnected. \u201cGreat peace have they which love thy law: and nothing [219]\nshall offend them\u201d (Psalm 119:165), says the Inspired Word. Yet\nfinite man will present to the people this holy, just, and good law,\nthis law of liberty, which the Creator Himself has adapted to the\nwants of man, as a yoke of bondage, a yoke which no man can\nbear. But it is the sinner who regards the law as a grievous yoke;\nit is the transgressor that can see no beauty in its precepts. For the\ncarnal mind \u201cis not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be\u201d\n(Romans 8:7).\n\u201cBy the law is the knowledge of sin\u201d (Romans 3:20); for \u201csin\nis the transgression of the law\u201d (1 John 3:4). It is through the law\nthat men are convicted of sin; and they must feel themselves sinners,\nexposed to the wrath of God, before they will realize their need of a\nSaviour. Satan is continually at work to lessen man\u2019s estimate of the\ngrievous character of sin. And those who trample the law of God\nunder their feet are doing the work of the great deceiver; for they\nare rejecting the only rule by which they can define sin, and bring it\nhome to the conscience of the transgressor.\n202 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe Law of God reaches to those secret purposes, which, though\nthey may be sinful, are often passed over lightly, but which are in\nreality the basis and the test of character. It is the mirror into which\nthe sinner is to look if he would have a correct knowledge of his\nmoral character. And when he sees himself condemned by that great\nstandard of righteousness, his next move must be to repent of his\nsins, and seek forgiveness through Christ. Failing to do this, many\ntry to break the mirror which reveals their defects, to make void the\nlaw which points out the blemishes in their life and character.\nWe are living in an age of great wickedness. Multitudes are\nenslaved by sinful customs and evil habits, and the fetters that bind\nthem are difficult to break. Iniquity, like a flood, is deluging the earth.\nCrimes almost too fearful to be mentioned, are of daily occurrence.\nAnd yet men professing to be watchmen on the walls of Zion will\nteach that the law was designed for the Jews only, and passed away\nwith the glorious privileges that ushered in the gospel age. Is there[220]\nnot a relation between the prevailing lawlessness and crime, and\nthe fact that ministers and people hold and teach that the law is no\nlonger of binding force?\nThe condemning power of the law of God extends, not only to\nthe things we do, but to the things we do not do. We are not to justify\nourselves in omitting to do the things that God requires. We must\nnot only cease to do evil, but we must learn to do well. God has\ngiven us powers to be exercised in good works; and if these powers\nare not put to use, we shall certainly be set down as wicked and\nslothful servants. We may not have committed grievous sins; such\noffenses may not stand registered against us in the book of God;\nbut the fact that our deeds are not recorded as pure, good, elevated,\nand noble, showing that we have not improved our entrusted talents,\nplaces us under condemnation.\nThe law of God existed before man was created. It was adapted\nto the condition of holy beings; even angels were governed by it. Af-\nter the Fall, the principles of righteousness were unchanged. Nothing\nwas taken from the law; not one of its holy precepts could be im-\nproved. And as it has existed from the beginning, so will it continue\nto exist throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity. \u201cConcerning thy\ntestimonies,\u201d says the psalmist, \u201cI have known of old that thou hast\nfounded them for ever\u201d (Psalm 119:152).\nCharacter of the Law of God 203\nBy this law, which governs angels, which demands purity in\nthe most secret thoughts, desires, and dispositions, and which shall\n\u201cstand fast for ever\u201d (Psalm 111:8), all the world is to be judged\nin the rapidly approaching day of God. Transgressors may flatter\nthemselves that the Most High does not know, that the Almighty\ndoes not consider; He will not always bear with them. Soon they\nwill receive the reward of their doings, the death that is the wages\nof sin; while the righteous nation, that have kept the law, will be\nushered through the pearly gates of the celestial city, and will be\ncrowned with immortal life and joy in the presence of God and the\nLamb.\nChapter 28\u2014Satan\u2019s Enmity Toward the Law[221]\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, January 28, 1909.]\nI awoke from my sleep last night with a great burden upon my\nmind. I was delivering a message to our brethren and sisters, and it\nwas a message of warning and instruction concerning the work of\nsome who are advocating erroneous theories as to the reception of\nthe Holy Spirit, and its operation through human agencies.\nI was instructed that fanaticism similar to that which we were\ncalled to meet after the passing of the time in 1844 would come\nin among us again in the closing days of the message, and that we\nmust meet this evil just as decidedly now as we met it in our early\nexperiences.\nWe are standing on the threshold of great and solemn events.\nProphecies are fulfilling. Strange and eventful history is being\nrecorded in the books of heaven\u2014events which it was declared\nshould shortly precede the great day of God. Everything in the\nworld is in an unsettled state. The nations are angry, and great prepa-\nrations for war are being made. Nation is plotting against nation,\nand kingdom against kingdom. The great day of God is hasting\ngreatly. But although the nations are mustering their forces for war\nand bloodshed, the command to the angels is still in force, that they[222]\nhold the four winds until the servants of God are sealed in their\nforeheads.\nThe world is now realizing the sure results of transgression of\nthe law of God. His work of creation completed, the Lord rested on\nthe seventh day, and sanctified the day of His rest, setting it apart\nas the day which man should devote to His worship. But today the\nworld at large is utterly disregarding the law of Jehovah. Another\nday has been instituted in the place of God\u2019s day of rest. The human\nagent has set his way and his will against the positive teachings of\nthe Word, and the world is plunged in rebellion and sin.\n204\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Toward the Law 205\nThis work of opposition to the law of God had its beginning\nin the courts of heaven, with Lucifer, the covering cherub. Satan\ndetermined to be first in the councils of heaven, and equal with God.\nHe began his work of rebellion with the angels under his command,\nseeking to diffuse among them the spirit of discontent. And he\nworked in so deceptive a way that many of the angels were won to\nhis allegiance before his purposes were fully known. Even the loyal\nangels could not fully discern his character, nor see to what his work\nwas leading. When Satan had succeeded in winning many angels to\nhis side, he took his cause to God, representing that it was the desire\nof the angels that he occupy the position that Christ held.\nThe evil continued to work until the spirit of disaffection ripened\ninto active revolt. Then there was war in heaven, and Satan, with\nall who sympathized with him, was cast out. Satan had warred for\nthe mastery in heaven, and had lost the battle. God could no longer\ntrust him with honor and supremacy, and these, with the part he had\ntaken in the government of heaven, were taken from him.\nSince that time Satan and his army of confederates have been the\navowed enemies of God in our world, continually warring against\nthe cause of truth and righteousness. Satan has continued to present\nto men, as he presented to the angels, his false representations of\nChrist and of God, and he has won the world to his side. Even the\nprofessedly Christian churches have taken sides with the first great\napostate.\nSatan represents himself as the prince of the kingdom of this [223]\nworld, and it was in this character that he approached Christ in the\nlast of his three great temptations in the wilderness. \u201cIf thou wilt fall\ndown and worship me,\u201d he said to the Saviour, \u201call these\u201d\u2014pointing\nto the kingdoms of the world which Satan had caused to pass before\nJesus\u2014\u201cwill I give thee.\u201d\nChrist in the courts of heaven had known that the time would\ncome when the power of Satan must be met and conquered if the\nhuman race was ever to be saved from his dominion. And when\nthat time came, the Son of God laid off His kingly crown and royal\nrobe, and clothing His divinity with humanity, came to the earth to\nmeet the prince of evil, and to conquer him. In order to become\nthe advocate of man before the Father, the Saviour would live His\nlife on earth as every human being must, accepting its adversities\n206 Selected Messages Book 1\nand sorrows and temptations. As the Babe of Bethlehem, He would\nbecome one with the race, and by a spotless life from the manger to\nthe cross He would show that man, by a life of repentance and faith\nin Him, might be restored to the favor of God. He would bring to\nman redeeming grace, forgiveness of sins. If men would return to\ntheir loyalty, and no longer transgress, they would receive pardon.\nChrist in the weakness of humanity was to meet the temptations\nof one possessing the powers of the higher nature that God had\nbestowed on the angelic family. But Christ\u2019s humanity was united\nwith divinity, and in this strength He would bear all the temptations\nthat Satan could bring against Him, and yet keep His soul untainted\nby sin. And this power to overcome He would give to every son and\ndaughter of Adam who would accept by faith the righteous attributes\nof His character.\nGod loved the world so dearly that He gave His only-begotten\nSon that whosoever would accept Him might have power to live\nHis righteous life. Christ proved that it is possible for man to lay\nhold by faith on the power of God. He showed that the sinner, by\nrepentance and the exercise of faith in the righteousness of Christ,\ncan be reconciled to God, and become a partaker of the divine nature,[224]\novercoming the corruption that is in the world through lust.\nToday Satan presents the same temptations that he presented\nto Christ, offering us the kingdoms of the world in return for our\nallegiance. But upon him who looks to Jesus as the author and\nfinisher of his faith, Satan\u2019s temptations have no power. He cannot\ncause to sin the one who will accept by faith the virtues of Him who\nwas tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin.\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife.\u201d He who repents of his sin and accepts the gift of the life of\nthe Son of God, cannot be overcome. Laying hold by faith of the\ndivine nature, he becomes a child of God. He prays, he believes.\nWhen tempted and tried, he claims the power that Christ died to\ngive, and overcomes through His grace. This every sinner needs to\nunderstand. He must repent of his sin, he must believe in the power\nof Christ, and accept that power to save and to keep him from sin.\nHow thankful ought we to be for the gift of Christ\u2019s example!\nSatan\u2019s Enmity Toward the Law 207\nSeek Not to Evade the Cross\nProfound theories and speculations of human creation may\nabound, but he who would come off conqueror in the end, must\nbe humble enough to depend upon divine power. When we thus\ngrasp the power of Infinity, and come to Christ, saying, \u201cIn my hand\nno price I bring; simply to Thy cross I cling,\u201d then divine agencies\ncan cooperate with us to sanctify and purify the life.\nLet no one seek to evade the cross. It is through the cross that\nwe are enabled to overcome. It is through affliction and trial that\ndivine agencies can carry on a work in our lives that will result in\nthe love and peace and kindness of Christ.\nA great work is to be accomplished daily in the human heart by\nthe study of the Word. We need to learn the simplicity of true faith.\nThis will bring its returns. Let us seek for decided advancement in\nspiritual understanding. Let us make the precious Word the man [225]\nof our counsel. We need to walk carefully every moment, keeping\nclose to the side of Christ. The spirit and grace of Christ are needed\nin the life, and the faith that works by love and purifies the soul.\nWe need to understand clearly the divine requirements that God\nmakes of His people. The law, which is the transcript of His charac-\nter, no one need fail to understand. The words written by the finger\nof God on tables of stone so perfectly reveal His will concerning His\npeople that none need make any mistake. The laws of His kingdom\nwere definitely made known, to be afterward revealed to the people\nof all nations and tongues as the principles of His government. We\nwould do well to study those laws recorded in Exodus 20 and in the\nthirty-first chapter, verses 12-18.\nWhen the judgment shall sit, and the books shall be opened,\nand every man shall be judged according to the things written in\nthe books, then the tables of stone, hidden by God until that day,\nwill be presented before the world as the standard of righteousness.\nThen men and women will see that the prerequisite of their salvation\nis obedience to the perfect law of God. None will find excuse for\nsin. By the righteous principles of that law, men will receive their\nsentence of life or of death.\nChapter 29\u2014Christ Our Only Hope[226]\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, August 2, 1905.]\nBefore the foundations of the world were laid, Christ, the Only\nBegotten of God, pledged Himself to become the Redeemer of the\nhuman race, should Adam sin. Adam fell, and He who was partaker\nof the Father\u2019s glory before the world was, laid aside His royal robe\nand kingly crown, and stepped down from His high authority to\nbecome a Babe in Bethlehem, that by passing over the ground where\nAdam stumbled and fell, He might redeem fallen human beings.\nHe subjected Himself to all the temptations that the enemy brings\nagainst men and women; and all the assaults of Satan could not\nmake Him swerve from His loyalty to the Father. By living a sinless\nlife He testified that every son and daughter of Adam can resist the\ntemptations of the one who first brought sin into the world.\nChrist brought men and women power to overcome. He came\nto this world in human form, to live a man amongst men. He\nassumed the liabilities of human nature, to be proved and tried.\nIn His humanity He was a partaker of the divine nature. In His\nincarnation He gained in a new sense the title of the Son of God.\nSaid the angel to Mary, \u201cThe power of the Highest shall overshadow\nthee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall[227]\nbe called the Son of God\u201d (Luke 1:35). While the Son of a human\nbeing, He became the Son of God in a new sense. Thus He stood in\nour world\u2014the Son of God, yet allied by birth to the human race.\nChrist came in human form to show the inhabitants of the un-\nfallen worlds and of the fallen world that ample provision has been\nmade to enable human beings to live in loyalty to their Creator. He\nendured the temptations that Satan was permitted to bring against\nHim, and resisted all his assaults. He was sorely afflicted, and hard\nbeset, but God did not leave Him without recognition. When He\n208\nChrist Our Only Hope 209\nwas baptized of John in Jordan, as He came up out of the water,\nthe Spirit of God, like a dove of burnished gold, descended upon\nHim, and a voice from heaven said, \u201cThis is my beloved Son, in\nwhom I am well pleased\u201d (Matthew 3:17). It was directly after this\nannouncement that Christ was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.\nMark says: \u201cImmediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.\nAnd he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;\nand was with the wild beasts\u201d (Mark 1:12, 13). \u201cAnd in those days\nhe did eat nothing\u201d (Luke 4:2).\nMeeting Temptation\nWhen Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted, He was\nled by the Spirit of God. He did not invite temptation. He went to\nthe wilderness to be alone, to contemplate His mission and work.\nBy fasting and prayer He was to brace Himself for the bloodstained\npath He was to travel. How should He begin His work of freeing the\ncaptives held in torment by the destroyer? During His long fast, the\nwhole plan of His work as man\u2019s deliverer was laid out before Him.\nWhen Jesus entered the wilderness He was shut in by the Father\u2019s\nglory. Absorbed in communion with God, He was lifted above\nhuman weakness. But the glory departed, and He was left to battle\nwith temptation. It was pressing upon Him every moment. His\nhuman nature shrank from the conflict that awaited Him. For forty\ndays He fasted and prayed. Weak and emaciated from hunger, worn [228]\nand haggard with mental agony, \u201chis visage was so marred more\nthan any man, and his form more than the sons of men\u201d (Isaiah\n52:14). Now was Satan\u2019s opportunity. Now he supposed that he\ncould overcome Christ.\nThere came to the Saviour, as if in answer to His prayers, one\nin the guise of an angel of light, and this was the message that he\nbore: \u201cIf thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be\nmade bread\u201d (Matthew 4:3).\nJesus met Satan with the words, \u201cMan shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d\n(Matthew 4:4). In every temptation the weapon of His warfare was\nthe Word of God. Satan demanded of Christ a miracle as a sign\nof His divinity. But that which is greater than all miracles, a firm\n210 Selected Messages Book 1\nreliance upon a \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d was a sign that could not be\ncontroverted. So long as Christ held to this position, the tempter\ncould gain no advantage.\nA familiarity with the Word of God is our only hope. Those who\ndiligently search the Scriptures will not accept Satan\u2019s delusions\nas the truth of God. No one need be overcome by the speculations\npresented by the enemy of God and of Christ. We are not to speculate\nregarding points upon which the Word of God is silent. All that is\nnecessary for our salvation is given in the Word of God. Day by day\nwe are to make the Bible the man of our counsel.\nFrom all eternity Christ was united with the Father, and when\nHe took upon Himself human nature, He was still one with God. He\nis the link that unites God with humanity. \u201cForasmuch then as the\nchildren are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise\ntook part of the same\u201d (Hebrews 2:14). Only through Him can we\nbecome children of God. To all who believe on Him, He gives power\nto become the sons of God. Thus the heart becomes the temple of\nthe living God. It is because Christ took human nature that men and\nwomen become partakers of the divine nature. He brings life and\nimmortality to light through the gospel.\nChapter 30\u2014The Law and the Gospel [229]\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, March 14, 1878.]\nWhen the Jews rejected Christ they rejected the foundation of\ntheir faith. And, on the other hand, the Christian world of today who\nclaim faith in Christ, but reject the law of God are making a mistake\nsimilar to that of the deceived Jews. Those who profess to cling to\nChrist, centering their hopes on Him, while they pour contempt upon\nthe moral law, and the prophecies, are in no safer position than were\nthe unbelieving Jews. They cannot understandingly call sinners to\nrepentance, for they are unable to properly explain what they are to\nrepent of. The sinner, upon being exhorted to forsake his sins, has\na right to ask, What is sin? Those who respect the law of God can\nanswer, Sin is the transgression of the law. In confirmation of this\nthe apostle Paul says, I had not known sin but by the law.\nThose only who acknowledge the binding claim of the moral\nlaw can explain the nature of the atonement. Christ came to mediate\nbetween God and man, to make man one with God by bringing him\ninto allegiance to His law. There was no power in the law to pardon\nits transgressor. Jesus alone could pay the sinner\u2019s debt. But the fact [230]\nthat Jesus has paid the indebtedness of the repentant sinner does not\ngive him license to continue in transgression of the law of God; but\nhe must henceforth live in obedience to that law.\nThe law of God existed before the creation of man or else Adam\ncould not have sinned. After the transgression of Adam the princi-\nples of the law were not changed, but were definitely arranged and\nexpressed to meet man in his fallen condition. Christ, in counsel\nwith His Father, instituted the system of sacrificial offerings; that\ndeath, instead of being immediately visited upon the transgressor,\nshould be transferred to a victim which should prefigure the great\nand perfect offering of the Son of God.\n211\n212 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe sins of the people were transferred in figure to the officiating\npriest, who was a mediator for the people. The priest could not\nhimself become an offering for sin, and make an atonement with his\nlife, for he was also a sinner. Therefore, instead of suffering death\nhimself, he killed a lamb without blemish; the penalty of sin was\ntransferred to the innocent beast, which thus became his immediate\nsubstitute, and typified the perfect offering of Jesus Christ. Through\nthe blood of this victim, man looked forward by faith to the blood of\nChrist which would atone for the sins of the world.\nPurpose of the Ceremonial Law\nIf Adam had not transgressed the law of God, the ceremonial\nlaw would never have been instituted. The gospel of good news\nwas first given to Adam in the declaration made to him that the\nseed of the woman should bruise the serpent\u2019s head; and it was\nhanded down through successive generations to Noah, Abraham,\nand Moses. The knowledge of God\u2019s law, and the plan of salvation\nwere imparted to Adam and Eve by Christ Himself. They carefully\ntreasured the important lesson, and transmitted it by word of mouth,\nto their children, and children\u2019s children. Thus the knowledge of\nGod\u2019s law was preserved.\nMen lived nearly a thousand years in those days, and angels\nvisited them with instruction directly from Christ. The worship of[231]\nGod through sacrificial offerings was established, and those who\nfeared God acknowledged their sins before Him, and looked forward\nwith gratitude and holy trust to the coming of the Day Star, which\nshould guide the fallen sons of Adam to heaven, through repentance\ntoward God and faith toward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\nThus the gospel was preached in every sacrifice; and the works of\nthe believers continually revealed their faith in a coming Saviour.\nJesus said to the Jews: \u201cFor had ye believed Moses, ye would have\nbelieved me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings,\nhow shall ye believe my words?\u201d (John 5:46, 47).\nIt was impossible, however, for Adam, by his example and pre-\ncepts, to stay the tide of woe which his transgression had brought\nupon men. Unbelief crept into the hearts of men. The children\nof Adam present the earliest example of the two different courses\nLaw and the Gospel 213\npursued by men with regard to the claims of God. Abel saw Christ\nfigured in the sacrificial offerings. Cain was an unbeliever in regard\nto the necessity of sacrifices; he refused to discern that Christ was\ntypified by the slain lamb; the blood of beasts appeared to him with-\nout virtue. The gospel was preached to Cain as well as to his brother;\nbut it was to him a savor of death unto death, because he would not\nrecognize, in the blood of the sacrificial lamb, Jesus Christ the only\nprovision made for man\u2019s salvation.\nOur Saviour, in His life and death, fulfilled all the prophecies\npointing to Himself, and was the substance of all the types and shad-\nows signified. He kept the moral law, and exalted it by answering its\nclaims as man\u2019s representative. Those of Israel who turned to the\nLord, and accepted Christ as the reality shadowed forth by the typi-\ncal sacrifices, discerned the end of that which was to be abolished.\nThe obscurity covering the Jewish system as a veil, was to them as\nthe veil which covered the glory upon the face of Moses. The glory\nupon the face of Moses was the reflection of that light which Christ\ncame into the world to bring for the benefit of man.\nWhile Moses was shut in the mount with God, the plan of salva- [232]\ntion, dating from the fall of Adam, was revealed to him in a most\nforcible manner. He then knew that the very angel who was con-\nducting the travels of the children of Israel was to be revealed in the\nflesh. God\u2019s dear Son, who was one with the Father, was to make all\nmen one with God who would believe on, and trust in Him. Moses\nsaw the true significance of the sacrificial offerings. Christ taught\nthe gospel plan to Moses, and the glory of the gospel, through Christ,\nilluminated the countenance of Moses so that the people could not\nlook upon it.\nMoses himself was unconscious of the beaming glory reflected\nupon his face, and knew not why the children of Israel fled from him\nwhen he approached them. He called them to him, but they dared not\nlook upon that glorified face. When Moses learned that the people\ncould not look upon his face, because of its glory, he covered it with\na veil.\nThe glory upon the face of Moses was exceedingly painful to\nthe children of Israel because of their transgression of God\u2019s holy\nlaw. This is an illustration of the feelings of those who violate the\nlaw of God. They desire to remove from its penetrating light which\n214 Selected Messages Book 1\nis a terror to the transgressor, while it seems holy, just, and good to\nthe loyal. Those only who have a just regard for the law of God can\nrightly estimate the atonement of Christ which was made necessary\nby the violation of the Father\u2019s law.\nThose who cherish the view that there was no Saviour in the old\ndispensation, have as dark a veil over their understanding as did the\nJews who rejected Christ. The Jews acknowledged their faith in a\nMessiah to come in the offering of sacrifices which typified Christ.\nYet when Jesus appeared, fulfilling all the prophecies regarding the\npromised Messiah, and doing works that marked Him as the divine\nSon of God, they rejected Him, and refused to accept the plainest\nevidence of His true character. The Christian church, on the other\nhand, who profess the utmost faith in Christ, in despising the Jewish\nsystem virtually deny Christ, who was the originator of the entire\nJewish economy.\nChapter 31\u2014The Law in Galatians [233]\nChrist and the Law\nI am asked concerning the law in Galatians. What law is the\nschoolmaster to bring us to Christ? I answer: Both the ceremonial\nand the moral code of ten commandments.\nChrist was the foundation of the whole Jewish economy. The\ndeath of Abel was in consequence of Cain\u2019s refusing to accept God\u2019s\nplan in the school of obedience to be saved by the blood of Jesus\nChrist typified by the sacrificial offerings pointing to Christ. Cain\nrefused the shedding of blood which symbolized the blood of Christ\nto be shed for the world. This whole ceremony was prepared by\nGod, and Christ became the foundation of the whole system. This is\nthe beginning of its work as the schoolmaster to bring sinful human\nagents to a consideration of Christ the Foundation of the whole\nJewish economy.\nAll who did service in connection with the sanctuary were being\neducated constantly in regard to the intervention of Christ in behalf\nof the human race. This service was designed to create in every\nheart a love for the law of God, which is the law of His kingdom.\nThe sacrificial offering was to be an object lesson of the love of God\nrevealed in Christ\u2014in the suffering, dying victim, who took upon\nHimself the sin of which man was guilty, the innocent being made\nsin for us.\nIn the contemplation of this great theme of salvation we see [234]\nChrist\u2019s work. Not only the promised gift of the Spirit, but also the\nnature and character of this sacrifice and intervention are subjects\nwhich should create in our hearts elevated, sacred, high ideas of the\nlaw of God, which holds its claims upon every human agency. The\nviolation of that law in the small act of eating of the forbidden fruit,\nbrought upon man and upon the earth the consequence of disobedi-\nence to the holy law of God. The nature of the intervention should\n215\n216 Selected Messages Book 1\never make man afraid to do the smallest action in disobedience to\nGod\u2019s requirement.\nThere should be a clear understanding of that which constitutes\nsin, and we should avoid the least approach to step over the bound-\naries from obedience to disobedience.\nGod would have every member of His creation understand the\ngreat work of the infinite Son of God in giving His life for the\nsalvation of the world. \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father\nhath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:\ntherefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not\u201d (1\nJohn 3:1).\nWhen he sees in Christ the embodiment of infinite and disinter-\nested love and benevolence, there is awakened in the heart of the\nsinner a thankful disposition to follow where Christ is drawing.\u2014\nManuscript 87, 1900.\nEspecially the Moral Law\n\u201cThe law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we\nmight be justified by faith\u201d (Galatians 3:24). In this scripture, the\nHoly Spirit through the apostle is speaking especially of the moral\nlaw. The law reveals sin to us, and causes us to feel our need of\nChrist and to flee unto Him for pardon and peace by exercising\nrepentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\nAn unwillingness to yield up preconceived opinions, and to\naccept this truth, lay at the foundation of a large share of the opposi-\ntion manifested at Minneapolis against the Lord\u2019s message through\nBrethren [E.J.] Waggoner and [A.T.] Jones. By exciting that op-\nposition Satan succeeded in shutting away from our people, in a[235]\ngreat measure, the special power of the Holy Spirit that God longed\nto impart to them. The enemy prevented them from obtaining that\nefficiency which might have been theirs in carrying the truth to the\nworld, as the apostles proclaimed it after the day of Pentecost. The\nlight that is to lighten the whole earth with its glory was resisted,\nand by the action of our own brethren has been in a great degree\nkept away from the world.\n* * * * *\nLaw in Galatians 217\nThe law of ten commandments is not to be looked upon as much\nfrom the prohibitory side, as from the mercy side. Its prohibitions\nare the sure guarantee of happiness in obedience. As received in\nChrist, it works in us the purity of character that will bring joy to\nus through eternal ages. To the obedient it is a wall of protection.\nWe behold in it the goodness of God, who by revealing to men the\nimmutable principles of righteousness, seeks to shield them from\nthe evils that result from transgression.\nWe are not to regard God as waiting to punish the sinner for\nhis sin. The sinner brings the punishment upon himself. His own\nactions start a train of circumstances that bring the sure result. Every\nact of transgression reacts upon the sinner, works in him a change\nof character, and makes it more easy for him to transgress again. By\nchoosing to sin, men separate themselves from God, cut themselves\noff from the channel of blessing, and the sure result is ruin and death.\nThe law is an expression of God\u2019s idea. When we receive it in\nChrist, it becomes our idea. It lifts us above the power of natural\ndesires and tendencies, above temptations that lead to sin. \u201cGreat\npeace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them\u201d\n(Psalm 119:165)\u2014cause them to stumble.\nThere is no peace in unrighteousness; the wicked are at war with\nGod. But he who receives the righteousness of the law in Christ\nis in harmony with heaven. \u201cMercy and truth are met together;\nrighteousness and peace have kissed each other\u201d (Psalm 85:10).\u2014\nLetter 96, 1896.\nChapter 32\u2014The Righteousness of Christ in the[236]\nLaw\nChrist and the Law\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, April 22, 1902.]\nThe greatest difficulty Paul had to meet arose from the influence\nof Judaizing teachers. These made him much trouble by causing dis-\nsension in the church at Corinth. They were continually presenting\nthe virtues of the ceremonies of the law, exalting these ceremonies\nabove the gospel of Christ, and condemning Paul because he did not\nurge them upon the new converts.\nPaul met them on their own ground. \u201cIf the ministration of death,\nwritten and engraven in stones, was glorious,\u201d he said, \u201cso that the\nchildren of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for\nthe glory of his countenance; which glory was to be done away:\nhow shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? For\nif the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the\nministration of righteousness exceed in glory\u201d (2 Corinthians 3:7-9).\nThe law of God, spoken in awful grandeur from Sinai, is the\nutterance of condemnation to the sinner. It is the province of the law\nto condemn, but there is in it no power to pardon or to redeem. It is[237]\nordained to life; those who walk in harmony with its precepts will\nreceive the reward of obedience. But it brings bondage and death to\nthose who remain under its condemnation.\nSo sacred and so glorious is the law, that when Moses returned\nfrom the holy mount, where he had been with God, receiving from\nHis hand the tables of stone, his face reflected a glory upon which\nthe people could not look without pain, and Moses was obliged to\ncover his face with a veil.\nThe glory that shone on the face of Moses was a reflection of\nthe righteousness of Christ in the law. The law itself would have no\nglory, only that in it Christ is embodied. It has no power to save. It is\n218\nRighteousness of Christ in the Law 219\nlusterless only as in it Christ is represented as full of righteousness\nand truth.\nThe types and shadows of the sacrificial service, with the prophe-\ncies, gave the Israelites a veiled, indistinct view of the mercy and\ngrace to be brought to the world by the revelation of Christ. To\nMoses was unfolded the significance of the types and shadows point-\ning to Christ. He saw to the end of that which was to be done away\nwhen, at the death of Christ, type met antitype. He saw that only\nthrough Christ can man keep the moral law. By transgression of this\nlaw man brought sin into the world, and with sin came death. Christ\nbecame the propitiation for man\u2019s sin. He proffered His perfection of\ncharacter in the place of man\u2019s sinfulness. He took upon Himself the\ncurse of disobedience. The sacrifices and offerings pointed forward\nto the sacrifice He was to make. The slain lamb typified the Lamb\nthat was to take away the sin of the world.\nIt was seeing the object of that which was to be done away,\nseeing Christ as revealed in the law, that illumined the face of Moses.\nThe ministration of the law, written and engraved in stone, was a\nministration of death. Without Christ, the transgressor was left under\nits curse, with no hope of pardon. The ministration had of itself no\nglory, but the promised Saviour, revealed in the types and shadows\nof the ceremonial law, made the moral law glorious.\nPaul desires his brethren to see that the great glory of a sin- [238]\npardoning Saviour gave significance to the entire Jewish economy.\nHe desired them to see also that when Christ came to the world, and\ndied as man\u2019s sacrifice, type met antitype.\nAfter Christ died on the cross as a sin offering, the ceremonial\nlaw could have no force. Yet it was connected with the moral law,\nand was glorious. The whole bore the stamp of divinity, and ex-\npressed the holiness, justice, and righteousness of God. And if the\nministration of the dispensation to be done away was glorious, how\nmuch more must the reality be glorious, when Christ was revealed,\ngiving His life-giving, sanctifying Spirit to all who believe?\nThe proclamation of the law of ten commandments was a won-\nderful exhibition of the glory and majesty of God. How did this\nmanifestation of power affect the people?\u2014They were afraid. As\nthey saw \u201cthe thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the\ntrumpet, and the mountain smoking,\u201d they \u201cremoved, and stood afar\n220 Selected Messages Book 1\noff. And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will\nhear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die\u201d (Exodus 20:18, 19).\nThey desired Moses to be their mediator. They did not understand\nthat Christ was their appointed mediator, and that, deprived of His\nmediation, they would certainly have been consumed.\n\u201cMoses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove\nyou, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.\nAnd the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick\ndarkness where God was\u201d (Exodus 20:20, 21).\nThe pardon of sin, justification by faith in Jesus Christ, access to\nGod only through a mediator because of their lost condition, their\nguilt and sin\u2014of these truths the people had little conception. In a\ngreat measure they had lost a knowledge of God and of the only way\nto approach Him. They had lost nearly all sense of what constitutes\nsin and of what constitutes righteousness. The pardon of sin through\nChrist, the promised Messiah, whom their offerings typified, was\nbut dimly understood.\nPaul declared, \u201cSeeing then that we have such hope, we use great[239]\nplainness of speech: and not as Moses, which put a vail over his\nface, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of\nthat which is abolished: but their minds were blinded: for until this\nday remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old\ntestament; which vail is done away in Christ. But even unto this day,\nwhen Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart. Nevertheless when\nit shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away\u201d (2 Corinthians\n3:12-16).\nThe Jews refused to accept Christ as the Messiah, and they cannot\nsee that their ceremonies are meaningless, that the sacrifices and\nofferings have lost their significance. The veil drawn by themselves\nin stubborn unbelief is still before their minds. It would be removed\nif they would accept Christ, the righteousness of the law.\nMany in the Christian world also have a veil before their eyes and\nheart. They do not see to the end of that which was done away. They\ndo not see that it was only the ceremonial law which was abrogated\nat the death of Christ. They claim that the moral law was nailed to\nthe cross. Heavy is the veil that darkens their understanding. The\nhearts of many are at war with God. They are not subject to His\nlaw. Only as they shall come into harmony with the rule of His\nRighteousness of Christ in the Law 221\ngovernment, can Christ be of any avail to them. They may talk of\nChrist as their Saviour; but He will finally say to them, I know you\nnot. You have not exercised genuine repentance toward God for the\ntransgression of His holy law, and you cannot have genuine faith in\nMe, for it was My mission to exalt God\u2019s law.\nA Transcript of Christ\u2019s Character\nPaul did not represent either the moral or the ceremonial law as\nministers in our day venture to do. Some cherish such antipathy to\nthe law of God that they will go out of the way to denounce and\nstigmatize it. Thus they despise and pour contempt on the majesty\nand glory of God.\nThe moral law was never a type or a shadow. It existed before\nman\u2019s creation, and will endure as long as God\u2019s throne remains. [240]\nGod could not change nor alter one precept of His law in order to\nsave man; for the law is the foundation of His government. It is\nunchangeable, unalterable, infinite, and eternal. In order for man\nto be saved, and for the honor of the law to be maintained, it was\nnecessary for the Son of God to offer Himself as a sacrifice for\nsin. He who knew no sin became sin for us. He died for us on\nCalvary. His death shows the wonderful love of God for man, and\nthe immutability of His law.\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Christ declared, \u201cThink not that\nI am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to\ndestroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth\npass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all\nbe fulfilled\u201d (Matthew 5:17, 18).\nChrist bore the curse of the law, suffering its penalty, carrying\nto completion the plan whereby man was to be placed where he\ncould keep God\u2019s law, and be accepted through the merits of the\nRedeemer; and by His sacrifice glory was shed upon the law. Then\nthe glory of that which is not to be done away\u2014God\u2019s law of ten\ncommandments, His standard of righteousness\u2014was plainly seen\nby all who saw to the end of that which was done away.\n\u201cWe all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the\nLord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even\nas by the Spirit of the Lord\u201d (2 Corinthians 3:18). Christ is the\n222 Selected Messages Book 1\nsinner\u2019s advocate. Those who accept His gospel behold Him with\nopen face. They see the relation of His mission to the law, and they\nacknowledge God\u2019s wisdom and glory as revealed by the Saviour.\nThe glory of Christ is revealed in the law, which is a transcript of\nHis character, and His transforming efficacy is felt upon the soul\nuntil men become changed to His likeness. They are made partakers\nof the divine nature, and grow more and more like their Saviour,\nadvancing step by step in conformity to the will of God, till they\nreach perfection.\nThe law and the gospel are in perfect harmony. Each upholds the\nother. In all its majesty the law confronts the conscience, causing\nthe sinner to feel his need of Christ as the propitiation for sin. The[241]\ngospel recognizes the power and immutability of the law. \u201cI had not\nknown sin, but by the law,\u201d Paul declares (Romans 7:7). The sense\nof sin, urged home by the law, drives the sinner to the Saviour. In\nhis need man may present the mighty arguments furnished by the\ncross of Calvary. He may claim the righteousness of Christ; for it is\nimparted to every repentant sinner. God declares, \u201cHim that cometh\nto me I will in no wise cast out\u201d (John 6:37). \u201cIf we confess our sins,\nhe is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from\nall unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nChapter 33\u2014\u201cSearch the Scriptures\u201d [242]\nIncarnation\u2014The Nature of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Youth\u2019s Instructor, October 13, 1898.]\nIt is of the highest importance that every human being endowed\nwith reasoning powers should understand his relation to God. In our\nschools the work of redemption is not carefully studied. Many of\nthe students have no real conception of what the plan of salvation\nmeans. God\u2019s word is pledged in our behalf. He who is touched\nwith the feeling of our infirmities invites us: \u201cCome unto me, all ye\nthat labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my\nyoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:\nand ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my\nburden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30).\nStudents, you are safe only as, in perfect submission and obe-\ndience, you connect yourselves with Christ. The yoke is easy, for\nChrist carries the weight. As you lift the burden of the cross, it will\nbecome light; and that cross is to you a pledge of eternal life. It\nis the privilege of each to follow gladly after Christ, exclaiming at\nevery step, \u201cThy gentleness hath made me great\u201d (2 Samuel 22:36).\nBut if we would travel heavenward, we must take the Word of God [243]\nas our lesson book. In the words of Inspiration we must read our\nlessons day by day.\nThe apostle Paul says: \u201cLet this mind be in you, which was also\nin Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery\nto be equal with God: but made himself of no reputation, and took\nupon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of\nmen: and being found in fashion as a man [as the representative of\nthe human race], he humbled himself, and became obedient unto\ndeath, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly\nexalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that\nat the name of Jesus every knee should bow\u201d (Philippians 2:5-10).\n223\n224 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe humiliation of the man Christ Jesus is incomprehensible to\nthe human mind; but His divinity and His existence before the world\nwas formed can never be doubted by those who believe the Word of\nGod. The apostle Paul speaks of our Mediator, the only-begotten\nSon of God, who in a state of glory was in the form of God, the\nCommander of all the heavenly hosts, and who, when He clothed\nHis divinity with humanity, took upon Him the form of a servant.\nIsaiah declares: \u201cUnto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:\nand the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall\nbe called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting\nFather, The Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and\npeace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon\nhis kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with\njustice from henceforth even for ever\u201d (Isaiah 9:6, 7).\nIn consenting to become man, Christ manifested a humility that\nis the marvel of the heavenly intelligences. The act of consenting to\nbe a man would be no humiliation were it not for the fact of Christ\u2019s\nexalted pre-existence. We must open our understanding to realize\nthat Christ laid aside His royal robe, His kingly crown, His high\ncommand, and clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might\nmeet man where he was, and bring to the human family moral power\nto become the sons and daughters of God. To redeem man, Christ[244]\nbecame obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\nThe humanity of the Son of God is everything to us. It is the\ngolden chain that binds our souls to Christ, and through Christ to\nGod. This is to be our study. Christ was a real man; He gave proof\nof His humility in becoming a man. Yet He was God in the flesh.\nWhen we approach this subject, we would do well to heed the words\nspoken by Christ to Moses at the burning bush, \u201cPut off thy shoes\nfrom off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground\u201d\n(Exodus 3:5). We should come to this study with the humility of a\nlearner, with a contrite heart. And the study of the incarnation of\nChrist is a fruitful field, which will repay the searcher who digs deep\nfor hidden truth.\n\u201cSearch the Scriptures\u201d 225\nThe Scriptures Our Guide\nThe Bible is our guide in the safe paths that lead to eternal life.\nGod has inspired men to write that which will present the truth to us,\nwhich will attract, and which, if practiced, will enable the receiver to\nobtain moral power to rank among the most highly educated minds.\nThe minds of all who make the Word of God their study will enlarge.\nFar more than any other study, this is of a nature to increase the\npowers of comprehension, and endow every faculty with new vigor.\nIt brings the mind in contact with broad, ennobling principles of\ntruth. It brings us into close connection with all heaven, imparting\nwisdom, and knowledge, and understanding.\nIn dealing with commonplace productions, and feeding on the\nwritings of uninspired men, the mind becomes dwarfed and cheap-\nened. It is not brought into contact with deep, broad principles of\neternal truth. The understanding unconsciously adapts itself to the\ncomprehension of the things with which it is familiar; and in the\nconsideration of these things the understanding is weakened, its\npowers contracted.\nGod designs that the Scriptures, the source of science that is\nabove all human theory, shall be searched. He desires that man [245]\nshall dig deep in the mines of truth, that he may gain the valuable\ntreasure they contain. But too often human theories and wisdom\nare put in the place of the science of the Bible. Men engage in the\nwork of remodeling God\u2019s purposes; they try to distinguish between\nthe books of the Bible. Through their inventions they make the\nScriptures testify to a lie.\nJust What Man Needs\nGod has not made the reception of the gospel to depend upon\nhuman reasoning. The gospel is adapted for spiritual food, to satisfy\nman\u2019s spiritual appetite. In every case it is just what man needs.\nThose who have felt it necessary to have the students in our schools\nstudy many authors are themselves the most ignorant on the great\nthemes of the Bible. The teachers themselves need to take up the\nBook of all books, and learn from the Scriptures that the gospel has\npower to prove its own divinity to the humble, contrite mind.\n226 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe gospel is the power of God and the wisdom of God. The\ncharacter of Christ on earth revealed divinity, and the gospel which\nHe has given is to be the study of His human heritage in all their\neducational departments, until teachers, children, and youth shall\ndiscern in the only true and living God the object of their faith\nand love and adoration. The Word is to be respected and obeyed.\nThat Book which contains the record of Christ\u2019s life, His work, His\ndoctrines, His sufferings, and final triumphs, is to be the source of\nour strength. We are granted the privileges of school life in this\nworld that we may obtain a fitness for the higher life\u2014the highest\ngrade in the highest school, where, under God, our studies will\ncontinue through the ceaseless ages of eternity.\nChapter 34\u2014The Word Made Flesh [246]\nIncarnation\u2014The Nature of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, April 5, 1906.]\n\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\nthe Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All\nthings were made by him; and without him was not any thing made\nthat was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\nAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it\nnot.\u201d \u201cAnd the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we\nbeheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full\nof grace and truth\u201d (John 1:1-5, 14).\nThis chapter delineates the character and importance of the work\nof Christ. As one who understands his subject, John ascribes all\npower to Christ, and speaks of His greatness and majesty. He flashes\nforth divine rays of precious truth, as light from the sun. He presents\nChrist as the only Mediator between God and humanity.\nThe doctrine of the incarnation of Christ in human flesh is a\nmystery, \u201ceven the mystery which hath been hid from ages and\nfrom generations\u201d (Colossians 1:26). It is the great and profound\nmystery of godliness. \u201cThe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among\nus\u201d (John 1:14). Christ took upon Himself human nature, a nature [247]\ninferior to His heavenly nature. Nothing so shows the wonderful\ncondescension of God as this. He \u201cso loved the world, that he gave\nhis only begotten Son\u201d (John 3:16). John presents this wonderful\nsubject with such simplicity that all may grasp the ideas set forth,\nand be enlightened.\nChrist did not make believe take human nature; He did verily\ntake it. He did in reality possess human nature. \u201cAs the children\nare partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part\nof the same\u201d (Hebrews 2:14). He was the son of Mary; He was of\nthe seed of David according to human descent. He is declared to be\n227\n228 Selected Messages Book 1\na man, even the Man Christ Jesus. \u201cThis man,\u201d writes Paul, \u201cwas\ncounted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath\nbuilded the house hath more honour than the house\u201d (Hebrews 3:3).\nChrist\u2019s Pre-existence\nBut while God\u2019s Word speaks of the humanity of Christ when\nupon this earth, it also speaks decidedly regarding His pre-existence.\nThe Word existed as a divine being, even as the eternal Son of God,\nin union and oneness with His Father. From everlasting He was\nthe Mediator of the covenant, the one in whom all nations of the\nearth, both Jews and Gentiles, if they accepted Him, were to be\nblessed. \u201cThe Word was with God, and the Word was God\u201d (John\n1:1). Before men or angels were created, the Word was with God,\nand was God.\nThe world was made by Him, \u201cand without him was not any\nthing made that was made\u201d (John 1:3). If Christ made all things,\nHe existed before all things. The words spoken in regard to this\nare so decisive that no one need be left in doubt. Christ was God\nessentially, and in the highest sense. He was with God from all\neternity, God over all, blessed forevermore.\nThe Lord Jesus Christ, the divine Son of God, existed from\neternity, a distinct person, yet one with the Father. He was the\nsurpassing glory of heaven. He was the commander of the heavenly\nintelligences, and the adoring homage of the angels was received by[248]\nHim as His right. This was no robbery of God. \u201cThe Lord possessed\nme in the beginning of his way,\u201d He declares, \u201cbefore his works of\nold. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the\nearth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when\nthere were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains\nwere settled, before the hills was I brought forth: while as yet he had\nnot made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of\nthe world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set\na compass upon the face of the depth\u201d (Proverbs 8:22-27).\nThere are light and glory in the truth that Christ was one with\nthe Father before the foundation of the world was laid. This is the\nlight shining in a dark place, making it resplendent with divine,\noriginal glory. This truth, infinitely mysterious in itself, explains\nWord Made Flesh 229\nother mysterious and otherwise unexplainable truths, while it is\nenshrined in light, unapproachable and incomprehensible.\n\u201cBefore the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst\nformed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,\nthou art God\u201d (Psalm 90:2). \u201cThe people which sat in darkness saw\ngreat light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death\nlight is sprung up\u201d (Matthew 4:16). Here the pre-existence of Christ\nand the purpose of His manifestation to our world are presented as\nliving beams of light from the eternal throne. \u201cNow gather thyself\nin troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they\nshall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. But thou,\nBeth-lehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands\nof Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be\nruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been from of old, from\neverlasting\u201d (Micah 5:1, 2).\n\u201cWe preach Christ crucified,\u201d declared Paul, \u201cunto the Jews a\nstumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them\nwhich are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God,\nand the wisdom of God\u201d (1 Corinthians 1:23, 24).\nA Mystery [249]\nThat God should thus be manifest in the flesh is indeed a mys-\ntery; and without the help of the Holy Spirit we cannot hope to\ncomprehend this subject. The most humbling lesson that man has\nto learn is the nothingness of human wisdom, and the folly of try-\ning, by his own unaided efforts, to find out God. He may exert his\nintellectual powers to the utmost, he may have what the world calls\na superior education, yet he may still be ignorant in God\u2019s eyes. The\nancient philosophers boasted of their wisdom; but how did it weigh\nin the scale with God? Solomon had great learning; but his wisdom\nwas foolishness; for he did not know how to stand in moral inde-\npendence, free from sin, in the strength of a character molded after\nthe divine similitude. Solomon has told us the result of his research,\nhis painstaking efforts, his persevering inquiry. He pronounces his\nwisdom altogether vanity.\nBy wisdom the world knew not God. Their estimation of the\ndivine character, their imperfect knowledge of His attributes, did not\n230 Selected Messages Book 1\nenlarge and expand their mental conception. Their minds were not\nennobled in conformity to the divine will, but they plunged into the\ngrossest idolatry. \u201cProfessing themselves to be wise, they became\nfools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image\nmade like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts,\nand creeping things\u201d (Romans 1:22, 23). This is the worth of all\nrequirements and knowledge apart from Christ.\n\u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life,\u201d Christ declares: \u201cno man\ncometh unto the Father, but by me\u201d (John 14:6). Christ is invested\nwith power to give life to all creatures. \u201cAs the living Father hath\nsent me,\u201d He says, \u201cand I live by the Father: so he that eateth me,\neven he shall live by me.\u201d \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh\nprofiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit,\nand they are life\u201d (John 6:57, 63). Christ is not here referring to His\ndoctrine, but to His person, the divinity of His character. \u201cVerily,\nverily, I say unto you,\u201d He says again, \u201cThe hour is coming, and[250]\nnow is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and\nthey that hear shall live. For as the Father hath life in himself; so\nhath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him\nauthority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man\u201d\n(John 5:25-27).\nThe Significance of Christ\u2019s Birth\nGod and Christ knew from the beginning, of the apostasy of\nSatan and of the fall of Adam through the deceptive power of the\napostate. The plan of salvation was designed to redeem the fallen\nrace, to give them another trial. Christ was appointed to the office of\nMediator from the creation of God, set up from everlasting to be our\nsubstitute and surety. Before the world was made, it was arranged\nthat the divinity of Christ should be enshrouded in humanity. \u201cA\nbody,\u201d said Christ, \u201chast thou prepared me\u201d (Hebrews 10:5). But He\ndid not come in human form until the fullness of time had expired.\nThen He came to our world, a babe in Bethlehem.\nNo one born into the world, not even the most gifted of God\u2019s\nchildren, has ever been accorded such demonstration of joy as\ngreeted the Babe born in Bethlehem. Angels of God sang His\npraises over the hills and plains of Bethlehem. \u201cGlory to God in\nWord Made Flesh 231\nthe highest,\u201d they sang, \u201cand on earth peace, good will toward men\u201d\n(Luke 2:14). O that today the human family could recognize this\nsong! The declaration then made, the note then struck, the tune then\nstarted, will swell and extend to the end of time, and resound to the\nends of the earth. It is glory to God, it is peace on earth, good will\nto men. When the Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing\nin His wings, the song then started in the hills of Bethlehem will\nbe reechoed by the voice of a great multitude, as the voice of many\nwaters, saying, \u201cAlleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth\u201d\n(Revelation 19:6).\nBy His obedience to all the commandments of God, Christ\nwrought out a redemption for men. This was not done by going\nout of Himself to another, but by taking humanity into Himself. [251]\nThus Christ gave to humanity an existence out of Himself. To bring\nhumanity into Christ, to bring the fallen race into oneness with di-\nvinity, is the work of redemption. Christ took human nature that\nmen might be one with Him as He is one with the Father, that God\nmay love man as He loves His only-begotten Son, that men may be\npartakers of the divine nature, and be complete in Him.\nThe Holy Spirit, which proceeds from the only-begotten Son of\nGod, binds the human agent, body, soul, and spirit, to the perfect,\ndivine-human nature of Christ. This union is represented by the\nunion of the vine and the branches. Finite man is united to the\nmanhood of Christ. Through faith human nature is assimilated with\nChrist\u2019s nature. We are made one with God in Christ.\nChapter 35\u2014\u201cTempted in All Points Like as We[252]\nAre\u201d\nIncarnation\u2014The Nature of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, June 9, 1898.]\nAfter the fall of man, Satan declared that human beings were\nproved to be incapable of keeping the law of God, and he sought to\ncarry the universe with him in this belief. Satan\u2019s words appeared\nto be true, and Christ came to unmask the deceiver. The Majesty of\nheaven undertook the cause of man, and with the same facilities that\nman may obtain, withstood the temptations of Satan as man must\nwithstand them. This was the only way in which fallen man could\nbecome a partaker of the divine nature. In taking human nature,\nChrist was fitted to understand man\u2019s trials and sorrows and all the\ntemptations wherewith he is beset. Angels who were unacquainted\nwith sin could not sympathize with man in his peculiar trials. Christ\ncondescended to take man\u2019s nature, and was tempted in all points\nlike as we, that He might know how to succor all who should be\ntempted.\nIn assuming humanity Christ took the part of every human being.\nHe was the Head of humanity. A Being divine and human, with His\nlong human arm He could encircle humanity, while with His divine\narm He could lay hold of the throne of the Infinite.\nWhat a sight was this for Heaven to look upon! Christ, who[253]\nknew not the least taint of sin or defilement, took our nature in its\ndeteriorated condition. This was humiliation greater than finite man\ncan comprehend. God was manifest in the flesh. He humbled Him-\nself. What a subject for thought, for deep, earnest contemplation!\nSo infinitely great that He was the Majesty of heaven, and yet He\nstooped so low, without losing one atom of His dignity and glory!\nHe stooped to poverty and to the deepest abasement among men.\nFor our sake He became poor, that we through His poverty might be\n232\n\u201cTempted in All Points Like as We Are\u201d 233\nmade rich. \u201cThe foxes have holes,\u201d He said, \u201cand the birds of the\nair have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head\u201d\n(Matthew 8:20).\nChrist submitted to insult and mockery, contempt and ridicule.\nHe heard His message, which was fraught with love and goodness\nand mercy, misstated and misapplied. He heard Himself called the\nprince of demons, because He testified to His divine Sonship. His\nbirth was supernatural, but by His own nation, those who had blinded\ntheir eyes to spiritual things, it was regarded as a blot and a stain.\nThere was not a drop of our bitter woe which He did not taste, not\na part of our curse which He did not endure, that He might bring\nmany sons and daughters to God.\nThe fact that Jesus was on this earth as a man of sorrows and\nacquainted with grief, that in order to save fallen man from eternal\nruin, He left His heavenly home, should lay in the dust all our pride,\nput to shame all our vanity, and reveal to us the sin of self-sufficiency.\nBehold Him making the wants, the trials, the griefs and sufferings\nof sinful men His own. Can we not take home the lesson that God\nendured these sufferings and bruises of soul in consequence of sin?\nChrist came to the earth, taking humanity and standing as man\u2019s\nrepresentative, to show in the controversy with Satan that man, as\nGod created him, connected with the Father and the Son, could\nobey every divine requirement. Speaking through His servant He\ndeclares, \u201cHis commandments are not grievous\u201d (1 John 5:3). It was\nsin that separated man from his God, and it is sin that maintains this [254]\nseparation.\nThe Prophecy in Eden\nThe enmity referred to in the prophecy in Eden was not to be\nconfined merely to Satan and the Prince of life. It was to be universal.\nSatan and his angels were to feel the enmity of all mankind. \u201cI will\nput enmity,\u201d said God, \u201cbetween thee and the woman, and between\nthy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise\nhis heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15).\nThe enmity put between the seed of the serpent and the seed of\nthe woman was supernatural. With Christ the enmity was in one\nsense natural; in another sense it was supernatural, as humanity and\n234 Selected Messages Book 1\ndivinity were combined. And never was the enmity developed to\nsuch a marked degree as when Christ became an inhabitant of this\nearth. Never before had there been a being upon the earth who hated\nsin with so perfect a hatred as did Christ. He had seen its deceiving,\ninfatuating power upon the holy angels, and all His powers were\nenlisted against it.\nThe purity and holiness of Christ, the spotless righteousness of\nHim who did no sin, was a perpetual reproach upon all sin in a world\nof sensuality and sin. In His life the light of truth was flashed amid\nthe moral darkness with which Satan had enshrouded the world.\nChrist exposed Satan\u2019s falsehoods and deceiving character, and in\nmany hearts destroyed his corrupting influence. It was this that\nstirred Satan with such intense hatred. With his hosts of fallen beings\nhe determined to urge the warfare most vigorously; for there stood\nin the world One who was a perfect representative of the Father,\nOne whose character and practices refuted Satan\u2019s misrepresentation\nof God. Satan had charged upon God the attribute[s] he himself\npossessed. Now in Christ he saw God revealed in His true character\u2014\na compassionate, merciful Father, not willing that any should perish,\nbut that all should come to Him in repentance, and have eternal life.\nIntense worldliness has been one of Satan\u2019s most successful[255]\ntemptations. He designs to keep the hearts and minds of men so\nengrossed with worldly attractions that there will be no room for\nheavenly things. He controls their minds in their love of the world.\nEarthly things eclipse the heavenly, and put the Lord out of their\nsight and understanding. False theories and false gods are cherished\nin the place of the true. Men are charmed with the glitter and tinsel\nof the world. They are so attached to the things of the earth that\nmany will commit any sin in order to gain some worldly advantage.\nIt was on this point that Satan thought to overthrow Christ. He\nthought that in His humanity He could be easily overcome. \u201cThe\ndevil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth\nhim all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; and saith\nunto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down\nand worship me\u201d (Matthew 4:8, 9). But Christ was unmoved. He\nfelt the strength of this temptation; but He met it in our behalf, and\nconquered. And He used only the weapons justifiable for human\n\u201cTempted in All Points Like as We Are\u201d 235\nbeings to use\u2014the word of Him who is mighty in counsel\u2014\u201cIt is\nwritten\u201d (Matthew 4:4, 10).\nWith what intense interest was this controversy watched by the\nheavenly angels and the unfallen worlds, as the honor of the law was\nbeing vindicated. Not merely for this world, but for the universe of\nheaven, was the controversy to be forever settled. The confederacy of\ndarkness was also watching for the semblance of a chance to triumph\nover the divine and human Substitute of the human race, that the\napostate might shout, \u201cVictory,\u201d and the world and its inhabitants\nforever become his kingdom.\nBut Satan reached only the heel; he could not touch the head.\nAt the death of Christ, Satan saw that he was defeated. He saw\nthat his true character was clearly revealed before all heaven, and\nthat the heavenly beings and the worlds that God had created would\nbe wholly on the side of God. He saw that his prospects of future\ninfluence with them would be entirely cut off. Christ\u2019s humanity\nwould demonstrate for eternal ages the question which settled the\ncontroversy.\nSinlessness of Christ\u2019s Human Nature [256]\nIn taking upon Himself man\u2019s nature in its fallen condition,\nChrist did not in the least participate in its sin. He was subject to the\ninfirmities and weaknesses by which man is encompassed, \u201cthat it\nmight be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,\nHimself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses\u201d (Matthew\n8:17). He was touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and was\nin all points tempted like as we are. And yet He knew no sin. He\nwas the Lamb \u201cwithout blemish and without spot\u201d (1 Peter 1:19).\nCould Satan in the least particular have tempted Christ to sin, he\nwould have bruised the Saviour\u2019s head. As it was, he could only\ntouch His heel. Had the head of Christ been touched, the hope of the\nhuman race would have perished. Divine wrath would have come\nupon Christ as it came upon Adam. Christ and the church would\nhave been without hope.\nWe should have no misgivings in regard to the perfect sinlessness\nof the human nature of Christ. Our faith must be an intelligent faith,\nlooking unto Jesus in perfect confidence, in full and entire faith\n236 Selected Messages Book 1\nin the atoning Sacrifice. This is essential that the soul may not be\nenshrouded in darkness. This holy Substitute is able to save to the\nuttermost; for He presented to the wondering universe perfect and\ncomplete humility in His human character, and perfect obedience to\nall the requirements of God. Divine power is placed upon man, that\nhe may become a partaker of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust. This is why repenting,\nbelieving man can be made the righteousness of God in Christ.\nChapter 36\u2014No Caste in Christ [257]\nIncarnation\u2014The Nature of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, December 22,\n1891.]\nThe highest angel in heaven had not the power to pay the ransom\nfor one lost soul. Cherubim and seraphim have only the glory with\nwhich they are endowed by the Creator as His creatures, and the\nreconciliation of man to God could be accomplished only through\na mediator who was equal with God, possessed of attributes that\nwould dignify, and declare him worthy to treat with the infinite God\nin man\u2019s behalf, and also represent God to a fallen world. Man\u2019s\nsubstitute and surety must have man\u2019s nature, a connection with the\nhuman family whom he was to represent, and, as God\u2019s ambassador,\nhe must partake of the divine nature, have a connection with the\nInfinite, in order to manifest God to the world, and be a mediator\nbetween God and man.\nThese qualifications were found alone in Christ. Clothing His\ndivinity with humanity, He came to earth to be called the Son of man\nand the Son of God. He was the surety for man, the ambassador for\nGod\u2014the surety for man to satisfy by His righteousness in man\u2019s\nbehalf the demands of the law, and the representative of God to make\nmanifest His character to a fallen race.\nThe world\u2019s Redeemer possessed the power to draw men to [258]\nHimself, to quiet their fears, to dispel their gloom, to inspire them\nwith hope and courage, to enable them to believe in the willingness\nof God to receive them through the merits of the divine Substitute.\nAs subjects of the love of God we ever should be grateful that we\nhave a mediator, an advocate, an intercessor in the heavenly courts,\nwho pleads in our behalf before the Father.\nWe have everything we could ask to inspire us with faith and\ntrust in God. In earthly courts, when a king would make his greatest\n237\n238 Selected Messages Book 1\npledge to assure men of his truth, he gives his child as a hostage, to\nbe redeemed on the fulfillment of his promise; and behold what a\npledge of the Father\u2019s faithfulness; for when He would assure men of\nthe immutability of His council, He gave His only-begotten Son to\ncome to earth, to take the nature of man, not only for the brief years\nof life, but to retain his nature in the heavenly courts, an everlasting\npledge of the faithfulness of God. O the depth of the riches both\nof the wisdom and love of God! \u201cBehold, what manner of love the\nFather hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of\nGod\u201d (1 John 3:1).\nThrough faith in Christ we become members of the royal family,\nheirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. In Christ we are one.\nAs we come in sight of Calvary, and view the royal Sufferer who\nin man\u2019s nature bore the curse of the law in his behalf, all national\ndistinctions, all sectarian differences are obliterated; all honor of\nrank, all pride of caste is lost.\nThe light shining from the throne of God upon the cross of Cal-\nvary forever puts an end to man-made separations between class and\nrace. Men of every class become members of one family, children\nof the heavenly King, not through earthly power, but through the\nlove of God who gave Jesus to a life of poverty, affliction, and hu-\nmiliation, to a death of shame and agony, that He might bring many\nsons and daughters unto glory.\nIt is not the position, not the finite wisdom, not the qualifications,\nnot the endowments of any person that makes him rank high in the[259]\nesteem of God. The intellect, the reason, the talents of men, are\nthe gifts of God to be employed to His glory, for the upbuilding of\nHis eternal kingdom. It is the spiritual and moral character that is\nof value in the sight of Heaven, and that will survive the grave and\nbe made glorious with immortality for the endless ages of eternity.\nWorldly royalty so highly honored by men will never come forth\nfrom the sepulcher into which it enters. Riches, honor, the wisdom\nof men that have served the purposes of the enemy, can bring to their\npossessors no inheritance, no honor, no position of trust in the world\nwhich is to come. Only those who have appreciated the grace of\nChrist, which has made them heirs of God and joint heirs with Jesus,\nwill rise from the grave bearing the image of their Redeemer.\nNo Caste in Christ 239\nAll who are found worthy to be counted as the members of\nthe family of God in heaven, will recognize one another as sons\nand daughters of God. They will realize that they all receive their\nstrength and pardon from the same source, even from Jesus Christ\nwho was crucified for their sins. They know that they are to wash\ntheir robes of character in His blood, to find acceptance with the\nFather in His name, if they would be in the bright assembly of the\nsaints, clothed in the white robes of righteousness.\nOne in Christ\nThen as the children of God are one in Christ, how does Jesus\nlook upon caste, upon society distinctions, upon the division of\nman from his fellow man, because of color, race, position, wealth,\nbirth, or attainments? The secret of unity is found in the equality\nof believers in Christ. The reason for all division, discord, and\ndifference is found in separation from Christ. Christ is the center to\nwhich all should be attracted; for the nearer we approach the center,\nthe closer we shall come together in feeling, in sympathy, in love,\ngrowing into the character and image of Jesus. With God there is no\nrespect of persons.\nJesus knew the worthlessness of earthly pomp, and He gave no\nattention to its display. In His dignity of soul, His elevation of char- [260]\nacter, His nobility of principle, He was far above the vain fashions\nof the world. Although the prophet describes Him as \u201cdespised and\nrejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief\u201d (Isaiah\n53:3), He might have been esteemed as the highest among the noble\nof the earth. The best circles of human society would have courted\nHim, had He condescended to accept their favor, but He desired not\nthe applause of men, but moved independent of all human influence.\nWealth, position, worldly rank in all its varieties and distinctions of\nhuman greatness, were all but so many degrees of littleness to Him\nwho had left the honor and glory of heaven, and who possessed no\nearthly splendor, indulged in no luxury, and displayed no adornment\nbut humility.\nThe lowly, those bound with poverty, pressed with care, bur-\ndened with toil, could find no reason in His life and example which\nwould lead them to think that Jesus was not acquainted with their\n240 Selected Messages Book 1\ntrials, knew not the pressure of their circumstances, and could not\nsympathize with them in their want and sorrow. The lowliness of\nHis humble, daily life was in harmony with His lowly birth and\ncircumstances. The Son of the infinite God, the Lord of life and\nglory, descended in humiliation to the life of the lowliest, that no one\nmight feel himself excluded from His presence. He made Himself\naccessible to all. He did not select a favored few with whom to\nassociate and ignore all others. It grieves the Spirit of God when\nconservatism shuts man away from his fellow man, especially when\nit is found among those who profess to be His children.\nChrist came to give to the world an example of what perfect\nhumanity might be when united with divinity. He presented to\nthe world a new phase of greatness in His exhibition of mercy,\ncompassion, and love. He gave to men a new interpretation of\nGod. As head of humanity, He taught men lessons in the science of\ndivine government, whereby He revealed the righteousness of the\nreconciliation of mercy and justice. The reconciliation of mercy and\njustice did not involve any compromise with sin, or ignore any claim\nof justice; but by giving to each divine attribute its ordained place,[261]\nmercy could be exercised in the punishment of sinful, impenitent\nman without destroying its clemency or forfeiting its compassionate\ncharacter, and justice could be exercised in forgiving the repenting\ntransgressor without violating its integrity.\nChrist Our High Priest\nAll this could be, because Christ laid hold of the nature of man,\nand partook of the divine attributes, and planted His cross between\nhumanity and divinity, bridging the gulf that separated the sinner\nfrom God.\n\u201cFor verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took\non him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behoved\nhim to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful\nand faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make rec-\nonciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath\nsuffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted\u201d\n(Hebrews 2:16-18).\nNo Caste in Christ 241\n\u201cFor we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with\nthe feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as\nwe are, yet without sin\u201d (Hebrews 4:15).\n\u201cFor every high priest taken from among men is ordained for\nmen in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and\nsacrifices for sins: who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on\nthem that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed\nwith infirmity. And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so\nalso for himself, to offer for sins. And no man taketh this honour\nunto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. So also\nChrist glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that\nsaid unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee. As\nhe saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the\norder of Melchisedec. Who in the days of his flesh, when he had\noffered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears\nunto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that\nhe feared; though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the\nthings which he suffered; and being made perfect, he became the [262]\nauthor of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him\u201d (Hebrews\n5:1-9).\nJesus came to bring moral power to combine with human effort,\nand in no case are His followers to allow themselves to lose sight of\nChrist, who is their example in all things. He said, \u201cFor their sakes I\nsanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth\u201d\n(John 17:19). Jesus presents the truth before His children that they\nmay look upon it, and by beholding it, may become changed, being\ntransformed by His grace from transgression to obedience, from\nimpurity to purity, from sin to heart-holiness and righteousness of\nlife.\nA Special Class in Heaven\nSome among the redeemed will have laid hold of Christ in the last\nhours of life, and in heaven instruction will be given to those who,\nwhen they died, did not understand perfectly the plan of salvation.\nChrist will lead the redeemed ones beside the river of life, and\nwill open to them that which while on this earth they could not\nunderstand.\u2014Letter 203, 1905.\nChapter 37\u2014\u201cEven So Send I You\u201d[263]\nIncarnation\u2014The Nature of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, June 25, 1895.]\n\u201cAs my Father hath sent me, even so send I you\u201d (John 20:21).\nWe are to bear as definite a testimony to the truth as it is in Jesus,\nas did Christ and His apostles. Trusting in the efficiency of the\nHoly Spirit, we are to testify of the mercy, goodness, and love of a\ncrucified and risen Saviour, and thus be agents through whom the\ndarkness will be dispelled from many minds, and cause thanksgiving\nand praise to ascend from many hearts to God. There is a great work\nto be done by every son and daughter of God. Jesus says, \u201cIf ye\nlove me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father, and\nhe shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you\nfor ever\u201d (John 14:15, 16). In His prayer for His disciples, He says\nthat He not only prayed for those in His immediate presence, but\n\u201cfor them also which shall believe on me through their word\u201d (John\n17:20). Again He said, \u201cYe have heard how I said unto you, I go\naway, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice,\nbecause I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than\nI\u201d (John 14:28). Thus we see that Christ has prayed for His people,\nand made them abundant promises to ensure success to them as His[264]\ncolaborers. He said, \u201cGreater works than these [those He did] shall\nhe do; because I go unto my Father\u201d (John 14:12).\nO what great privileges belong to those who are believers and\ndoers of the words of Christ! It is a knowledge of Christ as the sin\nbearer, as the propitiation for our iniquities, that enables us to live a\nlife of holiness. This knowledge is the safeguard for the happiness\nof the human family. Satan knows that without this knowledge we\nshould be thrown into confusion and divested of our strength. Our\nfaith in God would be gone, and we should be left a prey to every\nartifice of the enemy. He has laid subtle plans by which to destroy\n242\n\u201cEven So Send I You\u201d 243\nman. It is his purpose to cast his hellish shadow, like the pall of\ndeath, between God and man, in order that he may hide Jesus from\nour view, so that he may cause us to forget the ministry of love and\nmercy, cut us off from further knowledge of God\u2019s great love and\npower to usward, and intercept every ray of light from heaven.\nChrist alone was able to represent the Deity. He who had been\nin the presence of the Father from the beginning, He who was the\nexpress image of the invisible God, was alone sufficient to accom-\nplish this work. No verbal description could reveal God to the world.\nThrough a life of purity, a life of perfect trust and submission to the\nwill of God, a life of humiliation such as even the highest seraph\nin heaven would have shrunk from, God Himself must be revealed\nto humanity. In order to do this, our Saviour clothed His divinity\nwith humanity. He employed the human faculties, for only by adopt-\ning these could He be comprehended by humanity. Only humanity\ncould reach humanity. He lived out the character of God through\nthe human body which God had prepared for Him. He blessed the\nworld by living out in human flesh the life of God, thus showing that\nHe had the power to unite humanity to divinity.\nOur Mission for Christ\nChrist said: \u201cNo man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither\nknoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever [265]\nthe Son will reveal him\u201d (Matthew 11:27). O how dimly the exalted\nwork of the Son of God is comprehended! He held the salvation of\nthe world in His hands. The commission given to the apostles is also\ngiven to His followers in this age. \u201cRepentance and remission of\nsins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at\nJerusalem\u201d (Luke 24:47). Our Saviour has \u201call power in heaven and\nin earth\u201d (Matthew 28:18), and this power is promised unto us. \u201cYe\nshall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and\nye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea,\nand in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth\u201d (Acts 1:8).\nEven though a church may be composed of poor and uneducated\nand unknown persons, yet if they are believing, praying members,\ntheir influence will be felt for time and for eternity. If they go forth\nin simple faith, relying upon the promises of the Word of God, they\n244 Selected Messages Book 1\nmay accomplish great good. If they let their light shine, Christ is\nglorified in them, and the interests of His kingdom are advanced. If\nthey have a sense of their individual accountability to God, they will\nseek for opportunities to work, and will shine as lights in the world.\nThey will be examples of sincerity and of zealous fervor in working\nout God\u2019s plan for the salvation of souls. The poor, the unlearned,\nif they choose, may become students in the school of Christ, and\nHe will teach them true wisdom. The life of meek, childlike trust,\nof true piety, true religion, will be effective in its influence upon\nothers. Persons who are highly educated are likely to depend more\nupon their book knowledge than upon God. Often they do not seek a\nknowledge of God\u2019s ways by wrestling earnestly with Him in secret\nprayer, laying hold upon the promises of God by faith. Those who\nhave received the heavenly unction will go forth with a Christlike\nspirit, seeking an opportunity to engage others in conversation, and\nto reveal to them the knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom\nHe has sent, whom to know is life eternal. They will become living\nepistles, revealing the Light of the world to mankind.\nChrist has given \u201cto every man his work\u201d (Mark 13:34). He[266]\nexpects every man to do his work with fidelity. High and low, rich\nand poor, all have a work to do for the Master. Every one is called to\naction. But if you do not obey the voice of the Lord, if you do not do\nHis appointed work in firm reliance upon Christ as your sufficiency,\nif you do not follow His example, \u201cunfaithful, slothful servant\u201d will\nbe registered against your name. Unless the light which has been\ngiven you is communicated to others, unless you let your light shine,\nit will go out in darkness, and your soul will be left in awful peril.\nGod speaks to every one who knows the truth, \u201cLet your light so\nshine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify\nyour Father which is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). Communicate the\nknowledge of the truth to others. This is God\u2019s plan to enlighten\nthe world. If you do not stand in your allotted place, if you do not\nlet your light shine, you will become enshrouded in darkness. God\ncalls upon all the sons and daughters of the heavenly family to be\nfully equipped, so that at any period they can step into the ranks\nready for action. The heart made tender and sympathetic by the love\nof Jesus will find the precious pearls designed for the casket of the\nLord Jesus.\nChapter 38\u2014The Temptation of Christ [267]\nThe Temptation of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, July 28, 1874.]\nChrist was not in as favorable a position in the desolate wilder-\nness to endure the temptations of Satan as was Adam when he was\ntempted in Eden. The Son of God humbled Himself and took man\u2019s\nnature after the race had wandered four thousand years from Eden,\nand from their original state of purity and uprightness. Sin had\nbeen making its terrible marks upon the race for ages; and physi-\ncal, mental, and moral degeneracy prevailed throughout the human\nfamily.\nWhen Adam was assailed by the tempter in Eden he was without\nthe taint of sin. He stood in the strength of his perfection before God.\nAll the organs and faculties of his being were equally developed,\nand harmoniously balanced.\nChrist, in the wilderness of temptation, stood in Adam\u2019s place to\nbear the test he failed to endure. Here Christ overcame in the sinner\u2019s\nbehalf, four thousand years after Adam turned his back upon the\nlight of his home. Separated from the presence of God, the human\nfamily had been departing, every successive generation, farther from\nthe original purity, wisdom, and knowledge which Adam possessed\nin Eden. Christ bore the sins and infirmities of the race as they [268]\nexisted when He came to the earth to help man. In behalf of the\nrace, with the weaknesses of fallen man upon Him, He was to stand\nthe temptations of Satan upon all points wherewith man would be\nassailed.\nAdam was surrounded with everything his heart could wish.\nEvery want was supplied. There was no sin, and no signs of decay in\nglorious Eden. Angels of God conversed freely and lovingly with the\nholy pair. The happy songsters caroled forth their free, joyous songs\nof praise to their Creator. The peaceful beasts in happy innocence\n245\n246 Selected Messages Book 1\nplayed about Adam and Eve, obedient to their word. Adam was in\nthe perfection of manhood, the noblest of the Creator\u2019s work. He\nwas in the image of God, but a little lower than the angels.\nChrist as the Second Adam\nIn what contrast is the second Adam as He entered the gloomy\nwilderness to cope with Satan singlehanded! Since the Fall the race\nhad been decreasing in size and physical strength, and sinking lower\nin the scale of moral worth, up to the period of Christ\u2019s advent to\nthe earth. And in order to elevate fallen man, Christ must reach\nhim where he was. He took human nature, and bore the infirmities\nand degeneracy of the race. He, who knew no sin, became sin for\nus. He humiliated Himself to the lowest depths of human woe, that\nHe might be qualified to reach man, and bring him up from the\ndegradation in which sin had plunged him.\n\u201cFor it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all\nthings, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their\nsalvation perfect through sufferings\u201d (Hebrews 2:10). [Hebrews 5:9;\n2:17, 18 quoted.]\n\u201cFor we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with\nthe feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as\nwe are, yet without sin\u201d (Hebrews 4:15).\nSatan had been at war with the government of God, since he\nfirst rebelled. His success in tempting Adam and Eve in Eden, and\nintroducing sin into the world, had emboldened this arch foe, and he\nhad proudly boasted to the heavenly angels that when Christ should\nappear, taking man\u2019s nature, He would be weaker than himself, and[269]\nhe would overcome Him by his power. He exulted that Adam and\nEve in Eden could not resist his insinuations when he appealed to\ntheir appetite. The inhabitants of the old world he overcame in the\nsame manner, through the indulgence of lustful appetite and corrupt\npassions. Through the gratification of appetite he had overthrown\nthe Israelites. He boasted that the Son of God Himself who was\nwith Moses and Joshua was not able to resist his power, and lead the\nfavored people of His choice to Canaan; for nearly all who left Egypt\ndied in the wilderness. Also the meek man, Moses, he had tempted\nto take to himself glory which God claimed. David and Solomon,\nTemptation of Christ 247\nwho had been especially favored of God, he had induced, through\nthe indulgence of appetite and passion, to incur God\u2019s displeasure.\nAnd he boasted that he could yet succeed in thwarting the purpose\nof God in the salvation of man through Jesus Christ.\nIn the wilderness of temptation Christ was without food forty\ndays. Moses had, on especial occasions, been thus long without\nfood. But he felt not the pangs of hunger. He was not tempted and\nharassed by a vile and powerful foe, as was the Son of God. He was\nelevated above the human. He was especially sustained by the glory\nof God which enshrouded him.\nTerrible Effects of Sin Upon Man\nSatan had succeeded so well in deceiving the angels of God, and\nin the fall of noble Adam, that he thought that in Christ\u2019s humiliation\nhe should be successful in overcoming Him. He looked with pleased\nexultation upon the result of his temptations and the increase of\nsin in the continued transgression of God\u2019s law for more than four\nthousand years. He had worked the ruin of our first parents, and\nbrought sin and death into the world, and had led to ruin multitudes\nof all ages, countries, and classes. He had, by his power, controlled\ncities and nations until their sin provoked the wrath of God to destroy\nthem by fire, water, earthquakes, sword, famine, and pestilence. By\nhis subtlety and untiring efforts he had controlled the appetite and\nexcited and strengthened the passions to so fearful a degree, that he [270]\nhad defaced, and almost obliterated the image of God in man. His\nphysical and moral dignity were in so great a degree destroyed, that\nhe bore but a faint resemblance in character, and noble perfection of\nform, to dignified Adam in Eden.\nAt the first advent of Christ, Satan had brought man down from\nhis original, exalted purity, and had dimmed the fine gold with sin.\nHe had transformed the man, created to be a sovereign in Eden, to\na slave in the earth, groaning under the curse of sin. The halo of\nglory, which God had given holy Adam, covering him as a garment,\ndeparted from him after his transgression. The light of God\u2019s glory\ncould not cover disobedience and sin. In the place of health and\nplenitude of blessings, poverty, sickness, and suffering of every type\nwere to be the portion of the children of Adam.\n248 Selected Messages Book 1\nSatan had, through his seductive power, led men through vain\nphilosophy to question and finally to disbelieve in divine revelation\nand the existence of God. He could look abroad upon a world\nof moral wretchedness, and a race exposed to the wrath of a sin-\navenging God, with fiendish triumph that he had been so successful\nin darkening the pathway of so many, and had led them to transgress\nthe law of God. He clothed sin with pleasing attractions to secure\nthe ruin of many.\nBut his most successful scheme in deceiving man has been to\nconceal his real purposes, and his true character, by representing\nhimself as man\u2019s friend and a benefactor of the race. He flatters\nmen with the pleasing fable that there is no rebellious foe, no deadly\nenemy that they need to guard against, and that the existence of a\npersonal devil is all a fiction. While he thus hides his existence, he\nis gathering thousands under his control. He is deceiving them, as\nhe tried to deceive Christ, that he is an angel from Heaven doing a\ngood work for humanity. And the masses are so blinded by sin that\nthey cannot discern the devices of Satan, and they honor him as they\nwould a heavenly angel, while he is working their eternal ruin.\nChapter 39\u2014First Temptation of Christ [271]\nThe Temptation of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, August 4 and 18,\n1874.]\nChrist has entered the world as Satan\u2019s destroyer, and the Re-\ndeemer of the captives bound by his power. He would leave an\nexample in His own victorious life for man to follow and overcome\nthe temptations of Satan. As soon as Christ entered the wilderness\nof temptation, His visage changed. The glory and splendor reflected\nfrom the throne of God which illuminated His countenance when the\nheavens opened before Him, and the Father\u2019s voice acknowledged\nHim as His Son in whom He was well pleased, was now gone. The\nweight of the sins of the world was pressing His soul, and His coun-\ntenance expressed unutterable sorrow, a depth of anguish that fallen\nman had never realized. He felt the overwhelming tide of woe that\ndeluged the world. He realized the strength of indulged appetite and\nof unholy passion that controlled the world, which had brought upon\nman inexpressible suffering. The indulgence of appetite had been\nincreasing, and strengthening with every successive generation since\nAdam\u2019s transgression, until the race was so feeble in moral power\nthat they could not overcome in their own strength. Christ, in behalf\nof the race, was to overcome appetite by standing the most powerful [272]\ntest upon this point. He was to tread the path of temptation alone,\nand there must be none to help Him, none to comfort or uphold Him.\nHe was to wrestle with the powers of darkness.\nAs man could not, in his human strength, resist the power of\nSatan\u2019s temptations, Jesus volunteered to undertake the work, and\nbear the burden for man, and overcome the power of appetite in his\nbehalf. He must show in man\u2019s behalf, self-denial and perseverance,\nand firmness of principle that is paramount to the gnawing pangs\nof hunger. He must show a power of control over appetite stronger\nthan hunger and even death.\n249\n250 Selected Messages Book 1\nSignificance of the Test\nWhen Christ bore the test of temptation upon the point of ap-\npetite, He did not stand in beautiful Eden, as did Adam, with the\nlight and love of God seen in everything His eye rested upon. But He\nwas in a barren, desolate wilderness, surrounded with wild beasts.\nEverything around Him was repulsive, and [that] from which human\nnature would be inclined to shrink. With these surroundings He\nfasted forty days and forty nights, \u201cand in those days he did eat\nnothing\u201d (Luke 4:2). He was emaciated through long fasting, and\nfelt the keenest sense of hunger. His visage was indeed marred more\nthan the sons of men.\nChrist thus entered upon His life of conflict to overcome the\nmighty foe, in bearing the very test Adam failed to endure, that,\nthrough successful conflict, He might break the power of Satan, and\nredeem the race from the disgrace of the Fall.\nAll was lost when Adam yielded to the power of appetite. The\nRedeemer, in whom was united both the human and the divine, stood\nin Adam\u2019s place, and endured a terrible fast of nearly six weeks.\nThe length of this fast is the strongest evidence of the extent of the\nsinfulness and power of debased appetite upon the human family.\nThe humanity of Christ reached to the very depths of human\nwretchedness, and identified itself with the weaknesses and neces-[273]\nsities of fallen man, while His divine nature grasped the Eternal.\nHis work in bearing the guilt of man\u2019s transgression was not to give\nhim license to continue to violate the law of God, which made man\na debtor to the law, which debt Christ was Himself paying by His\nown suffering. The trials and sufferings of Christ were to impress\nman with a sense of his great sin in breaking the law of God, and\nto bring him to repentance and obedience to that law, and through\nobedience to acceptance with God. His righteousness He would\nimpute to man, and thus raise him in moral value with God, so that\nhis efforts to keep the divine law would be acceptable. Christ\u2019s work\nwas to reconcile man to God through His human nature, and God to\nman through His divine nature.\nAs soon as the long fast of Christ commenced in the wilder-\nness, Satan was at hand with his temptations. He came to Christ,\nenshrouded in light, claiming to be one of the angels from the throne\nFirst Temptation of Christ 251\nof God, sent upon an errand of mercy to sympathize with Him, and\nto relieve Him of His suffering condition. He tried to make Christ\nbelieve that God did not require Him to pass through self-denial and\nthe sufferings He anticipated; that he had been sent from heaven\nto bear to Him the message that God only designed to prove His\nwillingness to endure.\nSatan told Christ that He was only to set His feet in the blood-\nstained path, but not to travel it. Like Abraham He was tested to\nshow His perfect obedience. He also stated that he was the angel that\nstayed the hand of Abraham as the knife was raised to slay Isaac, and\nhe had now come to save His life; that it was not necessary for Him\nto endure the painful hunger and death from starvation; he would\nhelp Him bear a part of the work in the plan of salvation.\nThe Son of God turned from all these artful temptations, and\nwas steadfast in His purpose to carry out in every particular, in the\nspirit and in the very letter, the plan which had been devised for the\nredemption of the fallen race. But Satan had manifold temptations\nprepared to ensnare Christ, and obtain advantage of Him. If he\nfailed in one temptation, he would try another. He thought he would [274]\nsucceed, because Christ had humbled Himself as a man. He flattered\nhimself that his assumed character, as one of the heavenly angels,\ncould not be discerned. He feigned to doubt the divinity of Christ,\nbecause of His emaciated appearance and unpleasant surroundings.\nChrist knew that in taking the nature of man He would not\nbe in appearance equal to the angels of heaven. Satan urged that\nif He was indeed the Son of God He should give him evidence\nof His exalted character. He approached Christ with temptations\nupon appetite. He had overcome Adam upon this point and he had\ncontrolled his descendants, and through indulgence of appetite led\nthem to provoke God by iniquity, until their crimes were so great\nthat the Lord destroyed them from off the earth by the waters of the\nFlood.\nUnder Satan\u2019s direct temptations the children of Israel suffered\nappetite to control reason, and they were, through indulgence, led\nto commit grievous sins which awakened the wrath of God against\nthem, and they fell in the wilderness. He thought that he should be\nsuccessful in overcoming Christ with the same temptation. He told\nChrist that one of the exalted angels had been exiled to the world,\n252 Selected Messages Book 1\nand that His appearance indicated that, instead of His being the King\nof heaven, He was the angel fallen, and this explained His emaciated\nand distressed appearance.\nChrist Did No Miracle for Himself\nHe then called the attention of Christ to his own attractive ap-\npearance, clothed with light and strong in power. He claimed to be\na messenger direct from the throne of Heaven, and asserted that he\nhad a right to demand of Christ evidences of His being the Son of\nGod. Satan would fain disbelieve, if he could, the words that came\nfrom heaven to the Son of God at His baptism. He determined to\novercome Christ, and, if possible, make his own kingdom and life\nsecure. His first temptation to Christ was upon appetite. He had,\nupon this point, almost entire control of the world, and his tempta-\ntions were adapted to the circumstances and surroundings of Christ,\nwhich made his temptations upon appetite almost overpowering. [275]\nChrist could have worked a miracle on His own account; but\nthis would not have been in accordance with the plan of salvation.\nThe many miracles in the life of Christ show His power to work\nmiracles for the benefit of suffering humanity. By a miracle of mercy\nHe fed five thousand at once with five loaves and two small fishes.\nTherefore He had power to work a miracle, and satisfy His own\nhunger. Satan flattered himself that he could lead Christ to doubt the\nwords spoken from heaven at His baptism. And if he could tempt\nHim to question His sonship, and doubt the truth of the word spoken\nby His Father, he would gain a great victory.\nHe found Christ in the desolate wilderness without companions,\nwithout food, and in actual suffering. His surroundings were most\nmelancholy and repulsive. Satan suggested to Christ that God would\nnot leave His Son in this condition of want and real suffering. He\nhoped to shake the confidence of Christ in His Father, who had\npermitted Him to be brought into this condition of extreme suffering\nin the desert, where the feet of man had never trod. Satan hoped to\ninsinuate doubts as to His Father\u2019s love that would find a lodgment\nin the mind of Christ, and that under the force of despondency and\nextreme hunger He would exert His miraculous power in His own\nbehalf, and take Himself out of the hand of His heavenly Father.\nFirst Temptation of Christ 253\nThis was indeed a temptation to Christ. But He cherished it not for a\nmoment. He did not for a single moment doubt His heavenly Father\u2019s\nlove, although He seemed to be bowed down with inexpressible\nanguish. Satan\u2019s temptations, though skillfully devised, did not\nmove the integrity of God\u2019s dear Son. His abiding confidence in His\nFather could not be shaken.\nChrist Did Not Parley With Temptation\nJesus did not condescend to explain to His enemy how He was\nthe Son of God, and in what manner, as such, He was to act. In an\ninsulting, taunting manner Satan referred to the present weakness [276]\nand the unfavorable appearance of Christ in contrast with his own\nstrength and glory. He taunted Christ that He was a poor represen-\ntative of the angels, much more of their exalted Commander, the\nacknowledged King in the royal courts. His present appearance in-\ndicated that He was forsaken of God and man. He said if Christ was\nindeed the Son of God, the monarch of heaven, He had power equal\nwith God, and He could give him evidence by working a miracle\nand changing the stone just at His feet into bread, and relieve His\nhunger. Satan promised that, if Christ would do this, he would at\nonce yield his claims of superiority, and that the contest between\nhimself and Christ should there be forever ended.\nChrist did not appear to notice the reviling taunts of Satan. He\nwas not provoked to give him proofs of His power. He meekly bore\nhis insults without retaliation. The words spoken from heaven at\nHis baptism were very precious, evidencing to Him that His Father\napproved the steps He was taking in the plan of salvation as man\u2019s\nsubstitute and surety. The opening heavens, and descent of the\nheavenly dove, were assurances that His Father would unite His\npower in heaven with that of His Son upon the earth, to rescue man\nfrom the control of Satan, and that God accepted the effort of Christ\nto link earth to heaven, and finite man to the infinite.\nThese tokens, received from His Father, were inexpressibly pre-\ncious to the Son of God through all His severe sufferings and terrible\nconflict with the rebel chief. And while enduring the test of God\nin the wilderness, and through His entire ministry, He had nothing\nto do in convincing Satan of His own power, and of His being the\n254 Selected Messages Book 1\nSaviour of the world. Satan had sufficient evidence of His exalted\nstation. His unwillingness to ascribe to Jesus the honor due to Him,\nand manifest submission as a subordinate, ripened into rebellion\nagainst God, and shut him out of heaven.\nIt was not any part of the mission of Christ to exercise His divine\npower for His own benefit, to relieve Himself from suffering. This[277]\nHe had volunteered to take upon Himself. He had condescended to\ntake man\u2019s nature, and He was to suffer the inconveniences, and ills,\nand afflictions of the human family. He was not to perform miracles\non His own account. He came to save others. The object of His\nmission was to bring blessings, and hope, and life, to the afflicted\nand oppressed. He was to bear the burdens and griefs of suffering\nhumanity.\nAlthough Christ was suffering the keenest pangs of hunger, He\nwithstood the temptations. He repulsed Satan with scripture, the\nsame He had given Moses in the wilderness to repeat to rebellious\nIsrael when their diet was restricted, and they were clamoring for\nflesh meats, \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word\nthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d (Matthew 4:4). In this\ndeclaration, and also by His example, Christ would show man that\nhunger for temporal food was not the greatest calamity that could\nbefall him. Satan flattered our first parents that eating of the fruit\nof the tree of life [The tree here referred to is obviously the tree of\nknowledge and not the tree of life. The phrase \u201cof life\u201d is patently a\nprinter\u2019s error. It is not found in the first appearance of this article, in\nThe Signs of the Times, July 9, 1874, nor in the reprint in pamphlet\nform, titled Redemption; or the Temptation of Christ in The Wilder-\nness, 42.\u2014Compilers.] of which God had forbidden them would\nbring to them great good, and would ensure them against death, the\nvery opposite of the truth which God had declared to them. \u201cBut of\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it:\nfor in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die\u201d (Genesis\n2:17). If Adam had been obedient, he would never have known want,\nsorrow, or death.\nIf the people who lived before the Flood had been obedient to\nthe word of God, they would have been preserved, and would not\nhave perished by the waters of the Flood. If the Israelites had been\nobedient to the words of God, He would have bestowed upon them\nFirst Temptation of Christ 255\nspecial blessings. But they fell in consequence of the indulgence of\nappetite and passion. They would not be obedient to the words of\nGod. Indulgence of perverted appetite led them into numerous and [278]\ngrievous sins. If they had made the requirements of God their first\nconsideration, and their physical wants secondary, in submission to\nGod\u2019s choice of proper food for them, not one of them would have\nfallen in the wilderness. They would have been established in the\ngoodly land of Canaan a holy, healthy people, with not a feeble one\nin all their tribes.\nThe Saviour of the world became sin for the race. In becoming\nman\u2019s substitute, Christ did not manifest His power as the Son of\nGod. He ranked Himself among the sons of men. He was to bear the\ntrial of temptation as a man, in man\u2019s behalf, under the most trying\ncircumstances, and leave an example of faith and perfect trust in\nHis heavenly Father. Christ knew that His Father would supply Him\nfood when it would gratify Him to do so. He would not in this severe\nordeal, when hunger pressed Him beyond measure, prematurely\ndiminish one particle of the trial allotted to Him be exercising His\ndivine power.\nFallen man, when brought into straightened places, could not\nhave the power to work miracles on his own behalf, to save himself\nfrom pain or anguish, or to give himself victory over his enemies. It\nwas the purpose of God to test and prove the race, and give them an\nopportunity to develop character by bringing them frequently into\ntrying positions to test their faith and confidence in His love and\npower. The life of Christ was a perfect pattern. He was ever, by His\nexample and precept, teaching man that God was his dependence,\nand that in God should be his faith and firm trust.\nChrist knew that Satan was a liar from the beginning, and it re-\nquired strong self-control to listen to the propositions of this insulting\ndeceiver, and not instantly rebuke his bold assumptions. Satan ex-\npected to provoke the Son of God to engage in controversy with him;\nand he hoped that thus, in His extreme weakness and agony of spirit,\nhe could obtain advantage over Him. He designed to pervert the\nwords of Christ and claim advantage, and call to his aid his fallen\nangels to use their utmost power to prevail against and overcome\nHim.\nThe Saviour of the world had no controversy with Satan, who [279]\n256 Selected Messages Book 1\nwas expelled from heaven because he was no longer worthy of a\nplace there. He who could influence the angels of God against their\nSupreme Ruler, and against His Son, their loved commander, and\nenlist their sympathy for himself, was capable of any deception.\nFour thousand years he had been warring against the government of\nGod, and had lost none of his skill or power to tempt and deceive.\nVictory Through Christ\nBecause man fallen could not overcome Satan with his human\nstrength, Christ came from the royal courts of heaven to help him\nwith His human and divine strength combined. Christ knew that\nAdam in Eden, with his superior advantages, might have withstood\nthe temptations of Satan, and conquered him. He also knew that\nit was not possible for man, out of Eden, separated from the light\nand love of God since the Fall, to resist the temptations of Satan in\nhis own strength. In order to bring hope to man, and save him from\ncomplete ruin, He humbled Himself to take man\u2019s nature, that, with\nHis divine power combined with the human, He might reach man\nwhere he is. He obtains for the fallen sons and daughters of Adam\nthat strength which it is impossible for them to gain for themselves,\nthat in His name they may overcome the temptations of Satan.\nThe exalted Son of God in assuming humanity draws Himself\nnearer to man by standing as the sinner\u2019s substitute. He identifies\nHimself with the sufferings and afflictions of men. He was tempted\nin all points as man is tempted, that He might know how to succor\nthose who should be tempted. Christ overcame on the sinner\u2019s\nbehalf.\nJacob, in the night vision, saw earth connected with heaven by\na ladder reaching to the throne of God. He saw the angels of God,\nclothed with garments of heavenly brightness, passing down from\nheaven and up to heaven upon this shining ladder. The bottom of this\nladder rested upon the earth, while the top of it reached to the highest[280]\nheavens, and rested upon the throne of Jehovah. The brightness from\nthe throne of God beamed down upon this ladder, and reflected a\nlight of inexpressible glory upon the earth.\nThis ladder represented Christ, who had opened the communica-\ntion between earth and heaven. In Christ\u2019s humiliation He descended\nFirst Temptation of Christ 257\nto the very depth of human woe in sympathy and pity for fallen man,\nwhich was represented to Jacob by one end of the ladder resting\nupon the earth, while the top of the ladder, reaching unto heaven,\nrepresents the divine power of Christ, who grasps the Infinite, and\nthus links earth to heaven and finite man to the infinite God. Through\nChrist the communication is opened between God and man. Angels\nmay pass from heaven to earth with messages of love to fallen man,\nand to minister unto those who shall be heirs of salvation. It is\nthrough Christ alone that the heavenly messengers minister to men.\nAdam and Eve in Eden were placed under most favorable cir-\ncumstances. It was their privilege to hold communion with God and\nangels. They were without the condemnation of sin. The light of\nGod and angels was with them, and around about them. The Author\nof their existence was their teacher. But they fell beneath the power\nand temptations of the artful foe. Four thousand years had Satan\nbeen at work against the government of God, and he had obtained\nstrength and experience from determined practice. Fallen men had\nnot the advantages of Adam in Eden. They had been separating\nfrom God for four thousand years. The wisdom to understand, and\npower to resist, the temptations of Satan had become less and less,\nuntil Satan seemed to reign triumphant in the earth. Appetite and\npassion, the love of the world and presumptuous sins, were the great\nbranches of evil out of which every species of crime, violence, and\ncorruption grew.\nChapter 40\u2014Second Temptation of Christ[281]\nThe Temptation of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, August 18, 1874\nand The Review and Herald, September 1, 1874.]\nSatan was defeated in his object to overcome Christ upon the\npoint of appetite; and here in the wilderness Christ achieved a victory\nin behalf of the race upon the point of appetite, making it possible\nfor man in all future time in His name to overcome the strength of\nappetite on his own behalf. Satan was not willing to cease his efforts\nuntil he had tried every means to obtain victory over the world\u2019s\nRedeemer. He knew that with himself all was at stake, whether\nhe or Christ should be victor in the contest. And, in order to awe\nChrist with his superior strength, he carried Him to Jerusalem and\nset Him on a pinnacle of the Temple, and continued to beset Him\nwith temptations.\nHe again demanded of Christ, if He was indeed the Son of God,\nto give him evidence by casting Himself from the dizzy height upon\nwhich he had placed Him. He urged Christ to show His confidence\nin the preserving care of His Father by casting Himself down from\nthe Temple. In Satan\u2019s first temptation upon the point of appetite,\nhe had tried to insinuate doubts in regard to God\u2019s love and care for\nChrist as His Son, by presenting His surroundings and His hunger[282]\nas evidence that He was not in favor with God, He was unsuccessful\nin this. He next tried to take advantage of the faith and perfect trust\nChrist had shown in His heavenly Father to urge Him to presumption.\n\u201cIf thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He\nshall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they\nshall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone\u201d\n(Matthew 4:6). Jesus promptly answered, \u201cIt is written again, Thou\nshalt not tempt the Lord thy God\u201d (Matthew 4:7).\n258\nSecond Temptation of Christ 259\nThe Sin of Presumption\nThe sin of presumption lies close beside the virtue of perfect\nfaith and confidence in God. Satan flattered himself that he could\ntake advantage of the humanity of Christ to urge Him over the line\nof trust to presumption. Upon this point many souls are wrecked.\nSatan tried to deceive Christ through flattery. He admitted that Christ\nwas right in the wilderness in His faith and confidence that God was\nHis Father, under the most trying circumstances. He then urged\nChrist to give him one more proof of His entire dependence upon\nGod, one more evidence of His faith that He was the Son of God,\nby casting Himself from the Temple. He told Christ that if He was\nindeed the Son of God He had nothing to fear; for angels were at\nhand to uphold Him. Satan gave evidence that he understood the\nScriptures by the use he made of them.\nThe Redeemer of the world wavered not from His integrity and\nshowed that He had perfect faith in His Father\u2019s promised care. He\nwould not put the faithfulness and love of His Father to a needless\ntrial, although He was in the hands of the enemy, and placed in a\nposition of extreme difficulty and peril. He would not, at Satan\u2019s\nsuggestion, tempt God by presumptuously experimenting on His\nprovidence. Satan had brought in scripture which seemed appropri-\nate for the occasion, hoping to accomplish his designs by making\nthe application to our Saviour at this special time.\nChrist knew that God could indeed bear Him up if He had re- [283]\nquired Him to throw Himself from the Temple. But to do this\nunbidden, and to experiment upon His Father\u2019s protecting care and\nlove, because dared by Satan to do so, would not show His strength\nof faith. Satan was well aware that if Christ could be prevailed upon,\nunbidden by His Father, to fling Himself from the Temple to prove\nHis claim to His heavenly Father\u2019s protecting care, He would in the\nvery act show the weakness of His human nature.\nChrist came off victor in the second temptation. He manifested\nperfect confidence and trust in His Father during His severe conflict\nwith the powerful foe. Our Redeemer, in the victory here gained, has\nleft man a perfect pattern, showing him that his only safety is in firm\ntrust and unwavering confidence in God in all trials and perils. He\nrefused to presume upon the mercy of His Father by placing Himself\n260 Selected Messages Book 1\nin peril that would make it necessary for His heavenly Father to\ndisplay His power to save Him from danger. This would be forcing\nprovidence on His own account; and He would not then leave for\nHis people a perfect example of faith and firm trust in God.\nSatan\u2019s object in tempting Christ was to lead Him to daring\npresumption, and to show human weakness that would not make Him\na perfect pattern for His people. Satan thought that should Christ\nfail to bear the test of his temptations, there could be no redemption\nfor the race, and his power over them would be complete.\nChrist Our Hope and Example\nThe humiliation and agonizing sufferings of Christ in the wilder-\nness of temptation were for the race. In Adam all was lost through\ntransgression. Through Christ was man\u2019s only hope of restoration to\nthe favor of God. Man had separated himself at such a distance from\nGod by transgression of His law, that he could not humiliate himself\nbefore God proportionate to his grievous sin. The Son of God could\nfully understand the aggravating sins of the transgressor, and in His\nsinless character He alone could make an acceptable atonement for\nman in suffering the agonizing sense of His Father\u2019s displeasure.[284]\nThe sorrow and anguish of the Son of God for the sins of the world\nwere proportionate to His divine excellence and purity, as well as to\nthe magnitude of the offense.\nChrist was our example in all things. As we see His humiliation\nin the long trial and fast in the wilderness to overcome the tempta-\ntions of appetite in our behalf, we are to take this lesson home to\nourselves when we are tempted. If the power of appetite is so strong\nupon the human family, and its indulgence so fearful that the Son\nof God subjected Himself to such a test, how important that we feel\nthe necessity of having appetite under the control of reason. Our\nSaviour fasted nearly six weeks, that He might gain for man the vic-\ntory upon the point of appetite. How can professed Christians with\nan enlightened conscience, and Christ before them as their pattern,\nyield to the indulgence of those appetites which have an enervating\ninfluence upon the mind and heart? It is a painful fact that habits\nof self-gratification at the expense of health, and the weakening of\nSecond Temptation of Christ 261\nmoral power, are holding in the bonds of slavery at the present time\na large share of the Christian world.\nMany who profess godliness do not inquire into the reason of\nChrist\u2019s long period of fasting and suffering in the wilderness. His\nanguish was not so much from enduring the pangs of hunger as\nfrom His sense of the fearful result of the indulgence of appetite and\npassion upon the race. He knew that appetite would be man\u2019s idol,\nand would lead him to forget God, and would stand directly in the\nway of his salvation.\nChapter 41\u2014Third Temptation of Christ[285]\nThe Temptation of Christ\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, September 1,\n1874.]\nOur Saviour showed perfect confidence in His heavenly Father,\nthat He would not suffer Him to be tempted above what He should\ngive Him strength to endure, and would bring Him off conqueror if\nHe patiently bore the test to which He was subjected. Christ had not,\nof His own will, placed Himself in danger. God had suffered Satan,\nfor the time being, to have this power over His Son. Jesus knew that\nif He preserved His integrity in this extremely trying position, an\nangel of God would be sent to relieve Him if there was no other way.\nHe had taken humanity, and was the representative of the race.\nSatan saw that he prevailed nothing with Christ in his second\ngreat temptation. \u201cAnd the devil, taking him up into an high moun-\ntain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment\nof time. And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give\nthee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to\nwhomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all\nshall be thine\u201d (Luke 4:5-7).\nIn the first two great temptations Satan had not revealed his true\npurposes or his character. He claimed to be an exalted messenger[286]\nfrom the courts of heaven, but he now throws off his disguise. In a\npanoramic view he presented before Christ all the kingdoms of the\nworld in the most attractive light, while he claimed to be the prince\nof the world.\nThe Most Alluring Temptation\nThis last temptation was the most alluring of the three. Satan\nknew that Christ\u2019s life must be one of sorrow, hardship, and conflict.\nAnd he thought he could take advantage of this fact to bribe Christ\n262\nThird Temptation of Christ 263\nto yield His integrity. Satan brought all his strength to bear upon\nthis last temptation, for this last effort was to decide his destiny as\nto who should be victor. He claimed the world as his dominion,\nand he was the prince of the power of the air. He bore Jesus to the\ntop of an exceeding high mountain, and then in a panoramic view\npresented before Him all the kingdoms of the world that had been\nso long under his dominion, and offered them to Him in one great\ngift. He told Christ He could come into possession of the kingdoms\nof the world without suffering or peril on His part. Satan promises\nto yield his scepter and dominion, and Christ shall be rightful ruler\nfor one favor from Him. All he requires in return for making over to\nHim the kingdoms of the world that day presented before Him, is,\nthat Christ shall do him homage as to a superior.\nThe eye of Jesus for a moment rested upon the glory presented\nbefore Him; but He turned away and refused to look upon the en-\ntrancing spectacle. He would not endanger His steadfast integrity by\ndallying with the tempter. When Satan solicited homage, Christ\u2019s\ndivine indignation was aroused, and He could no longer tolerate the\nblasphemous assumption of Satan, or even permit him to remain\nin His presence. Here Christ exercised His divine authority, and\ncommanded Satan to desist. \u201cGet thee hence, Satan: for it is written,\nThou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve\u201d\n(Matthew 4:10). Satan, in his pride and arrogance, had declared\nhimself to be the rightful and permanent ruler of the world, the pos- [287]\nsessor of all its riches and glory, claiming homage of all who lived\nin it, as though he had created the world and all things that were\ntherein. Said he to Christ: \u201cAll this power will I give thee, and the\nglory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I\nwill I give it\u201d (Luke 4:6). He endeavored to make a special contract\nwith Christ, to make over to Him at once the whole of his claim, if\nHe would worship him.\nThis insult to the Creator moved the indignation of the Son of\nGod to rebuke and dismiss him. Satan had flattered himself in his\nfirst temptation that he had so well concealed his true character\nand purposes that Christ did not recognize him as the fallen rebel\nchief whom He had conquered and expelled from heaven. The\nwords of dismissal from Christ, \u201cGet thee hence, Satan,\u201d evidenced\nthat he was known from the first, and that all his deceptive arts\n264 Selected Messages Book 1\nhad been unsuccessful upon the Son of God. Satan knew that if\nJesus should die to redeem man, his power must end after a season,\nand he would be destroyed. Therefore, it was his studied plan to\nprevent, if possible, the completion of the great work which had been\ncommenced by the Son of God. If the plan of man\u2019s redemption\nshould fail, he would retain the kingdom which he then claimed.\nAnd if he should succeed, he flattered himself that he would reign in\nopposition to the God of heaven.\nWhen Jesus left heaven, and there left His power and glory, Satan\nexulted. He thought that the Son of God was placed in his power.\nThe temptation took so easily with the holy pair in Eden, that he\nhoped he could with his satanic cunning and power overthrow even\nthe Son of God, and thereby save his life and kingdom. If he could\ntempt Jesus to depart from the will of His Father, as he had done in\nhis temptation with Adam and Eve, then his object would be gained.\nThe time was to come when Jesus should redeem the possession\nof Satan by giving His own life, and, after a season, all in heaven\nand earth should submit to Him. Jesus was steadfast. He chose His\nlife of suffering, His ignominious death, and, in the way appointed[288]\nby His Father, to become a lawful ruler of the kingdoms of the earth,\nand have them given into His hands as an everlasting possession.\nSatan also will be given into His hands to be destroyed by death,\nnevermore to annoy Jesus, or the saints in glory.\nTemptation Decidedly Resisted\nJesus said to this wily foe, \u201cGet thee hence, Satan: for it is\nwritten, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt\nthou serve\u201d (Matthew 4:10). Satan had asked Christ to give him\nevidence that He was the Son of God, and he had in this instance\nthe proof he had asked. At the divine command of Christ he was\ncompelled to obey. He was repulsed and silenced. He had no\npower to enable him to withstand the peremptory dismissal. He was\ncompelled without another word to instantly desist and to leave the\nworld\u2019s Redeemer.\nThe hateful presence of Satan was withdrawn. The contest was\nended. With immense suffering Christ\u2019s victory in the wilderness\nwas as complete as was the failure of Adam. And for a season He\nThird Temptation of Christ 265\nstood freed from the presence of His powerful adversary, and from\nhis legions of angels.\nAfter Satan had ended his temptations he departed from Jesus\nfor a little season. The foe was conquered, but the conflict had been\nlong and exceedingly trying. And after it was ended Christ was\nexhausted and fainting. He fell upon the ground as though dying.\nHeavenly angels who had bowed before Him in the royal courts, and\nwho had been with intense, yet painful, interest watching their loved\nCommander, and with amazement had witnessed the terrible contest\nHe had endured with Satan, now came and ministered unto Him.\nThey prepared Him food and strengthened Him, for He lay as one\ndead. Angels were filled with amazement and awe, as they knew\nthe world\u2019s Redeemer was passing through inexpressible suffering\nto achieve the redemption of man. He who was equal with God in\nthe royal courts, was before them emaciated from nearly six weeks\nof fasting. Solitary and alone He had been pursued by the rebel [289]\nchief, who had been expelled from heaven. He had endured a more\nclose and severe test than would ever be brought to bear upon man.\nThe warfare with the power of darkness had been long and intensely\ntrying to Christ\u2019s human nature in His weak and suffering condition.\nThe angels brought messages of love and comfort from the Father to\nHis Son, and also the assurance that all heaven triumphed in the full\nand entire victory He had gained in behalf of man.\nThe cost of the redemption of the race can never be fully realized\nuntil the redeemed shall stand with the Redeemer, by the throne of\nGod. And as they have capacity to appreciate the value of immortal\nlife, and the eternal reward, they will swell the song of victory and\nimmortal triumph, \u201cSaying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb\nthat was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength,\nand honour, and glory, and blessing\u201d (Revelation 5:12). \u201cAnd every\ncreature,\u201d says John, \u201cwhich is in heaven, and on the earth, and\nunder the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them,\nheard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto\nhim that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and\never\u201d (Revelation 5:13).\nAlthough Satan had failed in his strongest efforts, and most\npowerful temptations, yet he had not given up all hope that he might,\nat some future time, be more successful in his efforts. He looked\n266 Selected Messages Book 1\nforward to the period of Christ\u2019s ministry, when he should have\nopportunities to try his power and artifices against Him. Satan laid\nhis plans to blind the understanding of the Jews, God\u2019s chosen\npeople, that they would not discern in Christ the world\u2019s Redeemer.\nHe thought he could fill their hearts with envy, jealousy, and hatred\nagainst the Son of God, so that they would not receive Him, but\nmake His life upon earth as bitter as possible.\nChapter 42\u2014The Revelation of God [290]\nChrist, Creator and Life-giver\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, November 8,\n1898.]\n\u201cGod, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath\nshined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory\nof God in the face of Jesus Christ\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:6).\nBefore the Fall, not a cloud rested upon the minds of our first\nparents to obscure their clear perception of the character of God.\nThey were perfectly conformed to the will of God. For a covering, a\nbeautiful light, the light of God, surrounded them. The Lord visited\nthe holy pair, and instructed them through the works of His hands.\nNature was their lesson book. In the Garden of Eden the existence of\nGod was demonstrated in the objects of nature that surrounded them.\nEvery tree of the garden spoke to them. The invisible things of God\nwere clearly seen, being understood by the things which were made,\neven His eternal power and Godhead.\nBut while it is true that God could thus be discerned in nature,\nthis does not favor the assertion that after the Fall a perfect knowl-\nedge of God was revealed in the natural world to Adam and his\nposterity. Nature could convey her lessons to man in his innocence;\nbut transgression brought a blight upon nature, and intervened be- [291]\ntween nature and nature\u2019s God. Had Adam and Eve never disobeyed\ntheir Creator, had they remained in the path of perfect rectitude, they\ncould have known and understood God. But when they listened\nto the voice of the tempter, and sinned against God, the light of\nthe garments of heavenly innocence departed from them; and in\nparting with the garments of innocence, they drew about them the\ndark robes of ignorance of God. The clear and perfect light that had\nhitherto surrounded them had lightened everything they approached;\nbut deprived of that heavenly light, the posterity of Adam could no\nlonger trace the character of God in His created works.\n267\n268 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe things of nature upon which we look today give us but a faint\nconception of Eden\u2019s beauty and glory; yet the natural world, with\nunmistakable voice, proclaims the glory of God. In the things of\nnature, marred as they are by the blight of sin, much that is beautiful\nremains. One omnipotent in power, great in goodness, in mercy, and\nlove, has created the earth, and even in its blighted state it inculcates\ntruths in regard to the skillful Master Artist. In this book of nature\nopened to us\u2014in the beautiful, scented flowers, with their varied\nand delicate coloring\u2014God gives to us an unmistakable expression\nof His love. After the transgression of Adam, God might have\ndestroyed every opening bud and blooming flower, or He might have\ntaken away their fragrance, so grateful to the senses. In the earth,\nseared and marred by the curse, in the briers, the thistles, the thorns,\nthe tares, we may read the law of condemnation; but in the delicate\ncolor and perfume of the flowers, we may learn that God still loves\nus, that His mercy is not wholly withdrawn from the earth.\nNature is filled with spiritual lessons for mankind. The flowers\ndie only to spring forth into new life; and in this we are taught the\nlesson of the resurrection. All who love God will bloom again in\nthe Eden above. But nature cannot teach the lesson of the great and\nmarvelous love of God. Therefore, after the Fall, nature was not\nthe only teacher of man. In order that the world might not remain\nin darkness, in eternal spiritual night, the God of nature met us in[292]\nJesus Christ. The Son of God came to the world as the revelation of\nthe Father. He was that \u201ctrue Light, which lighteth every man that\ncometh into the world\u201d (John 1:9). We are to behold \u201cthe light of\nthe knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ\u201d (2\nCorinthians 4:6).\nIn the person of His only-begotten Son, the God of heaven has\ncondescended to stoop to our human nature. To the question of\nThomas, Jesus said: \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man\ncometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should\nhave known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and\nhave seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and\nit sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with\nyou, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me\nhath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?\nBelievest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the\nRevelation of God 269\nwords that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father\nthat dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the\nFather, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works\u2019\nsake\u201d (John 14:6-11).\nThe most difficult and humiliating lesson that man has to learn is\nhis own inefficiency in depending upon human wisdom, and the sure\nfailure of his own efforts to read nature correctly. Sin has obscured\nhis vision, and of himself he cannot interpret nature without placing\nit above God. He cannot discern in it God, or Jesus Christ, whom\nHe has sent. He is in the same position as were the Athenians, who\nerected their altars for the worship of nature. Standing in the midst of\nMars\u2019 Hill, Paul presented before the people of Athens the majesty\nof the living God in contrast with their idolatrous worship.\n\u201cYe men of Athens,\u201d he said, \u201cI perceive that in all things ye are\ntoo superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I\nfound an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.\nWhom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.\nGod that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is [293]\nLord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;\nneither is worshipped with men\u2019s hands, as though he needed any\nthing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; and\nhath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the\nface of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed,\nand the bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if\nhaply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far\nfrom every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our\nbeings; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also\nhis offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we\nought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or\nstone, graven by art and man\u2019s device\u201d (Acts 17:22-29).\nNature Is Not God\nThose who have a true knowledge of God will not become so\ninfatuated with the laws of matter or the operations of nature as to\noverlook, or refuse to acknowledge, the continual working of God in\nnature. Nature is not God, nor was it ever God. The voice of nature\ntestifies of God, but nature is not God. As His created work, it simply\n270 Selected Messages Book 1\nbears a testimony to God\u2019s power. Deity is the author of nature. The\nnatural world has, in itself, no power but that which God supplies.\nThere is a personal God, the Father; there is a personal Christ, the\nSon. And \u201cGod, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake\nin time past unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days\nspoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things,\nby whom also he made the worlds; who being the brightness of his\nglory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things\nby the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins,\nsat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high\u201d (Hebrews 1:1-3).\nThe psalmist says: \u201cThe heavens declare the glory of God; and\nthe firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech,\nand night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor\nlanguage, where their voice is not heard\u201d (Psalm 19:1-3). Some[294]\nmay suppose that these grand things in the natural world are God.\nThey are not God. All these wonders in the heavens are only doing\nthe work appointed them. They are the Lord\u2019s agencies. God is\nthe superintendent, as well as the Creator, of all things. The Divine\nBeing is engaged in upholding the things that He has created. The\nsame hand that holds the mountains and balances them in position,\nguides the worlds in their mysterious march around the sun.\nThere is scarcely an operation of nature to which we may not\nfind reference in the Word of God. The Word declares that \u201che\nmaketh his sun to rise,\u201d and the rain to descend (Matthew 5:45). He\n\u201cmaketh grass to grow upon the mountains.\u201d \u201cHe giveth snow like\nwool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes. He casteth forth his\nice like morsels.... He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he\ncauseth his wind to blow, and the waters flow\u201d (Psalm 147:8, 16-18).\n\u201cHe maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his\ntreasuries\u201d (Psalm 135:7).\nThese words of Holy Writ say nothing of the independent laws\nof nature. God furnishes the matter and the properties with which\nto carry out His plans. He employs His agencies that vegetation\nmay flourish. He sends the dew and the rain and the sunshine, that\nverdure may spring forth, and spread its carpet over the earth; that\nthe shrubs and fruit trees may bud and blossom and bring forth. It is\nnot to be supposed that a law is set in motion for the seed to work\nitself, that the leaf appears because it must do so of itself. God has\nRevelation of God 271\nlaws that He has instituted, but they are only the servants through\nwhich He effects results. It is through the immediate agency of God\nthat every tiny seed breaks through the earth, and springs into life.\nEvery leaf grows, every flower blooms, by the power of God.\nThe physical organism of man is under the supervision of God;\nbut it is not like a clock, which is set in operation, and must go of\nitself. The heart beats, pulse succeeds pulse, breath succeeds breath,\nbut the entire being is under the supervision of God. \u201cYe are God\u2019s\nhusbandry, ye are God\u2019s building (1 Corinthians 3:9). In God we [295]\nlive and move and have our being. Each heartbeat, each breath, is\nthe inspiration of Him who breathed into the nostrils of Adam the\nbreath of life\u2014the inspiration of the ever-present God, the great I",

      "text": "The ancient philosophers prided themselves on their superior\nknowledge. Let us read the inspired apostle\u2019s understanding of the\nmatter. \u201cProfessing themselves to be wise,\u201d he says, \u201cthey became\nfools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image\nmade like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts,\nand creeping things.... Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and\nworshipped and served the creature more than the Creator\u201d (Romans\n1:22-25). In its human wisdom the world cannot know God. Its\nwise men gather an imperfect knowledge of God from His created\nworks, and then in their foolishness they exalt nature and the laws of\nnature above nature\u2019s God. Those who have not a knowledge of God\nthrough an acceptance of the revelation He has made of Himself in\nChrist, will obtain only an imperfect knowledge of Him in nature;\nand this knowledge, so far from giving elevated conceptions of God,\nand bringing the whole being into conformity to His will, will make\nmen idolaters. Professing themselves to be wise, they will become\nfools.\nThose who think they can obtain a knowledge of God aside from\nHis Representative, whom the Word declares is \u201cthe express image\nof his person\u201d (Hebrews 1:3), will need to become fools in their\nown estimation before they can be wise. It is impossible to gain\na perfect knowledge of God from nature alone; for nature itself is\nimperfect. In its imperfection it cannot represent God, it cannot\nreveal the character of God in its moral perfection. But Christ came\nas a personal Saviour to the world. He represented a personal God.\n272 Selected Messages Book 1\nAs a personal Saviour, He ascended on high; and He will come again\nas He ascended to heaven\u2014a personal Saviour. He is the express\nimage of the Father\u2019s person. \u201cIn him dwelleth all the fulness of the\nGodhead bodily\u201d (Colossians 2:9).\nChapter 43\u2014Christ the Life-giver [296]\nChrist, Creator and Life-giver\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, April 8, 1897.]\n\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\nthe Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All\nthings were made by him; and without him was not any thing made\nthat was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\nAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it\nnot\u201d (John 1:1-5). The world did not see divinity in the humble Man\nof Nazareth. The only-begotten Son of the infinite God was in the\nworld, and men knew Him not in His true character.\n\u201cIn him was life; and the life was the light of men\u201d (John 1:4).\nIt is not physical life that is here specified, but immortality, the life\nwhich is exclusively the property of God. The Word, who was with\nGod, and who was God, had this life. Physical life is something\nwhich each individual receives. It is not eternal or immortal; for\nGod, the Life-giver, takes it again. Man has no control over his life.\nBut the life of Christ was unborrowed. No one can take this life\nfrom Him. \u201cI lay it down of myself\u201d (John 10:18), He said. In Him\nwas life, original, unborrowed, underived. This life is not inherent\nin man. He can possess it only through Christ. He cannot earn it; it [297]\nis given him as a free gift if he will believe in Christ as His personal\nSaviour. \u201cThis is life eternal, that they might know thee the only\ntrue God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (John 17:3). This\nis the open fountain of life for the world.\nGiving his charge to Timothy, Paul says, \u201cBut thou, O man of\nGod, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness,\nfaith, love, patience, meekness. Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold\non eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a\ngood profession before many witnesses. I give thee charge in the\nsight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who\n273\n274 Selected Messages Book 1\nbefore Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; that thou keep\nthis commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing\nof our Lord Jesus Christ: which in his times he shall shew, who is\nthe blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, the Lord of lords;\nwho only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can\napproach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be\nhonour and power everlasting\u201d (1 Timothy 6:11-16).\nWriting again, Paul says: \u201cThis is a faithful saying, and worthy of\nall acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners;\nof whom I am chief. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in\nme first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern\nto them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.\nNow unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God,\nbe honour and glory for ever and ever\u201d (1 Timothy 1:15-17).\nImmortality Brought by Christ\nChrist \u201cbrought life and immortality to light through the gospel\u201d\n(2 Timothy 1:10). No man can have an independent spiritual life\napart from Him. The sinner is not immortal; for God has said, \u201cThe\nsoul that sinneth, it shall die\u201d (Ezekiel 18:4). This means all that it\nexpresses. It reaches farther than the death which is common to all;\nit means the second death. Men start back at this, saying, Would you[298]\nmake man no more than a beast? This is thought to be degrading. But\nwhat is it that elevates man in the sight of God? Is it his accumulation\nof money?\u2014No; for God declares, The gold and the silver are mine.\nIf man abuses his entrusted treasures, God can scatter faster than\nman can gather. Man may have brilliant intellect; he may be rich\nin the possession of natural endowments. But these are all given\nhim by God, his Maker. God can remove the gift of reason, and in a\nmoment man will become as Nebuchadnezzar, degraded to the level\nof the beasts of the field. This God does because man acts as though\nhis wisdom and power had been gotten independently of Him.\nMan is only mortal, and while he feels himself too wise to accept\nJesus, he will remain only mortal. Men have done wonderful things\nin the intellectual world, but who gave them power to do this?\u2014\nThe Lord God of hosts. If in their fancied efficiency men triumph\nbecause of their own power, and glorify themselves, following the\nChrist the Life-giver 275\nexample of the antediluvian world, they will perish. The imagination\nof that long-lived race was only evil, and that continually. They were\nwise to do evil, and the earth was corrupted under the inhabitants\nthereof. Had they connected themselves with the One who is infinite\nin wisdom, they could have done marvelous things with their God-\ngiven ability and talents. But, turning from God, they chose to follow\nSatan\u2019s lead, as many today are doing; and the Lord swept them\nfrom the earth, with all their boasted knowledge.\nHumanity may be exalted by the world for what it has done. But\nman can lower himself very fast in God\u2019s sight by misapplying and\nmisappropriating his entrusted talents, which, if rightly used, would\nelevate him. While the Lord is long-suffering and not willing that\nany shall perish, He will by no means clear the guilty. Let all take\nheed to the words of the Lord. \u201cWherefore kick ye at my sacrifice\nand at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation;\nand honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the [299]\nchiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? Wherefore the Lord\nGod of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of\nthy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the Lord saith,\nBe it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they\nthat despise me shall be lightly esteemed\u201d (1 Samuel 2:29-30).\nGod honors those who obey Him. \u201cThe Lord rewarded me\naccording to my righteousness,\u201d said David; \u201caccording to the clean-\nness of my hands hath he recompensed me. For I have kept the ways\nof the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God. For all\nhis judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes\nfrom me\u201d (Psalm 18:20-22).\nHow to Obtain Everlasting Life\nOnly the believer in Christ can receive life everlasting. Only\nby continually feeding on Christ\u2019s flesh and blood can we have the\nassurance that we are partakers of the divine nature. No one should\nbe indifferent on this subject, saying, If we are honest, it is no matter\nwhat we believe. You cannot with safety surrender any seed of vital\ntruth in order to please yourself or anybody else. Do not seek to\navoid the cross. If we receive no light from the Sun of Righteousness,\n276 Selected Messages Book 1\nwe have no connection with the Source of all light; and if this life\nand light do not abide in us, we can never be saved.\nGod has made every provision that His purpose in the creation of\nman shall not be frustrated by Satan. After Adam and Eve brought\ndeath into the world by their disobedience, a costly sacrifice was\nprovided for the human race. A higher value than that they originally\npossessed was placed upon them. By giving Christ, His only-begot-\nten Son, as a ransom for the world, God gave all heaven.\nThe acceptance of Christ gives value to the human being. His\nsacrifice carries life and light to all who take Christ as their personal\nSaviour. The love of God through Jesus Christ is shed abroad in the\nheart of every member of His body, carrying with it the vitality of\nthe law of God the Father. Thus God may dwell with man, and man[300]\nmay dwell with God. Paul declared, \u201cI am crucified with Christ:\nnevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life\nwhich I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God,\nwho loved me, and gave himself for me\u201d (Galatians 2:20).\nIf through faith man becomes one with Christ, he can win life\neverlasting. God loves those who are redeemed through Christ, even\nas He loves His Son. What a thought! Can God love the sinner\nas He loves His own Son?\u2014Yes; Christ has said it, and He means\njust what He says. He will honor all our drafts if we will grasp His\npromise by living faith, and put our trust in Him. Look to Him, and\nlive. All who obey God are embraced in the prayer which Christ\noffered to His Father, \u201cI have declared unto them thy name, and will\ndeclare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in\nthem, and I in them\u201d (John 17:26). Wonderful truth, too difficult for\nhumanity to comprehend!\nChrist declares: \u201cI am the bread of life: he that cometh to me\nshall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst\u201d\n(John 6:35). \u201cAnd this is the will of him that sent me, that every one\nwhich seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting\nlife: and I will raise him up at the last day\u201d (John 6:40). \u201cVerily,\nverily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life\u201d\n(John 6:47). \u201cExcept ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his\nblood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh\nmy blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.\nFor my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that\nChrist the Life-giver 277\neateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in\nhim. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so\nhe that eateth me, even he shall live by me. This is that bread which\ncame down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are\ndead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever\u201d (John 6:53-58).\n\u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words\nthat I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life\u201d (John 6:63).\nChapter 44\u2014The Risen Saviour[301]\nChrist, Creator and Life-giver\n[This article appeared in The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 4, 1898.]\n\u201cI am the resurrection, and the life\u201d (John 11:25). He who had\nsaid, \u201cI lay down my life, that I might take it again\u201d (John 10:17),\ncame forth from the grave to life that was in Himself. Humanity\ndied; divinity did not die. In His divinity, Christ possessed the power\nto break the bonds of death. He declares that He has life in Himself\nto quicken whom He will.\nAll created beings live by the will and power of God. They are\nrecipients of the life of the Son of God. However able and talented,\nhowever large their capacities, they are replenished with life from\nthe Source of all life. He is the spring, the fountain, of life. Only\nHe who alone hath immortality, dwelling in light and life, could say,\n\u201cI have power to lay it [my life] down, and I have power to take it\nagain\u201d (John 10:18).\nThe words of Christ, \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life\u201d (John\n11:25), were distinctly heard by the Roman guard. The whole army\nof Satan heard them. And we understand them when we hear. Christ\nhad come to give His life a ransom for many. As the Good Shepherd,\nHe had laid down His life for the sheep. It was the righteousness\nof God to maintain His law by inflicting the penalty. This was the[302]\nonly way in which the law could be maintained, and pronounced\nholy, and just, and good. It was the only way by which sin could\nbe made to appear exceeding sinful, and the honor and majesty of\ndivine authority be maintained.\nThe law of God\u2019s government was to be magnified by the death\nof God\u2019s only-begotten Son. Christ bore the guilt of the sins of the\nworld. Our sufficiency is found only in the incarnation and death\nof the Son of God. He could suffer, because sustained by divinity.\nHe could endure, because He was without one taint of disloyalty or\n278\nRisen Saviour 279\nsin. Christ triumphed in man\u2019s behalf in thus bearing the justice of\npunishment. He secured eternal life to men, while He exalted the\nlaw, and made it honorable.\nChrist was invested with the right to give immortality. The life\nwhich He had laid down in humanity, He again took up and gave\nto humanity. \u201cI am come,\u201d He says, \u201cthat they might have life, and\nthat they might have it more abundantly\u201d (John 10:10). \u201cWhoso\neateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will\nraise him up at the last day\u201d (John 6:54). \u201cWhosoever drinketh of\nthe water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that\nI shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into\neverlasting life\u201d (John 4:14).\nAll who are one with Christ through faith in Him gain an experi-\nence which is life unto eternal life. \u201cAs the living Father hath sent\nme, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live\nby me\u201d (John 6:57). He \u201cdwelleth in me, and I in him\u201d (John 6:56).\n\u201cI will raise him up at the last day\u201d (John 6:54). \u201cBecause I live, ye\nshall live also\u201d (John 14:19).\nChrist became one with humanity, that humanity might become\none in spirit and life with Him. By virtue of this union in obedience\nto the Word of God, His life becomes their life. He says to the\npenitent, \u201cI am the resurrection, and the life\u201d (John 11:25). Death is\nlooked upon by Christ as sleep\u2014silence, darkness, sleep. He speaks\nof it as if it were of little moment. \u201cWhosoever liveth and believeth [303]\nin me,\u201d He says, \u201cshall never die\u201d (John 11:26). \u201cIf a man keep my\nsaying, he shall never taste of death\u201d (John 8:52). \u201cHe shall never\nsee death\u201d (John 8:51). And to the believing one, death is but a small\nmatter. With him to die is but to sleep. \u201cThem also which sleep in\nJesus will God bring with him\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:14).\nWhile the women were making known their message as wit-\nnesses of the risen Saviour, and while Jesus was preparing to reveal\nHimself to a large number of His followers, another scene was taking\nplace. The Roman guard had been enabled to view the mighty angel\nwho sang the song of triumph at the birth of Christ, and hear the\nangels who now sang the song of redeeming love. At the wonderful\nscene which they were permitted to behold, they had fainted and\nbecome as dead men. When the heavenly train was hidden from\ntheir sight, they arose to their feet, and made their way to the gate\n280 Selected Messages Book 1\nof the garden as quickly as their tottering limbs would carry them.\nStaggering like blind or drunken men, their faces pale as the dead,\nthey told those they met of the wonderful scenes they had witnessed.\nMessengers preceded them quickly to the chief priests and rulers,\ndeclaring, as best they could, the remarkable incidents that had taken\nplace.\nThe guards were making their way first to Pilate, but the priests\nand rulers sent word for them to be brought into their presence.\nThese hardened soldiers presented a strange appearance, as they\nbore testimony to the resurrection of Christ and also of the multitude\nwhom He brought forth with Him. They told the chief priests what\nthey had seen at the sepulcher. They had not time to think or speak\nanything but the truth. But the rulers were displeased with the report.\nThey knew the great publicity had been given to the trial of Christ, by\nholding it at the time of the Passover. They knew that the wonderful\nevents which had taken place\u2014the supernatural darkness, the mighty\nearthquake\u2014could not be without effect, and they at once planned\nhow they might deceive the people. The soldiers were bribed to\nreport a falsehood.\nChapter 45\u2014The First Fruits [304]\nChrist, Creator and Life-giver\n[This article appeared in The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 11, 1898,\nunder the title \u201cThe Risen Saviour\u2014Part 2.\u201d]\nWhen Christ cried out while upon the cross, \u201cIt is finished\u201d (John\n19:30), there was a mighty earthquake, that rent open the graves\nof many who had been faithful and loyal, bearing their testimony\nagainst every evil work, and magnifying the Lord of hosts. As\nthe Life-giver came forth from the sepulcher, proclaiming, \u201cI am\nthe resurrection, and the life\u201d (John 11:25), He summoned these\nsaints from the grave. When alive, they had borne their testimony\nunflinchingly for the truth; now, they were to be witnesses to Him\nwho had raised them from the dead. These, said Christ, are no longer\nthe captives of Satan. I have redeemed them; I have brought them\nfrom the grave as the first fruits of My power, to be with Me where I\nam, nevermore to see death or experience sorrow.\nDuring His ministry, Jesus raised the dead to life. He raised the\nson of the widow of Nain, the daughter of Jairus, and Lazarus; but\nthese were not clothed with immortality. After they were raised, they\ncontinued to be subject to death. But those who came forth from the\ngrave at Christ\u2019s resurrection were raised to everlasting life. They [305]\nwere the multitude of captives that ascended with Him as trophies\nof His victory over death and the grave.\nAfter His resurrection, Christ did not show Himself to any save\nHis followers; but testimony in regard to His resurrection was not\nwanting. Those who were raised with Christ \u201cappeared unto many\u201d\n(Matthew 27:53), declaring, Christ has risen from the dead, and we\nare risen with Him. They bore testimony in the city to the fulfillment\nof the scripture, \u201cThy dead men shall live, together with my dead\nbody shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy\ndew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead\u201d\n281\n282 Selected Messages Book 1\n(Isaiah 26:19). These saints contradicted the lie which the Roman\nguard had been hired to circulate\u2014that the disciples had come by\nnight and stolen Him away. This testimony could not be silenced.\nChrist was the first fruits of them that slept. It was to the glory of\nGod that the Prince of life should be the first fruits, the antitype of the\nwave sheaf. \u201cFor whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate\nto be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the\nfirstborn among many brethren\u201d (Romans 8:29). This very scene,\nthe resurrection of Christ from the dead, had been celebrated in type\nby the Jews. When the first heads of grain ripened in the field, they\nwere carefully gathered; and when the people went up to Jerusalem,\nthese were presented to the Lord as a thank offering. The people\nwaved the ripened sheaf before God, acknowledging Him as the\nLord of the harvest. After this ceremony the sickle could be put to\nthe wheat, and the harvest gathered.\nSo those who had been raised were to be presented to the universe\nas a pledge of the resurrection of all who believe in Christ as their\npersonal Saviour. The same power that raised Christ from the dead\nwill raise His church, and glorify it with Christ, as His bride, above\nall principalities, above all powers, above every name that is named,\nnot only in this world, but also in the heavenly courts, the world\nabove. The victory of the sleeping saints will be glorious on the\nmorning of the resurrection. Satan\u2019s triumph will end, while Christ[306]\nwill triumph in glory and honor. The Life-giver will crown with\nimmortality all who come forth from the grave.\nThe Ascension of Christ\nThe work of the Saviour on earth was finished. The time had\ncome for Him to return to His heavenly home. \u201cAnd he led them\n[the disciples] out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands,\nand blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he\nwas parted from them, and carried up into heaven\u201d (Luke 24:50, 51).\nAs Christ ascends while in the act of blessing His disciples, an\narmy of angels encircle Him as a cloud. Christ takes with Him the\nmultitude of captives. He will Himself bring to the Father the first\nfruits of them that slept, as an evidence that He is conqueror of death\nand the grave. At the portals of the city of God, an innumerable com-\nFirst Fruits 283\npany of angels await His coming. As they approach, the escorting\nangels address the company at the gate in triumphant tones:\u2014\n\u201cLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nAnd be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\n\u201cWho is this King of glory?\u201d the waiting angels inquire.\n\u201cThe Lord strong and mighty,\nThe Lord mighty in battle.\nLift up your heads, O ye gates;\nEven lift them up, ye everlasting doors;\nAnd the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nAgain the waiting angels ask, \u201cWho is this King of glory?\u201d and\nthe escorting angels reply, in melodious strains, \u201cThe Lord of hosts,\nhe is the King of glory\u201d (Psalm 24:7-10). Then the portals of the\ncity of God are opened wide, and the angelic throng sweep through.\nThere is the throne, and around it the rainbow of promise. There\nare seraphim and cherubim. The angels circle round Him, but Christ\nwaves them back. He enters into the presence of His Father. He [307]\npoints to His triumph in this antitype of Himself\u2014the wave sheaf\u2014\nthose raised with Him, the representatives of the captive dead who\nshall come forth from their graves when the trump shall sound. He\napproaches the Father, and if there is joy in heaven over one sinner\nthat repents, if the Father rejoices over one with singing, let the\nimagination take in this scene. Christ says: Father, it is finished.\nI have done Thy will, O My God. I have completed the work of\nredemption. If Thy justice is satisfied, \u201cI will that they also, whom\nthou hast given me, be with me where I am\u201d (John 17:24). And\nthe voice of God is heard; justice is satisfied; Satan is vanquished.\n\u201cMercy and truth have met together; righteousness and peace have\nkissed each other\u201d (Psalm 85:10). The arms of the Father encircle\nthe Son, and His voice is heard, saying, \u201cLet all the angels of God\nworship him\u201d (Hebrews 1:6).\nChapter 46\u2014A Divine Sin Bearer[308]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, September 30,\n1903.]\nThrough disobedience Adam fell. The law of God had been\nbroken. The divine government had been dishonored, and justice\ndemanded that the penalty of transgression be paid.\nTo save the race from eternal death, the Son of God volunteered\nto bear the punishment of disobedience. Only by the humiliation\nof the Prince of heaven could the dishonor be removed, justice be\nsatisfied, and man be restored to that which he had forfeited by\ndisobedience. There was no other way. For an angel to come to this\nearth, to pass over the ground where Adam stumbled and fell, would\nnot have sufficed. This could not have removed one stain of sin, or\nbrought to man one hour of probation.\nChrist, equal with God, the brightness of the Father\u2019s \u201cglory,\nand the express image of his person\u201d (Hebrews 1:3), clothed His\ndivinity with humanity, and came to this earth to suffer and die\nfor sinners. The only-begotten Son of God humbled Himself, and\nbecame obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. By bearing\nin His body the curse of sin, He placed happiness and immortality\nwithin the reach of all.\nOne honored of all heaven came to this world to stand in human[309]\nnature at the head of humanity, testifying to the fallen angels and\nto the inhabitants of the unfallen worlds that through the divine\nhelp which has been provided, every one may walk in the path of\nobedience to God\u2019s commands. The Son of God died for those who\nhad no claim on His love. For us He suffered all that Satan could\nbring against Him.\nWonderful\u2014almost too wonderful for man to comprehend\u2014\nis the Saviour\u2019s sacrifice in our behalf, shadowed forth in all the\n284\nDivine Sin Bearer 285\nsacrifices of the past, in all the services of the typical sanctuary. And\nthis sacrifice was called for. When we realize that His suffering was\nnecessary in order to secure our eternal well-being, our hearts are\ntouched and melted. He pledged Himself to accomplish our full\nsalvation in a way satisfactory to the demands of God\u2019s justice, and\nconsistent with the exalted holiness of His law.\nNo one less holy than the Only Begotten of the Father, could\nhave offered a sacrifice that would be efficacious to cleanse all\u2014\neven the most sinful and degraded\u2014who accept the Saviour as their\natonement and become obedient to Heaven\u2019s law. Nothing less could\nhave reinstated man in God\u2019s favor.\nWhat right had Christ to take the captives out of the enemy\u2019s\nhands?\u2014The right of having made a sacrifice that satisfies the prin-\nciples of justice by which the kingdom of heaven is governed. He\ncame to this earth as the Redeemer of the lost race, to conquer the\nwily foe, and, by His steadfast allegiance to right, to save all who\naccept Him as their Saviour. On the cross of Calvary He paid the\nredemption price of the race. And thus He gained the right to take\nthe captives from the grasp of the great deceiver, who, by a lie,\nframed against the government of God, caused the fall of man, and\nthus forfeited all claim to be called a loyal subject of God\u2019s glorious\neverlasting kingdom.\nOur ransom has been paid by our Saviour. No one need be\nenslaved by Satan. Christ stands before us as our all-powerful helper.\n\u201cIn all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that [310]\nhe might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining\nto God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that\nhe himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them\nthat are tempted\u201d (Hebrews 2:17, 18).\n\u201cHe came unto his own, and his own received him not. But as\nmany as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons\nof God, even to them that believe on his name.... And the Word\nwas made flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace and truth....\nAnd of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace\u201d (John\n1:11-16).\nThose who are adopted into the family of God are transformed by\nHis Spirit. Self-indulgence and supreme love for self are changed for\nself-denial and supreme love for God. No man inherits holiness as a\n286 Selected Messages Book 1\nbirthright, nor can he, by any methods that he can devise, become\nloyal to God. \u201cWithout me,\u201d Christ says, \u201cye can do nothing\u201d (John\n15:5). Human righteousness is as \u201cfilthy rags.\u201d But with God all\nthings are possible. In the strength of the Redeemer, weak, erring\nman can become more than conqueror over the evil that besets him.\nChapter 47\u2014The Truth as It Is in Jesus [311]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, June 17, 1890.]\nIn giving His only-begotten Son to die for sinners, God has\nmanifested to fallen man love that is without a parallel. We have\nfull faith in the scripture that says, \u201cGod is love\u201d (1 John 4:8); and\nyet many have shamefully perverted this word, and have fallen into\ndangerous error because of a false interpretation of its meaning.\nGod\u2019s holy law is the only standard by which we can estimate divine\naffection. If we do not accept the law of God as our standard, we set\nup a standard of our own. God has given us precious promises of\nHis love, but we are not to ascribe to Jehovah a tenderness that will\nlead Him to pass over guilt and wink at iniquity.\nThe Creator loves His creatures, but he who loves sin more than\nrighteousness, error more than truth, perpetuates the transgression\nthat brought woe into our world, and cannot be regarded with favor\nby the God of truth. The way of truth and righteousness involves\na cross. Many misinterpret the requirements of God, and make\nthem mean anything that will not disturb their consciences or in-\nconvenience them in their business relations; but truth is the only\nsanctifying medium.\nThe love of God as manifested in Jesus, will lead us to the true [312]\nconception of the character of God. As we behold Christ, pierced\nfor our sins, we shall see that we cannot break the law of God and\nremain in His favor; we shall feel that as sinners we must lay hold\nof the merits of Christ and cease to sin. Then we are drawing nigh\nto God. As soon as we have a correct view of the love of God, we\nshall have no disposition to abuse it.\nThe cross of Christ testifies to the immutability of the law of\nGod\u2014testifies that God so loved us that He gave His Son to die for\nour sins; but Christ came not to destroy but to fulfill the law. Not\n287\n288 Selected Messages Book 1\none jot or tittle of God\u2019s moral standard could be changed to meet\nman in his fallen condition. Jesus died that He might ascribe unto\nthe repenting sinner His own righteousness, and make it possible for\nman to keep the law.\nThe love of God is infinite, and yet the sinner could not be for-\ngiven save through the plan of redemption that involved the shame,\nreproach, ignominy, and death of the Son of God. This fact should\nbanish from reasoning minds the idea advanced by many who claim\nsanctification, that His death put an end to obedience to the law of\nGod. We are to learn daily of the great plan of redemption, in the\nschool of Christ. When we cease to learn, we cease to be pupils in\nChrist\u2019s school. But if we are scholars under the divine Master, our\nunderstanding will be opened, and we shall learn wondrous things\nout of God\u2019s law.\nLet us walk carefully before the Lord; let us think how often we\nhave broken our vows and marred our best resolutions, how often in\nthe face of great light we have turned from God and sought our idols.\nIt is highly proper for us to humble ourselves under the mighty hand\nof God.\nMature in Christian Experience\nIt is natural for us to think more highly of ourselves than we\nought to think; but although it is painful for us to know ourselves as\nwe really are, yet we should pray that God will reveal us to ourselves,\neven as He sees us. But we should not cease to pray when we have\nsimply asked for a revelation of ourselves; we should pray that Jesus[313]\nmay be revealed to us as a sin-pardoning Saviour. When we see\nJesus as He is, earnest desires should awaken in our hearts to be rid\nof self, that we may be filled with all the fullness of Christ. When\nthis is our experience, we shall do good to one another, and use\nall the means within our reach to attain unto godliness. We must\ncleanse our souls from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and perfect\nholiness in the fear of God.\nThe love of a holy God is an amazing principle, which can\nstir the universe in our behalf during the hours of our probation\nand trial. But after the season of our probation, if we are found\ntransgressors of God\u2019s law, the God of love will be found a minister\nTruth as It Is in Jesus 289\nof vengeance. God makes no compromise with sin. The disobedient\nwill be punished. The wrath of God fell upon His beloved Son as\nChrist hung upon the cross of Calvary in the transgressor\u2019s place.\nThe love of God now reaches out to embrace the lowest, vilest sinner\nthat will come to Christ with contrition. It reaches out to transform\nthe sinner into an obedient, faithful child of God; but not a soul can\nbe saved if he continues in sin.\nSin is the transgression of the law, and the arm that is now mighty\nto save will be strong to punish when the transgressor passes the\nbounds that limit divine forbearance. He who refuses to seek for\nlife, who will not search the Scriptures to see what is truth, lest he\nshould be condemned in his practices, will be left to blindness of\nmind and to the deceptions of Satan. To the same degree that the\npenitent and obedient are shielded by God\u2019s love, the impenitent\nand disobedient will be left to the result of their own ignorance and\nhardness of heart, because they receive not the love of the truth that\nthey may be saved.\nThere are many who profess Christ, but who never become\nmature Christians. They admit that man is fallen, that his faculties\nare weakened, that he is unfitted for moral achievement, but they\nsay that Christ has borne all the burden, all the suffering, all the\nself-denial, and they are willing to let Him bear it. They say that\nthere is nothing for them to do but to believe; but Christ said, \u201cIf any [314]\nman will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross,\nand follow me\u201d (Matthew 16:24). Jesus kept the commandments of\nGod. The Pharisees declared that He broke the fourth commandment\nbecause He made a man every whit whole on the Sabbath day; but\nJesus turned to the accusing Pharisees, and asked, \u201cIs it lawful\non the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to\ndestroy it? And looking round about upon them all, he said unto\nthe man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was\nrestored whole as the other. And they were filled with madness; and\ncommuned one with another what they might do to Jesus\u201d (Luke\n6:9-11).\nThis miracle, instead of convincing the Pharisees that Jesus was\nthe Son of God, filled them with rage, because many who witnessed\nthe miracle glorified God. Jesus declared that His work of mercy\nwas lawful on the Sabbath day. The Pharisees declared that it was\n290 Selected Messages Book 1\nnot lawful. Which shall we believe? Christ said, \u201cI have kept my\nFather\u2019s commandments, and abide in his love\u201d (John 15:10). Then\nit is certainly safe for us to follow the way of Christ, and keep\nthe commandments. God has given us faculties which should be\nconstantly exercised in cooperating with Jesus, in working out our\nown salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in\nus to will and to do of His good pleasure.\nAdvancement Not to Cease\nWe are never to rest in a satisfied condition, and cease to make\nadvancement, saying, \u201cI am saved.\u201d When this idea is entertained,\nthe motives for watchfulness, for prayers, for earnest endeavor to\npress onward to higher attainments, cease to exist. No sanctified\ntongue will be found uttering these words till Christ shall come,\nand we enter in through the gates into the city of God. Then, with\nthe utmost propriety, we may give glory to God and to the Lamb\nfor eternal deliverance. As long as man is full of weakness\u2014for of\nhimself he cannot save his soul\u2014he should never dare to say, \u201cI am\nsaved.\u201d\nIt is not he that putteth on the armor that can boast of the victory;[315]\nfor he has the battle to fight and victory to win. It is he that endureth\nunto the end that shall be saved. The Lord says, \u201cIf any man draw\nback, my soul shall have no pleasure in him\u201d (Hebrews 10:38). If we\ndo not go forward from victory to victory, the soul will draw back to\nperdition. We should raise no human standard whereby to measure\ncharacter. We have seen enough of what men call perfection here\nbelow. God\u2019s holy law is the only thing by which we can determine\nwhether we are keeping His way or not. If we are disobedient, our\ncharacters are out of harmony with God\u2019s moral rule of government,\nand it is stating a falsehood to say, \u201cI am saved.\u201d No one is saved\nwho is a transgressor of the law of God, which is the foundation of\nHis government in heaven and in earth.\nThose who ignorantly join the ranks of the enemy, and echo the\nwords of their religious teachers, in the desk, that the law of God is\nno longer binding upon the human family, will have light to discover\ntheir errors, if they will accept the evidence of God\u2019s Word. Jesus\nwas the angel enshrouded in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar\nTruth as It Is in Jesus 291\nof fire by night, and He gave special direction that the Hebrews\nshould teach the law of God, given when the foundation of the earth\nwas laid, when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of\nGod shouted for joy.\nThe same law was proclaimed in grandeur by His own voice from\nSinai. He said: \u201cAnd these words, which I command thee this day,\nshall be in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy\nchildren, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and\nwhen thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when\nthou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand,\nand they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes\u201d (Deuteronomy\n6:6-8). How impatient the transgressors of God\u2019s law become when\nthe law is mentioned; they are irritated to have it spoken of.\nThe Word of God is made of none effect by falsehoods and\ntraditions. Satan has presented his version of God\u2019s law to the world,\nand it has been accepted before a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d The [316]\ncontroversy begun in heaven over the law of God, has been kept up\nupon the earth ever since Satan\u2019s expulsion from heaven.\nWe must ever be learning our great need, in order to appreciate\nour Saviour, and to make Him known to others. We can learn the\ndepths of our transgression only by the length of the chain let down\nto draw us up. We should put our mental powers to the task to\nunderstand the fearful ruin to which sin has brought us, and we\nshould seek to understand the divine plan by which we may be\nrestored to the favor of God. That God\u2019s dear Son should have to\ncome to our world to fight our battles for us that we might have\nstrength to conquer in His name, should ever humble our proud\nhearts. If we look to the cross of Calvary, every boast will die upon\nour lips, and we shall cry, \u201cUnclean, unworthy of so great suffering,\nof so rich a price paid for my redemption.\u201d\nIgnorance and self-sufficiency go hand in hand. The law of God\nhas been given for the regulation of our conduct, and it is far reaching\nin its principles. There is no sin, no work of unrighteousness, that\nescapes the condemnation of the law. The great statute book is truth,\nand truth only; for it delineates with unerring accuracy the history\nof Satan\u2019s deception, and the ruin of his followers. Satan claimed to\nbe able to present laws which were better than God\u2019s statutes and\njudgments, and he was expelled from heaven. He has made a similar\n292 Selected Messages Book 1\nattempt upon earth. Ever since his fall he has put forth efforts to\ndeceive the world, to lead men to ruin, that he might be revenged\nupon God because he was overcome and thrust down from heaven.\nHis efforts to put himself and his devices where God should be, are\nmost persevering and persistent. He has taken the world captive in\nhis snare, and many even of the people of God are ignorant of his\ndevices, and they give him all the opportunity he asks to work the\nruin of souls. They do not manifest a burning zeal to lift up Jesus,\nand proclaim to the perishing multitudes, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29).\nThose who are unacquainted with the laws of God\u2019s government[317]\nas expounded upon the mount, are unacquainted with the truth as it\nis in Jesus. Christ revealed the far-reaching principles of the law;\nHe expounded every precept, and exhibited every demand in His\nexample. He that knows the truth as it is in the law, knows the truth\nas it is in Jesus; and if through faith in Christ he renders obedience\nto the commandments of God, his life is hid with Christ in God.\nThe knowledge of the claims of the law would crush out the last\nray of hope from the soul if there were no Saviour provided for man;\nbut the truth as it is in Jesus, is a savor of life unto life. God\u2019s dear\nSon died that He might impute unto man His own righteousness,\nand not that he might be at liberty to break God\u2019s holy law, as Satan\ntries to make men believe. Through faith in Christ, man may be in\npossession of moral power to resist evil.\nSanctification the Work of a Lifetime\nThe work of sanctification is the work of a lifetime; it must go\non continually; but this work cannot go on in the heart while the\nlight on any part of the truth is rejected or neglected. The sanctified\nsoul will not be content to remain in ignorance, but will desire to\nwalk in the light and to seek for greater light. As a miner digs for\ngold and silver, so the follower of Christ will seek for truth as for\nhidden treasures, and will press from light to a greater light, ever\nincreasing in knowledge. He will continually grow in grace and in\nthe knowledge of the truth. Self must be overcome. Every defect of\ncharacter must be discerned in God\u2019s great mirror. We may discover\nwhether or not we are condemned by God\u2019s standard of character.\nTruth as It Is in Jesus 293\nIf you are condemned, there is but one course for you to pursue:\nyou must repent toward God because of the transgression of His\nlaw, and have faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ as the one who\nonly can cleanse from sin. If we would obtain heaven, we must be\nobedient to God\u2019s holy requirements. Those who strive lawfully will\nnot strive in vain. Only believe the truth as it is in Jesus, and you\nwill be strengthened for the battle with the powers of darkness. The [318]\nwrestlers of old strove to obtain a perishable crown, and should we\nnot strive to win the crown that fadeth not away?\nEvery art and device of Satan will be used to accomplish our\nruin. If you sit down with the ease-loving ones, with the words on\nyour lips, \u201cI am saved,\u201d and disregard the commandments of God,\nyou will be eternally lost. There is truth in Jesus that is terrible to\nthe ease-loving, do-nothing ones. There is truth in Jesus that is full\nof soothing joy to the obedient. It is the joy of the Holy Ghost. Be\npersuaded, then, to open the mind and heart, that you may see every\nray of light shining from the throne of God.\nThis is no time to be indifferent and careless and pleasure loving.\nChrist is coming with power and great glory. Are you ready? Are\nyou putting away your sins? Are you becoming sanctified through\nthe truth in answer to the prayer of Christ? He prayed concerning\nHis disciples, \u201cSanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth\u201d\n(John 17:17).\nParents should bring up their children in the nurture and admo-\nnition of the Lord, educating them to love to do the will of God.\nIt is impossible for us to overestimate the advantages of youthful\npiety. The impressions received in youth are to many as enduring as\neternity. It is in youth that the statutes and commandments of God\nare most easily inscribed on the tablets of the soul. The instruction\nof children has been greatly neglected; the righteousness of Christ\nhas not been presented to them as it should have been.\nThe time of probation is given us that we may perfect a char-\nacter fit for eternity. How solemn is the thought, parents, that your\nchildren are in your hands to educate and train that they may de-\nvelop characters which God will approve, or characters which Satan\nand his angels can play upon as they choose! Jesus spoke from\nthe pillar of cloud and of fire, and bade His people instruct their\nchildren diligently concerning the commandments of God. Who are\n294 Selected Messages Book 1\nobeying this instruction? Who are seeking to make their children[319]\nsuch as God will approve? Who keep the thought in mind that all\nthe talents and gifts of their children belong to God, and should be\nwholly consecrated to His service?\nHannah dedicated Samuel to the Lord, and God revealed Himself\nto Him in his childhood and youth. We must labor far more for our\nchildren and for the youth; for God will accept them to do great\nthings in His name in teaching the truth to those in foreign lands, to\nthose who are in the darkness of error and superstition. If you indulge\nyour children, gratifying their selfish wishes; if you encourage in\nthem the love of dress, and develop vanity and pride, you will do a\nwork that will disappoint Jesus, who has paid an infinite price for\ntheir redemption. He desires that the children shall serve Him with\nundivided affection.\nParents, there is a great work for you to do for Jesus, who has\ndone everything for you. Take Him as your guide and helper. God\nhas not withheld from you the very best gift He had to give\u2014His\nonly-begotten Son. Children and youth should not be hindered in\ncoming to Jesus. Satan seeks to bind the children to himself as with\nbands of steel, and you can attain success in bringing them to Jesus\nonly through determined personal effort. Children and youth should\nreceive more earnest labor, for they are the hope of the church.\nJoseph, Daniel and his fellows, Samuel, David, John, and Timothy\nare shining examples that testify to the fact that \u201cthe fear of the Lord\nis the beginning of wisdom\u201d (Proverbs 9:10).\nWe must make more earnest, decided efforts, if we would have\nthe Lord Jesus abide with us as a counselor and helper. The light\nthat shines from the Son of God on Calvary can lead every wanderer\nhome. There is power in Him to purify the heart and transform the\ncharacter. Let every true Christian work for the children and youth,\npresenting before them the matchless loveliness of Jesus. Then the\nattractions and the illusions of the world will be eclipsed, and they\nwill see no advantage to be gained in the path of disobedience.\nChapter 48\u2014The Divine Standard [320]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, December 5,\n1892.]\nThe commandments of God are comprehensive and far reaching;\nin a few words they unfold the whole duty of man. \u201cThou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind, and with all thy strength.... Thou shalt love thy neigh-\nbour as thyself\u201d (Mark 12:30, 31). In these words the length and\nbreadth, the depth and height, of the law of God is comprehended;\nfor Paul declares, \u201cLove is the fulfilling of the law\u201d (Romans 13:10).\nThe only definition we find in the Bible for sin is that \u201csin is the\ntransgression of the law\u201d (1 John 3:4). The Word of God declares,\n\u201cAll have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\u201d (Romans\n3:23). \u201cThere is none that doeth good, no, not one\u201d (Romans 3:12).\nMany are deceived concerning the condition of their hearts. They\ndo not realize that the natural heart is deceitful above all things,\nand desperately wicked. They wrap themselves about with their\nown righteousness, and are satisfied in reaching their own human\nstandard of character; but how fatally they fail when they do not\nreach the divine standard, and of themselves they cannot meet the\nrequirements of God.\nWe may measure ourselves by ourselves, we may compare our- [321]\nselves among ourselves, we may say we do as well as this one or that\none, but the question to which the judgment will call for an answer\nis, Do we meet the claims of high heaven? Do we reach the divine\nstandard? Are our hearts in harmony with the God of heaven?\nThe human family have all transgressed the law of God, and\nas transgressors of the law, man is hopelessly ruined; for he is\nthe enemy of God, without strength to do any good thing. \u201cThe\ncarnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law\n295\n296 Selected Messages Book 1\nof God, neither indeed can be\u201d (Romans 8:7). Looking into the\nmoral mirror\u2014God\u2019s holy law\u2014man sees himself a sinner, and is\nconvicted of his state of evil, his hopeless doom under the just penalty\nof the law. But he has not been left in a state of hopeless distress in\nwhich sin has plunged him; for it was to save the transgressor from\nruin that He who was equal with God offered up His life on Calvary.\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife\u201d (John 3:16).\nOur Atoning Sacrifice\nJesus was the majesty of heaven, the beloved commander of the\nangels, who delighted to do His pleasure. He was one with God, \u201cin\nthe bosom of the Father\u201d (John 1:18), yet He thought it not a thing\nto be desired to be equal with God while man was lost in sin and\nmisery. He stepped down from His throne, He left His crown and\nroyal scepter, and clothed His divinity with humanity. He humbled\nHimself even to the death of the cross, that man might be exalted\nto a seat with Him upon His throne. In Him we have a complete\noffering, an infinite sacrifice, a mighty Saviour, who is able to save\nunto the uttermost all that come unto God by Him. In love He comes\nto reveal the Father, to reconcile man to God, to make him a new\ncreature renewed after the image of Him who created him.\nJesus is our atoning sacrifice. We can make no atonement for\nourselves; but by faith we can accept the atonement that has been[322]\nmade. \u201cFor Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the\nunjust, that he might bring us to God\u201d (1 Peter 3:18). \u201cYe were not\nredeemed with corruptible things, ... but with the precious blood of\nChrist, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot\u201d (1 Peter 1:18,\n19). It was through infinite sacrifice and inexpressible suffering\nthat our Redeemer placed redemption within our reach. He was in\nthis world unhonored and unknown, that, through His wonderful\ncondescension and humiliation, He might exalt man to receive eter-\nnal honors and immortal joys in the heavenly courts. During His\nthirty years of life on earth His heart was wrung with inconceivable\nanguish. The path from the manger to Calvary was shadowed by\ngrief and sorrow. He was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with\nDivine Standard 297\ngrief, enduring such heartache as no human language can portray.\nHe could have said in truth, \u201cBehold, and see if there be any sor-\nrow like unto my sorrow\u201d (Lamentations 1:12). Hating sin with a\nperfect hatred, He yet gathered to His soul the sins of the whole\nworld. Guiltless, He bore the punishment of the guilty. Innocent,\nyet offering Himself as a substitute for the transgressor. The guilt\nof every sin pressed its weight upon the divine soul of the world\u2019s\nRedeemer. The evil thoughts, the evil words, the evil deeds of every\nson and daughter of Adam, called for retribution upon Himself; for\nHe had become man\u2019s substitute. Though the guilt of sin was not\nHis, His spirit was torn and bruised by the transgressions of men,\nand He who knew no sin became sin for us, that we might be made\nthe righteousness of God in Him.\nV oluntarily our divine Substitute bared His soul to the sword\nof justice, that we might not perish but have everlasting life. Said\nChrist, \u201cI lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh\nit from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down,\nand I have power to take it again\u201d (John 10:17, 18). No man of\nearth or angel of heaven could have paid the penalty for sin. Jesus\nwas the only one who could save rebellious man. In Him divinity\nand humanity were combined, and this was what gave efficiency to\nthe offering on Calvary\u2019s cross. At the cross mercy and truth met [323]\ntogether, righteousness and peace kissed each other.\nAs the sinner looks upon the Saviour dying on Calvary, and\nrealizes that the sufferer is divine, he asks why this great sacrifice\nwas made, and the cross points to the holy law of God which has\nbeen transgressed. The death of Christ is an unanswerable argument\nas to the immutability and righteousness of the law. In prophesy-\ning of Christ, Isaiah says, \u201cHe will magnify the law, and make it\nhonourable\u201d (Isaiah 42:21). The law has no power to pardon the\nevildoer. Its office is to point out his defects, that he may realize his\nneed of One who is mighty to save, his need of One who will become\nhis substitute, his surety, his righteousness. Jesus meets the need of\nthe sinner; for He has taken upon Him the sins of the transgressor.\n\u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our\niniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with\nhis stripes we are healed\u201d (Isaiah 53:5). The Lord could have cut\noff the sinner, and utterly destroyed him; but the costlier plan was\n298 Selected Messages Book 1\nchosen. In His great love He provides hope for the hopeless, giving\nHis only-begotten Son to bear the sins of the world. And since He\nhas poured out all heaven in that one rich gift, He will withhold\nfrom man no needed aid that he may take the cup of salvation, and\nbecome an heir of God, joint heir with Christ.\nA Revelation of God\u2019s Love\nChrist came to manifest the love of God to the world, to draw\nthe hearts of all men to Himself. He said, \u201cAnd I, if I be lifted\nup from the earth, will draw all men unto me\u201d (John 12:32). The\nfirst step toward salvation is to respond to the drawing of the love\nof Christ. God sends message after message to men, entreating\nthem to repentance, that He may forgive, and write pardon against\ntheir names. Shall there be no repentance? Shall His appeals be\nunheeded? Shall His overtures of mercy be ignored, and His love\nutterly rejected? Oh, then man will cut himself off from the medium\nthrough which he may gain life eternal; for God only pardons the[324]\npenitent! By the manifestation of His love, by the entreating of His\nSpirit, He woos men to repentance; for repentance is the gift of God,\nand whom He pardons He first makes penitent. The sweetest joy\ncomes to man through his sincere repentance toward God for the\ntransgression of His law, and through faith in Christ as the sinner\u2019s\nRedeemer and Advocate. It is that men may understand the joy of\nforgiveness, the peace of God, that Christ draws them through the\nmanifestation of His love. If they respond to His drawing, yielding\ntheir hearts to His grace, He will lead them on step by step, to a full\nknowledge of Himself, and this is life eternal.\nChrist came to reveal to the sinner the justice and love of God,\nthat He might give repentance to Israel and remission of sins. When\nthe sinner beholds Jesus lifted up upon the cross, suffering the guilt\nof the transgressor, bearing the penalty of sin; when he beholds\nGod\u2019s abhorrence of evil in the fearful manifestation of the death of\nthe cross, and His love for fallen man, he is led to repentance toward\nGod because of his transgression of the law which is holy, and just,\nand good. He exercises faith in Christ, because the divine Saviour\nhas become his substitute, his surety, and advocate, the one in whom\nDivine Standard 299\nhis very life is centered. To the repenting sinner God can show His\nmercy and truth, and bestow upon him His forgiveness and love.\nBut Satan will not permit a soul to escape from the captivity of\nsin if by any means he can prevent it. Though all heaven has been\npoured out in one rich gift\u2014for when God gave His Son, He gave\nthe choicest gift of heaven, and the treasures of heaven are at our\ncommand\u2014yet to the repenting soul the enemy will seek to represent\nGod as stern and inexorable, unwilling to pardon the transgressor.\nAt different times letters have come to me from persons who were\nin despair over their sins. One and another have written: \u201cI fear I\nam past all help. Is there any hope for me?\u201d To these poor souls\nthe message has been given: \u201cHope in God. The Father has bread\nenough and to spare. Arise, and go to your Father. He will meet you [325]\na great way off. He will give you His love and compassion.\u201d\nWhen the enemy comes in like a flood, and seeks to overwhelm\nyou with the thought of your sin, tell him: \u201cI know I am a sinner. If\nI were not, I could not go to the Saviour; for He says, \u2018I came not\nto call the righteous, but sinners to repentance\u2019 (Mark 2:17). And\nbecause I am a sinner I am entitled to come to Christ. I am sinful\nand polluted, but He suffered humiliation and death, and exhausted\nthe curse that belongs to me. I come. I believe. I claim His sure\npromise, \u201cWhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life\u2019 (John 3:16).\u201d\nWill such a plea made in contrition of soul be turned away?\u2014No,\nnever. By the suffering and death of Christ is proven His boundless\nlove to man. He is willing and able to save to the uttermost all that\ncome unto God by Him.\nThen as a little child, come to God, presenting yourself as sup-\npliant at His feet; for we need not ascend into the heavens to bring\nJesus down; nor into the earth to bring Him up; for He is ever near\nus. He says, \u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man\nhear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup\nwith him, and he with me\u201d (Revelation 3:20). How willing is Christ\nto take possession of the soul temple if we will let Him! He is repre-\nsented as waiting and knocking at the door of the heart. Then why\ndoes He not enter? It is because the love of sin has closed the door\nof the heart. As soon as we consent to give sin up, to acknowledge\nour guilt, the barrier is removed between the soul and the Saviour.\nChapter 49\u2014Surrender and Confession[326]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, December 12,\n1892.]\nBut in repenting of sin we need not go into a cell, as did Luther,\nimposing penances upon ourselves to expiate our iniquity, thinking\nby so doing to gain the favor of God. The question is asked: \u201cShall\nI give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for\nthe sin of my soul? He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good;\nand what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love\nmercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\u201d (Micah 6:7, 8). The\npsalmist says, \u201cA broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not\ndespise\u201d (Psalm 51:17). John writes, \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is\nfaithful and just to forgive us our sins\u201d (1 John 1:9). The only reason\nthat we have not remission of sin is that we have not acknowledged\nto Him whom we have wounded by our transgressions, whom we\nhave pierced by our sins, that we are at fault, and in need of mercy.\nThe confession that is the outpouring of the inmost soul will find its\nway to the heart of infinite pity; for the Lord is nigh unto him that is\nof a broken heart, and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.\nHow mistaken are those who imagine that confession of sin will\ndetract from their dignity, and lessen their influence among their[327]\nfellow men. Clinging to this erroneous idea, though seeing their\nfaults, many fail to confess them, but rather pass by the wrongs they\nhave done others, so embittering their own lives, and shadowing the\nlives of others. It will not hurt your dignity to confess your sins.\nAway with this false dignity. Fall on the Rock and be broken, and\nChrist will give you the true and heavenly dignity. Let not pride, self-\nesteem, or self-righteousness keep anyone from confessing his sin,\nthat he may claim the promise. \u201cHe that covereth his sins shall not\nprosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy\u201d\n300\nSurrender and Confession 301\n(Proverbs 28:13). Keep nothing back from God, and neglect not the\nconfession of your faults to your brethren. \u201cConfess your faults one\nto another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed\u201d (James\n5:16). Many a sin is left unconfessed to confront the sinner in the day\nof final account; better far to confront your sins now, to confess them\nand put them away, while the atoning Sacrifice pleads in your behalf.\nDo not fail to learn the will of God on this subject. The health of your\nsoul and the salvation of others depends upon the course you pursue\nin this matter. \u201cHumble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand\nof God, that he may exalt you in due time: casting all your care upon\nhim: for he careth for you\u201d (1 Peter 5:6, 7). The humble and broken\nheart can appreciate something of the love of God and the cross of\nCalvary. Ample will be the blessing experienced by him who meets\nthe condition by which he may become a partaker of the favor of\nGod.\nCall for Surrender\nWe are to surrender our hearts to God, that He may renew and\nsanctify us, and fit us for His heavenly court. We are not to wait\nfor some special time, but today we are to give ourselves to Him,\nrefusing to be the servants of sin. Do you imagine you can leave off\nsin a little at a time? Oh, leave the accursed thing at once! Hate the\nthings that Christ hates, love the things that Christ loves. Has He not\nby His death and suffering made provision for your cleansing from\nsin? When we begin to realize that we are sinners, and fall on the [328]\nRock to be broken, the everlasting arms are placed about us, and we\nare brought close to the heart of Jesus. Then we shall be charmed\nwith His loveliness, and disgusted with our own righteousness. We\nneed to come close to the foot of the cross. The more we humble\nourselves there, the more exalted will God\u2019s love appear. The grace\nand righteousness of Christ will not avail for him who feels whole,\nfor him who thinks he is reasonably good, who is contented with his\nown condition. There is no room for Christ in the heart of him who\ndoes not realize his need of divine light and aid.\nJesus says, \u201cBlessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the king-\ndom of heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:3). There is fullness of grace in God,\nand we may have His spirit and power in large measure. Do not feed\n302 Selected Messages Book 1\non the husks of self-righteousness, but go to the Lord. He has the\nbest robe to put upon you, and His arms are open to receive. Christ\nwill say, \u201cTake away the filthy garments from him, and clothe him\nwith a change of raiment.\u201d\nCome as a Repentant Sinner\nBut shall we wait till we feel that we are cleansed?\u2014No; Christ\nhas promised that \u201cif we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to\nforgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1\nJohn 1:9). You are proved of God through the Word of God. You\nare not to wait for wonderful emotions before you believe that God\nhas heard you, feeling is not to be your criterion, for emotions are\nas changeable as the clouds. You must have something solid for the\nfoundation of your faith. The word of the Lord is a word of infinite\npower, upon which you may rely, and He has said, \u201cAsk, and ye\nshall receive.\u201d Look to Calvary. Has not Jesus said that He is your\nadvocate? Has He not said that if you ask anything in His name you\nshall receive? You are not to depend on your own goodness or good\nworks. You are to come depending upon the Sun of Righteousness,\nbelieving that Christ has taken away your sins and imputed to you\nHis righteousness.\nYou are to come to God as a repenting sinner, through the name[329]\nof Jesus, the divine Advocate, to a merciful, forgiving Father, believ-\ning that He will do just as He has promised. Let those who desire\nthe blessing of God knock, and wait at the throne of mercy, with\nfirm assurance, saying, \u201cFor thou, O Lord, hast said, \u2018For everyone\nthat asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth, and to him that\nknocketh it shall be opened.\u2019\u201d The Lord longs to have those who\nseek after God believe in Him who is able to do all things.\nThe Lord has sought to show us how ready is God to hear and\nanswer our request by the use of a most familiar and commonplace\noccurrence. He said: \u201cWhat man is there of you, whom if his son\nask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give\nhim a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts\nunto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in\nheaven give good things to them that ask him?\u201d (Matthew 7:9-11).\nChrist made an appeal to us concerning the willingness of God to\nSurrender and Confession 303\nhelp, arguing from the natural love of the parent to his offspring.\nWhat father could turn from his son who asks bread? Should anyone\ndishonor God by imagining that He will not respond to the call of His\nchildren? Would we think a parent capable of trifling with his child,\nand tantalizing him by raising his expectation only to disappoint\nhim? Will a father promise to give good and nourishing food to his\nchild and then give him a stone? If ye then, being human and evil,\ngive good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father\nwhich is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him? The Lord\nassures those that ask Him that He will give them the Holy Spirit.\nWith the confession of the repenting, believing sinner, Christ\nmingles His own righteousness, that the prayer of fallen man may\ngo up as fragrant incense before the Father, and the grace of God be\nimparted to the believing soul. Jesus says to the trembling, repenting\nsoul: \u201cLet him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace\nwith me; and he shall make peace with me\u201d (Isaiah 27:5). \u201cCome\nnow, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins\nbe as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red [330]\nlike crimson, they shall be as wool\u201d (Isaiah 1:18). Will you let Him\nreason with you? Will you commit to Him the keeping of your\nsoul as unto a faithful Creator? Come then, and let us live in the\nlight of His countenance, and pray, as did David, \u201cPurge me with\nhyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than\nsnow\u201d (Psalm 51:7). By faith apply the blood of Christ to your heart,\nfor that alone can make you whiter than snow. But you say, \u201cThis\nsurrender of all my idols will break my heart.\u201d This giving up of\nall for God is represented by your falling upon the Rock and being\nbroken. Then give up all for Him; for unless you are broken, you\nare worthless.\nWhen you turn away from the broken cisterns that can hold no\nwater, and in the name of Jesus your Advocate come directly to God,\nasking for the things you need, the righteousness of Christ will be\nrevealed as your righteousness, the virtue of Christ as your virtue.\nYou will then understand that justification will come alone through\nfaith in Christ; for in Jesus is revealed the perfection of the character\nof God; in His life is manifested the outworking of the principles\nof holiness. Through the atoning blood of Christ the sinner is set\nfree from bondage and condemnation; through the perfection of\n304 Selected Messages Book 1\nthe sinless Substitute and Surety, he may run in the race of humble\nobedience to all God\u2019s commandments. Without Christ he is under\nthe condemnation of the law, always a sinner, but through faith in\nChrist he is made just before God.\nChapter 50\u2014Come and Seek and Find [331]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, December 19,\n1892.]\nIt is impossible for man to save himself. He may deceive him-\nself in regard to this matter, but he cannot save himself. Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness alone can avail for his salvation, and this is the gift of\nGod. This is the wedding garment in which you may appear as a\nwelcome guest at the marriage supper of the Lamb. Let faith take\nhold of Christ without delay, and you will be a new creature in Jesus,\na light to the world.\nChrist is called \u201cthe Lord our righteousness,\u201d and through faith\neach one should say, \u201cThe Lord my righteousness.\u201d When faith lays\nhold upon this gift of God, the praise of God will be upon our lips,\nand we shall be able to say to others, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God,\nwhich taketh away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29). We shall then\nbe able to tell the lost concerning the plan of salvation, that while\nthe world was lying under the curse of sin, the Lord presented terms\nof mercy to the fallen and hopeless sinner, and revealed the value\nand meaning of His grace. Grace is unmerited favor. The angels,\nwho know nothing of sin, do not understand what it is to have grace\nexercised toward them; but our sinfulness calls for the exercise of [332]\ngrace from a merciful God. It was grace that sent our Saviour to\nseek us as wanderers and bring us back to the fold.\nHave you a sense of want in your soul? Do you hunger and thirst\nafter righteousness? Then this is an evidence that Christ has wrought\nupon your heart, and created this sense of need, in order that He may\nbe sought after to do those things for you through the endowment\nof His Holy Spirit which it is impossible for you to do for yourself.\nThe Lord specifies no conditions except that you hunger for His\nmercy, desiring His counsel, and long for His love. \u201cAsk!\u201d The\n305\n306 Selected Messages Book 1\nasking makes it manifest that you realize your necessity, and if you\nask in faith, you will receive. The Lord has pledged His word, and it\ncannot fail. That you feel and know that you are a sinner is sufficient\nargument in asking for His mercy and compassion. The condition\nupon which you may come to God is not that you shall be holy, but\nthat you shall ask God to cleanse you from all sin and purify you\nfrom all iniquity. Then why wait longer? Why not take God at His\nword, and say:\n\u201cHere, Lord, I give myself to Thee,\n\u2018Tis all that I can do\u201d?\nIf Satan comes to cast his shadow between you and God, accus-\ning you of sin, tempting you to distrust God and doubt His mercy,\nsay: I cannot allow my weakness to come between me and God; for\nHe is my strength. My sins, which are many, are laid upon Jesus,\nmy divine Substitute and Sacrifice.\n\u201cNothing in my hand I bring.\nSimply to thy cross I cling.\u201d\nNo man can look within himself and find anything in his charac-\nter that will recommend him to God, or make his acceptance sure.\nIt is only through Jesus, whom the Father gave for the life of the\nworld, that the sinner may find access to God. Jesus alone is our\nRedeemer, our Advocate and Mediator; in Him is our only hope\nfor pardon, peace, and righteousness. It is by virtue of the blood[333]\nof Christ that the sin-stricken soul can be restored to soundness.\nChrist is the fragrance, the holy incense which makes your petition\nacceptable to the Father. Then can you not say:\n\u201cJust as I am, without one plea,\nBut that Thy blood was shed for me,\nAnd that Thou bid\u2019st me come to Thee,\nO Lamb of God, I come.\u201d\nComing to Christ does not require severe mental effort and\nagony; it is simply accepting the terms of salvation that God has\nmade plain in His Word. The blessing is free to all. The invitation is,\nCome and Seek and Find 307\n\u201cHo, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath\nno money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk\nwithout money and without price. Wherefore do ye spend money\nfor that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth\nnot? hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and\nlet your soul delight itself in fatness\u201d (Isaiah 55:1, 2).\nRighteousness Found in Christ\nThen come, and seek, and find. The reservoir of power is open, is\nfull and free. Come with humble hearts, not thinking that you must\ndo some good work to merit the favor of God, or that you must make\nyourself better before you can come to Christ. You are powerless\nto do good, and cannot better your condition. Apart from Christ\nwe have no merit, no righteousness. Our sinfulness, our weakness,\nour human imperfection make it impossible that we should appear\nbefore God unless we are clothed in Christ\u2019s spotless righteousness.\nWe are to be found in Him not having our own righteousness, but\nthe righteousness which is in Christ. Then in the name that is above\nevery name, the only name given among men whereby men can be\nsaved, claim the promise of God, saying, \u201cLord, forgive my sin; I put\nmy hands into Thy hand for help, and I must have it, or perish. I now\nbelieve.\u201d The Saviour says to the repenting sinner, \u201cNo man cometh [334]\nunto the Father, but by me\u201d (John 14:6), \u201cand him that cometh to me\nI will in no wise cast out\u201d (John 6:37). \u201cI am thy salvation\u201d (Psalm\n35:3).\nWhen you respond to the drawing of Christ, and join yourself\nto Him, you manifest saving faith. To talk of religious things in a\ncasual way, to pray for spiritual blessings without real soul hunger\nand living faith, avails little. The wondering crowd that pressed close\nabout Jesus realized no accession of vital power from the contact.\nBut when the poor, suffering woman, who for twelve years had been\nan invalid, in her great need put forth her hand and touched the hem\nof His garment, she felt the healing virtue. Hers was the touch of\nfaith, and Christ recognized that touch. He knew that virtue had gone\nout from Him, and turning about in the throng, He asked, \u201cWho\ntouched me?\u201d (Luke 8:45). Surprised at such a question, the disciples\nanswered, \u201cMaster, the multitude throng thee, ... and sayest thou,\n308 Selected Messages Book 1\nWho touched me? And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for\nI perceive that virtue is gone out of me. And when the woman saw\nthat she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before\nhim, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she\nhad touched him, and how she was healed immediately. And he\nsaid unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made\nthee whole; go in peace\u201d (Luke 8:45-48). The faith which avails to\nbring us in vital contact with Christ expresses on our part supreme\npreference, perfect reliance, entire consecration. This faith works\nby love and purifies the soul. It works in the life of the follower of\nChrist true obedience to God\u2019s commandments; for love to God and\nlove to man will be the result of vital connection with Christ. \u201cIf any\nman have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his\u201d (Romans 8:9).\nJesus says, \u201cI am the vine, ye are the branches\u201d (John 15:5). Can\nwe conceive of a more intimate relation than this implies? The fibers\nof the branch are identical with those of the vine. The communica-\ntion of life, strength, and nourishment from the trunk to the branches[335]\nis unobstructed and constant. The root sends its nourishment through\nthe branches. Such is the believer\u2019s relation to Christ, if he abides\nin Christ and draws his nourishment from Him. But this spiritual\nrelation between Christ and the soul can be established only through\nthe exercise of personal faith. \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to\nplease him\u201d (Hebrews 11:6); for it is faith that connects us with the\npower of heaven, and brings us strength for coping with the powers\nof darkness. \u201cThis is the victory that overcometh the world, even our\nfaith\u201d (1 John 5:4). Faith familiarizes the soul with the existence and\npresence of God, and, living with an eye single to the glory of God,\nmore and more we discern the beauty of His character, the excel-\nlence of His grace. Our souls become strong in spiritual power; for\nwe are breathing the atmosphere of heaven, and realizing that God\nis at our right hand, that we shall not be moved. We are rising above\nthe world, beholding Him who is the chief among ten thousand, the\none altogether lovely, and by beholding we are to become changed\ninto His image.\nChapter 51\u2014United With the Living Vine [336]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, December 26,\n1892.]\n\u201cIf any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are\npassed away; behold, all things are become new\u201d (2 Corinthians\n5:17). Nothing but divine power can regenerate the human heart and\nimbue souls with the love of Christ, which will ever manifest itself\nwith love for those for whom He died. The fruit of the Spirit is love,\njoy, peace, long-suffering, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.\nWhen a man is converted to God, a new moral taste is supplied, a new\nmotive power is given, and he loves the things that God loves; for\nhis life is bound up by the golden chain of the immutable promises\nto the life of Jesus. Love, joy, peace, and inexpressible gratitude will\npervade the soul, and the language of him who is blessed will be,\n\u201cThy gentleness hath made me great\u201d (Psalm 18:35).\nBut those who are waiting to behold a magical change in their\ncharacters without determined effort on their part to overcome sin,\nwill be disappointed. We have no reason to fear while looking to\nJesus, no reason to doubt but that He is able to save to the uttermost\nall that come unto Him; but we may constantly fear lest our old\nnature will again obtain the supremacy, that the enemy shall devise [337]\nsome snare whereby we shall again become his captives. We are to\nwork out our own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God\nthat worketh in you to will and to do of His good pleasure. With our\nlimited powers we are to be as holy in our sphere as God is holy in\nHis sphere. To the extent of our ability, we are to make manifest the\ntruth and love and excellence of the divine character. As wax takes\nthe impression of the seal, so the soul is to take the impression of\nthe Spirit of God and retain the image of Christ.\nWe are to grow daily in spiritual loveliness. We shall fail often\nin our efforts to copy the divine pattern. We shall often have to bow\n309\n310 Selected Messages Book 1\ndown to weep at the feet of Jesus, because of our shortcomings and\nmistakes; but we are not to be discouraged; we are to pray more\nfervently, believe more fully, and try again with more steadfastness\nto grow into the likeness of our Lord. As we distrust our own power,\nwe shall trust the power of our Redeemer, and render praise to God,\nwho is the health of our countenance, and our God.\nWherever there is union with Christ there is love. Whatever other\nfruits we may bear, if love be missing, they profit nothing. Love to\nGod and our neighbor is the very essence of our religion. No one\ncan love Christ and not love His children. When we are united to\nChrist, we have the mind of Christ. Purity and love shine forth in the\ncharacter, meekness and truth control the life. The very expression\nof the countenance is changed. Christ abiding in the soul exerts a\ntransforming power, and the outward aspect bears witness to the\npeace and joy that reign within. We drink in the love of Christ, as\nthe branch draws nourishment from the vine. If we are grafted in\nChrist, if fiber by fiber we have been united with the Living Vine,\nwe shall give evidence of the fact by bearing rich clusters of living\nfruit. If we are connected with the Light, we shall be channels of\nlight, and in our words and works we shall reflect light to the world.\nThose who are truly Christians are bound with the chain of love[338]\nwhich links earth to heaven, which binds finite man to the infinite\nGod. The light that shines in the face of Jesus Christ shines in the\nhearts of His followers, to the glory of God.\nBy beholding we are to become changed; and as we meditate\nupon the perfections of the divine Model, we shall desire to become\nwholly transformed, and renewed in the image of His purity. It\nis by faith in the Son of God that transformation takes place in\nthe character, and the child of wrath becomes the child of God.\nHe passes from death unto life; he becomes spiritual and discerns\nspiritual things. The wisdom of God enlightens his mind, and he\nbeholds wondrous things out of His law. As a man is converted\nby the truth, the work of transformation of character goes on. He\nhas an increased measure of understanding. In becoming a man of\nobedience to God, he has the mind of Christ, and the will of God\nbecomes his will.\nHe who places himself unreservedly under the guidance of the\nSpirit of God, will find that his mind expands and develops. He\nUnited With the Living Vine 311\nobtains an education in the service of God which is not one-sided and\ndeficient, developing a one-sided character, but one which results in\nsymmetry and completeness. Weaknesses that have been manifested\nin a vacillating will and powerless character, are overcome, for\ncontinual devotion and piety bring the man in such close relation to\nChrist that he has the mind of Christ. He is one with Christ, having\nsoundness and strength of principle. His perception is clear, and he\nmanifests that wisdom which comes from God. Says James, \u201cWho\nis a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew\nout of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom\u201d\n(James 3:13). \u201cThe wisdom that is from above is first pure, then\npeaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good\nfruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of\nrighteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace\u201d (James\n3:17, 18). This will be the wisdom manifested by him who takes\nthe cup of salvation and calls upon the name of the Lord. This\nsalvation, which offers pardon to the transgressor, presents to him [339]\nthe righteousness that will bear the scrutiny of the Omniscient One,\ngives victory over the powerful enemy of God and man, provides\neternal life and joy for its receiver, and may well be a theme of\nrejoicing to the humble, who hear thereof and are glad.\nThe Parable of the Lost Sheep\nThe beautiful parable that Christ gave of the one lost sheep, of\nthe shepherd that left the ninety and nine to go in search of that\nwhich was lost, illustrates the work of Christ, the sinner\u2019s condition,\nand the rejoicing of the universe over the salvation of the soul. The\nshepherd did not look carelessly over the sheep, and say, \u201cI have\nninety and nine, and it will cost me too much trouble to go in search\nof the straying one; let him come back, and I will open the door\nof the sheepfold that he may come in; but I cannot go after him.\u201d\nNo; no sooner does the sheep go astray than the countenance of the\nshepherd is filled with grief and anxiety. He counts and recounts\nthe flock, and when he is certain that one sheep is lost, he slumbers\nnot. He leaves the ninety and nine within the fold, and, however\ndark and tempestuous the night, however perilous and unpleasant\nthe way, however long and tedious the service, he does not weary,\n312 Selected Messages Book 1\nhe does not falter, until the lost is found. And when it is found, he\nlays the weary, exhausted sheep on his shoulder, and, with cheerful\ngratitude that his search has not been in vain, he bears back the\nwanderer to the fold. His gratitude finds expression in the melodious\nsongs of rejoicing, and he calls upon his friends and neighbors,\nsaying unto them, \u201cRejoice with me; for I have found my sheep\nwhich was lost\u201d (Luke 15:6). So when a wanderer is found by\nthe Great Shepherd of the sheep, heavenly angels respond to the\nShepherd\u2019s note of joy. When the lost is found, heaven and earth\nunite in thanksgiving and rejoicing. \u201cJoy shall be in heaven over one\nsinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,\nwhich need no repentance\u201d (Luke 15:7).\nChapter 52\u2014Christ Our High Priest [340]\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[Manuscript 50, 1900.]\nJustice demands that sin be not merely pardoned, but the death\npenalty must be executed. God, in the gift of His only-begotten\nSon, met both these requirements. By dying in man\u2019s stead, Christ\nexhausted the penalty and provided a pardon.\nMan through sin has been severed from the life of God. His\nsoul is palsied through the machinations of Satan, the author of sin.\nOf himself he is incapable of sensing sin, incapable of appreciating\nand appropriating the divine nature. Were it brought within his\nreach there is nothing in it that his natural heart would desire it.\nThe bewitching power of Satan is upon him. All the ingenious\nsubterfuges the devil can suggest are presented to his mind to prevent\nevery good impulse. Every faculty and power given him of God has\nbeen used as a weapon against the divine Benefactor. So, although\nHe loves him, God cannot safely impart to him the gifts and blessings\nHe desires to bestow.\nBut God will not be defeated by Satan. He sent His Son into the\nworld, that through His taking the human form and nature, humanity\nand divinity combined in Him would elevate man in the scale of\nmoral value with God.\nThere is no other way for man\u2019s salvation. \u201cWithout me,\u201d says [341]\nChrist, \u201cye can do nothing\u201d (John 15:5). Through Christ, and Christ\nalone, the springs of life can vitalize man\u2019s nature, transform his\ntastes, and set his affections flowing toward heaven. Through the\nunion of the divine with the human nature Christ could enlighten the\nunderstanding and infuse His life-giving properties through the soul\ndead in trespasses and sins.\nWhen the mind is drawn to the cross of Calvary, Christ by im-\nperfect sight is discerned on the shameful cross. Why did He die? In\n313\n314 Selected Messages Book 1\nconsequence of sin. What is sin? The transgression of the law. Then\nthe eyes are open to see the character of sin. The law is broken but\ncannot pardon the transgressor. It is our schoolmaster, condemning\nto punishment. Where is the remedy? The law drives us to Christ,\nwho was hanged upon the cross that He might be able to impart\nHis righteousness to fallen, sinful man and thus present men to His\nFather in His righteous character.\nChrist on the cross not only draws men to repentance toward God\nfor the transgression of His law\u2014for whom God pardons He first\nmakes penitent\u2014but Christ has satisfied Justice; He has proffered\nHimself as an atonement. His gushing blood, His broken body,\nsatisfy the claims of the broken law, and thus He bridges the gulf\nwhich sin has made. He suffered in the flesh, that with His bruised\nand broken body He might cover the defenseless sinner. The victory\ngained at His death on Calvary broke forever the accusing power\nof Satan over the universe and silenced his charges that self-denial\nwas impossible with God and therefore not essential in the human\nfamily.\nSatan\u2019s position in heaven had been next to the Son of God. He\nwas first among the angels. His power had been debasing, but God\ncould not reveal it in its true light and carry all heaven in harmony\nwith Him in removing him with his evil influences. His power was\nincreasing, but the evil was yet unrecognized. It was a deadly power\nto the universe, but for the security of the worlds and the government\nof heaven, it was necessary that it should develop and be revealed in\nits true light.\nSelf-denial With God[342]\nIn carrying out his enmity to Christ until He hung upon the cross\nof Calvary, with wounded, bruised body and broken heart, Satan\ncompletely uprooted himself from the affections of the universe.\nIt was then seen that God had in His Son denied Himself, giving\nHimself for the sins of the world, because He loved mankind. The\nCreator was revealed in the Son of the infinite God. Here the ques-\ntion, \u201cCan there be self-denial with God?\u201d was forever answered.\nChrist was God, and condescending to be made flesh, He assumed\nChrist Our High Priest 315\nhumanity and became obedient unto death, that He might undergo\ninfinite sacrifice.\nWhatever sacrifice a human being could undergo Christ endured,\nnotwithstanding Satan put forth every effort to seduce Him with\ntemptations; but the greater the temptation, the more perfect was the\nsacrifice. All that was possible for man to endure in the conflict with\nSatan, Christ endured in His human and divine nature combined.\nObedient, sinless to the last, He died for man, his substitute and\nsurety, enduring all that men ever endure from the deceiving tempter,\nthat man may overcome by being a partaker of the divine nature.\nPure truth was found to be a match for falsehood, honesty and\nintegrity for subtlety and intrigue, in everyone who is, like Christ,\nwilling to sacrifice all, even life itself, for the truth\u2019s sake. To resist\nSatan\u2019s desires is no easy task. It demands a firm hold of the divine\nnature from beginning to end, or it cannot be done. Christ, in the\nvictories achieved in His death on Calvary\u2019s cross, plainly lays open\nthe way for man, and thus makes it possible for him to keep the law\nof God through the Way, the Truth, and the Life. There is no other\nway.\nThe righteousness of Christ is presented as a free gift to the\nsinner if he will accept it. He has nothing of his own but what is\ntainted and corrupted, polluted with sin, utterly repulsive to a pure\nand holy God. Only through the righteous character of Jesus Christ\ncan man come nigh to God.\nChrist as high priest within the veil so immortalized Calvary that [343]\nthough He liveth unto God, He dies continually to sin, and thus if\nany man sin, he has an advocate with the Father.\nHe arose from the tomb enshrouded with a cloud of angels in\nwondrous power and glory\u2014the Deity and humanity combined. He\ntook in His grasp the world over which Satan claimed to preside as\nhis lawful territory, and by His wonderful work in giving His life,\nHe restored the whole race of men to favor with God....\nLet no one take the limited, narrow position that any of the works\nof man can help in the least possible way to liquidate the debt of his\ntransgression. This is a fatal deception. If you would understand it,\nyou must cease haggling over your pet ideas, and with humble hearts\nsurvey the atonement. This matter is so dimly comprehended that\nthousands upon thousands claiming to be sons of God are children\n316 Selected Messages Book 1\nof the wicked one, because they will depend on their own works.\nGod always demanded good works, the law demands it, but because\nman placed himself in sin where his good works were valueless,\nJesus\u2019 righteousness alone can avail. Christ is able to save to the\nuttermost because He ever liveth to make intercession for us. All\nthat man can possibly do toward his own salvation is to accept the\ninvitation, \u201cWhosoever will, let him take the water of life freely\u201d\n(Revelation 22:17). No sin can be committed by man for which\nsatisfaction has not been met on Calvary. Thus the cross, in earnest\nappeals, continually proffers to the sinner a thorough expiation.\nRepentance and Pardon\nAs you near the cross of Calvary there is seen love that is without\na parallel. As you by faith grasp the meaning of the sacrifice, you see\nyourself a sinner, condemned by a broken law. This is repentance.\nAs you come with humble heart, you find pardon, for Christ Jesus is\nrepresented as continually standing at the altar, momentarily offering\nup the sacrifice for the sins of the world. He is a minister of the\ntrue tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man. The typical[344]\nshadows of the Jewish tabernacle no longer possess any virtue. A\ndaily and yearly typical atonement is no longer to be made, but\nthe atoning sacrifice through a mediator is essential because of the\nconstant commission of sin. Jesus is officiating in the presence of\nGod, offering up His shed blood, as it had been a lamb slain. Jesus\npresents the oblation offered for every offense and every shortcoming\nof the sinner.\nChrist, our Mediator, and the Holy Spirit are constantly interced-\ning in man\u2019s behalf, but the Spirit pleads not for us as does Christ,\nwho presents His blood, shed from the foundation of the world; the\nSpirit works upon our hearts, drawing out prayers and penitence,\npraise and thanksgiving. The gratitude which flows from our lips\nis the result of the Spirit\u2019s striking the cords of the soul in holy\nmemories, awakening the music of the heart.\nThe religious services, the prayers, the praise, the penitent con-\nfession of sin ascend from true believers as incense to the heavenly\nsanctuary, but passing through the corrupt channels of humanity,\nthey are so defiled that unless purified by blood, they can never be\nChrist Our High Priest 317\nof value with God. They ascend not in spotless purity, and unless\nthe Intercessor, who is at God\u2019s right hand, presents and purifies\nall by His righteousness, it is not acceptable to God. All incense\nfrom earthly tabernacles must be moist with the cleansing drops\nof the blood of Christ. He holds before the Father the censer of\nHis own merits, in which there is no taint of earthly corruption. He\ngathers into this censer the prayers, the praise, and the confessions of\nHis people, and with these He puts His own spotless righteousness.\nThen, perfumed with the merits of Christ\u2019s propitiation, the incense\ncomes up before God wholly and entirely acceptable. Then gracious\nanswers are returned.\nOh, that all may see that everything in obedience, in penitence,\nin praise and thanksgiving, must be placed upon the glowing fire\nof the righteousness of Christ. The fragrance of this righteousness\nascends like a cloud around the mercy seat.\nChapter 53\u2014Transformation Through Faith and[345]\nObedience\nChrist, Our Divine Sin Bearer\n[This article appeared in The Signs of the Times, June 5, 1893.]\nThe teaching of Christ in the gospel is in perfect harmony with\nthe teaching of Christ through the prophets in the Old Testament.\nThe prophets spoke through the messengers of Christ in the Old\nTestament as much as the apostles voiced His messages in the New\nTestament, and there is no contradiction between their teachings. But\nSatan has ever worked and is still working with all deceivableness\nof unrighteousness to make the Word of God of none effect. He\nseeks to make mysterious that which is simple and plain. He has\nhad long experience in this work. He knows the character of God,\nand through his subtlety he has captivated the world. It was through\nmaking the word of God of none effect that sin was brought into\nthe world. Adam believed the falsehood of Satan, and through his\nmisrepresentation of the character of God, Adam\u2019s life was changed\nand marred. He disobeyed the commandment of God, and did the\nvery thing the Lord told him not to do. Through disobedience Adam\nfell; but had he endured the test, and been loyal to God, the floodgates\nof woe would not have been opened upon our world. [346]\nThrough belief in Satan\u2019s misrepresentation of God, man\u2019s char-\nacter and destiny were changed, but if men will believe in the Word\nof God, they will be transformed in mind and character, and fitted\nfor eternal life. To believe that \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave\nhis only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life\u201d (John 3:16), will change the heart,\nand reproduce in man the image of God.\nAs many are today, so (before his conversion) Paul was very\nconfident in an hereditary piety; but his confidence was founded\non falsehood. It was faith out of Christ, for he trusted in forms\n318\nTransformation Through Faith and Obedience 319\nand ceremonies. His zeal for the law was disconnected from Christ\nand was valueless. His boast was that he was blameless in his\nperformance of the deeds of the law; but the Christ who made the\nlaw of any value he refused. He was confident that he was right. He\nsays: \u201cI verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things\ncontrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did\nin Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having\nreceived authority from the chief priests; and when they were put\nto death, I gave my voice against them\u201d (Acts 26:9, 10). For a time\nPaul did a very cruel work, thinking that he was doing God service;\nfor he says, \u201cI did it ignorantly in unbelief\u201d (1 Timothy 1:13). But\nhis sincerity did not justify his work, or make error truth.\nFaith is the medium through which truth or error finds a lodging\nplace in the mind. It is by the same act of mind that truth or error is\nreceived, but it makes a decided difference whether we believe the\nWord of God or the sayings of men. When Christ revealed Himself\nto Paul, and he was convinced that he was persecuting Jesus in\nthe person of His saints, he accepted the truth as it is in Jesus. A\ntransforming power was manifested on mind and character, and he\nbecame a new man in Christ Jesus. He received the truth so fully\nthat neither earth nor hell could shake his faith.\nThere are many who cry, \u201cBelieve, only believe.\u201d Ask them [347]\nwhat you are to believe. Are you to believe the lies forged by\nSatan against God\u2019s holy, just, and good law? God does not use\nHis great and precious grace to make of none effect His law, but to\nestablish His law. What is the decision of Paul? He says: \u201cWhat\nshall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known\nsin, but by the law.... For I was alive without the law once: but\nwhen the commandment came, sin revived, and [the commandment\nthen ended?\u2014No.] I [Paul] died.... Wherefore the law is [standing\ndirectly in the way of my having liberty and peace?\u2014No.] holy, and\nthe commandment holy, and just, and good\u201d (Romans 7:7-12).\nThe Law Cannot Pardon\nPaul learned that there was no power in the law to pardon the\ntransgressor of law. \u201cBy the deeds of the law there shall no flesh\nbe justified\u201d (Romans 3:20). \u201cFor what the law could not do, in\n320 Selected Messages Book 1\nthat it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the\nlikeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that\nthe righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not\nafter the flesh, but after the Spirit\u201d (Romans 8:3, 4).\nThe Lord saw our fallen condition; He saw our need of grace, and\nbecause He loved our souls, He has given us grace and peace. Grace\nmeans favor to one who is undeserving, to one who is lost. The fact\nthat we are sinners, instead of shutting us away from the mercy and\nlove of God, makes the exercise of His love to us a positive necessity\nin order that we may be saved. Christ says, \u201cYe have not chosen\nme, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and\nbring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain\u201d (John 15:16).\nWhen Adam fell, provision was made for his restoration. In\ndue time Jesus, the Prince of life, came to our world to enter into\ncontroversy with the powers of darkness. In this world Satan had an\nopportunity to exhibit the result of the working out of his principles\nof freedom from all law, and Christ, by His unswerving obedience to\nHis Father\u2019s commandments, made manifest the result of practicing[348]\nthe principles of righteousness. In accordance with his principles\nof evil, Satan harassed the Son of God with fierce temptations,\nand finally brought Him to the judgment hall, that He might be\ncondemned to death without cause. The confederacy of evil moved\nupon the hearts of men to work out the principles of evil. Christ\nand Barabbas were presented before the multitude. Barabbas was\na notable robber and murderer; Christ was the Son of God. Pilate\nlooked upon the two, and thought there would be no hesitation in\nthe choice of Jesus. The marks of nobility, intelligence, and purity\nwere plainly revealed in His countenance, in marked contrast to the\ncoarse features of Barabbas. He asked, \u201cWhether of the twain will\nye that I release unto you? (Matthew 27:21). And the hoarse cry\nof the infuriated mob was heard, calling, \u201cBarabbas.\u201d \u201cPilate saith\nunto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ?\nThey all say unto him, Let him be crucified. And the governor said,\nWhy, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying,\nLet him be crucified\u201d (Matthew 27:22, 23).\nTransformation Through Faith and Obedience 321\nSatan Defeated by Christ\u2019s Death\nIn this choice the principles of Satan were made manifest; and\nthe hosts of heaven, and all the worlds that God had created, judged\nthat Satan was an accuser of the brethren, a liar, and a murderer.\nIn heaven and among the unfallen worlds the question of Satan\u2019s\ndeceiving power, of his malignant principles, was settled, and the\nperfect purity and holiness of Christ, who was bearing the test and\ntrial in behalf of fallen man, was forever proved. Through the devel-\nopment of Satan\u2019s character and principles, he was forever uprooted\nfrom the affection of the unfallen worlds, and the controversy con-\ncerning his claims and the claims of Christ was forever settled in\nheaven. The righteousness manifested in the character of Christ was\nforever to be the anchor, the saving hope, of the world. Every soul\nwho chooses Christ can say with faith, \u201cThe Lord my righteousness.\u201d\nChrist was \u201cdespised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, [349]\nand acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from\nhim; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath\nborne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him\nstricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our\ntransgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of\nour peace was upon him, and with his stripes we are healed\u201d (Isaiah\n53:3-5).\nThe grace of Christ and the law of God are inseparable. In Je-\nsus mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have\nkissed each other. In His life and character He not only reveals\nthe character of God, but the possibility of man. He was the rep-\nresentative of God and the exemplar of humanity. He presented to\nthe world what humanity might become when united by faith with\ndivinity. The only-begotten Son of God took upon Him the nature of\nman, and established His cross between earth and heaven. Through\nthe cross, man was drawn to God, and God to man. Justice moved\nfrom its high and awful position, and the heavenly hosts, the armies\nof holiness, drew near to the cross, bowing with reverence; for at\nthe cross justice was satisfied. Through the cross the sinner was\ndrawn from the stronghold of sin, from the confederacy of evil, and\nat every approach to the cross his heart relents and in penitence he\ncries, \u201cIt was my sins that crucified the Son of God.\u201d At the cross\n322 Selected Messages Book 1\nhe leaves his sins, and through the grace of Christ his character is\ntransformed. The Redeemer raises the sinner from the dust, and\nplaces him under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. As the sinner\nlooks upon the Redeemer, he finds hope, assurance, and joy. Faith\ntakes hold of Christ in love. Faith works by love, and purifies the\nsoul.\nChapter 54\u2014The Subject Presented in 1883 [350]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[Morning talks to the ministers assembled at the General\nConference, Battle Creek, Michigan, November, 1883. Published in\nGospel Workers (1892 Ed.), 411-415, under the title \u201cChrist Our\nRighteousness.\u201d]\n\u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our\nsins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nGod requires that we confess our sins, and humble our hearts\nbefore Him; but at the same time we should have confidence in\nHim as a tender Father, who will not forsake those who put their\ntrust in Him. Many of us walk by sight, and not by faith. We\nbelieve the things that are seen, but do not appreciate the precious\npromises given us in God\u2019s Word; and yet we cannot dishonor God\nmore decidedly than by showing that we distrust what He says, and\nquestion whether the Lord is in earnest with us or is deceiving us.\nGod does not give us up because of our sins. We may make\nmistakes, and grieve His Spirit; but when we repent, and come\nto Him with contrite hearts, He will not turn us away. There are\nhindrances to be removed. Wrong feelings have been cherished, and\nthere have been pride, self-sufficiency, impatience, and murmurings.\nAll these separate us from God. Sins must be confessed; there must\nbe a deeper work of grace in the heart. Those who feel weak and [351]\ndiscouraged may become strong men of God, and do noble work for\nthe Master. But they must work from a high standpoint; they must\nbe influenced by no selfish motives.\nMerits of Christ Our Only Hope\nWe must learn in the school of Christ. Nothing but His righteous-\nness can entitle us to one of the blessings of the covenant of grace.\nWe have long desired and tried to obtain these blessings, but have not\n323\n324 Selected Messages Book 1\nreceived them because we have cherished the idea that we could do\nsomething to make ourselves worthy of them. We have not looked\naway from ourselves, believing that Jesus is a living Saviour. We\nmust not think that our own grace and merits will save us; the grace\nof Christ is our only hope of salvation. Through His prophet the\nLord promises, \u201cLet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous\nman his thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have\nmercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon\u201d\n(Isaiah 55:7). We must believe the naked promise, and not accept\nfeeling for faith. When we trust God fully, when we rely upon the\nmerits of Jesus as a sin-pardoning Saviour, we shall receive all the\nhelp that we can desire.\nWe look to self, as though we had power to save ourselves; but\nJesus died for us because we are helpless to do this. In Him is our\nhope, our justification, our righteousness. We should not despond,\nand fear that we have no Saviour, or that He has no thoughts of\nmercy toward us. At this very time He is carrying on His work in\nour behalf, inviting us to come to Him in our helplessness and be\nsaved. We dishonor Him by our unbelief. It is astonishing how we\ntreat our very best Friend, how little confidence we repose in Him\nwho is able to save to the uttermost, and who has given us every\nevidence of His great love.\nMy brethren, are you expecting that your merit will recommend\nyou to the favor of God, thinking that you must be free from sin\nbefore you trust His power to save? If this is the struggle going on in\nyour mind, I fear you will gain no strength, and will finally become\ndiscouraged.\nLook and Live[352]\nIn the wilderness, when the Lord permitted poisonous serpents\nto sting the rebellious Israelites, Moses was directed to lift up a\nbrazen serpent and bid all the wounded look to it and live. But many\nsaw no help in this Heaven-appointed remedy. The dead and dying\nwere all around them, and they knew that without divine help their\nfate was certain; but they would lament their wounds, their pains,\ntheir sure death, until their strength was gone, and their eyes were\nglazed, when they might have had instant healing.\nSubject Presented in 1883 325\n\u201cAs Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,\u201d even so was\n\u201cthe Son of man lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not\nperish, but have eternal life\u201d (John 3:14, 15). If you are conscious of\nyour sins, do not devote all your powers to mourning over them, but\nlook and live. Jesus is our only Saviour; and although millions who\nneed to be healed will reject His offered mercy, not one who trusts\nin His merits will be left to perish. While we realize our helpless\ncondition without Christ, we must not be discouraged; we must rely\nupon a crucified and risen Saviour. Poor, sin-sick, discouraged soul,\nlook and live. Jesus has pledged His word; He will save all who\ncome unto Him.\nCome to Jesus, and receive rest and peace. You may have the\nblessing even now. Satan suggests that you are helpless, and cannot\nbless yourself. It is true; you are helpless. But lift up Jesus before\nhim: \u201cI have a risen Saviour. In Him I trust, and He will never\nsuffer me to be confounded. In His name I triumph. He is my\nrighteousness, and my crown of rejoicing.\u201d Let no one here feel that\nhis case is hopeless; for it is not. You may see that you are sinful\nand undone; but it is just on this account that you need a Saviour. If\nyou have sins to confess, lose no time. These moments are golden.\n\u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,\nand to cleanse us from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9). Those\nwho hunger and thirst after righteousness will be filled; for Jesus has [353]\npromised it. Precious Saviour! His arms are open to receive us, and\nHis great heart of love is waiting to bless us.\nSome seem to feel that they must be on probation and must\nprove to the Lord that they are reformed, before they can claim\nHis blessing. But these dear souls may claim the blessing even\nnow. They must have His grace, the Spirit of Christ, to help their\ninfirmities, or they cannot form a Christian character. Jesus loves to\nhave us come to Him, just as we are\u2014sinful, helpless, dependent.\nRepentance a Gift of God\nRepentance, as well as forgiveness, is the gift of God through\nChrist. It is through the influence of the Holy Spirit that we are\nconvicted of sin, and feel our need of pardon. None but the contrite\nare forgiven; but it is the grace of God that makes the heart penitent.\n326 Selected Messages Book 1\nHe is acquainted with all our weaknesses and infirmities, and He\nwill help us.\nSome who come to God by repentance and confession, and even\nbelieve that their sins are forgiven, still fail of claiming, as they\nshould, the promises of God. They do not see that Jesus is an ever-\npresent Saviour; and they are not ready to commit the keeping of\ntheir souls to Him, relying upon Him to perfect the work of grace\nbegun in their hearts. While they think they are committing them-\nselves to God, there is a great deal of self-dependence. There are\nconscientious souls that trust partly to God, and partly to themselves.\nThey do not look to God, to be kept by His power, but depend upon\nwatchfulness against temptation, and the performance of certain\nduties for acceptance with Him. There are no victories in this kind\nof faith. Such persons toil to no purpose; their souls are in continual\nbondage, and they find no rest until their burdens are laid at the feet\nof Jesus.\nThere is need of constant watchfulness, and of earnest, loving\ndevotion; but these will come naturally when the soul is kept by\nthe power of God through faith. We can do nothing, absolutely\nnothing, to commend ourselves to divine favor. We must not trust[354]\nat all to ourselves nor to our good works; but when as erring, sinful\nbeings we come to Christ, we may find rest in His love. God will\naccept every one that comes to Him trusting wholly in the merits\nof a crucified Saviour. Love springs up in the heart. There may be\nno ecstasy of feeling, but there is an abiding, peaceful trust. Every\nburden is light; for the yoke which Christ imposes is easy. Duty\nbecomes a delight, and sacrifice a pleasure. The path that before\nseemed shrouded in darkness becomes bright with beams from the\nSun of Righteousness. This is walking in the light as Christ is in the\nlight.\nChapter 55\u2014Presented as Old Truth in New [355]\nFramework\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[Report of camp meeting at Ottawa, Kansas, printed in The Review\nand Herald, July 23, 1889.]\nAt the Kansas meeting my prayer to God was, that the power of\nthe enemy might be broken, and that the people who had been in\ndarkness might open their hearts and minds to the message that God\nshould send them, that they might see the truth, new to many minds,\nas old truth in new framework. The understanding of the people of\nGod has been blinded, for Satan has misrepresented the character\nof God. Our good and gracious Lord has been presented before the\npeople clothed in the attributes of Satan, and men and women who\nhave been seeking for truth, have so long regarded God in a false\nlight that it is difficult to dispel the cloud that obscures His glory\nfrom their view. Many have been living in an atmosphere of doubt,\nand it seems almost impossible for them to lay hold on the hope set\nbefore them in the gospel of Christ....\nOn Sabbath, truths were presented that were new to the majority\nof the congregation. Things new and old were brought forth from [356]\nthe treasure house of God\u2019s Word. Truths were revealed which the\npeople were scarcely able to comprehend and appropriate. Light\nflashed from the oracles of God in relation to the law and the gospel,\nin relation to the fact that Christ is our righteousness, which seemed\nto souls who were hungry for truth, as light too precious to be\nreceived.\nBut the labors of the Sabbath were not in vain. On Sunday\nmorning there was decided evidence that the Spirit of God was\nworking great changes in the moral and spiritual condition of those\nassembled. There was a surrendering of the mind and heart to\nGod, and precious testimonies were borne by those who had long\n327\n328 Selected Messages Book 1\nbeen in darkness. One brother spoke of the struggle that he had\nexperienced before he could receive the good news that Christ is our\nrighteousness. The conflict was severe, but the Lord was at work\nwith him, and his mind was changed, and his strength renewed. The\nLord presented the truth before him in clear lines, revealing the fact\nthat Christ alone is the source of all hope and salvation. \u201cIn him was\nlife; and the life was the light of men.\u201d \u201cAnd the Word was made\nflesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of\nthe only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth\u201d (John 1:4,\n14).\nOne of our young ministering brethren said that he had enjoyed\nmore of the blessing and love of God during that meeting than in\nall his life before. Another stated that the trials, perplexities, and\nconflicts which he had endured in his mind had been of such a\ncharacter that he had been tempted to give up everything. He had\nfelt that there was no hope for him, unless he could obtain more of\nthe grace of Christ; but through the influence of the meetings he\nhad experienced a change of heart, and had a better knowledge of\nsalvation through faith in Christ. He saw that it was his privilege\nto be justified by faith; he had peace with God, and with tears\nconfessed what relief and blessing had come to his soul. At every\nsocial meeting many testimonies were borne as to the peace, comfort,\nand joy the people had found in receiving light.\nWe thank the Lord with all the heart that we have precious light[357]\nto present before the people, and we rejoice that we have a message\nfor this time which is present truth. The tidings that Christ is our\nrighteousness has brought relief to many, many souls, and God says\nto His people, \u201cGo forward.\u201d The message to the Laodicean church\nis applicable to our condition. How plainly is pictured the position\nof those who think they have all the truth, who take pride in their\nknowledge of the Word of God, while its sanctifying power has not\nbeen felt in their lives. The fervor of the love of God is wanting in\ntheir hearts, but it is this very fervor of love that makes God\u2019s people\nthe light of the world.\nPresented as Old Truth in New Framework 329\nThe Laodicean Message\nThe True Witness says of a cold, lifeless, Christless church, \u201cI\nknow thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou\nwert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither\ncold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth\u201d (Revelation 3:15,\n16). Mark the following words: \u201cBecause thou sayest, I am rich,\nand increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest\nnot that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and\nnaked\u201d (Revelation 3:17). Here is represented a people who pride\nthemselves in their possession of spiritual knowledge and advan-\ntages. But they have not responded to the unmerited blessings that\nGod has bestowed upon them. They have been full of rebellion,\ningratitude, and forgetfulness of God; and still He has dealt with\nthem as a loving, forgiving father deals with an ungrateful, wayward\nson. They have resisted His grace, abused His privileges, slighted\nHis opportunities, and have been satisfied to sink down in content-\nment, in lamentable ingratitude, hollow formalism, and hypocritical\ninsincerity. With Pharisaic pride they have vaunted themselves till it\nhas been said of them, \u201cThou sayest, I am rich, and increased with\ngoods, and have need of nothing.\u201d\nHas not the Lord Jesus sent message after message of rebuke, of [358]\nwarning, of entreaty to these self-satisfied ones? Have not His coun-\nsels been despised and rejected? Have not His delegated messengers\nbeen treated with scorn, and their words been received as idle tales?\nChrist sees that which man does not see. He sees the sins which, if\nnot repented of, will exhaust the patience of a long-suffering God.\nChrist cannot take up the names of those who are satisfied in their\nown self-sufficiency. He cannot importune in behalf of a people who\nfeel no need of His help, who claim to know and possess everything.\nThe great Redeemer represents Himself as a heavenly merchant-\nman, laden with riches, calling from house to house, presenting\nHis priceless goods, and saying, \u201cI counsel thee to buy of me gold\ntried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that\nthou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not\nappear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.\nAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and\nrepent. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my\n330 Selected Messages Book 1\nvoice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with\nhim, and he with me\u201d (Revelation 3:18-20).\nLet us consider our condition before God; let us heed the counsel\nof the True Witness. Let none of us be filled with prejudice, as\nwere the Jews, that light may not come into our hearts. Let it not\nbe necessary for Christ to say of us as He did of them, \u201cYe will not\ncome to me, that ye might have life\u201d (John 5:40).\nIn every meeting since the General Conference, souls have ea-\ngerly accepted the precious message of the righteousness of Christ.\nWe thank God that there are souls who realize that they are in need of\nsomething which they do not possess\u2014gold of faith and love, white\nraiment of Christ\u2019s righteousness, eyesalve of spiritual discernment.\nIf you possess these precious gifts, the temple of the human soul\nwill not be like a desecrated shrine. Brethren and sisters, I call upon\nyou in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, to work where God\nworks. Now is the day of gracious opportunity and privilege.\nChapter 56\u2014A Truth Bearing the Divine [359]\nCredentials\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[Items drawn from reports on the reception of the message of\nrighteousness by faith as it was presented following the General\nConference held at Minneapolis in 1888.]\nA Message From God\n[Drawn from report of the camp meeting at Rome, New York.]\nThe present message\u2014justification by faith\u2014is a message from\nGod; it bears the divine credentials, for its fruit is unto holiness.\nSome who greatly need the precious truth that was presented before\nthem, we fear did not receive its benefit. They did not open the door\nof their hearts to welcome Jesus as a heavenly guest, and they have\nsuffered great loss. There is indeed a narrow way in which we must\nwalk; the cross is presented at every step. We must learn to live by\nfaith; then the darkest hours will be brightened by the blessed beams\nof the Sun of Righteousness.\nWe are not safe if we neglect to search the Scriptures daily for\nlight and knowledge. Earthly blessings cannot be obtained without\ntoil, and can we expect that spiritual and heavenly blessings will [360]\ncome without earnest effort on our part? The mines of truth are to\nbe worked. Says the psalmist, \u201cThe entrance of thy words giveth\nlight; it giveth understanding unto the simple\u201d (Psalm 119:130).\nThe Word of God must not be kept apart from our life. It must be\nentertained in the mind, welcomed in the heart, and be cherished,\nloved, and obeyed. We need also much more knowledge; we need\nto be enlightened in regard to the plan of salvation. There is not one\nin one hundred who understands for himself the Bible truth on this\nsubject that is so necessary to our present and eternal welfare. When\nlight begins to shine forth to make clear the plan of redemption to\n331\n332 Selected Messages Book 1\nthe people, the enemy works with all diligence that the light may\nbe shut away from the hearts of men. If we come to the Word of\nGod with a teachable, humble spirit, the rubbish of error will be\nswept away, and gems of truth, long hidden from our eyes, will be\ndiscovered.\nThere is great need that Christ should be preached as the only\nhope and salvation. When the doctrine of justification by faith was\npresented at the Rome meeting, it came to many as water comes to\nthe thirsty traveler. The thought that the righteousness of Christ is\nimputed to us, not because of any merit on our part, but as a free gift\nfrom God, seemed a precious thought.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nSeptember 3, 1889.\nNo Relish for Sin\nWhen we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, we shall\nhave no relish for sin; for Christ will be working with us. We may\nmake mistakes, but we will hate the sin that caused the sufferings of\nthe Son of God.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 18, 1890.\nExtreme Teaching\nThere are grand truths, long hidden under the rubbish of error,\nthat are to be revealed to the people. The doctrine of justification by\nfaith has been lost sight of by many who have professed to believe\nthe third angel\u2019s message. The Holiness people have gone to great[361]\nextremes on this point. With great zeal they have taught, \u201cOnly\nbelieve in Christ, and be saved; but away with the law of God.\u201d This\nis not the teaching of the Word of God. There is no foundation for\nsuch a faith. This is not the precious gem of truth that God has given\nto His people for this time. This doctrine misleads honest souls. The\nlight from the Word of God reveals the fact that the law must be\nproclaimed. Christ must be lifted up, because He is a Saviour who\nforgiveth transgression, iniquity, and sin, but will by no means clear\nthe guilty and unrepentant soul.\u2014The Review and Herald, August\n13, 1889.\nTruth Bearing the Divine Credentials 333\nThe Message Bears Fruit\n[Ellen G. White report of the fruitage of the message of\nrighteousness by faith observed at the General Conference of 1889\nin Battle Creek, Michigan, October 18 to November 5. Reference to\nthe spirit manifest at Minneapolis is to the situation which grew out\nof an approach to Bible study, at the General Conference of 1888,\nheld in Minneapolis, in an argumentative and debating spirit\naccompanied on the part of some with criticism and\nridicule.\u2014Compilers.]\nWe are having most excellent meetings. The spirit that was in\nthe meeting at Minneapolis is not here. All moves off in harmony.\nThere is a large attendance of delegates. Our five o\u2019clock morning\nmeeting is well attended, and the meetings good. All the testimonies\nto which I have listened have been of an elevating character. They\nsay that the past year has been the best of their life; the light shining\nforth from the Word of God has been clear and distinct\u2014justification\nby faith, Christ our righteousness. The experiences have been very\ninteresting.\nI have attended all but two morning meetings. At eight o\u2019clock\nBrother Jones speaks upon the subject of justification by faith, and\ngreat interest is manifested. There is a growth in faith and in the\nknowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. There are quite a\nnumber who have not had an opportunity to hear upon this subject\nbefore, but they are taking it in, and are being fed with large morsels\nfrom the Lord\u2019s table. The universal testimony from those who have [362]\nspoken has been that this message of light and truth which has come\nto our people is just the truth for this time, and wherever they go\namong the churches, light, and relief, and the blessing of God is sure\nto come in.\nWe have a feast of fat things, and when we see souls grasping\nthe light we are rejoiced, looking unto Jesus who is the author and\nfinisher of our faith. Christ is the great pattern; His character must\nbe our character. All excellence is in Him. Turning from man and\nevery other model, with open face we behold Jesus in all His glory.\nAnd their minds are filled with the grand and overpowering ideas\nof His excellency; every other object sinks into insignificance, and\nevery part of moral discipline is lost which does not promote their\n334 Selected Messages Book 1\nlikeness to His image. I see heights and depths that we may reach,\naccepting every ray of light and going forward to a greater light. The\nend is near, and God forbid that we shall be asleep at this time.\nI am so thankful to see with our ministering brethren a disposition\nto search the Scriptures for themselves. There has been a very great\nlack of deep searching of the Scriptures, storing the mind with the\ngems of truth. How much we all lose because we do not put to the\ntax our minds to search with much prayer for divine enlightenment\nto understand His Holy Word.\nI believe there will be a decided advance among our people, a\nmore earnest endeavor to keep pace with the third angel\u2019s message.\u2014\nManuscript 10, 1889.\nThe Beginning of the Loud Cry\nLet every one who claims to believe that the Lord is soon coming,\nsearch the Scriptures as never before; for Satan is determined to try\nevery device possible to keep souls in darkness, and blind the mind\nto the perils of the times in which we are living. Let every believer\ntake up his Bible with earnest prayer, that he may be enlightened\nby the Holy Spirit as to what is truth, that he may know more of\nGod and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent. Search for the truth as\nfor hidden treasures, and disappoint the enemy. The time of test is[363]\njust upon us, for the loud cry of the third angel has already begun\nin the revelation of the righteousness of Christ, the sin-pardoning\nRedeemer. This is the beginning of the light of the angel whose glory\nshall fill the whole earth. For it is the work of every one to whom the\nmessage of warning has come, to lift up Jesus, to present Him to the\nworld as revealed in types, as shadowed in symbols, as manifested\nin the revelations of the prophets, as unveiled in the lessons given to\nHis disciples and in the wonderful miracles wrought for the sons of\nmen. Search the Scriptures; for they are they that testify of Him.\nIf you would stand through the time of trouble, you must know\nChrist, and appropriate the gift of His righteousness, which He\nimputes to the repentant sinner.\u2014The Review and Herald, November\n22, 1892.\nTruth Bearing the Divine Credentials 335\nAppropriating the Righteousness of Christ\nThrough Christ, restoration as well as reconciliation is provided\nfor man. The gulf that was made by sin has been spanned by the\ncross of Calvary. A full, complete ransom has been paid by Jesus,\nby virtue of which the sinner is pardoned, and the justice of the law\nis maintained. All who believe that Christ is the atoning sacrifice\nmay come and receive pardon for their sins; for through the merit\nof Christ, communication has been opened between God and man.\nGod can accept me as His child, and I can claim Him and rejoice in\nHim as my loving Father. We must center our hopes of heaven upon\nChrist alone, because He is our substitute and surety.\nWe have transgressed the law of God, and by the deeds of the\nlaw shall no flesh be justified. The best efforts that man in his own\nstrength can make, are valueless to meet the holy and just law that\nhe has transgressed; but through faith in Christ he may claim the\nrighteousness of the Son of God as all-sufficient. Christ satisfied the\ndemands of the law in His human nature. He bore the curse of the law\nfor the sinner, made an atonement for him, that whosoever believeth\nin Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Genuine faith\nappropriates the righteousness of Christ, and the sinner is made an [364]\novercomer with Christ; for he is made a partaker of the divine nature,\nand thus divinity and humanity are combined.\nHe who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping\nthe law, is attempting an impossibility. Man cannot be saved without\nobedience, but his works should not be of himself; Christ should\nwork in him to will and to do of His good pleasure. If a man could\nsave himself by his own works, he might have something in himself\nin which to rejoice. The effort that man makes in his own strength to\nobtain salvation, is represented by the offering of Cain. All that man\ncan do without Christ is polluted with selfishness and sin; but that\nwhich is wrought through faith is acceptable to God. When we seek\nto gain heaven through the merits of Christ, the soul makes progress.\nLooking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, we may go\non from strength to strength, from victory to victory; for through\nChrist the grace of God has worked out our complete salvation.\nWithout faith it is impossible to please God. Living faith enables\nits possessor to lay hold on the merits of Christ, enables him to\n336 Selected Messages Book 1\nderive great comfort and satisfaction from the plan of salvation.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, July 1, 1890.\nChapter 57\u2014Christ the Way of Life [365]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, November 4,\n1890.]\n\u201cJesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom\nof God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is\nat hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel\u201d (Mark 1:14, 15).\nRepentance is associated with faith, and is urged in the gospel\nas essential to salvation. Paul preached repentance. He said, \u201cI kept\nback nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you,\nand have taught you publickly, and from house to house, testifying\nboth to the Jews and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and\nfaith toward our Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (Acts 20:20, 21). There is no\nsalvation without repentance. No impenitent sinner can believe with\nhis heart unto righteousness. Repentance is described by Paul as a\ngodly sorrow for sin, that \u201cworketh repentance to salvation not to be\nrepented of\u201d (2 Corinthians 7:10). This repentance has in it nothing\nof the nature of merit, but it prepares the heart for the acceptance of\nChrist as the only Saviour, the only hope of the lost sinner.\nAs the sinner looks to the law, his guilt is made plain to him,\nand pressed home to his conscience, and he is condemned. His only\ncomfort and hope is found in looking to the cross of Calvary. As [366]\nhe ventures upon the promises, taking God at His word, relief and\npeace come to his soul. He cries, \u201cLord, Thou hast promised to\nsave all who come unto Thee in the name of Thy Son. I am a lost,\nhelpless, hopeless soul. Lord, save, or I perish.\u201d His faith lays hold\non Christ, and he is justified before God.\nBut while God can be just, and yet justify the sinner through the\nmerits of Christ, no man can cover his soul with the garments of\nChrist\u2019s righteousness while practicing known sins, or neglecting\nknown duties. God requires the entire surrender of the heart, before\n337\n338 Selected Messages Book 1\njustification can take place; and in order for man to retain justifica-\ntion, there must be continual obedience, through active, living faith\nthat works by love and purifies the soul.\nJames writes of Abraham and says, \u201cWas not Abraham our father\njustified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?\nSeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith\nmade perfect? And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham\nbelieved God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he\nwas called the Friend of God. Ye see then how that by works a man\nis justified, and not by faith only\u201d (James 2:21-24). In order for man\nto be justified by faith, faith must reach a point where it will control\nthe affections and impulses of the heart; and it is by obedience that\nfaith itself is made perfect.\nFaith the Condition of Promise\nWithout the grace of Christ, the sinner is in a hopeless condition;\nnothing can be done for him; but through divine grace, supernatural\npower is imparted to the man, and works in mind and heart and\ncharacter. It is through the impartation of the grace of Christ that\nsin is discerned in its hateful nature, and finally driven from the soul\ntemple. It is through grace that we are brought into fellowship with\nChrist, to be associated with Him in the work of salvation. Faith\nis the condition upon which God has seen fit to promise pardon to\nsinners; not that there is any virtue in faith whereby salvation is\nmerited, but because faith can lay hold of the merits of Christ, the[367]\nremedy provided for sin. Faith can present Christ\u2019s perfect obedience\ninstead of the sinner\u2019s transgression and defection. When the sinner\nbelieves that Christ is his personal Saviour, then, according to His\nunfailing promises, God pardons his sin, and justifies him freely. The\nrepentant soul realizes that his justification comes because Christ,\nas his substitute and surety, has died for him, is his atonement and\nrighteousness.\n\u201cAbraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righ-\nteousness. Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of\ngrace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him\nthat justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness\u201d\n(Romans 4:3-5). Righteousness is obedience to the law. The law\nChrist the Way of Life 339\ndemands righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the law; but he\nis incapable of rendering it. The only way in which he can attain\nto righteousness is through faith. By faith he can bring to God the\nmerits of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of His Son to the\nsinner\u2019s account. Christ\u2019s righteousness is accepted in place of man\u2019s\nfailure, and God receives, pardons, justifies, the repentant, believing\nsoul, treats him as though he were righteous, and loves him as He\nloves His Son. This is how faith is accounted righteousness; and the\npardoned soul goes on from grace to grace, from light to a greater\nlight. He can say with rejoicing, \u201cNot by works of righteousness\nwhich we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the\nwashing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost; which he\nshed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; that being\njustified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope\nof eternal life\u201d (Titus 3:5-7).\nAgain: it is written, \u201cBut as many as received him, to them gave\nhe power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on\nhis name: which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,\nnor of the will of man, but of God\u201d (John 1:12, 13). Jesus declared,\n\u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d\n(John 3:3). \u201cExcept a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he\ncannot enter into the kingdom of God\u201d (John 3: 5). It is not a low [368]\nstandard that is placed before us; for we are to become the children\nof God. We are to be saved as individuals; and in the day of test and\ntrial we shall be able to discern between him that serveth God and\nhim that serveth Him not. We are saved as individual believers in\nthe Lord Jesus Christ.\nMany are losing the right way, in consequence of thinking that\nthey must climb to heaven, that they must do something to merit the\nfavor of God. They seek to make themselves better by their own\nunaided efforts. This they can never accomplish. Christ has made\nthe way by dying our sacrifice, by living our example, by becoming\nour great high priest. He declares, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the\nlife\u201d (John 14:6). If by an effort of our own we could advance one\nstep toward the ladder, the words of Christ would not be true. But\nwhen we accept Christ, good works will appear as fruitful evidence\nthat we are in the way of life, that Christ is our way, and that we are\ntreading the true path that leads to heaven.\n340 Selected Messages Book 1\nHe Becomes Our Righteousness\nChrist looks at the spirit, and when He sees us carrying our\nburden with faith, His perfect holiness atones for our shortcomings.\nWhen we do our best, He becomes our righteousness. It takes every\nray of light that God sends to us to make us the light of the world.\u2014\nLetter 22, 1889. [Originally listed as letter 33, this reference has\nbeen reclassified as Letter 22, 1889.]\nChapter 58\u2014\u201cThou Hast Left Thy First Love\u201d [369]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[Portion of a sermon at Otsego, Michigan, October 10, 1890,\nprinted in The Review and Herald, February 3, 1891.]\nI spoke to the people of Otsego from the fourth and fifth verses\nof the second chapter of Revelation: \u201cI have somewhat against thee,\nbecause thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from\nwhence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else\nI will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out\nof his place, except thou repent\u201d(Revelation 2:4, 5). The people\nto whom these words are addressed have many excellent qualities,\nwhich are recognized by the True Witness; \u201cNevertheless,\u201d He says,\n\u201cI have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.\u201d\nHere is a want that will have to be supplied. All the other graces fail\nto make up the deficiency. The church is counseled to \u201cremember\ntherefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first\nworks; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy\ncandlestick out of his place, except thou repent.... He that hath an\near, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that\novercometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst [370]\nof the paradise of God\u201d (Revelation 2:4-7).\nIn these words are warnings, reproofs, threatenings, promises,\nfrom the True Witness, He that holdeth the seven stars in His right\nhand. \u201cThe seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and\nthe seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches\u201d\n(Revelation 1:20).\nWhen this church is weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, it is\nfound wanting, having left its first love. The True Witness declares,\n\u201cI know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou\ncanst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which\nsay they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: and\n341\n342 Selected Messages Book 1\nhast borne, and hast patience, and for my name\u2019s sake hast laboured,\nand hast not fainted\u201d (Revelation 2:2, 3). Notwithstanding all this,\nthe church is found wanting. What is the fatal deficiency?\u2014\u201cThou\nhast left thy first love.\u201d Is not this our case? Our doctrines may be\ncorrect; we may hate false doctrine, and may not receive those who\nare not true to principle; we may labor with untiring energy; but\neven this is not sufficient. What is our motive? Why are we called\nupon to repent?\u2014\u201cThou hast left thy first love.\u201d\nLet each member of the church study this important warning and\nreproof. Let each one see if in contending for the truth, if in debating\non the theory, he has not lost the tender love of Christ. Has not Christ\nbeen left out of the sermons, and out of the heart? Is there not danger\nthat many are going forward with a profession of the truth, doing\nmissionary work, while the love of Christ has not been woven into\nthe labor? This solemn warning from the True Witness means much;\nit demands that you shall remember from whence you are fallen, and\nrepent, and do the first works; \u201cor else,\u201d says the True Witness, \u201cI\nwill come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of\nhis place, except thou repent\u201d (Revelation 2:5). O that the church\nmight realize its need of its first ardor of love! When this is wanting,\nall other excellences are insufficient. The call to repentance is one\nthat cannot be disregarded without peril. A belief in the theory of\nthe truth is not enough. To present this theory to unbelievers does[371]\nnot constitute you a witness for Christ. The light that gladdened\nyour heart when you first understood the message for this time, is an\nessential element in your experience and labors, and this has been\nlost out of your heart and life. Christ beholds your lack of zeal, and\ndeclares that you have fallen, and are in a perilous position.\nPresent Love and Law Together\nIn presenting the binding claims of the law, many have failed\nto portray the infinite love of Christ. Those who have so great\ntruths, so weighty reforms to present to the people, have not had a\nrealization of the value of the atoning Sacrifice as an expression of\nGod\u2019s great love to man. Love for Jesus, and Jesus\u2019 love for sinners,\nhave been dropped out of the religious experience of those who have\nbeen commissioned to preach the gospel, and self has been exalted\n\u201cThou Hast Left Thy First Love\u201d 343\ninstead of the Redeemer of mankind. The law is to be presented\nto its transgressors, not as something apart from God, but rather as\nan exponent of His mind and character. As the sunlight cannot be\nseparated from the sun, so God\u2019s law cannot be rightly presented to\nman apart from the divine Author. The messenger should be able to\nsay, \u201cIn the law is God\u2019s will; come, see for yourselves that the law is\nwhat Paul declared it to be\u2014\u2018holy, and just, and good.\u2019\u201d It reproves\nsin, it condemns the sinner, but it shows him his need of Christ, with\nwhom is plenteous mercy and goodness and truth. Though the law\ncannot remit the penalty for sin, but charges the sinner with all his\ndebt, Christ has promised abundant pardon to all who repent, and\nbelieve in His mercy. The love of God is extended in abundance\nto the repenting, believing soul. The brand of sin upon the soul\ncan be effaced only through the blood of the atoning Sacrifice. No\nless an offering was required than the sacrifice of Him who was\nequal with the Father. The work of Christ\u2014His life, humiliation,\ndeath, and intercession for lost man\u2014magnifies the law, and makes\nit honorable.\nMany sermons preached upon the claims of the law have been\nwithout Christ, and this lack has made the truth inefficient in con- [372]\nverting souls. Without the grace of Christ it is impossible to take\none step in obedience to the law of God. Then how necessary that\nthe sinner hear of the love and power of his Redeemer and Friend!\nWhile the ambassador for Christ should plainly declare the claims\nof the law, he should make it understood that none can be justified\nwithout the atoning sacrifice of Christ. Without Christ there can\nbe only condemnation and a fearful looking for a fiery indignation,\nand final separation from the presence of God. But he whose eyes\nhave been opened to see the love of Christ, will behold the character\nof God as full of love and compassion. God will not appear as a\ntyrannical, relentless being, but as a father longing to embrace his\nrepenting son. The sinner will cry with the psalmist, \u201cLike as a\nfather pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear him\u201d\n(Psalm 103:13). All despair is swept from the soul when Christ is\nseen in His true character.\n344 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe Third Angel\u2019s Message in Verity\nSome of our brethren have expressed fears that we shall dwell\ntoo much upon the subject of justification by faith, but I hope and\npray that none will be needlessly alarmed; for there is no danger in\npresenting this doctrine as it is set forth in the Scriptures. If there\nhad not been a remissness in the past to properly instruct the people\nof God, there would not now be a necessity of calling a special\nattention to it.. . . The exceeding great and precious promises given\nus in the Holy Scriptures have been lost sight of to a great extent,\njust as the enemy of all righteousness designed that they should be.\nHe has cast his own dark shadow between us and our God, that we\nmay not see the true character of God. The Lord has proclaimed\nHimself to be \u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant\nin goodness and truth.\u201d\nSeveral have written to me, inquiring if the message of justifica-\ntion by faith is the third angel\u2019s message, and I have answered, \u201cIt\nis the third angel\u2019s message, in verity.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald,\nApril 1, 1890.\nChapter 59\u2014Perfect Obedience Through Christ [373]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, November 1,\n1892.]\n\u201cYe see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by\nfaith only.... For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith\nwithout works is dead also\u201d (James 2:24-26). It is essential to have\nfaith in Jesus, and to believe you are saved through Him; but there\nis danger in taking the position that many do take in saying, \u201cI am\nsaved.\u201d Many have said: \u201cYou must do good works, and you will\nlive\u201d; but apart from Christ no one can do good works. Many at the\npresent day say, \u201cBelieve, only believe, and live.\u201d Faith and works\ngo together, believing and doing are blended. The Lord requires\nno less of the soul now, than He required of Adam in Paradise\nbefore he fell\u2014perfect obedience, unblemished righteousness. The\nrequirement of God under the covenant of grace is just as broad\nas the requirement He made in Paradise\u2014harmony with His law,\nwhich is holy, and just, and good. The gospel does not weaken the\nclaims of the law; it exalts the law and makes it honorable. Under\nthe New Testament, no less is required than was required under the\nOld Testament. Let no one take up with the delusion so pleasant to [374]\nthe natural heart, that God will accept of sincerity, no matter what\nmay be the faith, no matter how imperfect may be the life. God\nrequires of His child perfect obedience.\nIn order to meet the requirements of the law, our faith must\ngrasp the righteousness of Christ, accepting it as our righteousness.\nThrough union with Christ, through acceptance of His righteousness\nby faith, we may be qualified to work the works of God, to be\ncolaborers with Christ. If you are willing to drift along with the\ncurrent of evil, and do not cooperate with the heavenly agencies in\nrestraining transgression in your family, and in the church, in order\n345\n346 Selected Messages Book 1\nthat everlasting righteousness may be brought in, you do not have\nfaith. Faith works by love and purifies the soul. Through faith the\nHoly Spirit works in the heart to create holiness therein; but this\ncannot be done unless the human agent will work with Christ. We\ncan be fitted for heaven only through the work of the Holy Spirit upon\nthe heart; for we must have Christ\u2019s righteousness as our credentials\nif we would find access to the Father. In order that we may have\nthe righteousness of Christ, we need daily to be transformed by the\ninfluence of the Spirit, to be a partaker of the divine nature. It is the\nwork of the Holy Spirit to elevate the taste, to sanctify the heart, to\nennoble the whole man.\nLook to Jesus\nLet the soul look to Jesus. \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29). No one will be forced\nto look to Christ; but the voice of invitation is sounding in yearning\nentreaty, \u201cLook and live.\u201d In looking to Christ, we shall see that His\nlove is without a parallel, that He has taken the place of the guilty\nsinner, and has imputed unto him His spotless righteousness. When\nthe sinner sees his Saviour dying upon the cross under the curse of\nsin in his stead, beholding His pardoning love, love awakes in his\nheart. The sinner loves Christ, because Christ has first loved him,\nand love is the fulfilling of the law. The repenting soul realizes that[375]\nGod \u201cis faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us\nfrom all unrighteousness.\u201d The Spirit of God works in the believer\u2019s\nsoul, enabling him to advance from one line of obedience to another,\nreaching on from strength to greater strength, from grace to grace in\nJesus Christ.\nGod justly condemns all who do not make Christ their personal\nSaviour; but He pardons every soul who comes to Him in faith, and\nenables him to work the works of God, and through faith to be one\nwith Christ. Jesus says of these, \u201cI in them, and thou in me, that\nthey may be made perfect in one [this unity brings perfection of\ncharacter]; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and\nhast loved them, as thou hast loved me\u201d (John 17:23). The Lord has\nmade every provision whereby man may have full and free salvation,\nand be complete in Him. God designs that His children shall have\nPerfect Obedience Through Christ 347\nthe bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness, that all may have the\nlight of truth. God has provided salvation for the world at infinite\ncost, even through the gift of His only-begotten Son. The apostle\nasks, \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for\nus all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?\u201d\n(Romans 8:32). Then if we are not saved, the fault will not be on the\npart of God, but on our part, that we have failed to cooperate with\nthe divine agencies. Our will has not coincided with God\u2019s will.\nThe Redeemer of the world clothed His divinity with humanity,\nthat He might reach humanity; for it took the divine and the human\nto bring into the world the salvation that was needed by fallen man.\nDivinity needed humanity that humanity might afford a channel of\ncommunication between God and man. Man needs a power out of\nand above himself to restore him to the likeness of God; but because\nhe needs divine aid, it does not make human activity unessential.\nFaith on the part of man is required; for faith works by love and\npurifies the soul. Faith lays hold upon the virtue of Christ. The\nLord does not design that human power should be paralyzed; but [376]\nby cooperating with God, the power of man may be efficient for\ngood. God does not design that our will should be destroyed; for it\nis through this very attribute that we are to accomplish the work He\nwould have us to do both at home and abroad. He has given to every\nman his work; and every true worker sheds forth light to the world,\nbecause he is united with God and Christ and heavenly angels in the\ngrand work of saving the lost. From divine association he becomes\nmore and more intelligent in working the works of God. In working\nout what divine grace works in, the believer becomes spiritually\ngreat. He who works according to his entrusted ability will become\na wise builder for the Master; for he is under the apprenticeship to\nChrist, learning to work the works of God. He will not shun burdens\nof responsibility, for he will realize that each one must lift in the\ncause of God to the extent of his ability, and he places himself under\nthe pressure of the work; but Jesus does not leave His willing and\nobedient servant to be crushed. It is not the man who carries heavy\nresponsibilities in the cause of God who needs your pity, for he is\nfaithful and true in cooperation with God; and through union of\ndivine and human effort, the work is made complete. It is he who\n348 Selected Messages Book 1\nshuns responsibilities, who has no realization of the privilege to\nwhich he is called, who is an object of pity.\nChapter 60\u2014Relation of Faith and Works [377]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, The Church, No. 5.]\nNapier, New Zealand\nApril 9, 1893\nBrother A. T. Jones,\nI was attending a meeting, and a large congregation were present.\nIn my dream you were presenting the subject of faith and the im-\nputed righteousness of Christ by faith. You repeated several times\nthat works amounted to nothing, that there were no conditions. The\nmatter was presented in that light that I knew minds would be con-\nfused, and would not receive the correct impression in reference to\nfaith and works, and I decided to write to you. You state this matter\ntoo strongly. There are conditions to our receiving justification and\nsanctification, and the righteousness of Christ. I know your meaning,\nbut you leave a wrong impression upon many minds. While good\nworks will not save even one soul, yet it is impossible for even one\nsoul to be saved without good works. God saves us under a law, that\nwe must ask if we would receive, seek if we would find, and knock\nif we would have the door opened unto us.\nChrist offers Himself as willing to save unto the uttermost all [378]\nwho come unto Him. He invites all to come to Him. \u201cHim that\ncometh to me I will in no wise cast out\u201d (John 6:37). You look in\nreality upon these subjects as I do, yet you make these subjects,\nthrough your expressions, confusing to minds. And after you have\nexpressed your mind radically in regard to works, when questions\nare asked you upon this very subject, it is not lying out in so very\nclear lines, in your own mind, and you cannot define the correct\nprinciples to other minds, and you are yourself unable to make your\nstatements harmonize with your own principles and faith.\nThe young man came to Jesus with the question, \u201cGood Master,\nwhat shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?\u201d (Mark 10:17). And\n349\n350 Selected Messages Book 1\nChrist saith unto him, \u201cWhy callest thou me good? there is none\ngood but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep\nthe commandments.\u201d He saith unto Him, \u201cWhich?\u201d Jesus quoted\nseveral, and the young man said unto Him, \u201cAll these things have I\nkept from my youth up: what lack I yet?\u201d Jesus said unto him, \u201cIf\nthou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.\u201d\nHere are conditions, and the Bible is full of conditions. \u201cBut when\nthe young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he\nhad great possessions\u201d (Matthew 19:17, 20, 21, 22).\nPoints to Guard\nThen when you say there are no conditions, and some expres-\nsions are made quite broad, you burden the minds, and some cannot\nsee consistency in your expressions. They cannot see how they can\nharmonize these expressions with the plain statements of the Word\nof God. Please guard these points. These strong assertions in regard\nto works never make our position any stronger. The expressions\nweaken our position, for there are many who will consider you an\nextremist, and will lose the rich lessons you have for them upon the\nvery subjects they need to know.... My brother, it is hard for the\nmind to comprehend this point, and do not confuse any mind with[379]\nideas that will not harmonize with the Word. Please to consider that\nunder the teaching of Christ many of the disciples were lamentably\nignorant; but when the Holy Spirit that Jesus promised came upon\nthem and made the vacillating Peter the champion of faith, what a\ntransformation in his character! But do not lay one pebble, for a soul\nthat is weak in the faith to stumble over, in overwrought presenta-\ntions or expressions. Be ever consistent, calm, deep, and solid. Do\nnot go to any extreme in anything, but keep your feet on solid rock.\nO precious, precious Saviour. \u201cHe that hath my commandments,\nand keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall\nbe loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself\nto him\u201d (John 14:21).\nThis is the true test\u2014the doing of the words of Christ. And it is\nthe evidence of the human agent\u2019s love to Jesus, and he that doeth\nRelation of Faith and Works 351\nHis will giveth to the world the practical evidence of the fruit he\nmanifests in obedience, in purity, and in holiness of character....\nO my brother, walk carefully with God. But remember that there\nare some whose eyes are intently fixed upon you, expecting that you\nwill overreach the mark, and stumble, and fall. But if you keep in\nhumility close to Jesus, all is well....\nThere is no place in the school of Christ where we graduate. We\nare to work on the plan of addition, and the Lord will work on the\nplan of multiplication. It is through constant diligence that we will,\nthrough the grace of Christ, live on the plan of addition, making our\ncalling and election sure.... \u201cFor if ye do these things ye shall never\nfall: for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into\nthe everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ\u201d (2\nPeter 1:10, 11).\u2014Letter 44, 1893.\nNo Compromise With Sin\nLet my brethren be very careful how they present the subject of\nfaith and works before the people, lest minds become confused. The [380]\npeople need to be urged to diligence in good works. They should be\nshown how to be successful, how to be purified, and their offerings\nmay be fragrant before God. It is by virtue of the blood of Christ.\nMessages of a decided character must be borne to the people. Men\nmust go forth reproving, rebuking every manner of evil.\nIf there is given to the angel of any church a commission like\nunto that given to the angel of the church of Ephesus, let the message\nbe heard through human agents rebuking carelessness, backsliding,\nand sin, that the people may be brought to repentance and confession\nof sin. Never seek to cover sin; for in the message of rebuke, Christ\nis to be proclaimed as the first and the last, He who is all in all to\nthe soul.\nHis power awaits the demand of those who would overcome.\nThe reprover is to animate his hearers so that they shall strive for the\nmastery. He is to encourage them to struggle for deliverance from\nevery sinful practice, to be free from every corrupt habit, even if his\ndenial of self is like taking the right eye, or separating the right arm\nfrom the body. No concession or compromise is to be made to evil\nhabits or sinful practices.\u2014Manuscript 26a, 1892.\n352 Selected Messages Book 1\nCooperation With God\nMan is to cooperate with God, employing every power according\nto his God-given ability.

The\nLord designs that His human agents shall act as rational, accountable\nbeings in every respect....\nWe cannot afford to neglect one ray of light God has given. To\nbe sluggish in our practice of those things which require diligence\nis to commit sin. The human agent is to cooperate with God, and\nkeep under those passions which should be in subjection. To do this\nhe must be unwearied in his prayers to God, ever obtaining grace to\ncontrol his spirit, temper, and actions. Through the imparted grace\nof Christ, he may be enabled to overcome. To be an overcomer[381]\nmeans more than many suppose it means.\nThe Spirit of God will answer the cry of every penitent heart; for\nrepentance is the gift of God, and an evidence that Christ is drawing\nthe soul to Himself. We can no more repent of sin without Christ,\nthan we can be pardoned without Christ, and yet it is a humiliation\nto man with his human passion and pride to go to Jesus straightway,\nbelieving and trusting Him for everything which he needs....\nLet no man present the idea that man has little or nothing to\ndo in the great work of overcoming; for God does nothing for man\nwithout his cooperation. Neither say that after you have done all\nyou can on your part, Jesus will help you. Christ has said, \u201cWithout\nme ye can do nothing\u201d (John 15:5). From first to last man is to be a\nlaborer together with God. Unless the Holy Spirit works upon the\nhuman heart, at every step we shall stumble and fall. Man\u2019s efforts\nalone are nothing but worthlessness; but cooperation with Christ\nmeans a victory. Of ourselves we have no power to repent of sin.\nUnless we accept divine aid we cannot take the first step toward the\nSaviour. He says, \u201cI am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the\nend\u201d (Revelation 21:6) in the salvation of every soul.\nBut though Christ is everything, we are to inspire every man to\nunwearied diligence. We are to strive, wrestle, agonize, watch, pray,\nlest we shall be overcome by the wily foe. For the power and grace\nwith which we can do this comes from God, and all the while we are\nto trust in Him, who is able to save to the uttermost all who come\nRelation of Faith and Works 353\nunto God by Him. Never leave the impression on the mind that there\nis little or nothing to do on the part of man; but rather teach man to\ncooperate with God, that he may be successful in overcoming.\nLet no one say that your works have nothing to do with your rank\nand position before God. In the judgment the sentence pronounced\nis according to what has been done or to what has been left undone\n(Matthew 25:34-40).\nEffort and labor are required on the part of the receiver of God\u2019s [382]\ngrace; for it is the fruit that makes manifest what is the character\nof the tree. Although the good works of man are of no more value\nwithout faith in Jesus than was the offering of Cain, yet covered with\nthe merit of Christ, they testify [to] the worthiness of the doer to\ninherit eternal life.

All the habits of his life will be brought into harmony with\nthe requirements of the Word of truth, and he will not only believe,\nbut will work out his own salvation with fear and trembling, while\nsubmitting to the molding of the Holy Spirit.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, March 6, 1888.\nJesus Accepts Our Intentions\nWhen it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth\nto this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man\u2019s best\nservice, and He makes up for the deficiency with His own divine\nmerit. But He will not accept those who claim to have faith in\nHim, and yet are disloyal to His Father\u2019s commandment. We hear a\ngreat deal about faith, but we need to hear a great deal more about\nworks. Many are deceiving their own souls by living an easygoing,\naccommodating, crossless religion. But Jesus says, \u201cIf any man\nwill come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and\nfollow me.\u201d\u2014The Signs of the Times, June 16, 1890.\nChapter 61\u2014Christ the Center of the Message[383]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, March 20, 1894.]\nThe third angel\u2019s message calls for the presentation of the Sab-\nbath of the fourth commandment, and this truth must be brought\nbefore the world; but the great center of attraction, Jesus Christ, must\nnot be left out of the third angel\u2019s message. By many who have been\nengaged in the work for this time, Christ has been made secondary,\nand theories and arguments have had first place. The glory of God\nthat was revealed to Moses in regard to the divine character has not\nbeen made prominent. The Lord said to Moses, \u201cI will make all my\ngoodness pass before thee\u201d (Exodus 33:19). \u201cAnd the Lord passed\nby before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful\nand gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,\nkeeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression\nand sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty\u201d (Exodus 34:6,\n7).\nA veil has seemed to be before the eyes of many who have\nlabored in the cause, so that when they presented the law, they have\nnot had views of Jesus, and have not proclaimed the fact that, where[384]\nsin abounded, grace doth much more abound. It is at the cross of\nCalvary that mercy and truth meet together, where righteousness and\npeace kiss each other. The sinner must ever look toward Calvary;\nand with the simple faith of a little child, he must rest in the merits\nof Christ, accepting His righteousness and believing in His mercy.\nLaborers in the cause of truth should present the righteousness of\nChrist, not as new light but as precious light that has for a time been\nlost sight of by the people. We are to accept Christ as our personal\nSaviour, and He imputes unto us the righteousness of God in Christ.\nLet us repeat and make prominent the truth that John has portrayed:\n\u201cHerein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent\nhis Son to be the propitiation for our sins\u201d (1 John 4:10).\n354\nChrist the Center of the Message 355\nIn the love of God has been opened the most marvelous vein\nof precious truth, and the treasures of the grace of Christ are laid\nopen before the church and the world. \u201cFor God so loved the world,\nthat he gave his only begotten Son\u201d (John 3:16). What love is\nthis\u2014what marvelous, unfathomable love\u2014that would lead Christ\nto die for us while we were yet sinners! What a loss it is to the soul\nwho understands the strong claims of the law, and who yet fails to\nunderstand the grace of Christ which doth much more abound! It is\ntrue that the law of God reveals the love of God when it is preached\nas the truth in Jesus; for the gift of Christ to this guilty world must\nbe largely dwelt upon in every discourse. It is no wonder that hearts\nhave not been melted by the truth, when it has been presented in\na cold and lifeless manner. No wonder faith has staggered at the\npromises of God, when ministers and workers have failed to present\nJesus in His relation to the law of God. How often should they\nhave assured the people that \u201cHe that spared not his own Son, but\ndelivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely\ngive us all things?\u201d (Romans 8:32).\nSatan is determined that men shall not see the love of God, which\nled Him to give His only-begotten Son to save the lost race; for it is\nthe goodness of God that leads men to repentance. Oh, how shall [385]\nwe succeed in setting forth before the world the deep, precious love\nof God? In no other way can we compass it than by exclaiming,\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called the sons of God\u201d (1 John 3:1)! Let us say\nto sinners, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of\nthe world\u201d (John 1:29)! By presenting Jesus as the representative of\nthe Father, we shall be able to dispel the shadow that Satan has cast\nupon our pathway, in order that we shall not see the mercy and love\nof God\u2019s inexpressible love as manifested in Jesus Christ.\nLook at the Cross\nLook at the cross of Calvary. It is a standing pledge of the bound-\nless love, the measureless mercy, of the heavenly Father. O that all\nmight repent and do their first works. When the churches do this,\nthey will love God supremely and their neighbors as themselves.\nEphraim will not envy Judah, and Judah will not vex Ephraim. Di-\n356 Selected Messages Book 1\nvisions will then be healed, the harsh sounds of strife will no more\nbe heard in the borders of Israel. Through the grace freely given\nthem of God, all will seek to answer the prayer of Christ, that His\ndisciples should be one, even as He and the Father are one. Peace,\nlove, mercy, and benevolence will be the abiding principles of the\nsoul. The love of Christ will be the theme of every tongue, and it\nwill no more be said by the True Witness, \u201cI have somewhat against\nthee, because thou hast left thy first love\u201d (Revelation 2:4). The\npeople of God will be abiding in Christ, the love of Jesus will be\nrevealed, and one Spirit will animate all hearts, regenerating and\nrenewing all in the image of Christ, fashioning all hearts alike. As\nliving branches of the True Vine, all will be united to Christ, the\nliving head. Christ will abide in every heart, guiding, comforting,\nsanctifying, and presenting to the world the unity of the followers\nof Jesus, thus bearing testimony that the heavenly credentials are\nsupplied to the remnant church. In the oneness of Christ\u2019s church it\nwill be proved that God sent His only-begotten Son into the world.\nWhen God\u2019s people are one in the unity of the Spirit, all of[386]\nPhariseeism, all of self-righteousness, which was the sin of the\nJewish nation, will be expelled from all hearts. The mold of Christ\nwill be upon each individual member of His body, and His people\nwill be new bottles into which He can pour His new wine, and the\nnew wine will not break the bottles. God will make known the\nmystery which hath been hidden for ages. He will make known\nwhat are the \u201criches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles;\nwhich is Christ in you, the hope of glory\u201d (Colossians 1:27) [verses\n28, 29 also quoted].\nJesus came to impart to the human soul the Holy Spirit, by which\nthe love of God is shed abroad in the heart; but it is impossible to\nendow men with the Holy Spirit, who are set in their ideas, whose\ndoctrines are all stereotyped and unchangeable, who are walking\nafter the traditions and commandments of men, as were the Jews in\nthe time of Christ. They were very punctilious in the observances\nof the church, very rigorous in following their forms, but they were\ndestitute of vitality and religious devotion. They were represented\nby Christ as like the dry skins which were then used as bottles.\nThe gospel of Christ could not be placed in their hearts; for there\nwas no room to contain it. They could not be the new bottles into\nChrist the Center of the Message 357\nwhich He could pour His new wine. Christ was obliged to seek\nelsewhere than among the scribes and the Pharisees for bottles for\nHis doctrine of truth and life. He must find men who were willing\nto have regeneration of heart. He came to give to men new hearts.\nHe said, \u201cA new heart also will I give you.\u201d But the self-righteous of\nthat day and of this day feel no need of having a new heart. Jesus\npassed by the scribes and the Pharisees, for they felt no need of\na Saviour. They were wedded to forms and ceremonies. These\nservices had been instituted by Christ; they had been full of vitality\nand spiritual beauty; but the Jews had lost the spiritual life from\ntheir ceremonies, and clung to the dead forms after spiritual life was\nextinct among them. When they departed from the requirements and\ncommandments of God, they sought to supply the place of that which [387]\nthey had lost, by multiplying their own requirements, and making\nmore rigorous demands than had God; and the more rigid they grew,\nthe less of the love and Spirit of God they manifested. Christ said\nto the people: \u201cThe scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses\u2019 seat:\nall therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do;\nbut do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not. For they\nbind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men\u2019s\nshoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their\nfingers. But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make\nbroad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,\nand love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in the\nsynagogues, and greetings in the markets, and to be called of men,\nRabbi, Rabbi.\u201d \u201cWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!\nfor ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted\nthe weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these\nought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone\u201d (Matthew\n23:2-7, 23).\nThe remnant church is called to go through an experience similar\nto that of the Jews; and the True Witness, who walks up and down in\nthe midst of the seven golden candlesticks, has a solemn message to\nbear to His people. He says, \u201cI have somewhat against thee, because\nthou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou\nart fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto\nthee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except\nthou repent\u201d (Revelation 2:4, 5). The love of God has been waning\n358 Selected Messages Book 1\nin the church, and as a result, the love of self has sprung up into new\nactivity. With the loss of love for God there has come the loss of\nlove for the brethren. The church may meet all the description that is\ngiven of the Ephesian church, and yet fail in vital godliness. Of them\nJesus said, \u201cI know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and\nhow thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried\nthem which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them\nliars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name\u2019s sake[388]\nhast laboured, and hast not fainted. Nevertheless I have somewhat\nagainst thee, because thou hast left thy first love\u201d (Revelation 2:2-4).\nA legal religion has been thought quite the correct religion for\nthis time. But it is a mistake. The rebuke of Christ to the Pharisees\nis applicable to those who have lost from the heart their first love. A\ncold, legal religion can never lead souls to Christ; for it is a loveless,\nChristless religion. When fastings and prayers are practiced in\na self-justifying spirit, they are abominable to God. The solemn\nassembly for worship, the round of religious ceremonies, the external\nhumiliation, the imposed sacrifice\u2014all proclaim to the world the\ntestimony that the doer of these things considers himself righteous.\nThese things call attention to the observer of rigorous duties, saying,\nThis man is entitled to heaven. But it is all a deception. Works will\nnot buy for us an entrance into heaven. The one great Offering that\nhas been made is ample for all who will believe. The love of Christ\nwill animate the believer with new life. He who drinks from the\nwater of the fountain of life, will be filled with the new wine of the\nkingdom. Faith in Christ will be the means whereby the right spirit\nand motive will actuate the believer, and all goodness and heavenly-\nmindedness will proceed from him who looks unto Jesus, the author\nand finisher of his faith. Look up to God, look not to men. God\nis your heavenly Father who is willing patiently to bear with your\ninfirmities, and to forgive and heal them. \u201cThis is life eternal, that\nthey might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom\nthou hast sent\u201d (John 17:3). By beholding Christ, you will become\nchanged, until you will hate your former pride, your former vanity\nand self-esteem, your self-righteousness and unbelief. You will cast\nthese sins aside as a worthless burden, and walk humbly, meekly,\ntrustfully, before God. You will practice love, patience, gentleness,\nChrist the Center of the Message 359\ngoodness, mercy, and every grace that dwells in the child of God,\nand will at last find a place among the sanctified and holy.\nChapter 62\u2014Justified by Faith[389]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[This article appeared in The Bible Students\u2019 Library Series, April,\n1893.]\nWhen God pardons the sinner, remits the punishment he de-\nserves, and treats him as though he had not sinned, He receives him\ninto divine favor, and justifies him through the merits of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness. The sinner can be justified only through faith in the\natonement made through God\u2019s dear Son, who became a sacrifice\nfor the sins of the guilty world. No one can be justified by any works\nof his own. He can be delivered from the guilt of sin, from the\ncondemnation of the law, from the penalty of transgression, only by\nvirtue of the suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ. Faith is the\nonly condition upon which justification can be obtained, and faith\nincludes not only belief but trust.\nMany have a nominal faith in Christ, but they know nothing\nof that vital dependence upon Him which appropriates the merits\nof a crucified and risen Saviour. Of this nominal faith James says:\n\u201cThou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils\nalso believe, and tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that\nfaith without works is dead? (James 2:19, 20). Many concede\nthat Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the world, but at the same time[390]\nthey hold themselves away from Him, and fail to repent of their\nsins, fail to accept of Jesus as their personal Saviour. Their faith\nis simply the assent of the mind and judgment to the truth; but the\ntruth is not brought into the heart, that it might sanctify the soul\nand transform the character. \u201cFor whom he did foreknow, he also\ndid predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he\nmight be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover whom he\ndid predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them\nhe also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified\u201d\n360\nJustified by Faith 361\n(Romans 8:29, 30). Calling and justification are not one and the\nsame thing. Calling is the drawing of the sinner to Christ, and it is a\nwork wrought by the Holy Spirit upon the heart, convicting of sin,\nand inviting to repentance.\nMany are confused as to what constitutes the first steps in the\nwork of salvation. Repentance is thought to be a work the sinner\nmust do for himself in order that he may come to Christ. They think\nthat the sinner must procure for himself a fitness in order to obtain\nthe blessing of God\u2019s grace. But while it is true that repentance must\nprecede forgiveness, for it is only the broken and contrite heart that is\nacceptable to God, yet the sinner cannot bring himself to repentance,\nor prepare himself to come to Christ. Except the sinner repent, he\ncannot be forgiven; but the question to be decided is as to whether\nrepentance is the work of the sinner or the gift of Christ. Must the\nsinner wait until he is filled with remorse for his sin before he can\ncome to Christ? The very first step to Christ is taken through the\ndrawing of the Spirit of God; as man responds to this drawing, he\nadvances toward Christ in order that he may repent.\nThe sinner is represented as a lost sheep, and a lost sheep never\nreturns to the fold unless he is sought after and brought back to\nthe fold by the shepherd. No man of himself can repent, and make\nhimself worthy of the blessing of justification. The Lord Jesus is\nconstantly seeking to impress the sinner\u2019s mind and attract him to\nbehold Himself, the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the\nworld. We cannot take a step toward spiritual life save as Jesus draws [391]\nand strengthens the soul, and leads us to experience that repentance\nwhich needeth not to be repented of.\nWhen before the high priests and Sadducees, Peter clearly pre-\nsented the fact that repentance is the gift of God. Speaking of Christ,\nhe said, \u201cHim hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince\nand a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of\nsins\u201d (Acts 5:31). Repentance is no less the gift of God than are\npardon and justification, and it cannot be experienced except as it is\ngiven to the soul by Christ. If we are drawn to Christ, it is through\nHis power and virtue. The grace of contrition comes through Him,\nand from Him comes justification.\n362 Selected Messages Book 1\nThe Meaning of Faith\nPaul writes: \u201cBut the righteousness which is of faith speaketh\non this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven?\n(that is, to bring Christ down from above:) or, Who shall descend\ninto the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.) But\nwhat saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy\nheart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; that if thou shalt\nconfess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine\nheart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\nFor with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the\nmouth confession is made unto salvation\u201d (Romans 10:6-10).\nThe faith that is unto salvation is not a casual faith, it is not the\nmere consent of the intellect, it is belief rooted in the heart, that\nembraces Christ as a personal Saviour, assured that He can save unto\nthe uttermost all that come unto God by Him. To believe that He\nwill save others, but will not save you is not genuine faith; but when\nthe soul lays hold upon Christ as the only hope of salvation, then\ngenuine faith is manifested. This faith leads its possessor to place\nall the affections of the soul upon Christ; his understanding is under\nthe control of the Holy Spirit, and his character is molded after the\ndivine likeness. His faith is not a dead faith, but a faith that works by\nlove, and leads him to behold the beauty of Christ, and to become[392]\nassimilated to the divine character. [Deuteronomy 30:11-14 quoted.]\n\u201cAnd the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of\nthy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all\nthy soul, that thou mayest live\u201d (Deuteronomy 30:6).\nIt is God that circumcises the heart. The whole work is the\nLord\u2019s from the beginning to the end. The perishing sinner may say:\n\u201cI am a lost sinner; but Christ came to seek and to save that which\nwas lost. He says, \u2018I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to\nrepentance\u2019 (Mark 2:17). I am a sinner, and He died upon Calvary\u2019s\ncross to save me. I need not remain a moment longer unsaved. He\ndied and rose again for my justification, and He will save me now. I\naccept the forgiveness He has promised.\u201d\nJustified by Faith 363\nImputed Righteousness\nChrist is a risen Saviour; for, though He was dead, He has\nrisen again, and ever liveth to make intercession for us. We are to\nbelieve with the heart unto righteousness, and with the mouth make\nconfession unto salvation. Those who are justified by faith will\nmake confession of Christ. \u201cHe that heareth my word, and believeth\non him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into\ncondemnation; but is passed from death unto life\u201d (John 5:24). The\ngreat work that is wrought for the sinner who is spotted and stained\nby evil is the work of justification. By Him who speaketh truth\nhe is declared righteous. The Lord imputes unto the believer the\nrighteousness of Christ and pronounces him righteous before the\nuniverse. He transfers his sins to Jesus, the sinner\u2019s representative,\nsubstitute, and surety. Upon Christ He lays the iniquity of every\nsoul that believeth. \u201cHe hath made him to be sin for us, who knew\nno sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him\u201d (2\nCorinthians 5:21).\nChrist made satisfaction for the guilt of the whole world, and\nall who will come to God in faith, will receive the righteousness of\nChrist, \u201cwho his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,\nthat we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose [393]\nstripes ye were healed\u201d (1 Peter 2:24). Our sin has been expiated,\nput away, cast into the depths of the sea. Through repentance and\nfaith we are rid of sin, and look unto the Lord our righteousness.\nJesus suffered, the just for the unjust.\nAlthough as sinners we are under the condemnation of the law,\nyet Christ by His obedience rendered to the law, claims for the\nrepentant soul the merit of His own righteousness. In order to obtain\nthe righteousness of Christ, it is necessary for the sinner to know\nwhat that repentance is which works a radical change of mind and\nspirit and action. The work of transformation must begin in the\nheart, and manifest its power through every faculty of the being; but\nman is not capable of originating such a repentance as this, and can\nexperience it alone through Christ, who ascended up on high, led\ncaptivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.\nWho is desirous of becoming truly repentant? What must he\ndo?\u2014He must come to Jesus, just as he is, without delay. He must\n364 Selected Messages Book 1\nbelieve that the word of Christ is true, and, believing the promise,\nask, that he may receive. When sincere desire prompts men to pray,\nthey will not pray in vain. The Lord will fulfill His word, and will\ngive the Holy Spirit to lead to repentance toward God and faith\ntoward our Lord Jesus Christ. He will pray and watch, and put away\nhis sins, making manifest his sincerity by the vigor of his endeavor\nto obey the commandments of God. With prayer he will mingle\nfaith, and not only believe in but obey the precepts of the law. He\nwill announce himself as on Christ\u2019s side of the question. He will\nrenounce all habits and associations that tend to draw the heart from\nGod.\nHe who would become a child of God must receive the truth that\nrepentance and forgiveness are to be obtained through nothing less\nthan the atonement of Christ. Assured of this the sinner must put\nforth an effort in harmony with the work done for him, and with\nunwearied entreaty he must supplicate the throne of grace, that the\nrenovating power of God may come into his soul. Christ pardons[394]\nnone but the penitent, but whom He pardons He first makes penitent.\nThe provision made is complete, and the eternal righteousness of\nChrist is placed to the account of every believing soul. The costly,\nspotless robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has been provided for\nthe repenting, believing sinner, and he may say: \u201cI will greatly\nrejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath\nclothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with\nthe robe of righteousness\u201d (Isaiah 61:10).\nAbundant grace has been provided that the believing soul may\nbe kept free from sin; for all heaven, with its limitless resources,\nhas been placed at our command. We are to draw from the well of\nsalvation. Christ is the end of law for righteousness to everyone who\nbelieveth. In ourselves we are sinners; but in Christ we are righteous.\nHaving made us righteous through the imputed righteousness of\nChrist, God pronounces us just, and treats us as just. He looks upon\nus as His dear children. Christ works against the power of sin, and\nwhere sin abounded, grace much more abounds. \u201cTherefore being\njustified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus\nChrist: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein\nwe stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God\u201d (Romans 5:1, 2).\nJustified by Faith 365\n\u201cBeing justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is\nin Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through\nfaith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of\nsins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say,\nat this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier\nof him which believeth in Jesus\u201d (Romans 3:24-26). \u201cFor by grace\nare ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift\nof God\u201d (Ephesians 2:8). [John 1:14-16 quoted.]\nThe Promise of the Spirit\nThe Lord would have His people sound in the faith\u2014not ignorant\nof the great salvation so abundantly provided for them. They are not\nto look forward, thinking that at some future time a great work is to [395]\nbe done for them; for the work is now complete. The believer is not\ncalled upon to make his peace with God; he never has nor ever can\ndo this. He is to accept Christ as his peace, for with Christ is God\nand peace. Christ made an end of sin, bearing its heavy curse in His\nown body on the tree, and He hath taken away the curse from all\nthose who believe in Him as a personal Saviour. He makes an end of\nthe controlling power of sin in the heart, and the life and character of\nthe believer testify to the genuine character of the grace of Christ. To\nthose that ask Him, Jesus imparts the Holy Spirit; for it is necessary\nthat every believer should be delivered from pollution, as well as\nfrom the curse and condemnation of the law. Through the work of\nthe Holy Spirit, the sanctification of the truth, the believer becomes\nfitted for the courts of heaven; for Christ works within us, and His\nrighteousness is upon us. Without this no soul will be entitled to\nheaven. We would not enjoy heaven unless qualified for its holy\natmosphere by the influence of the Spirit and the righteousness of\nChrist.\nIn order to be candidates for heaven we must meet the require-\nment of the law: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\nand with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind;\nand thy neighbour as thyself\u201d (Luke 10:27). We can do this only as\nwe grasp by faith the righteousness of Christ. By beholding Jesus we\nreceive a living, expanding principle in the heart, and the Holy Spirit\ncarries on the work, and the believer advances from grace to grace,\n366 Selected Messages Book 1\nfrom strength to strength, from character to character. He conforms\nto the image of Christ, until in spiritual growth he attains unto the\nmeasure of the full stature in Christ Jesus. Thus Christ makes an end\nof the curse of sin, and sets the believing soul free from its action\nand effect.\nChrist alone is able to do this, for \u201cin all things it behoved him to\nbe made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faith-\nful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation\nfor the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being\ntempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted\u201d (Hebrews 2:17,[396]\n18). Reconciliation means that every barrier between the soul and\nGod is removed, and that the sinner realizes what the pardoning love\nof God means. By reason of the sacrifice made by Christ for fallen\nmen, God can justly pardon the transgressor who accepts the merits\nof Christ. Christ was the channel through which the mercy, love, and\nrighteousness might flow from the heart of God to the heart of the\nsinner. \u201cHe is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse\nus from all unrighteousness\u201d (1 John 1:9).\nIn the prophecy of Daniel it was recorded of Christ that He\nshall \u201cmake reconciliation for iniquity, and ... bring in everlasting\nrighteousness\u201d (Daniel 9:24). Every soul may say: \u201cBy His perfect\nobedience He has satisfied the claims of the law, and my only hope\nis found in looking to Him as my substitute and surety, who obeyed\nthe law perfectly for me. By faith in His merits I am free from the\ncondemnation of the law. He clothes me with His righteousness,\nwhich answers all the demands of the law. I am complete in Him\nwho brings in everlasting righteousness. He presents me to God in\nthe spotless garment of which no thread was woven by any human\nagent. All is of Christ, and all the glory, honor, and majesty are to be\ngiven to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\u201d\nMany think that they must wait for a special impulse in order\nthat they may come to Christ; but it is necessary only to come in\nsincerity of purpose, deciding to accept the offers of mercy and grace\nthat have been extended to us. We are to say: \u201cChrist died to save\nme. The Lord\u2019s desire is that I should be saved, and I will come to\nJesus just as I am without delay. I will venture upon the promise. As\nChrist draws me, I will respond.\u201d The apostle says, \u201cWith the heart\nman believeth unto righteousness\u201d (Romans 10:10). No one can\nJustified by Faith 367\nbelieve with the heart unto righteousness, and obtain justification by\nfaith, while continuing the practice of those things which the Word\nof God forbids, or while neglecting any known duty.\nGood Works the Fruit of Faith [397]\nGenuine faith will be manifested in good works; for good works\nare the fruits of faith. As God works in the heart, and man surrenders\nhis will to God, and cooperates with God, he works out in the life\nwhat God works in by the Holy Spirit, and there is harmony between\nthe purpose of the heart and the practice of the life. Every sin must\nbe renounced as the hateful thing that crucified the Lord of life\nand glory, and the believer must have a progressive experience by\ncontinually doing the works of Christ. It is by continual surrender\nof the will, by continual obedience, that the blessing of justification\nis retained.\nThose who are justified by faith must have a heart to keep the\nway of the Lord. It is an evidence that a man is not justified by faith\nwhen his works do not correspond to his profession. James says,\n\u201cSeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was his\nfaith made perfect?\u201d (James 2:22).\nThe faith that does not produce good works does not justify the\nsoul. \u201cYe see then how that by works a man is justified, and not\nby faith only\u201d (James 2:24). \u201cAbraham believed God, and it was\ncounted unto him for righteousness\u201d (Romans 4:3).\nImputation of the righteousness of Christ comes through justify-\ning faith, and is the justification for which Paul so earnestly contends.\nHe says: \u201cTherefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be\njustified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But\nnow the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being\nwitnessed by the law and the prophets; even the righteousness of\nGod which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that\nbelieve: for there is no difference: for all have sinned, and come\nshort of the glory of God; being justified freely by his grace through\nthe redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be\na propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness\nfor the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of\nGod.... Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: [398]\n368 Selected Messages Book 1\nyea, we establish the law\u201d (Romans 3:20-31).\nGrace is unmerited favor, and the believer is justified without any\nmerit of his own, without any claim to offer to God. He is justified\nthrough the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, who stands in the\ncourts of heaven as the sinner\u2019s substitute and surety. But while\nhe is justified because of the merit of Christ, he is not free to work\nunrighteousness. Faith works by love and purifies the soul. Faith\nbuds and blossoms and bears a harvest of precious fruit. Where\nfaith is, good works appear. The sick are visited, the poor are cared\nfor, the fatherless and the widows are not neglected, the naked are\nclothed, the destitute are fed. Christ went about doing good, and\nwhen men are united with Him, they love the children of God, and\nmeekness and truth guide their footsteps. The expression of the\ncountenance reveals their experience, and men take knowledge of\nthem that they have been with Jesus and learned of Him. Christ and\nthe believer become one, and His beauty of character is revealed\nin those who are vitally connected with the Source of power and\nlove. Christ is the great depositary of justifying righteousness and\nsanctifying grace.\nAll may come to Him, and receive of His fullness. He says,\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will\ngive you rest\u201d (Matthew 11:28). Then why not cast aside all unbelief\nand heed the words of Jesus? You want rest; you long for peace.\nThen say from the heart, \u201cLord Jesus, I come, because Thou hast\ngiven me this invitation.\u201d Believe in Him with steadfast faith, and He\nwill save you. Have you been looking unto Jesus, who is the author\nand finisher of your faith? Have you been beholding Him who is\nfull of truth and grace? Have you accepted the peace which Christ\nalone can give? If you have not, then yield to Him, and through His\ngrace seek for a character that will be noble and elevated. Seek for a\nconstant, resolute, cheerful spirit. Feed on Christ, who is the bread\nof life, and you will manifest His loveliness of character and spirit.\nChapter 63\u2014The Pearl of Great Price [399]\nChrist Our Righteousness\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, August 8, 1899.]\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting\nlife\u201d (John 3:16). He is the same yesterday, today, and forever. The\nrighteousness of Christ, as a pure white pearl, has no defect, no\nstain, no guilt. This righteousness may be ours. Salvation, with its\nblood-bought, inestimable treasures, is the pearl of great price. It\nmay be searched for and found. But all who really find it will sell\nall they have to buy it. They give evidence that they are one with\nChrist, as He is one with the Father. In the parable the merchantman\nis represented as selling all that he had to gain possession of one\npearl of great price. This is a beautiful representation of those who\nappreciate the truth so highly that they give up all they have to come\ninto possession of it. They lay hold by faith of the salvation provided\nfor them at the sacrifice of the only-begotten Son of God.\nThere are some who are seeking, always seeking, for the goodly\npearl. But they do not make an entire surrender of their wrong habits.\nThey do not die to self that Christ may live in them. Therefore they\ndo not find the precious pearl. They have not overcome unholy [400]\nambition and their love for worldly attractions. They do not lift the\ncross, and follow Christ in the path of self-denial and self-sacrifice.\nThey never know what it is to have peace and harmony in the soul; for\nwithout entire surrender there is no rest, no joy. Almost Christians,\nyet not fully Christians, they seem near the kingdom of heaven, but\nthey do not enter therein. Almost but not wholly saved means to be\nnot almost but wholly lost.\nA daily consecration to God brings peace and rest. The merchant\nsold all that he had to possess the pearl. When those who are seeking\nfor salvation refuse to fail or be discouraged, they will find peace\n369\n370 Selected Messages Book 1\nand rest in the Lord. Christ will clothe them with His righteousness.\nHe will provide them with a clean heart and a renewed mind. These\nblessings cost the life of the Son of God, and are freely offered to\nthose for whom the sacrifice was made. But how do many treat the\nproffered gift?\u2014They turn away, choosing rather the pleasures of\nthis life. Christ says of them, \u201cYe will not come to me, that ye might\nhave life\u201d (John 5:40).\nSinners are under a fearful deception. They despise and reject\nthe Saviour. They do not realize the value of the pearl offered to\nthem, and cast it away, rendering to their Redeemer only insult and\nmockery. Many a woman decks herself with rings and bracelets,\nthinking to gain admiration, but she refuses to accept the pearl of\ngreat price, which would secure for her sanctification, honor, and\neternal riches. What an infatuation is upon the minds of many! They\nare more charmed with earthly baubles, which glitter and shine, than\nwith the crown of immortal life, God\u2019s reward for loyalty. \u201cCan a\nmaid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have\nforgotten me days without number\u201d (Jeremiah 2:32).\nChapter 64\u2014\u201cThe Darkness Comprehended It Not\u201d [401]\nFurther Light\n[This article appeared in The Review and Herald, June 3, 1890.]\n\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and\nthe Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All\nthings were made by him; and without him was not any thing made\nthat was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men.\nAnd the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it\nnot. There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. The\nsame came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men\nthrough him might believe. He was not that Light, but was sent to\nbear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth\nevery man that cometh into the world\u201d (John 1:1-9).\nThe question has been asked me, \u201cDo you think that the Lord\nhas any more light for us as a people?\u201d I answer that He has light\nthat is new to us, and yet it is precious old light that is to shine forth\nfrom the Word of truth. We have only the glimmerings of the rays\nof the light that is yet to come to us. We are not making the most\nof the light which the Lord has already given us, and thus we fail [402]\nto receive the increased light; we do not walk in light already shed\nupon us.\nWe call ourselves commandment-keeping people, but we do not\ncomprehend the exceeding breadth of the far-reaching principles of\nthe law of God; we do not understand its sacred character. Many\nwho claim to be teachers of the truth, have no real conception of\nwhat they are doing in teaching the law of God, because they do not\nhave a living knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nAs we read of Luther, Knox, and other noted Reformers, we ad-\nmire the strength, fortitude, and courage possessed by these faithful\nservants of God, and we would catch the spirit that animated them.\nWe desire to know from what source they were out of weakness\n371\n372 Selected Messages Book 1\nmade strong. Although these great men were used as instruments for\nGod, they were not faultless. They were erring men, and made great\nmistakes. We should seek to imitate their virtues, but we should not\nmake them our criterion. These men possessed rare talents to carry\nforward the work of the Reformation. They were moved upon by a\npower above themselves; but it was not the men, the instruments that\nGod used, that should be exalted and honored, but the Lord Jesus\nwho let His light and power come upon them. Let those who love\ntruth and righteousness, who gather up the hereditary trusts given to\nthese standard-bearers, praise God, the Source of all light.\nIf it should be announced that angel messengers were to open\nbefore men the treasures of the knowledge which relate to heavenly\nthings, what a stir would it create in the Christian world! The\natmosphere of heaven would be about the messengers, and how\neagerly would many listen to the words that should fall from their\nlips! Men would write books calling attention to the angels\u2019 words,\nbut a greater Being than angels has been in our world; the Lord\nHimself has come to reflect upon men the light of heaven. He has\nannounced Himself as one with the Father, full of grace and truth,\nGod manifest in the flesh.\nThe Lord Jesus, who is the image of the invisible God, gave His\nown life to save perishing man, and, oh, what light, what power, He[403]\nbrings with Him! In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead,\nbodily. What a mystery of mysteries! It is difficult for the reason\nto grasp the majesty of Christ, the mystery of redemption. The\nshameful cross has been upraised, the nails have been driven through\nHis hands and feet, the cruel spear has pierced to His heart, and the\nredemption price has been paid for the human race. The spotless\nLamb of God bore our sins in His own body upon the tree; He carried\nour sorrows.\nAn Inexhaustible Theme\nRedemption is an inexhaustible theme, worthy of our closest\ncontemplation. It passes the comprehension of the deepest thought,\nthe stretch of the most vivid imagination. Who by searching can find\nout God? The treasures of wisdom and knowledge are opened to\nall men, and were thousands of the most gifted men to devote their\n\u201cThe Darkness Comprehended It Not\u201d 373\nwhole time to setting forth Jesus always before us, studying how\nthey might portray His matchless charms, they would never exhaust\nthe subject.\nAlthough great and talented authors have made known wonderful\ntruths, and have presented increased light to the people, still in our\nday we shall find new ideas, and ample fields in which to work, for\nthe theme of salvation is inexhaustible. The work has gone forward\nfrom century to century, setting forth the life and character of Christ,\nand the love of God as manifested in the atoning sacrifice. The theme\nof redemption will employ the minds of the redeemed through all\neternity. There will be new and rich developments made manifest in\nthe plan of salvation throughout eternal ages.\nWere Jesus with us today, He would say to us as He did to His\ndisciples, \u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot\nbear them now\u201d (John 16:12). Jesus longed to open before the minds\nof His disciples deep and living truths, but their earthliness, their\nclouded, deficient comprehension made it impossible. They could\nnot be benefited with great, glorious, solemn truths. The want of\nspiritual growth closes the door to the rich rays of light that shine [404]\nfrom Christ. We shall never reach a period when there is no increased\nlight for us. The sayings of Christ were always far-reaching in their\nimport. Those who heard His teachings with their preconceived\nopinions, could not take in the meaning attached to His utterances.\nJesus was the source, the originator of truth.\nThe great themes of the Old Testament were misapprehended and\nmisinterpreted, and Christ\u2019s work was to expound the truth which\nhad not been understood by those to whom they had been given. The\nprophets had made the statements, but the spiritual import of what\nthey had written, was undiscovered by them. They did not see the\nmeaning of the truth. Jesus reproved His disciples for their slowness\nof comprehension. Many of His precious lessons were lost to them,\nbecause they did not understand the spiritual grandeur of His words.\nBut He promised that the Comforter should come, that the Spirit of\ntruth should recall these lost utterances to their minds. He gave them\nto understand that He had left with them precious jewels of truth\nwhose value they did not know.\n374 Selected Messages Book 1\nPrecious Gems in Mines of Truth\nAfter the crucifixion and the resurrection of Christ, His disciples\nlistened with wonder and amazement to His lessons of truth; for\nthey seemed as new ideas to them; but He told them, \u201cThese are the\nwords which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you Then opened\nhe their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures\u201d\n(Luke 24:44, 45). The truth is constantly unfolding and presenting\nnew features to different minds. All who dig in the mines of truth,\nwill constantly discover rich and precious gems. We are anxious that\nall who claim to believe the truth now open before us, and especially\nthose who take the responsibility of teaching the truth to others,\nshould have a clearer conception themselves of the all-important\nsignificance of the themes of the Bible.\nThose who stand in vindication of the law of God, are in a\nposition where they need much of the Spirit of God. If ministers are[405]\nwanting in meekness, if they are easily irritated when opposed, it\nis evident that they need divine enlightenment. Men must manifest\nthe grace of Christ as they labor for souls. The truth as it is in\nJesus will have altogether a different influence upon the minds of\nunbelievers, from that which it has had when presented as a theory\nor as a controversial subject.\nIf we do our very best to present the truth in its stirring character,\ncrossing the opinions and ideas of others, it will be misinterpreted,\nmisapplied, and misstated, to those who are entertaining error, in\norder to make it appear in an objectionable light. There are few to\nwhom you bring the truth, who have not been drinking of the wine\nof Babylon. It is hard for them to comprehend the truth, therefore\nthe necessity of teaching it as it is in Jesus.\nThose who claim to be lovers of truth can afford to be meek\nand lowly of heart, as was the Great Teacher. Those who have been\ndiligently working in the mines of God\u2019s Word, and have discovered\nthe precious ore in the rich veins of truth, in the divine mysteries\nthat have been hidden for ages, will exalt the Lord Jesus, the Source\nof all truth, by revealing in their characters the sanctifying power\nof what they believe. Jesus and His grace must be enshrined in the\ninner sanctuary of the soul. Then He will be revealed in words, in\n\u201cThe Darkness Comprehended It Not\u201d 375\nprayer, in exhortation, in the presentation of sacred truth, for this is\nthe great secret of spiritual success.\nWhen self is woven into our labors, then the truth we bear to\nothers does not sanctify, refine, and ennoble our own hearts; it\nwill not testify that we are fit vessels for the Master\u2019s use. It is\nonly through fervent prayer that we may hold sweet fellowship with\nJesus, and through this blessed communion the words and the spirit\nare made fragrant with the spirit of Christ. There is not a heart\nthat will not bear watching. Jesus, the precious Saviour, enjoined\nwatchfulness. The oversight of self must not be relaxed for a moment.\nThe heart must be kept with diligence, for out of it are the issues of\nlife. Watch and discipline the thoughts, that you may not sin with\nyour lips.\nChapter 65\u2014How to Meet a Controverted Point of[406]\nDoctrine\nFurther Light\n[Morning talk at Battle Creek, Michigan, January 29, 1890, which\nwas printed in The Review and Herald, February 18, 1890.]\nWe want to understand the time in which we live. We do not half\nunderstand it. We do not half take it in. My heart trembles in me\nwhen I think of what a foe we have to meet, and how poorly we are\nprepared to meet him. The trials of the children of Israel, and their\nattitude just before the first coming of Christ, have been presented\nbefore me again and again to illustrate the position of the people of\nGod in their experience before the second coming of Christ\u2014how\nthe enemy sought every occasion to take control of the minds of the\nJews, and today he is seeking to blind the minds of God\u2019s servants,\nthat they may not be able to discern the precious truth.\nWhen Christ came to our world, Satan was on the ground, and\ndisputed every inch of advance in His path from the manger to\nCalvary. Satan had accused God of requiring self-denial of the\nangels, when He knew nothing of what it meant Himself, and when\nHe would not Himself make any self-sacrifice for others. This was\nthe accusation that Satan made against God in heaven; and after the[407]\nevil one was expelled from heaven, he continually charged the Lord\nwith exacting service which He would not render Himself. Christ\ncame to the world to meet these false accusations, and to reveal\nthe Father. We cannot conceive of the humiliation He endured in\ntaking our nature upon Himself. Not that in itself it was a disgrace\nto belong to the human race, but He was the Majesty of heaven,\nthe King of glory, and He humbled Himself to become a babe and\nsuffer the wants and woes of mortals. He humbled Himself not to\nthe highest position, to be a man of riches and power, but though\nHe was rich, yet for our sake He became poor, that we through His\n376\nHow to Meet a Controverted Point of Doctrine 377\npoverty might be made rich. He took step after step in humiliation.\nHe was driven from city to city; for men would not receive the Light\nof the world. They were perfectly satisfied with their position.\nChrist had given precious gems of truth, but men had bound\nthem up in the rubbish of superstition and error. He had imparted\nto them the words of life, but they did not live by every word that\nproceeds out of the mouth of God. He saw that the world could not\nfind the word of God, for it was hidden by the traditions of men. He\ncame to place before the world the relative importance of heaven\nand earth, and put truth in its own place. Jesus alone could reveal\nthe truth which it was necessary men should know in order that they\nmight obtain salvation. He only could place it in the framework of\ntruth, and it was His work to free it from error and to set it before\nmen in its heavenly light.\nSatan was roused to oppose Him, for had he not put forth every\neffort since the Fall to make light appear darkness, and darkness\nlight? As Christ sought to place truth before the people in its proper\nrelation to their salvation, Satan worked through the Jewish leaders,\nand inspired them with enmity against the Redeemer of the world.\nThey determined to do all in their power to prevent Him from making\nan impression upon the people.\nO how Christ longed, how His heart burned, to open to the priests\nthe greater treasures of the truth! But their minds had been cast in\nsuch a mold that it was next to an impossibility to reveal to them the [408]\ntruths relating to His kingdom. The Scriptures had not been read\naright. The Jews had been looking for the advent of the Messiah, but\nthey had thought He must come in all the glory that will attend His\nsecond appearing. Because He did not come with all the majesty of\na king, they utterly refused Him. But it was not simply because He\ndid not come in splendor that they refused Him. It was because He\nwas the embodiment of purity, and they were impure. He walked\nthe earth a man of spotless integrity. Such a character in the midst\nof degradation and evil, was out of harmony with their desires, and\nHe was abused and despised. His spotless life flashed light upon\nthe hearts of men, and discovered iniquity to them in its odious\ncharacter.\nThe Son of God was assaulted at every step by the powers of\ndarkness. After His baptism He was driven of the Spirit into the\n378 Selected Messages Book 1\nwilderness, and suffered temptation for forty days. Letters have\nbeen coming in to me, affirming that Christ could not have had the\nsame nature as man, for if He had, He would have fallen under\nsimilar temptations. If He did not have man\u2019s nature, He could not\nbe our example. If He was not a partaker of our nature, He could\nnot have been tempted as man has been. If it were not possible for\nHim to yield to temptation, He could not be our helper. It was a\nsolemn reality that Christ came to fight the battles as man, in man\u2019s\nbehalf. His temptation and victory tell us that humanity must copy\nthe Pattern; man must become a partaker of the divine nature.\nDivinity and Humanity United in Christ\nIn Christ, divinity and humanity were combined. Divinity was\nnot degraded to humanity; divinity held its place, but humanity by\nbeing united to divinity withstood the fiercest test of temptation\nin the wilderness. The prince of this world came to Christ after\nHis long fast, when He was an hungered, and suggested to Him to\ncommand the stones to become bread. But the plan of God, devised\nfor the salvation of man, provided that Christ should know hunger,\nand poverty, and every phase of man\u2019s experience. He withstood[409]\nthe temptation, through the power that man may command. He laid\nhold on the throne of God, and there is not a man or woman who\nmay not have access to the same help through faith in God. Man\nmay become a partaker of the divine nature; not a soul lives who\nmay not summon the aid of Heaven in temptation and trial. Christ\ncame to reveal the source of His power, that man might never rely\non his unaided human capabilities.\nThose who would overcome must put to the tax every power of\ntheir being. They must agonize on their knees before God for divine\npower. Christ came to be our example, and to make known to us\nthat we may be partakers of the divine nature. How?\u2014By having\nescaped the corruptions that are in the world through lust. Satan did\nnot gain the victory over Christ. He did not put his foot upon the\nsoul of the Redeemer. He did not touch the head though he bruised\nthe heel. Christ, by His own example, made it evident that man may\nstand in integrity. Men may have a power to resist evil\u2014a power\nthat neither earth, nor death, nor hell can master; a power that will\nHow to Meet a Controverted Point of Doctrine 379\nplace them where they may overcome as Christ overcame. Divinity\nand humanity may be combined in them.\nIt was the work of Christ to present the truth in the framework\nof the gospel, and to reveal the precepts and principles that He had\ngiven to fallen man. Every idea He presented was His own. He\nneeded not to borrow thoughts from any, for He was the originator\nof all truth. He could present the ideas of prophets and philosophers,\nand preserve His originality; for all wisdom was His; He was the\nsource, the fountain, of all truth. He was in advance of all, and by\nHis teaching He became the spiritual leader for all ages.\nIt was Christ that spoke through Melchizedek, the priest of the\nmost high God. Melchizedek was not Christ, but he was the voice of\nGod in the world, the representative of the Father. And all through\nthe generations of the past, Christ has spoken; Christ has led His\npeople, and has been the light of the world. When God chose\nAbraham as a representative of His truth, He took him out of his [410]\ncountry, and away from his kindred, and set him apart. He desired to\nmold him after His own model. He desired to teach him according\nto His own plan. The mold of the world\u2019s teachers was not to be\nupon him. He was to be taught how to command his children and his\nhousehold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and\njudgment. This is the work that God would have us do. He would\nhave us understand how to govern our families, how to control our\nchildren, how to command our households to keep the way of the\nLord.\nJohn Called to a Special Work\nJohn was called to do a special work; he was to prepare the way\nof the Lord, to make straight His paths. The Lord did not send him\nto the school of the prophets and rabbis. He took him away from\nthe assemblies of men to the desert, that he might learn of nature\nand nature\u2019s God. God did not desire him to have the mold of the\npriests and rulers. He was called to do a special work. The Lord\ngave him his message. Did he go to the priests and rulers and ask\nif he might proclaim this message?\u2014No, God put him away from\nthem that he might not be influenced by their spirit and teaching.\nHe was the voice of one crying in the wilderness, \u201cPrepare ye the\n380 Selected Messages Book 1\nway of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\nEvery valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be\nmade low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough\nplaces plain; and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all\nflesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken\nit\u201d (Isaiah 40:3-5). This is the very message that must be given to\nour people; we are near the end of time, and the message is, Clear\nthe King\u2019s highway; gather out the stones; raise up a standard for\nthe people. The people must be awakened. It is no time now to cry\npeace and safety. We are exhorted to \u201ccry aloud, spare not, lift up\nthy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins\u201d (Isaiah 5:1).\nThe light of the glory of God shone upon our Representative,[411]\nand this fact says to us that the glory of God may shine upon us.\nWith His human arm, Jesus encircled the race, and with His divine\narm He grasped the throne of the Infinite, connecting man with God,\nand earth with heaven.\nThe light of the glory of God must fall upon us. We need the holy\nunction from on high. However intelligent, however learned a man\nmay be, he is not qualified to teach unless he has a firm hold on the\nGod of Israel. He who is connected with Heaven will do the works of\nChrist. By faith in God he will have power to move upon humanity.\nHe will seek for the lost sheep of the house of Israel. If divine power\ndoes not combine with human effort, I would not give a straw for\nall that the greatest man could do. The Holy Spirit is wanting in our\nwork. Nothing frightens me more than to see the spirit of variance\nmanifested by our brethren. We are on dangerous ground when\nwe cannot meet together like Christians, and courteously examine\ncontroverted points. I feel like fleeing from the place lest I receive\nthe mold of those who cannot candidly investigate the doctrines of\nthe Bible.\nThose who cannot impartially examine the evidences of a posi-\ntion that differs from theirs, are not fit to teach in any department\nof God\u2019s cause. What we need is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.\nWithout this, we are no more fitted to go forth to the world than were\nthe disciples after the crucifixion of their Lord. Jesus knew their\ndestitution, and told them to tarry in Jerusalem until they should be\nendowed with power from on high. Every teacher must be a learner,\nHow to Meet a Controverted Point of Doctrine 381\nthat his eyes may be anointed to see the evidences of the advancing\ntruth of God. The beams of the Sun of Righteousness must shine\ninto his own heart if he would impart light to others.\nNo one is able to explain the Scriptures without the aid of the\nHoly Spirit. But when you take up the Word of God with a humble,\nteachable heart, the angels of God will be by your side to impress you\nwith evidences of the truth. When the Spirit of God rests upon you,\nthere will be no feeling of envy or jealousy in examining another\u2019s\nposition; there will be no spirit of accusation and criticism, such as [412]\nSatan inspired in the hearts of the Jewish leaders against Christ. As\nChrist said to Nicodemus, so I say to you, \u201cYe must be born again.\u201d\n\u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d\n(John 3:7, 3). You must have the divine mold before you can discern\nthe sacred claims of the truth. Unless the teacher is a learner in the\nschool of Christ, he is not fitted to teach others.\nThe Special Work of Ellen G. White\nWe should come into a position where every difference will be\nmelted away. If I think I have light, I shall do my duty in presenting\nit. Suppose I consulted others concerning the message the Lord\nwould have me give to the people, the door might be closed so that\nthe light might not reach the ones to whom God had sent it. When\nJesus rode into Jerusalem, \u201cthe whole multitude of the disciples\nbegan to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty\nworks that they had seen; saying, Blessed be the King that cometh\nin the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\nAnd some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him,\nMaster, rebuke thy disciples. And he answered and said unto them,\nI tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would\nimmediately cry out\u201d (Luke 19:37-40).\nThe Jews tried to stop the proclamation of the message that had\nbeen predicted in the Word of God; but prophecy must be fulfilled.\nThe Lord says, \u201cBehold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before\nthe coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\u201d (Malachi 4:5).\nSomebody is to come in the spirit and power of Elijah, and when\nhe appears, men may say, \u201cYou are too earnest, you do not interpret\n382 Selected Messages Book 1\nthe Scriptures in the proper way. Let me tell you how to teach your\nmessage.\u201d\nThere are many who cannot distinguish between the work of\nGod and that of man. I shall tell the truth as God gives it to me, and\nI say now, If you continue to find fault, to have a spirit of variance,\nyou will never know the truth. Jesus said to His disciples, \u201cI have\nyet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\u201d[413]\n(John 16:12). They were not in a condition to appreciate sacred and\neternal things; but Jesus promised to send the Comforter, who would\nteach them all things, and bring all things to their remembrance,\nwhatsoever He had said unto them. Brethren, we must not put our\ndependence in man. \u201cCease ye from man, whose breath is in his\nnostrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of?\u201d (Isaiah 2:22). You\nmust hang your helpless souls upon Jesus. It does not become us\nto drink from the fountain of the valley, when there is a fountain\nin the mountain. Let us leave the lower streams; let us come to the\nhigher springs. If there is a point of truth that you do not understand,\nupon which you do not agree, investigate, compare scripture with\nscripture, sink the shaft of truth down deep into the mine of God\u2019s\nWord. You must lay yourselves and your opinions on the altar of\nGod, put away your preconceived ideas, and let the Spirit of Heaven\nguide you into all truth.\nMy brother said at one time that he would not hear anything\nconcerning the doctrine we hold, for fear he should be convinced.\nHe would not come to the meetings, or listen to the discourses; but\nhe afterward declared that he saw he was as guilty as if he had heard\nthem. God had given him an opportunity to know the truth, and He\nwould hold him responsible for this opportunity. There are many\namong us who are prejudiced against the doctrines that are now\nbeing discussed. They will not come to hear, they will not calmly\ninvestigate, but they put forth their objections in the dark. They\nare perfectly satisfied with their position. \u201cThou sayest, I am rich,\nand increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest\nnot that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and\nnaked: I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou\nmayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and\nthat the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes\nHow to Meet a Controverted Point of Doctrine 383\nwith eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I love, I rebuke and\nchasten: be zealous therefore, and repent\u201d (Revelation 3:17-19).\nThis scripture applies to those who live under the sound of the [414]\nmessage, but who will not come to hear it. How do you know but\nthat the Lord is giving fresh evidences of His truth, placing it in\na new setting, that the way of the Lord may be prepared? What\nplans have you been laying that new light may be infused through\nthe ranks of God\u2019s people? What evidence have you that God has\nnot sent light to His children? All self-sufficiency, egotism, and\npride of opinion must be put away. We must come to the feet of\nJesus, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly of heart. Jesus\ndid not teach His disciples as the rabbis taught theirs. Many of the\nJews came and listened as Christ revealed the mysteries of salvation,\nbut they came not to learn; they came to criticize, to catch Him in\nsome inconsistency, that they might have something with which to\nprejudice the people. They were content with their knowledge, but\nthe children of God must know the voice of the True Shepherd. Is\nnot this a time when it would be highly proper to fast and pray before\nGod? We are in danger of variance, in danger of taking sides on a\ncontroverted point; and should we not seek God in earnestness, with\nhumiliation of soul, that we may know what is truth?\nGo Under the Fig Tree\nNathanael heard John as he pointed to the Saviour and said,\n\u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world\u201d\n(John 1:29)! Nathanael looked at Jesus, but he was disappointed\nin the appearance of the world\u2019s Redeemer. Could He who bore\nthe marks of toil and poverty be the Messiah? Jesus was a worker;\nHe had toiled with humble workingmen, and Nathanael went away.\nBut he did not form his opinion decidedly as to what the character\nof Jesus was. He knelt down under a fig tree, inquiring of God if\nindeed this man was the Messiah. While he was there, Philip came\nand said, \u201cWe have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the\nprophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\u201d But the\nword \u201cNazareth\u201d again aroused his unbelief, and he said, \u201cCan there\nany good thing come out of Nazareth?\u201d He was full of prejudice, but\nPhilip did not seek to combat his prejudice; he simply said, \u201cCome [415]\n384 Selected Messages Book 1\nand see.\u201d When Nathanael came into the presence of Jesus, Jesus\nsaid, \u201cBehold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!\u201d Nathanael\nwas amazed. He said, \u201cWhence knowest thou me? Jesus answered\nand said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast\nunder the fig tree, I saw thee\u201d (John 1:45, 46, 47, 48).\nWould it not be well for us to go under the fig tree to plead\nwith God as to what is truth? Would not the eye of God be upon\nus as it was upon Nathanael? Nathanael believed on the Lord, and\nexclaimed, \u201cRabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of\nIsrael. Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee,\nI saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater\nthings than these. And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God\nascending and descending upon the Son of man\u201d (John 1:49-51).\nThis is what we shall see if we are connected with God. God\nwants us to depend upon Him, and not upon man. He desires us\nto have a new heart; He would give us revealings of light from the\nthrone of God. We should wrestle with every difficulty, but when\nsome controverted point is presented, are you to go to man to find\nout his opinion, and then shape your conclusions from his?\u2014No, go\nto God. Tell Him what you want; take your Bible and search as for\nhidden treasures.\nWe Do Not Go Deep Enough\nWe do not go deep enough in our search for truth. Every soul\nwho believes present truth will be brought where he will be required\nto give a reason of the hope that is in him. The people of God will be\ncalled upon to stand before kings, princes, rulers, and great men of\nthe earth, and they must know that they do know what is truth. They\nmust be converted men and women. God can teach you more in one\nmoment by His Holy Spirit than you could learn from the great men\nof the earth. The universe is looking upon the controversy that is\ngoing on upon the earth. At an infinite cost, God has provided for\nevery man an opportunity to know that which will make him wise[416]\nunto salvation. How eagerly do angels look to see who will avail\nhimself of this opportunity!\nHow to Meet a Controverted Point of Doctrine 385\nWhen a message is presented to God\u2019s people, they should not\nrise up in opposition to it; they should go to the Bible, comparing\nit with the law and the testimony, and if it does not bear this test, it\nis not true. God wants our minds to expand. He desires to put His\ngrace upon us. We may have a feast of good things every day; for\nGod can open the whole treasure of heaven to us. We are to be one\nwith Christ as He is one with the Father, and the Father will love us\nas He loves His Son. We may have the same help that Christ had, we\nmay have strength for every emergency; for God will be our front\nguard and our rearward. He will shut us in on every side, and when\nwe are brought before rulers, before the authorities of the earth, we\nneed not meditate beforehand of what we shall say. God will teach\nus in the day of our need. Now may God help us to come to the feet\nof Jesus and learn of Him, before we seek to become teachers of\nothers.\nThe Bible Our Creed\nWhen God\u2019s Word is studied, comprehended, and obeyed, a\nbright light will be reflected to the world; new truths, received and\nacted upon, will bind us in strong bonds to Jesus. The Bible, and\nthe Bible alone, is to be our creed, the sole bond of union; all who\nbow to this Holy Word will be in harmony. Our own views and\nideas must not control our efforts. Man is fallible, but God\u2019s Word\nis infallible. Instead of wrangling with one another, let men exalt\nthe Lord. Let us meet all opposition as did our Master, saying, \u201cIt is\nwritten.\u201d Let us lift up the banner on which is inscribed, The Bible\nour rule of faith and discipline.\u2014The Review and Herald, December\n15, 1885.",
