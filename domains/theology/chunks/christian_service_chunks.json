It is hoped that the selections will be found invaluable to ministers and\nleaders in all lines of church work, and will be appreciated by all men and\nwomen whose hearts have been touched by the spirit of the Great Missionary,\nand who have \u201cunderstanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do.\u201d\nGrateful acknowledgment is hereby made to the secretarial force of the\nGeneral Conference Home Missionary Department, general and local, and to\nother Christian workers, who have rendered valuable assistance in reading and\nmarking various books for this compilation, and whose suggestions and hearty\napproval have meant much in the thoroughness and completeness of the task.\nGeneral Conference Home Missionary Department\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nOverview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nAbout the Author . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nFurther Links . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nEnd User License Agreement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nChap. 1 -

God\u2019s Call to Service\nDepending on Human Agents\nAs His representatives among men, God does not choose angels who have\nnever fallen, but human beings, men of like passions with those they seek to\nsave. Christ took humanity that He might reach humanity. A divine-human\nSaviour was needed to bring salvation to the world. And to men and women\nhas been committed the sacred trust of making known \u201cthe unsearchable riches\nof Christ.\u201d\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 134.\nLook upon the touching scene. Behold the Majesty of heaven surrounded\nby the twelve whom He has chosen. He is about to set them apart for their\nwork. By these feeble agencies, through His Word and Spirit, He designs to\nplace salvation within the reach of all.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 18.\n\u201cSend men to Joppa, and call for one Simon.\u201d Thus God gave evidence\nof His regard for the gospel ministry and for His organized church. The angel\nwas not commissioned to tell Cornelius the story of the cross. A man subject,\neven as the centurion himself, to human frailties and temptations, was to be the\none to tell him of the cruci\ufb01ed and risen Saviour.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles ,\n134.\nThe angel sent to Philip could himself have done the work for the\nEthiopian, but this is not God\u2019s way of working. It is His plan that men are to\nwork for their fellow men.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 109.\n\u201cWe have this treasure,\u201d the apostle continued, \u201cin earthen vessels, that the\nexcellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.\u201d God could have\nproclaimed His truth through sinless angels, but this is not His plan. He\nchooses human beings, men compassed with in\ufb01rmity, as instruments in the\nworking out of His designs. The priceless treasure is placed in earthen vessels.\nThrough men His blessings are to be conveyed to the world. Through them\nHis glory is to shine forth into the darkness of sin. In loving ministry they are\nto meet the sinful\n7\nand the needy, and lead them to the cross. And in all their work, they are to\nascribe glory, honor, and praise to Him who is above all and over all.\u2014 The\nActs of the Apostles, 330.\nIt was the Saviour\u2019s purpose that after He ascended to heaven to become\nman\u2019s intercessor, His followers should carry on the work that He had begun.\nShall the human agent show no special interest in giving the light of the gospel\nmessage to those who sit in darkness? There are some who are willing to go\nto the ends of the earth in order to carry the light of truth to men, but God\ndemands that every soul who knows the truth shall seek to win others to the\nlove of the truth. If we are not willing to make special sacri\ufb01ces in order to\nsave souls that are ready to perish, how can we be counted worthy to enter into\nthe city of God?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:103.\nIn His wisdom the Lord brings those who are seeking for truth into touch\nwith fellow beings who know the truth. It is the plan of Heaven that those who\nhave received light shall impart it to those in darkness. Humanity, drawing its\nef\ufb01ciency from the great Source of wisdom, is made the instrumentality, the\nworking agency, through which the gospel exercises its transforming power\non mind and heart.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 134.\nGod could have reached His object in saving sinners without our aid; but\nin order for us to develop a character like Christ\u2019s, we must share in His\nwork. In order to enter into His joy,\u2014the joy of seeing souls redeemed by\nHis sacri\ufb01ce,\u2014we must participate in His labors for their redemption.\u2014 The\nDesire of Ages, 142.\nAs His representatives among men, Christ does not choose angels who\nhave never fallen, but human beings, men of like passions with those they seek\nto save. Christ took upon Himself humanity, that He might reach humanity.\nDivinity needed humanity; for it required both the divine and the human to\nbring salvation to the world. Divinity needed humanity, that humanity might\nafford a channel of communication between God and man.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 296.\n8\nWith almost impatient eagerness the angels wait for our co-operation; for\nman must be the channel to communicate with man. And when we give\nourselves to Christ in whole-hearted devotion, angels rejoice that they may\nspeak through our voices to reveal God\u2019s love.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 297.\nWe must be laborers together with God; for God will not complete His\nwork without human agencies.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 1, 1887.\nA Call to the Individual\nA distinct work is assigned to every Christian.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nAugust 2, 1904.\nGod requires every one to be a worker in His vineyard. You are to take\nup the work that has been placed in your charge, and to do it faithfully.\u2014 The\nBible Echo, June 10, 1901.\nWere every one of you a living missionary, the message for this time\nwould speedily be proclaimed in all countries, to every people and nation and\ntongue.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:438.\nEvery true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.\nHe who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life. The receiver\nbecomes a giver. The grace of Christ in the soul is like a spring in the desert,\nwelling up to refresh all, and making those who are ready to perish eager to\ndrink of the water of life.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 195.\nGod expects personal service from every one to whom He has intrusted\na knowledge of the truth for this time. Not all can go as missionaries\nto foreign lands, but all can be home missionaries in their families and\nneighborhoods.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:30.\nChrist was standing only a few steps from the heavenly throne when He\ngave His commission to His disciples. Including as missionaries all who\nshould believe on His name, He said, \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the\ngospel to every creature.\u201d God\u2019s power was to go with them.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, September 20, 1904.\n9\nTo save souls should be the life work of every one who professes Christ.\nWe are debtors to the world for the grace given us of God, for the light\nwhich has shone upon us, and for the discovered beauty and power of the\ntruth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:53.\nEverywhere there is a tendency to substitute the work of organizations for\nindividual effort. Human wisdom tends to consolidation, to centralization,\nto the building up of great churches and institutions. Multitudes leave\nto institutions and organizations the work of benevolence; they excuse\nthemselves from contact with the world, and their hearts grow cold. They\nbecome self-absorbed and unimpressible. Love for God and man dies out\nof the soul. Christ commits to His followers an individual work,\u2014a work\nthat cannot be done by proxy. Ministry to the sick and the poor, the\ngiving of the gospel to the lost, is not to be left to committees or organized\ncharities. Individual responsibility, individual effort, personal sacri\ufb01ce, is the\nrequirement of the gospel.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 147.\nEvery one who has received the divine illumination, is to brighten the\npathway of those who know not the Light of life.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 152.\nTo every one work has been allotted, and no one can be a substitute for\nanother. Each one has a mission of wonderful importance, which he cannot\nneglect or ignore, as the ful\ufb01lment of it involves the weal of some soul, and the\nneglect of it the woe of one for whom Christ died.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nDecember 12, 1893.\nWe should all be workers together with God. No idlers are acknowledged\nas His servants. The members of the church should individually feel that the\nlife and prosperity of the church are affected by their course of action.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, February 15, 1887.\nEvery soul whom Christ has rescued is called to work in His name for\nthe saving of the lost. This work had been neglected in Israel. It is not\nneglected today by those who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers?\u2014 Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons, 191.\nThere is something for every one to do. Every soul that believes the truth\nis to stand in his lot and place,\n10\nsaying, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:49.\nIt is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten the\ncoming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 69.\nHe who becomes a child of God should henceforth look upon himself as\na link in the chain let down to save the world, one with Christ in His plan\nof mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save the lost.\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 105.\nAll may \ufb01nd something to do. None need feel that there is no place where\nthey can labor for Christ. The Saviour identi\ufb01es Himself with every child of\nhumanity.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 104.\nThose who have united with the Lord in the covenant of service are under\nbonds to unite with Him in the great, grand work of soul-saving.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 7:19.\nSo vast is the \ufb01eld, so comprehensive the design, that every sancti\ufb01ed heart\nwill be pressed into service as an instrument of divine power.\u2014Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:47.\nMen are instruments in the hand of God, employed by Him to accomplish\nHis purposes of grace and mercy. Each has his part to act; to each is granted\na measure of light, adapted to the necessities of his time and suf\ufb01cient to\nenable him to perform the work which God has given him to do.\u2014 The Great\nControversy, 343.\nLong has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession of the\nwhole church, so that every one shall be working for Him according to his\nability.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 111.\nWhen He sent forth the twelve and afterward the seventy, to proclaim the\nkingdom of God, He was teaching them their duty to impart to others what He\nhad made known to them. In all His work, He was training them forindividual\nlabor, to be extended as their numbers increased, and eventually to reach to\nthe uttermost parts of the earth.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 32.\nNot upon the ordained minister only, rests the responsibility of going forth\nto ful\ufb01l this commission. Every one\n11\nwho has received Christ is called to work for the salvation of his fellow\nmen.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 110.\nThe real character of the church is measured, not by the high profession\nshe makes, not by the names enrolled upon the church book, but by what she\nis actually doing for the Master, by the number of her persevering, faithful\nworkers. Personal interest, and vigilant, individual effort will accomplish\nmore for the cause of Christ than can be wrought by sermons or creeds.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, September 6, 1881.\nWherever a church is established, all the members should engage actively\nin missionary work. They should visit every family in the neighborhood, and\nknow their spiritual condition.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:296.\nThe members of the church are not all called to labor in foreign lands,\nbut all have a part to act in the great work of giving light to the world. The\ngospel of Christ is aggressive and diffusive. In the day of God not one will be\nexcused for having been shut up to his own sel\ufb01sh interests. There is work for\nevery mind and for every hand. There is a variety of work, adapted to different\nminds and varied capabilities.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 290, 291.\nHe has intrusted you with sacred truth; Christ abiding in the individual\nmembers of the church is a well of water springing up into everlasting life.\nYou are guilty before God if you do not make every effort possible to dispense\nthis living water to others.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 291.\nWe are not, as Christians, doing one-twentieth part that we might do\nin winning souls to Christ. There is a world to be warned, and every\nsincere Christian will be a guide and an example to others in faithfulness,\nin cross-bearing, in prompt and vigorous action, in unswerving \ufb01delity to the\ncause of truth, and sacri\ufb01ces and labors to promote the cause of God.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, August 23, 1881.\nSo far as his opportunities extend, every one who has received the light\nof truth is under the same responsibility as was the prophet of Israel to whom\ncame the\n12\nword, \u201cSon of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel;\ntherefore thou shalt hear the word at My mouth, and warn them from\nMe.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:19, 20.\nTo every one who becomes a partaker of His grace, the Lord appoints a\nwork for others. Individually we are to stand in our lot and place, saying,\n\u201cHere I am; send me.\u201d Upon the minister of the word, the missionary nurse,\nthe Christian physician, the individual Christian, whether he be merchant or\nfarmer, professional man or mechanic,\u2014the responsibility rests upon all. It is\nour work to reveal to men the gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in\nwhich we engage should be a means to this end.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing ,\n148.\nWhen the master of the house called his servants, he gave to every man\nhis work. The whole family of God are included in the responsibility of using\ntheir Lord\u2019s goods. Every individual, from the lowest and most obscure to the\ngreatest and most exalted, is a moral agent endowed with abilities for which\nhe is accountable to God.\u2014 The Bible Echo, June 10, 1901.\nCombined Christian Forces\nBrethren and sisters in the faith, does the question arise in your hearts,\n\u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d If you claim to be children of God, you are your\nbrother\u2019s keeper. The Lord holds the church responsible for the souls of those\nwhom they might be the means of saving.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 291.\nThe Saviour has given His precious life in order to establish a church\ncapable of ministering to the suffering, the sorrowful, and the tempted. A\ncompany of believers may be poor, uneducated, and unknown; yet in Christ\nthey may do a work in the home, in the community, and even in the \u201cregions\nbeyond,\u201d whose results shall be as far-reaching as eternity.\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 106.\nEnfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one object upon\nwhich God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard. It is the theater of\nHis grace,\n13\nin which He delights to reveal His power to transform hearts.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 12.\nSome one must ful\ufb01l the commission of Christ; some one must carry on\nthe work which He began to do on earth; and the church has been given this\nprivilege. For this purpose it has been organized. Why, then, have not church\nmembers accepted the responsibility?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:295.\nHe calls upon the church to take up their appointed duty, holding up\nthe standard of true reform in their own territory, leaving the trained and\nexperienced workers to press on into new \ufb01elds.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:292.\nThe Thessalonian believers were true missionaries.... Hearts were won by\nthe truths presented, and souls were added to the number of believers.\u2014 The\nActs of the Apostles, 256.\nIt was at the ordination of the twelve that the \ufb01rst step was taken in the\norganization of the church that after Christ\u2019s departure was to carry on His\nwork on the earth.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 18.\nGod\u2019s church is the court of holy life, \ufb01lled with varied gifts, and\nendowed with the Holy Spirit. The members are to \ufb01nd their happiness in the\nhappiness of those whom they help and bless. Wonderful is the work which\nthe Lord designs to accomplish through His church, that His name may be\nglori\ufb01ed.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 12, 13.\nOur work is plainly laid down in the Word of God. Christian is to be\nunited to Christian, church to church, the human instrumentality co-operating\nwith the divine, every agency to be subordinated to the Holy Spirit, and all to\nbe combined in giving to the world the good tidings of the grace of God.\u2014The\nGeneral Conference Bulletin, February 28, 1893, p. 421.\nOur churches are to co-operate in the work of spiritual tilling, with the\nhope of reaping by and by.... The soil is stubborn, but the fallow ground must\nbe broken up, the seeds of righteousness must be sown. Pause not, teachers\nbeloved by God, as though doubtful whether to prosecute\n14\na labor which will grow as performed.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:420.\nThe church is God\u2019s appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was\norganized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. From\nthe beginning it has been God\u2019s plan that through His church shall be re\ufb02ected\nto the world His fulness and His suf\ufb01ciency. The members of the church, those\nwhom He has called out of darkness into His marvelous light, are to show forth\nHis glory.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 9.\nLet no church think it is too small to exert an in\ufb02uence and do service in\nthe great work for this time.\nGo to work, brethren. It is not alone the large camp-meetings or\nconventions and councils that will have the especial favor of God; the humblest\neffort of unsel\ufb01sh love will be crowned with His blessings, and receive its great\nreward. Do what you can, and God will increase your ability.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, March 13, 1888.\nWitnesses\nWe are Christ\u2019s witnesses, and we are not to allow worldly interests and\nplans to absorb our time and attention.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:53, 54.\n\u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the Lord.... I have declared, and have saved,\nand I have showed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore ye\nare My witnesses.\u201d \u201cI the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\nthine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for\na light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from\nthe prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\u201d\u2014 The Acts\nof the Apostles, 10.\nThe people of the world are worshiping false gods. They are to be turned\nfrom their false worship, not by hearing denunciation of their idols, but by\nbeholding something better. God\u2019s goodness is to be made known. \u201cYe are\nMy witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am God.\u201d\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 299.\nAll who would enter the city of God must during their earthly life set forth\nChrist in their dealings. It is this\n15\nthat constitutes them the messengers of Christ, His witnesses. They are to\nbear a plain, decided testimony against all evil practices, pointing sinners to\nthe Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:23.\nThe disciples were to go forth as Christ\u2019s witnesses, to declare to the\nworld what they had seen and heard of Him. Their of\ufb01ce was the most\nimportant to which human beings had ever been called, second only to that\nof Christ Himself. They were to be workers together with God for the saving\nof men.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 19.\nThe divine Teacher says: My Spirit alone is competent to teach and\nto convict of sin. Externals make only a temporary impression upon the\nmind. I will enforce truth on the conscience, and men shall be My witnesses,\nthroughout the world asserting My claims on man\u2019s time, his money, his\nintellect.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:159.\nOur confession of His faithfulness is Heaven\u2019s chosen agency for revealing\nChrist to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace as made known through\nthe holy men of old; but that which will be most effectual is the testimony\nof our own experience. We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves\nthe working of a power that is divine. Every individual has a life distinct\nfrom all others, and an experience differing essentially from theirs. God\ndesires that our praise shall ascend to Him, marked by our own individuality.\nThese precious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace, when\nsupported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible power, that works for the\nsalvation of souls.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 347.\nGod cannot display the knowledge of His will and the wonders of His\ngrace among the unbelieving world, unless He has witnesses scattered all over\nthe earth. It is His plan that those who are partakers of this great salvation\nthrough Jesus Christ, should be His missionaries, bodies of light throughout\nthe world, to be as signs to the people, living epistles, known and read of\nall men, their faith and works testifying to the near approach of the coming\nSaviour, and showing that they have not received the grace of God in vain. The\npeople must be warned to prepare for the coming judgment.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 2:631, 632.\n16\nAs they [the disciples] meditated upon His pure, holy life, they felt that no\ntoil would be too hard, no sacri\ufb01ce too great, if only they could bear witness\nin their lives to the loveliness of Christ\u2019s character. O, if they could but have\nthe past three years to live over, they thought, how differently they would\nact! If they could only see the Master again, how earnestly they would strive\nto show Him how deeply they loved Him, and how sincerely they sorrowed\nfor having ever grieved Him by a word or an act of unbelief! But they were\ncomforted by the thought that they were forgiven. And they determined that,\nso far as possible, they would atone for their unbelief by bravely confessing\nHim before the world.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 36.\nThe two restored demoniacs were the \ufb01rst missionaries whom Christ sent\nto preach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a few moments only, these\nmen had been privileged to hear the teachings of Christ. Not one sermon from\nHis lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could not instruct the people as\nthe disciples who had been daily with Christ were able to do. But they bore\nin their own persons the evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell\nwhat they knew; what they themselves had seen, and heard, and felt of the\npower of Christ. This is what every one can do whose heart has been touched\nby the grace of God. John, the beloved disciple, wrote: \u201cThat which was from\nthe beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which\nwe have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that\nwhich we have seen and heard declare we unto you.\u201d As witnesses for Christ,\nwe are to tell what we know, what we ourselves have seen and heard and felt.\nIf we have been following Jesus step by step, we shall have something right to\nthe point to tell concerning the way in which He has led us. We can tell how\nwe have tested His promise, and found the promise true. We can bear witness\nto what we have known of the grace of Christ. This is the witness for which\nour Lord calls, and for want of which the world is perishing.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 340.\n17\nChannels of Light and Blessing\nWe are to be consecrated channels, through which the heavenly life is to\n\ufb02ow to others. The Holy Spirit is to animate and pervade the whole church,\npurifying and cementing hearts.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:20.\nEvery follower of Jesus has a work to do as a missionary for Christ, in\nthe family, in the neighborhood, in the town or city where he lives. All who\nare consecrated to God are channels of light. God makes them instruments\nof righteousness to communicate to others the light of truth.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 2:632.\nThe result of the work of Jesus, as He sat, weary and hungry, at the well,\nwas widespread in blessing. The one soul whom He sought to help became a\nmeans of reaching others and bringing them to the Saviour. This is ever the\nway that the work of God has made progress on the earth. Let your light shine,\nand other lights will be kindled.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 195.\nMany have an idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for their light\nand experience, independent of His recognized followers on earth. Jesus is the\nfriend of sinners; and His heart is touched with their woe. He has all power,\nboth in heaven and on earth; but He respects the means that He has ordained\nfor the enlightenment and salvation of men; He directs sinners to the church,\nwhich He has made a channel of light to the world.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles,\n122.\nTo the early church had been intrusted a constantly enlarging work,\u2014that\nof establishing centers of light and blessing wherever there were honest souls\nwilling to give themselves to the service of Christ.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles,\n90.\nAs the rays of the sun penetrate to the remotest corners of the globe, so\nGod designs that the light of the gospel shall extend to every soul upon the\nearth. If the church of Christ were ful\ufb01lling the purpose of our Lord, light\nwould be shed upon all that sit in darkness and in the region and shadow of\ndeath.\u2014 Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 42.\n18\nIt is the privilege of every soul to be a living channel through which God\ncan communicate to the world the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable\nriches of Christ. There is nothing that Christ desires so much as agents who\nwill represent to the world His Spirit and character. There is nothing that the\nworld needs so much as the manifestation through humanity of the Saviour\u2019s\nlove. All heaven is waiting for channels through which can be poured the holy\noil to be a joy and blessing to human hearts.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 419.\nThe glory of the church of God is in the piety of its members; for there\nis the hiding of Christ\u2019s power. The in\ufb02uence of the sincere children of God\nmay be esteemed as of little worth, but it will be felt throughout time, and\nrightly revealed in the day of reward. The light of a true Christian, shining\nforth in steadfast piety, in unwavering faith, will prove to the world the power\nof a living Saviour. In His followers Christ will be revealed as a well of water,\nspringing up into everlasting life. Although scarcely known to the world, they\nare acknowledged as God\u2019s peculiar people, His chosen vessels of salvation,\nHis channels whereby light is to come to the world.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nMarch 24, 1891.\nChurch members, let the light shine forth. Let your voices be heard in\nhumble prayer, in witness against intemperance, the folly and the amusements\nof this world, and in the proclamation of the truth for this time. Your voice,\nyour in\ufb02uence, your time,\u2014all these are gifts from God, and are to be used in\nwinning souls to Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:38.\nI have been shown that the disciples of Christ are His representatives upon\nthe earth; and God designs that they shall be lights in the moral darkness of\nthis world, dotted all over the country, in the towns, villages, and cities, \u201ca\nspectacle unto the world, to angels, and to man.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n2:631.\nThe followers of Christ are to be the light of the world; but God does not\nbid them make an effort to shine. He does not approve of any self-satis\ufb01ed\nendeavor to display superior goodness. He desires that their souls shall be\nimbued with the principles of heaven; then, as they come\n19\nin contact with the world, they will reveal the light that is in them. Their\nsteadfast \ufb01delity in every act of life will be a means of illumination.\u2014 The\nMinistry of Healing, 36.\nWhen, in the midst of his blind error and prejudice, Saul was given a\nrevelation of the Christ whom he was persecuting, he was placed in direct\ncommunication with the church, which is the light of the world. In this\ncase, Ananias represents Christ, and also represents Christ\u2019s ministers upon\nthe earth, who are appointed to act in His stead. In Christ\u2019s stead, Ananias\ntouches the eyes of Saul, that they may receive sight. In Christ\u2019s stead, he\nplaces his hands upon him, and as he prays in Christ\u2019s name, Saul receives the\nHoly Ghost. All is done in the name and by the authority of Christ. Christ is\nthe foundation; the church is the channel of communication.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 122.\nError is prevailing everywhere. The great adversary of souls is mustering\nhis forces. He is setting every device in operation in order to confuse the minds\nof men with specious errors, and thus destroy souls. Those with whom God\nhas intrusted the treasures of His truth are to let the light shine amid the moral\ndarkness.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 290.\nGod requires His people to shine as lights in the world. It is not merely\nthe ministers who are required to do this, but every disciple of Christ. Their\nconversation should be heavenly. And while they enjoy communion with God,\nthey will wish to have intercourse with their fellow men, in order to express\nby their words and acts the love of God which animates their hearts. In this\nway they will be lights in the world, and the light transmitted through them\nwill not go out or be taken away.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:122, 123.\nChrist\u2019s followers should be instruments of righteousness, workmen,\nliving stones, emitting light, that they may encourage the presence of heavenly\nangels. They are required to be channels, as it were, through which the spirit\nof truth and righteousness shall \ufb02ow.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:126, 127.\n20\nThe Lord has made His church the repository of divine in\ufb02uence. The\nheavenly universe is waiting for the members to become channels through\nwhich the current of life shall \ufb02ow to the world, that many may be converted,\nand in their turn become channels through which the grace of Christ shall \ufb02ow\nto the desert portions of the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\u2014 The Bible Echo , August 12,\n1901.\nEvery one who is connected with God will impart light to others. If there\nare any who have no light to give, it is because they have no connection with\nthe Source of light.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 291.\nGod has appointed His children to give light to others, and if they fail to\ndo it, and souls are left in the darkness of error because of their failure to do\nthat which they might have done, had they been vitalized by the Holy Spirit,\nthey will be accountable to God. We have been called out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light, in order that we may show forth the praises of Christ.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, December 12, 1893.\nAll who are consecrated to God will be channels of light. God makes them\nHis agents to communicate to others the riches of His grace.... Our in\ufb02uence\nupon others depends not so much upon what we say, as upon what we are.\nMen may combat and defy our logic, they may resist our appeals; but a life\nof disinterested love is an argument they cannot gainsay. A consistent life,\ncharacterized by the meekness of Christ, is a power in the world.\u2014 The Desire\nof Ages, 141, 142.\nThose who should have been the light of the world have shed forth but\nfeeble and sickly beams. What is light? It is piety, goodness, truth, mercy,\nlove; it is the revealing of the truth in the character and life. The gospel is\ndependent on the personal piety of its believers for its aggressive power, and\nGod has made provision through the death of His beloved Son, that every\nsoul may be thoroughly furnished unto every good work. Every soul is to be\na bright and shining light, showing forth the praises of Him who has called\nus out of darkness into His marvelous light. \u201cWe are laborers together with\nGod.\u201d Yes, laborers; that means doing earnest service in the vineyard of the\nLord. There\n21\nare souls to be saved,\u2014souls in our churches, in our Sabbath schools, and in\nour neighborhoods.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 24, 1891.\nIt is in working for others that they will keep their own souls alive. If\nthey will become colaborers with Jesus, we shall see the light in our churches\nsteadily burning brighter and brighter, sending forth its rays to penetrate the\ndarkness beyond their own borders.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 291.\n\u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d The Jews thought to con\ufb01ne the bene\ufb01ts of\nsalvation to their own nation; but Christ showed them that salvation is like the\nsunshine. It belongs to the whole world.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 306.\nHearts that respond to the in\ufb02uence of the Holy Spirit are the channels\nthrough which God\u2019s blessing \ufb02ows. Were those who served God removed\nfrom the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn from among men, this world would\nbe left to desolation and destruction, the fruit of Satan\u2019s dominion. Though the\nwicked know it not, they owe even the blessings of this life to the presence, in\nthe world, of God\u2019s people whom they despise and oppress. But if Christians\nare such in name only, they are like the salt that has lost its savor. They have\nno in\ufb02uence for good in the world. Through their misrepresentation of God\nthey are worse than unbelievers.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 306.\nThe Divine Commission\nThe work which the disciples did, we also are to do. Every Christian\nis to be a missionary. In sympathy and compassion we are to minister to\nthose in need of help, seeking with unsel\ufb01sh earnestness to lighten the woes\nof suffering humanity.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 104.\nBefore ascending to heaven, Christ gave His disciples their commission.\nHe told them that they were to be the executors of the will in which He\nbequeathed to the world the treasures of eternal life.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles,\n27.\nIn the trust given to the \ufb01rst disciples, believers in every age have shared.\nEvery one who has received the gospel has been given sacred truth to impart\nto the world. God\u2019s\n22\nfaithful people have always been aggressive missionaries, consecrating their\nresources to the honor of His name, and wisely using their talents in His\nservice.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 109.\nThe gospel commission is the great missionary charter of Christ\u2019s\nkingdom. The disciples were to work earnestly for souls, giving to all the\ninvitation of mercy. They were not to wait for the people to come to them;\nthey were to go to the people with their message.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles ,\n28.\nGod\u2019s messengers are commissioned to take up the very work that Christ\ndid while on this earth. They are to give themselves to every line of ministry\nthat He carried on. With earnestness and sincerity, they are to tell men of the\nunsearchable riches and the immortal treasure of heaven.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:130.\nThe commission given to the disciples is given also to us. Today, as then,\na cruci\ufb01ed and risen Saviour is to be uplifted before those who are without\nGod and without hope in the world. The Lord calls for pastors, teachers, and\nevangelists. From door to door His servants are to proclaim the message of\nsalvation. To every nation, kindred, tongue, and people the tidings of pardon\nthrough Christ are to be carried. Not with tame, lifeless utterances is the\nmessage to be given, but with clear, decided, stirring utterances. Hundreds\nare waiting for the warning to escape for their lives. The world needs to see\nin Christians an evidence of the power of Christianity. Not merely in a few\nplaces, but throughout the world, messages of mercy are needed.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 29.\nWhen Jesus ascended to heaven, He committed His work on earth to those\nwho had received the light of the gospel. They were to carry the work forward\nto completion. He has provided no other agency for the promulgation of His\ntruth. \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d\n\u201cAnd, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d This\nsolemn commission reaches us in this age. God leaves with His church the\nresponsibility of receiving or rejecting it.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 288.\n23\nUpon us is laid a sacred charge. The commission has been given us: \u201cGo\nye therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of\nthe Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all\nthings whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even\nunto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:19, 20, margin. You are dedicated to\nthe work of making known the gospel of salvation. Heaven\u2019s perfection is to\nbe your power.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:20, 21.\nCalled From Common Walks of Life\nThe common people are to take their place as workers. Sharing the sorrows\nof their fellow men as the Saviour shared the sorrows of humanity, they will\nby faith see Him working with them.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 38.\nIn all \ufb01elds, nigh and afar off, men will be called from the plow and\nfrom the more common commercial business vocations that largely occupy\nthe mind, and will be educated in connection with men of experience. As they\nlearn to labor effectively, they will proclaim the truth with power. Through\nmost wonderful workings of divine providence, mountains of dif\ufb01culty will\nbe removed, and cast into the sea. The message that means so much to the\ndwellers upon the earth, will be heard and understood. Men will know what\nis truth. Onward and still onward the work will advance, until the whole earth\nshall have been warned; and then shall the end come.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:96.\nGod can and will use those who have not had a thorough education in the\nschools of men. A doubt of His power to do this, is manifest unbelief; it is\nlimiting the omnipotent power of the One with whom nothing is impossible.\nO for less of this uncalled-for, distrustful caution! It leaves so many forces\nof the church unused; it closes up the way, so that the Holy Spirit cannot\nuse men; it keeps in idleness those who are willing and anxious to labor in\nChrist\u2019s lines; it discourages from entering the work many who would become\nef\ufb01cient laborers together with God, if they were given a fair chance.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 488, 489.\n24\nIt is the privilege of every soul to make advancement. Those who are\nconnected with Christ will grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Son of\nGod, to the full stature of men and women. If all who claim to believe the truth\nhad made the most of their ability and opportunities to learn and to do, they\nwould have become strong in Christ. Whatever their occupation,\u2014whether\nthey were farmers, mechanics, teachers, or pastors,\u2014if they had wholly\nconsecrated themselves to God, they would have become ef\ufb01cient workers\nfor the heavenly Master.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:423.\nThose in the church who have suf\ufb01cient talent to engage in any of\nthe various vocations of life, such as teaching, building, manufacturing,\nand farming, generally should be prepared to labor for the upbuilding of\nthe church by serving on committees or as teachers in Sabbath schools,\nengaging in missionary labor, or \ufb01lling the different of\ufb01ces connected with\nthe church.\u2014 The Review and Herald, February 15, 1887.\nFor the carrying on of His work, Christ did not choose the learning or\neloquence of the Jewish Sanhedrin or the power of Rome. Passing by the\nself-righteous Jewish teachers, the Master Worker chose humble, unlearned\nmen to proclaim the truths that were to move the world. These men He\npurposed to train and educate as the leaders of His church. They in turn were\nto educate others, and send them out with the gospel message. That they might\nhave success in their work, they were to be given the power of the Holy Spirit.\nNot by human might or human wisdom was the gospel to be proclaimed, but\nby the power of God.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 17.\nAmong those to whom the Saviour had given the commission, \u201cGo ye\ntherefore, and teach all nations,\u201d were many from the humbler walks of\nlife,\u2014men and women who had learned to love their Lord, and who had\ndetermined to follow His example of unsel\ufb01sh service. To these lowly ones,\nas well as to the disciples who had been with the Saviour during His earthly\nministry, had been given a precious trust. They were to carry to the world the\nglad tidings of salvation through Christ.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 105, 106.\n25\nThe Life That Wins\nIt is not only by preaching the truth, not only by distributing literature, that\nwe are to witness for God. Let us remember that a Christlike life is the most\npowerful argument that can be advanced in favor of Christianity, and that a\ncheap Christian character works more harm in the world than the character of\na worldling.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:21.\nNot all the books written can serve the purpose of a holy life. Men\nwill believe, not what the minister preaches, but what the church lives. Too\noften the in\ufb02uence of the sermon preached from the pulpit is counteracted\nby the sermon preached in the lives of those who claim to be advocates of\ntruth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:21.\nThe life of Christ was an ever-widening, shoreless in\ufb02uence, an in\ufb02uence\nthat bound Him to God and to the whole human family. Through Christ, God\nhas invested man with an in\ufb02uence that makes it impossible for him to live\nto himself. Individually we are connected with our fellow men, a part of\nGod\u2019s great whole, and we stand under mutual obligations. No man can be\nindependent of his fellow men; for the well-being of each affects others. It is\nGod\u2019s purpose that each shall feel himself necessary to others\u2019 welfare, and\nseek to promote their happiness.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 339.\nThe religion of the Bible is not to be con\ufb01ned between the covers of a\nbook, nor within the walls of a church. It is not to be brought out occasionally\nfor our own bene\ufb01t, and then to be carefully laid aside again. It is to sanctify\nthe daily life, to manifest itself in every business transaction and in all our\nsocial relations.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 306, 307.\nIt is the purpose of God to glorify Himself in His people before the world.\nHe expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him in thought,\nword, and deed. Their thoughts are to be pure and their words noble and\nuplifting, drawing those around them nearer the Saviour. The religion of\nChrist is to be interwoven with all that they do and say. Their every business\ntransaction is to be fragrant with the presence of God.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:21.\n26\nLet the business man do his business in a way that will glorify his Master\nbecause of his \ufb01delity. Let him carry his religion into everything that is done,\nand reveal to men the Spirit of Christ. Let the mechanic be a diligent and\nfaithful representative of Him who toiled in the lowly walks of life in the cities\nof Judea. Let every one who names the name of Christ so work that man by\nseeing his good works may be led to glorify his Creator and Redeemer.\u2014 The\nBible Echo, June 10, 1901.\nWomen as Missionaries\nWomen as well as men can engage in the work of hiding the truth where\nit can work out and be made manifest. They can take their place in the work\nat this crisis, and the Lord will work through them. If they are imbued with a\nsense of their duty, and labor under the in\ufb02uence of the Spirit of God, they will\nhave just the self-possession required for this time. The Saviour will re\ufb02ect\nupon these self-sacri\ufb01cing women the light of His countenance, and this will\ngive them a power that will exceed that of men. They can do in families a work\nthat men cannot do, a work that reaches the inner life. They can come close to\nthe hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Their work is needed. Discreet\nand humble women can do a good work in explaining the truth to the people\nin their homes. The Word of God thus explained will do its leavening work,\nand through its in\ufb02uence whole families will be converted.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:128, 129.\nAll who work for God should have the Martha and the Mary attributes\nblended,\u2014a willingness to minister, and a sincere love of the truth. Self and\nsel\ufb01shness must be put out of sight. God calls for earnest women workers,\nworkers who are prudent, warm-hearted, tender, and true to principle. He calls\nfor persevering women, who will take their minds from self and their personal\nconvenience, and will center them on Christ, speaking words of truth, praying\nwith the persons to whom they can obtain access, laboring for the conversion\nof souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:118.\n27\nThe sisters can work ef\ufb01ciently in obtaining subscribers for our\nperiodicals, in this way bringing the light before many minds.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, June 10, 1880.\nThere are noble women who have had moral courage to decide in favor of\nthe truth from the weight of evidence. They have conscientiously accepted the\ntruth. They have tact, perception, and good ability, and will make successful\nworkers for their Master. Christian women are called for.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, December 19, 1878.\nOur sisters can serve as vigilant workers in writing, and drawing out the\ntrue feelings of friends who have received our papers and tracts.... Women of\n\ufb01rm principle and decided character are needed, women who believe that we\nare indeed living in the last days, and that we have the last solemn message\nof warning to be given to the world.... These are the ones whom God can use\nin the tract and missionary work.... These can in many ways do a precious\nwork for God in scattering tracts and judiciously distributing the Signs of the\nTimes.\u2014 The Review and Herald, December 19, 1878.\nI do not recommend that woman should seek to become a voter or an of\ufb01ce\nholder; but as a missionary, teaching the truth by epistolary correspondence,\ndistributing tracts and soliciting subscribers for periodicals containing the\nsolemn truth for this time, she may do very much.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nDecember 19, 1878.\nIf there were twenty women where now there is one, who would make this\nholy mission their cherished work, we should see many more converted to the\ntruth.\u2014 The Review and Herald, January 2, 1879.\nWomen who can work are needed now, women who are not self-important,\nbut meek and lowly of heart, who will work with the meekness of Christ\nwherever they can \ufb01nd work to do for the salvation of souls.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, January 2, 1879.\nHundreds of our sisters might be at work today if they would. They\nshould dress themselves and their children with simplicity, in neat and durable\ngarments, free from\n28\nadornment, and devote the time they have spent in needless display to\nmissionary work. Letters may be written to friends at a distance. Our sisters\nmay meet together to consult as to the best manner of labor. Money can be\nsaved to present as an offering to God, to be invested in papers and tracts to\nsend to their friends. Those who are now doing nothing should go to work.\nLet each sister who claims to be a child of God feel indeed a responsibility to\nhelp all within her reach.\u2014 The Review and Herald, December 12, 1878.\nOur sisters have been too willing to excuse themselves from bearing\nresponsibilities which require thought and close application of the mind; yet\nthis is the very discipline they need to perfect Christian experience. They may\nbe workers in the missionary \ufb01eld, having a personal interest in the distribution\nof tracts and papers which correctly represent our faith.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, December 12, 1878.\nSisters, do not become weary of vigilant missionary labor. This is a work\nthat you may all engage in successfully, if you will but connect with God.\nBefore writing letters of inquiry, always lift up your heart to God in prayer,\nthat you may be successful in gathering some wild branches which may be\ngrafted into the true vine, and bear fruit to the glory of God. All who with\nhumble hearts take part in this work, will be continually educating themselves\nas workers in the vineyard of the Lord.\u2014 The Review and Herald , June 10,\n1880.\n29\nChap. 2 - The Call to Young People\nDivine Appointment\nThe Lord has appointed the youth to be His helping hand.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 7:64.\nWith such an army of workers as our youth, rightly trained, might furnish,\nhow soon the message of a cruci\ufb01ed, risen, and soon-coming Saviour might\nbe carried to the whole world!\u2014 Education, 271.\nWe have an army of youth today who can do much if they are properly\ndirected and encouraged. We want our children to believe the truth. We want\nthem to be blessed of God. We want them to act a part in well-organized plans\nfor helping other youth. Let all be so trained that they may rightly represent\nthe truth, giving the reason of the hope that is within them, and honoring\nGod in any branch of the work where they are quali\ufb01ed to labor.\u2014 General\nConference Daily Bulletin, January 29 1893.\nYouth in Church Work\nYouthful talent, well organized and well trained, is needed in our churches.\nThe youth will do something with their over\ufb02owing energies. Unless these\nenergies are directed into right channels, they will be used by the youth in\na way that will hurt their own spirituality, and prove an injury to those with\nwhom they associate.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 211.\nWhen the youth give their hearts to God, our responsibility for them does\nnot cease. They must be interested in the Lord\u2019s work, and led to see that He\nexpects them to do something to advance His cause. It is not enough to show\nhow much needs to be done, and to urge the youth to act a part. They must be\ntaught how to labor for the Master. They must be trained, disciplined, drilled,\nin the best methods of winning souls to Christ. Teach them to try in a quiet,\nunpretending way to help their young companions. Let different branches of\nmissionary effort be\n30\nsystematically laid out, in which they may take part, and let them be given\ninstruction and help. Thus they will learn to work for God.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n210.\nIn Earliest Years\nLet the kindness and courtesy of the minister be seen in his treatment of\nchildren. He should ever bear in mind that they are miniature men and women,\nyounger members of the Lord\u2019s family. These may be very near and dear to\nthe Master, and, if properly instructed and disciplined, will do service for Him,\neven in their youth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:397, 398.\nLet not the youth be ignored; let them share in the labor and responsibility.\nLet them feel that they have a part to act in helping and blessing others. Even\nthe children should be taught to do little errands of love and mercy for those\nless fortunate than themselves.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:435.\nParents should teach their children the value and right use of time. Teach\nthem that to do something which will honor God and bless humanity is\nworth striving for. Even in their early years they can be missionaries for\nGod.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 345.\nFuture Before Youth\nMany a lad of today, growing up as did Daniel in his Judean home,\nstudying God\u2019s word and His works, and learning the lessons of faithful\nservice, will yet stand in legislative assemblies, in halls of justice, or in royal\ncourts, as a witness for the King of kings.\u2014 Education, 262.\nTimothy a Mere Youth When Chosen\nPaul saw that Timothy was faithful, steadfast, and true, and he chose\nhim as a companion in labor and travel. Those who had taught Timothy in\nhis childhood were rewarded by seeing the son of their care linked in close\nfellowship with the great apostle. Timothy was a mere youth when he was\nchosen by God to be a teacher; but his principles had been so established by\nhis early education\n31\nthat he was \ufb01tted to take his place as Paul\u2019s helper. And though young, he bore\nhis responsibilities with Christian meekness.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles , 203,\n204.\nReserves to Fill Up the Ranks\nThe burden-bearers among us are falling in death. Many of those who\nhave been foremost in carrying out the reforms instituted by us as a people,\nare now past the meridian of life, and are declining in physical and mental\nstrength. With the deepest concern the question may be asked, Who will \ufb01ll\ntheir places? To whom are to be committed the vital interests of the church\nwhen the present standard-bearers fall? We cannot but look anxiously upon\nthe youth of today as those who must take these burdens, and upon whom\nresponsibilities must fall. These must take up the work where others leave it,\nand their course will determine whether morality, religion, and vital godliness\nshall prevail, or whether immorality and in\ufb01delity shall corrupt and blight all\nthat is valuable.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 68.\nPioneers in Toil and Sacri\ufb01ce\nWe must manifest con\ufb01dence in our young men. They should be pioneers\nin every enterprise involving toil and sacri\ufb01ce, while the overtaxed servants\nof Christ should be cherished as counselors, to encourage and bless those\nwho strike the heaviest blows for God.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and\nStudents, 516, 517.\nYoung men are wanted. God calls them to missionary \ufb01elds. Being\ncomparatively free from care and responsibilities, they are more favorably\nsituated to engage in the work than are those who must provide for the training\nand support of a large family. Furthermore, young men can more readily\nadapt themselves to new climates and new society, and can better endure\ninconveniences and hardships. By tact and perseverance, they can reach the\npeople where they are.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 517.\nMany young men who have had the right kind of education at home are\nto be trained for service, and encouraged to lift the standard of truth in new\nplaces by well-planned\n32\nand faithful work. By associating with our ministers and experienced workers\nin city work, they will gain the best kind of training. Acting under divine\nguidance, and sustained by the prayers of their more experienced fellow\nworkers, they may do a good and blessed work. As they unite their labors\nwith those of the older workers, using their youthful energies to the very best\naccount, they will have the companionship of heavenly angels; and as workers\ntogether with God, it is their privilege to sing and pray and believe, and work\nwith courage and freedom. The con\ufb01dence and trust that the presence of\nheavenly agencies will bring to them and to their fellow workers, will lead to\nprayer and praise and the simplicity of true faith.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:119.\nLines of Work\nThere are many lines in which the youth can \ufb01nd opportunity for\nhelpful effort. Companies should be organized and thoroughly educated to\nwork as nurses, gospel visitors, and Bible readers, as canvassers, ministers,\nand medical missionary evangelists.\u2014 Counsels to Parents , Teachers, and\nStudents, 546.\nWe should educate the youth to help the youth; and as they seek to do\nthis work, they will gain an experience that will qualify them to become\nconsecrated workers in a larger sphere.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:115.\nYoung men and women should be educated to become workers in their\nown neighborhoods and in other places. Let all set their hearts and minds to\nbecome intelligent in regard to the work for this time, qualifying themselves\nto do that for which they are best adapted.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:118,\n119.\nSecret of Success\nFollow on, young men, to know the Lord, and you will know that \u201cHis\ngoing forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d Seek constantly to improve. Strive\nearnestly for identity with the Redeemer. Live by faith in Christ. Do the work\nHe did. Live for the saving of the souls for whom He\n33\nlaid down His life. Try in every way to help those with whom you come in\ncontact.... Talk with your Elder Brother, who will complete your education,\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little. A close\nconnection with Him who offered Himself as a sacri\ufb01ce to save a perishing\nworld, will make you acceptable workers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:416.\nOrganize for Service\nYoung men and young women, cannot you form companies, and, as\nsoldiers of Christ, enlist in the work, putting all your tact and skill and talent\ninto the Master\u2019s service, that you may save souls from ruin? Let there be\ncompanies organized in every church to do this work.... Will the young men\nand young women who really love Jesus organize themselves as workers, not\nonly for those who profess to be Sabbath keepers, but for those who are not of\nour faith?\u2014 The Signs of the Times, May 29, 1893.\nLet young men and women and children go to work in the name of Jesus.\nLet them unite together upon some plan and order of action. Cannot you form\na band of workers, and have set times to pray together and ask the Lord to\ngive you His grace, and put forth united action?\u2014 Youth\u2019s Instructor August9,\n1894.\n34\nChap. 3 - Conditions Among God\u2019s\nPeople\nMissionary Spirit Lacking\nThere has been but little of the missionary spirit among Sabbath-keeping\nAdventists. If ministers and people were suf\ufb01ciently aroused, they would\nnot rest thus indifferently, while God has honored them by making them the\ndepositaries of His law, by printing it in their minds and writing it upon their\nhearts.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:202.\nThe true missionary spirit has deserted the churches that make so exalted\na profession; their hearts are no longer aglow with love for souls, and a desire\nto lead them into the fold of Christ. We want earnest workers. Are there none\nto respond to the cry that goes up from every quarter, \u201cCome over and help\nus\u201d?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:156.\nI was shown that as a people we are de\ufb01cient. Our works are not in\naccordance with our faith. Our faith testi\ufb01es that we are living under the\nproclamation of the most solemn and important message that was ever given\nto mortals. Yet in full view of this fact, our efforts, our zeal, our spirit of\nself-sacri\ufb01ce, do not compare with the character of the work. We should awake\nfrom the dead, and Christ will give us life.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:114.\nMy heart is pained when I think how little our churches sense their solemn\naccountabilities to God. It is not ministers alone who are soldiers, but every\nman and woman who has enlisted in Christ\u2019s army; and are they willing to\nreceive a soldier\u2019s fare, just as Christ has given them an example in His life\nof self-denial and sacri\ufb01ce? What self-denial have our churches as a whole\nmanifested? They may have given donations in money, but have withheld\nthemselves.\u2014 The General Conference Bulletin, 1893, 131.\nMany of the professed followers of Christ feel no more burden for souls\nthan do the world. The lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, the love of display,\nthe love of ease, separate the professed Christians from God, and the\n35\nmissionary spirit in reality exists in but few. What can be done to open the\neyes of these sinners in Zion, and make hypocrites tremble?\u2014 The General\nConference Bulletin, 1893, 132.\nThere is a class that are represented by Meroz. The missionary spirit\nhas never taken hold of their souls. The calls of foreign missions have not\nstirred them to action. What account will those render to God, who are doing\nnothing in His cause,\u2014nothing to win souls to Christ? Such will receive the\ndenunciation, \u201cThou wicked and slothful servant.\u201d\u2014 Historical Sketches, 290.\nAs an illustration of the failure on your part to come up to the work of\nGod, as was your privilege, I was referred to these words: \u201cCurse ye Meroz,\nsaid the angel of the Lord, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because\nthey came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the\nmighty.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:247.\nA Self-complacent Class\nThere was presented before me a class who are conscious that they possess\ngenerous impulses, devotional feelings, and a love of doing good; yet at the\nsame time they are doing nothing. They possess a self-complacent feeling,\n\ufb02attering themselves that if they had an opportunity, or were circumstanced\nmore favorably, they could and would do a great and good work; but they are\nwaiting the opportunity. They despise the narrow mind of the poor niggard\nwho grudges the small pittance to the needy. They see that he lives for self,\nthat he will not be called from himself to do good to others, to bless them\nwith the talents of in\ufb02uence and of means which have been committed to him\nto use, not to abuse, nor to permit to rust, or lie buried in the earth. Those\nwho give themselves up to their stinginess and sel\ufb01shness, are accountable for\ntheir niggardly acts, and are responsible for the talents they abuse. But more\nresponsible are those who have generous impulses, and are naturally quick\nto discern spiritual things, if they remain inactive, waiting an opportunity\nthey suppose has not come, yet contrasting their readiness to do with the\nwillingness of\n36\nthe niggard, and re\ufb02ecting that their condition is more favorable than that of\ntheir mean-souled neighbors. Such deceive themselves. The mere possession\nof qualities which are not used, only increases their responsibility; and if they\nkeep their Master\u2019s talents unimproved, or hoarded, their condition is no better\nthan that of their neighbors for whom their souls feel such contempt. To them\nit will be said, \u201cYe knew your Master\u2019s will, yet did it not.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 2:250, 251.\nSatanic Death Stupor\nGod\u2019s people must take warning and discern the signs of the times. The\nsigns of Christ\u2019s coming are too plain to be doubted; and in view of these\nthings every one who professes the truth should be a living preacher. God\ncalls upon all, both preachers and people, to awake. All heaven is astir. The\nscenes of earth\u2019s history are fast closing. We are amid the perils of the last\ndays. Greater perils are before us, and yet we are not awake. This lack of\nactivity and earnestness in the cause of God is dreadful. This death stupor is\nfrom Satan.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:260, 261.\nUnbelief, like the pall of death, is surrounding our churches, because they\ndo not exercise the talents God has given them, by imparting the light to those\nwho know not the precious truth. The Lord calls for the pardoned souls, those\nwho rejoice in the light, to make known the truth to others.\u2014 The General\nConference Bulletin, 1893, 133.\nSatan is now seeking to hold God\u2019s people in a state of inactivity, to\nkeep them from acting their part in spreading the truth, that they may at last\nbe weighed in the balance and found wanting.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:260.\nMen are in peril. Multitudes are perishing. But how few of the professed\nfollowers of Christ are burdened for these souls. The destiny of a world hangs\nin the balance; but this hardly moves even those who claim to believe the most\nfar-reaching truth ever given to mortals. There is a lack of that love which led\nChrist to leave His heavenly home and take man\u2019s nature, that humanity might\ntouch\n37\nhumanity, and draw humanity to divinity. There is a stupor, a paralysis, upon\nthe people of God, which prevents them from understanding the duty of the\nhour.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 303.\nSatan uses the listless, sleepy indolence of professed Christians to\nstrengthen his forces and win souls to his side. Many who think that though\nthey are doing no actual work for Christ, they are yet on His side, are enabling\nthe enemy to pre-occupy ground and gain advantages. By their failure to be\ndiligent workers for the Master, by leaving duties undone and words unspoken,\nthey have allowed Satan to gain control of souls who might have been won for\nChrist.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 280.\nWhen I study the Scriptures, I am alarmed for the Israel of God in these last\ndays. They are exhorted to \ufb02ee from idolatry. I fear that they are asleep, and so\nconformed to the world that it would be dif\ufb01cult to discern between him that\nserveth God and him that serveth Him not. The distance is widening between\nChrist and His people, and lessening between them and the world. The marks\nof distinction between Christ\u2019s professed people and the world have almost\ndisappeared. Like ancient Israel, they follow after the abominations of the\nnations around them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:277.\nSpiritual Discernment Dimmed\nAnd not only in the world do we see the result of the church\u2019s neglect to\nwork in Christ\u2019s lines. By this neglect a condition of things has been brought\ninto the church that has eclipsed the high and holy interests of the work of\nGod. A spirit of criticism and bitterness has come into the church, and the\nspiritual discernment of many has been dimmed. Because of this the cause of\nChrist has suffered great loss.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:297.\nI am \ufb01lled with sadness when I think of our condition as a people. The\nLord has not closed heaven to us, but our own course of continual backsliding\nhas separated us from God. Pride, covetousness, and love of the world\n38\nhave lived in the heart without fear of banishment or condemnation. Grievous\nand presumptuous sins have dwelt among us. And yet the general opinion is\nthat the church is \ufb02ourishing, and that peace and spiritual prosperity are in\nall her borders. The church has turned back from following Christ her leader,\nand is steadily retreating toward Egypt. Yet few are alarmed or astonished at\ntheir want of spiritual power. Doubt and even disbelief of the testimonies of\nthe Spirit of God is leavening our churches everywhere. Satan would have it\nthus.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:217.\nA State of Spiritual Weakness\nAccumulated light has shone upon God\u2019s people, but many have neglected\nto follow the light, and for this reason they are in a state of great spiritual\nweakness. It is not for lack of knowledge that God\u2019s people are now perishing.\nThey will not be condemned because they do not know the way, the truth, and\nthe life. The truth that has reached their understanding, the light which has\nshone on the soul, but which has been neglected or refused, will condemn\nthem. Those who never had the light to reject, will not be in condemnation.\nWhat more could have been done for God\u2019s vineyard than has been done?\nLight, precious light, shines upon God\u2019s people; but it will not save them,\nunless they consent to be saved by it, fully live up to it, and transmit it to\nothers in darkness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:123.\nThe Need of Heavenly Eyesalve\nThe churches need to have their eyes anointed with the heavenly eyesalve,\nthat they may see the many opportunities all about them to minister for God.\nRepeatedly God has called upon His people to go out into the highways and\nhedges, and compel men to come in, that His house may be full, yet even\nwithin the shadow of our own doors are families in which we have not shown\nsuf\ufb01cient interest to lead them to think that we cared for their souls. It is this\nwork lying nearest us that the Lord now calls upon the church to undertake.\nWe are not to stand, saying, \u201cWho is my neighbor?\u201d We are to remember that\nour neighbor is the one who need our sympathy and help. Our neighbor\n39\nis every soul who is wounded and bruised by the adversary. Our neighbor is\nevery one who is the property of God. In Christ the distinctions made by the\nJews as to who was their neighbor are swept away. There are no territorial\nlines, no arti\ufb01cial distinctions, no caste, no aristocracy.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:294.\nFanaticism and Cold Formalism\nSatan is now working with all his insinuating, deceiving power, to lead\nmen away from the work of the third angel\u2019s message, which is to be\nproclaimed with mighty power. When the enemy sees that the Lord is blessing\nHis people, and preparing them to discern his delusions, he will work with his\nmasterly power to bring in fanaticism on one hand and cold formalism on the\nother, that he may gather in a harvest of souls. Now is the time to watch\nunceasingly. Watch for the \ufb01rst step of advance that Satan may make among\nus.\u2014 The Review and Herald, January 24, 1893.\nThere are moral icebergs in our churches. There are plenty of formalists\nwho can make an imposing display, but cannot shine as lights in the\nworld.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 24, 1891.\nNarrowed by Sel\ufb01shness\nThe reason why God\u2019s people are not more spiritual minded, and have\nno more faith, I have been shown, is because they are narrowed up with\nsel\ufb01shness.... It is not the abundance of your meetings that God accepts. It\nis not the numerous prayers, but the right-doing, doing the right thing, and at\nthe right time.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:36.\nCovetousness\nYet some refused to be converted. They were not willing to walk in\nGod\u2019s way, and when, in order that the work of God might be advanced,\ncalls were made for freewill offerings, some clung sel\ufb01shly to their earthly\npossessions. These covetous ones became separated from the company of\nbelievers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:126.\n40\nNot One in Twenty Prepared\nIt is a solemn statement that I make to the church, that not one in twenty\nwhose names are registered upon the church books are prepared to close their\nearthly history, and would be as verily without God and without hope in the\nworld as the common sinner. They are professedly serving God, but they\nare more earnestly serving mammon. This half-and-half work is a constant\ndenying of Christ, rather than a confessing of Christ. So many have brought\ninto the church their own unsubdued spirit, unre\ufb01ned; their spiritual taste is\nperverted by their own immoral, debasing corruptions, symbolizing the world\nin spirit, in heart, in purpose, con\ufb01rming themselves in lustful practices, and\nare full of deception through and through in their professed Christian life.\nLiving as sinners, claiming to be Christians! Those who claim to be Christians\nand will confess Christ should come out from among them and touch not the\nunclean thing, and be separate....\nI lay down my pen and lift up my soul in prayer, that the Lord would\nbreathe upon His backslidden people, who are as dry bones, that they may live.\nThe end is near, stealing upon us so stealthily, so imperceptibly, so noiselessly,\nlike the muf\ufb02ed tread of the thief in the night, to surprise the sleepers off guard\nand unready. May the Lord grant to bring His Holy Spirit upon hearts that are\nnow at ease, that they may no longer sleep as do others, but watch and be\nsober.\u2014 The General Conference Bulletin, 1893, 132, 133.\nRevival and Reformation Needed\nChristians should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the world as\nan overwhelming surprise, and this preparation they should make by diligently\nstudying the word of God, and striving to conform their lives to its precepts....\nGod calls for a revival and a reformation.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 626.\nA revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all\nour needs. To seek this should be our \ufb01rst work.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nMarch 22, 1887.\n41\nThe time has come for a thorough reformation to take place. When this\nreformation begins, the spirit of prayer will actuate every believer, and will\nbanish from the church the spirit of discord and strife.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 8:251.\nA revival and a reformation must take place under the ministration of the\nHoly Spirit. Revival and reformation are two different things. Revival signi\ufb01es\na renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart, a\nresurrection from the spiritual death. Reformation signi\ufb01es a reorganization, a\nchange in ideas and theories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring\nforth the good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival\nof the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work, and\nin doing this work they must blend.\u2014 The Review and Herald , February 25,\n1902.\nDo not the Scriptures call for a more pure and holy work than we have\nyet seen? ... God calls upon those who are willing to be controlled by the\nHoly Spirit to lead out in a work of thorough reformation. I see a crisis before\nus, and the Lord calls for His laborers to come into line. Every soul should\nnow stand in a position of deeper, truer consecration to God than during the\nyears that have passed.... I have been deeply impressed by scenes that have\nrecently passed before me in the night season. There seemed to be a great\nmovement\u2014a work of revival\u2014going forward in many places. Our people\nwere moving into line, responding to God\u2019s call.\u2014 The General Conference\nBulletin, May 29, 1913, p. 34.\nIn visions of the night representations passed before me of a great\nreformatory movement among God\u2019s people. Many were praising God. The\nsick were healed, and other miracles were wrought.... Hundreds and thousands\nwere seen visiting families, and opening before them the word of God. Hearts\nwere convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine\nconversion was manifest. On every side doors were thrown open to the\nproclamation of the truth. The world seemed to be lightened with the heavenly\nin\ufb02uence. Great blessings were received by the true and humble people of\nGod.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:126.\n42\nThere is great necessity for a reformation among the people of God. The\npresent state of the church leads to the inquiry, Is this a correct representation\nof Him who gave His life for us?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:474.\nWhen the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall have been wiped\naway from the church, the Spirit of the Lord will be graciously manifested.\nDivine power will be revealed. The church will see the providential working\nof the Lord of hosts. The light of truth will shine forth in clear, strong rays,\nand as in the time of the apostles, many souls will turn from error to truth.\nThe earth will be lightened with the glory of the Lord.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:46.\nDelay Is Fatal\nI was shown God\u2019s people waiting for some change to take place,\u2014a\ncompelling power to take hold of them. But they will be disappointed, for\nthey are wrong. They must act; they must take hold of the work themselves,\nand earnestly cry to God for a true knowledge of themselves. The scenes\nwhich are passing before us are of suf\ufb01cient magnitude to cause us to arouse,\nand urge the truth home to the hearts of all who will listen. The harvest of the\nearth is nearly ripe.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:261.\nOn the other hand, there are some who, instead of wisely improving\npresent opportunities, are idly waiting for some special season of spiritual\nrefreshing by which their ability to enlighten others will be greatly increased.\nThey neglect present duties and privileges, and allow their light to burn dim,\nwhile they look forward to a time when, without any effort on their part,\nthey will be made the recipients of special blessing, by which they will be\ntransformed and \ufb01tted for service.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 54.\nNot Producers but Consumers\nThe professed followers of Christ are on trial before the heavenly universe;\nbut the coldness of their zeal and the feebleness of their efforts in God\u2019s\nservice, mark them as unfaithful. If what they are doing were the best they\n43\ncould do, condemnation would not rest upon them; but were their hearts\nenlisted in the work, they could do much more. They know, and the world\nknows, that they have to a great degree lost the spirit of self-denial and\ncross-bearing. Many there are against whose names will be found written\nin the books of heaven, Not producers, but consumers. By many who bear\nChrist\u2019s name, His glory is obscured, His beauty veiled, His honor withheld.\nThere are many whose names are on the church books, but who are not\nunder Christ\u2019s rule. They are not heeding His instruction or doing His work.\nTherefore they are under the control of the enemy. They are doing no positive\ngood, therefore they are doing incalculable harm. Because their in\ufb02uence is\nnot a savor of life unto life, it is a savor of death unto death.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 303, 304.\nCommandment Keeping a Cloak for Sin\nThe same danger exists today among the people who profess to be the\ndepositaries of God\u2019s law. They are too apt to \ufb02atter themselves that the regard\nin which they hold the commandments will preserve them from the power of\ndivine justice. They refuse to be reproved for evil, and charge God\u2019s servants\nwith being too zealous in putting sin out of the camp. A sin-hating God calls\nupon those who profess to keep His law to depart from all iniquity. Neglect\nto repent and obey His word will bring as serious consequences upon God\u2019s\npeople today as did the same sin upon ancient Israel. There is a limit beyond\nwhich He will no longer delay His judgments.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n4:166, 167.\nDead in Trespasses and Sins\nToday a large part of those who compose our congregations are dead in\ntrespasses and sins. They come and go like the door upon its hinges. For years\nthey have complacently listened to the most solemn, soul-stirring truths, but\nthey have not put them in practice. Therefore they are less and less sensible of\nthe preciousness of truth.... While making a profession, they deny the power\nof godliness. If they continue in this state, God will reject them. They are\n44\nun\ufb01tting themselves to be members of His family.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:426, 427.\nHuman Moralists\nMany who call themselves Christians are mere human moralists. They\nhave refused the gift which alone could enable them to honor Christ by\nrepresenting Him to the world. The work of the Holy Spirit is to them a\nstrange work. They are not doers of the word. The heavenly principles\nthat distinguish those who are one with Christ from those who are one with\nthe world have become almost indistinguishable. The professed followers of\nChrist are no longer a separate and peculiar people. The line of demarcation\nis indistinct. The people are subordinating themselves to the world, to its\npractices, its customs, its sel\ufb01shness. The church has gone over to the world\nin transgression of the law, when the world should have come over to the\nchurch in obedience to the law. Daily the church is being converted to the\nworld.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 315, 316.\nA Spotted Record\nMany have a form of godliness, their names are upon the church records,\nbut they have a spotted record in heaven. The recording angel has faithfully\nwritten their deeds. Every sel\ufb01sh act, every wrong word, every unful\ufb01lled\nduty, and every secret sin, with every artful dissembling, is faithfully\nchronicled in the book of records kept by the recording angel.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 2:442.\nThe Burden-Bearers Are Wearing Out\nBecause some will not lift the burdens they could lift, or do the work\nthey might do, the work is too great for the few who will engage in it.\nThey see so much to do that they overtax their strength, and are fast wearing\nout.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:645.\nUnable to Give an Intelligent Reason for Faith\nMany who profess to believe the truth for these last days, will be found\nwanting. They have neglected the weightier matters. Their conversion is\nsuper\ufb01cial, not deep, earnest, and thorough. They do not know why they\nbelieve\n45\nthe truth, only because others have believed it, and they take it for granted\nthat it is the truth. They can give no intelligent reason why they believe....\nOthers are not enlightened or edi\ufb01ed by their experience, or by the knowledge\nwhich it was their privilege and duty to obtain. Strength and stability are with\ntruehearted professors.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:634.\nSome Will Trace Down the Prophetic Roll\nGod has a people upon the earth who in faith and holy hope are tracing\ndown the roll of fast-ful\ufb01lling prophecy, and are seeking to purify their souls\nby obeying the truth, that they may not be found without the wedding garment\nwhen Christ shall appear.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:307.\nAn Impressive Dream\nIn a dream given me September 29, 1886, I was walking with a large\ncompany who were looking for berries. There were many young men and\nwomen in the company who were to help in gathering the fruit. We seemed to\nbe in a city, for there was very little vacant ground; but around the city there\nwere open \ufb01elds, beautiful groves, and cultivated gardens. A large wagon\nladen with provisions for our company went before us.\nSoon the wagon halted, and the party scattered in every direction to look\nfor fruit. All around the wagon were both high and low bushes, bearing large,\nbeautiful whortleberries; but the company were all looking too far away to see\nthem. I began to gather the fruit near by, but very carefully, for fear of picking\nthe green berries, which were so mingled with the ripe fruit that I could pick\nonly one or two berries from a cluster.\nSome of the nice large berries had fallen to the ground, and were half\nconsumed by worms and insects. \u201cOh,\u201d thought I, \u201cif this \ufb01eld had only been\nentered before, all this precious fruit might have been saved! But it is too late\nnow. I will, however, pick these from the ground, and see if there is any good\nin them. Even if the whole berry is spoiled, I can at least show the brethren\nwhat they might have found if they had not been too late.\u201d\n46\nJust then two or three of the party came sauntering around where I was.\nThey were chatting, and seemed to be much occupied with each other\u2019s\ncompany. Seeing me, they said, \u201cWe have looked everywhere, and can \ufb01nd\nno fruit.\u201d They looked with astonishment at the quantity I had. I said, \u201cThere\nare more to be gathered from these bushes.\u201d They began picking, but soon\nstopped, saying, \u201cIt is not fair for us to pick here; you found this spot, and\nthe fruit is yours.\u201d But I replied, \u201cThat makes no difference. Gather wherever\nyou can \ufb01nd anything. This is God\u2019s \ufb01eld, and these are His berries; it is your\nprivilege to pick them.\u201d\nBut soon I seemed to be alone again. Every little while I heard talking and\nlaughing at the wagon. I called out to those who were there, \u201cWhat are you\ndoing?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe could not \ufb01nd any berries, and as we were tired\nand hungry, we thought we would come to the wagon and take a lunch. After\nwe have rested awhile, we will go out again.\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d I said, \u201cyou have brought in nothing as yet. You are eating up all\nour supplies, without giving us any more. I cannot eat now; there is too much\nfruit to be picked. You did not \ufb01nd it because you did not look close enough.\nIt does not hang on the outside of the bushes, you must search for it. True, you\ncannot pick it by handfuls; but by looking carefully among the green berries,\nyou will \ufb01nd very choice fruit.\u201d\nMy small pail was soon full of berries, and I took them to the wagon. Said\nI, \u201cThis is the nicest fruit that I ever picked, and I gathered it near by, while\nyou have wearied yourselves by searching at a distance without success.\u201d\nThen all came to see my fruit. They said, \u201cThese are high-bush berries,\n\ufb01rm and good. We did not think we could \ufb01nd anything on the high bushes,\nso we hunted for low-bush berries only, and found but few of these.\u201d\nThen I said, \u201cWill you take care of these berries, and then go with me to\nlook for more fruit on the high bushes?\u201d But they had made no preparation to\ncare for the fruit. There were dishes and sacks in abundance but they had been\nused to hold food. I became tired of waiting, and \ufb01nally asked, \u201cDid you not\ncome to gather fruit? Then why are you not prepared to take care of it?\u201d\n47\nOne responded, \u201cSister White, we did not really expect to \ufb01nd any fruit\nwhere there were so many houses, and so much going on; but as you seemed\nso anxious to gather fruit, we decided to come with you. We thought we would\nbring enough to eat, and would enjoy the recreation, if we did not gather any\nfruit.\u201d\nI answered, \u201cI cannot understand this kind of work. I shall go to the bushes\nagain at once. The day is already far spent, soon the night will be here, in\nwhich we can gather no fruit.\u201d Some went with me, but others remained by\nthe wagon to eat.\nIn one place a little company had collected, and were busily talking about\nsomething in which they seemed much interested. I drew near, and found that\na little child in a woman\u2019s arms had attracted their attention. I said, \u201cYou have\nbut a little time, and might better work while you can.\u201d\nThe attention of many was attracted by a young man and a young woman\nwho were running a race to the wagon. On reaching it, they were so tired that\nthey had to sit down and rest. Others also had thrown themselves down on the\ngrass to rest.\nThus the day wore on, and very little was accomplished. At last I said:\n\u201cBrethren, you call this an unsuccessful expedition. If this is the way you\nwork, I do not wonder at your lack of success. Your success or failure depends\nupon the way you take hold of the work. There are berries here; for I have\nfound them. Some of you have been searching the low bushes in vain; others\nhave found a few berries; but the high bushes have been passed by, simply\nbecause you did not expect to \ufb01nd fruit on them. You see that the fruit which\nI have gathered is large and ripe. In a little while other berries will ripen, and\nwe can go over the bushes again. This is the way in which I was taught to\ngather fruit. If you had searched near the wagon. You might have found fruit\nas well as I.\n\u201cThe lesson that you have this day given to those who are just learning how\nto do this kind of work, will be copied by them. The Lord has placed these\nfruit-bearing bushes right in the midst of these thickly settled places, and He\nexpects you to \ufb01nd them. But you have been altogether too\n48\nmuch engaged in eating, and amusing yourselves. You did not come to the\n\ufb01eld with an earnest determination to \ufb01nd fruit.\n\u201cYou must hereafter work with more zeal and earnestness, and with an\naltogether different object in view, or your labors will never be successful.\nBy working in the right way, you will teach the younger workers that such\nmatters as eating and recreation are of minor importance. It has been hard\nwork to bring the wagon of supplies to the ground, but you have thought more\nof the supplies than of the fruit you ought to carry home as the result of your\nlabors. You should be diligent, \ufb01rst to pick the berries nearest you, and then\nto search for those farther away; after that you can return and work near by\nagain, and thus you will be successful.\u201d\u2014 Gospel Workers, 136-139.\nThe Test to Be Met\nIn the last solemn work few great men will be engaged. They are\nself-suf\ufb01cient, independent of God, and He cannot use them. The Lord has\nfaithful servants, who in the shaking, testing time will be disclosed to view.\nThere are precious ones now hidden who have not bowed the knee to Baal.\nThey have not had the light which has been shining in a concentrated blaze\nupon you. But, it may be under a rough and uninviting exterior the pure\nbrightness of a genuine Christian character will be revealed. In the daytime\nwe look toward heaven, but do not see stars. They are there, \ufb01xed in the\n\ufb01rmament, but the eye cannot distinguish them. In the night we behold their\ngenuine luster.\nThe time is not far distant, when the test will come to every soul.... In this\ntime, the gold will be separated from the dross in the church. True godliness\nwill be clearly distinguished from the appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star\nthat we have admired for its brilliancy, will then go out in darkness. Chaff like\na cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from places where we see only\n\ufb02oors of rich wheat. All who assume the ornaments of the sanctuary, but are\nnot clothed with Christ\u2019s righteousness, will appear in the shame of their own\nnakedness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:80, 81.\n49\nChap. 4 - World Conditions Facing the\nChristian Worker\nThe World Drama\nThe world is a theater; the actors, its inhabitants, are preparing to act\ntheir part in the last great drama. With the great masses of mankind, there\nis no unity, except as men confederate to accomplish their sel\ufb01sh purposes.\nGod is looking on. His purposes in regard to His rebellious subjects will\nbe ful\ufb01lled. The world has not been given into the hands of men, though\nGod is permitting the elements of confusion and disorder to bear sway for a\nseason. A power from beneath is working to bring about the last great scenes\nin the drama,\u2014Satan coming as Christ, and working with all deceivableness\nof unrighteousness in those who are binding themselves together in secret\nsocieties. Those who are yielding to the passion for confederation are\nworking out the plans of the enemy. The cause will be followed by the\neffect.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:27, 28.\nLast Act of the Drama\nNever did this message apply with greater force than it applies today. More\nand more the world is setting at naught the claims of God. Men have become\nbold in transgression. The wickedness of the inhabitants of the world has\nalmost \ufb01lled up the measure of their iniquity. This earth has almost reached\nthe place where God will permit the destroyer to work his will upon it. The\nsubstitution of the laws of men for the law of God, the exaltation, by merely\nhuman authority, of Sunday in place of the Bible Sabbath, is the last act in the\ndrama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will reveal Himself.\nHe will arise in His majesty to shake terribly the earth. He will come out of\nHis place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity, and the earth\nshall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 7:141.\n50\nThe Crisis of the Ages\nWe are standing on the threshold of the crisis of the ages. In quick\nsuccession the judgments of God will follow one another,\u2014\ufb01re, and \ufb02ood,\nand earthquake, with war and bloodshed. We are not to be surprised at this\ntime by events both great and decisive; for the angel of mercy cannot remain\nmuch longer to shelter the impenitent.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 278.\nThe crisis is stealing gradually upon us. The sun shines in the heavens,\npassing over its usual round, and the heavens still declare the glory of God.\nMen are still eating and drinking, planting and building, marrying and giving\nin marriage. Merchants are still buying and selling. Men are jostling one\nagainst another, contending for the highest place. Pleasure lovers are still\ncrowding to theaters, horse races, gambling hells. The highest excitement\nprevails, yet probation\u2019s hour is fast closing, and every case is about to be\neternally decided. Satan sees that his time is short. He has set all his agencies\nat work that men may be deceived, deluded, occupied, and entranced until the\nday of probation shall be ended, and the door of mercy forever shut.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, October 3, 1905.\nTransgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion \ufb01lls the world, and\na great terror is soon to come upon human beings. The end is very near. We\nwho know the truth should be preparing for what is soon to break upon the\nworld as an overwhelming surprise.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:28.\nIn this time of prevailing iniquity we may know that the last great crisis\nis at hand. When the de\ufb01ance of God\u2019s law is almost universal, when\nHis people are oppressed and af\ufb02icted by their fellow men, the Lord will\ninterpose.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 178.\nWe are standing upon the threshold of great and solemn events. Prophecies\nare ful\ufb01lling. Strange, eventful history is being recorded in the books of\nheaven. Everything in our world is in agitation. There are wars, and rumors\nof wars. The nations are angry, and the time of the dead has come, that they\nshould be judged. Events are changing\n51\nto bring about the day of God which hasteth greatly. Only a moment of time,\nas it were, yet remains. But while already nation is rising against nation,\nand kingdom against kingdom, there is not now a general engagement. As\nyet the four winds are held until the servants of God shall be sealed in their\nforeheads. Then the powers of earth will marshal their forces for the last great\nbattle.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:14.\nRestraining Spirit of God Being Withdrawn\nThe restraining Spirit of God is even now being withdrawn from the world.\nHurricanes, storms, tempests, \ufb01re and \ufb02ood, disasters by sea and land, follow\neach other in quick succession. Science seeks to explain all these. The signs\nthickening around us, telling of the near approach of the Son of God, are\nattributed to any other than the true cause. Men cannot discern the sentinel\nangels restraining the four winds that they shall not blow until the servants of\nGod are sealed; but when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there shall\nbe such a scene of strife as no pen can picture.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:408.\nThe days in which we live are solemn and important. The Spirit of God is\ngradually but surely being withdrawn from the earth. Plagues and judgments\nare already falling upon the despisers of the grace of God. The calamities by\nland and sea, the unsettled state of society, the alarms of war, are portentous.\nThey forecast approaching events of the greatest magnitude. The agencies of\nevil are combining their forces, and consolidating. They are strengthening for\nthe last great crisis. Great changes are soon to take place in our world, and the\n\ufb01nal movements will be rapid ones.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:11.\nThe time is at hand when there will be sorrow in the world that no human\nbalm can heal. The Spirit of God is being withdrawn. Disasters by sea and\nby land follow one another in quick succession. How frequently we hear of\nearthquakes and tornadoes, of destruction by \ufb01re and \ufb02ood, with great loss\nof life and property! Apparently these calamities are capricious outbreaks of\ndisorganized, unregulated forces of nature, wholly beyond the control\n52\nof man; but in them all, God\u2019s purpose may be read. They are among the\nagencies by which He seeks to arouse men and women to a sense of their\ndanger.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 277.\nThe World a Pesthouse\nMen in their blindness boast of wonderful progress and enlightenment;\nbut the heavenly watchers see the earth \ufb01lled with corruption and violence.\nBecause of sin the atmosphere of our world has become as the atmosphere of\na pesthouse.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:10, 11.\nAn Epidemic of Crime\nWe are living in the midst of an \u201cepidemic of crime,\u201d at which thoughtful,\nGod-fearing men everywhere stand aghast. The corruption that prevails,\nit is beyond the power of the human pen to describe. Every day brings\nfresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and fraud. Every day brings its\nheart-sickening record of violence and lawlessness, of indifference to human\nsuffering, of brutal, \ufb01endish destruction of human life. Every day testi\ufb01es to\nthe increase of insanity, murder, and suicide. Who can doubt that satanic\nagencies are at work among men with increasing activity to distract and\ncorrupt the mind, and de\ufb01le and destroy the body?\u2014 The Ministry of Healing,\n142, 143.\nThe spirit of anarchy is permeating all nations, and the outbreaks that from\ntime to time excite the horror of the world are but indications of the pent-up\n\ufb01res of passion and lawlessness that, having once escaped control, will \ufb01ll\nthe earth with woe and desolation. The picture which Inspiration has given\nof the antediluvian world, represents too truly the condition to which modern\nsociety is fast hastening. Even now, in the present century, and in professedly\nChristian lands, there are crimes daily perpetrated, as black and terrible as\nthose for which the old-world sinners were destroyed. Before the \ufb02ood, God\nsent Noah to warn the world, that the people might be led to repentance,\nand thus escape the threatened destruction. As the time of Christ\u2019s second\nappearing draws near, the Lord sends His servants\n53\nwith a warning to the world to prepare for that great event. Multitudes have\nbeen living in transgression of God\u2019s law, and now He in mercy calls them\nto obey its sacred precepts. All who will put away their sins by repentance\ntoward God and faith in Christ, are offered pardon.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets,\n102.\nThe condition of things in the world shows that troublous times are right\nupon us. The daily papers are full of indications of a terrible con\ufb02ict in the\nnear future. Bold robberies are of frequent occurrence. Strikes are common.\nThefts and murders are committed on every hand. Men possessed of demons\nare taking the lives of men, women, and little children. Men have become\ninfatuated with vice, and every species of evil prevails.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:11.\nThe Archdeceiver at Work\nAt the present time, when the end of all things earthly is rapidly\napproaching, Satan is putting forth desperate efforts to ensnare the world. He\nis devising many plans to occupy minds, and to divert attention from the truths\nessential to salvation. In every city his agencies are busily organizing into\nparties those who are opposed to the law of God. The archdeceiver is at work\nto introduce elements of confusion and rebellion, and men are being \ufb01red with\na zeal that is not according to knowledge.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 219.\nSatan is a diligent Bible student. He knows that his time is short, and\nhe seeks at every point to counterwork the work of the Lord upon this\nearth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:16.\nSatan is now seeking to hold God\u2019s people in a state of inactivity, to\nkeep them from acting their part in spreading the truth, that they may at last\nbe weighed in the balance and found wanting.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:260.\nWorld Stirred With the Spirit of War\nThe world is stirred with the spirit of war. The prophecy of the eleventh\nchapter of Daniel has nearly reached its complete ful\ufb01llment. Soon the scenes\nof trouble spoken of in the prophecies will take place.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:14.\n54\nI was shown the inhabitants of the earth in the utmost confusion. War,\nbloodshed, privation, want, famine, and pestilence were abroad in the land....\nMy attention was then called from the scene. There seemed to be a little time\nof peace. Once more the inhabitants of the earth were presented before me;\nand again everything was in the utmost confusion. Strife, war, and bloodshed,\nwith famine and pestilence, raged everywhere. Other nations were engaged\nin this war and confusion. War caused famine. Want and bloodshed caused\npestilence. And then men\u2019s hearts failed them for fear, \u201cand for looking after\nthose things which are coming on the earth.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:268.\nSpiritual Darkness\nThis is a time of spiritual darkness in the churches of the world. Ignorance\nof divine things has hidden God and the truth from view. The forces of evil are\ngathering in strength. Satan \ufb02atters his coworkers that he will do a work that\nwill captivate the world. While partial inactivity has come upon the church,\nSatan and his hosts are intensely active. The professed Christian churches are\nnot converting the world; for they are themselves corrupted with sel\ufb01shness\nand pride, and need to feel the converting power of God in their midst before\nthey can lead others to a purer or higher standard.\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n9:65.\nIn our day, as of old, the vital truths of God\u2019s word are set aside for human\ntheories and speculations. Many professed ministers of the gospel do not\naccept the whole Bible as the inspired word. One wise man rejects one portion;\nanother questions another part. They set up their judgment as superior to the\nWord; and the Scripture which they do teach rests upon their own authority.\nIts divine authenticity is destroyed. Thus the seeds of in\ufb01delity are sown\nbroadcast; for the people become confused, and know not what to believe.\nThere are many beliefs that the mind has no right to entertain.\u2014 Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons, 39.\nWickedness is reaching a height never before attained, and yet many\nministers of the gospel are crying, \u201cPeace\n55\nand safety.\u201d But God\u2019s faithful messengers are to go steadily forward with\ntheir work. Clothed with the panoply of heaven, they are to advance fearlessly\nand victoriously, never ceasing their warfare until every soul within their\nreach shall have received the message of truth for this time.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 220.\nThere is a cause for alarm in the condition of the religious world today.\nGod\u2019s mercy has been tri\ufb02ed with. The multitude make void the law of\nJehovah, \u201cteaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u201d In\ufb01delity\nprevails in many of the churches in our land; not in\ufb01delity in its broadest\nsense,\u2014an open denial of the Bible,\u2014but an in\ufb01delity that is robed in the garb\nof Christianity, while it is undermining faith in the Bible as a revelation from\nGod. Fervent devotion and vital piety have given place to hollow formalism.\nAs the result, apostasy and sensualism prevail. Christ declared, \u201cAs it was in\nthe days of Lot, ... even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is\nrevealed.\u201d The daily record of passing events testi\ufb01es to the ful\ufb01llment of His\nwords. The world is fast becoming ripe for destruction. Soon the judgments of\nGod are to be poured out, and sin and sinners are to be consumed.\u2014Patriarchs\nand Prophets, 166.\nSeparating the Wheat From the Tares\nThe time of God\u2019s destructive judgments is the time of mercy for those\nwho have had no opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly will the Lord\nlook upon them. His heart of mercy is touched; His hand is still stretched out\nto save, while the door is closed to those who would not enter.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:97.\nSoon the battle will be waged \ufb01ercely between those who serve God and\nthose who serve Him not. Soon everything that can be shaken will be shaken,\nthat those things that cannot be shaken may remain.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:15, 16.\nIn the time of distress and perplexity of nations there will be many who\nhave not given themselves wholly to the corrupting in\ufb02uences of the world\nand the service of Satan, who will humble themselves before God, and turn to\nHim\n56\nwith their whole heart and \ufb01nd acceptance and pardon.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 1:269.\nThere are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot understand\ntheir true import. All over the world men and women are looking wistfully to\nheaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for\ngrace, for the Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only\nto be gathered in.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 109.\nLessons From Elijah\u2019s Experience\nFrom Elijah\u2019s experience during those days of discouragement and\napparent defeat, there are many lessons to be drawn,\u2014lessons invaluable to\nthe servants of God in this age, marked as it is by general departure from\nright. The apostasy prevailing today is similar to that which in the prophet\u2019s\nday overspread Israel. In the exaltation of the human above the divine, in the\npraise of popular leaders, in the worship of mammon, and in the placing of\nthe teachings of science above the truths of revelation, multitudes today are\nfollowing after Baal. Doubt and unbelief are exercising their baleful in\ufb02uence\nover mind and heart, and many are substituting for the oracles of God the\ntheories of men. It is publicly taught that we have reached a time when\nhuman reason should be exalted above the teachings of the Word. The law of\nGod, the divine standard of righteousness, is declared to be of no effect. The\nenemy of all truth is working with deceptive power to cause men and women\nto place human institutions where God should be, and to forget that which\nwas ordained for the happiness and salvation of mankind. Yet this apostasy,\nwidespread as it has come to be, is not universal. Not all in the world are\nlawless and sinful; not all have taken sides with the enemy. God has many\nthousands who have not bowed the knee to Baal, many who long to understand\nmore fully in regard to Christ and the law, many who are hoping against hope\nthat Jesus will come soon to end the reign of sin and death. And there are\nmany who have been worshiping Baal ignorantly, but with whom the Spirit of\nGod is still striving.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 170, 171.\n57\nChap. 5 - The Church a Training Center\nThe Need of the Hour\nThat which is needed now for the upbuilding of our churches is the nice\nwork of wise laborers to discern and develop talent in the church,\u2014talent that\ncan be educated for the Master\u2019s use. There should be a well organized plan\nfor the employment of workers to go into all our churches, large and small,\nto instruct the members how to labor for the upbuilding of the church, and\nalso for unbelievers. It is training, education, that is needed. Those who\nlabor in visiting the churches should give the brethren and sisters instruction\nin practical methods of doing missionary work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:117.\nGod expects His church to discipline and \ufb01t its members for the work of\nenlightening the world. An education should be given that would result in\nfurnishing hundreds who would put out to the exchangers valuable talents. By\nthe use of these talents, men would be developed who would be prepared to \ufb01ll\npositions of trust and in\ufb02uence, and to maintain pure, uncorrupted principles.\nThus great good would be accomplished for the Master.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:431, 432.\nEvery worker should be understandingly ef\ufb01cient. Then in a high, broad\nsense he can present the truth as it is in Jesus.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:70.\nThere should be no delay in this well-planned effort to educate the church\nmembers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:119.\nThe greatest help that can be given our people is to teach them to work\nfor God, and to depend on Him, not on the ministers.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 7:19.\nIt is evident that all the sermons that have been preached have not\ndeveloped a large class of self-denying workers. This subject is to be\nconsidered as involving the most serious results. Our future for eternity is\nat stake. The churches are withering up because they have failed to use their\ntalents in diffusing light. Careful instruction should\n58\nbe given which will be as lessons from the Master, that all may put their light\nto practical use.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:431.\nThe people have had too much sermonizing; but have they been taught\nhow to labor for those for whom Christ died? Has a line of labor been devised\nand placed before them in such a way that each has seen the necessity of taking\npart in the work?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:431.\nIt is by education and practice that persons are to be quali\ufb01ed to meet any\nemergency which may arise; and wise planning is needed to place each one\nin his proper sphere, that he may obtain an experience that will \ufb01t him to bear\nresponsibility.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:221.\nThe Church Missionary Curriculum\nMany would be willing to work if they were taught how to begin. They\nneed to be instructed and encouraged. Every church should be a training\nschool for Christian workers. Its members should be taught how to give Bible\nreadings, how to conduct and teach Sabbath school classes, how best to help\nthe poor and to care for the sick, how to work for the unconverted. There\nshould be schools of health, cooking schools, and classes in various lines of\nChristian help work. There should not only be teaching, but actual work under\nexperienced instructors. Let the teachers lead the way in working among the\npeople, and others, uniting with them, will learn from their example. One\nexample is worth more than many precepts.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 149.\nSpecial Training\nGreater efforts should be put forth to educate the people in the principles\nof health reform. Cooking schools should be established, and house-to-house\ninstruction should be given in the art of cooking wholesome food. Old and\nyoung should learn how to cook more simply. Wherever the truth is presented,\nthe people are to be taught how to prepare food in a simple, yet appetizing way.\nThey are to be shown that a nourishing diet can be provided without the use\nof \ufb02esh foods.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:161.\n59\nIn every place where there is a church, instruction should be given in regard\nto the preparation of simple, wholesome foods, for the use of those who wish\nto live in accordance with the principles of health. And the church members\nshould impart to the people of their neighborhoods the light they receive on\nthis subject.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 362.\nAdapt the Instruction\nHow many useful and honored workers in God\u2019s cause have received a\ntraining amid the humble duties of the most lowly positions in life! Moses\nwas the prospective ruler of Egypt, but God could not take him from the king\u2019s\ncourt to do the work appointed him. Only when he had been for forty years\na faithful shepherd was he sent to be the deliverer of his people. Gideon was\ntaken from the threshing \ufb02oor to be the instrument in the hands of God for\ndelivering the armies of Israel. Elisha was called to leave the plow and do\nthe bidding of God. Amos was a husbandman, a tiller of the soil, when God\ngave him a message to proclaim. All who become coworkers with Christ will\nhave a great deal of hard, uncongenial labor to perform, and their lessons\nof instruction should be wisely chosen, and adapted to their peculiarities of\ncharacter, and the work which they are to pursue.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 332, 333.\nResponsibility for Providing the Training\nWhen men of promise and ability were converted, as in the case of\nTimothy, Paul and Barnabas sought earnestly to show them the necessity\nof laboring in the vineyard. And when the apostles left for another place,\nthe faith of these men did not fail, but rather increased. They had been\nfaithfully instructed in the way of the Lord, and had been taught how to labor\nunsel\ufb01shly, earnestly, perseveringly, for the salvation of their fellow men. This\ncareful training of new converts was an important factor in the remarkable\nsuccess that attended Paul and Barnabas as they preached the gospel in heathen\nlands.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 186, 187.\n60\nAs churches are established, it should be set before them that it is even\nfrom among them that men must be taken to carry the truth to others, and raise\nnew churches; therefore they must all work, and cultivate to the utmost the\ntalents that God has given them, and be training their minds to engage in the\nservice of their Master.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:205.\nMissionary operations are constantly embarrassed for want of workers\nof the right class of mind,\u2014workers who have devotion and piety that\nwill correctly represent our faith. There are many who ought to become\nmissionaries, but who never enter the \ufb01eld because those who are united with\nthem in church capacity or in our colleges do not feel the burden to labor with\nthem, to open before them the claims of God upon all their powers, and do not\npray with and for them.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 500,\n501.\nThose who have the spiritual oversight of the church should devise ways\nand means by which an opportunity may be given to every member of the\nchurch to act some part in God\u2019s work. Too often in the past this has not\nbeen done. Plans have not been clearly laid and fully carried out, whereby\nthe talents of all might be employed in active service. There are but few who\nrealize how much has been lost because of this.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:116.\nIn every church the members should be so trained that they will devote\ntime to the winning of souls to Christ. How can it be said of the church,\n\u201cYe are the light of the world,\u201d unless the members of the church are actually\nimparting light? Let those who have charge of the \ufb02ock of Christ awake to\ntheir duty, and set many souls to work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:436.\nSelect Of\ufb01cers Quali\ufb01ed to Train\nGreat care should be exercised in selecting of\ufb01cers for the new churches.\nLet them be men and women who are thoroughly converted. Let those be\nchosen who are best quali\ufb01ed to give instruction, those who can minister\nboth in word and in deed. There is a deep-seated necessity for work in every\nline.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:85.\n61\nThe elders and those who have leading places in the church should give\nmore thought to their plans for conducting the work. They should arrange\nmatters so that every member of the church shall have a part to act, that none\nmay lead an aimless life, but that all may accomplish what they can according\nto their several ability.... It is very essential that such an education should be\ngiven to the members of the church that they will become unsel\ufb01sh, devoted,\nef\ufb01cient workers for God; and it is only through such a course that the church\ncan be prevented from becoming fruitless and dead.... Let every member of\nthe church become an active worker,\u2014a living stone, emitting light in God\u2019s\ntemple.\u2014 The Review and Herald, September 2, 1890.\nChurch Members to Educate Themselves\nChurch members must work; they must educate themselves , striving to\nreach the high standard set before them. This the Lord will help them to reach\nif they will co-operate with Him.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:140.\nWe should not let slip even one opportunity of qualifying ourselves\nintellectually to work for God.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 334.\nThe Divine Standard\nThe Lord desires us to obtain all the education possible, with the object\nin view of imparting our knowledge to others. None can know where or how\nthey may be called to labor or to speak for God. Our heavenly Father alone\nsees what He can make of men. There are before us possibilities which our\nfeeble faith does not discern. Our minds should be so trained that if necessary\nwe can present the truths of His word before the highest earthly authorities in\nsuch a way as to glorify His name.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 333, 334.\nWho have been preparing themselves to go and work in His vineyard? God\nis not pleased with novices. He wants us to make the very best and highest use\nthat is possible of the talents that He has given us.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nApril 2, 1889.\n62\nIllustration\nI had dreamed that a person brought to me a web of white cloth, and\nbade me cut it into garments for persons of all sizes, and all descriptions of\ncharacter, and circumstances in life. I was told to cut them out, and hang them\nup all ready to be made when called for. I had the impression that many for\nwhom I was required to cut garments were unworthy. I inquired if that was\nthe last piece of cloth I should have to cut, and was told that it was not; that as\nsoon as I had \ufb01nished this one, there were others for me to take hold of.\nI felt discouraged at the amount of work before me, and stated that I\nhad been engaged in cutting garments for others for more than twenty years,\nand my labors had not been appreciated, neither did I see that my work had\naccomplished much good. I spoke to the person who brought the cloth to me,\nof one woman in particular, for whom he had told me to cut a garment. I\nstated that she would not prize the garment, and that it would be a loss of time\nand material to present it to her. She was very poor, of inferior intellect, and\nuntidy in her habits, and would soon soil it. The person replied, \u201cCut out the\ngarments. That is your duty. The loss is not yours, but mine. God sees not as\nman sees. He lays out the work that He would have done, and you do not know\nwhich will prosper, this or that. It will be found that many such poor souls will\ngo into the kingdom, while others, who are favored with all the blessings of\nlife, having all the advantages of improvement, will be left out.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 2:10, 11.\nFor hours, soldiers are drilled to disencumber themselves of their\nknapsacks, and place them quickly in position again upon the person. They\nare taught how to stack their arms, and how to seize them quickly. They\nare drilled in making a charge against the enemy, and are trained in all kinds\nof maneuvers. Thus the drill goes on, preparing men for any emergency.\nAnd should those who are \ufb01ghting the battle for Prince Emmanuel be less\nearnest and painstaking in their preparation for the spiritual warfare?\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 75.\n63\nChap. 6 - Students to do Missionary\nWork While in Training\nObject of Education\nTrue education is missionary training. Every son and daughter of God is\ncalled to be a missionary; we are called to the service of God and our fellow\nmen; and to \ufb01t us for this service should be the object of our education.\u2014 The\nMinistry of Healing, 395.\nIt is to fortify the youth against the temptations of the enemy that we have\nestablished schools where they may be quali\ufb01ed for usefulness in this life and\nfor the service of God throughout eternity.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers,\nand Students, 495.\nHe who strives to obtain knowledge in order that he may labor for the\nignorant and perishing, is acting his part in ful\ufb01lling God\u2019s great purpose for\nmankind. In unsel\ufb01sh service for the blessing of others he is meeting the high\nideal of Christian education.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,\n545.\nThe Lord calls for strong, devoted, self-sacri\ufb01cing young men and women,\nwho will press to the front, and who, after a short time spent in school, will\ngo forth prepared to give the message to the world.\u2014 Counsels to Parents ,\nTeachers, and Students, 549.\nLearning by Doing\nIt is necessary to their complete education that students be given time to\ndo missionary work\u2014time to become acquainted with the spiritual needs of\nthe families in the community around them. They should not be so loaded\ndown with studies that they have no time to use the knowledge they have\nacquired. They should be encouraged to make earnest missionary effort for\nthose in error, becoming acquainted with them, and taking to them the truth.\nBy working in humility, seeking wisdom from Christ, praying and watching\nunto prayer, they may give to others the knowledge that has enriched their\nlives.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 545, 546.\n64\nWherever possible, students should, during the school year, engage in city\nmission work. They should do missionary work in the surrounding towns and\nvillages. They can form themselves into bands to do Christian help work.\nStudents should take a broad view of their present obligations to God. They\nare not to look forward to a time, after the school term closes, when they will\ndo some large work for God, but should study how, during their student life,\nto yoke up with Christ in unsel\ufb01sh service for others.\u2014 Counsels to Parents,\nTeachers, and Students, 547.\nIt is not enough to \ufb01ll the minds of the youth with lessons of deep\nimportance; they must learn to impart what they have received.\u2014 Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Students, 545.\nFrom our colleges and training schools missionaries are to be sent forth\nto distant lands. While at school, let the students improve every opportunity\nto prepare for this work. Here they are to be tested and proved, that it may\nbe seen what their adaptability is, and whether they have a right hold from\nabove.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 549.\nEncourage a Missionary Spirit\nThe teachers and students in our schools need the divine touch. God can\ndo much more for them than He has done, because in the past His way has\nbeen restricted. If a missionary spirit is encouraged, even if it takes some\nhours from the program of regular study, much of Heaven\u2019s blessing will be\ngiven, provided there is more faith and spiritual zeal, more of a realization of\nwhat God will do.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 546.\nWhen School Closes\nWhen school closes, there is opportunity for many to go out into the \ufb01eld\nas evangelistic canvassers. The faithful colporteur \ufb01nds his way into many\nhomes, where he leaves reading matter containing the truth for this time. Our\nstudents should learn how to sell our books. There is need of men of deep\nChristian experience, men of well-balanced minds, strong, well-educated men,\nto engage in this branch of the work. Some have the talent, education, and\nexperience\n65\nthat would enable them to educate the youth for canvassing work in such\na way that much more would be accomplished than is now being done.\nThose who have this experience have a special duty to perform in teaching\nothers.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 546, 547.\nThe Ministry of Song\nStudents who have learned to sing sweet gospel songs with melody and\ndistinctness, can do much good as singing evangelists. They will \ufb01nd many\nopportunities to use the talent that God has given them in carrying melody and\nsunshine into many lonely places darkened by sorrow and af\ufb02iction, singing\nto those who seldom have church privileges.\nStudents, go out into the highways and hedges. Endeavor to reach the\nhigher as well as the lower classes. Enter the homes of the rich as well as the\npoor, and as you have opportunity, ask, \u201cWould you be pleased to have us sing\nsome gospel hymns?\u201d Then as hearts are softened, the way may open for you\nto offer a few words of prayer for the blessing of God. Not many will refuse\nto listen. Such ministry is genuine missionary work.\u2014 Counsels to Parents,\nTeachers, and Students, 547, 548.\n66\nChap. 7 - Co-operation of Ministers and\nLaymen\nUnitedly Enter the Field of Service Let ministers and lay members\ngo forth into the ripening \ufb01elds. They will \ufb01nd their harvest wherever\nthey proclaim the forgotten truths of the Bible. They will \ufb01nd those who\nwill accept the truth, and who will devote their lives to winning souls to\nChrist.\u2014Australian The Signs of the Times, August 3, 1903.\nIt is not the Lord\u2019s purpose that ministers should be left to do the greatest\npart of the work of sowing the seeds of truth. Men who are not called to the\nministry are to be encouraged to labor for the Master according to their several\nability. Hundreds of men and women now idle could do acceptable service.\nBy carrying the truth into the homes of their friends and neighbors, they could\ndo a great work for the Master.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:21.\nGod has given His ministers the message of truth to proclaim. This the\nchurches are to receive, and in every possible way to communicate, catching\nthe \ufb01rst rays of light and diffusing them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:425.\nThe people must lift where the minister lifts, thus seconding his efforts\nand helping him bear his burdens, and then he will not be overworked and\nbecome discouraged. There is no in\ufb02uence that can be brought to bear on a\nchurch that will be enduring unless the people shall move intelligently, from\nprinciple, to do all they can to forward the work.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nAugust 23, 1881.\nA Convincing Combination\nThe world will be convinced, not by what the pulpit teaches, but by what\nthe church lives. The minister in the desk announces the theory of the gospel;\nthe practical piety of the church demonstrates its power.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 7:16.\n67\nThe work of God in this earth can never be \ufb01nished until the men and\nwomen comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite their\nefforts with those of ministers and church of\ufb01cers.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 352.\nPreaching is a small part of the work to be done for the salvation of souls.\nGod\u2019s Spirit convicts sinners of the truth, and He places them in the arms of\nthe church. The ministers may do their part, but they can never perform the\nwork that the church should do.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:69.\nThe dissemination of the truth of God is not con\ufb01ned to a few ordained\nministers. The truth is to be scattered by all who claim to be disciples of\nChrist. It must be sown beside all waters.\u2014 The Review and Herald, August\n22, 1899.\nMinisters may preach pleasing and forcible discourses, and much labor\nmay be put forth to build up and make the church prosperous; but unless\nits individual members shall act their part as servants of Jesus Christ, the\nchurch will ever be in darkness and without strength. Hard and dark as the\nworld is, the in\ufb02uence of a really consistent example will be a power for\ngood.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:285, 286.\nA Fatal Mistake\nIt is a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of soulsaving depends alone\nupon the ministry. The humble, consecrated believer upon whom the Master\nof the vineyard places a burden for souls, is to be given encouragement by the\nmen upon whom the Lord has laid larger responsibilities. Those who stand\nas leaders in the church of God are to realize that the Saviour\u2019s commission\nis given to all who believe in His name. God will send forth into His\nvineyard many who have not been dedicated to the ministry by the laying\non of hands.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 110.\nThe idea that the minister must carry all the burdens and do all the work,\nis a great mistake. Overworked and broken down, he may go into the grave,\nwhen, had the burden been shared as the Lord designed, he might have lived.\nThat the burden may be distributed, an education must be given to the church\nby those who can teach the\n68\nworkers to follow Christ and to work as He worked.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:435.\nThe minister should not feel that it is his duty to do all the talking and all\nthe laboring and all the praying; he should educate helpers in every church. Let\ndifferent ones take turns in leading the meetings, and in giving Bible readings;\nin so doing they will be calling into use the talents which God has given them,\nand at the same time be receiving a training as workers.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n197.\nMinisters should not do the work which belongs to the church, thus\nwearying themselves, and preventing others from performing their duty.\nThey should teach the members how to labor in the church and in the\ncommunity.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 291.\nWhen an effort is made to present our faith to unbelievers, the members of\nthe church too often stand back, as if they were not an interested party, and let\nall the burden rest upon the minister. For this reason the labor of our most able\nministers has been at times productive of little good.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 196.\nThe Minister\u2019s Duty\nThe best help that ministers can give the members of our churches is not\nsermonizing, but planning work for them. Give each one something to do for\nothers. Help all to see that as receivers of the grace of Christ they are under\nobligation to work for Him. And let all be taught how to work. Especially\nshould those who are newly come to the faith be educated to become laborers\ntogether with God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:82.\nMinisters, preach the truths that will lead to personal labor for those\nwho are out of Christ. Encourage personal effort in every possible\nway.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:124.\nLet ministers teach church members that in order to grow in spirituality,\nthey must carry the burden that the Lord has laid upon them,\u2014the burden of\nleading souls into the truth. Those who are not ful\ufb01lling their responsibility\nshould be visited, prayed with, labored for. Do not lead people to depend upon\nyou as ministers; teach them rather\n69\nthat they are to use their talents in giving the truth to those around them. In thus\nworking they will have the co-operation of heavenly angels, and will obtain\nan experience that will increase their faith, and give them a strong hold on\nGod.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 200.\nIn laboring where there are already some in the faith, the minister should\nat \ufb01rst seek not so much to convert unbelievers, as to train the church members\nfor acceptable co-operation. Let him labor for them individually, endeavoring\nto arouse them to seek for a deeper experience themselves, and to work for\nothers. When they are prepared to sustain the minister by their prayers and\nlabors, greater success will attend his efforts.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 196.\nIn some respects the pastor occupies a position similar to that of the\nforeman of a gang of laboring men or the captain of a ship\u2019s crew. They\nare expected to see that the men over whom they are set, do the work assigned\nto them correctly and promptly, and only in case of emergency are they to\nexecute in detail. The owner of a large mill once found his superintendent in\na wheel-pit, making some simple repairs, while a half-dozen workmen in that\nline were standing by, idly looking on. The proprietor, after learning the facts,\nso as to be sure that no injustice was done, called the foreman to his of\ufb01ce and\nhanded him his discharge with full pay. In surprise the foreman asked for an\nexplanation. It was given in these words: \u201cI employed you to keep six men\nat work. I found the six idle, and you doing the work of but one. Your work\ncould have been done just as well by any one of the six. I cannot afford to pay\nthe wages of seven for you to teach the six how to be idle.\u201d\nThis incident may be applicable in some cases, and in others not. But many\npastors fail in not knowing how, or in not trying, to get the full membership\nof the church actively engaged in the various departments of church work. If\npastors would give more attention to getting and keeping their \ufb02ock actively\nengaged at work, they would accomplish more good, have more time for\nstudy and religious visiting, and also avoid many causes of friction.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 197, 198.\n70\nA Good Example\nThe apostle [Paul] felt that he was to a large extent responsible for the\nspiritual welfare of those converted under his labors. His desire for them was\nthat they might increase in a knowledge of the only true God, and Jesus Christ,\nwhom He had sent. Often in his ministry he would meet with little companies\nof men and women who loved Jesus, and bow with them in prayer, asking God\nto teach them how to maintain a living connection with Him. Often he took\ncounsel with them as to the best methods of giving to others the light of gospel\ntruth. And often, when separated from those for whom he had thus labored, he\npleaded with God to keep them from evil, and help them to be earnest, active\nmissionaries.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 262.\n71\nChap. 8 - Organizing Christian Forces\nOrganization Essential Time is short, and our forces must be organized\nto do a larger work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:27.\nThe formation of small companies as a basis of Christian effort has been\npresented to me by One who cannot err.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church 7:21,\n22.\nLet there be in every church, well-organized companies of workers to labor\nin the vicinity of that church.\u2014 The Review and Herald, September 29, 1891.\nIn every city there should be a corps of organized, well-disciplined\nworkers; not merely one or two, but scores should be set to work.\u2014 The\nGeneral Conference Bulletin, 1893, 37.\nIn our churches let companies be formed for service. Let different ones\nunite in labor as \ufb01shers of men. Let them seek to gather souls from the\ncorruption of the world into the saving purity of Christ\u2019s love.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 7:21.\nThe church of Christ on earth was organized for missionary purposes, and\nthe Lord desires to see the entire church devising ways and means whereby\nhigh and low, rich and poor, may hear the message of truth.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 6:29.\nIf there is a large number in the church, let the members be formed\ninto small companies, to work not only for the church members, but for\nunbelievers. If in one place there are only two or three who know the truth,\nlet them form themselves into a band of workers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:22.\nIf discipline and order are necessary for successful action on the battle\ufb01eld,\nthe same are as much more needful in the warfare in which we are engaged as\nthe object to be gained is of greater value and more elevated in character, than\nthose for which opposing forces contend upon the \ufb01eld\n72\nof battle. In the con\ufb02ict in which we are engaged, eternal interests are at\nstake.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:649.\nGod is a God of order. Everything connected with heaven is in perfect\norder; subjection and thorough discipline mark the movements of the angelic\nhost. Success can only attend order and harmonious action. God requires\norder and system in His work now no less than in the days of Israel. All who\nare working for Him are to labor intelligently, not in a careless, haphazard\nmanner. He would have His work done with faith and exactness, that He may\nplace the seal of His approval upon it.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 376.\nWell-organized work must be done in the church, that its members may\nunderstand how to impart the light to others, and thus strengthen their own\nfaith and increase their knowledge. As they impart that which they have\nreceived from God, they will be con\ufb01rmed in the faith. A working church\nis a living church. We are built up as living stones, and every stone is to emit\nlight. Every Christian is compared to a precious stone that catches the glory\nof God and re\ufb02ects it.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:435.\nLessons in Perfect Organization\nHe [God] designs that we should learn lessons of order and organization\nfrom the perfect order instituted in the days of Moses, for the bene\ufb01t of the\nchildren of Israel.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:653.\nFirst Step in Church Organization\nIt was at the ordination of the twelve that the \ufb01rst step was taken in the\norganization of the church that after Christ\u2019s departure was to carry on His\nwork on the earth.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 18.\nModel Church Organization\nThe organization of the church at Jerusalem was to serve as a model for\nthe organization of churches in every other place where messengers of truth\nshould win converts to the gospel.... Later in the history of the early church,\nwhen in various parts of the world many groups of believers had\n73\nbeen formed into churches, the organization of the church was further\nperfected, so that order and harmonious action might be maintained. Every\nmember was exhorted to act well his part. Each was to make a wise use of the\ntalents intrusted to him.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 91, 92.\nFitting Each Into His Place\nEvery one who is added to the ranks by conversion is to be assigned his\npost of duty. Every one should be willing to be or to do anything in this\nwarfare.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:30.\nIt is not numerous institutions, large buildings, or great display that God\nrequires, but the harmonious action of a peculiar people, a people chosen\nby God and precious. Every man is to stand in his lot and place, thinking,\nspeaking, and acting in harmony with the Spirit of God. Then, and not till\nthen, will the work be a complete, symmetrical whole.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:293.\nThe strength of an army is measured largely by the ef\ufb01ciency of the men in\nthe ranks. A wise general instructs his of\ufb01cers to train every soldier for active\nservice. He seeks to develop the highest ef\ufb01ciency on the part of all. If he were\nto depend on his of\ufb01cers alone, he could never expect to conduct a successful\ncampaign. He counts on loyal and untiring service from every man in his army.\nThe responsibility rests largely upon the men in the ranks.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:116.\nThe Master calls for gospel workers. Who will respond? Not all who\nenter the army are to be generals, captains, sergeants, or even corporals. Not\nall have the care and responsibility of leaders. There is hard work of other\nkinds to be done. Some must dig trenches and build forti\ufb01cations; some are to\nstand as sentinels; some to carry messages. While there are but few of\ufb01cers,\nit requires many soldiers to form the rank and \ufb01le of the army; yet its success\ndepends upon the \ufb01delity of every soldier. One man\u2019s cowardice or treachery\nmay bring disaster upon the entire army.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 84, 85.\n74\nThe Secret of Success\nThe secret of our success in the work of God will be found in the\nharmonious working of our people. There must be concentrated action.\nEvery member of the body of Christ must act his part in the cause of God,\naccording to the ability that God has given him. We must press together\nagainst obstructions and dif\ufb01culties, shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, December 2, 1890.\nIf Christians were to act in concert, moving forward as one, under the\ndirection of one Power, for the accomplishment of one purpose, they would\nmove the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:221.\nAngels work harmoniously. Perfect order characterizes all their\nmovements. The more closely we imitate the harmony and order of the\nangelic host, the more successful will be the efforts of these heavenly agents\nin our behalf. If we see no necessity for harmonious action, and are\ndisorderly, undisciplined, and disorganized in our course of action, angels,\nwho are thoroughly organized and move in perfect order, cannot work for us\nsuccessfully. They turn away in grief, for they are not authorized to bless\nconfusion, distraction, and disorganization. All who desire the cooperation of\nthe heavenly messengers, must work in unison with them. Those who have\nthe unction from on high, will in all their efforts encourage order, discipline,\nand union of action, and then the angels of God can co-operate with them.\nBut never, never will these heavenly messengers place their indorsement upon\nirregularity, disorganization, and disorder.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:649,\n650.\nTimely Warning\nThere is need of systematic labor; but where some of you are so long in\ndevising, and planning, and getting ready for the work, Satan preoccupies the\n\ufb01eld with bewitching fables, and the attention of men becomes absorbed in the\ndelusions of the master deceiver.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nO how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to get in\namong this people, and disorganize the\n75\nwork at a time when thorough organization is essential, and will be the greatest\npower to keep out spurious uprisings, and to refute claims not indorsed by the\nWord of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be no breaking\ndown of the system of organization and order that has been built up by wise,\ncareful labor. License must not be given to disorderly elements that desire to\ncontrol the work at this time.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 487.\n76\nChap. 9 - The Call to Arouse\nThe Summons\nLet the gospel message ring through our churches, summoning them to\nuniversal action. Let the members of the church have increased faith, gaining\nzeal from their unseen, heavenly allies, from a knowledge of their exhaustless\nresources, from the greatness of the enterprise in which they are engaged, and\nfrom the power of their Leader. Those who place themselves under God\u2019s\ncontrol, to be led and guided by Him, will catch the steady tread of the events\nordained by Him to take place. Inspired with the Spirit of Him who gave\nHis life for the life of the world, they will no longer stand still in impotency,\npointing to what they cannot do. Putting on the armor of heaven, they will\ngo forth to the warfare willing to do and dare for God, knowing that His\nomnipotence will supply their need.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:14.\nLet us arouse! The battle is waging. Truth and error are nearing their \ufb01nal\ncon\ufb02ict. Let us march under the blood-stained banner of Prince Emmanuel,\nand \ufb01ght the good \ufb01ght of faith, and win eternal honors; for the truth will\ntriumph, and we may be more than conquerors through Him who has loved us.\nThe precious hours of probation are closing. Let us make sure work for eternal\nlife, that we may glorify our heavenly Father, and be the means of saving souls\nfor whom Christ died.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nMarching Orders\nThe duke of Wellington was once present where a party of Christian men\nwere discussing the possibility of success in missionary effort among the\nheathen. They appealed to the duke to say whether in his judgment such\nefforts were likely to prove a success commensurate to the cost. The old\nsoldier replied: \u201cGentlemen, what are your marching orders? Success is not\nthe question for you to discuss. If I read your orders aright, they run thus, \u2018Go\nye into all\n77\nthe world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u2019 Gentlemen, obey your\nmarching orders.\u201d\u2014 Gospel Workers, 115.\nNo Time for Delay\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:14. Let us be shod with the gospel shoes, ready to march at a\nmoment\u2019s notice.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:48.\nChurch members ... are to be ever ready to spring into action in obedience\nto the Master\u2019s commands. Wherever we see work waiting to be done, we\nare to take it up and do it, constantly looking unto Jesus.... If every church\nmember were a living missionary, the gospel would speedily be proclaimed in\nall countries, to all peoples, nations, and tongues.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:32.\nWe are nearing the close of this earth\u2019s history. We have before us a great\nwork,\u2014the closing work of giving the last warning message to a sinful world.\nThere are men who will be taken from the plow, from the vineyard, from\nvarious other branches of work, and sent forth by the Lord to give this message\nto the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:270.\nSound an alarm throughout the length and breadth of the earth. Tell the\npeople that the day of the Lord is near, and hasteth greatly. Let none be\nleft unwarned. We might have been in the place of the poor souls that are\nin error. We might have been placed among barbarians. According to the\ntruth we have received above others, we are debtors to impart the same to\nthem.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:22.\nMy brethren and sisters, it is too late to devote your time and strength to\nself-serving. Let not the last day \ufb01nd you destitute of the heavenly treasure.\nSeek to push the triumphs of the cross, seek to enlighten souls, labor for the\nsalvation of your fellow beings, and your work will abide the trying test of\n\ufb01re.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:56.\n78\nWe must give this message quickly, line upon line, precept upon precept.\nMen will soon be forced to great decisions, and it is our duty to see that they\nare given an opportunity to understand the truth, that they may take their stand\nintelligently on the right side. The Lord calls upon His people to labor\u2014labor\nearnestly and wisely\u2014while probation lingers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:126, 127.\nWe have no time to lose. The end is near. The passage from place to\nplace to spread the truth will soon be hedged with dangers on the right hand\nand on the left. Everything will be placed to obstruct the way of the Lord\u2019s\nmessengers, so that they will not be able to do that which it is possible for them\nto do now. We must look our work fairly in the face, and advance as fast as\npossible in aggressive warfare. From the light given me of God I know that the\npowers of darkness are working with intense energy from beneath, and with\nstealthy tread Satan is advancing to take those who are now asleep, as a wolf\ntaking his prey. We have warnings now which we may give, a work now which\nwe may do; but soon it will be more dif\ufb01cult than we can imagine. God help\nus to keep in the channel of light, to work with our eyes fastened on Jesus our\nleader, and patiently, perseveringly press on to gain the victory.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 6:22.\nThere is danger in delay. That soul whom you might have found, that soul\nto whom you might have opened the Scriptures, passes beyond your reach.\nSatan has prepared some net for his feet, and tomorrow he may be working\nout the plans of the archenemy of God. Why delay one day? Why not go to\nwork at once?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:443.\nVigilance and \ufb01delity have been required of Christ\u2019s followers in every\nage; but now that we are standing upon the very verge of the eternal world,\nholding the truths we do, having so great light, so important a work, we must\ndouble our diligence. Every one is to do to the very utmost of his ability. My\nbrother, you endanger your own salvation if you hold back now. God will call\nyou to account if you fail in the work He has assigned you.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:460, 461.\n79\nImportant Questions\nEternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be lifted. What are we\nthinking of, that we cling to our sel\ufb01sh love of ease, while all around us souls\nare perishing?\nHave our hearts become utterly callous?\nCan we not see and understand that we have a work to do in behalf of\nothers?\nMy brethren and sisters, are you among those who, having eyes, see not,\nand having ears, hear not?\nIs it in vain that God has given you a knowledge of His will?\nIs it in vain that He has sent you warning after warning of the nearness of\nthe end?\nDo you believe the declarations of His word concerning what is coming\nupon the world?\nDo you believe that God\u2019s judgments are hanging over the inhabitants of\nthe earth?\nHow, then, can you sit at ease, careless and indifferent?\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:26, 27.\nThe Call to Awake\nThe work is fast closing up, and on every side wickedness is increasing.\nWe have but a short time in which to work. Let us awake from spiritual\nslumber, and consecrate all that we have and are to the Lord. His Spirit will\nabide with true missionaries, furnishing them with power for service.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, April 9, 1903.\nWake up, brethren and sisters, wake up. Sleep no longer. \u201cWhy stand\nye here all the day idle?\u201d Jesus calls you, saying, \u201cGo work today in My\nvineyard.\u201d Whoever has received the Holy Spirit, will make it manifest; for\nall his powers will be employed in the most active service. All who actually\nreceive Christ by faith, work. They feel the burden of souls. God now calls\nupon every one who has a knowledge of the truth, who is a depositary of\nsacred truth, to arise and impart the light of heaven to others.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, December 6, 1893.\nWake up, brethren; for your own soul\u2019s sake, wake up. Without the grace\nof Christ you can do nothing. Work while you can.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nJuly 17, 1906.\n80\nIf our eyes could be open to discern the fallen angels at work with those\nwho feel at ease and consider themselves safe, we would not feel so secure.\nEvil angels are upon our track every moment.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:302.\nGod calls upon all, both preachers and people, to awake. All heaven is\nastir. The scenes of earth\u2019s history are fast closing. We are amid the perils of\nthe last days. Greater perils are before us, and yet we are not awake. This lack\nof activity and earnestness in the cause of God is dreadful. This death stupor\nis from Satan.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:260, 261.\nWhat shall I say to arouse the remnant people of God? I was shown\nthat dreadful scenes are before us; Satan and his angels are bringing all their\npowers to bear upon God\u2019s people. He knows that if they sleep a little longer,\nhe is sure of them, for their destruction is certain.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:263.\nIn these \ufb01nal hours of probation for the sons of men, when the fate of every\nsoul is so soon to be decided forever, the Lord of heaven and earth expects His\nchurch to arouse to action as never before. Those who have been made free in\nChrist through a knowledge of precious truth, are regarded by the Lord Jesus\nas His chosen ones, favored above all other people on the face of the earth;\nand He is counting on them to show forth the praises of Him who hath called\nthem out of darkness into marvelous light. The blessings which are so liberally\nbestowed, are to be communicated to others. The good news of salvation is to\ngo to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 716,\n717.\nNot one in a hundred among us is doing anything beyond engaging in\ncommon, worldly enterprises. We are not half awake to the worth of the souls\nfor whom Christ died.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:148.\nIf the followers of Christ were awake to duty, there would be thousands\nwhere there is one today, proclaiming the gospel in heathen lands. And all\nwho could not personally engage in the work, would yet sustain it with their\nmeans, their sympathy, and their prayers. And there would\n81\nbe far more earnest labor for souls in Christian countries.\u2014 Steps to Christ, 81.\nThousands enjoy great light and precious opportunities, but do nothing\nwith their in\ufb02uence or their money to enlighten others. They do not even take\nthe responsibility of keeping their own souls in the love of God, that they may\nnot become a burden to the church. Such ones would be a burden and a clog\nin heaven. For Christ\u2019s sake, for the truth\u2019s sake, for their own sakes, such\nshould arouse and make diligent work for eternity.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nMarch 1, 1887.\nThe church of Christ may be \ufb01tly compared to an army. The life of every\nsoldier is one of toil, hardship, and danger. On every hand are vigilant foes,\nled on by the prince of the powers of darkness, who never slumbers and never\ndeserts his post. Whenever a Christian is off his guard, this powerful adversary\nmakes a sudden and violent attack. Unless the members of the church are\nactive and vigilant, they will be overcome by his devices.\nWhat if half the soldiers in an army were idling or asleep when ordered\nto be on duty; the result would be defeat, captivity, or death. Should any\nescape from the hands of the enemy, would they be thought worthy of a\nreward? No; they would speedily receive the sentence of death. And is the\nchurch of Christ careless or unfaithful, far more important consequences are\ninvolved. A sleeping army of Christian soldiers\u2014what could be more terrible?\nWhat advance could be made against the world, who are under the control\nof the prince of darkness? Those who stand back indifferently in the day\nof battle, as though they had no interest and felt no responsibility as to the\nissue of the contest, might better change their course or leave the ranks at\nonce.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:394.\nThere Must Be Action\nI was shown God\u2019s people waiting for some change to take place,\u2014a\ncompelling power to take hold of them. But they will be disappointed, for\nthey are wrong. They must act; they must take hold of the work themselves,\nand earnestly cry to God for a true knowledge of the work\n82\nthemselves. The scenes which are passing before us are of suf\ufb01cient\nmagnitude to cause us to arouse, and urge the truth home to the hearts of\nall who will listen. The harvest of the earth is nearly ripe.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 1:261.\nEverything in the universe calls upon those who know the truth to\nconsecrate themselves unreservedly to the proclamation of the truth as it has\nbeen made known to them in the third angel\u2019s message. That which we see and\nhear calls us to our duty. The working of satanic agencies calls every Christian\nto stand in his lot.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:25, 26.\nThe message of Christ\u2019s soon coming is to be given to all the nations of\nthe earth. Vigilant, untiring effort is required to overcome the forces of the\nenemy. Our part is not to sit still and weep and wring our hands, but to arise\nand work for time and for eternity.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, May 29, 1902.\n\u201cDo something, do it soon, with all thy might;\nAn angel\u2019s wing would droop if long at rest;\nAnd God Himself, inactive, were no longer blest.\u201d\n\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:308.\nLet no one think that he is at liberty to fold his hands and do nothing.\nThat any one can be saved in indolence and inactivity is an utter impossibility.\nThink of what Christ accomplished during His earthly ministry. How earnest,\nhow untiring, were His efforts! He allowed nothing to turn Him aside from\nthe work given Him. Are we following in His footsteps?\u2014 The Colporteur\nEvangelist, 38.\nDivine and human agencies are combined in the work of saving souls. God\nhas done His part, and Christian activity is needed now. God calls for this. He\nexpects His people to bear a part in presenting the light of truth to all nations.\nWho will enter into this partnership with the Lord Jesus Christ?\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, March 1, 1887.\nThe church must be a working church if it would be a living church. It\nshould not be content merely to hold its own ground against the opposing\nforces of sin and error, not be content to advance with dilatory step, but it\nshould\n83\nbear the yoke of Christ, and keep step with the Leader, gaining new recruits\nalong the way.\u2014 The Review and Herald, August 4, 1891.\nWe have only a little while to urge the warfare; then Christ will come, and\nthis scene of rebellion will close. Then our last efforts will have been made\nto work with Christ and advance His kingdom. Some who have stood in the\nforefront of the battle, zealously resisting incoming evil, fall at the post of\nduty; others gaze sorrowfully at the fallen heroes, but have no time to cease\nwork. They must close up the ranks, seize the banner from the hand palsied\nby death, and with renewed energy vindicate the truth and the honor of Christ.\nAs never before, resistance must be made against sin,\u2014against the powers of\ndarkness. The time demands energetic and determined activity on the part of\nthose who believe present truth. They should teach the truth by both precept\nand example.\u2014 The Review and Herald, October 25, 1881.\nThe Lord now calls upon Seventh-day Adventists in every locality to\nconsecrate themselves to Him, and to do their very best, according to their\ncircumstances, to assist in His work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:132.\nIdleness and religion do not go hand in hand; and the cause of our great\nde\ufb01ciency in the Christian life and experience is inactivity in the work of God.\nThe muscles of your body will become weak and useless if they are not kept\nin exercise, and it is so with the spiritual nature. If you would be strong, you\nmust exercise your powers.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nWe are to be diligent workers; an idle man is a miserable creature. But\nwhat excuse can be offered for idleness in the great work which Christ gave\nHis life to accomplish? The spiritual faculties cease to exist if they are not\nexercised, and it is Satan\u2019s design that they shall perish. All heaven is actively\nengaged in the work of preparing a people for the second coming of Christ to\nour world, and \u201cwe are laborers together with God.\u201d The end of all things is at\nhand. Now is our opportunity to work.\u2014 The Review and Herald, January 24,\n1893.\n84\nIt is heart missionaries that are needed. Spasmodic efforts will do\nlittle good. We must arrest the attention. We must be deeply in\nearnest.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:45.\nThere are among us those who, if they would take time to consider,\nwould regard their do-nothing position as a sinful neglect of their God-given\ntalents.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:425.\nWhat is our position in the world? We are in the waiting time. But this\nperiod is not to be spent in abstract devotion. Waiting, watching, and vigilant\nworking are to be combined. Our life should not be all bustle and drive and\nplanning about the things of the world, to the neglect of personal piety and of\nthe service that God requires. While we should not be slothful in business,\nwe should be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. The lamp of the soul must\nbe trimmed, and we must have the oil of grace in our vessels with our lamps.\nEvery precaution must be used to prevent spiritual declension, lest the day of\nthe Lord overtake us as a thief.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:276.\nWe are living in an age when there is to be no spiritual idleness. Every\nsoul is to be charged with the heavenly current of life.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 8:169.\nCrowd all the good works you possibly can into this life.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:488.\nJesus would have all who profess His name become earnest workers. It is\nnecessary that every individual member build upon the rock Christ Jesus. A\nstorm is arising that will wrench and test the spiritual foundation of every one\nto the utmost. Therefore avoid the sandbed; hunt for the rock. Dig deep;\nlay your foundation sure. Build, oh, build for eternity! Build with tears,\nwith heartfelt prayers. Let every one of you, from henceforth, make your\nlife beautiful by good works. Calebs are the men most needed in these last\ndays.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:129, 130.\nThe Divine Measurement\nThere is a measurement of character constantly going on. The angels of\nGod are estimating your moral value,\n85\nand ascertaining your needs, and bearing your case to God.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, April 2, 1889.\nWe shall individually be held responsible for doing one jot less than we\nhave ability to do. The Lord measures with exactness every possibility for\nservice. The unused capabilities are as much brought into account as are those\nthat are improved. For all that we might become through the right use of our\ntalents God holds us responsible. We shall be judged according to what we\nought to have done, but did not accomplish because we did not use our powers\nto glorify God. Even if we do not lose our souls, we shall realize in eternity\nthe result of our unused talents. For all the knowledge and ability that we\nmight have gained and did not, there will be an eternal loss.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 363.\nWhat Might Have Been\nIf every soldier of Christ had done his duty, if every watchman on the walls\nof Zion had given the trumpet a certain sound, the world might ere this have\nheard the message of warning. But the work is years behind. While men have\nslept, Satan has stolen a march upon us.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:29.\nLet us now take up the work appointed us, and proclaim the message that\nis to arouse men and women to a sense of their danger. If every Seventh-day\nAdventist had done the work laid upon him, the number of believers would\nnow be much larger than it is. In all the cities of America there would be those\nwho had been led to heed the message to obey the law of God.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:25.\nHad the purpose of God been carried out by His people in giving to\nthe world the message of mercy, Christ would, ere this, have come to the\nearth, and the saints would have received their welcome into the city of\nGod.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:450.\nHeaven\u2019s Register\nThe world needs missionaries, consecrated home missionaries, and no one\nwill be registered in the books of\n86\nheaven as a Christian who has not a missionary spirit.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, August 23, 1892.\nIf the church members do not individually take hold of this work, then they\nshow that they have no living connection with God. Their names are registered\nas slothful servants.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:462, 463.\nIn every religious movement there are some who, while they cannot deny\nthat the cause is God\u2019s, still hold themselves aloof, refusing to make any effort\nto help. It were well for such ones to remember the record kept on high,\u2014that\nbook in which there are no omissions, no mistakes, and out of which they\nwill be judged. There every neglected opportunity to do service for God is\nrecorded; and there, too, every deed of faith and love is held in everlasting\nremembrance.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 639.\nOn the morning of October 23, 1879, about two o\u2019 clock, the Spirit of\nthe Lord rested upon me, and I beheld scenes in the coming judgment....\nTen thousand times ten thousand were assembled before a large throne, upon\nwhich was seated a person of majestic appearance. Several books were before\nHim, and upon the covers of each was written in letters of gold, which\nseemed like a burning \ufb02ame of \ufb01re, \u201cLedger of Heaven.\u201d One of these books\ncontaining the names of those who claim to believe the truth, was then opened.\nImmediately I lost sight of the countless millions about the throne, and only\nthose who were professedly children of the light and of the truth engaged my\nattention....\nAnother book was opened, wherein were recorded the sins of those who\nprofess the truth. Under the general heading of sel\ufb01shness came every other\nsin.... One class were registered as cumberers of the ground. As the piercing\neye of the Judge rested upon these, their sins of neglect were distinctly\nrevealed. With pale, quivering lips they acknowledged that they had been\ntraitors to their holy trust. They had had warnings and privileges but they had\nnot heeded nor improved them. They could now see that they had presumed\ntoo much upon the mercy of God. True, they had not such confessions to make\nas had the vile and basely corrupt; but, like the \ufb01g tree, they were cursed\n87\nbecause they bore no fruit, because they had not put to use the talents intrusted\nto them. This class had made self supreme, laboring only for sel\ufb01sh interests.\nThey were not rich toward God, not having responded to His claims upon\nthem. Although professing to be servants of Christ, they brought no souls to\nHim. Had the cause of God been dependent on their efforts, it would have\nlanguished; for they not only withheld the means lent them of God, but they\nwithheld themselves.... They had allowed others to do the work in the Master\u2019s\nvineyard, and to bear the heaviest responsibilities, while they were sel\ufb01shly\nserving their own temporal interests....\nSaid the Judge, \u201cAll will be justi\ufb01ed by their faith, and judged by\ntheir works.\u201d How vividly then appeared their neglect, and how wise the\narrangement of God in giving to every man a work to do to promote the cause\nand save his fellow men. Each was to demonstrate a living faith in his family\nand in his neighborhood, by showing kindness to the poor, sympathizing with\nthe af\ufb02icted, engaging in missionary labor, and by aiding the cause of God\nwith his means. But, like Meroz, the curse of God rested upon them for what\nthey had not done. They had loved that work which would bring the greatest\npro\ufb01t in this life; and opposite their names in the ledger devoted to good works\nthere was a mournful blank.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:384-386.\nMore Required of Us Than of Our Fathers\nGreater light shines upon us than shone upon our fathers. We cannot be\naccepted or honored of God in rendering the same service, or doing the same\nworks, that our fathers did. In order to be accepted and blessed of God as they\nwere, we must imitate their faithfulness and zeal,\u2014improve our light as they\nimproved theirs, and do as they would have done had they lived in our day. We\nmust walk in the light which shines upon us, otherwise that light will become\ndarkness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:262.\nAn Appeal to the Slothful Church\nIt is a mystery that there are not hundreds at work where now there is but\none. The heavenly universe is\n88\nastonished at the apathy, the coldness, the listlessness of those who\nprofess to be sons and daughters of God. In the truth there is a living\npower.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:42.\nWe can never be saved in indolence and inactivity. There is no such thing\nas a truly converted person living a helpless, useless life. It is not possible for\nus to drift into heaven. No sluggard can enter there.... Those who refuse to\nco-operate with God on earth, would not co-operate with Him in heaven.

So far as work\nfor God is concerned, the pages of their life history present a mournful blank.\nThey are trees in the garden of God, but only cumberers of the ground,\ndarkening with their unproductive boughs the ground which fruit-bearing trees\nmight have occupied.\u2014 The Review and Herald, May 22, 1888.\nThere is danger for those who do little or nothing for Christ.

Draw nigh to\nGod. Stir up the gift that is within you. Let those who have had the opportunity\nto become familiar with the reasons of our faith, now use this knowledge to\nsome purpose.\u2014 Historical Sketches, 288.\nHow can you who repeat the Lord\u2019s prayer, \u201cThy kingdom come, Thy will\nbe done in earth as it is in heaven,\u201d sit at ease in your homes without helping\nto carry the torch of truth to others? How can you lift up your hands before\nGod and ask His blessing upon yourselves and your families, when you are\ndoing so little to help others?\u2014 Historical Sketches, 288.\nThere are among us those who, if they would take time to consider, would\nregard their do-nothing position as a sinful neglect of their God-given talents.\nBrethren and sisters, your Redeemer and all the holy angels are grieved at\nyour hardness of heart. Christ gave His own life to save souls, and yet\nyou who have known His love make so little effort to impart the blessings\nof His grace to those for whom He died. Such indifference and neglect of\nduty is an amazement to the angels. In the judgment you must meet the\nsouls you have neglected. In that great day you will be self-convicted and\nself-condemned. May the Lord lead you now to repentance. May He forgive\nHis people for neglecting the work in His vineyard which He has given them\nto do.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:425, 426.\nWhat can we say to the slothful church member to make him realize the\nnecessity of unearthing his talent and putting\n90\nit out to the exchangers? There will be no idler, no slothful one, found inside\nthe kingdom of heaven. O that God would set this matter in all its importance\nbefore the sleeping churches! O that Zion would arise and put on her beautiful\ngarments! O that she would shine!\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:434.\nThere is work to be done for those who know not the truth, just such work\nas was done for you when you were in darkness. It is too late to sleep, too late\nto become indolent do-nothings. To every one the Householder has given a\nwork. Let us go forward, and not backward. We want a new conversion daily.\nWe want the love of Jesus throbbing in our hearts, that we may be instrumental\nin saving many souls.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nThe Lord Jesus requires that every soul who claims to be a son or daughter\nof God, should not only depart from all iniquity, but be abundant in acts of\ncharity, self-denial, and humility. The Lord has presented the working of a\ncertain law of mind and action, that should warn us in regard to our work.\nHe says: \u201cWhosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he\nseemeth to have.\u201d Those who do not improve upon their opportunities, who\ndo not exercise the grace that God gives them, have less inclination to do so,\nand \ufb01nally in a sleepy lethargy, lose that which they once possessed. They\nmake no provision for the future time of need in gaining a large experience,\nin obtaining an increased knowledge of divine things, so that when trial and\ntemptation come upon them, they may be able to stand. When persecution or\ntemptation comes, this class lose their courage and faith, and their foundation\nis swept away, because they did not see the need of making their foundation\nsure. They did not rivet their souls to the eternal Rock.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, March 27, 1894.\nHow terrible it will be in the last great day to \ufb01nd that those with whom\nwe have been familiarly associated are separated from us forever; to see the\nmembers of our families, perhaps our own children, unsaved; to \ufb01nd those\nwho have visited our homes, and eaten at our tables, among the lost. Then we\nshall ask ourselves the question, Was it\n91\nbecause of my impatience, my un-Christlike disposition; was it because self\nwas not under control, that the religion of Christ became distasteful to them?\nThe world must be warned of the soon coming of the Lord. We have but\na little time in which to work. Years have passed into eternity that might have\nbeen improved in seeking \ufb01rst the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and\nin diffusing the light to others. God now calls upon His people who have great\nlight and are established in the truth, having had much labor bestowed upon\nthem, to work for themselves and for others as they have never done before.\nMake use of every ability; bring into exercise every power, every intrusted\ntalent; use all the light that God has given you to do others good. Do not try to\nbecome preachers, but become ministers for God.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nJune 20, 1905.\nForceful Illustrations\nDivine love has been stirred to its unfathomable depths for the sake of men,\nand angels marvel to behold in the recipients of so great love a mere surface\ngratitude. Angels marvel at man\u2019s shallow appreciation of the love of God.\nHeaven stands indignant at the neglect shown to the souls of men. Would we\nknow how Christ regards it? How would a father and mother feel, did they\nknow that their child, lost in the cold and the snow, had been passed by, and\nleft to perish, by those who might have saved it? Would they not be terribly\ngrieved, wildly indignant? Would they not denounce those murderers with\nwrath hot as their tears, intense as their love? The sufferings of every man\nare the sufferings of God\u2019s child, and those who reach out no helping hand\nto their perishing fellow beings provoke His righteous anger.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 825.\nI have read of a man who, journeying on a winter\u2019s day through the deep,\ndrifted snow, became benumbed by the cold which was almost imperceptibly\nstealing away his vital powers. And as he was nearly chilled to death by the\nembrace of the frost king, and about to give up the struggle for life, he heard\nthe moans of a brother traveler, who was perishing with cold as he was about\nto perish. His\n92\nhumility was aroused to rescue him. He chafed the ice-clad limbs of the\nunfortunate man, and, after considerable effort, raised him to his feet; and as\nhe could not stand, he bore him in sympathizing arms through the very drifts\nhe had thought he could never succeed in getting through alone. And when\nhe had borne his fellow traveler to a place of safety, the truth \ufb02ashed home\nto him that in saving his neighbor he had saved himself also. His earnest\nefforts to save another quickened the blood which was freezing in his own\nveins, and created a healthful warmth in the extremities of the body. These\nlessons must be forced upon young believers continually, not only be precept,\nbut by example, that in their Christian experience they may realize similar\nresults.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:319, 320.\nYou are not to shut yourselves up to yourselves, and be content because\nyou have been blessed with a knowledge of the truth. Who brought the truth\nto you? Who showed the light of the Word of God to you? God has not\ngiven you His light to be placed under a bushel. I have read of an expedition\nthat was sent out in search of Sir John Franklin. Brave men left their homes,\nand wandered about in the North Seas, suffering privation, hunger, cold, and\ndistress. And what was it all for?\u2014Merely for the honor of discovering the\ndead bodies of the explorers, or, if possible, to rescue some of the party from\nthe terrible death that must surely come upon them, unless help should reach\nthem in time. If they could but save one man from perishing, they would count\ntheir suffering well paid for. This was done at the sacri\ufb01ce of all their comfort\nand happiness.\nThink of this, and then consider how little we are willing to sacri\ufb01ce for\nthe salvation of the precious souls around us. We are not compelled to go away\nfrom home, on a long and tedious journey, to save the life of a perishing mortal.\nAt our very doors, all about us, on every side, there are souls to be saved, souls\nperishing,\u2014men and women dying without hope, without God,\u2014and yet we\nfeel unconcerned, virtually saying by our actions, if not by our words, \u201cAm I\nmy brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d These men who lost their lives in trying to save others\nare eulogized by the world as\n93\nheroes and martyrs. How should we who have the prospect of eternal life\nbefore us feel, if we do not make the little sacri\ufb01ces that God requires of us,\nfor the salvation of the souls of men?\u2014 The Review and Herald , August 14,\n1888.\nIn a town in New England a well was being dug. When the work was\nnearly \ufb01nished, while one man was still at the bottom, the earth caved in\nand buried him. Instantly the alarm was sent out, and mechanics, farmers,\nmerchants, lawyers, hurried breathlessly to the rescue. Ropes, ladders, spades,\nand shovels were brought by eager, willing hands. \u201cSave him, O save him!\u201d\nwas the cry.\nMen worked with desperate energy, till the sweat stood in beads upon their\nbrows and their arms trembled with the exertion. At length a pipe was thrust\ndown, through which they shouted to the man to answer if he were still alive.\nThe response came, \u201cAlive, but make haste. It is fearful in here.\u201d With a shout\nof joy they renewed their efforts, and at last he was reached and saved, and the\ncheer that went up seemed to pierce the very heavens. \u201cHe is saved!\u201d echoed\nthrough every street in the town.\nWas this too great zeal and interest, too great enthusiasm, to save one man?\nIt surely was not; but what is the loss of temporal life in comparison with the\nloss of a soul? If the threatened loss of a life will arouse in human hearts a\nfeeling so intense, should not the loss of a soul arouse even deeper solicitude\nin men who claim to realize the danger of those apart from Christ? Shall not\nthe servants of God show as great zeal in laboring for the salvation of souls as\nwas shown for the life of that one man buried in a well?\u2014Gospel Workers, 31,\n32.\nProfession vs. Expression\nEvery important truth received into the heart must \ufb01nd expression in the\nlife. It is in proportion to the reception of the love of Christ that men desire to\nproclaim its power to others; and the very act of proclaiming it, deepens and\nintensi\ufb01es its value to their own souls.\u2014 The Review and Herald, February 19,\n1889.\n94\nOur faith should be proli\ufb01c of good works; for faith without works is\ndead.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:145.\nAll who receive the gospel message into the heart will long to proclaim\nit.

We must have the oil of the grace of Christ that\nwill feed the lamp, and cause the light of life to shine forth, showing the way\nto those who are in darkness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:155.\nYour spiritual strength and blessing will be proportionate to the labor of\nlove and the good works which you perform.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n3:526.\nVery much more might be done for Christ if all who have the light of truth\nwould practice the truth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:40.\nI was shown that as a people we are de\ufb01cient. Our works are not in\naccordance with our faith. Our faith testi\ufb01es that we are living under the\nproclamation of the most solemn and important message that was ever given\nto mortals. Yet in full view of this fact, our efforts, our zeal, our spirit of\nself-sacri\ufb01ce, do not compare with the character of the work. We should awake\nfrom the dead, and Christ will give us life.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:114.\nGo forth in faith, and proclaim the truth as if you believed it. Let those for\nwhom you labor see that to you it is indeed a living reality.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:42.\nA Christlike life is the most powerful argument that can be advanced in\nfavor of Christianity.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:21.\nThere are many who profess the name of Christ whose hearts are not\nengaged in His service. They have simply arrayed themselves in a profession\nof godliness, and by this very act they have made greater their condemnation,\nand have become more deceptive and more successful agents of Satan in the\nruin of souls.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 27, 1888.\n95\nThose who are watching for the Lord, are purifying their souls by\nobedience to the truth. With vigilant watching they combine earnest working.\nBecause they know that the Lord is at the door, their zeal is quickened to\nco-operate with the divine intelligences in working for the salvation of souls.\nThese are the faithful and wise servants who give to the Lord\u2019s household\n\u201ctheir portion of meat in due season.\u201d They are declaring the truth that is now\nspecially applicable. As Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and Moses each declared the\ntruth for his time, so will Christ\u2019s servants now give the special warning for\ntheir generation.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 634.\nOur standing before God depends, not upon the amount of light we\nhave received, but upon the use we make of what we have. Thus even the\nheathen who choose the right as far as they can distinguish it, are in a more\nfavorable condition than are those who have had great light, and profess to\nserve God, but who disregard the light, and by their daily life contradict their\nprofession.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 239.\nIt is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to hasten the\ncoming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess His name bearing fruit\nto His glory, how quickly the whole world would be sown with the seed of\nthe gospel. Quickly the last great harvest would be ripened, and Christ would\ncome to gather the precious grain.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 69.\nChristians should arouse themselves, and take up their neglected duties;\nfor the salvation of their own souls depends upon their individual efforts.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, August 23, 1881.\nTrue worship consists in working together with Christ. Prayers,\nexhortation, and talk are cheap fruits, which are frequently tied on; but fruits\nthat are manifested in good works, in caring for the needy, the fatherless, and\nwidows, are genuine fruits, and grow naturally upon a good tree.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, August 16, 1881.\nLet the individual members of the church take up their appointed work of\ndiffusing as well as receiving light.\n96\nNot one is excusable in being an idler in the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, February 19, 1889.\nThe doing principle is the fruit that Christ requires us to bear; doing deeds\nof benevolence, speaking kind words, and manifesting tender regard for the\npoor, the needy, the af\ufb02icted.\u2014 The Review and Herald, August 16, 1881.\nThe Samaritan woman who talked with Jesus at Jacob\u2019s well had no sooner\nfound the Saviour than she brought others to Him. She proved herself a more\neffective missionary than His own disciples. The disciples saw nothing in\nSamaria to indicate that it was an encouraging \ufb01eld. Their thoughts were\n\ufb01xed upon a great work to be done in the future. They did not see that right\naround them was a harvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they\ndespised a whole city full were brought to hear Jesus. She carried the light\nat once to her countrymen. This woman represents the working of a practical\nfaith in Christ.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 102.\nSeventh-day Adventists are making progress, doubling their numbers,\nestablishing missions, and unfurling the banner of truth in the dark places\nof the earth; and yet the work moves far more slowly than God would have it.\n[Why?] The members of the church are not individually aroused to put forth\nthe earnest effort they are capable of making, and every branch of the work\nis crippled by the lack of fervent piety, and devoted, humble, God-fearing\nlaborers. Where are the soldiers of the cross of Christ? Let the God-fearing,\nthe honest, the single-hearted, who look steadfastly to the glory of God,\nprepare themselves for the battle against error. There are too many faint,\ncowardly hearts in this hour of spiritual con\ufb02ict. O that out of weakness they\nmay be made strong, and wax valiant in \ufb01ght, and put to \ufb02ight the armies of\nthe aliens!\u2014 Historical Sketches, 290.\nIt is a universal principle that whenever one refuses to use his God-given\npowers, these powers decay and perish. Truth that is not lived, that is not\nimparted, loses its life-giving power, its healing virtue.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 206.\n97\nNothing will give bone and sinew to your piety like working to advance the\ncause you profess to love, instead of binding it.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n4:236.\nThose who endeavor to maintain Christian life by passively accepting the\nblessings that come through the means of grace, and doing nothing for Christ,\nare simply trying to live by eating without working. And in the spiritual as\nin the natural world, this always results in degeneration and decay.\u2014 Steps to\nChrist, 80, 81.\nDanger Accompanying Missionary Activity\nLet us not forget that as activity increases, and we become successful in\ndoing the work that must be accomplished, there is danger of our trusting in\nhuman plans and methods. There will be a tendency to pray less, and to have\nless faith. We shall be in danger of losing our sense of dependence upon God,\nwho alone can make our work succeed; but although this is the tendency, let\nno one think that the human instrument is to do less. No, he is not to do less,\nbut to do more by accepting the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, July 4, 1893.\nThere will come times when the church will be stirred by divine power,\nand earnest activity will be the result; for the life-giving power of the Holy\nSpirit will inspire its members to go forth and bring souls to Christ. But when\nthis activity is manifested, the most earnest workers will be safe only as they\ndepend upon God through constant, earnest prayer. They will need to make\nearnest supplication that through the grace of Christ they may be saved from\ntaking pride in their work, or of making a savior of their activity. They must\nconstantly look to Jesus, that they may realize that it is His power which does\nthe work, and thus be able to ascribe all the glory to God. We shall be called\nupon to make most decided efforts to extend the work of God, and prayer to\nour heavenly Father will be most essential. It will be necessary to engage in\nprayer in the closet, in the family, and in the church.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJuly 4, 1893.\nIn the estimation of the rabbis, it was the sum of religion to be always in a\nbustle of activity. They depended upon\n98\nsome outward performance to show their superior piety. Thus they separated\ntheir souls from God, and built themselves up in self-suf\ufb01ciency. The same\ndangers still exist. As activity increases, and men become successful in doing\nany work for God, there is danger of trusting to human plans and methods.\nThere is a tendency to pray less, and to have less faith. Like the disciples, we\nare in danger of losing sight of our dependence on God, and seeking to make\na savior of our activity. We need to look constantly to Jesus, realizing that it\nis His power which does the work. While we are to labor earnestly for the\nsalvation of the lost, we must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and\nfor the study of the Word of God. Only the work accomplished with much\nprayer, and sancti\ufb01ed by the merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been\nef\ufb01cient for good.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 362.\nEncouragement to Beginners in Christian Service\nThe most successful toilers are those who cheerfully take up the work of\nserving God in little things. Every human being is to work with his life-thread,\nweaving it into the fabric to help complete the pattern.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:115.\nWe are to make our everyday duties acts of devotion, constantly increasing\nin usefulness, because we see our work in the light of eternity.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:150.\nThe Lord has a place for every one in His great plan. Talents that are not\nneeded are not bestowed.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:37.\nEach has his place in the eternal plan of heaven. Each is to work in\nco-operation with Christ for the salvation of souls. Not more surely is the place\nprepared for us in the heavenly mansions than is the special place designated\non earth where we are to work for God.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 326, 327.\nThe Lord has His eye upon every one of His people; He has His plans\nconcerning each.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:12.\n99\nAll can do something in the work. None will be pronounced guiltless\nbefore God unless they have worked earnestly and unsel\ufb01shly for the salvation\nof souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:395.\nYour duty cannot be shifted upon another. No one but yourself can do your\nwork. If you withhold your light, someone must be left in darkness through\nyour neglect.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:464.\nThe humble worker who obediently responds to the call of God may be\nsure of receiving divine assistance. To accept so great and holy a responsibility\nis itself elevating to the character. It calls into action the highest mental and\nspiritual powers, and strengthens and puri\ufb01es the mind and heart. Through\nfaith in the power of God, it is wonderful how strong a weak man may\nbecome, how decided his efforts, how proli\ufb01c of great results. He who begins\nwith a little knowledge, in a humble way, and tells what he knows, while\nseeking diligently for further knowledge, will \ufb01nd the whole heavenly treasure\nawaiting his demand. The more he seeks to impart light, the more light he\nwill receive. The more one tries to explain the Word of God to others, with\na love for souls, the plainer it becomes to himself. The more we use our\nknowledge and exercise our powers, the more knowledge and power we shall\nhave.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 354.\nLet every one labor for God and for souls; let each show wisdom, and\nnever be found in idleness, waiting for some one to set him to work. The\n\u201csome one\u201d who could set you to work is overcrowded with responsibilities,\nand time is lost in waiting for his directions. God will give you wisdom\nin reforming at once; for the call is still made, \u201cSon, go work today in My\nvineyard.\u201d \u201cToday if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts.\u201d Hebrews\n3:7, 8. The Lord prefaces the requirement with the endearing word \u201cson.\u201d\nHow tender, how compassionate, yet withal, how urgent!

The joy of the Lord is an element of strength.\nIf you are faithful, the peace that passeth all understanding will be your\nreward in this life, and in the future life you will enter into the joy of your\nLord.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:34.\nPersons of little talent, if faithful in keeping their hearts in the love of God,\nmay win many souls to Christ. Harlan Page was a poor mechanic of ordinary\nability and limited education; but he made it his chief business to seek to\nadvance the cause of God, and his efforts were crowned with marked success.\nHe labored for the salvation of his\n101\nfellow men in private conversation and in earnest prayer. He established prayer\nmeetings, organized Sunday schools, and distributed tracts and other religious\nreading. And on his deathbed, with the shadow of eternity resting upon his\ncountenance, he was able to say, \u201cI know that it is all of God\u2019s grace, and not\nthrough any merit of anything that I have done; but I think I have evidence that\nmore than one hundred souls have been converted to God through my personal\ninstrumentality.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:307, 308.\nThis world is not the Christian\u2019s heaven, but merely the workshop of\nGod, where we are to be \ufb01tted up to unite with sinless angels in a holy\nheaven.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:187.\nThe humblest and poorest of the disciples of Jesus can be a blessing to\nothers. They may not realize that they are doing any special good, but by their\nunconscious in\ufb02uence they may start waves of blessing that will widen and\ndeepen, and the blessed results they may never know until the day of \ufb01nal\nreward. They do not feel or know that they are doing anything great. They are\nnot required to weary themselves with anxiety about success. They have only\nto go forward quietly, doing faithfully the work that God\u2019s providence assigns,\nand their life will not be in vain. Their own souls will be growing more and\nmore into the likeness of Christ; they are workers together with God in this\nlife, and are thus \ufb01tting for the higher work and the unshadowed joy of the life\nto come.\u2014 Steps to Christ, 83.\nThere are many who have given themselves to Christ, yet who see no\nopportunity of doing a large work or making great sacri\ufb01ces in His service.\nThese may \ufb01nd comfort in the thought that it is not necessarily the martyr\u2019s\nself-surrender which is most acceptable to God; it may not be the missionary\nwho has daily faced danger and death, that stands highest in heaven\u2019s records.\nThe Christian who is such in his private life, in the daily surrender of self, in\nsincerity of purpose and purity of thought, in meekness under provocation, in\nfaith and piety, in \ufb01delity in that which is least, the one who in the home life\nrepresents the character of Christ,\u2014such a one may in the sight of God be\nmore precious than\n102\neven the world-renowned missionary or martyr.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons ,\n403.\nNot the amount of labor performed, or its visible results, but the spirit in\nwhich the work is done, makes it of value with God.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n397.\nThe approval of the Master is not given because of the greatness of the\nwork performed, because many things have been gained, but because of the\n\ufb01delity in even a few things. It is not the great results we attain, but the\nmotives from which we act, that weigh with God. He prizes goodness and\nfaithfulness more than the greatness of the work accomplished.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 2:510, 511.\nDo not pass by the little things, and look for a large work. You might do\nsuccessfully the small work, but fail utterly in attempting a large work, and\nfall into discouragement. Take hold wherever you see that there is work to be\ndone. Whether you are rich or poor, great or humble, God calls you into active\nservice for Him. It will be by doing with your might what your hands \ufb01nd to do\nthat you will develop talent and aptitude for the work. And it is by neglecting\nyour daily opportunities that you become fruitless and withered. This is why\nthere are so many fruitless trees in the garden of the Lord.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:129.\nThe Lord desires us to use every gift we have; and if we do this, we\nshall have greater gifts to use. He does not supernaturally endow us with the\nquali\ufb01cations we lack; but while we use that which we have, He will work with\nus to increase and strengthen every faculty. By every wholehearted, earnest\nsacri\ufb01ce for the Master\u2019s service, our powers will increase.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 353, 354.\nChrist\u2019s heart is cheered by the sight of those who are poor in every sense\nof the term; cheered by His view of the ill-used ones who are meek; cheered\nby the seemingly unsatis\ufb01ed hungering after righteousness, by the inability\nof many to begin. He welcomes, as it were, the very condition of things that\nwould discourage many ministers.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 37.\nWe need not go to heathen lands, or even leave the narrow circle of the\nhome, if it is there that our duty lies, in order to work for Christ. We can do\nthis in the home\n103\ncircle, in the church, among those with whom we associate, and with whom\nwe do business.\u2014 Steps to Christ, 81.\nIf we are making the life and teachings of Christ our study, every passing\nevent will furnish a text for an impressive discourse.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:63.\nThe life on earth is the beginning of the life in heaven; education on earth\nis an initiation into the principles of heaven; the life-work here is a training\nfor the life-work there. What we now are, in character and holy service, is the\nsure foreshadowing of what we shall be.\u2014 Education, 307.\nThose who reject the privilege of fellowship with Christ in service, reject\nthe only training that imparts a \ufb01tness for participation with Him in His\nglory. They reject the training that in this life gives strength and nobility of\ncharacter.\u2014 Education, 264.\nLet none suppose that they can live a life of sel\ufb01shness, and then, having\nserved their own interests, enter into the joy of their Lord. In the joy of\nunsel\ufb01sh love they could not participate. They would not be \ufb01tted for the\nheavenly courts. They could not appreciate the pure atmosphere of love\nthat pervades heaven. The voices of the angels and the music of their harps\nwould not satisfy them. To their minds the science of heaven would be as an\nenigma.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 364, 365.\nChrist calls upon us to labor patiently and perseveringly for the thousands\nperishing in their sins, scattered in all lands, like wrecks on a desert shore.\nThose who share in Christ\u2019s glory must share also in His ministry, helping the\nweak, the wretched, and the despondent.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:31.\nThe common people are to take their place as workers. Sharing the sorrows\nof their fellow men as the Saviour shared the sorrows of humanity, they will\nby faith see Him working with them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:272.\nChrist is sitting for His portrait in every disciple. Every one God has\npredestinated to be \u201cconformed to the image of His Son.\u201d In every one\nChrist\u2019s long-suffering love, His holiness, meekness, mercy, and truth, are\nto be manifested to the world.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 827.\n104\nThe call to place all on the altar of service comes to each one. We are not\nall asked to serve as Elisha served, nor are we all bidden to sell everything we\nhave; but God asks us to give His service the \ufb01rst place in our lives, to allow no\nday to pass without doing something to advance His work in the earth. He does\nnot expect from all the same kind of service. One may be called to ministry\nin a foreign land; another may be asked to give of his means for the support\nof gospel work. God accepts the offering of each. It is the consecration of the\nlife and all its interests, that is necessary. Those who make this consecration,\nwill hear and obey the call of Heaven.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 221.\nThe worldly wise man, who meditates and plans, and whose business is\never in his mind, should seek to become wise in matters of eternal interest. If\nhe would put forth as much energy to secure the heavenly treasure and the life\nwhich measures with the life of God as he does to secure worldly gain, what\ncould he not accomplish?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:297.\nGod will move upon men in humble positions to declare the message of\npresent truth. Many such will be seen hastening hither and thither, constrained\nby the Spirit of God to give the light to those in darkness. The truth is as a\n\ufb01re in their bones, \ufb01lling them with a burning desire to enlighten those who\nsit in darkness. Many, even among the uneducated, will proclaim the word of\nthe Lord. Children will be impelled by the Holy Spirit to go forth to declare\nthe message of heaven. The Spirit will be poured out upon those who yield\nto His promptings. Casting off man\u2019s binding rules and cautious movements,\nthey will join the army of the Lord.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:26, 27.\nThe Christian Life in Landscape\nThe heart that receives the word of God is not as a pool that evaporates,\nnot like a broken cistern that loses its treasure. It is like the mountain stream,\nfed by unfailing springs, whose cool, sparkling waters leap from rock to rock,\nrefreshing the weary, the thirsty, the heavy-laden. It\n105\nis like a river constantly \ufb02owing, and as it advances, becoming deeper and\nwider, until its life-giving waters are spread over all the earth. The stream that\ngoes singing on its way, leaves behind its gift of verdure and fruitfulness. The\ngrass on its banks is a fresher green, the trees have a richer verdure, the \ufb02owers\nare more abundant. When the earth lies bare and brown under the summer\u2019s\nscorching heat, a line of verdure marks the river\u2019s course.\nSo it is with the true child of God. The religion of Christ reveals itself as\na vitalizing, pervading principle, a living, working, spiritual energy. When the\nheart is opened to the heavenly in\ufb02uence of truth and love, these principles\nwill \ufb02ow forth again like streams in the desert, causing fruitfulness to appear\nwhere now are barrenness and dearth.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 233, 234.\nThe Christian\u2019s Watchwords\nThere are three watchwords in the Christian life, which must be heeded\nif we would not have Satan steal a march upon us; namely, Watch, Pray,\nWork.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:283.\nEvery soul that has made a profession of Christ has pledged himself to be\nall that it is possible for him to be as a spiritual worker, to be active, zealous,\nand ef\ufb01cient in his Master\u2019s service. Christ expects every man to do his duty;\nlet this be the watchword throughout the ranks of His followers.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:460.\nA Spiritual Paralytic\nStrength comes by exercise. All who put to use the ability which God has\ngiven them, will have increased ability to devote to His service. Those who do\nnothing in the cause of God, will fail to grow in grace and in the knowledge of\nthe truth. A man who would lie down and refuse to exercise his limbs, would\nsoon lose all power to use them. Thus the Christian who will not exercise\nhis God-given powers, not only fails to grow up into Christ, but he loses the\nstrength which he already had; he becomes a spiritual paralytic. It is those\nwho, with love for God and their fellow men, are striving to help others, that\nbecome established, strengthened, settled, in the truth. The true Christian\n106\nworks for God, not from impulse, but from principle; not for a day or a month,\nbut during the entire period of life.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:393.\nThe Sure Remedy\nFor the disheartened there is a sure remedy,\u2014faith, prayer, work. Faith\nand activity will impart assurance and satisfaction that will increase day by\nday. Are you tempted to give way to feelings of anxious foreboding or utter\ndespondency? In the darkest days, when appearances seem most forbidding,\nfear not. Have faith in God. He knows your need. He has all power. His\nin\ufb01nite love and compassion never weary. Fear not that He will fail of ful\ufb01lling\nHis promise. He is eternal truth. Never will He change the covenant He has\nmade with those who love Him. And He will bestow upon His faithful servants\nthe measure of ef\ufb01ciency that their need demands.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 164,\n165.\nThere is but one genuine cure for spiritual laziness, and that is\nwork,\u2014working for souls who need your help.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n4:236.\nThis is the recipe that Christ has prescribed for the fainthearted, doubting,\ntrembling soul. Let the sorrowful ones, who walk mournfully before the Lord,\narise and help some one who needs help.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:266.\nChristians who are constantly growing in earnestness, in zeal, in fervor,\nin love,\u2014such Christians never backslide.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 7,\n1887.\nIt is those who are not engaged in this unsel\ufb01sh labor who have a sickly\nexperience, and become worn out with struggling, doubting, murmuring,\nsinning, and repenting, until they lose all sense as to what constitutes genuine\nreligion. They feel that they cannot go back to the world, and so they hang\non the skirts of Zion, having petty jealousies, envyings, disappointments, and\nremorse. They are full of fault \ufb01nding, and feed upon the mistakes and errors\nof their brethren. They have only a hopeless, faithless, sunless experience in\ntheir religious life.\u2014 The Review and Herald, September 2, 1890.\n107\nUnwarranted Excuses\nWhen Jesus went away, He left to every man his work, and \u201cnothing to\ndo\u201d is an unwarrantable excuse. \u201cNothing to do\u201d is the reason of trial among\nthe brethren; for Satan will \ufb01ll the minds of idlers with his own plans, and set\nthem to work.... \u201cNothing to do\u201d brings evil testimony against the brethren,\nand dissension into the church of Christ. Jesus says, \u201cHe that gathereth not\nwith Me scattereth abroad.\u201d\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nBrethren and sisters, many of you excuse yourselves from labor, on the\nplea of inability to work for others. But did God make you so incapable? Was\nnot this inability produced by your own inactivity, and perpetuated by your\nown deliberate choice? Did not God give you at least one talent to improve, not\nfor your own convenience and grati\ufb01cation, but for Him? Have you realized\nyour obligation, as His hired servant, to bring a revenue to Him by the wise\nand skillful use of this intrusted capital? Have you not neglected opportunities\nto improve your powers to this end? It is too true that few have felt any real\nsense of their responsibility to God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:457.\nMany have the idea that if their life is a working, business life, they can\ndo nothing for the salvation of souls, nothing to advance the cause of their\nRedeemer. They say they cannot do things by the halves, and therefore turn\nfrom religious duties and religious exercises, and bury themselves up in the\nworld. They make their business primary, and forget God, and He is displeased\nwith them. If any are engaged in business where they cannot advance in the\ndivine life and perfect holiness in the fear of God, they should change to a\nbusiness in which they can have Jesus with them every hour.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 2:233, 234.\nAim for a Heavy Crown\nWe must not become weary or faint-hearted. It would be a terrible loss\nto barter away enduring glory for ease, convenience, and enjoyment, or for\ncarnal indulgences. A gift from the hand of God awaits the overcomer. Not\none of us deserves it; it is gratuitous on His part. Wonderful\n108\nand glorious will be this gift, but let us remember that \u201cone star differeth from\nanother star in glory.\u201d But as we are urged to strive for the mastery, let us aim,\nin the strength of Jesus, for the crown heavy with stars. \u201cThey that be wise\nshall shine as the \ufb01rmament, and they that win many to righteousness as the\nstars forever and ever.\u201d\u2014 The Review and Herald, October 25, 1881.\nService Has Been Paid For\nThe Lord at His coming will scrutinize every talent; He will demand\ninterest on the capital He has intrusted. By His own humiliation and agony,\nby His life of toil and His death of shame, Christ has paid for the service of\nall who have taken His name and profess to be His servants.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:104.\nAll are under deepest obligation to improve every capability for the work\nof winning souls to Him. \u201cYe are not your own,\u201d He says; \u201cfor ye are bought\nwith a price;\u201d therefore glorify God by a life of service that will win men\nand women from sin to righteousness. We are bought with the price of\nChrist\u2019s own life,\u2014bought that we may return to God His own in faithful\nservice.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:104.\nGod has given me a message for His people. They must awake, spread\ntheir tents, and enlarge their borders. My brethren and sisters, you have been\nbought with a price, and all that you have and are is to be used to the glory\nof God and for the good of your fellow men. Christ died on the cross to\nsave the world from perishing in sin. He asks your co-operation in this work.\nYou are to be His helping hand. With earnest, unwearying effort you are to\nseek to save the lost. Remember that it was your sins that made the cross\nnecessary.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:9.\nChrist\u2019s followers have been redeemed for service. Our Lord teaches that\nthe true object of life is ministry. Christ Himself was a worker, and to all\nHis followers He gives the law of service,\u2014service to God and to their fellow\nmen.... The law of service becomes the connecting link which binds us to God\nand to our fellow men.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 326.\n109\nGo Forward\nOften the Christian life is beset with dangers, and duty seems hard to\nperform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage and\ndeath behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, Go forward. Let us\nobey the command, even though our sight cannot penetrate the darkness.\nThe obstacles that hinder our progress will never disappear before a halting,\ndoubting spirit. Those who defer obedience till every uncertainty disappears,\nand there remains no risk of failure or defeat, will never obey. Faith looks\nbeyond the dif\ufb01culties, and lays hold of the unseen, even Omnipotence,\ntherefore it cannot be baf\ufb02ed. Faith is the clasping of the hand of Christ in\nevery emergency.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 262.\nOur ideas are altogether too narrow. God calls for continual advancement\nin the work of diffusing light. We must study improved ways and means of\nreaching the people. We need to hear with ears of faith the mighty Captain of\nthe Lord\u2019s host saying, \u201cGo forward.\u201d We must act, and God will not fail us.\nHe will do His part when we in faith do ours. Brethren and sisters who have\nbeen long in the truth, you have not done the work God calls upon you to do.\nWhere is your love for souls?\u2014 Historical Sketches, 289, 290.\nIt was the joy of Christ to save souls. Let this be your work and your joy.\nPerform all duties and make all sacri\ufb01ces for Christ\u2019s sake, and He will be\nyour constant helper. Go straight forward where the voice of duty calls; let no\nseeming dif\ufb01culties hinder you. Take up your God-given responsibilities, and\nas you bear your sometimes heavy burdens, do not ask, \u201cWhy idle stands my\nbrother, no yoke upon him laid?\u201d Do the duty nearest you, and do it thoroughly\nand well, not coveting praise, but working for the Master because you belong\nto Him.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 2, 1903.\nThe course of God\u2019s people should be upward and onward to victory. A\ngreater than Joshua is leading on the armies of Israel. One is in our midst,\neven the Captain of our salvation, who has said for our encouragement, \u201cLo, I\nam with you always, even unto the end of the world.\u201d\n110\n\u201cBe of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d He will lead us on to certain\nvictory. What God promises, He is able at any time to perform. And the work\nHe gives His people to do, He is able to accomplish by them.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 2:122.\nWhy do we not become enthused with the Spirit of Christ? Why are we\nso little moved by the pitiful cries of a suffering world? Do we consider our\nexalted privilege of adding a star to Christ\u2019s crown\u2014a soul cut loose from\nthe chains with which Satan has bound him, a soul saved in the kingdom of\nGod? The church must realize its obligation to carry the gospel of present\ntruth to every creature. I entreat of you to read the third and fourth chapters\nof Zechariah. If these chapters are understood, if they are received, a work\nwill be done for those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness, a\nwork that means to the church, \u201cGo forward and upward.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 6:296.\nThe great majority of this earth\u2019s inhabitants have given their allegiance to\nthe enemy. But we have not been deceived. Notwithstanding the apparent\ntriumph of Satan, Christ is carrying forward His work in the heavenly\nsanctuary and on the earth. The Word of God portrays the wickedness\nand corruption that would exist in the last days. As we see the ful\ufb01llment\nof prophecy, our faith in the \ufb01nal triumph of Christ\u2019s kingdom should\nstrengthen; and we should go forth with renewed courage to do our appointed\nwork.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 26, 27.\nAn Impressive Scene\nIn the visions of the night a very impressive scene passed before me. I saw\nan immense ball of \ufb01re fall among some beautiful mansions, causing their\ninstant destruction. I heard some one say, \u201cWe knew that the judgments of\nGod were coming upon the earth, but we did not know that they would come\nso soon.\u201d Others, with agonized voices, said, \u201cYou knew! Why then did you\nnot tell us? We did not know!\u201d On every side I heard similar words of reproach\nspoken.\nIn great distress I awoke. I went to sleep again, and I seemed to be in a\nlarge gathering. One of authority\n111\nwas addressing the company, before whom was spread out a map of the world.\nHe said that the map pictured God\u2019s vineyard, which must be cultivated. As\nlight from heaven shone upon any one, that one was to re\ufb02ect the light to\nothers. Lights were to be kindled in many places, and from these lights still\nother lights were to be kindled.\nThe words were repeated: \u201cYe are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have\nlost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing,\nbut to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the\nworld. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle,\nand put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that\nare in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your\ngood works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:13-16.\nI saw jets of light shining from cities and villages, and from the high places\nand the low places of the earth. God\u2019s word was obeyed, and as a result there\nwere memorials for Him in every city and village. His truth was proclaimed\nthroughout the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:28, 29.\n112\nChap. 10 - Methods\nHouse to House\nOf equal importance with special public efforts is house-to-house work\nin the homes of the people. In large cities there are certain classes that\ncannot be reached by public meetings. These must be searched out as the\nshepherd searches for his lost sheep. Diligent, personal effort must be put\nforth in their behalf. When personal work is neglected, many precious\nopportunities are lost, which, were they improved, would advance the work\ndecidedly.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:111.\nDeeds as well as words of sympathy are needed. Christ prefaced the\ngiving of His message by deeds of love and benevolence. Let these workers\ngo from house to house, helping where help is needed, and, as opportunity\noffers, telling the story of the cross. Christ is to be their text. They need\nnot dwell upon doctrinal subjects; let them speak of the work and sacri\ufb01ce\nof Christ. Let them hold up His righteousness, in their lives revealing His\npurity.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:228.\nGod is no respecter of persons. He will use humble, devoted Christians,\neven if they have not received so thorough an education as some others. Let\nsuch ones engage in service for Him by doing house-to-house work. Sitting\nby the \ufb01reside, they can\u2014if humble, discreet, and godly\u2014do more to meet\nthe real needs of families than could an ordained minister.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 7:21.\nAmong the members of our churches there should be more house-to-house\nlabor, in giving Bible readings and distributing literature.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:127.\nThose who engage in house-to-house labor will \ufb01nd opportunities for\nministry in many lines. They should pray for the sick, and should do all in their\npower to relieve them from suffering. They should work among the lowly, the\npoor, and the oppressed. We should pray for and with the helpless ones who\nhave not strength of will to control the\n113\nappetites that passion has degraded. Earnest, persevering effort must be made\nfor the salvation of those in whose hearts an interest is awakened. Many can\nbe reached only through acts of disinterested kindness. Their physical wants\nmust \ufb01rst be relieved. As they see evidence of our unsel\ufb01sh love, it will be\neasier for them to believe in the love of Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:83, 84.\nLet the workers go from house to house, opening the Bible to the people,\ncirculating the publications, telling others of the light that has blessed their\nown souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:123.\nOur Saviour went from house to house, healing the sick, comforting the\nmourners, soothing the af\ufb02icted, speaking peace to the disconsolate. He took\nthe little children in His arms and blessed them, and spoke words of hope and\ncomfort to the weary mothers. With unfailing tenderness and gentleness, He\nmet every form of human woe and af\ufb02iction. Not for Himself, but for others\ndid He labor. He was the servant of all. It was His meat and drink to bring\nhope and strength to all with whom He came in contact.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n188.\nThe presentation of the truth, in love and simplicity, from house to house,\nis in harmony with the instruction that Christ gave His disciples when He\nsent them out on their \ufb01rst missionary tour. By songs of praise, by humble,\nheartfelt prayers, many will be reached. The divine Worker will be present to\nsend conviction to hearts. \u201cI am with you always,\u201d is His promise. With the\nassurance of the abiding presence of such a helper, we may labor with faith\nand hope and courage.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:34.\nHouse-to-house laborers are needed. The Lord calls for decided efforts to\nbe put forth in places where the people know nothing of Bible truth. Singing\nand prayer and Bible readings are needed in the homes of the people. Now,\njust now, is the time to obey the commission, \u201cTeaching them to observe all\nthings whatsoever I have commanded you.\u201d Those who do this work must\nhave a ready knowledge of\n114\nthe Scriptures. \u201cIt is written\u201d is to be their weapon of defense.\u2014 Counsels to\nParents, Teachers, and Students, 540.\nMy brethren and sisters, visit those who live near you, and by sympathy\nand kindness seek to reach their hearts. Be sure to work in a way that will\nremove prejudice instead of creating it. And remember that those who know\nthe truth for this time, and yet con\ufb01ne their efforts to their own churches,\nrefusing to work for their unconverted neighbors, will be called to account for\nunful\ufb01lled duties.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:34.\nOn this \ufb01rst tour the disciples were to go only where Jesus had been before\nthem, and had made friends. Their preparation for the journey was to be of the\nsimplest kind. Nothing must be allowed to divert their minds from their great\nwork, or in any way excite opposition and close the door for further labor.\nThey were not to adopt the dress of the religious teachers, nor use any guise in\napparel to distinguish them from the humble peasants. They were not to enter\ninto the synagogues and call the people together for public service; their efforts\nwere to be put forth in house-to-house labor. They were not to waste time in\nneedless salutations, or in going from house to house for entertainment. But\nin every place they were to accept the hospitality of those who were worthy,\nthose who would welcome them heartily as if entertaining Christ Himself.\nThey were to enter the dwelling with the beautiful salutation, \u201cPeace be to this\nhouse.\u201d That home would be blessed by their prayers, their songs of praise,\nand the opening of the Scriptures in the family circle.\u2014 The Desire of Ages ,\n351, 352.\nVisit your neighbors in a friendly way, and become acquainted with\nthem.... Those who do not take up this work, those who act with the\nindifference that some have manifested, will soon lose their \ufb01rst love, and will\nbegin to censure, criticize, and condemn their own brethren.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, May 13, 1902.\nThe apostle\u2019s efforts were not con\ufb01ned to public speaking; there were\nmany who could not have been reached in that way. He spent much time\nin house-to-house labor, thus availing himself of the familiar intercourse of\nthe home\n115\ncircle. He visited the sick and the sorrowing, comforted the af\ufb02icted, and lifted\nup the oppressed. And in all that he said and did, he magni\ufb01ed the name of\nJesus. Thus he labored, \u201cin weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.\u201d He\ntrembled lest his teaching should reveal the impress of the human rather than\nthe divine.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 250.\nGo to your neighbors one by one, and come close to them till their hearts\nare warmed by your unsel\ufb01sh interest and love. Sympathize with them, pray\nwith them, watch for opportunities to do them good, and as you can, gather\na few together and open the Word of God to their darkened minds. Keep\nwatching, as he who must render an account for the souls of men, and make\nthe most of the privileges that God gives you of laboring with Him in His\nmoral vineyard. Do not neglect speaking to your neighbors, and doing them\nall the kindness in your power, that you \u201cby all means may save some.\u201d We\nneed to seek for the spirit that constrained the apostle Paul to go from house\nto house pleading with tears, and teaching \u201crepentance toward God, and faith\ntoward our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nThe Lord has presented before me the work that is to be done in our cities.\nThe believers in these cities are to work for God in the neighborhood of their\nhomes. They are to labor quietly and in humility, carrying with them wherever\nthey go the atmosphere of heaven.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:128.\nThe One-Soul Audience\nThe work of Christ was largely made up of personal interviews. He had a\nfaithful regard for the one-soul audience. From that one soul the intelligence\nreceived was carried to thousands.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:115.\nHe was faint and weary; yet He did not neglect the opportunity of speaking\nto one woman, though she was a stranger, an alien from Israel, and living in\nopen sin.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 194.\nThe Saviour did not wait for congregations to assemble. Often He began\nHis lessons with only a few gathered about\n116\nHim, but one by one the passers-by paused to listen, until a multitude heard\nwith wonder and awe the words of God through the heaven-sent Teacher.\nThe worker for Christ should not feel that he cannot speak with the same\nearnestness to a few hearers as to a large company. There may be only one to\nhear the message; but who can tell how far-reaching will be its in\ufb02uence? It\nseemed a small matter, even to His disciples, for the Saviour to spend His time\nupon a woman of Samaria. But He reasoned more earnestly and eloquently\nwith her than with kings, councilors, or high priests. The lessons He gave to\nthat woman have been repeated to the earth\u2019s remotest bounds.\u2014 The Desire\nof Ages, 194.\nClose Personal Touch\nThere is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. If less time\nwere given to sermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry,\ngreater results would be seen.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 143.\nThe Lord desires that His word of grace shall be brought home to every\nsoul. To a great degree this must be accomplished by personal labor. This was\nChrist\u2019s method.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 229.\nThose who have been most successful in soul-winning were men and\nwomen who did not pride themselves on their ability, but who in humility\nand faith sought to help those about them. Jesus did this very work. He came\nclose to those whom He desired to reach.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 194.\nIn Christlike sympathy we should come close to men individually, and\nseek to awaken their interest in the great things of eternal life. Their hearts may\nbe as hard as the beaten highway, and apparently it may be a useless effort to\npresent the Saviour to them; but while logic may fail to move, and argument\nbe powerless to convince, the love of Christ, revealed in personal ministry,\nmay soften the stony heart, so that the seed of truth can take root.\u2014 Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons, 57.\nBy personal labor reach those around you. Become acquainted with them.\nPreaching will not do the work that needs to be done. Angels of God attend\nyou to the dwellings\n117\nof those you visit. This work cannot be done by proxy. Money lent or given\nwill not accomplish it. Sermons will not do it. By visiting the people, talking,\npraying, sympathizing with them, you will win hearts. This is the highest\nmissionary work that you can do. To do it, you will need resolute, persevering\nfaith, unwearying patience, and a deep love for souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:41.\nWith the calling of John and Andrew and Simon, of Philip and Nathanael,\nbegan the foundation of the Christian church. John directed two of his\ndisciples to Christ. Then one of these, Andrew, found his brother, and called\nhim to the Saviour. Philip was then called, and he went in search of Nathanael.\nThese examples should teach us the importance of personal effort, of making\ndirect appeals to our kindred, friends, and neighbors. There are those who\nfor a lifetime have professed to be acquainted with Christ, yet who have never\nmade a personal effort to bring even one soul to the Saviour. They leave all the\nwork for the minister. He may be well quali\ufb01ed for his calling, but he cannot\ndo that which God has left for the members of the church.\nThere are many who need the ministration of loving Christian hearts.\nMany have gone down to ruin who might have been saved, if their neighbors,\ncommon men and women, had put forth personal effort for them. Many are\nwaiting to be personally addressed. In the very family, the neighborhood, the\ntown where we live, there is work for us to do as missionaries for Christ. If\nwe are Christians, this work will be our delight. No sooner is one converted\nthan there is born within him a desire to make known to others what a precious\nfriend he has found in Jesus. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut\nup in his heart.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 141.\nOne of the most effective ways in which light can be communicated is by\nprivate personal effort. In the home circle, at your neighbor\u2019s \ufb01reside, at the\nbedside of the sick, in a quiet way you may read the Scriptures and speak a\nword for Jesus and the truth. Thus you may sow precious seed that will spring\nup and bring forth fruit.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:428, 429.\n118\nSalt must be mingled with the substance to which it is added; it must\npenetrate and infuse in order to preserve. So it is through personal contact\nand association that men are reached by the saving power of the gospel. They\nare not saved in masses, but as individuals. Personal in\ufb02uence is a power.\nWe must come close to those whom we desire to bene\ufb01t.\u2014 Thoughts from the\nMount of Blessing, 36.\nJesus saw in every soul one to whom must be given the call to His\nkingdom. He reached the hearts of the people by going among them as one\nwho desired their good. He sought them in the public streets, in private houses,\non the boats, in the synagogue, by the shores of the lake, and at the marriage\nfeast. He met them at their daily vocations, and manifested an interest in\ntheir secular affairs. He carried His instruction into the household, bringing\nfamilies in their own homes under the in\ufb02uence of His divine presence. His\nstrong personal sympathy helped to win hearts.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 151.\nChrist\u2019s method alone will give true success in reaching the people. The\nSaviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His\nsympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their con\ufb01dence. Then\nHe bade them, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 143.\nWe should do as Christ did. Wherever He was, in the synagogue, by the\nwayside, in the boat thrust out a little from the land, at the Pharisee\u2019s feast\nor the table of the publican, He spoke to men of the things pertaining to the\nhigher life. The things of nature, the events of daily life, were bound up by\nHim with the words of truth. The hearts of His hearers were drawn to Him; for\nHe had healed their sick, had comforted their sorrowing ones, and had taken\ntheir children in His arms and blessed them. When He opened His lips to\nspeak, their attention was riveted upon Him, and every word was to some soul\na savor of life unto life.\nSo it should be with us. Wherever we are, we should watch for\nopportunities of speaking to others of the Saviour. If we follow Christ\u2019s\nexample in doing good, hearts will open to us as they did to Him. Not abruptly,\nbut with\n119\ntact born of divine love, we can tell them of Him who is the \u201cchiefest among\nten thousand,\u201d and the One \u201caltogether lovely.\u201d This is the very highest work\nin which we can employ the talent of speech. It was given to us that we might\npresent Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 338,\n339.\nHis presence brought a purer atmosphere into the home, and His life was\nas leaven working amid the elements of society. Harmless and unde\ufb01led, He\nwalked among the thoughtless, the rude, the uncourteous; amid the unjust\npublicans, the reckless prodigals, the unrighteous Samaritans, the heathen\nsoldiers, the rough peasants, and the mixed multitude. He spoke a word of\nsympathy here and a word there, as He saw men weary, yet compelled to bear\nheavy burdens. He shared their burdens, and repeated to them the lessons He\nhad learned from nature, of the love, the kindness, the goodness of God.\nThe Combination of Spiritual Revival and Personal Work\nHe taught all to look upon themselves as endowed with precious talents,\nwhich if rightly employed would secure for them eternal riches. He weeded\nall vanity from life, and by His own example taught that every moment of\ntime is fraught with eternal results; that it is to be cherished as a treasure,\nand to be employed for holy purposes. He passed by no human being as\nworthless, but sought to apply the saving remedy to every soul. In whatever\ncompany He found Himself, He presented a lesson that was appropriate to\nthe time and the circumstances. He sought to inspire with hope the most\nrough and unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might\nbecome blameless, and harmless, attaining such a character as would make\nthem manifest as the children of God. Often He met those who had drifted\nunder Satan\u2019s control, and who had no power to break from his snare. To\nsuch a one, discouraged, sick, tempted, and fallen, Jesus would speak words\nof tenderest pity, words that were needed and could be understood. Others\nHe met who were \ufb01ghting a hand-to-hand battle with the adversary of souls.\nThese He encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they would win; for\nangels of God were on their side, and would give them the victory.\u2014 The\nDesire of Ages, 91.\n120\nThe Combination of Spiritual Revival and Personal Work\nWhen churches are revived, it is because some individual seeks earnestly\nfor the blessing of God. He hungers and thirsts after God, and asks in faith, and\nreceives accordingly. He goes to work in earnest, feeling his great dependence\nupon the Lord, and souls are aroused to seek for a like blessing, and a season of\nrefreshing falls on the hearts of men. The extensive work will not be neglected.\nThe larger plans will be laid at the right time; but personal, individual effort\nand interest for your friends and neighbors, will accomplish much more than\ncan be estimated. It is for the want of this kind of labor that souls for whom\nChrist died are perishing.\nOne soul is of in\ufb01nite value; for Calvary speaks its worth. One soul,\nwon to the truth, will be instrumental in winning others, and there will be an\never-increasing result of blessing and salvation. Your work may accomplish\nmore real good than the more extensive meetings, if they lack in personal\neffort. When both are combined, with the blessing of God, a more perfect\nand thorough work may be wrought; but if we can have but one part done,\nlet it be the individual labor of opening the Scriptures in households, making\npersonal appeals, and talking familiarly with the members of the family, not\nabout things of little importance, but of the great themes of redemption. Let\nthem see that your heart is burdened for the salvation of souls.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, March 13, 1888.\nGo to the People\nWe are not to wait for souls to come to us; we must seek them out where\nthey are. When the word has been preached in the pulpit, the work has but just\nbegun. There are multitudes who will never be reached by the gospel unless it\nis carried to them.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 229.\nThe gospel commission is the great missionary charter of Christ\u2019s\nkingdom. The disciples were to work earnestly for souls, giving to all the\ninvitation of mercy. They were not to wait for the people to come to them;\nthey were to\n121\ngo to the people with their message.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 28.\nInvite to Your Home for Bible Study\nInvite your neighbors to your home, and read with them from the precious\nBible and from books that explain its truths. Invite them to unite with you in\nsong and prayer. In these little gatherings, Christ Himself will be present, as\nHe has promised, and hearts will be touched by His grace.\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 152, 153.\nWhile in Ephesus, Apollos \u201cbegan to speak boldly in the synagogue.\u201d\nAmong his hearers were Aquila and Priscilla, who, perceiving that he had\nnot yet received the full light of the gospel, \u201ctook him unto them, and\nexpounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.\u201d Through their teaching\nhe obtained a clearer understanding of the Scriptures, and became one of the\nablest advocates of the Christian faith.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 270.\nBe Social\nTo all who are working with Christ I would say, Wherever you can gain\naccess to the people by the \ufb01reside, improve your opportunity. Take your\nBible, and open before them its great truths. Your success will not depend\nso much upon your knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to\n\ufb01nd your way to the heart. By being social and coming close to the people,\nyou may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than by the most able\ndiscourse. The presentation of Christ in the family, by the \ufb01reside, and in\nsmall gatherings in private houses, is often more successful in winning souls\nto Jesus than are sermons delivered in the open air, to the moving throng, or\neven in halls or churches.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 193.\nThe example of Christ in linking Himself with the interests of humanity\nshould be followed by all who preach His word, and by all who have received\nthe gospel of His grace. We are not to renounce social communion. We should\nnot seclude ourselves from others. In order to reach all classes, we must meet\nthem where they are. They will\n122\nseldom seek us of their own accord. Not alone from the pulpit are the hearts\nof men touched by divine truth. There is another \ufb01eld of labor, humbler, it\nmay be, but fully as promising. It is found in the home of the lowly, and in the\nmansion of the great; at the hospitable board, and in gatherings for innocent\nsocial enjoyment.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 152.\nChrist was not exclusive, and He had given special offense to the Pharisees\nby departing in this respect from their rigid rules. He found the domain\nof religion fenced in by high walls of seclusion, as too sacred a matter for\neveryday life. These walls of partition He overthrew. In His contact with\nmen He did not ask, What is your creed? To what church do you belong?\nHe exercised His helping power in behalf of all who needed help. Instead of\nsecluding Himself in a hermit\u2019s cell in order to show His heavenly character,\nHe labored earnestly for humanity. He inculcated the principle that Bible\nreligion does not consist in the morti\ufb01cation of the body. He taught that pure\nand unde\ufb01led religion is not meant only for set times and special occasions.\nAt all times and in all places He manifested a loving interest in men, and shed\nabout Him the light of a cheerful piety.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 86.\nIn face of their prejudices He accepted the hospitality of this despised\npeople. He slept under their roofs, ate with them at their tables,\u2014partaking\nof the food prepared and served by their hands,\u2014taught in their streets, and\ntreated them with the utmost kindness and courtesy.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 193.\nManifest Sympathetic Interest\nThose who are \ufb01ghting the battle of life at great odds may be refreshed\nand strengthened by little attentions which cost nothing. Kindly words simply\nspoken, little attentions simply bestowed, will sweep away the clouds of\ntemptation and doubt that gather over the soul. The true heart-expression of\nChristlike sympathy, given in simplicity, has power to open the door of hearts\nthat need the simple, delicate touch of the Spirit of Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:30.\n123\nThousands of hearts can be reached in the most simple, humble way. The\nmost intellectual, those who are looked upon and praised as the world\u2019s most\ngifted men and women, are often refreshed by the simple words that \ufb02ow from\nthe heart of one who loves God, and who can speak of that love as naturally\nas the worldling speaks of the things which his mind contemplates and feeds\nupon. Often the words well prepared and studied have little in\ufb02uence. But the\ntrue, honest words of a son or daughter of God, spoken in natural simplicity,\nwill open the door to hearts that have long been locked.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:115.\nCite Personal Experience\nThose who have put on Christ will relate their experience, tracing step\nby step the leadings of the Holy Spirit,\u2014their hungering and thirsting for the\nknowledge of God and of Jesus Christ whom He has sent, the result of their\nsearching of the Scriptures, their prayers, their soul-agony, and the words of\nChrist to them, \u201cThy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d It is unnatural for any to keep\nthese things secret, and those who are \ufb01lled with the love of Christ will not\ndo so. In proportion as the Lord has made them the depositaries of sacred\ntruth will be their desire that others shall receive the same blessing. And as\nthey make known the rich treasures of God\u2019s grace, more and still more of the\ngrace of Christ will be imparted to them.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 125.\nArouse every spiritual energy to action. Tell those whom you visit that the\nend of all things is at hand. The Lord Jesus Christ will open the door of their\nhearts, and will make upon their minds lasting impressions. Strive to arouse\nmen and women from their spiritual insensibility. Tell them how you found\nJesus, and how blessed you have been since you gained an experience in His\nservice. Tell them what blessing comes to you as you sit at the feet of Jesus,\nand learn precious lessons from His Word. Tell them of the gladness and joy\nthere is in the Christian life. Your warm, fervent words will convince them\nthat you have found the pearl of great price. Let your cheerful, encouraging\nwords show that you have certainly found the higher way.\n124\nThis is genuine missionary work, and as it is done, many will awake as from\na dream.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:38.\nThose whom God employs as His instruments may be regarded by some\nas inef\ufb01cient; but if they can pray, if in simplicity they can talk the truth\nbecause they love it, they may reach the people through the Holy Spirit\u2019s\npower. As they present the truth in simplicity, reading from the Word, or\nrecalling incidents of experience, the Holy Spirit makes an impression on\nmind and character. The will becomes subordinate to the will of God; the\ntruth heretofore not understood comes to the heart with living conviction, and\nbecomes a spiritual reality.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:444.\nIllustrations Effective\nHis messages of mercy were varied to suit His audience. He knew \u201chow\nto speak a word in season to him that is weary;\u201d for grace was poured upon\nHis lips, that He might convey to men in the most attractive way the treasures\nof truth. He had tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and surprise them with\nillustrations that won their attention. Through the imagination He reached the\nheart. His illustrations were taken from the things of daily life, and although\nthey were simple, they had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The birds\nof the air, the lilies of the \ufb01eld, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,\u2014with\nthese objects Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever afterward, when His\nhearers chanced to see these things in nature, they recalled His words. Christ\u2019s\nillustrations constantly repeated His lessons.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 254.\nDeal with Practical Fundamentals\nThe apostles endeavored to impart to these idolaters a knowledge of God\nthe Creator, and of His Son, the Saviour of the human race. They \ufb01rst directed\nattention to the wonderful works of God,\u2014the sun, the moon, and the stars, the\nbeautiful order of the recurring seasons, the mighty snow-capped mountains,\nthe lofty trees, and other varied wonders of nature, which showed a skill\nbeyond human comprehension. Through these works of the Almighty, the\napostles led the minds of the heathen to a contemplation of the great Ruler of\nthe universe.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 180.\n125\nDeal with Practical Fundamentals\nPaul was an eloquent speaker. Before his conversion, he had often sought\nto impress his hearers by \ufb02ights of oratory. But now he set all this aside.\nInstead of indulging in poetic descriptions and fanciful representations, which\nmight please the senses and feed the imagination, but which would not touch\nthe daily experience, Paul sought by the use of simple language to bring home\nto the heart the truths that are of vital importance. Fanciful representations of\ntruth may cause an ecstasy of feeling; but all too often, truths presented in this\nway do not supply the food necessary to strengthen and fortify the believer\nfor the battles of life. The immediate needs, the present trials, of struggling\nsouls, \u2013these must be met with sound, practical instruction in the fundamental\nprinciples of Christianity.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 251, 252.\nHold to Af\ufb01rmative Truth\nOften, as you seek to present the truth, opposition will be aroused; but\nif you seek to meet the opposition with argument, you will only multiply it,\nand that you cannot afford to do. Hold to the af\ufb01rmative. Angels of God are\nwatching you, and they understand how to impress those whose opposition\nyou refuse to meet with argument. Dwell not on the negative points of\nquestions that arise, but gather to your minds af\ufb01rmative truths, and fasten\nthem there by much earnest prayer and heart-consecration.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:147, 148.\nRepresentatives in the Thoroughfares of Travel\nThose who in response to the call of the hour have entered the service\nof the Master Workman, may well study His methods of labor. During His\nearthly ministry, the Saviour took advantage of the opportunities to be found\nalong the great thoroughfares of travel. It was at Capernaum that Jesus dwelt\nat the intervals of His journeys to and fro, and it came to be known as \u201cHis\nown city.\u201d This city was well adapted to be the center of the Saviour\u2019s work.\nBeing on the highway from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt, and to the\nMediterranean Sea, it was a great thoroughfare of travel. People from many\nlands passed through\n126\nthe city, or tarried for rest on their journeyings to and fro. Here Jesus could\nmeet all nations and all ranks, the rich and great, as well as the poor and\nlowly; and His lessons would be carried to other countries and into many\nhouseholds. Investigation of the prophecies would thus be excited; attention\nwould be directed to the Saviour, and His mission would be brought before\nthe world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:121.\nIn the world-renowned health resorts and centers of tourist traf\ufb01c, crowded\nwith many thousands of seekers after health and pleasure, there should be\nstationed ministers and canvassers capable of arresting the attention of the\nmultitudes. Let these workers watch their chance for presenting the message\nfor this time, and hold meetings as they have opportunity. Let them be quick\nto seize opportunities to speak to the people. Accompanied by the power of\nthe Holy Spirit, let them meet the people with the message borne by John the\nBaptist, \u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d Matthew 3:2. The\nword of God is to be presented with clearness and power, that those who have\nears to hear may hear the truth. Thus the gospel of present truth will be placed\nin the way of those who know it not, and it will be accepted by not a few, and\ncarried by them to their own homes in all parts of the world.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:122.\n\u201cMinistry of Healing\u201d and \u201cChrist\u2019s Object Lessons\u201d are peculiarly\nadapted for use in tourist centers, and everything possible should be done\nto place copies of these works in the hands of those who have leisure and\ninclination to read.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:85.\nHealth restaurants and treatment-rooms should be established. Our efforts\nin these lines should include the great seaside resorts. As the voice of John the\nBaptist was heard in the wilderness, \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord,\u201d so must\nthe voice of the Lord\u2019s messengers be heard in the great tourist and seaside\nresorts.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:55, 56.\nSent Forth Two by Two\nCalling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two and two through\nthe towns and villages. None were\n127\nsent forth alone, but brother was associated with brother, friend with friend.\nThus they could help and encourage each other, counseling and praying\ntogether, each one\u2019s strength supplementing the other\u2019s weakness. In the same\nmanner He afterward sent forth the seventy. It was the Saviour\u2019s purpose that\nthe messengers of the gospel should be associated in this way. In our own\ntime evangelistic work would be far more successful if this example were\nmore closely followed.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 350.\nMedical Evangelistic Tours\nFrom the instruction that the Lord has given me from time to time, I know\nthat there should be workers who make medical evangelistic tours among the\ntowns and villages. Those who do this work will gather a rich harvest of souls,\nfrom both the higher and lower classes. The way for this work is best prepared\nby the efforts of the faithful canvasser.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:172.\nGospel Medical Missionaries\nWorkers\u2014gospel medical missionaries\u2014are needed now. You cannot\nafford to spend years in preparation. Soon doors now open to the truth will\nbe forever closed. Carry the message now. Do not wait, allowing the enemy\nto take possession of the \ufb01elds now open before you. Let little companies go\nforth to do the work to which Christ appointed His disciples. Let them labor\nas evangelists, scattering our publications, and talking of the truth to those\nthey meet. Let them pray for the sick, ministering to their necessities, not with\ndrugs, but with nature\u2019s remedies, and teaching them how to regain health and\navoid disease.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:172.\nMy brethren and sisters, give yourselves to the Lord for service. Allow\nno opportunity to pass unimproved. Visit the sick and suffering, and show\na kindly interest in them. If possible, do something to make them more\ncomfortable. Through this means you can reach their hearts, and speak a word\nfor Christ. Eternity alone will reveal how far-reaching such a line of labor can\nbe. Other lines of\n128\nusefulness will open before those who are willing to do the duty nearest\nthem.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:36.\nIndustrial Education\nThere are multitudes of poor families for whom no better missionary work\ncould be done than to assist them in settling on the land and in learning how to\nmake it yield them a livelihood. The need for such help and instruction is not\ncon\ufb01ned to the cities. Even in the country, with all its possibilities for a better\nlife, multitudes of the poor are in great need. Whole communities are devoid\nof education in industrial and sanitary lines. Families live in hovels, with scant\nfurniture and clothing, without tools, without books, destitute of both comforts\nand conveniences, and of means of culture. Imbruted souls, bodies weak\nand ill-formed, reveal the results of evil heredity and of wrong habits. These\npeople must be educated from the very foundation. They have led shiftless,\nidle, corrupt lives, and they need to be trained to correct habits.\u2014 The Ministry\nof Healing, 192.\nAttention should be given to the establishment of various industries so that\npoor families can \ufb01nd employment. Carpenters, blacksmiths, and indeed every\none who understands some line of useful labor, should feel a responsibility to\nteach and help the ignorant and the unemployed.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing ,\n194.\nChristian farmers can do real missionary work in helping the poor to \ufb01nd\nhomes on the land, and in teaching them how to till the soil and make it\nproductive. Teach them how to use the implements of agriculture, how to\ncultivate various crops, how to plant and care for orchards.\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 193.\nInvite to Gospel Meetings\nIn ministry to the poor there is a wide \ufb01eld of service for women as well as\nfor men. The ef\ufb01cient cook, the housekeeper, the seamstress, the nurse,\u2014the\nhelp of all is needed. Let the members of poor households be taught how to\ncook, how to make and mend their own clothing, how to nurse the sick, how\nto care properly for the home. Let boys and girls be thoroughly taught some\nuseful trade or occupation.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 194.\n129\nInvite to Gospel Meetings\nThere are many things that persons may do if they only have a mind to\nwork. There are many who will not go to church to hear the truth preached.\nBy personal efforts in simplicity and wisdom these might be persuaded to\nturn their feet to the house of God. Conviction may fasten upon their\nminds the \ufb01rst time they hear a discourse upon present truth. Should your\nsolicitations be refused, do not be discouraged. Persevere till success crowns\nyour efforts.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nGather Into the Sabbath School\nAnother work in which all may engage is gathering children and youth\ninto the Sabbath school. The young may in this way labor ef\ufb01ciently for the\ndear Saviour. They may shape the destinies of souls. They may do a work\nfor the church and the world the extent and greatness of which will never be\nknown until the day of \ufb01nal accounts, when the \u201cWell done\u201d is spoken to the\ngood and faithful.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nBy Pen and Voice\nWith pen and voice proclaim that Jesus lives to make intercession for\nus. Unite with the great Master Worker, follow the self-denying Redeemer\nthrough His pilgrimage of love on earth.\u2014 The Review and Herald , January\n24, 1893.\nSome will work in one way and some in another, as the Lord shall call\nand lead them. But they are all to strive together, seeking to make the work\na perfect whole. With pen and voice they are to labor for Him.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:26.\nChrist cruci\ufb01ed,\u2014talk it, pray it, sing it, and it will break and win\nhearts.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:67.\nThe pen is a power in the hands of men who feel the truth burning upon\nthe altar of their hearts, and who have an intelligent zeal for God, balanced\nwith sound judgment. The pen, dipped in the fountain of pure truth, can\nsend the beams of light to dark corners of the earth, which will re\ufb02ect its\nrays back, adding new power, and giving increased light to be scattered\neverywhere.\u2014 Life Sketches, 214.\n130\nOur ministers should not give all their powers to preaching discourses, and\nlet the work end there. They should instruct the members of the church\nhow to take hold of and successfully carry forward this branch of the work\n[missionary correspondence], which is to our tract and missionary society like\na wheel within a wheel. The movement of this inner wheel keeps in healthful,\npowerful action the outer wheel. Let this inner wheel cease its action, and the\nresult will be seen in diminished life and activity in the tract and missionary\nsociety.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nDo not become weary of vigilant missionary labor. This is a work you may\nall engage in successfully, if you will but connect with God. Before writing\nletters of inquiry, always lift up your heart to God in prayer that you may\nbe successful in gathering some wild branches which may be grafted into the\ntrue vine, and bear fruit to the glory of God. All who with humble hearts take\npart in this work, will be continually educating themselves as workers in the\nvineyard of the Lord.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\n131\nChap. 11 - Medical Missionary Work\nA Work of First Importance\nDuring His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick than to\npreaching.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 19.\nBefore the true reformer, the medical missionary work will open many\ndoors.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:62.\nGenuine medical missionary work is the gospel practiced.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 8:168.\nMedical missionary work is the pioneer work of the gospel. In the ministry\nof the word and in the medical missionary work the gospel is to be preached\nand practiced.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 144.\nThe Saviour of the world devoted more time and labor to healing the\naf\ufb02icted of their maladies than to preaching. His last injunction to His\napostles, His representatives upon the earth, was to lay hands on the sick that\nthey might recover. When the Master shall come, He will commend those who\nhave visited the sick and relieved the necessities of the af\ufb02icted.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 4:225.\nHe designs that the medical missionary work shall prepare the way for the\npresentation of the saving truth for this time,\u2014the proclamation of the third\nangel\u2019s message. If this design is met, the message will not be eclipsed nor its\nprogress hindered.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:293.\nFirst meet the temporal necessities of the needy, and relieve their physical\nwants and sufferings, and you will then \ufb01nd an open avenue to the heart, where\nyou may plant the good seeds of virtue and religion.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 4:227.\nNothing will give greater spiritual strength and a greater increase of\nearnestness and depth of feeling, than visiting and ministering to the sick and\nthe desponding, helping them to see the light and to fasten their faith upon\nJesus.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:75, 76.\n132\nThe Divine Example\nChrist, the great medical missionary, is our example.... He healed the sick\nand preached the gospel. In His service, healing and teaching were linked\nclosely together. Today they are not to be separated.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:170, 171.\nChrist\u2019s servants are to follow His example. As He went from place to\nplace, He comforted the suffering and healed the sick. Then He placed before\nthem the great truths in regard to His kingdom. This is the work of His\nfollowers.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 233, 234.\nChrist\u2019s example must be followed by those who claim to be His children.\nRelieve the physical necessities of your fellow men, and their gratitude will\nbreak down the barriers, and enable you to reach their hearts. Consider this\nmatter earnestly.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:127.\nEspecially should those who are medical missionaries manifest, in spirit,\nword, and character, that they are following Christ Jesus, the divine Model of\nmedical missionary effort.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:127.\nCombine with Gospel Ministry\nThe gospel and the medical missionary work are to advance together. The\ngospel is to be bound up with the principles of true health reform. Christianity\nis to be brought into the practical life. Earnest, thorough, reformatory work\nis to be done.... We are to present the principles of health reform before the\npeople, doing all in our power to lead men and women to see the necessity of\nthese principles, and to practice them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:379.\nIt is the divine plan that we shall work as the disciples worked. Physical\nhealing is bound up with the gospel commission. In the work of the gospel,\nteaching and healing are never to be separated.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 141.\nMedical missionary work and the gospel ministry are the channels through\nwhich God seeks to pour a constant supply of His goodness. They are to be as\nthe river of\n133\nlife for the irrigation of His church.\u2014 The Bible Echo, August 12, 1901.\nLet our ministers, who have gained an experience in preaching the word,\nlearn how to give simple treatments, and then labor intelligently as medical\nmissionary evangelists.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:172.\nAs the canvasser goes from place to place, he will \ufb01nd many who are\nsick. He should have a practical knowledge of the causes of disease, and\nshould understand how to give simple treatments, that he may relieve the\nsuffering ones. More than this, he should pray in faith and simplicity for the\nsick, pointing them to the great Physician. As he thus walks and works with\nGod, ministering angels are beside him, giving him access to hearts. What a\nwide \ufb01eld for missionary effort lies before the faithful, consecrated canvasser;\nwhat a blessing he will receive in the diligent performance of his work!\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, November 20, 1902.\nEvery gospel worker should feel that the giving of instruction in the\nprinciples of healthful living, is a part of his appointed work. Of this work\nthere is great need, and the world is open for it.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing ,\n147.\nRight Arm of the Message\nAgain and again I have been instructed that the medical missionary work\nis to bear the same relation to the work of the third angel\u2019s message that the\narm and hand bear to the body. Under the direction of the divine Head they are\nto work unitedly in preparing the way for the coming of Christ. The right arm\nof the body of truth is to be constantly active, constantly at work, and God will\nstrengthen it. But it is not to be made the body. At the same time the body is\nnot to say to the arm, \u201cI have no need of thee.\u201d The body has need of the arm\nin order to do active, aggressive work. Both have their appointed work, and\neach will suffer great loss if worked independently of the other.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 6:288.\nMedical missionary work is to be done.... It is to be to the work of God as\nthe hand is to the body.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:160.\n134\nDivine Co-operation\nChrist feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil spirits rend a human\nframe, Christ feels the curse. When fever is burning up the life current, He\nfeels the agony. And He is just as willing to heal the sick now, as when He\nwas personally on earth. Christ\u2019s servants are His representatives, the channels\nfor His working. He desires through them to exercise His healing power.\u2014The\nDesire of Ages, 823, 824.\nThrough His servants, God designs that the sick, the unfortunate, and those\npossessed of evil spirits, shall hear His voice. Through His human agencies\nHe desires to be a comforter, such as the world knows not.\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 106.\nChrist co-operates with those who engage in medical missionary\nwork.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:51.\nThe Lord wrought through them. Wherever they went, the sick were\nhealed, and the poor had the gospel preached unto them.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 106.\nChrist is no longer in this world in person, to go through our cities and\ntowns and villages, healing the sick; but He has commissioned us to carry\nforward the medical missionary work that He began.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:168.\nThe Work of Every Church\nThere is a message regarding health reform to be borne in every\nchurch.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:370.\nThe medical missionary work should be a part of the work of every church\nin our land.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:289.\nWe have come to a time when every member of the church should take\nhold of medical missionary work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:62.\nThe work of health reform is the Lord\u2019s means for lessening suffering in\nour world and for purifying His church. Teach the people that they can act\nas God\u2019s helping hand, by co-operating with the Master Worker in restoring\nphysical and spiritual health. This work bears the signature of Heaven, and\nwill open doors for the entrance of other precious truths. There is room for all\nto labor who will\n135\ntake hold of this work intelligently.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:112, 113.\nThere are stormy times before us, but let us not utter one word of unbelief\nor discouragement. Let us remember that we bear a message of healing to a\nworld \ufb01lled with sin-sick souls.\u2014 Special Testimonies Series B, No. 8, p. 24.\nThis work, properly conducted, will save many a poor sinner who has\nbeen neglected by the churches. Many not of our faith are longing for the\nvery help that Christians are in duty bound to give. If God\u2019s people would\nshow a genuine interest in their neighbors, many would be reached by the\nspecial truths for this time. Nothing will or ever can give character to the\nwork like helping the people just where they are. Thousands might today\nbe rejoicing in the message, if those who claim to love God and keep His\ncommandments would work as Christ worked. When the medical missionary\nwork thus wins men and women to a saving knowledge of Christ and His truth,\nmoney and earnest labor may safely be invested in it; for it is a work that will\nendure.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:280.\nLet our people show that they have a living interest in medical missionary\nwork. Let them prepare themselves for usefulness by studying the books that\nhave been written for our instruction in these lines. These books deserve\nmuch more attention and appreciation than they have received. Much that is\nfor the bene\ufb01t of all to understand has been written for the special purpose\nof instruction in the principles of health. Those who study and practice\nthese principles will be greatly blessed, both physically and spiritually. An\nunderstanding of the philosophy of health will be a safeguard against many of\nthe evils that are continually increasing,\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:63.\nI have been instructed that the medical missionary work will discover, in\nthe very depths of degradation, men who, though they have given themselves\nup to intemperate, dissolute habits, will respond to the right kind of labor. But\nthey need to be recognized and encouraged. Firm, patient, earnest effort will\nbe required in order to lift them up.\n136\nThey cannot restore themselves. They may hear Christ\u2019s call, but their ears\nare too dull to take in its meaning; their eyes are too blind to see anything\ngood in store for them. They are dead in trespasses and sins. Yet even\nthese are not to be excluded from the gospel feast. They are to receive the\ninvitation, \u201cCome.\u201d Though they may feel unworthy, the Lord says, \u201cCompel\nthem to come in.\u201d Listen to no excuse. By love and kindness lay right hold of\nthem,\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:279, 280.\nThose who take up this line of work [circulating publications] are to go\nprepared to do medical missionary work. The sick and suffering are to be\nhelped. Many for whom this work of mercy is done will hear and accept the\nwords of life.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:34.\nWho is preparing to take hold understandingly of medical missionary\nwork? ... Every worker should be understandingly ef\ufb01cient. Then in a high,\nbroad sense he can present the truth as it is in Jesus.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 7:70.\nLet the Lord\u2019s work go forward. Let the medical missionary and the\neducational work go forward. I am sure that this is our great lack,\u2014earnest,\ndevoted, intelligent, capable workers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church 9:168,\n169.\nLet them take the living principle of health reform into the communities\nthat to a large degree are ignorant of these principles.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:118.\nI am instructed to say to health reform educators, Go forward. The\nworld needs every jot of the in\ufb02uence you can exert to press back the tide\nof moral woe. Let those who teach the third angel\u2019s message stand true to\ntheir colors.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:113.\nThe Medical Extension Plan\nThe Lord will give to our sanitariums whose work is already established\nan opportunity to co-operate with Him in assisting newly established plants.\nEvery new institution is to be regarded as a sister helper in the great work\nof proclaiming the third angel\u2019s message. God has given our sanitariums an\nopportunity to set in operation a work\n137\nthat will be as a stone instinct with life, growing as it is rolled by an invisible\nhand. Let this mystic stone be set in motion.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:59.\nInstitutional Work\nHealth restaurants and treatment-rooms should be established. Our efforts\nin these lines should include the great seaside resorts. As the voice of John the\nBaptist was heard in the wilderness, \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord,\u201d so must\nthe voice of the Lord\u2019s messengers be heard in the great tourist and seaside\nresorts.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:55, 56.\nI have been given light that in many cities it is advisable for a restaurant to\nbe connected with treatment-rooms. The two can co-operate in upholding right\nprinciples. In connection with these it is sometimes advisable to have rooms\nthat will serve as lodgings for the sick. These establishments will serve as\nfeeders to the sanitariums located in the country.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:60.\nThe Lord has a message for our cities, and this message we are to proclaim\nin our camp-meetings, and by other public efforts, and also through our\npublications. In addition to this, hygienic restaurants are to be established\nin the cities, and by them the message of temperance is to be proclaimed.\nArrangements should be made to hold meetings in connection with our\nrestaurants. Whenever possible, let a room be provided where the patrons\ncan be invited to lectures on the science of health and Christian temperance,\nwhere they can receive instruction on the preparation of wholesome food, and\non other important subjects.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:115.\nThose who come to our restaurants should be supplied with reading matter.\nTheir attention should be called to our literature on temperance and dietetic\nreform, and lea\ufb02ets treating on the lessons of Christ should also be given\nthem. The burden of supplying this reading matter should be shared by all\nour people. All who come should be given something to read. It may be that\nmany will leave the tract unread, but some among those in whose hands you\n138\nplace it may be searching for light. They will read and study what you give\nthem, and then pass it on to others.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:116.\nI have been instructed that one of the principal reasons why hygienic\nrestaurants and treatment-rooms should be established in the centers of large\ncities, is that by this means the attention of leading men will be called to the\nthird angel\u2019s message. Noticing that these restaurants are conducted in a way\naltogether different from the way in which ordinary restaurants are conducted,\nmen of intelligence will begin to inquire into the reasons for the difference\nin business methods, and will investigate the principles that lead us to serve\nsuperior food. Thus they will be led to a knowledge of the message for this\ntime.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:122, 123.\nCooking Schools\nI have been instructed to encourage the conducting of cooking schools in\nall places where medical missionary work is being done. Every inducement\nto lead people to reform must be held out before them. Let as much light as\npossible shine upon them. Teach them to make every improvement that they\ncan in the preparation of food, and encourage them to impart to others that\nwhich they learn.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 362, 363.\nCooking schools are to be held. The people are to be taught how to prepare\nwholesome food. They are to be shown the need of discarding unhealthful\nfoods. But we should never advocate a starvation diet. It is possible to have\na wholesome, nutritious diet without the use of tea, coffee, and \ufb02esh food.\nThe work of teaching the people how to prepare a dietary that is at once\nwholesome and appetizing, is of the utmost importance.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:112.\nA Timely Message\nI cannot too strongly urge all our church members, all who are true\nmissionaries, all who believe the third angel\u2019s message, all who turn away\ntheir feet from the Sabbath, to consider the message of the \ufb01fty-eighth chapter\nof Isaiah.\n139\nThe work of bene\ufb01cence enjoined in this chapter is the work that God requires\nHis people to do at this time. It is a work of His own appointment. We are\nnot left in doubt as to where the message applies, and the time of its marked\nful\ufb01llment, for we read: \u201cThey that shall be of thee shall build the old waste\nplaces; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt\nbe called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.\u201d\nGod\u2019s memorial, the seventh-day Sabbath, the sign of His work in creating\nthe world, has been displaced by the man of sin. God\u2019s people have a special\nwork to do in repairing the breach that has been made in His law; and the\nnearer we approach the end, the more urgent this work becomes. All who love\nGod will show that they bear His sign by keeping His commandments. They\nare the restorers of paths to dwell in.... Genuine medical missionary work is\nbound up inseparably with the keeping of God\u2019s commandments, of which\nthe Sabbath is especially mentioned, since it is the great memorial of God\u2019s\ncreative work. Its observance is bound up with the work of restoring the moral\nimage of God in man. This is the ministry which God\u2019s people are to carry\nforward at this time. This ministry, rightly performed, will bring rich blessings\nto the church.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:265, 266.\n140\nChap. 12 - Bible Evangelism\nA Heaven-born Idea\nThe plan of holding Bible readings was a heaven-born idea. There are\nmany, both men and women, who can engage in this branch of missionary\nlabor. Workers may thus be developed who will become mighty men of\nGod. By this means the Word of God has been given to thousands; and\nthe workers are brought into personal contact with people of all nations\nand tongues. The Bible is brought into families, and its sacred truths come\nhome to the conscience. Men are entreated to read, examine, and judge for\nthemselves, and they must abide the responsibility of receiving or rejecting\nthe divine enlightenment. God will not permit this precious work for Him to\ngo unrewarded. He will crown with success every humble effort made in His\nname.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 192.\nOur work has been marked out for us by our heavenly Father. We are to\ntake our Bibles, and go forth to warn the world. We are to be God\u2019s helping\nhands in saving souls,\u2014channels through which His love is day by day to \ufb02ow\nto the perishing.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:150.\nThe De\ufb01nite Call\nMany will be called into the \ufb01eld to labor from house to house, giving\nBible readings, and praying with those who are interested.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:172.\nMany workers are to act their part, doing house-to-house work, and giving\nBible readings in families.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:141.\nConsecrated women should engage in Bible work from house to\nhouse.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:120, 121.\nIf we follow in Christ\u2019s footsteps, we must come close to those who\nneed our ministry. We must open the Bible to the understanding, present the\nclaims of God\u2019s law, read the promises to the hesitating, arouse the careless,\nstrengthen the weak.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 336.\n141\nIn the experience of Philip and the Ethiopian is presented the work to\nwhich the Lord calls His people. The Ethiopian represents a large class\nwho need missionaries like Philip, missionaries who will hear the voice of\nGod, and go where He sends them. There are those in the world who are\nreading the Scriptures, but who cannot understand their import. The men and\nwomen who have a knowledge of God are needed to explain the word to these\nsouls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:58, 59.\nAmong the members of our churches there should be more house-to-house\nlabor, in giving Bible readings.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:127.\nLet the workers go from house to house, opening the Bible to the\npeople.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:123.\nIn many States there are settlements of industrious, well-to-do farmers,\nwho have never had the truth for this time. Such places should be worked.\nLet our lay members take up this line of service. By lending or selling\nbooks, by distributing papers, and by holding Bible readings, our lay members\ncould do much in their own neighborhoods. Filled with love for souls,\nthey could proclaim the message with such power that many would be\nconverted.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:35.\nImpressive Scenes\nHundreds and thousands were seen visiting families, and opening before\nthem the Word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of the Holy Spirit,\nand a spirit of genuine conversion was manifest.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:126.\nTwo Bible workers were seated in a family. With the open Bible before\nthem, they presented the Lord Jesus Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour.\nEarnest prayer was offered to God, and hearts were softened and subdued\nby the in\ufb02uence of the Spirit of God. Their prayers were uttered with\nfreshness and power. As the Word of God was explained, I saw that a soft,\nradiant light illumined the Scriptures, and I said softly, \u201cGo out into the\nhighways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be\n\ufb01lled.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:35.\n142\nThere are many who are reading the Scriptures who cannot understand\ntheir true import. All over the world men and women are looking wistfully to\nheaven. Prayers and tears and inquiries go up from souls longing for light, for\ngrace, for the Holy Spirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only\nto be gathered in.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 109.\nPreparation for the Work\nThe followers of Jesus are not meeting the mind and will of God, if they\nare content to remain in ignorance of His Word. All should become Bible\nstudents. Christ commanded His followers, \u201cSearch the Scriptures; for in them\nye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.\u201d Peter\nexhorts us, \u201cBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to\ngive an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you\nwith meekness and fear.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:633, 634.\nThose who are truly converted must become more and more intelligent in\ntheir understanding of the Scriptures, that they may be able to speak words\nof light and salvation to those who are in darkness and perishing in their\nsins.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:121.\nWe are to give the last warning of God to men, and what should be\nour earnestness in studying the Bible, and our zeal in spreading the light!\nLet every soul who has received the divine illumination seek to impart it.\nLet the workers go from house to house, opening the Bible to the people,\ncirculating the publications, telling others of the light that has blessed their\nown souls.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 353.\nA well-balanced work can be carried on best when a training school for\nBible workers is in progress. While the public meetings are being held,\nconnected with this training school or city mission should be experienced\nlaborers of deep spiritual understanding, who can give the Bible workers daily\ninstruction, and who can also unite wholeheartedly in the general public effort\nbeing put forth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:111.\n143\nSecret of Success\nBring earnestness and fervency into your prayers, and into your Bible\nreadings, and into your preaching, that you may leave the impression that the\nsacred truths you are presenting to others are to you a living reality. Whatever\nyou do for Jesus, seek with all your powers to do it with earnestness. Never\nfeel that you have attained to the highest point, and can therefore rise no\nhigher.... Set your mind to task, that you may present the truth in a manner\nto interest them. Seize the most interesting portions of Scripture that you can\nbring before them, come right to the point, and seek to fasten their attention,\nand instruct them in the ways of the Lord.\u2014 The Review and Herald, July 26,\n1887.\nA great work can be done by presenting to the people the Bible just\nas it reads. Carry the Word of God to every man\u2019s door, urge its plain\nstatements upon every man\u2019s conscience, repeat to all the Saviour\u2019s command,\n\u201cSearch the Scriptures.\u201d Admonish them to take the Bible as it is, to implore\ndivine enlightenment, and then, when the light shines, to gladly accept each\nprecious ray, and fearlessly abide the consequences.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:388.\nA Joyous Work\nIt is a joyous work to open the Scriptures to others.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:118.\nOpen the Scriptures to some one that is in darkness, and you will not\ncomplain of weariness and lack of interest in the cause of truth. Your heart\nwill be awakened to an anxiety for souls, and joy in the evidences of the faith\nwill \ufb01ll your heart, and you will know that \u201che that watereth shall be watered\nalso himself.\u201d\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 13, 1888.\n144\nChap. 13 - Ministry of the Printed Page\nWork of First Importance\nIf there is one work more important than another, it is that of getting our\npublications before the public, thus leading them to search the Scriptures.\nMissionary work\u2014introducing our publications into families, conversing, and\npraying with and for them\u2014is a good work.\u2014 The Colporteur Evangelist, 80.\nLet every Seventh-day Adventist ask himself, \u201cWhat can I do to proclaim\nthe third angel\u2019s message?\u201d Christ came to this world to give this message to\nHis servant to give to the churches. It is to be proclaimed to every nation,\nkindred, tongue, and people. How are we to give it? The distribution of\nour literature is one means by which the message is to be proclaimed. Let\nevery believer scatter broadcast tracts and lea\ufb02ets and books containing the\nmessage for this time. Colporteurs are needed who will go forth to circulate\nour publications everywhere.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, January 5, 1904.\nPapers and books are the Lord\u2019s means of keeping the message for this\ntime continually before the people. In enlightening and con\ufb01rming souls in\nthe truth, the publications will do a far greater work than can be accomplished\nby the ministry of the word alone. The silent messengers that are placed in\nthe homes of the people through the work of the canvasser, will strengthen\nthe gospel ministry in every way; for the Holy Spirit will impress minds as\nthey read the books, just as He impresses the minds of those who listen to\nthe preaching of the word. The same ministry of angels attends the books\nthat contain the truth as attends the work of the minister.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:315, 316.\nLet not the canvassing work be left to languish. Let the books containing\nthe light on present truth be placed before as many as possible. The presidents\nof our conferences and others in responsible positions have a duty to do in this\nmatter.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 25, 1905.\n145\nThe world is to receive the light of truth through an evangelizing ministry\nof the word in our books and periodicals. Our publications are to show that\nthe end of all things is at hand.\u2014 The Colporteur Evangelist, 100.\nGod calls upon His people to act like living men, and not be indolent,\nsluggish, and indifferent. We must carry the publications to the people and\nurge them to accept.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 25, 1905.\nOur publications are now sowing the gospel seed, and are instrumental in\nbringing as many souls to Christ as the preached word. Whole churches have\nbeen raised up as the result of their circulation. In this work every disciple of\nChrist can act a part.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nA messenger from heaven stood in our midst, and he spoke words of\nwarning and instruction. He made us clearly understand that the gospel of\nthe kingdom is the message for which the world is perishing, and that this\nmessage, as contained in our publications already in print, and those yet\nto be issued, should be circulated among the people who are nigh and afar\noff.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:67.\nThe book work should be the means of quickly giving the sacred light of\npresent truth to the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:69.\nSatan is busy in this department of his work, scattering literature which\nis debasing the morals and poisoning the minds of the young. In\ufb01del\npublications are scattered broadcast throughout the land. Why should\nnot every member of the church be as deeply interested in sending forth\npublications that will elevate the minds of the people, and bring the truth\ndirectly before them? These papers and tracts are for the light of the world, and\nhave often been instrumental in converting souls.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nJune 10, 1880.\nWe have been asleep, as it were, regarding the work that may be\naccomplished by the circulation of well-prepared literature. Let us now, by the\nwise use of periodicals and books, preach the word with determined energy,\nthat the world may understand the message that Christ gave to\n146\nJohn on the isle of Patmos.\u2014 The Colporteur Evangelist, 101.\nChurch members, awake to the importance of the circulation of our\nliterature, and devote more time to this work. Place in the homes of the people\npapers, tracts, and books that will preach the gospel in its several lines. There\nis no time to be lost. Let many give themselves willingly and unsel\ufb01shly to\nthe canvassing work, and thus help to sound a warning that is greatly needed.\nWhen the church takes up her appointed work, she will go forth \u201cfair as the\nmoon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.\u201d\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, November 20, 1902.\nThe light of truth is shedding its bright beams upon the world through\nmissionary effort. The press is an instrumentality by which many are reached\nwhom it would be impossible to reach by ministerial effort.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:388.\nThe night of trial is nearly spent. Satan is bringing in his masterly power\nbecause he knoweth that his time is short. The chastisement of God is upon\nthe world, to call all who know the truth to hide in the cleft of the Rock, and\nview the glory of God. The truth must not be muf\ufb02ed now. Plain statements\nmust be made. Unvarnished truth must be spoken, in lea\ufb02ets and pamphlets,\nand these must be scattered like the leaves of autumn.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:231.\nCanvassers are needed to take up the work of carrying these silent\nmessengers of truth to the people,\u2014canvassers who feel a burden for souls,\nand who can speak words in season to those who are seeking for light. Some\nmay say, \u201cI am not a minister; I cannot preach to the people,\u201d You may not be\nable to preach, but you can be an evangelist, ministering to the needs of those\nwith whom you come in contact; you can be God\u2019s helping hand, working\nas the disciples worked; you can ask those you meet if they love the Lord\nJesus.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, November 20, 1902.\nPublishing Houses Effective Agencies\nSeventh-day Adventists have been chosen by God as a peculiar people,\nseparate from the world. By the great\n147\ncleaver of truth He has cut them out from the quarry of the world, and brought\nthem into connection with Himself. He has made them His representatives,\nand has called them to be ambassadors for Him in the last work of salvation.\nThe greatest wealth of truth ever intrusted to mortals, the most solemn and\nfearful warnings ever sent by God to man, have been committed to them to\nbe given to the world; and in the accomplishment of this work our publishing\nhouses are among the most effective agencies.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n7:138.\nOur publishing work was established by the direction of God and under\nHis special supervision.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:138.\nIn a large degree through our publishing houses is to be accomplished the\nwork of that other angel who comes down from heaven with great power, and\nwho lightens the earth with his glory.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:140.\nI am bidden to say to our publishing houses: \u201cLift up the standard; lift it\nup higher. Proclaim the third angel\u2019s message, that it may be heard by all the\nworld. Let it be seen that \u2018here are they that keep the commandments of God,\nand the faith of Jesus.\u2019 Revelation 14:12. Let our literature give the message\nas a witness to all the world.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:61.\nPublishing Extension\nYou who believe the truth for this time, wake up. It is your duty now\nto bring in all the means possible to help those who understand the truth\nto proclaim it. Part of the money that comes in from the sale of our\npublications should be used to increase our facilities for the production of\nmore literature that will open blind eyes and break up the fallow ground of the\nheart.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:62.\nYears ago the Lord gave me special directions that buildings should\nbe erected in various places in America, Europe, and other lands, for the\npublication of literature containing the light of present truth. He gave\ninstruction that every effort should be made to send forth to the world from\nthe press the messages of invitation and warning. Some will be\n148\nreached by our literature who would not be reached in any other way. From\nour books and papers bright beams of light are to shine forth to enlighten the\nworld in regard to present truth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:87.\nI have been shown that our publications should be printed in different\nlanguages and sent to every civilized country, at any cost. What is the value\nof money at this time, in comparison with the value of souls? Every dollar of\nour means should be considered as the Lord\u2019s, not ours; and as a precious trust\nfrom God to us; not to be wasted for needless indulgences, but carefully used\nin the cause of God, in the work of saving men and women from ruin.\u2014 Life\nSketches, 214.\nThe printed word of truth is to be translated into different languages, and\ncarried to the ends of the earth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:26.\nThese publications are to be translated into every language; for to all the\nworld the gospel is to be preached. To every worker Christ promises the divine\nef\ufb01ciency that will make his labors a success.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:34.\nOur publications should go everywhere. Let them be issued in many\nlanguages. The third angel\u2019s message is to be given through this medium\nand through the living teacher. You who believe the truth for this time, wake\nup.\u2014 The Colporteur Evangelist, 101.\nMany of God\u2019s people are to go forth with our publications into places\nwhere the third angel\u2019s message has never been proclaimed. Our books are to\nbe published in many different languages. With these books, humble, faithful\nmen are to go out as colporteur-evangelists, bearing the truth to those who\nwould otherwise never be enlightened.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:33, 34.\nFrom city to city, from country to country, they are to carry the publications\ncontaining the promises of the Saviour\u2019s soon coming.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:34.\nI have been shown that the publications already have been doing a work\nupon some minds in other countries in breaking down the walls of prejudice\nand superstition. I\n149\nwas shown men and women studying with intense interest papers and few\npages of tracts upon present truth. They would read the evidences so\nwonderful and new to them, and would open their Bibles with a deep and\nnew interest, as subjects of truth that had been dark to them were made plain,\nespecially the light in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. As\nthey searched the Scriptures to see if these things were so, a new light shone\nupon their understanding, for angels were hovering over them, and impressing\ntheir minds with the truths contained in the publications they had been reading.\nI saw them holding papers and tracts in one hand, and the Bible in the\nother, while their cheeks were wet with tears; and bowing before God in\nearnest, humble prayer, to be guided into all truth,\u2014the very thing He was\ndoing for them before they called upon Him. And when the truth was received\nin their hearts, and they saw the harmonious chain of truth, the Bible was to\nthem a new book; they hugged it to their hearts with grateful joy, while their\ncountenances were all aglow with happiness and holy joy.\nThese were not satis\ufb01ed with merely enjoying the light themselves, and\nthey began to work for others. Some made great sacri\ufb01ces for the truth\u2019s sake\nand to help those of the brethren who were in darkness. The way is thus\npreparing to do a great work in the distribution of tracts and papers in other\nlanguages.\u2014 Life Sketches, 214, 215.\nOpportunities for Free Distribution\nLet literature be distributed judiciously on the trains, in the street, on the\ngreat ships that ply the sea, and through the mails.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 353.\nIn these days of travel, the opportunities for coming in contact with men\nand women of all classes, and of many nationalities, are much greater than in\nthe days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have multiplied a thousandfold.\nGod has wonderfully prepared the way. The agency of the printing press, with\nits manifold facilities, is at our command. Bibles, and publications in many\nlanguages, setting forth the truth for this time, are at our hand, and can\n150\nbe swiftly carried to every part of the world.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 352.\nLet the lea\ufb02ets and tracts, the papers and books, go in every direction.\nCarry with you, wherever you go, a package of select tracts, which you can\nhand out as you have opportunity. Sell what you can, and lend or give them\naway as the case may seem to require. Important results will follow.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, June 10, 1880.\nI have been shown that we were not doing our duty in the gratuitous\ncirculation of small publications. There are many honest souls who might\nbe brought to embrace the truth by this means alone.... These small tracts of\nfour, eight, or sixteen pages, can be furnished for a tri\ufb02e, from a fund raised\nby the donations of those who have the cause at heart. When you write to a\nfriend, you can inclose one or more without increasing postage. When you\nmeet persons in the cars, on the boat, or in the stage, who seem to have an ear\nto hear, you can hand them a tract.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:551, 552.\nSecure Subscriptions\nThe sisters can work ef\ufb01ciently in obtaining subscribers for our\nperiodicals, in this way bringing the light before many minds.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, June 10, 1880.\nWe now have great facilities for spreading the truth; but our people are\nnot coming up to the privileges given them. They do not in every church\nsee and feel the necessity of using their abilities in saving souls. They do\nnot realize their duty to obtain subscribers for our periodicals, including our\nhealth journal, and to introduce our books and pamphlets.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 4:391.\nSelling Books\nMany are sad and discouraged, weak in faith and trust. Let them do\nsomething to help some one more needy than themselves, and they will grow\nstrong in God\u2019s strength. Let them engage in the good work of selling our\nbooks. Thus they will help others, and the experience gained will\n151\ngive them the assurance that they are God\u2019s helping hand. As they plead with\nthe Lord to help them, He will guide them to those who are seeking for the\nlight. Christ will be close beside them, teaching them what to say and do.\nBy comforting others, they themselves will be comforted.\u2014 The Colporteur\nEvangelist, 40.\nWork in Cities\nWe are living in a time when a great work is to be done. There is a\nfamine in the land for the pure gospel, and the bread of life is to be given to\nhungry souls. There is no better opportunity to do this work than that offered\nto the consecrated canvasser. Thousands of books containing the precious\nlight of present truth should be placed in the homes of the people in our large\ncities.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, November 20, 1902.\nBlessed, soul-saving Bible truths are published in our papers. There are\nmany who can help in the work of selling our periodicals. The Lord calls\nupon all of us to seek to save perishing souls. Satan is at work to deceive\nthe very elect, and now is our time to work with vigilance. Our books and\npapers are to be brought before the notice of the people; the gospel of present\ntruth is to be given to our cities without delay. Shall we not arouse to our\nduties?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:63.\nHealth Literature\nCanvassers should call the attention of those they visit to our health\npublications, telling them of the valuable instruction these periodicals contain\nregarding the care of the sick and treatment of diseases. Tell them this\ninstruction, studied and practiced, will bring health to the family. Explain how\nimportant it is for every family to understand the science of life. Direct their\nminds to Him who formed and who keeps in motion the wonderful machinery\nof the body. Tell them that it is our part to co-operate with God, caring wisely\nfor all our faculties and organs.\nThe proper care of the body is a great responsibility, and requires an\nintelligent knowledge of its parts. Tell them that God is dishonored when,\nfor the grati\ufb01cation of\n152\nappetite and passion, man misuses the machinery of the body, so that it does\nits work feebly and with dif\ufb01culty. Tell them that the books you have for\nsale give much valuable instruction regarding health, and that by practicing\nthis instruction, much suffering and also much of the money spent in paying\ndoctors\u2019 bills, will be saved. Tell them that in these books there is advice\nwhich they cannot possibly obtain from their physician during the short visits\nhe makes.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, November 20, 1902.\nWhen young men take up the canvassing work \ufb01lled with an intense\nlonging to save their fellow men, they will see souls converted. From their\nwork a harvest for the Lord will be reaped. Then let them go forth as\nmissionaries to circulate present truth, praying constantly for increased light\nand knowledge, that they may know how to speak words in season to those\nthat are weary. They should improve every opportunity for doing a deed of\nkindness, remembering that thus they are doing errands for the Lord.... In\ntheir work they should always take some health books with them; for health\nreform is the right hand of the message.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, January\n15, 1903.\nCirculate Without Discrimination\nThere are many places in which the voice of the minister cannot be heard,\nplaces which can be reached only by publications,\u2014the books, papers, and\ntracts that are \ufb01lled with the Bible truth that the people need. Our literature\nis to be distributed everywhere. The truth is to be sown beside all waters; for\nwe know not which shall prosper, this or that. In our erring judgment we may\nthink it unwise to give literature to the very ones who would accept the truth\nmost readily. We know not what may be the good results of giving away a\nlea\ufb02et containing present truth.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, January 5, 1904.\nTreasure Every Fragment\nIn the miracle of feeding the multitude with a few loaves and \ufb01shes, the\nfood was increased as it passed from Christ to those who received it. Thus it\nwill be in the distribution\n153\nof our literature. God\u2019s truth, as it is passed out, will multiply greatly. And\nas the disciples, by Christ\u2019s direction, gathered up the fragments, that nothing\nmight be lost, so we should treasure every fragment of literature containing\nthe truth for this time. None can estimate the in\ufb02uence that even a torn page\ncontaining the truths of the third angel\u2019s message may have upon the heart of\nsome seeker after truth.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, January 5, 1904.\nEstablish Depositories\nIn every important place there should be a depository for publications. And\nsome one who really appreciates the truth should manifest an interest to get\nthese books into the hands of all who will read.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n1:473.\nAngels Prepare the Way\nI saw that the work of present truth should engage the interest of all. The\npublication of truth is God\u2019s ordained plan, as a means of warning, comforting,\nreproving, exhorting, or convicting all to whose notice the silent, voiceless\nmessengers may be brought. Angels of God have a part to act in preparing\nhearts to be sancti\ufb01ed by the truths published, that they may be prepared for\nthe solemn scenes before them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:590.\n154\nChap. 14 - Religious Liberty\nAn Appropriate Prayer\nDavid prayed, \u201cIt is time for Thee, Lord, to work: for they have made void\nThy law.\u201d This prayer is no less pertinent at the present time. The world has\ngone astray from God, and its lawless state should strike terror to the heart, and\nlead all who are loyal to the great King to work for a reformation. The papal\npower has thought to change the law of God by substituting a spurious Sabbath\nfor that of Jehovah; and all through the religious world the false sabbath is\nrevered, while the true one is trampled beneath unholy feet....\nIt is on the law of God that the last great struggle of the controversy\nbetween Christ and His angels and Satan and his angels will come, and it\nwill be decisive for all the world.... Men in responsible positions will not\nonly ignore and despise the Sabbath themselves, but from the sacred desk will\nurge upon the people the observance of the \ufb01rst day of the week, pleading\ntradition and custom in behalf of this man-made institution. They will point to\ncalamities on land and sea\u2014to the storms of wind, the \ufb02oods, the earthquakes,\nthe destruction by \ufb01re\u2014as judgments indicating God\u2019s displeasure because\nSunday is not sacredly observed. These calamities will increase more and\nmore, one disaster will follow close upon the heels of another; and those who\nmake void the law of God will point to the few who are keeping the Sabbath\nof the fourth commandment as the ones who are bringing wrath upon the\nworld. This falsehood is Satan\u2019s device that he may ensnare the unwary.\u2014The\nSouthern Watchman, June 28, 1904.\nComing Events\nOur people have been regarded as too insigni\ufb01cant to be worthy of notice;\nbut a change will come. The Christian world is now making movements which\nwill necessarily bring commandment-keeping people into prominence. There\nis a constant supplanting of God\u2019s truth by the theories and\n155\nfalse doctrines of human origin. Movements are being set on foot to enslave\nthe consciences of those who would be loyal to God. The law-making powers\nwill be against God\u2019s people. Every soul will be tested.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:546.\nMen will exalt and rigidly enforce laws that are in direct opposition to\nthe law of God. Though zealous in enforcing their own commandments, they\nwill turn away from a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Exalting a spurious rest day,\nthey will seek to force men to dishonor the law of Jehovah, the transcript of His\ncharacter. Though innocent of wrong-doing, the servants of God will be given\nover to suffer humiliation and abuse at the hands of those who, inspired by\nSatan, are \ufb01lled with envy and religious bigotry.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:229.\nReligious powers, allied to heaven by profession, and claiming to have\nthe characteristics of a lamb, will show by their acts that they have the heart\nof a dragon, and that they are instigated and controlled by Satan. The time\nis coming when God\u2019s people will feel the hand of persecution because they\nkeep holy the seventh day.... But God\u2019s people are to stand \ufb01rm for Him.\nAnd the Lord will work in their behalf, showing plainly that He is the God of\ngods.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:229, 230.\nEvery indignity, reproach, and cruelty that Satan could instigate human\nhearts to devise, has been visited upon the followers of Jesus. And it will be\nagain ful\ufb01lled in a marked manner; for the carnal heart is still at enmity with\nthe law of God, and will not be subject to its commands. The world is no more\nin harmony with the principles of Christ today than it was in the days of the\napostles. The same hatred that prompted the cry. \u201cCrucify Him! crucify Him!\u201d\nthe same hatred that led to the persecution of the disciples, still works in the\nchildren of disobedience. The same spirit which in the Dark Ages consigned\nmen and women to prison, to exile, and to death, which conceived the exquisite\ntorture of the Inquisition, which planned and executed the massacre of St.\nBartholomew, and which kindled the \ufb01res of Smith\ufb01eld, is still at work with\nmalignant energy in unregenerate\n156\nhearts. The history of truth has ever been the record of a struggle between right\nand wrong. The proclamation of the gospel has ever been carried forward in\nthis world in the face of opposition, peril, loss, and suffering.\u2014 The Acts of the\nApostles, 84, 85.\nThe remnant church will be brought into great trial and distress. Those\nwho keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, will feel the\nire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan numbers the world as his subjects;\nhe has gained control of the apostate churches; but here is a little company\nthat are resisting his supremacy. If he could blot them from the earth, his\ntriumph would be complete. As he in\ufb02uenced the heathen nations to destroy\nIsrael, so in the near future he will stir up the wicked powers of earth to\ndestroy the people of God. All will be required to render obedience to human\nedicts in violation of the divine law. Those who will be true to God and\nto duty will be betrayed \u201cboth by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and\nfriends.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:231.\nThe time is not far distant when the test will come to every soul. The\nobservance of the false sabbath will be urged upon us. The contest will be\nbetween the commandments of God and the commandments of men. Those\nwho have yielded step by step to worldly demands, and conformed to worldly\ncustoms, will then yield to the powers that be, rather than subject themselves\nto derision, insult, threatened imprisonment, and death. At that time the gold\nwill be separated from the dross.... Many a star that we have admired for\nits brilliance will then go out in darkness. Those who have assumed the\nornaments of the sanctuary, but are not clothed with Christ\u2019s righteousness,\nwill then appear in the shame of their own nakedness.\u2014 Prophets and Kings,\n188.\nThere is a prospect before us of a continued struggle at the risk of\nimprisonment, loss of property, and even of life itself, to defend the law of\nGod, which is made void by the laws of men.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n5:712.\nThe time is hastening on when who stand in defense of the truth will know\nby experience what it means to be partakers in Christ\u2019s sufferings. The great\noppressor\n157\nsees that he has but a short time in which to work, that soon he will lose his\nhold upon man and his power be taken from him, and he is working with all\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish. Superstition and error\nare trampling upon truth, justice, and equity. Every power that is antagonistic\nto truth is strengthening.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, October 31, 1905.\nThe work which the church has failed to do in a time of peace and\nprosperity, she will have to do in a terrible crisis, under most discouraging,\nforbidding, circumstances. The warnings that worldly conformity has silenced\nor withheld, must be given under the \ufb01ercest opposition from enemies of the\nfaith. And at that time the super\ufb01cial, conservative class, whose in\ufb02uence\nhas steadily retarded the progress of the work, will renounce the faith, and\ntake their stand with its avowed enemies, toward whom their sympathies have\nlong been tending. These apostates will then manifest the most bitter enmity,\ndoing all in their power to oppress and malign their former brethren, and to\nexcite indignation against them. This day is just before us. The members\nof the church will individually be tested and proved. They will be placed\nin circumstances where they will be forced to bear witness for the truth.\nMany will be called to speak before councils and in courts of justice, perhaps\nseparately and alone. The experience which would have helped them in this\nemergency they have neglected to obtain, and their souls are burdened with\nremorse for wasted opportunities and neglected privileges.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:463.\nThe Protestant world today see in the little company keeping the Sabbath\na Mordecai in the gate. His character and conduct, expressing reverence for\nthe law of God, are a constant rebuke to those who have cast off the fear of the\nLord, and are trampling upon His Sabbath; the unwelcome intruder must by\nsome means be put out of the way.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:450.\nSatan will excite indignation against the humble minority who\nconscientiously refuse to accept popular customs and traditions. Men of\nposition and reputation will join with the lawless and the vile to take counsel\nagainst the people\n158\nof God. Wealth, genius, education, will combine to cover them with contempt.\nPersecuting rulers, ministers, and church members will conspire against\nthem. With voice and pen, by boasts, threats, and ridicule, they will seek\nto overthrow their faith. By false representations and angry appeals, they will\nstir up the passions of the people. Not having a \u201cThus saith the Scriptures\u201d to\nbring against the advocates of the Bible Sabbath, they will resort to oppressive\nenactments to supply the lack. To secure popularity and patronage, legislators\nwill yield to the demand for a Sunday law.... On this battle\ufb01eld comes the last\ngreat con\ufb02ict of the controversy between truth and error.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:450, 451.\nPersecution Essential\nWhen they were scattered by persecution, they went forth \ufb01lled with\nmissionary zeal. They realized the responsibility of their mission. They knew\nthat they held in their hands the bread of life for a famishing world; and they\nwere constrained by the love of Christ to break this bread to all who were in\nneed.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 106.\nGod means that testing truth shall be brought to the front, and become\na subject of examination and discussion, even if it is through the contempt\nplaced upon it. The minds of the people must be agitated. Every controversy,\nevery reproach, every slander, will be God\u2019s means of provoking inquiry, and\nawakening minds that otherwise would slumber.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n5:453.\nWhy Persecution Slumbers\nThe apostle Paul declares that \u201call that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall\nsuffer persecution.\u201d Why is it, then, that persecution seems in a great degree\nto slumber? The only reason is, that the church has conformed to the world\u2019s\nstandard, and therefore awakens no opposition. The religion which is current\nin our day is not of the pure and holy character that marked the Christian\nfaith in the days of Christ and His apostles. It is only because of the spirit\nof compromise with sin, because the great truths of the Word of God are so\nindifferently regarded, because there is so\n159\nlittle vital godliness in the church, that Christianity is apparently so popular\nwith the world. Let there be a revival of faith and power of the early church,\nand the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the \ufb01res of persecution will\nbe rekindled.\u2014 The Great Controversy, 48.\nThreefold Persecuting Union\nThrough the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday\nsacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions. While the former\nlays the foundation of Spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with\nRome. The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their\nhands across the gulf to grasp the hand of Spiritualism; they will reach over\nthe abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the in\ufb02uence of\nthis threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling\non the rights of conscience.\u2014 The Great Controversy, 588.\nThe Last Act in the Drama\nThe substitution of the laws of men for the law of God, the exaltation, by\nmerely human authority, of Sunday in place of the Bible Sabbath, is the last\nact in the drama. When this substitution becomes universal, God will reveal\nHimself. He will arise in His majesty to shake terribly the earth. He will come\nout of His place to punish the inhabitants of the world for their iniquity, and the\nearth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 7:141.\nWhen our nation shall so abjure the principles of its government as to\nenact a Sunday law, Protestantism will in this act join hands with popery; it\nwill be nothing else than giving life to the tyranny which has long been eagerly\nwatching its opportunity to spring again into active despotism.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 5:712.\nBy the decree of enforcing the institution of the Papacy in violation of\nthe law of God, our nation will disconnect herself fully from righteousness.\nWhen Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to grasp the hand of\nthe Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp\n160\nhands with Spiritualism, when, under the in\ufb02uence of this threefold union,\nour country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protestant\nand Republican government, and shall make provision for the propagation of\npapal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the time has come for\nthe marvelous working of Satan, and that the end is near.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:451.\nThe time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall be forced\nto seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places. As the siege of Jerusalem by\nthe Roman armies was the signal for \ufb02ight to the Judean Christians, so the\nassumption of power on the part of our nation, in the decree enforcing the\npapal sabbath, will be a warning to us. It will then be time to leave the large\ncities, preparatory to leaving the smaller ones for retired homes in secluded\nplaces among the mountains.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:464, 465.\nMany With Blinded Eyes\nThere are many, even of those engaged in this movement for Sunday\nenforcement, who are blinded to the results which will follow this action.\nThey do not see that they are striking directly against religious liberty. There\nare many who have never understood the claims of the Bible Sabbath, and the\nfalse foundation upon which the Sunday institution rests.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 5:711.\nResponsibilities and Duties of God\u2019s People\nThe banner of truth and religious liberty held aloft by the founders of\nthe gospel church and by God\u2019s witnesses during the centuries that have\npassed since then, has, in this last con\ufb02ict, been committed to our hands.\nThe responsibility for this great gift rests with those whom God has blessed\nwith a knowledge of His Word. We are to receive this Word as a supreme\nauthority. We are to recognize human government as an ordinance of divine\nappointment, and teach obedience to it as a sacred duty, within its legitimate\nsphere. But when its claims con\ufb02ict with the claims of God, we must obey\nGod rather than men. God\u2019s word must be recognized as above all human\nlegislation. A \u201cThus\n161\nsaith the Lord\u201d is not to be set aside for a \u201cThus saith the church\u201d or a \u201cThus\nsaith the state.\u201d The crown of Christ is to be lifted above the diadems of earthly\npotentates.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 68, 69.\nWe as a people have not accomplished the work which God has committed\nto us. We are not ready for the issue to which the enforcement of the Sunday\nlaw will bring us. It is our duty, as we see the signs of approaching peril,\nto arouse to action. Let none sit in calm expectation of the evil, comforting\nthemselves with the belief that this work must go on because prophecy has\nforetold it, and that the Lord will shelter his people. We are not doing the will\nof God if we sit in quietude, doing nothing to preserve liberty of conscience.\nFervent, effectual prayer should be ascending to heaven that this calamity\nmay be deferred until we can accomplish the work which has so long been\nneglected. Let there be more earnest prayer; and then let us work in harmony\nwith our prayers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:713, 714.\nIt is our duty to do all in our power to avert the threatened danger. We\nshould endeavor to disarm prejudice by placing ourselves in a proper light\nbefore the people. We should bring before them the real question at issue,\nthus interposing the most effectual protest against measures to restrict liberty\nof conscience.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:452.\nWhen God has given us light showing the dangers before us, how can we\nstand clear in His sight if we neglect to put forth every effort in our power\nto bring it before the people? Can we be content to leave them to meet this\nmomentous issue unwarned?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:712.\nWhen the National Reformers began to urge measures to restrict religious\nliberty, our leading men should have been alive to the situation, and should\nhave labored earnestly to counteract these efforts. It is not in the order of God\nthat light has been kept from our people,\u2014the very present truth which they\nneeded for this time. Not all our ministers who are giving the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, really understand what constitutes that message. The National\nReform movement has been regarded by some as of so little\n162\nimportance that they have not thought it is necessary to give much attention to\nit, and have even felt that in so doing they would be giving time to questions\ndistinct from the third angel\u2019s message. May the Lord forgive our brethren for\nthus interpreting the very message for this time.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n5:715.\nWe have been looking many years for a Sunday law to be enacted in our\nland; and now that the movement is right upon us, we ask, Will our people do\ntheir duty in the matter? Can we not assist in lifting the standard, and in calling\nto the front those who have a regard for their religious rights and privileges?\nThe time is fast approaching when those who choose to obey God rather than\nman, will be made to feel the hand of oppression. Shall we then dishonor\nGod by keeping silent while His holy commandments are trodden under foot?\nWhile the Protestant world is by her attitude making concessions to Rome,\nlet us arouse to comprehend the situation, and view the contest before us\nin its true bearings. Let the watchmen now lift up their voice, and give the\nmessage which is present truth for this time. Let us show people where we\nare in prophetic history, and seek to arouse the spirit of true Protestantism,\nawakening the world to a sense of the value of the privileges of religious liberty\nso long enjoyed.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:716.\nThe people of our land need to be aroused to resist the advances of this\nmost dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty.\u2014 The Spirit of Prophecy\n4:382.\nShall we sit with folded hands, and do nothing in this crisis? ... God help\nus to arouse from the stupor that has hung over us for years.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, December 18, 1888.\nA Wise Course to Pursue\nTo defy the Sunday laws will but strengthen in their persecution the\nreligious zealots who are seeking to enforce them. Give them no occasion\nto call you law-breakers. If they are left to rein up men who fear neither God\nnor man, the reining up will soon lose its novelty for them, and they\n163\nwill see that it is not consistent nor convenient for them to be strict in\nregard to the observance of Sunday. Keep right on with your missionary\nwork, with your Bibles in your hands, and the enemy will see that he has\nworsted his own cause. One does not receive the mark of the beast because\nhe shows that he realizes the wisdom of keeping the peace by refraining\nfrom work that gives offense, doing at the same time a work of the highest\nimportance.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:232.\nWhen we devote Sunday to missionary work, the whip will be taken\nout of the hands of the arbitrary zealots who would be well pleased to\nhumiliate Seventh-day Adventists. When they see that we employ ourselves\non Sunday in visiting the people and opening the Scriptures to them, they will\nknow that is useless for them to try to hinder our work by making Sunday\nlaws.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:232, 233.\nSunday can be used for carrying forward various lines of work that will\naccomplish much for the Lord. On this day open-air meetings and cottage\nmeetings can be held. House-to-house work can be done. Those who write can\ndevote this day to writing their articles. Whenever it is possible, let religious\nservices be held on Sunday. Make these meetings intensely interesting. Sing\ngenuine revival hymns, and speak with power and assurance of the Saviour\u2019s\nlove. Speak on temperance and on true religious experience.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:233.\nLet the teachers in our schools devote Sunday to missionary effort. I was\ninstructed that they would thus be able to defeat the purposes of the enemy.\nLet the teachers take the students with them to hold meetings for those who\nknow not the truth. Thus they will accomplish much more that they could in\nany other way.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:233.\nThe Triumph of Truth\nSkepticism may treat the claims of God\u2019s law with jest, scof\ufb01ng, and\ndenial. The spirit of worldliness may contaminate the many and control the\nfew; the cause of God may hold its ground only by great exertion and continual\nsacri\ufb01ce;\n164\nyet in the end of the truth will triumph gloriously.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 186.\nIn the closing work of God in the earth, the standard of His law will be\nagain exalted. False religion may prevail, iniquity may abound, the love of\nmany may wax cold, the cross of Calvary may be lost sight of, and darkness,\nlike the pall of death, may spread over the world; the whole force of the\npopular current may be turned against the truth; plot after plot may be formed\nto overthrow the people of God; but in the hour of greatest peril, the God\nof Elijah will raise up human instrumentalities to bear a message that will\nnot be silenced. In the populous cities of the land, and in the places where\nmen have gone to the greatest lengths in speaking against the Most High, the\nvoice of stern rebuke will be heard. Boldly will men of God\u2019s appointment\ndenounce the union of the church with the world. Earnestly will they call\nupon men and women to turn from the observance of a man-made institution\nto the observance of the true Sabbath.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 186, 187.\nLight in the Darkness\nAmong earth\u2019s inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those who\nhave not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear only\nat night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the earth and\ngross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic lands of Europe\nand of South America, in China, in India, in the islands of the sea, and in all\nthe dark corners of the earth, God has in reserve a \ufb01rmament of chosen ones\nthat will yet shine forth amidst the darkness revealing clearly to an apostate\nworld the transforming power of obedience to His law. Even now they are\nappearing in every nation, among every tongue and people; and in the hour\nof deepest apostasy, when Satan\u2019s supreme effort is made to cause \u201call, both\nsmall and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to receive, under penalty of\ndeath, the sign of allegiance to a false rest day, these faithful ones, \u201cblameless\nand harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke,\u201d will \u201cshine\n165\nas lights in the world.\u201d The darker the night, the more brilliantly will they\nshine.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 188, 189.\nWhen the storm of persecution really breaks upon us, the true sheep will\nhear the true Shepherd\u2019s voice. Self-denying efforts will be put forth to save\nthe lost, and many who have strayed from the fold will come back to follow\nthe great Shepherd.\u2014Australian The Signs of the Times , January 26, 1903,\nSupplement.\nThe Divine Protection\nBut though the con\ufb02ict is a ceaseless one, none are left to struggle alone.\nAngels help and protect those who walk humbly before God. Never will our\nLord betray one who trusts in Him. As His children draw near to Him for\nprotection from evil, in pity and love He lifts up for them a standard against\nthe enemy. Touch them not, He says; for they are Mine. I have graven them\nupon the palms of My hands.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 571.\nHeaven is very near those who suffer for righteousness\u2019 sake. Christ\nidenti\ufb01es His interests with the interests of His faithful people; He suffers\nin the person of His saints; and whoever touches His chosen ones, touches\nHim. The power that is near to deliver from physical harm or distress, is also\nnear to save from the greater evil, making it possible for the servant of God to\nmaintain his integrity under all circumstances.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 545.\nAt times the Lord may seem to have forgotten the perils of His church, and\nthe injury done her by her enemies. But God has not forgotten. Nothing in this\nworld is so dear to the heart of God as His church. It is not His will that worldly\npolicy shall corrupt her record. He does not leave His people to be overcome\nby Satan\u2019s temptations. He will punish those who misrepresent Him, but He\nwill be gracious to all who sincerely repent.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 590.\n166\nChap. 15 - Harvest Ingathering\nThe Perplexing Problem\nFor years the perplexing question has been before us, How can we raise\nfunds adequate for the support of the missions which the Lord has gone before\nus to open? We read the plain commands of the gospel; and the missions, in\nboth home and foreign \ufb01elds, present their necessities. The indications, yea,\nthe positive revelations of Providence unite in urging us to do quickly the work\nthat is waiting to be done.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:114.\nA Successful Plan\nOne of the new plans for reaching unbelievers is the Harvest Ingathering\ncampaign for missions. In many places during the past few years, this has\nproved a success, bringing blessing to many, and increasing the \ufb02ow of\nmeans into the mission treasury. As those not of our faith have been made\nacquainted with the progress of the third angel\u2019s message in heathen lands,\ntheir sympathies have been aroused, and some have sought to learn more of\nthe truth that has such power to transform hearts and lives. Men and women of\nall classes have been reached, and the name of God has been glori\ufb01ed.\u2014MS.,\n\u201cConsecrated Efforts to Reach Unbelievers,\u201d June 5, 1914.\nSome may question the propriety of receiving gifts from unbelievers. Let\nsuch ask themselves: \u201cWho is the real owner of our world? To whom belong\nits houses and lands, and its treasures of gold and silver?\u201d God has an\nabundance in our world, and He has placed His goods in the hands of all,\nboth the obedient and the disobedient. He is ready to move upon the hearts\nof worldly men, even idolaters, to give of their abundance for the support of\nHis work; and He will do this as soon as His people learn to approach these\nmen wisely and to call their attention to that which it is their privilege to do. If\nthe needs of the Lord\u2019s work were set forth in a proper light before those who\nhave means and in\ufb02uence, these men might do much to advance\n167\nthe cause of present truth. God\u2019s people have lost many privileges of which\nthey could have taken advantage, had they not chosen to stand independent of\nthe world.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\nThe Lord still moves upon the hearts of kings and rulers in behalf of His\npeople. Those who are laboring for Him are to avail themselves of the help\nthat He prompts men to give for the advancement of His cause. The agents\nthrough whom these gifts come, may open ways by which the light of truth\nshall be given to many benighted lands. These men may have no sympathy\nwith God\u2019s work, no faith in Christ, no acquaintance with His word; but their\ngifts are not on this account to be refused.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March\n15, 1904.\nThe Lord has placed His goods in the hands of unbelievers as well as\nbelievers; all may return to Him His own for the doing of the work that must\nbe done for a fallen world. As long as we are in this world, as long as the Spirit\nof God strives with the children of men, so long are we to receive favors as well\nas to impart them. We are to give to the world the light of truth, as revealed\nin the Scriptures; and we are to receive from the world that which God moves\nupon them to give in behalf of His cause.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March\n15, 1904.\nAlthough now almost wholly in the possession of wicked men, all the\nworld, with its riches and treasures, belongs to God. \u201cThe earth is the Lord\u2019s,\nand the fulness thereof.\u201d \u201cThe silver is Mine, and the gold is Mine, saith\nthe Lord of hosts.\u201d \u201cEvery beast of the forest is Mine, and the cattle upon\na thousand hills. I know all the birds of the mountains; and the wild beasts\nof the \ufb01eld are Mine. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world\nis Mine, and the fulness thereof.\u201d O that Christians might realize more and\nstill more fully that it is their privilege and their duty, while cherishing right\nprinciples, to take advantage of every heaven-sent opportunity for advancing\nGod\u2019s kingdom in this world.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\n168\nAdmonition to Workers\nTo all who are about to take up special missionary work with the paper\nprepared for use in the Harvest Ingathering campaign, I would say: Be diligent\nin your efforts; live under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Add daily to\nyour Christian experience. Let those who have special aptitude, work for\nunbelievers in the high places as well as in the low places of life. Search\ndiligently for perishing souls. Oh, think of the yearning desire Christ has to\nbring to His fold again those who have gone astray! Watch for souls as they\nthat must give an account. In your church and neighborhood missionary work,\nlet your light shine forth in such clear, steady rays that no man can stand up in\nthe judgment, and say, \u201cWhy did you not tell me about this truth? Why did you\nnot care for my soul?\u201d Then let us be diligent in the distribution of literature\nthat has been carefully prepared for use among those not of our faith. Let us\nmake the most of every opportunity to arrest the attention of unbelievers. Let\nus put literature into every hand that will receive it. Let us consecrate ourselves\nto the proclamation of the message, \u201cPrepare ye the way of the Lord, make\nstraight in the desert a highway for our God.\u201d\u2014MS., \u201cConsecrated Efforts to\nReach Unbelievers,\u201d June 5, 1914.\nEssentials to Success\nIn following any plan that may be set in operation for carrying to others a\nknowledge of present truth, and of the marvelous providences connected with\nthe advancing cause, let us \ufb01rst consecrate ourselves fully to Him whose name\nwe wish to exalt. Let us also pray earnestly in behalf of those whom we expect\nto visit, by living faith bringing them, one by one, into the presence of God.\nThe Lord knows the thought and purposes of man, and how easily He can melt\nus! How His Spirit, like a \ufb01re, can subdue the \ufb02inty heart! How He can \ufb01ll\nthe soul with love and tenderness! How He can give us the graces of His Holy\nSpirit, and \ufb01t us to go in and out, in laboring for souls!\u2014MS., \u201cConsecrated\nEfforts to Reach Unbelievers,\u201d June 5, 1914.\n169\nThe Lord\u2019s work might receive far greater favors than it is now receiving,\nif we would approach men in wisdom, acquainting them with the work, and\ngiving them an opportunity of doing that which it is our privilege to induce\nthem to do for its advancement. If we, as God\u2019s servants, would take a wise\nand prudent course, His good hand would prosper us in our efforts.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\nIf all who are engaged in the Lord\u2019s work would realize how much depends\nupon their \ufb01delity and wise forethought, far greater prosperity would attend\ntheir efforts. Through dif\ufb01dence and backwardness we often fail of securing\nthat which is attainable as a right, from the powers that be. God will work for\nus, when we are ready to do what we can and should do on our part.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\nHome Missions vs. Foreign Missions\nThe home missionary work will be farther advanced in every way when\na more liberal, self-denying, self-sacri\ufb01cing spirit is manifested for the\nprosperity of foreign missions; for the prosperity of the home work depends\nlargely, under God, upon the re\ufb02ex in\ufb02uence of the evangelical work done\nin countries afar off. It is in working actively to supply the necessities of\nthe cause of God that we bring our souls in touch with the Source of all\npower.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:27\nAn American business man, who was an earnest Christian, in conversation\nwith a fellow worker, remarked that he himself worked for Christ twenty-four\nhours of the day. \u201cIn all my business relations,\u201d he said, \u201cI try to represent\nmy Master. As I have opportunity, I try to win others to Him. All day I am\nworking for Christ. And at night, while I sleep, I have a man working for Him\nin China.\u201d In explanation, He added: \u201cIn my youth I determined to go as a\nmissionary to the heathen. But on the death of my father I had to take up his\nbusiness in order to provide for the family. Now, instead of going myself, I\nsupport a missionary. In such a town of such a province of China, my\n170\nworker is stationed. And so, even while I sleep, I am, through my\nrepresentative, still working for Christ.\u201d\nAre there not Seventh-day Adventists who will do likewise? Instead of\nkeeping the ministers at work for the churches that already know the truth, let\nthe members of the churches say to these laborers: \u201cGo work for souls that\nare perishing in darkness. We ourselves will carry forward the services of the\nchurch. We will keep up the meetings, and, by abiding in Christ, will maintain\nspiritual life. We will work for souls that are about us, and we will send\nour prayers and our gifts to sustain the laborers in more needy and destitute\n\ufb01elds.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:29, 30.\nA Worthy Example\nThe poor widow who cast her two mites into the Lord\u2019s treasury, little\nknew what she was doing. Her example of self-sacri\ufb01ce has acted and reacted\nupon thousands of hearts in every land and in every age. It has brought to the\ntreasury of God gifts from the high and the low, the rich and the poor. It has\nhelped to sustain missions, to establish hospitals, to feed the hungry, clothe\nthe naked, heal the sick, and preach the gospel to the poor. Multitudes have\nbeen blessed through her unsel\ufb01sh deed.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:310.\nLessons from the Life of Nehemiah\nIn years past, I have spoken in favor of the plan of presenting our mission\nwork and its progress before our friends and neighbors, and have referred to\nthe example of Nehemiah. And now I desire to urge our brethren and sisters to\nstudy anew the experience of this man of prayer and faith and sound judgment,\nwho made bold to ask his friend, King Artaxerxes, for help with which to\nadvance the interests of God\u2019s cause.\u2014MS., \u201cConsecrated Efforts to Reach\nUnbelievers,\u201d June 5, 1914.\nSolicited Means From Those Able to Bestow \u2014Men of prayer should be\nmen of action. Those who are ready and willing, will \ufb01nd ways and means\nof working. Nehemiah did not depend upon uncertainties. The means which\nhe lacked he solicited from those who were able to bestow.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, March 15, 1904.\n171\nCourage for the Task Came Through Power \u2014Nehemiah and Artaxerxes\nstood face to face,\u2014the one a servant of a downtrodden race, the other the\nmonarch of the world\u2019s great empire. But in\ufb01nitely greater than the disparity\nof rank was the moral distance which separated them. Nehemiah had complied\nwith the invitation of the King of kings, \u201cLet him take hold of My strength,\nthat he may make peace with Me, and he shall make peace with Me.\u201d The\nsilent petition that he sent up to heaven was the same that he had offered for\nmany weeks, that God would prosper his request. And now, taking courage at\nthe thought that he had a Friend, omniscient and omnipotent, to work in his\nbehalf, the man of God made known to the king his desire for release for a time\nfrom his of\ufb01ce at the court, and for authority to build up the waste places of\nJerusalem, and make it once more a strong and defensed city. Momentous\nresults to the Jewish city and nation hung upon this request. \u201cAnd,\u201d says\nNehemiah, \u201cthe king granted me according to the good hand of my God upon\nme.\u201d\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 8, 1904.\nSecured Of\ufb01cial Indorsement \u2014As his [Nehemiah\u2019s] request to the king\nhad been so favorably received, he was encouraged to ask for such assistance\nas was needed for the carrying out of his plans. To give dignity and authority\nto his mission, as well as to provide for protection on the journey, he secured\na military escort. He obtained royal letters to the governors of the provinces\nbeyond the Euphrates, the territory through which he must pass on his way\nto Judea; and he obtained, also, a letter to the keeper of the king\u2019s forest in\nthe mountains of Lebanon, directing him to furnish such timber as would be\nneeded for the wall of Jerusalem and the buildings that Nehemiah proposed\nto erect. In order that there might be no occasion for complaint that he had\nexceeded his commission, Nehemiah was careful to have the authority and\nprivileges accorded him, clearly de\ufb01ned.\u2014 The Southern Watchman , March\n15, 1904.\nThe royal letters to the governors of the provinces along his route, secured\nto Nehemiah an honorable reception and prompt assistance. And no enemy\ndared molest the of\ufb01cial who was guarded by the power of the Persian king\nand\n172\ntreated with marked consideration by the provincial rulers. Nehemiah\u2019s\njourney was safe and prosperous.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 22, 1904.\nEncountering Obstacles \u2014His arrival at Jerusalem, however, with the\nattendance of a military guard, showing that he had come on some important\nmission, excited the jealousy and hatred of the enemies of Israel. The heathen\ntribes settled near Jerusalem had previously indulged their enmity against the\nJews by heaping upon them every insult and injury which they dared in\ufb02ict.\nForemost in this evil work were certain chiefs of these tribes, Sanballat the\nHoronite, Tobiah the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian; and from this\ntime these leaders watched with jealous eye the movements of Nehemiah, and\nendeavored by every means in their power to thwart his plans and hinder his\nwork.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 22, 1904.\nThey attempted to cause division among the workmen by suggesting\ndoubts and arousing unbelief as to their success. They also ridiculed the\nefforts of the builders, declared the enterprise an impossibility, and predicted a\ndisgraceful failure.... The builders on the wall were soon beset by more active\nopposition. They were compelled to guard continually against the plots of\ntheir sleepless adversaries. The emissaries of the enemy endeavored to destroy\ntheir courage by the circulation of false reports; conspiracies were formed on\nvarious pretexts to draw Nehemiah into their toils; and false-hearted Jews were\nfound ready to aid the treacherous undertaking.... Emissaries of the enemy,\nprofessing friendliness, mingled with the builders, suggesting changes in the\nplan, seeking in various ways to divert the attention of the workers, to cause\nconfusion and perplexity, and to arouse distrust and suspicion.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, April 12, 1904.\nSame Obstacles Confront Leaders Today\u2014The experience of Nehemiah is\nrepeated in the history of God\u2019s people in this time. Those who labor in the\ncause of truth will \ufb01nd that they cannot do this without exciting the anger of\nits enemies. Though they have been called of God to the work in which they\nare engaged, and their course is approved of Him, they cannot escape reproach\nand derision. They\n173\nwill be denounced as visionary, unreliable, scheming, hypocritical,\u2014anything,\nin short, that will suit the purpose of their enemies. The most sacred things\nwill be represented in a ridiculous light to amuse the ungodly. A very small\namount of sarcasm and low wit, united with envy, jealousy, impiety, and\nhatred, is suf\ufb01cient to excite the mirth of the profane scoffer. And these\npresumptuous jesters sharpen one another\u2019s ingenuity, and embolden each\nother in their blasphemous work. Contempt and derision are indeed painful\nto human nature; but they must be endured by all who are true to God. It is\nthe policy of Satan thus to turn souls from doing the work which the Lord has\nlaid upon them.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 12, 1904.\nRallying the Dispirited Forces \u2014In secrecy and silence, Nehemiah\ncompleted his circuit of the walls. He declares, \u201cThe rulers knew not whither\nI went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests,\nnor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.\u201d In this\npainful survey he did not wish to attract the attention of either friends or foes,\nlest an excitement should be created, and reports be put in circulation that\nmight defeat, or at least hinder, his work. Nehemiah devoted the remainder\nof the night to prayer; in the morning there must be earnest effort to arouse\nand unite his dispirited and divided countrymen.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nMarch 22, 1904.\nAlthough Nehemiah bore a royal commission requiring the inhabitants to\nco-operate with him in rebuilding the walls of the city, he chose not to depend\nupon the mere exercise of authority. He sought rather to gain the con\ufb01dence\nand sympathy of the people, well knowing that a union of hearts as well as\nhands was essential to success in the great work which he had undertaken.\nWhen he called the people together on the morrow, he presented such\narguments as were calculated to arouse their dormant energies and to unite\ntheir scattered numbers.... And having laid the matter fully before them,\nshowing that he was sustained by the combined authority of the Persian king\nand the God of Israel, Nehemiah put to the people\n174\ndirectly the question whether they would take advantage of this favorable\noccasion, and arise with him and build the wall. This appeal went straight\nto their hearts; the manifestation of the favor of Heaven toward them put their\nfears to shame. With new courage they cried out with one voice, \u201cLet us rise\nup and build.\u201d\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 29, 1904.\nThe holy energy and high hope of Nehemiah were communicated to the\npeople. As they caught the spirit, they rose for a time to the moral level\nof their leader. Each, in his own sphere, was a sort of Nehemiah; and each\nstrengthened and upheld his brother in the work.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nMarch 29, 1904.\nThe Priests of Israel Among the First to Respond \u2014Among the \ufb01rst to\ncatch Nehemiah\u2019s spirit of zeal and earnestness were the priests of Israel.\nFrom the position of in\ufb02uence which they occupied, these men could do much\nto hinder or advance the work. Their ready co-operation at the very outset\ncontributed not a little to its success. Thus should it be in every holy enterprise.\nThose who occupy positions of in\ufb02uence and responsibility in the church,\nshould be foremost in the work of God. If they move reluctantly, others will\nnot move at all. But \u201ctheir zeal will provoke very many.\u201d When their light\nburns brightly, a thousand torches will be kindled at the \ufb02ame.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, April 5, 1904.\nNehemiah as an Organizer \u2014The people in general were animated with\none heart and one soul of patriotism and cheerful activity. Men of ability and\nin\ufb02uence organized the various classes of citizens into companies, each leader\nmaking himself responsible for the erection of a certain portion of the wall. It\nwas a sight well pleasing to God and angels to see the busy companies working\nharmoniously upon the broken-down walls of Jerusalem, and it was a joyous\nsound to hear the noise of instruments of labor from the earliest dawn \u201ctill the\nstars appeared.\u201d\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 5, 1904.\nThe Demonstration of True Leadership\u2014Nehemiah\u2019s zeal and energy did\nnot abate, now that the work was\n175\nactually begun. He did not fold his hands, feeling that he might let fall\nthe burden. With tireless vigilance he constantly superintended the work,\ndirecting the workmen, noting every hindrance, and providing for every\nemergency. His in\ufb02uence was constantly felt along the whole extent of those\nthree miles of wall. With timely words he encouraged the fearful, approved\nthe diligent, or aroused the laggard. And again he watched with eagle eye\nthe movements of their enemies, who at times collected at a distance and\nengaged in earnest conversation, as if plotting mischief, and then drawing near\nthe workmen, attempted to divert their attention and hinder the work.\nWhile the eye of every worker is often directed to Nehemiah, ready to heed\nthe slightest signal, his eye and heart are uplifted to God, the great Overseer of\nthe whole work, the one who put it into the heart of His servant to build. And\nas faith and courage strengthen in his own heart, Nehemiah exclaims, and his\nwords, repeated and re-echoed, thrill the hearts of the workers all along the\nline, \u201cThe God of heaven, He will prosper us!\u201d\u2014 The Southern Watchman ,\nApril 5, 1904.\nNehemiah and his companions did not shrink from hardships, or excuse\nthemselves from trying service. Neither by night nor by day, not even during\nthe brief time given to slumber, did they put off their clothing, or even lay\naside their armor. \u201cSo neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the\nmen of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving\nthat every one put them off for washing.\u201d\u2014The Southern Watchman, April 26,\n1904.\nCounteracting In\ufb02uence in Every Religious Movement\u2014A majority of the\nnobles and rulers of Israel also came nobly up to their duty; but there were a\nfew, the Tekoite nobles, who \u201cput not their necks to the work of their Lord.\u201d\nWhile the faithful builders have honorable mention in the book of God, the\nmemory of these slothful servants is branded with shame, and handed down\nas a warning to all future generations.\nIn every religious movement there are some who, while they cannot deny\nthat it is the work of God, will keep\n176\nthemselves aloof, refusing to make any effort to advance it. But in enterprises\nto promote their sel\ufb01sh interests, these men are often the most active and\nenergetic workers. It were well to remember that record kept on high, the\nbook of God, in which all our motives and our works are written,\u2014that book\nin which there are no omissions, no mistakes, and out of which we are to\nbe judged. There every neglected opportunity to do service for God will be\nfaithfully reported, and every deed of faith and love, however humble, will be\nheld in everlasting remembrance.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 5, 1904.\nThe Call for Modern Nehemiahs\nThere is need of Nehemiahs in the church today,\u2014not men who can\npray and preach only, but men whose prayers and sermons are braced with\n\ufb01rm and eager purpose. The course pursued by this Hebrew patriot in the\naccomplishment of his plans is one that should still be adopted by ministers\nand leading men. When they have laid their plans, they should present them\nto the church in such a manner as to win their interest and co-operation. Let\nthe people understand the plans and share in the work, and they will have a\npersonal interest in its prosperity. The success attending Nehemiah\u2019s efforts\nshows what prayer, faith, and wise, energetic action will accomplish. Living\nfaith will prompt to energetic action. The spirit manifested by the leader will\nbe, to a great extent, re\ufb02ected by the people. If the leaders professing to\nbelieve the solemn, important truths that are to test the world at this time,\nmanifest no ardent zeal to prepare a people to stand in the day of God, we\nmust expect the church to be careless, indolent, and pleasure-loving.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, March 29, 1904.\n177\nChap. 16 - The Church Expansion\nMovement\nThe Divine Plan\nIt is not the purpose of God that His people should colonize, or settle\ntogether in large communities. The disciples of Christ are His representatives\nupon the earth, and God designs that they shall be scattered all over the\ncountry, in the towns, cities, and villages, as lights amidst the darkness of\nthe world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:244.\nThe plan of colonizing, or moving from different localities where there\nis but little strength or in\ufb02uence, and concentrating the in\ufb02uence of many\nin one locality, is removing the light from places where God would have it\nshine.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:633.\nIf the church of Christ were ful\ufb01lling the purpose of our Lord, light\nwould be shed upon all that sit in darkness and in the region and shadow\nof death. Instead of congregating together and shunning responsibility and\ncross-bearing, the members of the church would scatter into all lands, letting\nthe light of Christ shine out from them, working as He did for the salvation of\nsouls, and this \u201cgospel of the kingdom\u201d would speedily be carried to all the\nworld.\u2014 Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 42, 43.\nBrethren and sisters, why hover about the churches? Study the parable of\nthe lost sheep, and go forth as true shepherds, seeking the lost one who is in the\nwilderness of sin. Rescue the perishing.\u2014 The Review and Herald, December\n12, 1893.\nThe lay members of our churches can accomplish a work which, as yet,\nthey have scarcely begun. None should move into new places merely for\nthe sake of worldly advantage; but where there is an opening to obtain a\nlivelihood, let families that are well grounded in the truth enter, one or two\nfamilies in a place, to work as missionaries. They should feel a love for souls,\na burden of labor for them, and should make it a study how to bring them into\nthe truth. They can distribute our publications, hold meetings in\n178\ntheir homes, become acquainted with their neighbors, and invite them to\ncome to these meetings. Thus they can let their light shine in good\nworks.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:245.\nBrethren who wish to change their location, who have the glory of God\nin view, and feel that individual responsibility rests upon them to do others\ngood, to bene\ufb01t and save souls for whom Christ withheld not His precious\nlife, should move into towns and villages where there is but little or no light,\nand where they can be of real service, and bless others with their labor and\nexperience. Missionaries are wanted to go into towns and villages and raise\nthe standard of truth, that God may have His witnesses scattered all over the\nland, that the light of truth may penetrate where it has not yet reached, and\nthe standard of truth be raised where it is not yet known.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:115.\nNothing will so arouse a self-sacri\ufb01cing zeal and broaden and strengthen\nthe character as to engage in work for others. Many professed Christians, in\nseeking church relationship, think only of themselves. They wish to enjoy\nchurch fellowship and pastoral care. They become members of large and\nprosperous churches, and are content to do little for others. In this way they\nare robbing themselves of the most precious blessings. Many would be greatly\nbene\ufb01ted by sacri\ufb01cing their pleasant, ease-conducing associations. They\nneed to go where their energies will be called out in Christian work, and they\ncan learn to bear responsibilities.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 151.\nThere are thousands of places to be entered where the standard of truth has\nnever been raised, where the proclamation of the truth has never been heard\nin America. And there are thousands who might enter the harvest \ufb01eld who\nare now religiously idle, and as a result, go crippling their way to heaven,\nexpressing their doubt whether they are Christians. Their need is a vital union\nwith Jesus Christ. Then it can be said of them, \u201cYe are laborers together with\nGod.\u201d I want to say to many, You are waiting for some one to carry you to the\nvineyard and set you to work, or to bring the vineyard to you, that you may\nexperience no\n179\ninconvenience in labor. You will wait in vain. If you will lift up your eyes,\nyou will see the harvest ripe, ready for the sickle, whichever way you may\nlook; you will \ufb01nd work close by and far off. But of how many will Christ say\nin the judgment, \u201cGood and faithful servants\u201d? I think how the angels must\nfeel seeing the end approaching, and those who claim to have a knowledge\nof God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent, huddle together, colonize, and\nattend the meetings, and feel dissatis\ufb01ed if there is not much preaching to\nbene\ufb01t their souls and strengthen the church, while they are doing literally\nnothing.... If their temporal, \ufb01nancial prospects are not as prosperous by\nmoving to localities where the truth has not been proclaimed, or where there\nhas been but a glimmering of light, will they not be doing just the work that\nJesus has done to save them?\u2014 The General Conference Bulletin, 1893, 131.\nWe see the great need of missionary work to carry the truth not only to\nforeign countries, but to those who are near us. Close around us are cities and\ntowns in which no efforts are made to save souls. Why should not families\nwho know the present truth settle in these cities and villages, to set up there\nthe standard of Christ, working in humility, not in their own way, but in God\u2019s\nway, to bring the light before those who have no knowledge of it?\nWhen the church shall truly have the spirit of the message, they will throw\nall their energies into the work of saving the souls for whom Christ has died.\nThey will enter new \ufb01elds. Some who are not ordained ministers will be\nlaborers together with God in visiting the churches, and trying to strengthen\nthe things that remain, that are ready to die. There will be laymen who will\nmove into towns and cities, and into apparently out-of-the-way places, that\nthey may let the light which God has given them, shine forth to others. Some\nwhom they meet will not appear to be the most promising subjects, but the\nonly question should be, Will they come into harmony with Christ? Will they\nbecome partakers of His spirit, so that their in\ufb02uence, in precept and example,\nwill present the attractions of the Author of truth and righteousness?\n180\nIn places where the truth is not known, brethren who are adapted to the\nwork, might hire a hall, or some other suitable place to assemble, and gather\ntogether all who will come. Then let them instruct the people in the truth.\nThey need not sermonize, but take the Bible, and let God speak directly out\nof His Word. If there is only a small number present, they can read a \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord,\u201d without a great parade or excitement; just read and explain the\nsimple gospel truth, and sing and pray with them.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nSeptember 29, 1891.\nAbraham a Worthy Example\nIt was no light test that was thus brought upon Abraham, no small sacri\ufb01ce\nthat was required of him. There were strong ties to bind him to his country,\nhis kindred, and his home. But he did not hesitate to obey the call. He had no\nquestion to ask concerning the Land of Promise,\u2014whether the soil was fertile,\nand the climate healthful; whether the country offered agreeable surroundings,\nand would afford opportunities for amassing wealth. God had spoken, and His\nservant must obey; the happiest place on earth for him was the place where\nGod would have him to be.\nMany are still tested as was Abraham. They do not hear the voice of God\nspeaking directly from the heavens, but He calls them by the teachings of His\nWord and the events of this providence. They may be required to abandon\na career that promises wealth and honor, to leave congenial and pro\ufb01table\nassociations, and separate from kindred, to enter upon what appears to be only\na path of self-denial, hardship, and sacri\ufb01ce. God has a work for them to do;\nbut a life of ease and the in\ufb02uence of friends and kindred would hinder the\ndevelopment of the very traits essential for its accomplishment. He calls them\naway from human in\ufb02uences and aid, and leads them to feel the need of His\nhelp, and to depend upon Him alone, that He may reveal Himself to them.\nWho is ready at the call of Providence to renounce cherished plans and\nfamiliar associations? Who will accept new duties and enter untried \ufb01elds,\ndoing God\u2019s work with \ufb01rm and willing hearts, for Christ\u2019s sake counting His\nlosses again? He who will do this has the faith of Abraham,\n181\nand will share with him that \u201cfar more exceeding and eternal weight of\nglory,\u201d with which \u201cthe sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be\ncompared.\u201d\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 126, 127.\nWhat Doest Thou Here?\nMuch depends on the unceasing activity of those who are true and loyal;\nand for this reason Satan puts forth every possible effort to thwart the divine\npurpose to be wrought out through the obedient. He causes some to lose sight\nof their high and holy mission, and to become satis\ufb01ed with the pleasures of\nthis life. He leads them to settle down at ease, or, for the sake of greater\nworldly advantages, to remove from places where they might be a power\nfor good. Others he causes to \ufb02ee in discouragement from duty, because of\nopposition or persecution. But all such are regarded by Heaven with tenderest\npity. To every child of God whose voice the enemy of souls had succeeded in\nsilencing, the question is addressed, \u201cWhat doest thou here?\u201d I commissioned\nyou to go into all the world and preach the gospel, to prepare a people for the\nday of God. Why are you here? Who sent you?\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 171,\n172.\nOf families, as of individuals, the question is asked, \u201cWhat doest thou\nhere?\u201d In many churches there are families well instructed in the truths of\nGod\u2019s Word, who might widen the sphere of their in\ufb02uence by moving to\nplaces in need of the ministry they are capable of giving.\u2014 Prophets and\nKings, 172.\nThe Call to Christian Families\nMissionary families are needed to settle in the waste places. Let farmers,\n\ufb01nanciers, builders, and those who are skilled in various arts and crafts, go to\nneglected \ufb01elds, to improve the land, to establish industries, to prepare humble\nhomes for themselves, and to help their neighbors.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing,\n194.\nGod calls for Christian families to go into communities that are in darkness\nand error, and work wisely and perseveringly for the Master. To answer this\ncall requires self-sacri\ufb01ce. While many are waiting to have every obstacle\n182\nremoved, souls are dying without hope and without God in the world.\nMany, very many, for the sake of worldly advantage, for the sake of\nacquiring scienti\ufb01c knowledge, will venture into pestilential regions, and\nendure hardship and privation. Where are those who are willing to do this\nfor the sake of telling others of the Saviour? Where are the men and women\nwho will move into regions that are in need of the gospel, that they may point\nthose in darkness to the Redeemer?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:33.\nThere are whole families who might be missionaries, engaging in personal\nlabor, toiling for the Master with busy hands and active brains, devising new\nmethods for the success of His work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:40.\nIf families would locate in the dark places of the earth, places where the\npeople are enshrouded in spiritual gloom, and let the light of Christ\u2019s life shine\nout through them, a great work might be accomplished. Let them begin their\nwork in a quiet, unobtrusive way, not drawing on the funds of the conference\nuntil the interest becomes so extensive that they cannot manage it without\nministerial help.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:442.\nTransplanting Requires Wise Nurserymen\nPrepare workers to go out into the highways and hedges. We need wise\nnurserymen who will transplant trees to different localities, and give them\nadvantages, that they may grow. It is the positive duty of God\u2019s people to go\ninto the regions beyond. Let forces be set at work to clear new ground, to\nestablish new centers of in\ufb02uence wherever an opening can be found. Rally\nworkers who possess true missionary zeal, and let them go forth to diffuse\nlight and knowledge far and near.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:118.\nMany of the members of our large churches are doing comparatively\nnothing. They might accomplish a good work if, instead of crowding together,\nthey would scatter into places that have not yet been entered by the truth.\nTrees that are planted too thickly do not \ufb02ourish. They are transplanted by\nthe gardener, that they may have room to grow, and not become dwarfed and\nsickly. The same rule\n183\nwould work well for our large churches. Many of the members are\ndying spiritually for want of this very work. They are becoming sickly\nand inef\ufb01cient. Transplanted, they would have room to grow strong and\nvigorous.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:244.\nAssurance of Results\nIf the lay members of the church will arouse to do the work that they can\ndo, going on a warfare at their own charges, each seeing how much he can\naccomplish in winning souls to Jesus, we shall see many leaving the ranks\nof Satan to stand under the banner of Christ. If our people will act upon the\nlight that is given in these few words of instruction, we shall surely see of the\nsalvation of God. Wonderful revivals will follow. Sinners will be converted,\nand many souls will be added to the church.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n8:246.\nOur church members should feel a deep interest in home and foreign\nmissions. Great blessings will come to them as they make self-sacri\ufb01cing\nefforts to plant the standard of truth in new territory. The money invested in\nthis work will bring rich returns. New converts, rejoicing in the light received\nfrom the Word, will in their turn give of their means to carry the light of truth\nto others.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:49.\nIn \ufb01elds where the conditions are so objectionable and disheartening\nthat many workers refuse to go to them, most remarkable changes for the\nbetter may be brought about by the efforts of self-sacri\ufb01cing lay members.\nThese humble workers will accomplish much, because they put forth patient,\npersevering effort, not relying upon human power, but upon God, who gives\nthem His favor. The amount of good that these workers accomplish will never\nbe known in this world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:22, 23.\nA Lesson from the Failure of Ancient Israel\nWhen the Israelites entered Canaan, they did not ful\ufb01l God\u2019s purpose by\ntaking possession of the whole land. After making a partial conquest, they\nsettled down to enjoy the\n184\nfruit of their victories. In their unbelief and love of ease, they congregated\nin the portions already conquered, instead of pushing forward to occupy new\nterritory. Thus they began to depart from God. By their failure to carry out\nHis purpose they made it impossible for Him to ful\ufb01l to them His promise of\nblessing. Is not the church of today doing the same thing? With the whole\nworld before them in need of the gospel, professed Christians congregate\nwhere they themselves can enjoy gospel privileges. They do not feel the\nnecessity of occupying new territory, carrying the message of salvation into\nregions beyond. They refuse to ful\ufb01l Christ\u2019s commission, \u201cGo ye into all the\nworld, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Are they less guilty than was\nthe Jewish church?\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:119.\n185\nChap. 17 - Christian Help Work\nTracing the Divine Footprints\nMany feel that it would be a great privilege to visit the scenes of Christ\u2019s\nlife on earth, to walk where He trod, to look upon the lake beside which He\nloved to teach, and the hills and valleys on which His eyes so often rested. But\nwe need not go to Nazareth, to Capernaum, or to Bethany, in order to walk\nin the steps of Jesus. We shall \ufb01nd His footprints beside the sick-bed, in the\nhovels of poverty, in the crowded alleys of the great city, and in every place\nwhere there are human hearts in need of consolation. In doing as Jesus did\nwhen on earth, we shall walk in His steps.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 640.\nJesus worked to relieve every case of suffering that He saw. He had little\nmoney to give, but He often denied Himself of food in order to relieve those\nwho appeared more needy than He. His brothers felt that His in\ufb02uence went\nfar to counteract theirs. He possessed a tact which none of them had, or desired\nto have. When they spoke harshly to poor, degraded beings, Jesus sought out\nthese very ones, and spoke to them words of encouragement. To those who\nwere in need He would give a cup of cold water, and would quietly place\nHis own meal in their hands. As He relieved their sufferings, the truths He\ntaught were associated with His acts of mercy, and were thus riveted in the\nmemory.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 86, 87.\nThe Indorsement\nThe followers of Christ are to labor as He did. We are to feed the hungry,\nclothe the naked, and comfort the suffering and af\ufb02icted. We are to minister\nto the despairing, and inspire hope in the hopeless. And to us also the promise\nwill be ful\ufb01lled, \u201cThy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the Lord\nshall be thy rearward.\u201d\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 350.\n186\nThose who have been engaged in this Christian help work have been doing\nwhat the Lord desires to have done, and He has accepted their labors. That\nwhich has been done in this line is a work which every Seventh-day Adventist\nshould heartily sympathize with and indorse, and take hold of earnestly. In\nneglecting this work which is within their own borders, in refusing to bear\nthese burdens, the church is meeting with great loss. Had the church taken up\nthis work as they should have done, they would have been the means of saving\nmany souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:295.\nAll His gifts are to be used in blessing humanity, in relieving the suffering\nand the needy. We are to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for the\nwidow and the fatherless, to minister to the distressed and downtrodden. God\nnever meant that the widespread misery in the world should exist. He never\nmeant that one man should have an abundance of the luxuries of life, while the\nchildren of others should cry for bread. The means over and above the actual\nnecessities of life are intrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity. The\nLord says, \u201cSell that ye have, and give alms.\u201d Be \u201cready to distribute, willing\nto communicate.\u201d \u201cWhen thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed,\nthe lame, the blind.\u201d \u201cLoose the bands of wickedness,\u201d \u201cundo the heavy\nburdens,\u201d \u201clet the oppressed go free,\u201d \u201cbreak every yoke.\u201d \u201cDeal thy bread to\nthe hungry,\u201d \u201cbring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\u201d \u201cWhen thou seest\nthe naked, ... cover him.\u201d \u201cSatisfy the af\ufb02icted soul.\u201d \u201cGo ye into all the world,\nand preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d These are the Lord\u2019s commands.\nAre the great body of professed Christians doing this work?\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 370, 371.\nGood deeds are the fruit that Christ requires us to bear; kind words, deeds\nof benevolence, of tender regard for the poor, the needy, the af\ufb02icted. When\nhearts sympathize with hearts burdened with discouragement and grief, when\nthe hand dispenses to the needy, when the naked are clothed, the stranger made\nwelcome to a seat in your parlor and a place in your heart, angels are coming\nvery near, and an answering strain is responded to in heaven. Every act of\n187\njustice, mercy, and benevolence, makes melody in heaven. The Father from\nHis throne beholds those who do these acts of mercy, and numbers them with\nHis most precious treasures. \u201cAnd they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts,\nin that day when I make up My jewels.\u201d Every merciful act to the needy,\nthe suffering, is regarded as though done to Jesus. When you succor the\npoor, sympathize with the af\ufb02icted and oppressed, and befriend the orphan,\nyou bring yourselves into a closer relationship to Jesus.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:25.\nThe work of gathering in the needy, the oppressed, the suffering, the\ndestitute, is the very work which every church that believes the truth for\nthis time should long since have been doing. We are to show the tender\nsympathy of the Samaritan in supplying physical necessities, feeding the\nhungry, bringing the poor that are cast out to our homes, gathering from God\nevery day grace and strength that will enable us to reach to the very depths of\nhuman misery, and help those who cannot possibly help themselves. In doing\nthis work we have a favorable opportunity to set forth Christ the cruci\ufb01ed\nOne.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:276.\nMany wonder why their prayers are so lifeless, their faith so feeble and\nwavering, their Christian experience so dark and uncertain. \u201cHave we not\nfasted,\u201d they say, \u201cand walked mournfully before the Lord of hosts?\u201d In\nthe \ufb01fty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, Christ has shown how this condition of\nthings may be changed.... Verses 6, 7. This is the recipe that Christ has\nprescribed for the faint-hearted, doubting, trembling soul. Let the sorrowful\nones, who walk mournfully before the Lord, arise and help someone who\nneeds help.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:266.\nThe glory of heaven is in lifting up the fallen, comforting the distressed.\nAnd wherever Christ abides in human hearts, He will be revealed in the same\nway. Wherever it acts, the religion of Christ will bless. Wherever it works,\nthere is brightness.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 386.\nThe widow of Zarephath shared her morsel with Elijah; and in return, her\nlife and that of her son were preserved. And to all who, in time of trial and\nwant, give sympathy\n188\nand assistance to others more needy, God has promised great blessing. He has\nnot changed. His power is no less now than in the days of Elijah.\u2014 Prophets\nand Kings, 131, 132.\nThe love of Christ, manifested in unsel\ufb01sh ministry, will be more effective\nin reforming the evil-doer than will the sword or the court of justice. These\nare necessary to strike terror to the lawbreaker, but the loving missionary can\ndo more than this. Often the heart that hardens under reproof will melt under\nthe love of Christ.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 106.\nTo Be Remembered\nIn all our associations it should be remembered that in the experience of\nothers there are chapters sealed from mortal sight. On the pages of memory\nare sad histories that are sacredly guarded from curious eyes. There stand\nregistered long, hard battles with trying circumstances, perhaps troubles in the\nhome life, that day by day weaken courage, con\ufb01dence, and faith. Those who\nare \ufb01ghting the battle of life at great odds may be strengthened and encouraged\nby little attentions that cost only a loving effort. To such the strong, helpful\ngrasp of the hand by a true friend is worth more than gold or silver. Words of\nkindness are as welcome as the smile of angels.\nThere are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled to labor hard\nfor small wages, and able to secure but the barest necessities of life. Toil\nand deprivation, with no hope of better things, make their burden very\nheavy. When pain and sickness are added, the burden is almost insupportable.\nCareworn and oppressed, they know not where to turn for relief. Sympathize\nwith them in their trials, their heartaches, and disappointments. This will open\nthe way for you to help them. Speak to them of God\u2019s promises, pray with and\nfor them, inspire them with hope.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 158.\nThere are many to whom life is a painful struggle; they feel their\nde\ufb01ciencies, and are miserable and unbelieving; they think they have nothing\nfor which to be grateful. Kind\n189\nwords, looks of sympathy, expressions of appreciation, would be to many a\nstruggling and lonely one as the cup of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of\nsympathy, an act of kindness, would lift burdens that rest heavily upon weary\nshoulders. And every word or deed of unsel\ufb01sh kindness is an expression of\nthe love of Christ for lost humanity.\u2014 Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing ,\n23.\nExtend a Helping Hand\nSin is the greatest of all evils, and it is ours to pity and help the sinner.\nBut not all can be reached in the same way. There are many who hide their\nsoul-hunger. These would be greatly helped by a tender word or a kind\nremembrance. There are others who are in the greatest need, yet they know it\nnot. They do not realize the terrible destitution of the soul. Multitudes are so\nsunken in sin that they have lost the sense of eternal realities, lost the similitude\nof God, and they hardly know whether they have souls to be saved or not. They\nhave neither faith in God nor con\ufb01dence in man. Many of these can be reached\nonly through acts of disinterested kindness. Their physical wants must \ufb01rst be\ncared for. They must be fed, cleansed, and decently clothed. As they see the\nevidence of your unsel\ufb01sh love, it will be easier for them to believe in the love\nof Christ.\nThere are many who err, and who feel their shame and their folly. They\nlook upon their mistakes and errors until they are driven almost to desperation.\nThese souls we are not to neglect. When one has to swim against the stream,\nthere is all the force of the current driving him back. Let a helping hand then be\nheld out to him as was the elder Brother\u2019s hand to the sinking Peter. Speak to\nhim hopeful words that will establish con\ufb01dence and awaken love.\u2014 Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons, 387.\nTo the soul weary of a life of sin, but knowing not where to \ufb01nd relief,\npresent the compassionate Saviour. Take him by the hand, lift him up, speak\nto him words of courage and hope. Help him to grasp the hand of the\nSaviour.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 168.\n190\nHospitality a Christian Duty\nOur work in this world is to live for others\u2019 good, to bless others, to be\nhospitable; and frequently it may be only at some inconvenience that we can\nentertain those who really need our care and the bene\ufb01t of our society and\nour homes. Some avoid these necessary burdens. But some one must bear\nthem; and because the brethren in general are not lovers of hospitality, and\ndo not share equally in these Christian duties, a few who have willing hearts,\nand who cheerfully make the cases of those who need help their own, are\nburdened.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:645.\n\u201cBe not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained\nangels unawares.\u201d These words have lost none of their force through the lapse\nof time. Our heavenly Father still continues to place in the pathway of His\nchildren opportunities that are blessings in disguise; and those who improve\nthese opportunities \ufb01nd great joy.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 132.\nThe Testing Process\nGod tests and proves us by the common occurrences of life. It is the little\nthings which reveal the chapters of the heart. It is the little attentions, the\nnumerous small incidents and simple courtesies of life, that make up the sum\nof life\u2019s happiness; and it is the neglect of kindly, encouraging, affectionate\nwords, and the little courtesies of life, which helps compose the sum of life\u2019s\nwretchedness. It will be found at last that the denial of self for the good and\nhappiness of those around us, constitutes a large share of the life record in\nheaven.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:133.\nI saw that it is in the providence of God that widows and orphans, the blind,\nthe deaf, the lame, and persons af\ufb02icted in a variety of ways, have been placed\nin close Christian relationship to His church; it is to prove His people and\ndevelop their true character. Angels of God are watching to see how we treat\nthese persons who need our sympathy, love, and disinterested benevolence.\nThis is God\u2019s test of our character. If we have the true religion of the Bible,\nwe shall feel that a debt of love, kindness, and interest is due\n191\nto Christ in behalf of His brethren; and we can do no less than to show our\ngratitude for His immeasurable love to us while we were sinners unworthy\nof His grace, by having a deep interest and unsel\ufb01sh love for those who are\nour brethren, and who are less fortunate than ourselves.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 3:511.\nA Parable Applied\nThe two great principles of the law of God are supreme love to God and\nunsel\ufb01sh love to our neighbor. The \ufb01rst four commandments and the last six\nhang upon, or grow out of, these two principles. Christ explained to the lawyer\nwho his neighbor was in the illustration of the man who was traveling from\nJerusalem to Jericho, and who fell among thieves, and was robbed, and beaten,\nand left half dead. The priest and the Levite saw this man suffering, but their\nhearts did not respond to his wants. They avoided him by passing by on the\nother side. The Samaritan came that way, and when he saw the stranger\u2019s need\nof help, he did not question whether he was a relative, or was of his country or\ncreed; but he went to work to help the sufferer because there was work which\nneeded to be done. He relieved him as best he could, put him upon his own\nbeast, and carried him to an inn, and made provision for his wants at his own\nexpense.\nThis Samaritan, said Christ, was neighbor to him who fell among thieves.\nThe Levite and the priest represent a class in the church who manifest an\nindifference to the very ones who need their sympathy and help. This class,\nnotwithstanding their position in the church, are commandment breakers. The\nSamaritan represents a class who are true helpers with Christ, and who are\nimitating His example in doing good.\nThose who have pity for the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the af\ufb02icted,\nthe widows, the orphans, and the needy, Christ represents as commandment\nkeepers, who shall have eternal life.... Christ regards all acts of mercy,\nbenevolence, and thoughtful consideration for the unfortunate, the blind, the\nlame, the sick, the widow, and the orphan, as done\n192\nto Himself; and these works are reserved in the heavenly records and will be\nrewarded. On the other hand, a record will be written in the book against those\nwho manifest the indifference of the priest and the Levite to the unfortunate,\nand those who take any advantage of the misfortunes of others, and increase\ntheir af\ufb02iction in order to sel\ufb01shly advantage themselves. God will surely\nrepay every act of injustice, and every manifestation of careless indifference\nto and neglect of the af\ufb02icted among us. Every one will \ufb01nally be rewarded as\nhis works have been.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:511-513.\n193\nChap. 18 - The Camp-Meeting an Aid in\nChristian Service\nImportance\nThe camp-meeting is one of the most important agencies in our work.\nIt is one of the most effective methods of arresting the attention of the\npeople.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:31.\nIn our work we have been perplexed to know how to break through\nthe barriers of worldliness and prejudice, and bring before the people the\nprecious truth which means so much to them. The Lord has instructed us\nthat the camp-meeting is one of the most important instrumentalities for the\naccomplishment of this work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:31, 32.\nObject\nWhat is the object of assembling together? Is it to inform God, to instruct\nHim by telling Him all we know in prayer? We meet together to edify one\nanother by an interchange of thoughts and feelings, to gather strength, and\nlight, and courage by becoming acquainted with one another\u2019s hopes and\naspirations; by our earnest, heartfelt prayers, offered up in faith, we receive\nrefreshment and vigor from the Source of our strength.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:578.\nOur camp-meetings have another object.... They are to promote spiritual\nlife among our own people.... God has committed to our hands a most sacred\nwork, and we need to meet together to receive instruction, that we may\nbe \ufb01tted to perform this work. We need to understand what part we shall\nindividually be called upon to act in building up the cause of God in the earth,\nin vindicating God\u2019s holy law, and in lifting up the Saviour as \u201cthe Lamb of\nGod, which taketh away the sin of the world.\u201d John 1:29. We need to meet\ntogether and receive the divine touch that we may understand our work in the\nhome.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:32, 33.\n194\nProperly conducted, the camp-meeting is a school where pastors, elders,\nand deacons can learn to do more perfect work for the Master. It should be a\nschool where the members of the church, old and young, are given opportunity\nto learn the way of the Lord more perfectly, a place where believers can receive\nan education that will help them to help others.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:49.\nIn connection with our camp-meetings in past years, God\u2019s servants have\nimproved many precious opportunities for instructing our people in practical\nmethods of presenting the saving truths of the third angel\u2019s message to\ntheir friends and acquaintances. Many have been taught how to labor as\nself-supporting missionaries in their home communities. Many have returned\nhome from these annual gatherings, to labor with greater zeal and intelligence\nthan hitherto. It would be pleasing to God if far more of this practical\ninstruction were given the church members who attend our camp-meetings,\nthan has usually been given in years past. Our general workers and our\nbrethren and sisters in every conference should remember that one of the\nobjects of our annual gatherings is that all may gain a knowledge of practical\nmethods of personal missionary work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:81.\nIn some of our conferences, the leaders have hesitated to introduce these\npractical methods of instruction. Some are naturally inclined to sermonize\nrather than to teach. But on such occasions as our annual camp-meetings,\nwe must never lose sight of the opportunities afforded for teaching the\nbelievers how to do practical missionary work in the place where they may\nlive.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:82.\nPractical Demonstration of Missionary Methods\nBy engaging in work at the camp-meeting, all may be learning how to\nwork successfully in their home churches.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:49.\nAt some of our camp-meetings, strong companies of workers have been\norganized to go out into the city and its suburbs to distribute literature and\ninvite people to the meetings. By this means hundreds of persons were secured\n195\nas regular attendants during the last half of the meeting who otherwise might\nhave thought little about it.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:36.\nWe can go to the camp-meeting, not merely to receive, but to impart. Every\none who is a partaker of Christ\u2019s pardoning love, every one who has been\nenlightened by the Spirit of God and converted to the truth, will feel that for\nthese precious blessings he owes a debt to every soul with whom he comes\nin contact. Those who are humble in heart the Lord will use to reach souls\nwhom the ordained ministers cannot reach. They will be moved to speak\nwords which reveal the saving grace of Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:43.\nWhen we follow plans of the Lord\u2019s devising, we are \u201claborers together\nwith God.\u201d Whatever our position,\u2014whether presidents of conferences,\nministers, teachers, students, or lay members,\u2014we are held accountable by\nthe Lord for making the most of our opportunities to enlighten those in need\nof present truth. And one of the principal agencies He has ordained for our use\nis the printed page. In our schools and sanitariums, in our home churches, and\nparticularly in our annual camp-meetings, we must learn to make a wise use\nof this precious agency. With patient diligence, chosen workers must instruct\nour people how to approach unbelievers in a kindly, winning way, and how to\nplace in their hands literature in which the truth for this time is presented with\nclearness and power.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:86, 87.\nThe work at our camp-meetings should be conducted, not according to\nman\u2019s devising, but after the manner of Christ\u2019s working. The church members\nshould be drawn out to labor.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:120.\nSpecial Feature of Camp-Meetings Near the End of Time\nIt has been shown me that our camp-meetings are to increase in interest\nand success. As we approach nearer the end, I have seen that in these meetings\nthere will be less preaching, and more Bible study. There will be little\n196\ngroups all over the ground with their Bibles in their hands, and different ones\nleading out in a free, conversational study of the Scriptures.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 6:87.\nSerious Loss in Remaining Away\nOur camp-meetings are arranged and held at great expense. God\u2019s\nministers who advocate unpopular truth, labor excessively at these large\ngatherings to bear the message of mercy from a cruci\ufb01ed Redeemer to poor\nfallen sinners. To neglect or treat these messages with indifference, is to\nslight the mercy of God and His voice of warning and entreaty. Your\nabsence from these meetings has been very detrimental to your spiritual\nwelfare. You have missed the strength that you might have gained there by\nlistening to the preached word of God, and mingling with the believers of the\ntruth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:115.\nIt is no small matter for a family to stand as representatives of Jesus,\nkeeping God\u2019s law in an unbelieving community. We are required to be\nliving epistles, known and read of all men. This position involves fearful\nresponsibilities. In order to live in the light, you must come where the light\nshines. Brother K, at any sacri\ufb01ce, should feel under solemn obligation to\nattend, with his family, at least the yearly gatherings of those who love the\ntruth. It would strengthen him and them, and \ufb01t them for trial and duty. It is not\nwell for them to lose the privilege of associating with those of like faith; for the\ntruth loses its importance in their minds, their hearts cease to be enlightened\nand vivi\ufb01ed by its sanctifying in\ufb02uence, and they lose spirituality. They are\nnot strengthened by the words of the living preacher. Worldly thoughts and\nworldly enterprises are continually exercising their minds to the exclusion of\nspiritual subjects.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:106.\nLet all who possibly can, attend these yearly gatherings. All should feel\nthat God requires this of them. If they do not avail themselves of the privileges\nwhich He has provided that they may become strong in Him and in the power\nof His grace, they will grow weaker and weaker, and have less and less desire\nto consecrate all to God.\n197\nCome, brethren and sisters, to these sacred convocation meetings, to \ufb01nd\nJesus. He will come up to the feast. He will be present, and He will do for you\nthat which you most need to have done. Your farms should not be considered\nof greater value than the higher interests of the soul. All the treasures which\nyou possess, be they ever so valuable, would not be rich enough to buy you\npeace and hope, which would be in\ufb01nite gain, if it cost you all you have and\nthe toils and sufferings of a lifetime. A strong, clear sense of eternal things,\nand a heart willing to yield all to Christ, are blessings of more value than all the\nriches, and pleasures, and glories of this world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n2:575, 576.\n198\nChap. 19 - The Home-Foreign Field\nA Work Equal in Importance to That in Foreign Fields\nWake up, wake up, my brethren and sisters, and enter the \ufb01elds in America\nthat have never been worked. After you have given something for foreign\n\ufb01elds, do not think your duty done. There is a work to be done in foreign\n\ufb01elds, but there is a work to be done in America that is just as important. In\nthe cities of America there are people of almost every language. These need\nthe light that God has given to His church.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:36.\nWhile plans are being carried out to warn the inhabitants of various nations\nin distant lands, much must be done in behalf of the foreigners who have\ncome to the shores of our own land. The souls in China are no more precious\nthan the souls within the shadow of our doors. God\u2019s people are to labor\nfaithfully in distant lands, as His providence may open the way; and they are\nalso to ful\ufb01l their duty toward the foreigners of various nationalities in the\ncities and villages and country districts close by.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nJuly 25, 1918.\nIn New York City, in Chicago, and in other great centers of population,\nthere is a larger foreign element\u2014multitudes of various nationalities, and\nall practically unwarned. Among Seventh-day Adventists there is a great\nzeal\u2014and I am not saying there is any too much\u2014to work in foreign countries;\nbut it would be pleasing to God if a proportionate zeal were manifested to work\nthe cities close by. His people need to move sensibly. They need to set about\nthis work in the cities with serious earnestness. Men of consecration and talent\nare to be sent into these cities and set to work. Many classes of laborers are to\nunite in conducting these efforts to warn the people.\u2014 The Review and Herald,\nJuly 25, 1918.\n199\nA Heaven-sent Opportunity\nIn our own country there are thousands of all nations, and tongues, and\npeoples who are ignorant and superstitious, having no knowledge of the Bible\nor its sacred teachings. God\u2019s hand was in their coming to America, that they\nmight be brought under the enlightening in\ufb02uence of the truth revealed in His\nWord, and become partakers of His saving faith.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nMarch 1, 1887.\nGod in His providence has brought men to our very doors, and thrust them,\nas it were, into our arms, that they might learn the truth, and be quali\ufb01ed to\ndo a work we could not do in getting the light to men of other tongues.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, July 25, 1918.\nMany of these foreigners are here in the providence of God, that they may\nhave opportunity to hear the truth for this time, and receive a preparation that\nwill \ufb01t them to return to their own lands as bearers of precious light shining\ndirect from the throne of God.\u2014 Paci\ufb01c Union Recorder, April 21, 1910.\nGreat bene\ufb01ts would come to the cause of God in the regions beyond, if\nfaithful effort were put forth in behalf of the foreigners in the cities of our\nhomeland. Among these men and women are some who, upon accepting the\ntruth, could soon be \ufb01tted to labor for their own people in this country and\nin other countries. Many might return to the places from which they came,\nin the hope of winning their friends to the truth. They could search out their\nkinsfolk and neighbors, and communicate to them a knowledge of the third\nangel\u2019s message.\u2014 The Review and Herald, October 29, 1914.\nSlothful Neglect\nThere has been a slothful neglect and a criminal unbelief among us as a\npeople, which has kept us back from doing the work God has left us to do in\nletting our light shine forth to those of other nations.\u2014 Life Sketches, 213.\nI have been shown that, as a people, we have been asleep as to our duty in\nregard to getting the light before those\n200\nof other nations.\u2014 Life Sketches, 212.\nWe are not keeping pace with the opening providence of God. Jesus and\nangels are at work. This cause is onward, while we are standing still and being\nleft in the rear. If we would follow the opening providence of God, we should\nbe quick to discern every opening, and make the most of every advantage\nwithin our reach, to let the light extend and spread to other nations.\u2014 Life\nSketches, 212, 213.\nStrengthen the Hands of the Workers\nGod would be pleased to see far more accomplished by His people in the\npresentation of the truth for this time to the foreigners of America, than has\nbeen done in the past. Let us strengthen the hands of Elder Olsen [Elder O. A.\nOlsen was then general secretary for the north American foreign department\nof the general conference.] and his associates in labor. Let us not permit them\nto struggle on alone, with only a meager allowance for the prosecution of their\ngreat work.\u2014 The Review and Herald, October 29, 1914.\nElder Olsen told us also of the encouraging beginnings among the Italians,\nSerbians, Rumanians, Russians, and several other nationalities. We rejoice\nwith him in all that has been done, and yet our hearts were made sad by\nthe knowledge that much that might have been done has been left undone\nbecause of lack of means. We hope that the special collection ... taken in all\nour churches in America, will enable our brethren having this department in\ncharge to do more aggressive work in the great cities of the land. Thus many\nmay be won to our ranks, and from among these may be developed laborers\nwho can proclaim the message to those of their own nationality in our own\nland and in the other nations of earth.\u2014 The Review and Herald, October 29,\n1914.\n201\nChap. 20 - Reaching The Wealthy And\nIn\ufb02uential\nNot to Be Neglected\nThere is a work to be done for the wealthy. They need to be awakened\nto their responsibility as those intrusted with the gifts of heaven. They need\nto be reminded that they must give an account to Him who shall judge the\nliving and the dead. The wealthy man needs your labor in the love and fear\nof God. Too often he trusts in his riches, and feels not his danger. The eyes\nof his mind need to be attracted to things of enduring value.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 230.\nThose who stand high in the world for their education, wealth, or calling,\nare seldom addressed personally in regard to the interests of the soul. Many\nChristian workers hesitate to approach these classes. But this should not be.\nIf a man were drowning, we would not stand by and see him perish because\nhe was a lawyer, a merchant, or a judge. If we saw persons rushing over a\nprecipice, we would not hesitate to urge them back, whatever might be their\nposition or calling. Neither should we hesitate to warn men of the peril of the\nsoul. None should be neglected because of their apparent devotion to worldly\nthings.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 230, 231.\nWe are to have travail of soul for those who are in high places; we are\nto extend to them the gracious invitation to come to the marriage feast.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\nThe Lord desires that moneyed men shall be converted, and act as His\nhelping hand in reaching others. He desires that those who can help in the\nwork of reform and restoration shall see the precious light of truth and be\ntransformed in character, and led to use their intrusted capital in His service.\nHe would have them invest the means He has lent them, in doing good, in\nopening the way for the gospel to be preached to all classes nigh and afar\noff.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:114.\n202\nThose who belong to the higher ranks of society are to be sought out with\ntender affection and brotherly regard. Men in business life, in high positions of\ntrust, men with large inventive faculties and scienti\ufb01c insight, men of genius,\nteachers of the gospel whose minds have not been called to the special truths\nfor this time,\u2014these should be the \ufb01rst to hear the call. To them the invitation\nmust be given.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 230.\nMistakes have been made in not seeking to reach ministers and the higher\nclasses with the truth. People not of our faith have been shunned altogether too\nmuch. While we should not associate with them to receive their mold, there\nare honest ones everywhere for whom we should labor cautiously, wisely, and\nintelligently, full of love for their souls. A fund should be raised to educate\nmen and women to labor for these higher classes, both here and in other\ncountries.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:580, 581.\nSpecial Quali\ufb01cations of Workers\nSome are especially \ufb01tted to work for the higher classes. These should\nseek wisdom from God to know how to reach these persons, to have not merely\na casual acquaintance with them, but by personal effort and living faith to\nawaken them to the needs of the soul, to lead them to a knowledge of the truth\nas it is in Jesus.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 213.\nLet those who work for the higher classes bear themselves with true\ndignity, remembering that angels are their companions. Let them keep the\ntreasure-house of mind and heart \ufb01lled with, \u201cIt is written.\u201d\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 215.\nIn every effort to reach the higher classes, the worker for God needs strong\nfaith. Appearances may seem forbidding; but in the darkest hour there is light\nabove.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 242.\nGod calls for earnest, humble workers, who will carry the gospel to the\nhigher classes.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 140.\n203\nResults Are Assured\nThere are miracles to be wrought in genuine conversions,\u2014miracles that\nare not now discerned. The greatest men of this earth are not beyond the\npower of a wonder-working God. If those who are workers together with Him\nwill be men of opportunity, doing their duty bravely and faithfully, God will\nconvert men who occupy responsible positions, men of intellect and in\ufb02uence.\nThrough the power of the Holy Spirit many will accept the divine principles.\nConverted to the truth, they will become agencies in the hand of God to\ncommunicate the light. They will have a special burden for other souls of\nthis neglected class. Time and money will be consecrated to the work of the\nLord, and new ef\ufb01ciency and power will be added to the church.\u2014 The Acts of\nthe Apostles, 140.\nMany in high social positions are heart-sore, and sick of vanity. They\nare longing for a peace which they have not. In the very highest ranks of\nsociety are those who are hungering and thirsting for salvation. Many would\nreceive help if the Lord\u2019s workers would approach them personally, with a kind\nmanner, a heart made tender by the love of Christ.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n231.\nMany of the greatest scholars and statesmen, the world\u2019s most eminent\nmen, will in these last days turn from the light, because the world by wisdom\nknows not God. Yet God\u2019s servants are to improve every opportunity to\ncommunicate the truth to these men. Some will acknowledge their ignorance\nof the things of God, and will take their place as humble learners at the feet of\nJesus, the Master Teacher.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 241-242.\nWealthy Men of Bible Times\nThis Ethiopian was a man of good standing and of wide in\ufb02uence. God\nsaw that when converted, he would give others the light he had received, and\nwould exert a strong in\ufb02uence in favor of the gospel. Angels of God were\nattending this seeker for light, and he was being drawn to the Saviour. By the\nministration of the Holy Spirit, the Lord\n204\nbrought him into touch with one who could lead him to the light.\u2014 The Acts\nof the Apostles, 107.\nWhen the Jews were trying to destroy the infant church, Nicodemus came\nforward in its defense. No longer cautious and questioning, he encouraged the\nfaith of the disciples, and used his wealth in helping to sustain the church at\nJerusalem and in advancing the work of the gospel. Those who in other days\nhad paid him reverence, now scorned and persecuted him; and he became poor\nin this world\u2019s goods; yet he faltered not in the defense of his faith.\u2014The Acts\nof the Apostles, 105.\n205\nChap. 21 - The Home a Missionary\nTraining Center\nOf First Importance\nThe home is the child\u2019s \ufb01rst school, and it is here that the foundation\nshould be laid for a life of service.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 400.\nThe \ufb01rst great business of your life is to be a missionary at\nhome.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:138.\nThe restoration and uplifting of humanity begins in the home. The work\nof parents underlies every other.... The well-being of society, the success of\nthe church, the prosperity of the nation, depend upon home in\ufb02uences.\u2014 The\nMinistry of Healing, 349.\nThe more fully the spirit of true ministry pervades the home the more fully\nit will be developed in the lives of the children. They will learn to \ufb01nd joy in\nservice and sacri\ufb01ce for the good of others.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 401.\nLet not parents forget the great mission \ufb01eld that lies before them in the\nhome. In the children committed to her every mother has a sacred charge from\nGod. \u201cTake this son, this daughter,\u201d God says. \u201cand train it for Me. Give it\na character polished after the similitude of a palace, that it may shine in the\ncourts of the Lord forever.\u201d The light and glory that shine from the throne of\nGod rest upon the faithful mother as she tries to educate her children to resist\nthe in\ufb02uence of evil.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:37.\nOur work for Christ is to begin with the family, in the home.... There is no\nmissionary \ufb01eld more important than this. By precept and example parents are\nto teach their children to labor for the unconverted. The children should be so\neducated that they will sympathize with the aged and af\ufb02icted, and will seek\nto alleviate the sufferings of the poor and distressed. They should be taught to\nbe diligent in missionary work; and from their earliest years, self-denial and\nsacri\ufb01ce for the good of others and the\n206\nadvancement of Christ\u2019s cause should be inculcated, that they may be laborers\ntogether with God. But if they ever learn to do genuine missionary work for\nothers, they must \ufb01rst learn to labor for those at home, who have a natural\nright to their of\ufb01ces of love.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:429.\nOur households must be set in order, and earnest efforts must be made to\ninterest every member of the family in missionary enterprises. We must seek\nto engage the sympathies of our children in earnest work for the unsaved, that\nthey may do their best at all times and in all places to represent Christ.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, July 4, 1893.\nThe Record of the Angel\nIf married men go into the work, leaving their wives to care for the children\nat home, the wife and mother is doing fully as great and important a work\nas the husband and father. Although one is in the mission \ufb01eld, the other\nis a home missionary, whose cares and anxieties and burdens frequently far\nexceed those of the husband and father. Her work is a solemn and important\none,\u2014to mold the minds and fashion the characters of her children, to train\nthem for usefulness here, and \ufb01t them for the future, immortal life. The\nhusband in the open missionary \ufb01eld may receive the honors of men, while\nthe home toiler may receive no earthly credit for her labor. But if she works\nfor the best interests of her family, seeking to fashion their characters after\nthe divine Model, the recording angel writes her name as one of the greatest\nmissionaries in the world. God does not see things as man\u2019s \ufb01nite vision views\nthem.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:594.\nChildren to Share Spiritual and Physical Burdens\nAll can do something. In an effort to excuse themselves, some say, \u201cMy\nhome duties, my children, claim my time and my means.\u201d Parents, your\nchildren should be your helping hand, increasing your power and ability to\nwork for the Master. Children are the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family.\nThey should be led to consecrate themselves to God, whose they are by\ncreation and by redemption.\n207\nThey should be taught that all their powers of body, mind, and soul are His.\nThey should be trained to help in various lines of unsel\ufb01sh service. Do not\nallow your children to be hindrances. With you the children should share\nspiritual as well as physical burdens. By helping others they increase their\nown happiness and usefulness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:63.\nFar-reaching In\ufb02uence of the Home\nA well-ordered Christian household is a powerful argument in favor of the\nreality of the Christian religion,\u2014an argument that the in\ufb01del cannot gainsay.\nAll can see that there is an in\ufb02uence at work in the family that affects the\nchildren, and that the God of Abraham is with them. If the homes of professed\nChristians had a right religious mold, they would exert a mighty in\ufb02uence\nfor good. They would indeed be the \u201clight of the world.\u201d\u2014 Patriarchs and\nProphets, 144.\nThe mission of the home extends beyond its own members. The Christian\nhome is to be an object lesson, illustrating the excellence of the true principles\nof life. Such an illustration will be a power for good in the world. Far\nmore powerful than any sermon that can be preached is the in\ufb02uence of a\ntrue home upon human hearts and lives. As the youth go out from such a\nhome, the lessons they have learned are imparted. Nobler principles of life\nare introduced into other households, and an uplifting in\ufb02uence works in the\ncommunity.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 352.\nThe greatest evidence of the power of Christianity that can be presented to\nthe world is a well-ordered, well-disciplined family. This will recommend the\ntruth as nothing else can; for it is a living witness of its practical power upon\nthe heart.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:304.\nGod designs that the families of earth shall be a symbol of the family in\nheaven. Christian homes, established and conducted in accordance with God\u2019s\nplan, are among His most effective agencies for the formation of Christian\n208\ncharacter and for the advancement of His work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:430.\nOur sphere of in\ufb02uence may seem narrow, our ability small, our\nopportunities few, our acquirements limited; yet wonderful possibilities are\nours through a faithful use of the opportunities of our own homes. If we\nwill open our hearts and homes to the divine principles of life, we shall\nbecome channels for currents of life-giving power. From our homes will \ufb02ow\nstreams of healing, bringing life, and beauty, and fruitfulness where now are\nbarrenness and dearth.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 355.\nChoosing the Household Banner\nI saw Satan planting his banner in the households of those who profess to\nbe God\u2019s chosen ones; but those who are walking in the light should be able\nto discern the difference between the black banner of the adversary and the\nblood-stained standard of Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:200.\nThe Importance of the Family Altar\nYou who profess to love God, take Jesus with you wherever you go; and,\nlike the patriarchs of old, erect an altar to the Lord wherever you pitch your\ntent. A reformation in this respect is needed,\u2014a reformation that shall be deep\nand broad.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:320, 321.\nSatan makes every effort to lead people away from God; and he is\nsuccessful in his purpose when the religious life is drowned in business\ncares, when he can so absorb their minds in business that they will not\ntake time to read their Bibles, to pray in secret, and to keep the offering\nof praise and thanksgiving burning on the altar of sacri\ufb01ce morning and\nevening.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:426.\nLet the family worship be made pleasant and interesting.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 5:335.\nThey [children] should be taught to respect the hour of prayer; they\nshould be required to rise in the morning so as to be present at family\nworship.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:424.\n209\nChildren need to have religion made attractive, not repulsive. The hour of\nfamily worship should be made the happiest hour of the day. Let the reading\nof the Scriptures be well chosen and simple; let the children join in singing;\nand let the prayers be short, and right to the point.\u2014 The Southern Watchman,\nJune 13, 1905.\nAt the family board and the family altar the guests are made welcome. The\nseason of prayer makes its impression on those who receive entertainment, and\neven one visit may mean the saving of a soul from death. For this work the\nLord makes a reckoning, saying, \u201cI will repay.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:347.\nChildren should be taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer.\nBefore leaving the house for labor, all the family should be called together,\nand the father, or the mother in the father\u2019s absence, should plead fervently\nwith God to keep them through the day. Come in humility, with a heart\nfull of tenderness, and with a sense of the temptations and dangers before\nyourselves and your children; by faith bind them upon the altar, entreating for\nthem the care of the Lord. Ministering angels will guard children who are thus\ndedicated to God. It is the duty of Christian parents, morning and evening, by\nearnest prayer and persevering faith, to make a hedge about their children.\nThey should patiently instruct them,\u2014kindly and untiringly teach them how\nto live in order to please God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church1:397-398.\nAbraham, \u201cthe friend of God,\u201d set us a worthy example. His was a life\nof prayer. Wherever he pitched his tent, close beside it was set up his altar,\ncalling all within his encampment to the morning and the evening sacri\ufb01ce.\nWhen his tent was removed, the altar remained. In following years, there were\nthose among the roving Canaanites who received instruction from Abraham;\nand whenever one of these came to that altar, he knew who had been there\nbefore him; and when he had pitched his tent, he repaired the altar, and there\nworshiped the living God.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 128.\n210\nChap. 22 - The Prayer And Missionary\nMeeting\nSecret of Effectual Prayer\nThe upbuilding of the kingdom of God is retarded or urged forward\naccording to the unfaithfulness or \ufb01delity of human agencies. The work is\nhindered by the failure of the human to co-operate with the divine. Men may\npray, \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven\u201d;\nbut if they fail of acting out this prayer in their lives, their petitions will be\nfruitless.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:437, 438.\nDevotional Exercises in the Balance\nAll heaven is looking upon the inhabitants of the earth. The angels and\nthe God of heaven are looking upon those who claim to be Christians, and\nweighing their devotional exercises.\u2014 Australasian Signs of the Times , June\n22, 1903.\nMaking the Meetings Interesting\nLet the missionary meeting be turned to account in teaching the people\nhow to do missionary work.\u2014 An Appeal to Our Churches in Behalf of Home\nMissionary Work, 11.\nOur prayer and social meetings should be seasons of special help and\nencouragement. Each one has a work to do to make these gatherings as\ninteresting and pro\ufb01table as possible. This can best be done by having a fresh\nexperience daily in the things of God, and by not hesitating to speak of His\nlove in the assemblies of His people. If you allow no darkness or unbelief to\nenter your hearts, they will not be manifest in your meetings.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, March 7, 1905.\nOur meetings should be made intensely interesting. They should be\npervaded with the very atmosphere of heaven. Let there be no long, dry\nspeeches and formal prayers, merely for the sake of occupying the time. All\nshould be ready to act their part with promptness, and when their duty is done,\nthe meeting should be closed. Thus the interest\n211\nwill be kept up to the last. This is offering to God acceptable worship.\nHis service should be made interesting and attractive, and not be allowed to\ndegenerate into a dry form. We must live for Christ minute by minute, hour by\nhour, and day by day; then Christ will dwell in us, and when we meet together,\nHis love will be in our hearts, welling up like a spring in the desert, refreshing\nall, and making those who are ready to perish, eager to drink of the waters of\nlife.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:609.\nDo not imagine that you can arouse the interest of the young by going\nto the missionary meeting and preaching a long sermon. Plan ways whereby\na live interest may be aroused. From week to week the young should bring\nin their reports, telling what they have tried to do for the Saviour, and what\nsuccess has been theirs. If the missionary meeting were made an occasion for\nbringing in such reports, it would not be dull, tedious, and uninteresting. It\nwould be full of interest, and there would be no lack of attendance.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 210, 211.\nWhen faith lays hold upon Christ, the truth will bring delight to the\nsoul, and the services of religion will not be dull and uninteresting. Your\nsocial meetings, now tame and spiritless, will be vitalized by the Holy Spirit;\ndaily you will have a rich experience as you practice the Christianity you\nprofess.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:437.\nTestimony of Personal Experience\nAs followers of Christ we should make our words such as to be a help and\nan encouragement to one another in the Christian life. Far more than we do,\nwe need to speak of the precious chapters in our experience.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 338.\nThe church needs the fresh, living experience of members who have\nhabitual communion with God. Dry, stale testimonies and prayers, without\nthe manifestation of Christ in them, are no help to the people. If every one\nwho claims to be a child of God were \ufb01lled with faith and light and life, what\na wonderful witness would be given to those\n212\nwho come to hear the truth! And how many souls might be won to\nChrist!\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:64.\nOur confession of His faithfulness is Heaven\u2019s chosen agency for revealing\nChrist to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace as made known through\nthe holy men of old; but that which will be most effectual is the testimony\nof our own experience. We are witnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves\nthe working of a power that is divine. Every individual has a life distinct\nfrom all others, and an experience differing essentially from theirs. God\ndesires that our praise shall ascend to Him, marked with our own individuality.\nThese precious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His grace, when\nsupported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible power, that works for the\nsalvation of souls.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 100.\nPraise and Thanksgiving\nTo praise God in fulness and sincerity of heart is as much a duty as is\nprayer. We are to show to the world and to all the heavenly intelligences that\nwe appreciate the wonderful love of God for fallen humanity, and that we are\nexpecting larger and yet larger blessings from His in\ufb01nite fulness.... After a\nspecial outpouring of the Holy Spirit, our joy in the Lord and our ef\ufb01ciency\nin His service would be greatly increased by recounting His goodness and His\nwonderful works in behalf of His children. These exercises drive back the\npower of Satan. They expel the spirit of murmuring and complaint, and the\ntempter loses ground. They cultivate those attributes of character which will\n\ufb01t the dwellers on earth for the heavenly mansions. Such a testimony will\nhave an in\ufb02uence upon others. No more effective means can be employed for\nwinning souls to Christ.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 299, 300.\nThe Lord desires us to make mention of His goodness and tell of His\npower. He is honored by the expression of praise and thanksgiving. He says,\n\u201cWhoso offereth praise glori\ufb01eth Me.\u201d The people of Israel, as they journeyed\nthrough the wilderness, praised God in sacred song. The\n213\ncommandments and promises of the Lord were set to music, and all along\nthe journey these were sung by the pilgrim travelers. And in Canaan, as they\nmet at their sacred feasts, God\u2019s wonderful works were to be recounted, and\ngrateful thanksgiving offered to His name. God desired that the whole life of\nHis people should be a life of praise.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 298, 299.\nA Dangerous Policy\nSome, fearing they will suffer loss of earthly treasure, neglect prayer and\nthe assembling of themselves together for the worship of God, that they may\nhave more time to devote to their farms or their business. They show by\ntheir works which world they place the highest estimate upon. They sacri\ufb01ce\nreligious privileges, which are essential to their spiritual advancement, for the\nthings of this life, and fail to obtain a knowledge of the divine will. They come\nshort of perfecting Christian character, and do not meet the measurement of\nGod. They make their temporal, worldly interests \ufb01rst, and rob God of the\ntime which they should devote to His service. Such persons God marks, and\nthey will receive a curse, rather than a blessing.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n2:654.\nA Comforting Promise\nGod will remember those who have met together and thought upon His\nname, and He will spare them from the great con\ufb02agration. They will be as\nprecious jewels in His sight.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:107.\n214\nChap. 23 - Miscellaneous Lines of\nMissionary Work\nConsideration for the Blind\nAngels are sent to minister to the children of God who are physically\nblind. Angels guard their steps and save them from a thousand dangers, which,\nunknown to them, beset their path.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:516.\nHe will not hearken to the prayer of His people while ... the blind and the\nsick are neglected among them.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:518.\nIf there are those in the church who would cause the blind to stumble, they\nshould be brought to justice; for God has made us guardians of the blind, the\naf\ufb02icted, the widows, and the fatherless. The stumblingblock referred to in\nthe Word of God does not mean a block of wood placed before the feet of the\nblind to cause him to stumble; but it means much more than this. It means\nany course that may be pursued to injure the in\ufb02uence of their blind brother,\nto work against his interest, or to hinder his prosperity.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 3:519.\nThe blind man has disadvantages to meet on every side in the loss of his\nsight. That heart in which pity and sympathy are not excited at seeing a blind\nman groping his way in a world clothed to him in darkness, is hard indeed, and\nmust be softened by the grace of God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:521.\nCare for Orphans\nUntil death shall be swallowed up in victory, there will be orphans to be\ncared for, who will suffer in more ways than one if the tender compassion and\nloving-kindness of our church members are not exercised in their behalf. The\nLord bids us, \u201cBring the poor that are cast out to thy house.\u201d Christianity must\nsupply fathers and mothers for these homeless ones. The compassion for the\nwidow and the orphan manifested in prayers and deeds, will come up in\n215\nremembrance before God, to be rewarded by and by.\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, June 27, 1893.\nWhen you succor the poor, sympathize with the af\ufb02icted and oppressed,\nand befriend the orphan, you bring yourselves into a closer relationship to\nJesus.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:25.\nThere are orphans that can be cared for; but many will not venture to\nundertake such a work; for it involves more labor than they care to do, leaving\nthem but little time to please themselves. But when the King shall make\ninvestigation, these do-nothing, illiberal, sel\ufb01sh souls will then learn that\nheaven is for those who have been workers, those who have denied themselves\nfor Christ\u2019s sake. No provisions have been made for those who have ever\ntaken such special care in loving and looking out for themselves. The terrible\npunishment the King threatened those on His left hand, in this case, is not\nbecause of their great crimes. They are not condemned for the things which\nthey did do, but for that which they did not do. They did not those things\nHeaven assigned them to do. They pleased themselves, and can take their\nportion with self-pleasers.\u2014 The Review and Herald, August 16, 1881.\nThere are orphans whom Christ has bidden His followers receive as a trust\nfrom God. Too often these are passed by with neglect. They may be ragged,\nuncouth, and seemingly in every way unattractive; yet they are God\u2019s property.\nThey have been bought with a price, and they are as precious in His sight as\nwe are. They are members of God\u2019s great household, and Christians as His\nstewards are responsible for them. \u201cTheir souls,\u201d He says, \u201cwill I require at\nthine hand.\u201d\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 386, 387.\nThe Lord calls on every member of the church to do your duty to these\norphans. Do not, however, work for them merely from the standpoint of duty,\nbut because you love them, and Christ died to save them. Christ has purchased\nthese souls that need your care, and He expects you to love them as He has\nloved you in your sins and waywardness.\u2014 The Review and Herald, June 27,\n1893.\n216\nHe will not hearken to the prayer of His people while the orphan,\nthe fatherless, the lame, the blind, and the sick are neglected among\nthem.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:518.\nThere is a wide \ufb01eld before all who will work for the Master in caring for\nthese friendless children and youth, placing them in a position favorable for the\nformation of a right character, that they may become children of God. There\nare unpromising children that need to be tenderly sought for; many that would\notherwise grow up in ignorance, and drift into associations that lead to vice\nand crime, may be brought into favorable surroundings, and under Christlike,\ntender watchcare may be saved to Christ.... This work for others will require\neffort and self-denial and sacri\ufb01ce; but what is the little sacri\ufb01ce that we can\nmake, in comparison with God\u2019s great gift of His only begotten Son? God\nhas granted us the privilege of becoming laborers together with Him.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, June 27, 1893.\nThe Colored Race\nThere is in this country a great, unworked \ufb01eld. The colored race,\nnumbering thousands upon thousands, appeals to the consideration and\nsympathy of every true, practical believer in Christ. These people do not\nlive in a foreign country, and they do not bow down to idols of wood and\nstone. They live among us, and again and again, through the testimonies of\nHis Spirit, God has called our attention to them, telling us that here are human\nbeings neglected. This broad \ufb01eld lies before us unworked, calling for the\nlight that God has given us in trust.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:205.\nWalls of separation have been built up between the whites and the blacks.\nThese walls of prejudice will tumble down of themselves, as did the walls\nof Jericho, when Christians obey the Word of God, which enjoins on them\nsupreme love to their Maker and impartial love to their neighbors.... Let every\nchurch whose members claim to believe the truth for this time, look at this\nneglected, downtrodden race, that as a result of slavery have been deprived of\nthe privilege\n217\nof thinking and acting for themselves.\u2014 The Review and Herald , December\n17, 1895.\nLet us set ourselves to do a work for the Southern people. Let us not be\ncontent with simply looking on, with simply making resolutions that are never\nacted upon; but let us do something heartily unto the Lord, to alleviate the\ndistress of our colored brethren.\u2014 The Review and Herald, February 4, 1896.\nThe black man\u2019s name is written in the book of life beside the white man\u2019s.\nAll are one in Christ. Birth, station, nationality, or color cannot elevate or\ndegrade men. The character makes the man. If a red man, a Chinaman, or an\nAfrican gives his heart to God in obedience and faith, Jesus loves him none\nthe less for his color. He calls him His well-beloved brother.\u2014 The Southern\nWork, 8, written March 20, 1891.\nThe day is coming when the kings and the lordly men of the earth would\nbe glad to exchange places with the humblest African who has laid hold on\nthe hope of the gospel.\u2014 The Southern Work, 8, written March 20, 1891.\nGod cares no less for the souls of the African race that may be won to\nserve Him, than He cared for Israel. He requires far more of His people than\nthey have given Him in missionary work among the people of the South of\nall classes, and especially the colored race. Are we not under even greater\nobligation to labor for the colored people than for those who have been more\nhighly favored? Who is it that held these people in servitude? Who kept them\nin ignorance?... If the race is degraded, if they are repulsive in habits and\nmanners, who made them so? Is there not much due to them from the white\npeople? After so great a wrong has been done them, should not an earnest\neffort be made to lift them up? The truth must be carried to them. They have\nsouls to save as well as we.\u2014 The Southern Work, 11, 12, written March 20,\n1891.\nTemperance Reform\nOf all who claim to be numbered among the friends of temperance,\nSeventh-day Adventists should stand in the front ranks.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n384.\n218\nOn the temperance question, take your position without wavering. Be as\n\ufb01rm as a rock.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 394.\nWe have a work to do along temperance lines besides that of speaking\nin public. We must present our principles in pamphlets and in our papers.\nWe must use every possible means of arousing our people to their duty to\nget into connection with those who know not the truth. The success we\nhave had in missionary work has been fully proportionate to the self-denying,\nself-sacri\ufb01cing efforts we have made. The Lord alone knows how much we\nmight have accomplished if as a people we had humbled ourselves before Him,\nand proclaimed the temperance truth in clear, straight lines.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n385.\nThe temperance question is to receive decided support from God\u2019s people.\nIntemperance is striving for the mastery; self-indulgence is increasing, and the\npublications treating on health reform are greatly needed. Literature bearing\non this point is the helping hand of the gospel, leading souls to search the\nBible for a better understanding of the truth. The note of warning against\nthe great evil of intemperance should be sounded; and that this may be done,\nevery Sabbathkeeper should study and practice the instruction contained in our\nhealth periodicals and our health books. And they should do more than this:\nthey should make earnest efforts to circulate these publications among their\nneighbors.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, November 20, 1902.\nPresent the total abstinence pledge, asking that the money they would\notherwise spend for liquor, tobacco, or like indulgences, be devoted to the\nrelief of the sick, poor, or for the training of children and youth for usefulness\nin the world.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 211.\nImportance of Follow-up Effort\nAs the result of the presentation of the truth in large congregations, a\nspirit of inquiry is awakened, and it is especially important that this interest be\nfollowed up by personal labor. Those who desire to investigate the truth, need\nto be taught to study diligently the Word of God. Some one must help them to\nbuild on the sure foundation.\n219\nAt this critical time in their religious experience, how important it is\nthat wisely directed Bible workers come to their help, and open to their\nunderstanding the treasure-house of God\u2019s Word.\u2014Testimonies for the Church\n9:111.\nThe golden moment is lost. The impressions made were not followed up.\nIt would have been better had no interest been awakened; for when convictions\nhave been once resisted and overcome, it is very dif\ufb01cult to impress the mind\nagain with the truth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:118.\nStewardship of Means\nIn all our expenditure of means, we are to strive to ful\ufb01l the purpose of\nHim who is the alpha and omega of all Christian effort.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:49.\nMoney has great value, because it can do great good. In the hands of\nGod\u2019s children it is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, and clothing\nfor the naked. It is a defense for the oppressed, and a means of help to the\nsick. But money is of no more value than sand, only as it is put to use in\nproviding for the necessities of life, in blessing others, and advancing the cause\nof Christ.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 351.\nGod Himself originated plans for the advancement of His work, and\nHe has provided His people with a surplus of means, that when He calls\nfor help, they may respond, saying,\u201d Lord, Thy pound hath gained other\npounds.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:58.\nMoney cannot be carried into the next life; it is not needed there; but the\ngood deeds done in winning souls to Christ are carried to the heavenly courts.\nBut those who sel\ufb01shly spend the Lord\u2019s gifts on themselves, leaving their\nneedy fellow creatures without aid, and doing nothing to advance God\u2019s work\nin the world, dishonor their Maker. Robbery of God is written opposite their\nnames in the books of heaven.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 266.\nWhat is the value of money at this time, in comparison with the value\nof souls? Every dollar of our means should be considered as the Lord\u2019s, not\nours; and as a precious trust from God to us; not to be wasted for needless\nindulgences,\n220\nbut carefully used in the cause of God, in the work of saving men and women\nfrom ruin.\u2014 Life Sketches, 214.\nIs not the missionary work that is to be done in our world of suf\ufb01cient\nimportance to command our in\ufb02uence and support? Should we not deny\nourselves of every extravagance, and put our gifts into the treasury of God,\nthat the truth may be sent into other countries, and that home missions may\nbe sustained? Will not this work meet the approval of Heaven? The work\nfor these last days has not been supported by large legacies, or advanced\nby worldly in\ufb02uence. It has been sustained by gifts that were the result\nof self-denial, of the spirit of sacri\ufb01ce. God has given us the privilege of\nbecoming partakers with Christ in His sufferings here, and He has provided\nthat we may have a title to an inheritance in the earth made new.\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, December 2, 1890.\nI was shown that the recording angel makes a faithful record of every\noffering dedicated to God, and put into the treasury, and also of the \ufb01nal\nresult of the means thus bestowed. The eye of God takes cognizance of every\nfarthing devoted to His cause, and of the willingness or reluctance of the giver.\nThe motive in giving is also chronicled. Those self-sacri\ufb01cing, consecrated\nones who render back to God the things that are His, as He requires of them,\nwill be rewarded according to their works. Even though the means thus\nconsecrated be misapplied, so that it does not accomplish the object which\nthe donor had in view,\u2014the glory of God and the salvation of souls,\u2014those\nwho made the sacri\ufb01ce in sincerity of soul, with an eye single to the glory of\nGod, will not lose their reward.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:518, 519.\nEvery opportunity to help a brother in need, or to aid the cause of God in\nthe spread of the truth, is a pearl that you can send beforehand, and deposit in\nthe bank of heaven for safe keeping. God is testing and proving you. He has\nbeen giving His blessings to you with a lavish hand, and is now watching to\nsee what use you are making of them, to see if you will help those who need\nhelp, and if you will\n221\nfeel the worth of souls, and do what you can with the means that He has\nintrusted to you. Every such opportunity improved adds to your heavenly\ntreasure.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:249, 250.\nHeaven\u2019s Reporting System\nAngels keep a faithful record of every man\u2019s work.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 1:198.\nEvery act of love, every word of kindness, every prayer in behalf of the\nsuffering and oppressed, is reported before the eternal throne, and placed on\nheaven\u2019s imperishable record.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:133.\nA report is borne to heaven of every successful effort on our part to dispel\nthe darkness and to spread abroad the knowledge of Christ. As the deed is\nrecounted before the Father, joy thrills through all the heavenly host.\u2014 The\nActs of the Apostles, 154.\nAngels are commissioned to be our helpers. They are passing between\nearth and heaven, bearing upward the record of the doings of the children of\nmen.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 2, 1903.\nIt were well ... to remember the record kept on high,\u2014that book in\nwhich there are no omissions, no mistakes, and out of which they will\nbe judged. There every neglected opportunity to do service for God is\nrecorded; and there, too, every deed of faith and love is held in everlasting\nremembrance.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 639.\n222\nChap. 24 - Quali\ufb01cations for Successful\nChristian Service\nEf\ufb01ciency\nListlessness and inef\ufb01ciency are not piety. When we realize that we are\nworking for God, we shall have a higher sense than we have ever had before of\nthe sacredness of spiritual service. This realization will put life and vigilance\nand persevering energy into the discharge of every duty.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:150.\nThe time demands greater ef\ufb01ciency and deeper consecration. O, I am so\nfull of this subject that I cry to God, \u201cRaise up and send forth messengers \ufb01lled\nwith a sense of their responsibility, messengers in whose hearts self-idolatry,\nwhich lies at the foundation of all sin, has been cruci\ufb01ed.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:27.\nThe work committed to the disciples would require great ef\ufb01ciency; for\nthe tide of evil ran deep and strong against them.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles ,\n31.\nCultured Speech\nThe right culture and use of the power of speech has to do with every\nline of Christian work.... We should accustom ourselves to speak in pleasant\ntones, to use pure and correct language, and words that are kind and\ncourteous.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 336.\nEvery minister and every teacher should bear in mind that he is giving\nto the people a message that involves eternal interests. The truth spoken\nwill judge them in the great day of \ufb01nal reckoning. And with some souls\nthe manner of the one delivering the message will determine its reception\nor rejection. Then let the word be so spoken that it will appeal to the\nunderstanding and impress the heart. Slowly, distinctly, and solemnly\nshould it be spoken, yet with all the earnestness which its importance\ndemands.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 336.\n223\nAs you seek to draw others within the circle of His love, let the purity\nof your language, the unsel\ufb01shness of your service, the joyfulness of your\ndemeanor, bear witness to the power of His grace.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing,\n156.\nEvery Christian is called to make known to others the unsearchable riches\nof Christ; therefore he should seek for perfection in speech. He should present\nthe word of God in a way that will commend it to the hearers. God does not\ndesign that His human channels shall be uncouth. It is not His will that man\nshall belittle or degrade the heavenly current that \ufb02ows through him to the\nworld.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 336.\nThey will be educated in patience, kindness, affability, and helpfulness.\nThey will practice true Christian courtesy, bearing in mind that Christ, their\ncompanion, cannot approve of harsh, unkind words or feelings. Their words\nwill be puri\ufb01ed. The power of speech will be regarded as a precious talent,\nlent them to do a high and holy work.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 97.\nMental Culture\nMental culture is what we, as a people, need and what we must have in\norder to meet the demands of the time.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:414.\nWe must not enter into the Lord\u2019s work haphazard, and expect success.\nThe Lord needs men of mind, men of thought. Jesus calls for coworkers, not\nblunderers. God wants right-thinking and intelligent men to do the great work\nnecessary to the salvation of souls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:67.\nSome need to discipline the mind by exercise. They should force it to\nthink. While they depend upon some one to think for them, to solve their\ndif\ufb01culties, and they refuse to tax the mind with thought, the inability to\nremember, to look ahead and discriminate, will continue. Efforts must be\nmade by every individual to educate the mind.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n2:188.\nGod does not want us to be content with lazy, undisciplined minds, dull\nthoughts, and loose memories.\u2014 Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,\n506.\n224\nMen of God must be diligent in study, earnest in the acquirement of\nknowledge, never wasting an hour. Through persevering exertion they may\nrise to almost any degree of eminence as Christians, as men of power and\nin\ufb02uence.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:411.\nOnly let the moments be treasured.... The time spent in traveling; ... the\nmoments of waiting for meals, waiting for those who are tardy in keeping\nan appointment,\u2014if a book were kept at hand, and these fragments of time\nwere improved in study, reading, or careful thought, what might not be\naccomplished!\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 343, 344.\nA resolute purpose, persistent industry, and careful economy of time, will\nenable men to acquire knowledge and mental discipline which will qualify\nthem for almost any position of in\ufb02uence and usefulness.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 334.\nMen in responsible positions should improve continually. They must not\nanchor upon an old experience, and feel that it is not necessary to become\nscienti\ufb01c workers. Man, although the most helpless of God\u2019s creatures\nwhen he comes into the world, and the most perverse in his nature, is\nnevertheless capable of constant advancement. He may be enlightened by\nscience, ennobled by virtue, and may progress in mental and moral dignity,\nuntil he reaches a perfection of intelligence and a purity of character but little\nlower than the perfection and purity of angels.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n4:93.\nThose who would be workers together with God must strive for perfection\nof every organ of the body and quality of the mind. True education is the\npreparation of the physical, mental, and moral powers for the performance of\nevery duty; it is the training of body, mind, and soul for divine service. This\nis the education that will endure unto eternal life.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n330.\nMechanics, lawyers, merchants, men of all trades and professions, educate\nthemselves that they may become masters of their business. Should the\nfollowers of Christ be less intelligent, and while professedly engaged in His\nservice, be ignorant of the ways and means to be employed? The\n225\nenterprise of gaining everlasting life is above every earthly consideration. In\norder to lead souls to Jesus there must be a knowledge of human nature and\na study of the human mind. Much careful thought and fervent prayer are\nrequired to know how to approach men and women upon the great subject of\ntruth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:67.\nChristian Dignity and Politeness\nThe lack of true dignity and Christian re\ufb01nement in the ranks of\nSabbathkeepers is against us as a people, and makes the truth which we profess\nunsavory. The work of educating the mind and manners may be carried\nforward to perfection. If those who profess the truth do not now improve\ntheir privileges and opportunities to grow up to the full stature of men and\nwomen in Christ Jesus, they will be no honor to the cause of truth, no honor\nto Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:358, 359.\nBe sure to maintain the dignity of the work by a well-ordered life and\ngodly conversation. Never be afraid of raising the standard too high.... All\ncoarseness and roughness must be put away from us. Courtesy, re\ufb01nement,\nChristian politeness, must be cherished. Guard against being abrupt and\nblunt. Do not regard such peculiarities as virtues; for God does not so regard\nthem. Endeavor not to offend any unnecessarily.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nNovember 25, 1890.\nThere is the greatest necessity that men and women who have a knowledge\nof the will of God, should learn to become successful workers in His cause.\nThey should be persons of polish, of understanding, not having the deceptive\noutside gloss and simpering affectation of the worldling, but that re\ufb01nement\nand true courteousness which savors of heaven, and which every Christian\nwill have if he is a partaker of the divine nature.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n4:358.\nWe have the greatest truth and hope that were ever given to our world,\nand the greatest faith; and we want to represent this in its exalted character to\nthe world. We do not want to assume the attitude as though we were passing\nthrough the world begging pardon of the world because\n226\nwe venture to believe this precious, sacred truth; but we want to walk humbly\nwith God, and conduct ourselves as though we were children of the most\nhigh God, and, although feeble instruments, as though we were handling most\nimportant and interesting subjects, higher and more exalted than any temporal,\nworldly themes.\u2014 The Review and Herald, July 26, 1887.\nThe laborer for souls needs consecration, integrity, intelligence, industry,\nenergy, and tact. Possessing these quali\ufb01cations, no man can be inferior;\ninstead he will have a commanding in\ufb02uence for good.\u2014Gospel Workers, 111.\nMen should be at work who are willing to be taught as to the best way\nof approaching individuals and families. Their dress should be neat, but not\nfoppish, and their manners such as not to disgust the people. There is a great\nwant of true politeness among us as a people. This should be cultivated by\nall who take hold of the missionary work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:391,\n392.\nGenuineness\nThere must be no pretense in the lives of those who have so sacred and\nsolemn a message as we have been called to bear. The world is watching\nSeventh-day Adventists, because it knows something of their profession of\nfaith, and of their high standard; and when it sees those who do not live up\nto their profession, it points at them with scorn.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:23.\nMen may have excellent gifts, good ability, splendid, quali\ufb01cations; but\none defect, one secret sin indulged, will prove to the character what the\nworm-eaten plank does to the ship,\u2014utter disaster and ruin!\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 4:90.\nPaul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who associated\nwith him felt the in\ufb02uence of his union with Christ. The fact that his\nown life exempli\ufb01ed the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing power to his\npreaching. Here lies the power of the truth. The unstudied, unconscious\nin\ufb02uence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in\nfavor of Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may provoke only\nopposition; but a godly\n227\nexample has a power that it is impossible wholly to resist.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n59.\nTrue character is not shaped from without, and put on; it radiates from\nwithin. If we wish to direct others in the path of righteousness, the principles\nof righteousness must be enshrined in our own hearts. Our profession of\nfaith may proclaim the theory of religion, but it is our practical piety that\nholds for the word of truth. The consistent life, the holy conversation, the\nunswerving integrity, the active, benevolent spirit, the godly example,\u2014these\nare the mediums through which light is conveyed to the world.\u2014 The Desire\nof Ages, 307.\nPrayers exhortation, and talk are cheap fruits, which are frequently tied\non; but fruits that are manifested in good works, in caring for the needy, the\nfatherless, and widows, are genuine fruits, and grow naturally upon a good\ntree.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:24.\nAggressiveness\nGod does not generally work miracles to advance His truth. If the\nhusbandman neglects to cultivate the soil, God works no miracle to counteract\nthe sure results. He works according to great principles made known to us,\nand it is our part to mature wise plans, and set in operation the means whereby\nGod shall bring about certain results. Those who make no decided effort,\nbut simply wait for the Holy Spirit to compel them to action, will perish in\ndarkness. You are not to sit still and do nothing in the work of God.\u2014 The\nSouthern Watchman, December 1, 1903.\nSome who engage in missionary service are weak, nerveless, spiritless,\neasily discouraged. They lack push. They have not those positive traits of\ncharacter that give power to do something,\u2014the spirit and energy that kindle\nenthusiasm. Those who would win success must be courageous and hopeful.\nThey should cultivate not only the passive but the active virtues.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 290.\nThe Lord is in need of workers who will push the triumphs of the cross of\nChrist.\u2014 The Review and Herald, May 6, 1890.\n228\nNot with tame, lifeless utterance is the message to be given, but with clear,\ndecided, stirring utterances.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:16.\nIt is not silver-tongued orators that are needed to give this message.\nThe truth in all its pointed severity must be spoken. Men of action are\nneeded,\u2014men who will labor with earnest, ceaseless energy for the purifying\nof the church and the warning of the world.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n5:187.\nGod has no use for lazy men in His cause; He wants thoughtful, kind,\naffectionate, earnest workers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:411.\nDetermination\nThose in the service of God must show animation and determination in the\nwork of winning souls. Remember that there are those who will perish unless\nwe as God\u2019s instrumentalities work with a determination that will not fail nor\nbecome discouraged.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:418.\nHe has given us a great work to do. Let us do it with accuracy\nand determination. Let us show in our lives what the truth has done for\nus.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:418.\nZeal\nIt is earnest Christian zeal that is wanted,\u2014a zeal that will be manifested\nby doing something.... No more could a soul who possesses Christ be hindered\nfrom confessing Him, than could the waters of Niagara be stopped from\n\ufb02owing over the falls.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:233.\nEvery one who accepts Christ as his personal Saviour will long for the\nprivilege of serving God. Contemplating what heaven has done for him, his\nheart is moved with boundless love and adoring gratitude. He is eager to\nsignalize his gratitude by devoting his abilities to God\u2019s service. He longs to\nshow his love for Christ and for His purchased possession. He covets toil,\nhardship, sacri\ufb01ce.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 502.\n229\nThere is a wide \ufb01eld for the Marthas, with their zeal in active religious\nwork. But let them \ufb01rst sit with Mary at the feet of Jesus. Let diligence,\npromptness, and energy be sancti\ufb01ed by the grace of Christ; then the life will\nbe an unconquerable power for good.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 525.\nIn the name of the Lord, with the untiring perseverance and un\ufb02agging\nzeal that Christ brought into His labors, we are to carry forward the work of\nthe Lord.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:25.\nWe need to break up the monotony of our religious labor. We are doing a\nwork in the world, but we are not showing suf\ufb01cient activity and zeal. If we\nwere more in earnest, men would be convinced of the truth of our message.\nThe tameness and monotony of our service for God repels many souls of a\nhigher class, who need to see a deep, earnest, sancti\ufb01ed zeal.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 6:417.\nPatience\nTo be a coworker with Jesus, you should have all patience with those for\nwhom you labor, not scorning the simplicity of the work, but looking to the\nblessed result. When those for whom you labor do not exactly meet your\nmind, you often say in your heart, \u201cLet them go; they are not worth saving.\u201d\nWhat if Christ had treated poor outcasts in a similar manner? He died to\nsave miserable sinners, and if you work in the same spirit and in the same\nmanner indicated by the example of Him whom you follow, leaving the results\nwith God, you can never in this life measure the amount of good you have\naccomplished.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:132.\nWork disinterestedly, lovingly, patiently, for all with whom you are\nbrought into contact. Show no impatience. Utter not one unkind word. Let the\nlove of Christ be in your hearts, the law of kindness on your lips.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:41.\nTact\nThose who surrender wholly to God will put thought and prayer and\nearnest, consecrated tact into their labors.\u2014 The Signs of the Times , May 29,\n1893.\n230\nIf a man has tact, industry, and enthusiasm, he will make a success in\ntemporal business, and the same qualities, consecrated to the work of God, will\nprove even doubly ef\ufb01cient; for divine power will be combined with human\neffort.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:276.\nIn the work of soul-winning, great tact and wisdom are needed. The\nSaviour never suppressed the truth, but He uttered it always in love. In His\nintercourse with others, He exercised the greatest tact, and He was always\nkind and thoughtful. He was never rude, never needlessly spoke a severe\nword, never gave unnecessary pain to a sensitive soul. He did not censure\nhuman weakness. He fearlessly denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity,\nbut tears were in His voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. He never made\ntruth cruel, but ever manifested a deep tenderness for humanity. Every soul\nwas precious in His sight. He bore Himself with divine dignity; yet He bowed\nwith the tenderest compassion and regard to every member of the family of\nGod. He saw in all, souls whom it was His mission to save.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n117.\nSome rash, impulsive, yet honest souls, after a pointed discourse has been\ngiven, will accost those who are not with us in a very abrupt manner, and make\nthe truth, which we desire them to receive, repulsive to them. \u201cThe children\nof this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.\u201d Business\nmen and politicians study courtesy. It is their policy to make themselves as\nattractive as possible. They study to render their address and manners such\nthat they may have the greatest in\ufb02uence over the minds of those about them.\nThey use their knowledge and abilities as skillfully as possible in order to gain\nthis object.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:68.\nThis message must be given, but while it must be given, we should be\ncareful not to thrust and crowd and condemn those who have not the light\nthat we have. We should not go out of our way to make hard thrusts at the\nCatholics. Among the Catholics there are many who are most conscientious\nChristians, and who walk in all the light that shines upon them, and God will\nwork in their behalf.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:243.\n231\nConstancy\nThe true Christian works for God, not from impulse, but from principle;\nnot for a day or a month, but during the entire life.\u2014 Counsels to Parents ,\nTeachers, and Students, 518.\nThe Saviour was an untiring worker. He did not measure His work by\nhours. His time, His heart, His strength, were given to labor for the bene\ufb01t\nof humanity. Entire days were devoted to labor, and entire nights were spent\nin prayer, that He might be braced to meet the wily foe in all his deceptive\nworking, and forti\ufb01ed to do His work of uplifting and restoring humanity. The\nman who loves God does not measure his work by the eight-hour system. He\nworks at all hours, and is never off duty. As he has opportunity, he does good.\nEverywhere, at all times and in all places, he \ufb01nds opportunity to work for\nGod. He carries fragrance with him wherever he goes.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:45.\nHe who by an unguarded act exposes the cause of God to reproach, or\nweakens the hands of his fellow workers, brings upon his own character a\nstain not easily removed, and places a serious obstacle in the way of his future\nusefulness.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 659.\n\u201cTake My yoke upon you,\u201d Jesus says. The yoke is an instrument of\nservice. Cattle are yoked for labor, and the yoke is essential that they may\nlabor effectually. By this illustration, Christ teaches us that we are called to\nservice as long as life shall last. We are to take upon us His yoke, that we may\nbe coworkers with Him.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 329.\nSympathy and Sociability\nIn every department of the cause of God, there is need of men and\nwomen who have sympathy for the woes of humanity; but such sympathy\nis rare.\u2014 The Review and Herald, May 6, 1890.\nWe need more of Christlike sympathy; not merely sympathy for those\nwho appear to us to be faultless, but sympathy for poor, suffering, struggling\nsouls, who are often overtaken in fault, sinning and repenting, tempted and\ndiscouraged. We are to go to our fellow men, touched, like\n232\nour merciful High Priest, with the feeling of their in\ufb01rmities.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 141.\nAs a people we lose much by lack of sympathy and sociability with one\nanother. He who talks of independence and shuts himself up to himself, is\nnot \ufb01lling the position that God designed he should. We are children of\nGod, mutually dependent upon one another for happiness. The claims of\nGod and of humanity are upon us. We must all act our part in this life. It\nis the proper cultivation of the social elements of our nature that brings us into\nsympathy with our brethren, and affords us happiness in our efforts to bless\nothers.\u2014 Testimonies 4:71, 72.\nThe Saviour was a guest at the feast of a Pharisee. He accepted invitations\nfrom the rich as well as the poor, and, according to His custom, He linked the\nscene before Him with His lessons of truth.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 219.\nSimplicity\nWhen Christ said to the disciples, Go forth in My name to gather into the\nchurch all who believe, He plainly set before them the necessity of maintaining\nsimplicity. The less ostentation and show, the greater would be their in\ufb02uence\nfor good. The disciples were to speak with the same simplicity with which\nChrist had spoken.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 28.\nThousands can be reached in the most simple and humble way. The most\nintellectual, those who are looked upon as the world\u2019s most gifted men and\nwomen, are often refreshed by the simple words of one who loves God, and\nwho can speak of that love as naturally as the worldling speaks of the things\nthat interest him most deeply. Often the words well prepared and studied have\nbut little in\ufb02uence. But the true, honest expression of a son or daughter of\nGod, spoken in natural simplicity, has power to unbolt the door to hearts that\nhave long been closed against Christ and His love.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n232.\nFaith\nGod\u2019s workers need faith in God. He is not unmindful of their labors. He\nvalues their work. Divine agencies\n233\nare appointed to co-operate with those who are laborers together with God.\nWhen we think that God will not do as He has said, and that He has no time\nto notice His workers, we dishonor our Maker.\u2014 The Southern Watchman ,\nAugust 2, 1904.\nThe worker for God needs strong faith. Appearances may seem\nforbidding; but in the darkest hour there is light beyond. The strength of\nthose who, in faith, love and serve God, will be renewed day by day.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 262.\nThere is in genuine faith a buoyancy, a steadfastness of principle, and a\n\ufb01xedness of purpose, that neither time nor toil can weaken.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 147.\nOften the Christian life is beset by dangers, and duty seems hard to\nperform. The imagination pictures impending ruin before, and bondage or\ndeath behind. Yet the voice of God speaks clearly, \u201cGo forward.\u201d We should\nobey this command, even though our eyes cannot penetrate the darkness,\nand we feel the cold waves about our feet. The obstacles that hinder our\nprogress will never disappear before a halting, doubting spirit. Those who\ndefer obedience till every shadow of uncertainty disappears, and there remains\nno risk of failure or defeat, will never obey at all. Unbelief whispers, \u201cLet\nus wait till the obstructions are removed, and we can see our way clearly;\u201d\nbut faith courageously urges an advance, hoping all things, believing all\nthings.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 290.\nCourage\nA great work is to be accomplished; broader plans must be laid; a voice\nmust go forth to arouse the nations. Men whose faith is weak and wavering\nare not the ones to carry forward the work at this important crisis. We need\nthe courage of heroes and the faith of martyrs.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n5:187.\nWhen in faith we take hold of His strength, He will change, wonderfully\nchange, the most hopeless, discouraging outlook. He will do this for the glory\nof His name. God calls upon His faithful ones, who believe in Him, to talk\ncourage to those who are unbelieving and hopeless.\n234\nMay the Lord help us to help one another, and to prove Him by living\nfaith.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:12.\nHope and courage are essential to perfect service for God. These are the\nfruit of faith. Despondency is sinful and unreasonable.\u2014 Prophets and Kings,\n164.\nCourage, energy, and perseverance they must possess. Though apparent\nimpossibilities obstruct their way, by His grace they are to go forward. Instead\nof deploring dif\ufb01culties, they are called upon to surmount them. They are to\ndespair nothing, and to hope for everything. With the golden chain of His\nmatchless love, Christ had bound them to the throne of God. It is His purpose\nthat the highest in\ufb02uence in the universe, emanating from the Source of all\npower, shall be theirs. They are to have power to resist evil, power that neither\nearth, nor death, nor hell can master, power that will enable them to overcome\nas Christ overcame.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 39.\nConsecration\nTrue holiness is wholeness in the service of God. This is the condition of\ntrue Christian living. Christ asks for an unreserved consecration, for undivided\nservice. He demands the heart, the mind, the soul, the strength. Self is not to\nbe cherished. He who lives to himself is not a Christian.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 48, 49.\nThe \ufb01rst thing to be learned by all who would become workers together\nwith God, is the lesson of self-distrust; then they are prepared to have imparted\nto them the character of Christ. This is not to be gained through education in\nthe most scienti\ufb01c schools. It is the fruit of wisdom that is obtained from the\ndivine Teacher alone.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 249, 250.\nIt is not a conclusive evidence that a man is a Christian because he\nmanifests spiritual ecstasy under extraordinary circumstances. Holiness is not\nrapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to God; it is living by every word\nthat proceeds from the mouth of God; it is doing the will of our heavenly\nFather; it is trusting God in trial, in darkness as well as in the light; it is\nwalking by faith and not by sight; it is relying on God with unquestioning\ncon\ufb01dence, and resting in His love.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 51.\n235\nWhole-Heartedness\nGod\u2019s people are to be distinguished as a people who serve Him fully,\nwhole-heartedly, taking no honor to themselves, and remembering that by a\nmost solemn covenant they have bound themselves to serve the Lord, and\nHim only.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:17.\nIt is whole-hearted, thoroughly decided men and women who will stand\nnow. Christ sifted His followers again and again, until, at one time, there\nremained only eleven and a few faithful women, to lay the foundation of the\nChristian church. There are those who will stand back when burdens are to be\nborne, but when the church is all aglow, they catch the enthusiasm, sing and\nshout, and become rapturous; but watch them. When the fervor is gone, only\na few faithful Calebs will come to the front and display unwavering principle.\nThese are salt that retains the savor. It is when the work moves hard that the\nchurches develop the true helpers.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:130.\nNo man can succeed in the service of God unless his whole heart is in the\nwork, and he counts all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of\nChrist. No man who makes any reserve can be the disciple of Christ, much\nless can he be His colaborer.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 273.\nThey are not to engage in speculation, neither are they to enter into\nbusiness enterprises with unbelievers; for this would hinder them in their\nGod-given work.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:19.\nThe Redeemer will not accept divided service. Daily the worker for God\nmust learn the meaning of self-surrender.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 113.\nLoyalty\nThe Lord abhors indifference and disloyalty in a time of crisis in His work.\nThe whole universe is watching with inexpressible interest the closing scenes\nof the great controversy between good and evil. The people of God are nearing\nthe borders of the eternal world; what can be of more importance to them than\nthat they be loyal to the God of\n236\nheaven? All through the ages, God has had moral heroes; and He has\nthem now,\u2014those who, like Joseph and Elijah and Daniel, are not ashamed\nto acknowledge themselves His peculiar people. His special blessing\naccompanies the labors of men of action; men who will not be swerved from\nthe straight line of duty, but who with divine energy will inquire, \u201cWho is on\nthe Lord\u2019s side?\u201d men who will not stop merely with the inquiry, but who\nwill demand that those who choose to identify themselves with the people\nof God shall step forward and reveal unmistakably their allegiance to the\nKing of kings and Lord of lords. Such men make their wills and plans\nsubordinate to the law of God. For love of Him, they count not their lives\ndear unto themselves. Their work is to catch the light from the Word, and\nlet it shine forth to the world in clear, steady rays. Fidelity to God is their\nmotto.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 148.\nDexterity\nIt is the duty of every Christian to acquire habits of order, thoroughness,\nand dispatch. There is no excuse for slow bungling at work of any character.\nWhen one is always at work, and the work is never done, it is because mind\nand heart are not put into the labor. The one who is slow, and who works at\na disadvantage, should realize that these are faults to be corrected. He needs\nto exercise his mind in planning how to use the time so as to secure the best\nresults. By tact and method, some will accomplish as much work in \ufb01ve hours\nas another does in ten. Some who are engaged in domestic labor are always\nat work, not because they have so much to do, but because they do not plan\nso as to save time. By their slow, dilatory ways, they make much work out of\nvery little. But all who will may overcome these fussy, lingering habits. In\ntheir work let them have a de\ufb01nite aim. Decide how long a time is required\nfor a given task, and then bend every effort toward accomplishing the work\nin a given time. The exercise of the will power will make the hands move\ndeftly.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 344.\nThe service of Christ demands prompt obedience.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, August 9, 1904.\n237\nThe Lord demands that in His servants shall be found a spirit that is quick\nto feel the value of souls, quick to discern the duties to be done, quick to\nrespond to the obligations that the Lord lays upon them.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:123.\nIndustry in a God-appointed duty is an important part of true religion. Men\nshould seize circumstances as God\u2019s instruments with which to work His will.\nPrompt and decisive action at the right time will gain glorious triumphs, while\ndelay and neglect result in failure and dishonor to God.\u2014 Prophets and Kings,\n676.\nMaintain High Standards\nMany who are quali\ufb01ed to do excellent work accomplish little because\nthey attempt little. Thousands pass through life as if they had no great object\nfor which to live, no high standard to reach. One reason of this is the low\nestimate which they place upon themselves. Christ paid an in\ufb01nite price for\nus, and according to the price paid He desires us to value ourselves.\u2014 Gospel\nWorkers, 291.\nThroughout His life on earth, Jesus was an earnest and constant worker.\nHe expected much; therefore He attempted much.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 72.\nThose who are engaged in service for the Master need an experience much\nhigher, deeper, broader, than many have yet thought of having. Many who\nare already members of God\u2019s great family know little of what it means to\nbehold His glory, and to be changed from glory to glory. Many have a twilight\nperception of Christ\u2019s excellence, and their hearts thrill with joy. They long\nfor a fuller, deeper sense of the Saviour\u2019s love. Let these cherish every desire\nof the soul after God.\u2014 Gospel Workers, 274.\nTo our ministers, physicians, teachers, and all others engaged in any line of\nservice for the Master, I have a message to bear. The Lord bids you to come up\nhigher, to reach a holier standard. You must have an experience much deeper\nthan you have yet even thought of having. Many who are already members of\nGod\u2019s great family know little of what it means to behold His glory, and to be\nchanged from glory to glory. Many of you have a\n238\ntwilight perception of Christ\u2019s excellence, and your souls thrill with joy. You\nlong for a fuller, deeper sense of the Saviour\u2019s love. You are unsatis\ufb01ed. But\ndo not despair. Give to Jesus the heart\u2019s best and holiest affections. Treasure\nevery ray of light. Cherish every desire of the soul after God. Give yourselves\nthe culture of spiritual thoughts and holy communings. You have seen by the\n\ufb01rst rays of the early dawn of His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord,\nyou will know that His going forth is prepared as the morning. \u201cThe path\nof the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more and more unto the\nperfect day.\u201d Having repented of our sins, confessed them, and found pardon,\nwe are to continue to learn of Christ, until we come into the full noontide of a\nperfect gospel faith.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:318.\nPrudence and Forethought\nWhile Nehemiah implored the help of God, he did not fold his own hands,\nfeeling that he had no more care or responsibility in the bringing about of his\npurpose to restore Jerusalem. With admirable prudence and forethought he\nproceeded to make all the arrangements necessary to insure the success of the\nenterprise. Every movement was marked with great caution.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, March 15, 1904.\nThe example of this holy man [Nehemiah] should be a lesson to all the\npeople of God, that they are not only to pray in faith, but to work with diligence\nand \ufb01delity. How many dif\ufb01culties we encounter, how often we hinder the\nworking of Providence in our behalf, because prudence, forethought, and\npainstaking are regarded as having little to do with religion! This is a grave\nmistake. It is our duty to cultivate and to exercise every power that will render\nus more ef\ufb01cient workers for God. Careful consideration and well-matured\nplans are as essential to the success of sacred enterprises today as in the time\nof Nehemiah.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, March 15, 1904.\nHow to Counteract Discouragement\nThe servants of the Lord must expect every kind of discouragement. They\nwill be tried, not only by the anger,\n239\ncontempt, and cruelty of enemies, but by the indolence, inconsistency,\nlukewarmness, and treachery of friends and helpers ... Even some who seem\nto desire the work of God to prosper, will yet weaken the hands of His servants\nby hearing, reporting, and half believing the slanders, boasts, and menaces of\ntheir adversaries.... Amid great discouragements, Nehemiah made God his\ntrust; and here is our defense. A remembrance of what the Lord has done for\nus will prove a support in every danger. \u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but\ndelivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all\nthings?\u201d And \u201cif God be for us, who can be against us?\u201d However craftily the\nplots of Satan and his agents may be laid, God can detect them, and bring to\nnaught all their counsels.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 19, 1904.\nThose who, standing in the forefront of the con\ufb02ict, are impelled by the\nHoly Spirit to do a special work will frequently feel a reaction when the\npressure is removed. Despondency may shake the most heroic faith, and\nweaken the most steadfast will. But God understands, and He still pities and\nloves. He reads the motives and the purposes of the heart. To wait patiently, to\ntrust when everything looks dark, is the lesson that the leaders in God\u2019s work\nneed to learn. Heaven will not fail them in their day of adversity. Nothing is\napparently more helpless, yet really more invincible, than the soul that feels\nits nothingness, and relies wholly on God.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 174, 175.\nThe Lord calls for soldiers who will not fail nor be discouraged; but who\nwill accept the work with all its disagreeable features. He would have us all\ntake Christ for our pattern.\u2014 The Review and Herald, July 17, 1894.\nThose who today teach unpopular truths need not be discouraged if at\ntimes they meet with no more favorable reception, even from those who claim\nto be Christians, than did Paul and his fellow workers from the people among\nwhom they labored. The messengers of the cross must arm themselves with\nwatchfulness and prayers, and move forward with faith and courage, working\nalways in the name of Jesus.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 230.\n240\nGentleness\nThe spirit that is kept gentle under provocation will speak more effectively\nin favor of the truth than will any argument, however forcible.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 353.\nAs the dew and the still showers fall upon the withering plants, so let words\nfall gently when seeking to win men from error. God\u2019s plan is \ufb01rst to reach\nthe heart. We are to speak the truth in love, trusting in Him to give it power\nfor the reforming of the life. The Holy Spirit will apply to the soul the word\nthat is spoken in love.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 157.\nA tender spirit, a gentle, winning deportment, may save the erring, and\nhide a multitude of sins. The revelation of Christ in your own character will\nhave a transforming power upon all with whom you come in contact. Let\nChrist be daily made manifest in you, and He will reveal through you the\ncreative energy of His words,\u2014a gentle, persuasive, yet mighty in\ufb02uence to\nre-create other souls in the beauty of the Lord our God.\u2014 Thoughts from the\nMount of Blessing, 129.\nImpartiality\nSo long as he lived among men, our Saviour shared the lot of the poor.\nHe knew by experience their cares and hardships, and He could comfort and\nencourage all humble workers. Those who have a true conception of the\nteaching of His life, will never feel that a distinction must be made between\nclasses, that the rich are to be honored above the worthy poor.\u2014 The Desire of\nAges, 73.\nWhen you turn from those who seem unpromising and unattractive, do\nyou realize that you are neglecting the souls for whom Christ is seeking? At\nthe very time when you turn from them, they may be in the greatest need of\nyour compassion. In every assembly for worship, there are souls longing for\nrest and peace. They may appear to be living careless lives, but they are not\ninsensible to the in\ufb02uence of the Holy Spirit. Many among them might be\nwon for Christ.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 191.\n241\nThe gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and presented only to a\nselect few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if they accept it. The message\nis to be given to all. Wherever hearts are open to receive the truth, Christ is\nready to instruct them.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 194.\nHonesty-Faithfulness-Industry\nWhen responsibilities are to be intrusted to an individual, the question\nis not asked whether he is eloquent or wealthy, but whether he is honest,\nfaithful, and industrious; for whatever may be his accomplishments, without\nthese quali\ufb01cations he is utterly un\ufb01t for any position of trust.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 4:413.\nUnsel\ufb01shness\nChrist\u2019s work is to be our example. Constantly He went about doing good.\nIn the temple and the synagogues, in the streets of the cities, in the marketplace\nand the workshop, by the seaside and among the hills, He preached the\ngospel and healed the sick. His life was one of unsel\ufb01sh service, and it is\nto be our lesson book. His tender, pitying love rebukes our sel\ufb01shness and\nheartlessness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:31.\nThe motive that prompts us to work for Lord should have in it nothing\nakin to self-serving. Unsel\ufb01sh devotion and a spirit of sacri\ufb01ce have always\nbeen and always will be the \ufb01rst requisite of acceptable service. Our Lord and\nMaster designs that not one thread of sel\ufb01shness shall be woven into His work.\nInto our efforts we are to bring the tact and skill, the exactitude and wisdom,\nthat the God of perfection required of the builders of the earthly tabernacle;\nyet in all our labors we are to remember that the greatest talents or the most\nsplendid services are acceptable only when self is laid upon the altar, a living,\nconsuming sacri\ufb01ce.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 65.\nOf all the people in the world, reformers should be the most unsel\ufb01sh, the\nmost kind, the most courteous. In their lives should be seen the true goodness\nof unsel\ufb01sh deeds.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 157.\n242\nCease to Worry\nThings will go wrong because of unconsecrated workers. You may\nshed tears over the result of this; but don\u2019t worry. The blessed Master\nhas all His work from end to end under His masterly supervision. All He\nasks is that the workers shall come to Him for their orders, and obey His\ndirections. Everything\u2014our churches, our missions, our Sabbath schools,\nour institutions\u2014is carried upon His divine heart. Why worry? The intense\nlonging to see the church a living and shining light as God designs it shall\nbe, must be tempered with entire trust in God.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nNovember 14, 1893.\nCultivate restfulness, and commit the keeping of your souls unto God as\nunto a faithful Creator. He will keep that which is committed to His trust. He is\nnot pleased to have us cover His altar with our tears and complaints. You have\nenough to praise God for already, if you do not see another soul converted.\nBut the good work will go on if you will only go forward, and not be trying to\nadjust everything to your own ideas. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts,\nand be ye thankful. Let the Lord have room to work. Do not block His way.\nHe can and will work if we will let Him.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:136.\nBear the Divine Credentials\nGod can use every person just in proportion as He can put His Spirit\ninto the soul temple. The work that He will accept is the work that re\ufb02ects\nHis image. His followers are to bear, as their credentials to the world, the\nineffaceable characteristics of His immortal principles.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 7:144.\nChrist\u2019s name was to be their watchword, their badge of distinction, their\nbond of union, the authority of their course of action, and the source of their\nsuccess. Nothing was to be recognized in His kingdom that did not bear His\nname and superscription.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 28.\nMinutemen\nBe faithful minutemen, to show forth the praises of Him who hath called\nyou out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u2014 The Review and Herald ,\nJanuary 24, 1893.\n243\nGod\u2019s servants should be minutemen, ever ready to move as fast as His\nprovidence opens the way. Any delay on their part gives time for Satan to\nwork to defeat them.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 423.\nHis commandment-keeping people are to stand constantly in readiness for\nservice.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:247.\nThose who are really representatives of Christ are working for the good of\nothers. They delight in advancing the cause of God both at home and abroad.\nThey are seen and heard, and their in\ufb02uence is felt, at the prayer meeting.\nThey will try to supply the place of the minister, whose labors they cannot\nhave. They do not seek to exalt self, or to receive credit for doing a great\nwork, but labor humbly, meekly, faithfully, doing small errands or doing a\ngreater work, if necessary, because Christ has done so much for them.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, September 6, 1881.\nBrave and True\nWhat the church needs in these days of peril, is an army of workers\nwho, like Paul, have educated themselves for usefulness, who have a deep\nexperience in the things of God, and who are \ufb01lled with earnestness and zeal.\nSancti\ufb01ed, self-sacri\ufb01cing men are needed; men who will not shun trial and\nresponsibility; men who are brave and true; men in whose hearts Christ is\nformed \u201cthe hope of glory,\u201d and who, with lips touched with holy \ufb01re, will\n\u201cpreach the word.\u201d For want of such workers the cause of God languishes,\nand fatal errors, like a deadly poison, taint the morals and blight the hopes of\na large part of the human race.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 507.\nBy aggressive warfare, in the midst of opposition, peril, loss, and human\nsuffering, the work of soul-saving is to be carried forward. At a certain battle,\nwhen one of the regiments of the attacking force was being beaten back by\nthe hordes of the enemy, the ensign in front stood his ground as the troops\nretreated. The captain shouted to him to bring back the colors, but the reply\nof the ensign was, \u201cBring the men up to the colors!\u201d This is the work that\ndevolves upon every faithful standard-bearer,\u2014to bring the\n244\nmen up to the colors. The Lord calls for whole-heartedness. We all know\nthat the sin of many professing Christians is that they lack the courage\nand energy to bring themselves and those connected with them up to the\nstandard.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:45, 46.\nGod cannot use men who, in time of peril, when the strength, courage,\nand in\ufb02uence of all are needed, are afraid to take a \ufb01rm stand for the right.\nHe calls for men who will do faithful battle against wrong, warring against\nprincipalities and powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,\nagainst spiritual wickedness in high places. It is to such as these that He\nwill speak the words: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant.\u201d\u2014 Prophets and\nKings, 142.\nGod calls for men like Elijah, Nathan, and John the Baptist,\u2014men who\nwill bear His message with faithfulness, regardless of the consequences; men\nwho will speak the truth bravely, though it call for the sacri\ufb01ce of all they\nhave.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 142.\nShepherdly Care\nThe shepherd who discovers that one of his sheep is missing, does not\nlook carelessly upon the \ufb02ock that is safely housed, and say, \u201cI have ninety\nand nine, and it will cost me too much trouble to go in search of the straying\none. Let him come back, and I will open the door of the sheepfold, and let him\nin.\u201d No; no sooner does the sheep go astray than the shepherd is \ufb01lled with\ngrief and anxiety. He counts and recounts the \ufb02ock. When he is sure that one\nsheep is lost, he slumbers not. He leaves the ninety and nine within the fold;\nand goes in search of the straying sheep. The darker and more tempestuous\nthe night, and the more perilous the way, the greater is the shepherd\u2019s anxiety,\nand the more earnest his search. He makes every effort to \ufb01nd that one lost\nsheep.\nWith what relief he hears in the distance its \ufb01rst faint cry. Following the\nsound, he climbs the steepest heights, he goes to the very edge of the precipice,\nat the risk of his own life. Thus he searches, while the cry, growing fainter,\ntells him that his sheep is ready to die. At last his effort is\n245\nrewarded; the lost is found. Then he does not scold it because it has caused\nhim so much trouble. He does not drive it with a whip. He does not even try\nto lead it home. In his joy he takes the trembling creature upon his shoulders;\nif it is bruised and wounded, he gathers it in his arms, pressing it close to his\nbosom, that the warmth of his own heart may give it life. With gratitude that\nhis search has not been in vain, he bears it back to the fold.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 187, 188.\nHumility\nIn choosing men and women for His service, God does not ask whether\nthey possess learning or eloquence or worldly wealth. He asks: \u201cDo they walk\nin such humility that I can teach them My way? Can I put My words into their\nlips? Will they represent Me?\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:144.\nIn trying to help the poor, the despised, the forsaken, do not work for them\nmounted on the stilts of your dignity and superiority, for in this way you will\naccomplish nothing.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:277.\nThat which will make our churches vigorous and successful in their efforts,\nis not bustle, but quiet, humble work; not parade and bombast, but patient,\nprayerful, persevering effort.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:130.\nThe humiliation of defeat often proves a blessing by showing us our\ninability to do the will of God without His aid.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets,\n633.\nThe talents of the humble cottager are needed in the house-to-house labor,\nand can accomplish more in this work than brilliant gifts.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 9:37, 38.\nAll heaven is interested in this work that God\u2019s messengers are carrying\nforward in the world, in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. This is a great\nwork, brethren and sisters, and we should humble ourselves daily before God,\nand not feel that our wisdom is perfect. We should take hold of the work with\nearnestness. We should not pray for God to humble us; for when God takes\nhold of\n246\nus, He will humble us in a way that we would not enjoy. But we must day\nby day humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God. We are to work out\nour own salvation with fear and with trembling. While it is God that works in\nus to will and to do of His own good pleasure, we are to co-operate with Him\nwhile He works through us.\u2014 The Review and Herald, July 12, 1887.\nWe are to strive to enter in at the strait gate. But this gate does not swing\nloosely on its hinges. It will not admit doubtful characters. We must now\nstrive for eternal life with an intensity that is proportionate to the value of\nthe prize before us. It is not money or lands or position, but the possession\nof a Christlike character, that will open to us the gates of Paradise. It is\nnot dignity, it is not intellectual attainments, that will win for us the crown\nof immortality. Only the meek and lowly ones, who have made God their\nef\ufb01ciency, will receive this gift.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 16, 1903.\nWhen you return from doing missionary work, do not praise yourself, but\nexalt Jesus; lift up the cross of Calvary.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:596.\nBefore honor is humility. To \ufb01ll a high place before men, Heaven chooses\nthe worker who, like John the Baptist, takes a lowly place before God. The\nmost childlike disciple is the most ef\ufb01cient in labor for God. The heavenly\nintelligences can co-operate with him who is seeking, not to exalt self, but to\nsave souls.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 436.\nTemperate\nWould that every child of God might be impressed with the necessity of\nbeing temperate in his eating, dressing, and working, that he may do the best\nwork for the cause of God. When the laborer has been under a pressure of\nwork and care, and is overworked in mind and body, he should turn aside and\nrest awhile, not for sel\ufb01sh grati\ufb01cation, but that he may be better prepared\nfor future duties. We have a vigilant foe, who is ever upon our track, to\ntake advantage of every weakness, that he may make his temptations effective\nfor evil. When the mind is overstrained and the body enfeebled, he can take\nadvantage, and press the soul with his\n247\n\ufb01ercest temptations, that he may cause the downfall of the child of God. Let\nthe laborer for God carefully husband his strength; and when wearied with\ntoil that must come upon him, let him turn aside and rest and commune with\nJesus.\u2014 The Review and Herald, November 14, 1893.\nThe misuse of our physical powers shortens the period of time in which\nour lives can be used for the glory of God. And it un\ufb01ts us to accomplish the\nwork God has given us to do. By allowing ourselves to form wrong habits, by\nkeeping late hours, by gratifying appetite at the expense of health, we lay the\nfoundation for feebleness. By neglecting physical exercise, by overworking\nmind or body, we unbalance the nervous system. Those who thus shorten\ntheir lives un\ufb01t themselves for service by disregarding nature\u2019s laws, are guilty\nof robbery toward God. And they are robbing their fellow men also. The\nopportunity of blessing others, the very work for which God sent them into the\nworld, has by their own course of action been cut short. And they have un\ufb01tted\nthemselves to do even that which in a briefer period of time they might have\naccomplished. The Lord holds us guilty when by our injurious habits we thus\ndeprive the world of good.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 346, 347.\nOur God is ever merciful, full of compassion, and reasonable in all His\nrequirements. He does not require that we shall pursue a course of action\nthat will result in the loss of our health or the enfeeblement of our powers of\nmind. He would not have us work under a pressure and strain until exhaustion\nfollows, and prostration of the nerves. The Lord has given us reason, and\nHe expects that we shall exercise reason, and act in harmony with the laws\nof life implanted within us, obeying them that we may have a well-balanced\norganization. Day follows day, and each day brings its responsibilities and\nduties, but the work of tomorrow must not be crowded into today. The workers\nin the cause of God should feel how sacred is its character, and they should\nprepare themselves for tomorrow\u2019s work by a judicious employment of their\npowers today.\u2014 The Review and Herald, November 7, 1893.\n248\nRest and Re\ufb02ection\nThe disciples of Jesus needed to be educated as to how they should labor,\nand how they should rest. Today there is need that God\u2019s chosen workmen\nshould listen to the command of Christ to go apart and rest awhile. Many\nvaluable lives have been sacri\ufb01ced, that need not have been, through ignorance\nof this command.... Though the harvest is great and the laborers are few,\nnothing is gained by sacri\ufb01cing health and life.... There are many feeble,\nworn workmen who feel deeply distressed when they see how much there\nis to be done, and how little they can do. How they long for physical\nstrength to accomplish more; but it is to this class that Jesus says, \u201cCome\nye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile.\u201d\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, November 7, 1893.\nThe Christian life is not made up of unceasing activity, or of continual\nmeditation. Christians must work earnestly for the salvation of the lost, and\nthey must also take time for contemplation, for prayer, and the study of the\nWord of God. It will not do to be always under the strain of the work and\nexcitement, for in this way personal piety is neglected, and the powers of mind\nand body are injured.\u2014 The Review and Herald, November 7, 1893.\nAll who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for communion\nwith their own hearts, with nature, and with God. In them is to be revealed\na life that is not in harmony with the world, its customs, or its practices; and\nthey need to have a personal experience in obtaining a knowledge of the will\nof God. We must individually hear Him speaking to the heart. When every\nother voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the\nsoul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, \u201cBe still, and know\nthat I am God.\u201d This is the effectual preparation for all labor for God. Amidst\nthe hurrying throng, and the strain of life\u2019s intense activities, he who is thus\nrefreshed, will be surrounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. He will\nreceive a new endowment of both physical and mental strength. His life will\nbreathe out a fragrance, and will reveal a divine power that will reach men\u2019s\nhearts.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 58.\n249\nChap. 25 - The Holy Spirit\nThe Promise\nTo us today, as verily as to the \ufb01rst disciples, the promise of the Spirit\nbelongs. God will today endow men and women with power from above, as\nHe endowed those who on the day of Pentecost heard the word of salvation.\nAt this very hour His Spirit and His grace are for all who need them and will\ntake Him at His word.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:20.\nThe promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any race.\nChrist declared that the divine in\ufb02uence of His Spirit was to be with His\nfollowers unto the end. From the day of Pentecost to the present time, the\nComforter has been sent to all who have yielded themselves fully to the Lord\nand to His service.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 40.\nGod desires to refresh His people by the gift of the Holy Spirit, baptizing\nthem anew in His love. There is no need for a dearth of the Holy Spirit in\nthe church. After Christ\u2019s ascension, the Holy Spirit came upon the waiting,\npraying, believing disciples with a fulness and power that reached every heart.\nIn the future the earth is to be lightened with the glory of God. A divine\nin\ufb02uence is to go forth to the world from those who are sancti\ufb01ed through the\ntruth. The earth is to be encircled with an atmosphere of grace. The Holy\nSpirit is to work on human hearts, taking the things of God and showing them\nunto men.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, September 5, 1905.\nIt is true that in the time of the end, when God\u2019s work in the earth is closing,\nthe earnest efforts put forth by consecrated believers under the guidance of the\nHoly Spirit, are to be accompanied by special tokens of divine favor. Under the\n\ufb01gure of the early and the latter rain, that falls in Eastern lands at seed-time\nand harvest, the Hebrew prophets foretold the bestowal of spiritual grace in\nextraordinary measure upon God\u2019s church. The out-pouring of the Spirit in\nthe days of the apostles was the beginning of the early,\n250\nor former rain, and glorious was the result. To the end of time, the presence of\nthe Spirit is to abide with the true church.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 54, 55.\nThe outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the \u201cformer\nrain,\u201d and glorious was the result. But the latter rain will be more abundant.\nWhat is the promise to those living in these days?\u2014\u201cTurn you to the\nstronghold, ye prisoners of hope; even today do I declare that I will render\ndouble unto thee.\u201d \u201cAsk ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so\nthe Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one\ngrass in the \ufb01eld.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:21.\nGod\u2019s Willingness to Bestow\nThe Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who serve Him\nthan parents are to give good gifts to their children.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles,\n50.\nAt all times and in all places, in all sorrows and in all af\ufb02ictions, when the\noutlook seems dark and the future perplexing, and we feel helpless and alone,\nthe Comforter will be sent in answer to the prayer of faith. Circumstances may\nseparate us from every earthly friend; but no circumstance, no distance, can\nseparate us from the heavenly Comforter. Wherever we are, wherever we may\ngo, He is always at our right hand to support, sustain, uphold, and cheer.\u2014The\nDesire of Ages, 669, 670.\nMorning by morning, as the heralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord\nand renew their vows of consecration to Him, He will grant them the presence\nof His Spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go forth to the\nday\u2019s duties, they have the assurance that the unseen agency of the Holy Spirit\nenables them to be \u201claborers together with God.\u201d\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles ,\n56.\nWe are living in the time of the Holy Spirit\u2019s power. It is seeking to\ndiffuse itself through the agency of humanity, thus increasing its in\ufb02uence\nin the world.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, November 3, 1903\n251\nConditions of Receiving\nThe Holy Spirit will come to all who are begging for the bread of life to\ngive to their neighbors.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:90.\nWhen we bring our hearts into unity with Christ, and our lives into\nharmony with His work, the Spirit that fell on the disciples on the day of\nPentecost will fall on us.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:246.\nIt is not because of any restriction on the part of God that the riches of His\ngrace do not \ufb02ow earthward to men.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 419.\nThe Spirit awaits our demand and reception.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n121.\nSince this is the means by which we are to receive power, why do we not\nhunger and thirst for the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not talk of it, pray for\nit, and preach concerning it?\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 50.\nIf the ful\ufb01llment of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is because the\npromise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing, all would be\n\ufb01lled with the Spirit.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 50.\nFor the daily baptism of the Spirit, every worker should offer his petition\nto God. Companies of Christian workers should gather to ask for special help,\nfor heavenly wisdom, that they may know how to plan and execute wisely.\nEspecially should they pray that God will baptize His chosen ambassadors in\nmission \ufb01elds with a rich measure of His Spirit.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 50,\n51.\nLet Christians put away all dissension, and give themselves to God for the\nsaving of the lost. Let them ask in faith for the promised blessing, and it will\ncome.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:21.\nThe disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They were\nweighted with the burden of souls. The gospel was to be carried to the ends of\nthe earth, and they claimed the endowment of power that Christ had promised.\nThen it was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands were converted\nin a day.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, August 1, 1905.\n252\nChrist has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the\npromise belongs to us as much as to the \ufb01rst disciples. But like every other\npromise, it is given on conditions. There are many who believe and profess to\nclaim the Lord\u2019s promise; they talkabout Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet\nreceive no bene\ufb01t. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled\nby the divine agencies. We cannot use the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is to use us.\nThrough the Spirit God works in His people \u201cto will and to do of His good\npleasure.\u201d But many will not submit to this. They want to manage themselves.\nThis is why they do not receive the heavenly gift. Only to those who wait\nhumbly upon God, who watch for His guidance and grace, is the Spirit given.\nThe power of God awaits their demand and reception. This promised blessing,\nclaimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train. It is given according to\nthe riches of the grace of Christ, and He is ready to supply every soul according\nto the capacity to receive.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 672.\nThe great outpouring of the Spirit of God, which lightens the whole earth\nwith His glory, will not come until we have an enlightened people, that know\nby experience what it means to be laborers together with God. When we\nhave entire, wholehearted consecration to the service of Christ, God will\nrecognize the fact by an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this\nwill not be while the largest portion of the church are not laborers together\nwith God.\u2014 The Review and Herald, July 21, 1896.\nEssential to Success\nThe presence of the Spirit with God\u2019s workers, will give the proclamation\nof truth a power that not all the honor or glory of the world could give.\u2014 The\nActs of the Apostles, 51.\nGod does not ask us to do in our own strength the work before us. He\nhas provided divine assistance for all the emergencies to which our human\nresources are unequal. He gives the Holy Spirit to help in every strait, to\nstrengthen our hope and assurance, to illuminate our minds and purify our\nhearts.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, August 1, 1905.\n253\nAfter the descent of the Holy Spirit, the disciples were so \ufb01lled with love\nfor Him [Christ] and for those for whom He died, that hearts were melted\nby the words they spoke and the prayers they offered. They spoke in the\npower of the Spirit; and under the in\ufb02uence of that power, thousands were\nconverted.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 22.\nThere is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self aside, makes\nroom for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and lives a life wholly\nconsecrated to God.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, August 1, 1905.\nWhat was the result of the outpouring of the Spirit upon the day of\nPentecost?\u2014The glad tidings of a risen Saviour were carried to the utmost\nbounds of the known world.... Under their labors there were added to the\nchurch chosen men, who, receiving the word of life, consecrated their lives to\nthe work of giving to others the hope that had \ufb01lled their hearts with peace\nand joy. Hundreds proclaimed the message, \u201cThe kingdom of God is at hand.\u201d\nThey could not be restrained or intimidated by threatenings. The Lord spoke\nthrough them; and wherever they went, the sick were healed, and the poor had\nthe gospel preached unto them. So mightily can God work when men give\nthemselves up to the control of His Spirit.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, August\n1, 1905.\nThe Holy Spirit is the breath of spiritual life in the soul. The impartation\nof the Spirit is the impartation of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver\nwith the attributes of Christ. Only those who are thus taught of God, those\nwho possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in whose life the Christ-life\nis manifested, are to stand as representative men, to minister in behalf of the\nchurch.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 805.\nPeculiar and rapid changes will soon take place, and God\u2019s people are to\nbe endowed with the Holy Spirit, so that with heavenly wisdom they may meet\nthe emergencies of this age, and as far as possible counteract the demoralizing\nmovements of the world. If the church is not asleep,\n254\nif the followers of Christ watch and pray, they may have light to comprehend\nand appreciate the movements of the enemy.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n6:436.\nPromise Unappreciated\nChrist declared that the divine in\ufb02uence of the Spirit was to be with\nHis followers unto the end. But the promise is not appreciated as it should\nbe; and therefore its ful\ufb01llment is not seen as it might be. The promise\nof the Spirit is a matter little thought of; and the result is only what might\nbe expected,\u2014spiritual drouth, spiritual darkness, spiritual declension and\ndeath. Minor matters occupy the attention, and the divine power which is\nnecessary for the growth and prosperity of the church, and which would\nbring all other blessings in its train, is lacking, though offered in its in\ufb01nite\nplenitude.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:21.\nSome Idly Waiting for Season of Refreshing\nThere are some who, instead of wisely improving present opportunities,\nare idly waiting for some special season of spiritual refreshing by which their\nability to enlighten others will be greatly increased. They neglect present\nduties and privileges, and allow their light to burn dim, while they look\nforward to a time when, without any effort on their part, they will be made\nthe recipients of special blessing, by which they will be transformed and \ufb01tted\nfor service.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 54.\nChrist\u2019s Successor\nThe Holy Spirit is Christ\u2019s representative, but divested of the personality\nof humanity, and independent thereof. Cumbered with humanity, Christ could\nnot be in every place personally. Therefore it was for their interest that He\nshould go to the Father, and send the Spirit to be His successor on earth. No\none could then have any advantage because of his location or his personal\ncontact with Christ. By the Spirit the Saviour would be accessible to all. In this\nsense He would be nearer to them than if He had not ascended on high.\u2014 The\nDesire of Ages, 669.\n255\nHoly Spirit at Work from Beginning\nFrom the beginning God has been working by His Holy Spirit through\nhuman instrumentalities for the accomplishment of His purpose in behalf of\nthe fallen race. This was manifest in the lives of the patriarchs. To the church\nin the wilderness also, in the time of Moses, God gave His \u201cgood Spirit to\ninstruct them.\u201d And in the days of the apostles He wrought mightily for His\nchurch through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The same power that sustained\nthe patriarchs, that gave Caleb and Joshua faith and courage, and that made\nthe work of the apostolic church effective, has upheld God\u2019s faithful children\nin every succeeding age. It was through the power of the Holy Spirit that\nduring the Dark Ages the Waldensian Christians helped to prepare the way\nfor the Reformation. It was the same power that made successful the efforts\nof the noble men and women who pioneered the way for the establishment of\nmodern missions, and for the translation of the Bible into the languages and\ndialects of all nations and peoples.\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 53.\n256\nChap. 26 - Assurance of Success\nThe Divine Guaranty\nGod will do the work if we will furnish Him the instruments.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 9:107.\nGod will accept the whole-hearted service, and will Himself make up the\nde\ufb01ciencies.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 150.\nEvery deed of righteousness will be immortalized, although the doer may\nnot feel that he has done anything worthy of notice.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 2:683.\nIf you are truly consecrated, God will, through your instrumentality, bring\ninto the truth others whom He can use as channels to convey light to many that\nare groping in darkness.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church7:63.\nThe truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who now choose to be\nlaborers together with God will triumph with it.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church\n9:135.\nTo every one who offers himself to the Lord for service, withholding\nnothing, is given power for the attainment of measureless results.\u2014Testimonies\nfor the Church 7:30.\nWhen we labor diligently for the salvation of our fellow men, God will\nprosper our very effort.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:86.\nThe Lord has a place for every one in His great plan. Talents that are not\nneeded are not bestowed. Supposing that the talent is small. God has a place\nfor it, and that one talent, if faithfully used, will do the very work God designs\nthat it should do.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:37.\nThe humblest workers, in co-operation with Christ, may touch chords\nwhose vibrations shall ring to the ends of the earth, and make melody\nthroughout eternal ages.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 159.\nTrue success in any line of work is not the result of chance or accident\nor destiny. It is the outworking of God\u2019s providences, the reward of faith and\ndiscretion, of virtue and perseverance. Fine mental qualities and a high\n257\nmoral tone are not the result of accident. God gives opportunities; success\ndepends upon the use made of them.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 486.\nThose who are impressed to enter the work, whether in the home \ufb01eld or in\nthe regions beyond, are to go forward in the name of the Lord. If they depend\non God for grace and strength, they will succeed. At the beginning their work\nmay be small, but if they follow the Lord\u2019s plans, it will enlarge. God lives.\nHe will work for the unsel\ufb01sh, self-sacri\ufb01cing laborer, whoever and wherever\nhe may be.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, April 9, 1903.\nCo-operation of Heavenly Agencies\nWe need to understand better than we do the mission of the angels. It\nwould be well to remember that every true child of God has the co-operation\nof heavenly beings. Invisible armies of light and power attend the meek\nand lowly ones who believe and claim the promises of God. Cherubim\nand seraphim, and angels that excel in strength, stand at God\u2019s right hand,\n\u201call ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of\nsalvation.\u201d\u2014 The Acts of the Apostles, 154.\nRemember that the Lord Jesus is the Master Worker. He waters the seed\nsown. He puts into your minds words that will reach hearts.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:41.\nConsecrate yourselves wholly to the work of God. He is your strength,\nand He will be at your right hand, helping you to carry on His merciful\ndesigns.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:41.\nThe heavenly intelligences will work with the human agent who seeks with\ndetermined faith that perfection of character which will reach out to perfection\nin action. To every one engaged in this work Christ says, I am at your right\nhand to help you.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 332.\nAs the will of man co-operates with the will of God, it becomes\nomnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command, may be accomplished in\nHis strength. All His biddings are enablings.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 333.\n258\nIn working for perishing souls, you have the companionship of angels.\nThousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thousand angels are\nwaiting to co-operate with members of our churches in communicating the\nlight that God has generously given, that a people may be prepared for the\ncoming of Christ.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:129.\nIn this work all the angels of heaven are ready to co-operate. All the\nresources of heaven are at the command of those who are seeking to save the\nlost. Angels will help you to reach the most careless and the most hardened.\nAnd when one is brought back to God, all heaven is made glad; seraphs\nand cherubs touch their golden harps, and sing praises to God and the Lamb\nfor their mercy and loving-kindness to the children of men.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 197.\nHe who called the \ufb01shermen of Galilee is still calling men to His service.\nAnd He is just as willing to manifest His power through us as through the \ufb01rst\ndisciples. However imperfect and sinful we may be, the Lord holds out to us\nthe offer of partnership with Himself, of apprenticeship to Christ. He invites\nus to come under the divine instruction, that, uniting with Christ, we may work\nthe works of God.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 297.\nThink you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him? Think\nyou not that He visits those who, like the beloved John, are for His sake in\nhard and trying places? He \ufb01nds His faithful ones, and holds communion with\nthem, encouraging and strengthening them. And angels of God, that excel\nin strength, are sent forth by God to minister to His human workers who are\nspeaking the truth to those who know it not.\u2014Testimonies for the Church8:17.\nAll Heaven is in activity, and the angels of God are waiting to co-operate\nwith all who will devise plans whereby souls for whom Christ died may hear\nthe glad tidings of salvation. Angels who minister to those that shall be heirs\nof salvation, are saying to every true saint, \u201cThere is work for you to do.\u201d \u201cGo,\nstand and speak ... to the people all the words of this life.\u201d Acts 5:20. If those\naddressed would obey this injunction, the Lord would prepare the way\n259\nbefore them, putting them in possession of means wherewith to\ngo.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:433, 434.\nIn such a time as this, every child of God should be actively engaged in\nhelping others. As those who have an understanding of Bible truth try to seek\nout the men and women who are longing for light, angels of God will attend\nthem. And where angels go, none need fear to move forward. As a result of\nthe faithful efforts of consecrated workers, many will be turned from idolatry\nto the worship of the living God. Many will cease to pay homage to manmade\ninstitutions, and will take their stand fearlessly on the side of God and His\nlaw.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 171.\nThe principalities and powers of heaven are watching the warfare which,\nunder apparently discouraging circumstances, God\u2019s servants are carrying on.\nNew conquests are being achieved, new honors won, as the Christians, rallying\nround the banner of their Redeemer, go forth to \ufb01ght the good \ufb01ght of faith.\nAll the heavenly angels are at the service of the humble, believing people of\nGod; and as the Lord\u2019s army of workers here below sing their songs of praise,\nthe choir above join with them in ascribing praise to God and to His Son.\u2014The\nActs of the Apostles, 154.\nIt is not the power that emanates from men that makes the work successful,\nit is the power of the heavenly intelligences working with the human agent\nthat brings the work to perfection. A Paul may plant, and an Apollos may\nwater, but it is God that giveth the increase. Man cannot do God\u2019s part of the\nwork. As a human agent he may cooperate with the divine intelligences, and\nin simplicity and meekness do his best, realizing that God is the great Master\nWorkman. Although the workmen may be buried, the work will not cease, but\nit will go on to completion.\u2014 The Review and Herald, November 14, 1893.\nThe Christian always has a strong helper in the Lord. The way of the\nLord\u2019s helping we may not know; but this we do know: He will never fail\nthose who put their trust in Him. Could Christians realize how many times the\nLord has ordered their way, that the purposes of the\n260\nenemy concerning them might not be accomplished, they would not stumble\nalong complainingly. Their faith would be stayed on God, and no trial would\nhave power to move them. They would acknowledge Him as their wisdom\nand ef\ufb01ciency, and He would bring to pass that which He desires to work out\nthrough them.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 576.\nAll who engage in ministry are God\u2019s helping hand. They are coworkers\nwith the angels; rather, they are the human agencies through whom the angels\naccomplish their mission. Angels speak through their voices, and work by\ntheir hands. And the human workers, co-operating with heavenly agencies,\nhave the bene\ufb01t of their education and experience.\u2014 Education, 271.\nChrist calls every man and woman to put on the armor of His righteousness\nand begin to work. \u201cI am at your right hand to help you,\u201d He declares. Tell all\nyour trials and perplexities to your God. He will never betray your con\ufb01dence.\nThere is nothing so precious to Christ as His purchased possession, His church,\nthe workers who go forth to scatter the seeds of truth.... Think of Jesus. He\nis in His holy place, not in a state of solitude, but surrounded by ten thousand\ntimes ten thousand of heavenly angels who wait to do His bidding. And\nHe bids them go and work for the weakest saint who puts his trust in God.\nHigh and low, rich and poor, have the same help provided.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, November 7, 1905.\nThere Should Be No Thought of Failure\nWorkers for Christ are never to think, much less to speak, of failure in\ntheir work. The Lord Jesus is our ef\ufb01ciency in all things; His Spirit is to be\nour inspiration; and as we place ourselves in His hands, to be channels of\nlight, our means of doing good will never be exhausted. We may draw upon\nHis fulness, and receive of that grace which has no limit.\u2014 Gospel Workers,\n19.\nWhen we give ourselves wholly to God, and in our work follow His\ndirections, He makes Himself responsible for its accomplishment. He would\nnot have us conjecture as to the success of our honest endeavors. Not once\nshould we\n261\neven think of failure. We are to co-operate with One who knows no\nfailure.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 363.\nThe Lord is disappointed when His people place a low estimate upon\nthemselves. He desires His chosen heritage to value themselves according\nto the price He has placed upon them. God wanted them, else He would not\nhave sent His Son on such an expensive errand to redeem them. He has a use\nfor them, and He is well pleased when they make the very highest demands\nupon Him, that they may glorify His name. They may expect large things if\nthey have faith in His promises.\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 668.\nProportionate Success\nWhen God opens the way for the accomplishment of a certain work, and\ngives assurance of success, the chosen instrumentality must do all in his\npower to bring about the promised result. In proportion to the enthusiasm\nand perseverance with which the work is carried forward, will be the success\ngiven.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 263.\nThe Underlying Motive in Successful Service\nWhatsoever is done out of pure love, be it ever so little or contemptible in\nthe sight of men, is wholly fruitful; for God regards more with how much love\none worketh, than the amount he doeth.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:135.\nTen truly converted, willing-minded, unsel\ufb01sh workers can do more in the\nmissionary \ufb01eld than one hundred who con\ufb01ne their efforts to set forms, and\npreserve mechanical rules, working without deep love for souls.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 4:602.\nIt is not the capabilities you now possess, or ever will have, that will give\nyou success. It is that which the Lord can do for you. We need to have far\nless con\ufb01dence in what man can do, and far more con\ufb01dence in what God can\ndo for every believing soul. He longs to have you reach after Him by faith.\nHe longs to have you expect great things from Him. He longs to give you\nunderstanding in temporal as well as in spiritual matters. He can sharpen the\nintellect. He can give tact and skill. Put your talents into the work,\n262\nask God for wisdom, and it will be given to you.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n146.\nThe oil of grace gives to men the courage, and supplies to them the\nmotives, for doing every day the work that God appoints to them. The \ufb01ve\nfoolish virgins had lamps (this means a knowledge of Scripture truth), but\nthey had not the grace of Christ. Day by day they went through a round of\nceremonies and external duties, but their service was lifeless, devoid of the\nrighteousness of Christ. The Sun of Righteousness did not shine in their hearts\nand minds, and they had not the love of the truth which conforms to the life\nand character, the image and superscription, of Christ. The oil of grace was\nnot mingled with their endeavors. Their religion was a dry husk without the\ntrue kernel. They held fast to forms of doctrines, but they were deceived in\ntheir Christian life, full of self-righteousness, and failing to learn lessons in\nthe school of Christ, which, if practiced, would have made them wise unto\nsalvation.\u2014 The Review and Herald, March 27, 1894.\nThe work of God is to be carried on to completion by the co-operation of\ndivine and human agencies. Those who are self-suf\ufb01cient may be apparently\nactive in the work of God; but if they are prayerless, their activity is of no\navail. Could they look into the censer of the angel that stands at the golden\naltar before the rainbow-circled throne, they would see that the merit of Jesus\nmust be mingled with our prayers and efforts, or they are as worthless as was\nthe offering of Cain. Could we see all the activity of human instrumentality,\nas it appears before God, we would see that only the work accomplished by\nmuch prayer, which is sancti\ufb01ed by the merit of Christ, will stand the test\nof the judgment. When the grand review shall take place, then shall ye return\nand discern between him that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, July 4, 1893.\nLegal religion will not answer for this age. We may perform all the\noutward acts of service, and yet be as destitute of the quickening in\ufb02uence\nof the Holy Spirit as\n263\nthe hills of Gilboa were destitute of dew and rain. We all need spiritual\nmoisture; and we need also the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness\nto soften and subdue our hearts. We are always to be as \ufb01rm as a rock\nto principle. Bible principles are to be taught, and then backed up by holy\npractice.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:417, 418.\nSuccess depends not so much on talent as on energy and willingness. It\nis not the possession of splendid talents that enables us to render acceptable\nservice; but the conscientious performance of daily duties, the contented spirit,\nthe unaffected, sincere interest in the welfare of others. In the humblest lot\ntrue excellence may be found. The commonest tasks, wrought with loving\nfaithfulness, are beautiful in God\u2019s sight.\u2014 Prophets and Kings, 219.\nThe symmetrical structure of a strong, beautiful character is built up by\nindividual acts of duty. And faithfulness should characterize our life in the\nleast as well as in the greatest of its details. Integrity in little things, the\nperformance of little acts of \ufb01delity and little deeds of kindness, will gladden\nthe path of life; and when our work on earth is ended, it will be found that\nevery one of the little duties faithfully performed has exerted an in\ufb02uence for\ngood,\u2014an in\ufb02uence that can never perish.\u2014 Patriarchs and Prophets, 574.\nLeave Results with God\nThe good seed may for a time lie unnoticed in a cold, sel\ufb01sh, worldly\nheart, giving no evidence that it has taken root; but afterward, as the Spirit of\nGod breathes on the soul, the hidden seed springs up, and at last bears fruit\nto the glory of God. In our life-work we know not which shall prosper, this\nor that. This is not a question for us to settle. We are to do our work, and\nleave the results with God. \u201cIn the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening\nwithhold not thine hand.\u201d God\u2019s great covenant declares that \u201cwhile the earth\nremaineth, seed-time and harvest ... shall not cease.\u201d In the con\ufb01dence of this\npromise the husbandman tills and sows. Not less con\ufb01dently are we in the\nspiritual sowing to labor, trusting His assurance, \u201cSo shall\n264\nMy word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return unto Me\nvoid, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the\nthing whereto I sent it.\u201d \u201cHe that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious\nseed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with\nhim.\u201d\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 65.\n265\nChap. 27 - Reward of Service\nPriceless\nIt is not a vain thing to serve God. There is a priceless reward for those\nwho devote their life to His service.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:107.\nEvery sacri\ufb01ce that is made in His ministry will be recompensed according\nto \u201cthe exceeding riches of His grace.\u201d\u2014 The Desire of Ages, 249.\nOur reward for working with Christ in this world is the greater power and\nwider privilege of working with Him in the world to come.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 361.\nBasis of Valuation\nThe value of service to God is measured by the spirit in which it is\nrendered, rather than by the length of time spent in labor.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 9:74.\nTheir success in advancement in the divine life depends upon the\nimprovement of the talents lent them. Their future reward will be proportioned\nto the integrity and earnestness with which they serve the Master.\u2014 The\nReview and Herald, March 1, 1887.\nThe Lord has a great work to be done, and He will bequeath the most in\nthe future life to those who do the most faithful, willing service in the present\nlife.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 330.\nThose who came into the vineyard at the eleventh hour were thankful for\nan opportunity to work. Their hearts were full of gratitude to the one who had\naccepted them; and when at the close of the day the householder paid them for\na full day\u2019s work, they were greatly surprised. They knew they had not earned\nsuch wages. And the kindness expressed in the countenance of their employer\n\ufb01lled them with joy. They never forgot the goodness of the householder, or\nthe generous compensation they had received.\n266\nThus it is with the sinner, who, knowing his unworthiness, has entered the\nMaster\u2019s vineyard at the eleventh hour. His time of service seems so short,\nhe feels that he is undeserving of reward; but he is \ufb01lled with joy that God\nhas accepted him at all. He works with a humble, trusting spirit, thankful\nfor the privilege of being a coworker with Christ. This spirit God delights to\nhonor.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 397, 398.\nSure Reward\nHe who has appointed \u201cto every man his work,\u201d according to his ability,\nwill never let the faithful performance of duty go unrewarded. Every act\nof loyalty and faith will be crowned with special tokens of God\u2019s favor and\napprobation. To every worker is given the promise, \u201cHe that goeth forth and\nweepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing,\nbringing his sheaves with him.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church5:395.\nHowever short our service or humble our work, if in simple faith we follow\nChrist, we shall not be disappointed of the reward. That which even the\ngreatest and wisest cannot earn, the weakest and most humble may receive.\nHeaven\u2019s golden gate opens not to the self-exalted. It is not lifted up to the\nproud in spirit. But the everlasting portals will open wide to the trembling\ntouch of a little child. Blessed will be the recompense of grace to those who\nhave wrought for God in the simplicity of faith and love.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 404.\nThe brows of those who do this work will wear the crown of sacri\ufb01ce. But\nthey will receive their reward.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:348.\nTo every worker for God this thought should be a stimulus and an\nencouragement. In this life our work for God often seems to be almost\nfruitless. Our efforts to do good may be earnest and persevering, yet we may\nnot be permitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be\nlost. But the Saviour assures us that our work is noted in heaven, and that the\nrecompense cannot fail.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:305.\n267\nEvery act, every deed of justice and mercy and benevolence, makes music\nin heaven. The Father from His throne beholds and numbers the performer of\nthem with His most precious treasures. \u201cAnd they shall be Mine, saith the Lord\nof hosts, when I make up My jewels.\u201d Every merciful act to the needy or the\nsuffering is as though done to Jesus. Whoever succors the poor, or sympathizes\nwith the af\ufb02icted and oppressed, and befriends the orphan, brings himself into\na more close relationship to Jesus.\u2014 The Review and Herald, August 16, 1881.\nChrist regards all acts of mercy, benevolence, and thoughtful consideration\nfor the unfortunate, the blind, the lame, the sick, the widow, and the orphan, as\ndone to Himself; and these works are preserved in the heavenly records, and\nwill be rewarded.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:512, 513.\nA Just Reward\nThe Lord is good. He is merciful and tender-hearted. He is acquainted\nwith every one of His children. He knows just what each one of us is doing.\nHe knows just how much credit to give to each one. Will you not lay down\nyour credit list and your condemnation list, and leave God to do His own\nwork? You will be given the crown of glory if you will attend to the work that\nGod has given you.\u2014 The Southern Watchman, May 14, 1903.\nThe Lord desires us to rest in Him without a question as to our measure\nof reward. When Christ abides in the soul, the thought of reward is not\nuppermost. This is not the motive that actuates our service.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons, 398.\nFrom garrets, from hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from\nmountains and deserts, from the caves of the earth and the caverns of the sea,\nChrist will gather His children to Himself. On earth they have been destitute,\naf\ufb02icted, and tormented. Millions have gone down to the grave loaded with\ninfamy because they refused to yield to the deceptive claims of Satan. By\nhuman tribunals the children of God have been adjudged the vilest criminals.\nBut the day is near when \u201cGod is judge Himself.\u201d Then the decisions of earth\nshall be reversed. \u201cThe rebuke of\n268\nHis people shall He take away.\u201d White robes will be given to every one\nof them. And \u201cthey shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the\nLord.\u201d\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 179, 180.\nPresent Reward\nHappiness\u2014Those who give their lives to Christlike ministry know the\nmeaning of true happiness. Their interests and their prayers reach far beyond\nself. They themselves are growing as they try to help others. They become\nfamiliar with the largest plans, the most stirring enterprises, and how can\nthey but grow when they place themselves in the divine channel of light and\nblessing? Such ones receive wisdom from heaven. They become more and\nmore identi\ufb01ed with Christ in all His plans. There is no opportunity for\nspiritual stagnation.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:42.\nThe church that engages successfully in this work, is a happy church. That\nman or that woman whose soul is drawn out in compassion and love for the\nerring, and who labors to bring them to the fold of the great Shepherd, is\nengaged in a blessed work. And, oh, what a soul-enrapturing thought, that\nwhen one sinner is thus reclaimed, there is more joy in heaven than over ninety\nand nine just persons!\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:22.\nNothing is drudgery to the one who submits to the will of God. \u201cDoing it\nunto the Lord\u201d is a thought that throws a charm over whatever work God gives\nhim to do.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:150.\nThe Christian laborer knows no drudgery in his heaven-appointed work.\nHe enters into the joy of His Lord in seeing souls emancipated from the\nslavery of sin; and this joy repays him for every self-denial.\u2014 The Southern\nWatchman, April 2, 1903.\nTo become a toiler, to continue patiently in well-doing which\ncalls for self-denying labor, is a glorious work, which Heaven smiles\nupon.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:24.\nChrist delights to take apparently hopeless material, those whom Satan has\ndebased and through whom he has worked and make them the subjects of His\ngrace.... He makes His\n269\nchildren His agents in the accomplishment of his work, and in its success, even\nin this life, they \ufb01nd a precious reward.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church 6:308,\n309.\nBlessing\u2014Every effort made for Christ will react in blessing upon\nourselves.\u2014 Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 354.\nEvery duty performed, every sacri\ufb01ce made in the name of Jesus, brings\nan exceeding great reward. In the very act of duty, God speaks, and gives His\nblessing.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:145.\nWe should live in this world to win souls to the Saviour. If we injure others,\nwe injure ourselves also. If we bless others, we also bless ourselves; for the\nin\ufb02uence of every good deed is re\ufb02ected upon our own hearts.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 4:72.\nEvery ray of light shed upon others will be re\ufb02ected upon our own hearts.\nEvery kind and sympathizing word spoken to the sorrowful, every act to\nrelieve the oppressed, and every gift to supply the necessities of our fellow\nbeings, given or done with an eye to God\u2019s glory, will result in blessings to\nthe giver. Those who are thus working are obeying a law of heaven, and will\nreceive the approval of God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:56.\nWhile the great \ufb01nal reward is given at Christ\u2019s coming, true-hearted\nservice for God brings a reward, even in this life. Obstacles, opposition,\nand bitter, heartbreaking discouragements, the worker will have to meet. He\nmay not see the fruit of his toil. But in face of all this he \ufb01nds in his labor\na blessed recompense. All who surrender themselves to God in unsel\ufb01sh\nservice for humanity are in cooperation with the Lord of glory. This thought\nsweetens all toil, it braces the will, it nerves the spirit for whatever may\nbefall.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:305, 306.\nHealth\u2014Doing good is an excellent remedy for disease. Those who\nengage in the work are invited to call upon God, and He has pledged Himself\nto answer them. Their soul shall be satis\ufb01ed in drouth, and they shall be like a\nwatered garden, whose waters fail not.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:29.\n270\nIn fellowship with God, with Christ, and with holy angels, they are\nsurrounded with a heavenly atmosphere, an atmosphere that brings health\nto the body, vigor to the intellect, and joy to the soul.\u2014 Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:306.\nThe pleasure of doing good to others imparts a glow to the feelings which\n\ufb02ashes through the nerves, quickens the circulation of the blood, and induces\nmental and physical health.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church4:56.\nStrength\u2014Let a strong man be shut away from labor, and he becomes\nfeeble. That church or those persons who shut themselves away from bearing\nburdens for others, who shut themselves up to themselves, will soon suffer\nspiritual feebleness. It is labor that keeps the strong man strong. And spiritual\nlabor, toil, and burden-bearing, is what will give strength to the church of\nChrist.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:22.\nPeace\u2014In doing for others, a sweet satisfaction will be experienced, an\ninward peace which will be a suf\ufb01cient reward. When actuated by a high\nand noble desire to do others good, they will \ufb01nd true happiness in a faithful\ndischarge of life\u2019s manifold duties. This will bring more than an earthly\nreward; for every faithful, unsel\ufb01sh performance of duty is noticed by the\nangels, and shines in the life record.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church2:132.\nFuture Reward\nEternal Life\u2014By earnest, thoughtful efforts to help where help is needed,\nthe true Christian shows his love for God and for his fellow beings. He may\nlose his life in service; but when Christ comes to gather His jewels to Himself,\nhe will \ufb01nd it again.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church9:56.\nA Gracious Welcome Home\u2014Stand on the threshold of eternity, and hear\nthe gracious welcome given to those who in this life have co-operated with\nChrist, regarding it as a privilege and an honor to suffer for His sake.... There\nthe redeemed ones greet those who directed them to the uplifted Saviour. They\nunite in praising Him who died that human beings might have the life that\nmeasures with the life of God. The con\ufb02ict is over. All tribulation and strife\nare at an end. Songs of victory \ufb01ll all heaven, as the\n271\nredeemed stand around the throne of God. All take up the joyful strain,\n\u201cWorthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain,\u201d and hath redeemed us to\nGod.\u2014 The Ministry of Healing, 506, 507.\nIf the record shows that this has been their life, that their characters have\nbeen marked with tenderness, self-denial, and benevolence, they will receive\nthe blessed assurance and benediction from Christ, \u201cWell done.\u201d \u201cCome,\nye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the\nfoundation of the world.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church3:525.\nHeavenly Environment \u2014Now the church is militant. Now we are\nconfronted with a world in darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry.\nBut the day is coming when the battle will have been fought, the victory won.\nThe will of God is to be done on earth as it is done in heaven. The nations of\nthe saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All will be a happy,\nunited family, clothed with the garments of praise and thanksgiving,\u2014the robe\nof Christ\u2019s righteousness. All nature, in its surpassing loveliness, will offer to\nGod a tribute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light\nof heaven. The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light\nof the sun will be sevenfold greater than it is now. The years will move on in\ngladness. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, and the sons of\nGod will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in proclaiming, \u201cThere\nshall be no more sin, neither shall there be any more death.\u201d\u2014 The Ministry of\nHealing, 504.\nJoy\u2014It is the reward of Christ\u2019s workers to enter into His joy. That joy,\nto which Christ Himself looks forward with eager desire, is presented in His\nrequest to His Father, \u201cI will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be\nwith Me where I am.\u201d\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:309.\nIn our life here, earthly, sin-restricted, though it is, the greatest joy and\nthe highest education are in service. And in the future state, untrammeled by\nthe limitations of sinful humanity, it is in service that our greatest joy and our\nhighest education will be found,\u2014witnessing, and ever as\n272\nwe witness learning anew \u201cthe riches of the glory of this mystery,\u201d \u201cwhich is\nChrist in you, the hope of glory.\u201d\u2014 Education, 309.\nThey share in the sufferings of Christ, and they will share also in the glory\nthat shall be revealed. One with Him in His work, drinking with Him the cup\nof sorrow, they are partakers also of His joy.\u2014 Thoughts from the Mount of\nBlessing, 12.\nFruitage of Seed-Sowing\u2014Every impulse of the Holy Spirit leading men\nto goodness and to God, is noted in the books of heaven, and in the day of\nGod every one who has given himself as an instrument for the Holy Spirit\u2019s\nworking will be permitted to behold what his life has wrought.\u2014 Testimonies\nfor the Church 6:310.\nWhen the redeemed stand before God, precious souls will respond to their\nnames who are there because of the faithful, patient efforts put forth in their\nbehalf, the entreaties and earnest persuasions to \ufb02ee to the Stronghold. Thus\nthose who in this world have been laborers together with God will receive their\nreward.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church8:196, 197.\nWhat rejoicing there will be as these redeemed ones meet and greet those\nwho have had a burden in their behalf! And those who have lived, not to\nplease themselves, but to be a blessing to the unfortunate who have so few\nblessings,\u2014how their hearts will thrill with satisfaction! They will realize the\npromise, \u201cThou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou\nshalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\u201d\u2014 Gospel Workers, 519.\nIn heaven we shall see the youth whom we helped, those whom we\ninvited to our homes, whom we led from temptation. We shall see their faces\nre\ufb02ecting the radiance of the glory of God.\u2014 Testimonies for the Church6:348.\nTo be a coworker with Christ and the heavenly angels in the great plan of\nsalvation! What work can bear any comparison with this! From every soul\nsaved, there comes to God a revenue of glory, to be re\ufb02ected upon the one\nsaved, and also upon the one instrumental in his salvation.\u2014 Testimonies for\nthe Church 2:232.\n273\nThe redeemed will meet and recognize those whose attention they have\ndirected to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed converse they will have with\nthese souls! \u201cI was a sinner,\u201d it will be said, \u201cwithout God and without hope in\nthe world; and you came to me, and drew my attention to the precious Saviour\nas my only hope. And I believed in Him. I repented of my sins, and was made\nto sit together with His saints in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.\u201d Others will\nsay: \u201cI was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your friends and comfortable\nhome, and came to teach me how to \ufb01nd Jesus, and believe in Him as the only\ntrue God. I demolished my idols, and worshiped God, and now I see Him\nface to face. I am saved, eternally saved, ever to behold Him whom I love. I\nthen saw Him only with the eye of faith, but now I see Him as He is. I can\nnow express my gratitude for His redeeming mercy to Him who loved me, and\nwashed me from my sins in His own blood.\u201d\u2014 Gospel Workers, 518.\nOthers will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry and clothed\nthe naked. \u201cWhen despair bound my soul in unbelief, the Lord sent you to\nme,\u201d they say, \u201cto speak words of hope and comfort. You brought me food for\nmy physical necessities, and you opened to me the Word of God, awakening\nme to my spiritual needs. You treated me as a brother. You sympathized with\nme in my sorrows, and restored my bruised and wounded soul, so that I could\ngrasp the hand of Christ that was reached out to save me. In my ignorance you\ntaught me patiently that I had a Father in heaven who cared for me. You read\nto me the precious promises of God\u2019s Word. You inspired in me faith that He\nwould save me. My heart was softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated\nthe sacri\ufb01ce which Christ had made for me. I became hungry for the bread\nof life, and the truth was precious to my soul. I am here, saved, eternally\nsaved, ever to live in His presence, and to praise Him who gave His life for\nme.\u201d\u2014 Gospel Workers, 518, 519.\nPatiently Wait for the Reward\nIf the time seems long to wait for our Deliverer to come; if, bowed by\naf\ufb02iction and worn with toil, we feel impatient\n274\nfor our commission to close, and to receive an honorable release from\nthe warfare, let us remember\u2014and let the remembrance check every\nmurmur\u2014that God leaves us on earth to encounter storms and con\ufb02icts, to\nperfect Christian character, to become better acquainted with God our Father\nand Christ our Elder Brother, and to do work for the Master in winning many\nsouls to Christ, that with glad heart we may hear the words, \u201cWell done, good\nand faithful servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\u2014 The Review and\nHerald, October 25, 1881.\nBe patient, Christian soldier. Yet a little while, and He that shall come,\nwill come. The night of weary waiting, and watching, and mourning is nearly\nover. The reward will soon be given; the eternal day will dawn. There is no\ntime to sleep now,\u2014no time to indulge in useless regrets. He who ventures to\nslumber now will miss precious opportunities of doing good. We are granted\nthe blessed privilege of gathering sheaves in the great harvest; and every soul\nsaved will be an additional star in the crown of Jesus, our adorable Redeemer.\nWho is eager to lay off the armor, when by pushing the battle a little longer, he\nwill achieve new victories and gather new trophies for eternity?\u2014 The Review\nand Herald, October 25, 1881.\n275",
