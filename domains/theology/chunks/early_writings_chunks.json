changing times that a book lives on\nthrough a century in ever-increasing demand and takes its place in\ncurrent reading by the side of books dealing with present issues.\nYet such is the enviable record ofEarly Writings of Ellen G. White.\nThrough the years there have been many printings of the several\neditions. It now appears in a fifth American edition.\nThis popular little volume is rightly named, being a republication\nof the first three Ellen G. White books\u2014Christian Experience and\nViews of Mrs. E. G. White, First printed in 1851; A Supplement to\nExperience and Views, Issued in 1854; and Spiritual Gifts, V olume\nI, which appeared in 1858.\nThe wide and lasting popularity of Early Writings may be at-\ntributed to the unwaning desire to possess and study the messages\nof information and encouragement which came early to the Church\nthrough the prophetic gift.\nThe second printing of this matter was made in 1882 in two small\nvolumes\u2014Experience and Views and the Supplement comprising\nthe first, and Spiritual Gifts the second. As to certain additions to\nthe first of these original works and some slight editorial changes\nmade at that time, the publisher\u2019s preface states:\n\u201cFootnotes giving dates and explanations, and an appendix giv-\ning two very interesting dreams, which were mentioned but not\nrelated in the original work, will add to the value of this edition.\nAside from these, no changes from the original work have been\nmade in the present edition, except the occasional employment of a\nnew word, or a change in the construction of a sentence, to better [iv]\nexpress the idea, and no portion of the work has been omitted. No\nshadow of change has been made in any idea or sentiment of the\noriginal work, and the verbal changes have been made under the\nauthor\u2019s own eye, and with her full approval.\u201d\nThe two companion books were also reissued as a single volume\nin 1882 under the title Early Writings. In 1906 the type was reset to\nv\nvi Early Writings\nmake the third American edition, which has had wide distribution,\nmeeting the ever-increasing demand. The paging of this edition\nbecame the standard for all reference work and the subsequently\npublished indexes to the writings of Mrs. White.\nThe fourth edition of Early Writings was published in 1945.\nForty years of printing and reprinting made necessary new printing\nplates. As the type was reset the content was held page for page\nwith the edition it succeeded. Modern spelling and current forms of\npunctuation were employed and a new preface reviewed briefly the\nhistory of the book.\nThis fifth edition is characterized by a historical prologue, added\nto furnish the reader with a knowledge of the times and circum-\nstances of the various portions of the book and by several appendix\nnotes provided to explain expressions and situations not so well\nunderstood now as at the time of writing. There has been no change\nof the E. G. White text nor change in the paging from the fourth\nedition which this succeeds, consequently it harmonizes with the\nComprehensive Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White.\nIn Experience and Views is presented Mrs. White\u2019s first bio-\ngraphical sketch, briefly tracing her experience through the Advent\nmovement of 1840-44. Then follow a number of the earlier visions,\nmany of which had first appeared in print in broadside or periodical\narticle form.\nThe Supplement Explains certain expressions of the earlier work[v]\nwhich had been misunderstood or misconstrued, and gives additional\ncounsel to the Church. Its publication preceded by one year the first\npamphlet bearing the title of Testimony for the Church.\nSpiritual Gifts, V olume I, being the first published account of the\nlong-extended conflict between Christ and His angels and Satan and\nhis angels, is cherished for its vivid descriptions and its compactness,\ntouching as it does only the more salient points. In succeeding years\nthis brief story of the conflict was greatly amplified in the four\nvolumes of The Spirit of Prophecy, Published 1870-84. After wide\ndistribution, this four-book set was replaced by the well-known and\nwidely read Conflict of the Ages series, presenting the account in\nstill more detailed form, as it had been presented to Mrs. White in\nmany revelations. Even though the fuller volumes\u2014Patriarchs and\nProphets, Prophets and Kings, The Desire of Ages, The Acts of the\nPreface vii\nApostles, and The Great Controversy\u2014Present the conflict story in\nits more complete form, the initial writing of the account as here\npresented in its brief, clear-cut, simple form, will, with Experience\nand Views, always be in large demand.\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications.\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch, 1963\nPreface to First Edition of \u201cExperience and Views\u201d\nWe are well aware that many honest seekers after truth and\nBible holiness are prejudiced against visions. Two great causes have\ncreated this prejudice. First fanaticism, accompanied by false visions\nand exercises, has existed more or less almost everywhere. This has [vi]\nled many of the sincere to doubt anything of the kind. Secondly,\nthe exhibition of mesmerism, and what is commonly called the\n\u201cmysterious rapping,\u201d are perfectly calculated to deceive, and create\nunbelief relative to the gifts and operations of the Spirit of God.\nBut God is unchangeable. His work through Moses in the pres-\nence of Pharaoh was perfect, notwithstanding Jannes and Jambres\nwere permitted to perform miracles by the power of Satan, that\nresembled the miracles wrought by Moses. The counterfeit also\nappeared in the days of the apostles, yet the gifts of the Spirit were\nmanifested in the followers of Christ. And it is not the purpose of\nGod to leave His people in this age of almost unbounded deception\nwithout the gifts and manifestations of His Spirit.\nThe design of a counterfeit is to imitate an existing reality. There-\nfore the present manifestation of the spirit of error is proof that God\nmanifests Himself to His children by the power of the Holy Spirit,\nand that He is about to fulfill His word gloriously.\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour\nout of My Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and daughters shall\nprophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men\nshall dream dreams.\u201d Acts 2:17 (CF. Joel 2:28.)\nviii Early Writings\nAs for mesmerism, we have ever considered it dangerous, there-\nfore have had nothing to do with it. We never even saw a person in a\nmesmeric sleep and know nothing of the art by experience.\nWe send out this little work with the hope that it will comfort the\nsaints.\nJames White.\nSaratoga Springs, N.Y.,\nAugust, 1851.\nHistorical Prologue[vii]\nEarly Writings is a work of lasting and special interest to Sev-\nenth-day Adventists, for it embodies the earliest Ellen G. White\nbooks. These were written and first published in the 1850\u2019s for the\nedification and instruction of those who with the author had passed\nthrough the experiences of the Sabbathkeeping Adventists in the\n1840\u2019s and the early 1850\u2019s. This being so, the author assumed\non the part of the reader a familiarity with the history of the Ad-\nvent Awakening and the development of the Seventh-day Adventist\nmovement that emerged in 1844. Consequently experiences well\nunderstood at the time are in some instances merely alluded to, and\nexpressions are employed which to be correctly understood, must\nbe thought of in the framework of the history of the Sabbathkeeping\nAdventists in those early years.\nIn 1858, in writing of the sounding of the messages of the three\nangels of Revelation 14, Ellen White deals with the experiences of\nthose who participated in the work and draws lessons from these\nexperiences, rather than giving as one might expect, a clear-cut\npresentation of the character of these messages. See pages 232-\n240; 254-258. She at times employs such now unfamiliar terms as\n\u201cnominal Adventist,\u201d \u201cshut door,\u201d \u201copen door,\u201d et cetera.\nToday we are removed by more than a century from those heroic\ntimes. The reader must keep this clearly in mind. The history which\nwas so well known to the contemporaries of Ellen White we shall\nnow review, touching some of the high points of the experiences of\nPreface ix\nthe Sabbathkeeping Adventists during the decade or two preceding\nthe first publication of the materials that appear here.\nIn the opening paragraphs Mrs. White makes brief reference to [viii]\nher conversion and her early Christian experience. She tells also\nof hearing lectures on the Bible doctrine of the expected personal\nadvent of Christ, which was thought to be near at hand. The great\nAdvent Awakening to which such brief reference is here made was\na movement worldwide in its outreach. It emerged as the result of\ncareful study of the prophetic scriptures on the part of many, and\nthe acceptance of the good news of the coming of Jesus by large\nnumbers of people throughout the world.\nThe Great Advent Awakening\nBut it was in the United States that the Advent message was most\nwidely proclaimed and received. As Bible prophecies relating to\nthe return of Jesus were accepted by able men and women of many\nreligious faiths, a large following of earnest Adventist believers\nresulted. It should be noted, however, that no separate and distinct\nreligious organization was formed. The Advent hope led to deep\nreligious revivals that benefited all the Protestant churches and led\nmany skeptics and infidels to publicly confess their faith in the Bible\nand in God.\nAs the movement neared its high point in the early 1840\u2019s, several\nhundred ministers united in proclaiming the message. In the lead\nwas William Miller, who lived in the eastern edge of New York\nState. He was a man of prominence in his community and engaged\nin farming as a livelihood. In spite of a rich religious background, he\nhad grown skeptical in his youth. He lost faith in the Word of God\nand adopted deistic views. While reading a sermon in the Baptist\nChurch one Sunday morning, the Holy Spirit touched his heart, and\nhe was led to accept Jesus Christ as his Saviour. Miller set about to\nstudy the Word of God, determined to find in the Bible a satisfactory [ix]\nanswer to all his questions, and to learn for himself the truths set\nforth in its pages.\nFor two years he devoted much of his time to a verse-by-verse\nstudy of the Scriptures. He determined not to take up the next verse\nuntil he felt he had found a satisfactory explanation of the one he\nx Early Writings\nwas studying. He had before him only his Bible and a concordance.\nIn time he came in his study to the prophecies of the literal, personal,\nsecond coming of Christ. He grappled also with the great time\nprophecies, particularly the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8 and 9,\nwhich he linked with the prophecy of Revelation 14 and the message\nof the angel proclaiming the hour of God\u2019s judgment (Revelation\n14:6, 7). In this volume, on page 229, Mrs. White states that \u201cGod\nsent His angel to move upon the heart\u201d of William Miller, \u201cto lead\nhim to search the prophecies.\u201d\nIn her girlhood Mrs. White heard Miller deliver two series of\nlectures in the city of Portland, Maine. A deep and lasting impression\nwas made on her heart. We will let her set before us the reckoning\nof the prophecies, as Elder Miller presented them to his audiences.\nFor this we turn to Mrs. White\u2019s later book, The Great Controversy:\nThe Reckoning of the Prophetic Periods\n\u201cThe prophecy which seemed most clearly to reveal the time of\nthe second advent was that of Daniel 8:14: \u2018Unto two thousand and\nthree hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\u2019 Following\nhis rule of making scripture its own interpreter, Miller learned that a\nday in symbolic prophecy represents a year [Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel\n4:6.]; He saw that the period of 2300 prophetic days, or literal\nyears, would extend far beyond the close of the Jewish dispensation,\nhence it could not refer to the sanctuary of that dispensation. Miller[x]\naccepted the generally received view, that in the Christian age the\nearth is the sanctuary, and he therefore understood that the cleansing\nof the sanctuary foretold in Daniel 8:14 represented the purification\nof the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ. If, then, the\ncorrect starting-point could be found for the 2300 days, he concluded\nthat the time of the second advent could be readily ascertained. Thus\nwould be revealed the time of that great consummation, the time\nwhen the present state, with \u2018all its pride and power, pomp and\nvanity, wickedness and oppression, would come to an end;\u2019 when\nthe curse would be \u2018removed from off the earth, death be destroyed,\nreward be given to the servants of God, the prophets and saints, and\nthem who fear his name, and those be destroyed that destroy the\nearth.\u2019 [Footnote: Bliss, Memoirs of Wm. Miller, 76.]\nPreface xi\n\u201cWith a new and deeper earnestness, Miller continued the exami-\nnation of the prophecies, whole nights as well as days being devoted\nto the study of what now appeared of such stupendous importance\nand all-absorbing interest. In the eighth chapter of Daniel he could\nfind no clue to the starting-point of the 2300 days; the angel Gabriel,\nthough commanded to make Daniel understand the vision, gave him\nonly a partial explanation. As the terrible persecution to befall the\nChurch was unfolded to the prophet\u2019s vision, physical strength gave\nway. He could endure no more, and the angel left him for a time.\nDaniel \u2018fainted, and was sick certain days.\u2019 \u2018And I was astonished at\nthe vision,\u2019 he says, \u2018but none understood it.\u2019\n\u201cYet God had bidden His messenger, \u2018make this man to under-\nstand the vision.\u2019 That commission must be fulfilled. In obedience\nto it, the angel, some time afterward, returned to Daniel, saying, \u2018I\nam now come forth to give thee skill and understanding;\u2019 \u2018therefore [xi]\nunderstand the matter, and consider the vision.\u2019 [Daniel 9:22, 23,\n25-27.] There was one important point in the vision of chapter eight\nwhich had been left unexplained, namely, that relating to time,\u2014\nthe period of the 2300 days; therefore the angel, in resuming his\nexplanation, dwells chiefly upon the subject of time:\n\u201c\u2018Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy\nholy city.... Know therefore and understand, that from the going\nforth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto\nthe Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and\ntwo weeks: The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in\ntroublous times. And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah\nbe cut off, but not for Himself.\n... And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week:\nAnd in the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the\noblation to cease.\u2019\n\u201cThe angel had been sent to Daniel for the express purpose of\nexplaining to him the point which he had failed to understand in the\nvision of the eighth chapter, the statement relative to time,\u2014\u2019unto\ntwo thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be\ncleansed.\u2019 After bidding Daniel \u2018understand the matter, and consider\nthe vision,\u2019 the very first words of the angel are, \u2018seventy weeks\nare determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city.\u2019 The word\nhere translated \u2018determined,\u2019 literally signifies \u2018cut off.\u2019 Seventy\nxii Early Writings\nweeks, representing 490 years, are declared by the angel to be cut\noff, as specially pertaining to the Jews. But from what were they\ncut off? As the 2300 days was the only period of time mentioned in\nchapter eight, it must be the period from which the seventy weeks\nwere cut off; the seventy weeks must therefore be a part of the\n2300 days, and the two periods must begin together. The seventy\nweeks were declared by the angel to date from the going forth of[xii]\nthe commandment to restore and build Jerusalem. If the date of this\ncommandment could be found, then the starting-point for the great\nperiod of the 2300 days would be ascertained.\n\u201cIn the seventh chapter of Ezra the decree is found. [Ezra 7:12-\n26.] In its completest form it was issued by Artaxerxes, king of\nPersia, B.C. 457. But in Ezra 6:14 the house of the Lord at Jerusalem\nis said to have been built \u2018according to the commandment [margin,\ndecree] of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.\u2019 These\nthree kings, in originating, re-affirming, and completing the decree,\nbrought it to the perfection required by the prophecy to mark the\nbeginning of the 2300 years. Taking B.C. 457, the time when\nthe decree was completed, as the date of the commandment, every\nspecification of the prophecy concerning the seventy weeks was seen\nto have been fulfilled.\n\u201c\u2018From the going forth of the commandment to restore and to\nbuild Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks,\nand threescore and two weeks.\u2019\u2014namely, sixty-nine weeks, or 483\nyears. The decree of Artaxerxes went into effect in the autumn of\nB.C. 457. From this date, 483 years extend to the autumn of A.D.\n27. At that time this prophecy was fulfilled. The word \u2018Messiah\u2019\nsignifies \u2018the Anointed One.\u2019 In the autumn of A.D. 27, Christ was\nbaptized by John, and received the anointing of the Spirit. The\napostle Peter testifies that \u2018God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with\nthe Holy Ghost and with power.\u2019 [Acts 10:38.] And the Saviour\nhimself declared, \u2018the Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He\nhath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.\u2019 [Luke 4:18.]\nAfter His baptism He went into Galilee, \u2018preaching the gospel of the\nkingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled.\u2019 [Mark 1:14, 15.]\n\u201c\u2018And He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week.\u2019[xiii]\nThe \u2018week\u2019 here brought to view is the last one of the seventy; it\nis the last seven years of the period allotted especially to the Jews.\nPreface xiii\nDuring this time, extending from A.D. 27 to A.D. 34, Christ, at\nfirst in person and afterward by His disciples, extended the gospel\ninvitation especially to the Jews. As the apostles went forth with\nthe good tidings of the kingdom, the Saviour\u2019s direction was, \u2018go\nnot into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans\nenter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\u2019\n[Matthew 10:5, 6.]\n\u201c\u2018In the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and the\noblation to cease.\u2019 In A.D. 31, three and a half years after His\nbaptism, our Lord was crucified. With the great sacrifice offered\nupon Calvary, ended that system of offerings which for four thousand\nyears had pointed forward to the Lamb of God. Type had met\nantitype, and all the sacrifices and oblations of the ceremonial system\nwere there to cease.\n\u201cThe seventy weeks, or 490 years, especially allotted to the Jews,\nended, as we have seen, in A.D. 34. At that time, through the action\nof the Jewish Sanhedrim, the nation sealed its rejection of the gospel\nby the martyrdom of Stephen and the persecution of the followers\nof Christ. Then the message of salvation, no longer restricted to\nthe chosen people, was given to the world. The disciples, forced\nby persecution to flee from Jerusalem, \u2018went everywhere preaching\nthe word.\u2019 \u2018Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached\nChrist unto them.\u2019 Peter, divinely guided, opened the gospel to the\ncenturion of Caesarea, the God-fearing Cornelius; and the ardent\nPaul, won to the faith of Christ, was commissioned to carry the glad\ntidings \u2018far hence unto the Gentiles.\u2019 [Acts 8:4, 5; Acts 22:21.]\n\u201cThus far every specification of the prophecies is strikingly ful- [xiv]\nfilled, and the beginning of the seventy weeks is fixed beyond ques-\ntion at B.C. 457, and their expiration in A.D. 34. From this data\nthere is no difficulty in finding the termination of the 2300 days. The\nseventy weeks\u2014490 days\u2014having been cut off from the 2300, there\nwere 1810 days remaining. After the end of 490 days, the 1810 days\nwere still to be fulfilled. From A.D. 34, 1810 years extend to 1844.\nConsequently the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14 terminate in 1844. At\nthe expiration of this great prophetic period, upon the testimony of\nthe angel of God, \u2018the sanctuary shall be cleansed.\u2019 Thus the time\nof the cleansing of the sanctuary\u2014which was almost universally\nxiv Early Writings\nbelieved to take place at the second advent\u2014was definitely pointed\nout.\n\u201cMiller and his associates at first believed that the 2300 days\nwould terminate in the spring of 1844, whereas the prophecy points\nto the autumn of that year. The misapprehension of this point brought\ndisappointment and perplexity to those who had fixed upon the\nearlier date as the time of the Lord\u2019s coming. But this did not in the\nleast affect the strength of the argument showing that the 2300 days\nterminated in the year 1844, and that the great event represented by\nthe cleansing of the sanctuary must then take place.\n\u201cEntering upon the study of the Scriptures as he had done, in\norder to prove that they were a revelation from God, Miller had not,\nat the outset, the slightest expectation of reaching the conclusion at\nwhich he had now arrived. He himself could hardly credit the results\nof his investigation. But the scripture evidence was too clear and\nforcible to be set aside.\n\u201cHe had devoted two years to the study of the Bible, when, in\n1818, he reached the solemn conviction that in about twenty-five\nyears Christ would appear for the redemption of His people.\u201d\u2014The[xv]\nGreat Controversy, 324-329.\nThe Disappointment and Its Aftermath\nIt was with keen anticipation that the Advent believers neared\nthe day of the expected return of their Lord. They saw the fall of\n1844 as the time to which the prophecy of Daniel pointed. But these\ndedicated believers were to suffer severe disappointment. As the\ndisciples of old failing to understand the exact character of events\nto take place in fulfillment of prophecy relating to the first advent\nof Jesus suffered disappointment, so the Adventists in 1844 were\ndisappointed concerning the development of prophecy relating to\nthe expected second coming of Christ. Of this, Ellen White wrote in\nthis volume:\n\u201cJesus did not come to the earth as the waiting, joyful company\nexpected, to cleanse the sanctuary by purifying the earth by fire. I\nsaw that they were correct in their reckoning of the prophetic periods;\nprophetic time closed in 1844, and Jesus entered the most holy place\nto cleanse the sanctuary at the ending of the days. Their mistake\nPreface xv\nconsisted in not understanding what the sanctuary was and the nature\nof its cleansing.\u201d\u2014Page 243.\nAlmost immediately following the disappointment of October\n22, many believers and ministers who had associated themselves\nwith the Advent message dropped away. Some of these joined\nthe movement largely from fear, and when the time of expectation\npassed, they abandoned their hope and disappeared. Others were\nswept into fanaticism. About half of the Adventist group clung\nto their confidence that Christ would soon appear in the clouds of\nheaven. In the experience of the derision and ridicule heaped upon\nthem by the world, they thought they saw evidences that the day of [xvi]\ngrace for the world had passed. These people believed firmly that the\nreturn of the Lord was very near. But as the days moved into weeks\nand the Lord did not appear, a division of opinion developed, and\nthis group divided. One part, numerically large, took the position\nthat prophecy was not fulfilled in 1844, and that there must have\nbeen a mistake in reckoning the prophetic periods. They began to fix\ntheir attention on some specific future date for the event. There were\nothers, a smaller group, the forefathers of the Seventh-day Adventist\nChurch, who were so certain of the evidences of the work of the\nspirit of God in the great Advent awakening that to deny that the\nmovement was the work of the Lord would, they believed, do despite\nto the spirit of grace. This they felt they could not do.\nA Vision Is Given to Ellen Harmon\nThe experience of this company of believers, and the work they\nwere to do, they found portrayed in the last verses of Revelation 10.\nThe Advent expectation was to be revived. God had led them. He\nwas still leading them. In their midst was a young woman, Ellen\nHarmon by name, who in December, 1844, barely two months after\nthe disappointment, received a prophetic revelation from God. In\nthis vision the Lord portrayed to her the travels of the Advent people\nto the New Jerusalem. While this vision did not explain the reason\nfor the Disappointment, which explanation could and did come from\nBible study, it gave them assurance that God was leading them and\nwould continue to lead them as they journeyed toward the heavenly\ncity.\nxvi Early Writings\nAt the beginning of the symbolic pathway revealed to youthful\nEllen was a bright light, identified by the angel as the midnight cry,\nan expression linked with the climactic preaching in the summer\nand autumn of 1844 of the imminent Second Advent. In this vision[xvii]\nshe saw Christ as leading the people to the city of God. Their\nconversation indicated that the journey would be longer than they\nhad anticipated. Some lost sight of Jesus and fell off the pathway,\nbut those who kept their eyes on Jesus and the city reached their\ndestination in safety. It is this that we find presented in \u201cMy First\nVision\u201d on pages 13-17.\nTwo Groups of Adventists\nAt first only a few were identified with this group who were\nmoving forward in advancing light. By the year 1846 they reckoned\ntheir numbers as about fifty.\nThe larger group who turned from confidence in the fulfillment\nof prophecy in 1844 numbered approximately thirty thousand. Their\nleaders came together in 1845 in a conference in Albany, New York,\nApril 29 to May 1, at which time they restudied their positions. By\nformal action they went on record as warning against those who\nclaim \u201cspecial illumination,\u201d those who teach \u201cJewish fables,\u201d and\nthose who establish \u201cnew tests\u201d ( Advent Herald, May 14, 1845).\nThus they closed the door to light on the Sabbath and the Spirit of\nProphecy. They were confident that prophecy had not been fulfilled\nin 1844, and some set time for the termination of the 2300-day\nperiod in the future. Various times were set, but one after another\nthey passed by. These people, held together by the cohesive element\nof the Advent hope, at first aligned themselves in several rather\nloosely knit groups with considerable variation in certain doctrinal\npositions. Some of these groups soon faded out. The group that\nsurvived became the Advent Christian Church. Such are identified\nin this book as the \u201cfirst day Adventists\u201d or \u201cnominal Adventists.\u201d\nDawn of the Light on the Sanctuary[xviii]\nBut we must now turn back to those who tenaciously clung to\ntheir confidence that prophecy had been fulfilled on October 22,\nPreface xvii\n1844, and who with open minds and hearts stepped forward into the\nSabbath and the sanctuary truths as the light of heaven illuminated\ntheir pathway. These people were not localized in any one place but\nwere individuals or very small groups here and there throughout the\nnorth central and north-eastern part of the United States.\nHiram Edson, one of this group, lived in central New York State\nat Port Gibson. He was the leader of the Adventists in that area.\nThe believers met in his home on October 22, 1844, to await the\ncoming of the Lord. Calmly and patiently they awaited the great\nevent. But as the hour of midnight came and they realized the day of\nexpectation had passed, it became clear that Jesus would not come\nas soon as they had thought. It was a time of bitter disappointment.\nIn the early morning hours Hiram Edson and a few others went out\nto his barn to pray, and as they prayed, he felt assured that light\nwould come.\nA little later, as Edson and a friend were crossing a cornfield to\nvisit fellow Adventists, it seemed as if a hand touched his shoulder.\nHe looked up to see\u2014as if in a vision\u2014the heavens opened, and\nChrist in the heavenly sanctuary entering into the most holy place,\nthere to begin a work of ministry in behalf of His people, instead of\ncoming forth from the most holy place to cleanse the world with fire,\nas they had taught. Careful Bible study by Hiram Edson; F. B. Hahn,\na physician; and O. R. L. Crozier, a schoolteacher, soon revealed\nthat the sanctuary to be cleansed at the end of the 2300 years was\nnot the earth but the tabernacle in heaven, with Christ ministering\nin our behalf in the most holy place. This mediatorial work of\nChrist answered to the \u201chour of God\u2019s judgment\u201d Call sounded in [xix]\nthe message of the first angel (Revelation 14:6, 7). Mr. Crozier,\nthe schoolteacher, wrote out the findings of the study group. These\nwere printed locally, and then in fuller form in an Adventist journal\nknown as the Day-Star, published in Cincinnati, Ohio. A special\nnumber dated February 7, 1846, was devoted entirely to this Bible\nstudy on the question of the sanctuary.\nTruths Confirmed by Vision\nWhile this study was in progress, and before their work was\nmade known, far to the east in the state of Maine, a vision was given\nxviii Early Writings\nto Ellen Harmon in which she was shown the transfer of the ministry\nof Christ from the holy place to the most holy place at the end of\nthe 2300 days. The record of this vision is found in Early Writings,\n54-56.\nOf another vision shortly after this, as referred to by Mrs. White\nin a statement written in April, 1847, she records that \u201cthe Lord\nshowed me in vision, more than one year ago, that Brother Crozier\nhad the true light on the cleansing of the sanctuary, etc.; and that it\nwas His will that Brother Crozier should write out the view which\nhe gave us in The Day-Star Extra, February 7, 1846. I feel fully\nauthorized by the Lord to recommend that extra to every saint.\u201d\u2014A\nWord to the Little Flock, 12. Thus the finding of Bible scholars was\nconfirmed by the visions of God\u2019s messenger.\nIn subsequent years Ellen White wrote a great deal concerning\nthe sanctuary truth and its significance to us, and there are many\nreferences to this in Early Writings. Note especially the chapter\nbeginning on page 250 entitled \u201cThe Sanctuary.\u201d The understanding\nof the ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary proved to be the\nkey that unlocked the mystery of the great Disappointment. Our\npioneers saw clearly that the prophecy announcing the hour of God\u2019s[xx]\njudgment at hand had its fulfillment in the events that took place in\n1844, but that there was a work of ministry to be accomplished in\nthe most holy place in the heavenly sanctuary before Jesus should\ncome to this earth.\nThe message of the first angel and the message of the second\nangel had been sounded in the proclamation of the Advent message,\nand now the message of the third angel began to sound. Under this\nmessage the significance of the Seventh-day Sabbath began to dawn.\nThe Beginnings of Sabbath Observance\nAs we trace the story of the beginning of Sabbathkeeping among\nthe early Adventists, we go to a little church in the township of\nWashington in the heart of New Hampshire, the state that adjoins\nMaine on the east and whose western boundary is within sixty miles\nof the New York state line. Here the members of an independent\nChristian church in 1843 heard and accepted the preaching of the\nAdvent message. It was an earnest group. Into their midst came\nPreface xix\na Seventh Day Baptist, Rachel Oakes, who distributed tracts set-\nting forth the binding claims of the fourth commandment. Some\nin 1844 saw and accepted this Bible truth. One of their number,\nWilliam Farnsworth, in a Sunday morning service, stood to his feet\nand declared that he intended to keep God\u2019s Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment. A dozen others joined him, taking their stand firmly\non all of God\u2019s commandments. They were the first Seventh-day\nAdventists.\nThe minister who cared for this church group, Frederick Wheeler,\nsoon accepted the seventh-day Sabbath and was the first Adventist\nminister to do so. Another of the Advent preachers, T. M. Pre-\nble, who lived in the same state, accepted the Sabbath truth and in\nFebruary, 1845, published an article in the Hope of Israel, one of\nthe Adventist journals, setting forth the binding claims of the fourth [xxi]\ncommandment. Joseph Bates, a prominent Adventist minister resid-\ning in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, read the Preble article and accepted\nthe Seventh-day Sabbath. Shortly thereafter, Elder Bates journeyed\nto Washington, New Hampshire, to study this new-found truth with\nthe Sabbathkeeping Adventists residing there. When he returned to\nhis home, he was fully convinced of the Sabbath truth. Bates in time\ndetermined to publish a tract setting forth the binding claims of the\nfourth commandment. His 48-page Sabbath pamphlet was published\nin August, 1846. A copy of it came to the hands of James and Ellen\nWhite at about the time of their marriage in late August. From the\nscriptural evidence therein presented, they accepted, and began to\nkeep the seventh-day Sabbath. Of this Ellen White later wrote: \u201cIn\nthe autumn of 1846 we began to observe the Bible Sabbath, and to\nteach and defend it.\u201d\u2014Testimonies for the Church 1:75.\nSignificance of the Sabbath Revealed\nJames and Ellen White took their stand purely from the scriptural\nevidence to which their minds had been directed in the Bates tract.\nThen on the first Sabbath in April, 1847, seven months after they\nbegan to keep and teach the Seventh-day Sabbath, the Lord gave a\nvision to Mrs. White at Topsham, Maine, in which the importance\nof the Sabbath was stressed. She saw the tables of the law in the\nark in the heavenly sanctuary, and a halo of light about the fourth\nxx Early Writings\ncommandment. See pages 32-35 for the account of this vision. The\nposition previously taken from the study of the word of God was\nconfirmed. The vision also helped to broaden the believer\u2019s concept\nof Sabbath observance. In this revelation, Mrs. White was carried\ndown to the close of time and saw the Sabbath as the great testing[xxii]\ntruth on which men decide whether to serve God or to serve an\napostate power. Looking back in 1874 to this experience, she wrote:\n\u201cI believed the truth upon the Sabbath question before I had\nseen anything in vision in reference to the Sabbath. It was months\nafter I had commenced keeping the Sabbath before I was shown\nits importance and its place in the third angel\u2019s message.\u201d\u2014E. G.\nWhite Letter 2, 1874.\nThe Important Sabbath Conferences\nIn the providence of God the several Sabbathkeeping ministers\nwho led out in teaching these new-found truths in company with a\nnumber of their followers, came together in 1848 in five Sabbath\nconferences. Through periods of fasting and prayer they studied the\nword of God. Elder Bates, the apostle of the Sabbath truth, took the\nlead in advocating the binding claims of the Sabbath. Hiram Edson\nand his associates, who attended some of the conferences, were\nstrong in their presentation of the sanctuary light. James White, a\ncareful student of prophecy, focused his attention on events that must\ntake place before Jesus comes again. At these meetings the lead-\ning doctrines held today by Seventh-day Adventists were brought\ntogether.\nLooking back to this experience, Ellen White wrote:\n\u201cMany of our people do not realize how firmly the foundation\nof our faith has been laid. My husband, Elder Joseph Bates, Father\nPierce, [Older brethren among the pioneers are here thus reminis-\ncently referred to. \u201cFather Pierce\u201d was Stephen Pierce, who served\nin ministerial and administrative work in the early days.] Elder [Hi-\nram] Edson, and others who were keen, noble, and true, were among\nthose who, after the passing of the time in 1844, searched for the\ntruth as for hidden treasure. I met with them, and we studied and\nprayed earnestly. Often we remained together until late at night, and[xxiii]\nsometimes through the entire night, praying for light and studying\nPreface xxi\nthe Word. Again and again these brethren came together to study the\nBible, in order that they might know its meaning, and be prepared\nto teach it with power. When they came to the point in their study\nwhere they said, \u201cwe can do nothing more,\u2019 the Spirit of the Lord\nwould come upon me, I would be taken off in vision, and a clear\nexplanation of the passages we had been studying would be given\nme, with instruction as to how we were to labor and teach effectively.\nThus light was given that helped us to understand the scriptures in\nregard to Christ, His mission, and His priesthood. A line of truth\nextending from that time to the time when we shall enter the city of\nGod, was made plain to me, and I gave to others the instruction that\nthe Lord had given me.\n\u201cDuring this whole time I could not understand the reasoning\nof the brethren. My mind was locked, as it were, and I could not\ncomprehend the meaning of the scriptures we were studying. This\nwas one of the greatest sorrows of my life. I was in this condition\nof mind until all the principal points of our faith were made clear to\nour minds, in harmony with the Word of God. The brethren knew\nthat when not in vision, I could not understand these matters, and\nthey accepted as light direct from heaven the revelations given.\u201d\u2014\nSelected Messages 1:206, 207.\nThus the doctrinal foundation of the Seventh-day Adventist\nChurch was laid in the faithful study of the Word of God, and when\nthe pioneers could not make headway, Ellen White was given light\nthat helped to explain their difficulty and opened the way for the\nstudy to continue. The visions also placed the stamp of God\u2019s ap-\nproval upon correct conclusions. Thus the prophetic gift acted as [xxiv]\na corrector of error and a confirmer of truth. (See Gospel Workers,\n302.)\nThe Pioneers Begin to Publish\nIt was shortly after the fifth of these Sabbath conferences held in\n1848 that another meeting was called at the home of Otis Nichols\nin Dorchester (near Boston), Massachusetts. The brethren were\nstudying and praying concerning their responsibility to herald the\nlight that the Lord had caused to shine upon their pathway. As they\nstudied, Ellen White was taken off in vision, and in this revelation\nxxii Early Writings\nshe was shown the duty of the brethren to publish this light. She\nrecounts the incident in Life Sketches.\n\u201cAfter coming out of vision, I said to my husband: \u2018I have a\nmessage for you. You must begin to print a little paper and send it\nout to the people. Let it be small at first; but as the people read, they\nwill send you means with which to print, and it will be a success\nfrom the first. From this small beginning it was shown to me to be\nlike streams of light that went clear round the world.\u2019\u201d\u2014Page 125.\nHere was a call to action. What could James White do? He had\nlittle of this world\u2019s goods. But the vision was a divine directive,\nand he felt the compulsion to move forward by faith. So with his\nseventy-five cent Bible and concordance with both covers torn off,\nJames White began to prepare the articles on the Sabbath truth and\nother kindred topics to be printed in a little paper. All this took time,\nbut eventually he presented the copy to a printer in Middletown,\nConnecticut, who was willing to trust him for the printing order.\nThe type was set, the proofs were read, and one thousand copies\nof the paper were printed. James White transported them from\nthe Middletown printing office to the Belden home where he and\nEllen had found a temporary refuge. The little sheet was six by[xxv]\nnine inches in size and contained eight pages. It bore the title The\nPresent Truth. The date was July, 1849. The little pile of papers\nwas laid upon the floor. Then the brethren and sisters gathered about\nthem and with tears in their eyes pleaded with God to bless the\nlittle sheet as it should be sent out. Then the papers were folded,\nwrapped and addressed, and James White carried them eight miles\nto the Middletown post office. Thus the publishing work of the\nSeventh-day Adventist Church began.\nFour issues were sent out in this manner, and each was prayed\nover before the papers were taken to the post office. Soon letters\nwere received telling of people who had begun to keep the Sabbath\nfrom reading the papers. Some of the letters contained money, and\nJames White, in September, was able to pay the Middletown printer\nthe $64.50 due for the four issues.\nPreface xxiii\nStarting the Review and Herald\nAs James and Ellen White traveled from place to place, staying\na few months here and a few months there, they arranged for the\npublishing of a few issues of the paper. Finally the eleventh and\nlast issue was published at Paris, Maine, in November, 1850. Mrs.\nWhite contributed several articles to The Present Truth. Most of\nthese are to be found in the first part of Early Writings, 36-54.\nAlso in November, a conference was held in Paris, and the\nbrethren gave study to the growing publishing work. They decided\nto enlarge the paper and they changed its name toThe Second Advent\nReview and Sabbath Herald. It was published for a few months at\nParis, Maine, then at Saratoga Springs, New York. It has been\npublished from that day to this as the church paper of the Seventh-\nday Adventists.\nThe Publishing Work Grows [xxvi]\nWhile living at Saratoga Springs, James White arranged in Au-\ngust, 1851, for the printing of Mrs. White\u2019s first book titled A Sketch\nof the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White, now pages\n11-83 of this work. With its 64 pages, it was only a pamphlet.\nIn the spring of 1852, the Whites moved to Rochester, New\nYork, and there established an office in which they could do their\nown printing. The brethren rallied to the appeal for money with\nwhich to purchase a printing press and six hundred dollars was\nraised to secure the equipment. How happy the early believers were\nwhen our papers could be issued on a Sabbathkeeping press! For a\nlittle more than three years, they lived in Rochester and published the\nmessage there. In addition to the Review and Herald and the Youth\u2019s\nInstructor begun by James White in 1852, they also, from time to\ntime, published tracts. Mrs. White\u2019s second pamphlet, Supplement\nto the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White , was\npublished in Rochester in January, 1854. This is now in Early\nWritings, 85-127.\nxxiv Early Writings\nBattle Creek Becomes the Publishing Center\nIn November, 1855, James and Ellen White and their helpers\nmoved to Battle Creek, Michigan. The press and other pieces of\nprinting equipment were placed in a building erected by several of\nthe Sabbathkeeping Adventists who had furnished the money with\nwhich to establish their own printing office. As their work developed\nin that little city, Battle Creek became the natural headquarters of\nthe Seventh-day Adventist Church. But it was with difficulty that\nJames White maintained the publishing work.\nAs we study the background of Early Writings, it should be[xxvii]\nnoted that the early Sabbathkeeping Adventists at first had a burden\nto reach with the Sabbath truth only their former brethren in the\ngreat Advent Awakening; that is, those who had been with them in\nthe first and the second angels\u2019 messages. Consequently for about\nseven years after 1844, their labors were very largely for Adventists\nwho had not yet taken their stand on the third angel\u2019s message. To\none familiar with the circumstances, this is understandable.\nThe \u201cShut Door\u201d and the \u201cOpen Door\u201d\nIn the special efforts which were made to proclaim the Advent\nmessage in the summer of 1844, the leaders in the movement had\nseen their own experience in the parable of the ten virgins recorded\nin Matthew 25. There had been a \u201ctarrying time\u201d followed by\nthe cry, \u201cBehold the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.\u201d\nThis was commonly referred to as \u201cthe midnight cry.\u201d In her first\nvision, this was shown to Mrs. White as a bright light set up behind\nthe Adventists at the beginning of the path. In the parable, they\nread that those who were ready went in with the bridegroom to\nthe marriage, \u201cand the door was shut.\u201d (See Matthew 25:10.) They\ntherefore concluded that on October 22, 1844, the door of mercy was\nclosed to those who failed to accept the message which had been so\nwidely proclaimed. Some years later Ellen White wrote of this:\n\u201cAfter the passing of the time when the Saviour was expected,\nthey [the Advent believers] still believed His coming to be near; they\nheld that they had reached an important crisis, and that the work of\nChrist as man\u2019s intercessor before God, had ceased. It appeared to\nPreface xxv\nthem to be taught in the Bible, that man\u2019s probation would close\na short time before the actual coming of the Lord in the clouds of\nheaven. This seemed evident from those scriptures which point to a [xxviii]\ntime when men will seek, knock, and cry at the door of mercy, and it\nwill not be opened. And it was a question with them whether the date\nto which they had looked for the coming of Christ might not rather\nmark the beginning of this period which was immediately to precede\nHis coming. Having given the warning of the judgment near, they\nfelt that their work for the world was done, and they lost their burden\nof soul for the salvation of sinners, while the bold and blasphemous\nscoffing of the ungodly seemed to them another evidence that the\nSpirit of God had been withdrawn from the rejecters of His mercy.\nAll this confirmed them in the belief that probation had ended, or, as\nthey then expressed it, \u2018the door of mercy was shut.\u2019\u201d\u2014The Great\nControversy, 429.\nThen Mrs. White continues to show how light began to dawn on\nthis question:\n\u201cBut clearer light came with the investigation of the sanctuary\nquestion. They now saw that they were correct in believing that\nthe end of the 2300 days in 1844 marked an important crisis. But\nwhile it was true that that door of hope and mercy by which men\nhad for eighteen hundred years found access to God, was closed,\nanother door was opened, and forgiveness of sins was offered to\nmen through the intercession of Christ in the most holy. One part\nof His ministration had closed, only to give place to another. There\nwas still an \u2018open door\u2019 to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ was\nministering in the sinner\u2019s behalf.\n\u201cNow was seen the application of those words of Christ in the\nrevelation, addressed to the Church at this very time: \u2018These things\nsaith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David,\nHe that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man\nopeneth; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open [xxix]\ndoor, and no man can shut it.\u2019 (Revelation 3:7, 8.)\n\u201cIt is those who by faith follow Jesus in the great work of the\natonement, who receive the benefits of His mediation in their behalf;\nwhile those who reject the light which brings to view this work of\nministration, are not benefited thereby.\u201d\u2014The Great Controversy,\n429, 430.\nxxvi Early Writings\nThe Two Ways Out of the Perplexity\nMrs. White then speaks of how the two groups of Advent be-\nlievers related themselves to the experience of the disappointment\nof October 22, 1844:\n\u201cThe passing of the time in 1844 was followed by a period of\ngreat trial to those who still held the Advent faith. Their only relief,\nso far as ascertaining their true position was concerned, was the light\nwhich directed their minds to the sanctuary above. Some renounced\ntheir faith in their former reckoning of the prophetic periods, and\nascribed to human or satanic agencies the powerful influence of the\nHoly Spirit which had attended the Advent movement. Another class\nfirmly held that the Lord had led them in their past experience; and\nas they waited and watched and prayed to know the will of God, they\nsaw that their great High Priest had entered upon another work of\nministration, and following Him by faith, they were led to see also\nthe closing work of the church. They had a clearer understanding of\nthe first and second angels\u2019 messages, and were prepared to receive\nand give to the world the solemn warning of the third angel of\nRevelation 14.\u201d\u2014The Great Controversy, 431, 432.\nCertain references occur in this work, on pages 42-45, to the\n\u201copen door\u201d and the \u201cshut door.\u201d This is correctly understood only in\nthe light of the background of the experience of our early believers.\nNot too long after the Disappointment the pioneers saw that[xxx]\nwhile there were those who through the definite rejection of light\nhad closed the door to their salvation, there were many who had not\nheard the message and had not rejected it, and these might benefit\nfrom the provisions made for man\u2019s salvation. By the early 1850\u2019s\nthese points stood out clearly. Then too, avenues for the presentation\nof the three angel\u2019s messages were beginning to open up. Prejudice\nwas dying away. Ellen White, looking back to their experience\nfollowing the Disappointment wrote:\n\u201c\u2018It was then next to impossible to obtain access to unbeliev-\ners. The disappointment in 1844 had confused the minds of many,\nand they would not listen to any explanation of the matter.\u2019\u201d\u2014The\nReview and Herald, November 20, 1883.\nBut in 1851 Elder White was able to report: \u201c\u2018Now the door\nis open almost everywhere to present the truth, and many are pre-\nPreface xxvii\npared to read the publications who have formerly had no interest to\ninvestigate.\u2019\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, August 19, 1851.\nThe Call for Church Organization\nBut with these new opportunities, and with a larger number of\npeople accepting the message, a few discordant elements came into\ntheir midst. If these had not been checked, the work would have\nbeen greatly injured. But here again we see the providence of God\nin guiding his people, for on December 24, 1850, in a vision given\nto Ellen White, she tells us:\n\u201c\u2018I saw how great and holy God was. Said the angel, \u201cWalk\ncarefully before Him, for He is high and lifted up, and the train of\nHis glory fills the temple.\u201d I saw that everything in heaven was in\nperfect order. Said the angel, \u201cLook ye, Christ is the head, move\nin order, move in order. Have a meaning to everything.\u201d Said the [xxxi]\nangel, \u201cBehold ye and know how perfect, how beautiful, the order\nin heaven; follow it.\u201d\u2019\u201d\u2014Ellen G. White Manuscript 11, 1850.\nIt took time to lead the believers generally to appreciate the\nneeds and value of gospel order. Their past experiences in the\nProtestant churches from which they had separated led them to\nbe cautious. Except in those places where the practical need was\nvery evident, fear of inviting formality held the believers back from\nchurch organization. It was not until a decade after the vision of\n1850 that more mature plans for organization were finally effected.\nUndoubtedly a factor of primary importance in bringing the efforts\nto fruition was a comprehensive chapter entitled \u201cGospel Order,\u201d\nPublished in the Supplement to the Christian Experience and Views\nof Ellen G. White. This appears in this work as pages 97-104.\nIn 1860, in connection with the organizing of the publishing\nwork, a name was chosen. Some thought that \u201cChurch of God\u201d\nwould be appropriate, but the sentiment prevailed that the name\nshould reflect the distinctive teachings of the church. They adopted\n\u201cSeventh-day Adventist\u201d as their name. The following year some\ncompanies of believers organized themselves into churches, and\nthe churches in Michigan formed a State conference. Soon there\nwere several State conferences. Then in May, 1863, the General\nxxviii Early Writings\nConference of Seventh-day Adventists was organized. This takes us\nfive years beyond the time of Early Writings.\nThe Great Controversy Vision\nReference has been made to the moving of the publishing work\nfrom Rochester, New York, to Battle Creek, Michigan, in November,\n1855. Elder and Mrs. White made their home in Battle Creek, and\nafter the work was well established there, they were able to continue[xxxii]\ntheir travels in the field. It was in connection with a visit to the\nState of Ohio in February and March, 1858, that the important great\ncontroversy vision was given to Mrs. White in the public school-\nhouse at Lovett\u2019s Grove. The account of this vision which lasted\ntwo hours is found in Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, 161, 162. In\nSeptember, 1858, Spiritual Gifts, V olume I:The Great Controversy\nBetween Christ and His Angels and Satan and His Angels , was\npublished. This little book of 219 pages constitutes the third and last\ndivision of Early Writings.\nThe small publications of the first fifteen years of Mrs. White\u2019s\nwork were to be followed by many larger books dealing with many\nsubjects vital to those who keep the commandments of God and\nhave the faith of Jesus Christ. Nevertheless the earliest writings will\nalways be especially dear to the hearts of all Seventh-day Adventists.\nTrustees of the.\nEllen G. White Estate.\nWashington, D.C.\nMarch, 1963.\nExperience and Views [7]\nBy the request of dear friends I have consented to give a brief\nsketch of my experience and views, with the hope that it will cheer\nand strengthen the humble, trusting children of the Lord.\nAt the age of eleven years I was converted, and when twelve\nyears old was baptized, and joined the Methodist Church. [Mrs.\nWhite was born at Gorham, Maine, November 26, 1827.] At the\nage of thirteen I heard William Miller deliver his second course\nof lectures in Portland, Maine. I then felt that I was not holy, not\nready to see Jesus. And when the invitation was given for church\nmembers and sinners to come forward for prayers, I embraced the\nfirst opportunity, for I knew that I must have a great work done for\nme to fit me for heaven. My soul was thirsting for full and free\nsalvation, but knew not how to obtain it.\nIn 1842, I constantly attended the second advent meetings in\nPortland, Maine, and fully believed that the Lord was coming. I was\nhungering and thirsting for full salvation, an entire conformity to the\nwill of God. Day and night I was struggling to obtain this priceless\ntreasure, that all the riches of earth could not purchase. As I was\nbowed before God praying for this blessing, the duty to go and pray\nin a public prayer meeting was presented before me. I had never\nprayed vocally in meeting, and drew back from the duty, fearing\nthat if I should attempt to pray I would be confounded. Every time I\nwent before the Lord in secret prayer this unfulfilled duty presented\nitself, until I ceased to pray, and settled down in a melancholy state,\nand finally in deep despair. [12]\nIn this state of mind I remained for three weeks, with not one\nray of light to pierce the thick clouds of darkness around me. I then\n30 Early Writings\nhad two dreams which gave me a faint ray of light and hope. [The\ndreams here referred to will be found on pages 78-81.] After that\nI opened my mind to my devoted mother. She told me that I was\nnot lost and advised me to go and see Brother Stockman, who then\npreached to the Advent people in Portland. I had great confidence in\nhim, for he was a devoted and beloved servant of Christ. His words\naffected me and led me to hope. I returned home and again went\nbefore the Lord, and promised that I would do and suffer anything\nif I could have the smiles of Jesus. The same duty was presented.\nThere was to be a prayer meeting that evening, which I attended,\nand when others knelt to pray, I bowed with them trembling, and\nafter two or three had prayed, I opened my mouth in prayer before I\nwas aware of it, and the promises of God looked to me like so many\nprecious pearls that were to be received by only asking for them. As\nI prayed, the burden and agony of soul that I had so long felt left me,\nand the blessing of God came upon me like the gentle dew. I gave\nglory to God for what I felt, but I longed for more. I could not be\nsatisfied till I was filled with the fullness of God. Inexpressible love\nfor Jesus filled my soul. Wave after wave of glory rolled over me,\nuntil my body grew stiff. Everything was shut out from me but Jesus\nand glory, and I knew nothing of what was passing around me.\nI remained in this state of body and mind a long time, and when\nI realized what was around me, everything seemed changed. Ev-\nerything looked glorious and new, as if smiling and praising God. I\nwas then willing to confess Jesus everywhere. For six months not a[13]\ncloud of darkness passed over my mind. My soul was daily drinking\nrich draughts of salvation. I thought that those who loved Jesus\nwould love His coming, so went to the class meeting and told them\nwhat Jesus had done for me and what a fullness I enjoyed through\nbelieving that the Lord was coming. The class leader interrupted\nme, saying, \u201cThrough Methodism\u201d; but I could not give the glory\nto Methodism when it was Christ and the hope of His soon coming\nthat had made me free.\nMost of my father\u2019s family were full believers in the advent, and\nfor bearing testimony to this glorious doctrine seven of us were at\none time cast out of the Methodist Church. At this time the words\nof the prophet were exceedingly precious to us: \u201cYour brethren\nthat hated you, that cast you out for My name\u2019s sake, said, Let the\nExperience and Views 31\nLord be glorified: but He shall appear to your joy, and they shall be\nashamed.\u201d Isaiah 66:5.\nFrom this time, up to December, 1844, my joys, trials, and\ndisappointments were like those of my dear Advent friends around\nme. At this time I visited one of our Advent sisters, and in the\nmorning we bowed around the family altar. It was not an exciting\noccasion, and there were but five of us present, all women. While I\nwas praying, the power of God came upon me as I had never felt it\nbefore. I was wrapped in a vision of God\u2019s glory, and seemed to be\nrising higher and higher from the earth, and was shown something of\nthe travels of the Advent people to the Holy City, as narrated below.\nMy First Vision\n[This view was given soon after the great Advent Disappointment in\n1844, and was first published in 1846. Only a few of the events of\nthe future were seen at that time. Later views have been more full.\nSee also appendix.]\nAs God has shown me the travels of the Advent people to the[14]\nHoly City and the rich reward to be given those who wait the return\nof their Lord from the wedding, it may be my duty to give you a\nshort sketch of what God has revealed to me. The dear saints have\nmany trials to pass through. But our light afflictions, which are but\nfor a moment, will work for us a far more exceeding and eternal\nweight of glory\u2014while we look not at the things which are seen, for\nthe things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not\nseen are eternal. I have tried to bring back a good report and a few\ngrapes from the heavenly Canaan, for which many would stone me,\nas the congregation bade stone Caleb and Joshua for their report.\n(Numbers 14:10.) But I declare to you, my brethren and sisters in the\nLord, it is a goodly land, and we are well able to go up and possess\nit.\nWhile I was praying at the family altar, the Holy Ghost fell upon\nme, and I seemed to be rising higher and higher, far above the dark\nworld. I turned to look for the Advent people in the world, but could\nnot find them, when a voice said to me, \u201cLook again, and look a\nlittle higher.\u201d At this I raised my eyes, and saw a straight and narrow\npath, cast up high above the world. On this path the Advent people\nwere traveling to the city, which was at the farther end of the path.\nThey had a bright light set up behind them at the beginning of the\npath, which an angel told me was the midnight cry. This light shone\nall along the path and gave light for their feet so that they might not\nstumble. If they kept their eyes fixed on Jesus, who was just before\nthem, leading them to the city, they were safe. But soon some grew\nweary, and said the city was a great way off, and they expected to\n32\nMy First Vision 33\nhave entered it before. Then Jesus would encourage them by raising [15]\nHis glorious right arm, and from His arm came a light which waved\nover the Advent band, and they shouted, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d Others rashly\ndenied the light behind them and said that it was not God that had\nled them out so far. The light behind them went out, leaving their\nfeet in perfect darkness, and they stumbled and lost sight of the mark\nand of Jesus, and fell off the path down into the dark and wicked\nworld below. Soon we [see Appendix.] heard the voice of God like\nmany waters, which gave us the day and hour of Jesus\u2019 coming. The\nliving saints, 144,000 in number, knew and understood the voice,\nwhile the wicked thought it was thunder and an earthquake. When\nGod spoke the time, He poured upon us the Holy Ghost, and our\nfaces began to light up and shine with the glory of God, as Moses\u2019\ndid when he came down from Mount Sinai.\nThe 144,000 were all sealed and perfectly united. On their\nforeheads was written, God, New Jerusalem, and a glorious star\ncontaining Jesus\u2019 new name. At our happy, holy state the wicked\nwere enraged, and would rush violently up to lay hands on us to\nthrust us into prison, when we would stretch forth the hand in the\nname of the Lord, and they would fall helpless to the ground. Then\nit was that the synagogue of Satan knew that God had loved us who\ncould wash one another\u2019s feet and salute the brethren with a holy\nkiss, and they worshiped at our feet.\nSoon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a small black cloud\nhad appeared, about half as large as a man\u2019s hand, which we all\nknew was the sign of the Son of man. We all in solemn silence\ngazed on the cloud as it drew nearer and became lighter, glorious,\nand still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom\nappeared like fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it\nwere ten thousand angels, singing a most lovely song; and upon it [16]\nsat the Son of man. His hair was white and curly and lay on His\nshoulders; and upon His head were many crowns. His feet had the\nappearance of fire; in His right hand was a sharp sickle; in His left,\na silver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame of fire, which searched\nHis children through and through. Then all faces gathered paleness,\nand those that God had rejected gathered blackness. Then we all\ncried out, \u201cWho shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless?\u201d Then\nthe angels ceased to sing, and there was some time of awful silence,\n34 Early Writings\nwhen Jesus spoke: \u201cThose who have clean hands and pure hearts\nshall be able to stand; My grace is sufficient for you.\u201d At this our\nfaces lighted up, and joy filled every heart. And the angels struck\na note higher and sang again, while the cloud drew still nearer the\nearth.\nThen Jesus\u2019 silver trumpet sounded, as He descended on the\ncloud, wrapped in flames of fire. He gazed on the graves of the\nsleeping saints, then raised His eyes and hands to heaven, and cried,\n\u201cAwake! awake! awake! ye that sleep in the dust, and arise.\u201d Then\nthere was a mighty earthquake. The graves opened, and the dead\ncame up clothed with immortality. The 144,000 shouted, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d\nas they recognized their friends who had been torn from them by\ndeath, and in the same moment we were changed and caught up\ntogether with them to meet the Lord in the air.\nWe all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascending\nto the sea of glass, when Jesus brought the crowns, and with His\nown right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold\nand palms of victory. Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in\na perfect square. Some of them had very bright crowns, others not\nso bright. Some crowns appeared heavy with stars, while others had\nbut few. All were perfectly satisfied with their crowns. And they\nwere all clothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders[17]\nto their feet. Angels were all about us as we marched over the sea of\nglass to the gate of the city. Jesus raised His mighty, glorious arm,\nlaid hold of the pearly gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges,\nand said to us, \u201cYou have washed your robes in My blood, stood\nstiffly for My truth, enter in.\u201d We all marched in and felt that we had\na perfect right in the city.\nHere we saw the tree of life and the throne of God. Out of the\nthrone came a pure river of water, and on either side of the river\nwas the tree of life. On one side of the river was a trunk of a tree,\nand a trunk on the other side of the river, both of pure, transparent\ngold. At first I thought I saw two trees. I looked again, and saw that\nthey were united at the top in one tree. So it was the tree of life on\neither side of the river of life. Its branches bowed to the place where\nwe stood, and the fruit was glorious; it looked like gold mixed with\nsilver.\nMy First Vision 35\nWe all went under the tree and sat down to look at the glory\nof the place, when Brethren Fitch and Stockman, [see Appendix.]\nwho had preached the gospel of the kingdom, and whom God had\nlaid in the grave to save them, came up to us and asked us what\nwe had passed through while they were sleeping. We tried to call\nup our greatest trials, but they looked so small compared with the\nfar more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that surrounded us\nthat we could not speak them out, and we all cried out, \u201cAlleluia,\nheaven is cheap enough!\u201d and we touched our glorious harps and\nmade heaven\u2019s arches ring.\nWith Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to\nthis earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear\nJesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then\nwe looked up and saw the great city, with twelve foundations, and [18]\ntwelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We all\ncried out, \u201cThe city, the great city, it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming down\nfrom God out of heaven,\u201d and it came and settled on the place where\nwe stood. Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of\nthe city. There I saw most glorious houses, that had the appearance\nof silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls most glorious to\nbehold. These were to be inhabited by the saints. In each was a\ngolden shelf. I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off\ntheir glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the\nfield by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have\nto do with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light shone all about\ntheir heads, and they were continually shouting and offering praises\nto God.\nI saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I plucked\nthem, I cried out, \u201cThey will never fade.\u201d Next I saw a field of\ntall grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green and had a\nreflection of silver and gold, as it waved proudly to the glory of King\nJesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts\u2014the lion,\nthe lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect union. We\npassed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably\nafter. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have\nhere; no, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the\ntrees moved to and fro, and we all cried out, \u201cWe will dwell safely\n36 Early Writings\nin the wilderness and sleep in the woods.\u201d We passed through the\nwoods, for we were on our way to Mount Zion.\nAs we were traveling along, we met a company who also were\ngazing at the glories of the place. I noticed red as a border on their\ngarments; their crowns were brilliant; their robes were pure white.\nAs we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were. He said they were[19]\nmartyrs that had been slain for Him. With them was an innumerable\ncompany of little ones; they also had a hem of red on their garments.\nMount Zion was just before us, and on the mount was a glorious\ntemple, and about it were seven other mountains, on which grew\nroses and lilies. And I saw the little ones climb, or, if they chose, use\ntheir little wings and fly, to the top of the mountains and pluck the\nnever-fading flowers. There were all kinds of trees around the temple\nto beautify the place: the box, the pine, the fir, the oil, the myrtle,\nthe pomegranate, and the fig tree bowed down with the weight of its\ntimely figs\u2014these made the place all over glorious. And as we were\nabout to enter the holy temple, Jesus raised His lovely voice and said,\n\u201cOnly the 144,000 enter this place,\u201d and we shouted, \u201cAlleluia.\u201d\nThis temple was supported by seven pillars, all of transparent\ngold, set with pearls most glorious. The wonderful things I there saw\nI cannot describe. Oh, that I could talk in the language of Canaan,\nthen could I tell a little of the glory of the better world. I saw there\ntables of stone in which the names of the 144,000 were engraved\nin letters of gold. After we beheld the glory of the temple, we went\nout, and Jesus left us and went to the city. Soon we heard His lovely\nvoice again, saying, \u201cCome, My people, you have come out of great\ntribulation, and done My will; suffered for Me; come in to supper,\nfor I will gird Myself, and serve you.\u201d We shouted, \u201cAlleluia! glory!\u201d\nand entered into the city. And I saw a table of pure silver; it was\nmany miles in length, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the\nfruit of the tree of life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates,\ngrapes, and many other kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of\nthe fruit. He said, \u201cNot now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land[20]\ngo back to earth no more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall\nboth eat of the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of the\nfountain.\u201d And He said, \u201cYou must go back to the earth again and\nrelate to others what I have revealed to you.\u201d Then an angel bore me\ngently down to this dark world. Sometimes I think I can stay here\nMy First Vision 37\nno longer; all things of earth look so dreary. I feel very lonely here,\nfor I have seen a better land. Oh, that I had wings like a dove, then\nwould I fly away and be at rest!\n* * * * *\nAfter I came out of vision, everything looked changed; a gloom\nwas spread over all that I beheld. Oh, how dark this world looked\nto me. I wept when I found myself here, and felt homesick. I had\nseen a better world, and it had spoiled this for me. I told the view to\nour little band in Portland, who then fully believed it to be of God.\nThat was a powerful time. The solemnity of eternity rested upon\nus. About one week after this the Lord gave me another view and\nshowed me the trials I must pass through, and that I must go and\nrelate to others what He had revealed to me, and that I should meet\nwith great opposition and suffer anguish of spirit by going. But said\nthe angel, \u201cThe grace of God is sufficient for you; He will hold you\nup.\u201d\nAfter I came out of this vision, I was exceedingly troubled. My\nhealth was very poor, and I was but seventeen years old. I knew that\nmany had fallen through exaltation, and I knew that if I in any way\nbecame exalted, God would leave me, and I should surely be lost.\nI went to the Lord in prayer and begged Him to lay the burden on\nsomeone else. It seemed to me that I could not bear it. I lay upon\nmy face a long time, and all the light I could get was, \u201cMake known\nto others what I have revealed to you.\u201d\nIn my next vision I earnestly begged of the Lord that, if I must [21]\ngo and relate what He had shown to me, He would keep me from\nexaltation. Then He showed me that my prayer was answered, and\nif I should be in danger of exaltation His hand would be laid upon\nme, and I would be afflicted with sickness. Said the angel, \u201cIf you\ndeliver the messages faithfully, and endure unto the end, you shall\neat of the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of the river\nof life.\u201d\nSoon it was reported all around that the visions were the result\nof mesmerism, [see Appendix.] and many Adventists were ready to\nbelieve and circulate the report. A physician who was a celebrated\nmesmerizer told me that my views were mesmerism, that I was a\n38 Early Writings\nvery easy subject, and that he could mesmerize me and give me\na vision. I told him that the Lord had shown me in vision that\nmesmerism was from the devil, from the bottomless pit, and that it\nwould soon go there, with those who continued to use it. I then gave\nhim liberty to mesmerize me if he could. He tried for more than half\nan hour, resorting to different operations, and then gave it up. By\nfaith in God I was able to resist his influence, so that it did not affect\nme in the least.\nIf I had a vision in meeting, many would say that it was excite-\nment and that someone mesmerized me. Then I would go away\nalone in the woods, where no eye or ear but God\u2019s could see or\nhear, and pray to Him, and He would sometimes give me a vision\nthere. I then rejoiced, and told them what God had revealed to me\nalone, where no mortal could influence me. But I was told by some\nthat I mesmerized myself. Oh, thought I, has it come to this that\nthose who honestly go to God alone to plead His promises and to\nclaim His salvation, are to be charged with being under the foul and\nsoul-damning influence of mesmerism? Do we ask our kind Father\nin heaven for \u201cbread,\u201d only to receive a \u201cstone\u201d or a \u201cscorpion\u201d?[22]\nThese things wounded my spirit, and wrung my soul in keen anguish,\nwell-nigh to despair, while many would have me believe that there\nwas no Holy Ghost and that all the exercises that holy men of God\nhave experienced were only mesmerism or the deceptions of Satan.\nAt this time there was fanaticism in Maine. Some refrained\nwholly from labor and disfellowshiped all those who would not\nreceive their views on this point, and some other things which they\nheld to be religious duties. God revealed these errors to me in vision\nand sent me to His erring children to declare them; but many of them\nwholly rejected the message, and charged me with conforming to the\nworld. On the other hand, the nominal Adventists charged me with\nfanaticism, and I was falsely, and by some wickedly, represented\nas being the leader of the fanaticism that I was actually laboring to\ncorrect. Different times were repeatedly set for the Lord to come\nand were urged upon the brethren; but the Lord showed me that\nthey would all pass by, for the time of trouble must come before the\ncoming of Christ, and that every time that was set and passed by\nwould only weaken the faith of God\u2019s people. For this I was charged\nMy First Vision 39\nwith being with the evil servant that said in his heart, \u201cMy Lord\ndelayeth His coming.\u201d\nAll these things weighed heavily upon my spirits, and in the\nconfusion I was sometimes tempted to doubt my own experience.\nWhile at family prayers one morning, the power of God began to\nrest upon me, and the thought rushed into my mind that it was\nmesmerism, and I resisted it. Immediately I was struck dumb and\nfor a few moments was lost to everything around me. I then saw my\nsin in doubting the power of God, and that for so doing I was struck\ndumb, and that my tongue would be loosed in less than twenty-four\nhours. A card was held up before me, on which were written in [23]\nletters of gold the chapter and verse of fifty texts of Scripture. [These\ntexts are given at the close of this article.] After I came out of vision,\nI beckoned for the slate, and wrote upon it that I was dumb, also\nwhat I had seen, and that I wished the large Bible. I took the Bible\nand readily turned to all the texts that I had seen upon the card. I\nwas unable to speak all day. Early the next morning my soul was\nfilled with joy, and my tongue was loosed to shout the high praises\nof God. After that I dared not doubt or for a moment resist the power\nof God, however others might think of me.\nIn 1846, while at Fairhaven, Massachusetts, my sister (who\nusually accompanied me at that time), Sister A., Brother G., and\nmyself started in a sailboat to visit a family on West\u2019s Island. It was\nalmost night when we started. We had gone but a short distance\nwhen a storm suddenly arose. It thundered and lightened, and the\nrain came in torrents upon us. It seemed plain that we must be lost,\nunless God should deliver.\nI knelt down in the boat and began to cry to God to deliver us.\nAnd there upon the tossing billows, while the water washed over the\ntop of the boat upon us, I was taken off in vision and saw that sooner\nwould every drop of water in the ocean be dried up than we perish,\nfor my work had but just begun. After I came out of the vision all\nmy fears were gone, and we sang and praised God, and our little\nboat was to us a floating Bethel. The editor of The Advent Herald\nhas said that my visions were known to be \u201cthe result of mesmeric\noperations.\u201d But, I ask, what opportunity was there for mesmeric\noperations in such a time as that? Brother G. had more than he\ncould well do to manage the boat. He tried to anchor, but the anchor\n40 Early Writings\ndragged. Our little boat was tossed upon the waves and driven by the\nwind, while it was so dark that we could not see from one end of the[24]\nboat to the other. Soon the anchor held, and Brother G. called for\nhelp. There were but two houses on the island, and it proved that we\nwere near one of them, but not the one where we wished to go. All\nthe family had retired to rest except a little child, who providentially\nheard the call for help upon the water. Her father soon came to our\nrelief, and, in a small boat, took us to the shore. We spent the most\nof that night in thanksgiving and praise to God for His wonderful\ngoodness unto us.\n* * * * *\nTexts Referred to on Preceding Page\nAnd, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the\nday that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not\nMy words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. Luke 1:20.\nAll things that the Father hath are Mine: therefore said I, that He\nshall take of Mine, and shall show it unto you. John 16:15.\nAnd they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak\nwith other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. Acts 2:4.\nAnd now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto Thy\nservants, that with all boldness they may speak Thy word, by stretch-\ning forth Thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be\ndone by the name of Thy holy child Jesus. And when they had\nprayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together;\nand they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the\nword of God with boldness. Acts 4:29-31.\nGive not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your\npearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and\nturn again and rend you. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and\nye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for everyone\nthat asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that[25]\nknocketh it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if\nhis son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will\nhe give him a serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good\ngifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which\nMy First Vision 41\nis in heaven give good things to them that ask Him? Therefore all\nthings whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even\nso to them: for this is the law and the prophets. Beware of false\nprophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they\nare ravening wolves. Matthew 7:6-12, 15.\nFor there shall arise false christs, and false prophets, and shall\nshow great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible,\nthey shall deceive the very elect. Matthew 24:24.\nAs ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye\nin Him: rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as\nye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. Beware\nlest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after\nthe tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after\nChrist. Colossians 2:6-8.\nCast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great rec-\nompense of reward. For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have\ndone the will of God, ye might receive the promise. For yet a little\nwhile, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. Now\nthe just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, My soul shall\nhave no pleasure in him. But we are not of them who draw back\nunto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.\nHebrews 10:35-39.\nFor he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his\nown works, as God did from His. Let us labor therefore to enter\ninto that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.\nFor the Word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any\ntwo-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and\nspirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts\nand intents of the heart. Hebrews 4:10-12.\nBeing confident of this very thing, that He which hath begun [26]\na good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ....\nOnly let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ:\nthat whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of\nyour affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving\ntogether for the faith of the gospel; and in nothing terrified by your\nadversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to\nyou of salvation, and that of God. For unto you it is given in the\n42 Early Writings\nbehalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for\nHis sake. Philippians 1:6, 27-29.\nFor it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His\ngood pleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings:\nthat ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without\nrebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom\nye shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:13-15.\nFinally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power\nof His might. Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able\nto stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against\nflesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against\nthe rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness\nin high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God,\nthat ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done\nall, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth,\nand having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod\nwith the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the\nshield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery\ndarts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword\nof the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Praying always with all\nprayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with\nall perseverance and supplication for all saints. Ephesians 6:10-18.\nAnd be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one\nanother, even as God for Christ\u2019s sake hath forgiven you. Ephesians\n4:32.\nSeeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through[27]\nthe Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one\nanother with a pure heart fervently. 1 Peter 1:22.\nA new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;\nas I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all\nmen know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another.\nJohn 13:34, 35.\nExamine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own\nselves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in\nyou, except ye be reprobates? 2 Corinthians 13:5.\nAccording to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a\nwise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth\nthereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.\nMy First Vision 43\nFor other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus\nChrist. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver,\nprecious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man\u2019s work shall be made\nmanifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed\nby fire; and the fire shall try every man\u2019s work of what sort it is. 1\nCorinthians 3:10-13.\nTake heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the\nwhich the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church\nof God, which He hath purchased with His own blood. For I know\nthis, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among\nyou, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise,\nspeaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. Acts\n20:28-30.\nI marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him that called you\ninto the grace of Christ unto another gospel: which is not another;\nbut there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of\nChrist. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other\ngospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him\nbe accursed. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man\npreach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him\nbe accursed. Galatians 1:6-9.\nTherefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard [28]\nin the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall\nbe proclaimed upon the housetops. And I say unto you My friends,\nBe not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more\nthat they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear\nHim, which after He hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I\nsay unto you, Fear Him. Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings,\nand not one of them is forgotten before God? But even the very hairs\nof your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more\nvalue than many sparrows. Luke 12:3-7.\nFor it is written, He shall give His angels charge over thee, to\nkeep thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time\nthou dash thy foot against a stone. Luke 4:10, 11.\nFor God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,\nhath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the\nglory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure\nin earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God,\n44 Early Writings\nand not of us. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we\nare perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast\ndown, but not destroyed. 2 Corinthians 4:6-9.\nFor our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for\nus a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look\nnot at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen:\nfor the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are\nnot seen are eternal. 2 Corinthians 4:17, 18.\nWho are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation\nready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein ye greatly rejoice,\nthough now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through\nmanifold temptations: that the trial of your faith, being much more\nprecious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire,\nmight be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of\nJesus Christ. 1 Peter 1:5-7.\nFor now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 1 Thessalonians\n3:8.\nAnd these things shall follow them that believe: In My name[29]\nshall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they\nshall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not\nhurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\nMark 16:17, 18.\nHis parents answered them and said, We know that this is our\nson, and that he was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we\nknow not; or who hath opened his eyes we know not: he is of age;\nask him: he shall speak for himself. These words spake his parents,\nbecause they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if\nany man did confess that He was Christ, he should be put out of the\nsynagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. Then\nagain called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give\nGod the praise: we know that this Man is a sinner. He answered and\nsaid, Whether He be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know,\nthat, whereas I was blind, now I see. Then said they to him again,\nWhat did He to thee? how opened He thine eyes? He answered\nthem, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would\nye hear it again? Would ye also be His disciples? John 9:20-27.\nAnd whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the\nFather may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask anything in My\nMy First Vision 45\nname, I will do it. If ye love Me, keep My commandments. John\n14:13-15.\nIf ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what\nye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is My Father glorified,\nthat ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples. John 15:7, 8.\nAnd there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;\nand he cried out, saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with Thee,\nThou Jesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee\nwho Thou art, the Holy One of God. And Jesus rebuked him, saying,\nHold thy peace, and come out of him. Mark 1:23-25.\nFor I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor [30]\nprincipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,\nnor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans\n8:38, 39.\nAnd to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These\nthings saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of\nDavid, He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no\nman openeth; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an\nopen door, and no man can shut it; for thou hast a little strength, and\nhast kept My word, and hast not denied My name. Behold, I will\nmake them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and\nare not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship\nbefore thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Because thou\nhast kept the word of My patience, I also will keep thee from the\nhour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them\nthat dwell upon the earth. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast\nwhich thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that overcometh\nwill I make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall go no\nmore out: and I will write upon him the name of My God, and the\nname of the city of My God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh\ndown out of heaven from My God: and I will write upon him My\nnew name. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith\nunto the churches. Revelation 3:7-13.\nThese are they which were not defiled with women; for they are\nvirgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He\ngoeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits\nunto God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile:\n46 Early Writings\nfor they are without fault before the throne of God. Revelation 14:4,\n5.\nFor our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for\nthe Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. Philippians 3:20.\nBe patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.\nBehold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth,\nand hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.[31]\nBe ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord\ndraweth nigh. James 5:7, 8.\nWho shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like\nunto His glorious body, according to the working whereby He is\nable even to subdue all things unto Himself. Philippians 3:21.\nAnd I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one\nsat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown,\nand in His hand a sharp sickle. And another angel came out of the\ntemple, crying with a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Thrust\nin Thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for Thee to reap; for\nthe harvest of the earth is ripe. And He that sat on the cloud thrust in\nHis sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. And another angel\ncame out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp\nsickle. Revelation 14:14-17.\nThere remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. Hebrews\n4:9.\nAnd I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from\nGod out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.\nRevelation 21:2.\nAnd I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the Mount Sion, and with\nHim an hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father\u2019s name\nwritten in their foreheads. Revelation 14:1.\nAnd he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal,\nproceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst\nof the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of\nlife, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every\nmonth: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.\nAnd there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the\nLamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him. And they shall\nsee His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads. And there\nshall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the\nMy First Vision 47\nsun; for the Lord giveth them light: and they shall reign forever and\never. Revelation 22:1-5.\nSubsequent Visions[32]\nThe Lord gave me the following view in 1847, while the brethren\nwere assembled on the Sabbath, at Topsham, Maine.\nWe felt an unusual spirit of prayer. And as we prayed the Holy\nGhost fell upon us. We were very happy. Soon I was lost to earthly\nthings and was wrapped in a vision of God\u2019s glory. I saw an angel\nflying swiftly to me. He quickly carried me from the earth to the\nHoly City. In the city I saw a temple, which I entered. I passed\nthrough a door before I came to the first veil. This veil was raised,\nand I passed into the holy place. Here I saw the altar of incense,\nthe candlestick with seven lamps, and the table on which was the\nshewbread. After viewing the glory of the holy, Jesus raised the\nsecond veil and I passed into the holy of holies.\nIn the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest\ngold. On each end of the ark was a lovely cherub, with its wings\nspread out over it. Their faces were turned toward each other, and\nthey looked downward. Between the angels was a golden censer.\nAbove the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright\nglory, that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. Jesus stood\nby the ark, and as the saints\u2019 prayers came up to Him, the incense\nin the censer would smoke, and He would offer up their prayers\nwith the smoke of the incense to His Father. In the ark was the\ngolden pot of manna, Aaron\u2019s rod that budded, and the tables of\nstone which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I\nsaw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God.\nOn one table were four, and on the other six. The four on the first\ntable shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the Sabbath[33]\ncommandment, shone above them all; for the Sabbath was set apart\nto be kept in honor of God\u2019s holy name. The holy Sabbath looked\nglorious\u2014a halo of glory was all around it. I saw that the Sabbath\ncommandment was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine\ncommandments were; and we are at liberty to break them all, as well\nas to break the fourth. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath,\n48\nSubsequent Visions 49\nfor He never changes. But the pope had changed it from the seventh\nto the first day of the week; for he was to change times and laws.\nAnd I saw that if God had changed the Sabbath from the seventh\nto the first day, He would have changed the writing of the Sabbath\ncommandment, written on the tables of stone, which are now in the\nark in the most holy place of the temple in heaven; and it would read\nthus: The first day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. But I saw\nthat it read the same as when written on the tables of stone by the\nfinger of God, and delivered to Moses on Sinai. \u201cBut the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.\u201d I saw that the holy Sabbath\nis, and will be, the separating wall between the true Israel of God\nand unbelievers; and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite\nthe hearts of God\u2019s dear, waiting saints.\nI saw that God had children who do not see and keep the Sabbath.\nThey have not rejected the light upon it. And at the commencement\nof the time of trouble, we were filled with the Holy Ghost as we went\nforth and proclaimed the Sabbath more fully. [See page 85.] This\nenraged the churches and nominal Adventists, [see also appendix.]\nas they could not refute the Sabbath truth. And at this time God\u2019s\nchosen all saw clearly that we had the truth, and they came out and\nendured the persecution with us. I saw the sword, famine, pestilence, [34]\nand great confusion in the land. The wicked thought that we had\nbrought the judgments upon them, and they rose up and took counsel\nto rid the earth of us, thinking that then the evil would be stayed.\nIn the time of trouble we all fled from the cities and villages, but\nwere pursued by the wicked, who entered the houses of the saints\nwith a sword. They raised the sword to kill us, but it broke, and\nfell as powerless as a straw. Then we all cried day and night for\ndeliverance, and the cry came up before God. The sun came up,\nand the moon stood still. The streams ceased to flow. Dark, heavy\nclouds came up and clashed against each other. But there was one\nclear place of settled glory, whence came the voice of God like many\nwaters, which shook the heavens and the earth. The sky opened and\nshut and was in commotion. The mountains shook like a reed in the\nwind, and cast out ragged rocks all around. The sea boiled like a pot\nand cast out stones upon the land. And as God spoke the day and\nthe hour of Jesus\u2019 coming and delivered the everlasting covenant\nto His people, He spoke one sentence, and then paused, while the\n50 Early Writings\nwords were rolling through the earth. The Israel of God stood with\ntheir eyes fixed upward, listening to the words as they came from the\nmouth of Jehovah, and rolled through the earth like peals of loudest\nthunder. It was awfully solemn. And at the end of every sentence the\nsaints shouted, \u201cGlory! Alleluia!\u201d Their countenances were lighted\nup with the glory of God; and they shone with the glory, as did the\nface of Moses when he came down from Sinai. The wicked could\nnot look on them for the glory. And when the never-ending blessing\nwas pronounced on those who had honored God in keeping His\nSabbath holy, there was a mighty shout of victory over the beast and\nover his image.\nThen commenced the jubilee, when the land should rest. I saw[35]\nthe pious slave rise in triumph and victory and shake off the chains\nthat bound him, while his wicked master was in confusion and knew\nnot what to do; for the wicked could not understand the words of the\nvoice of God. Soon appeared the great white cloud. It looked more\nlovely than ever before. On it sat the Son of man. At first we did not\nsee Jesus on the cloud, but as it drew near the earth we could behold\nHis lovely person. This cloud, when it first appeared, was the sign of\nthe Son of man in heaven. The voice of the Son of God called forth\nthe sleeping saints, clothed with glorious immortality. The living\nsaints were changed in a moment and were caught up with them into\nthe cloudy chariot. It looked all over glorious as it rolled upward. On\neither side of the chariot were wings, and beneath it wheels. And as\nthe chariot rolled upward, the wheels cried, \u201cHoly,\u201d and the wings,\nas they moved, cried, \u201cHoly,\u201d and the retinue of holy angels around\nthe cloud cried, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty!\u201d And the\nsaints in the cloud cried, \u201cGlory! Alleluia!\u201d And the chariot rolled\nupward to the Holy City. Jesus threw open the gates of the golden\ncity and led us in. Here we were made welcome, for we had kept\nthe \u201ccommandments of God,\u201d and had a \u201cright to the tree of life.\u201d\nThe Sealing [36]\nAt the commencement of the holy Sabbath, January 5, 1849,\nwe engaged in prayer with Brother Belden\u2019s family at Rocky Hill,\nConnecticut, and the Holy Ghost fell upon us. I was taken off in\nvision to the most holy place, where I saw Jesus still interceding for\nIsrael. On the bottom of His garment was a bell and a pomegranate.\nThen I saw that Jesus would not leave the most holy place until\nevery case was decided either for salvation or destruction, and that\nthe wrath of God could not come until Jesus had finished His work in\nthe most holy place, laid off His priestly attire, and clothed Himself\nwith the garments of vengeance. Then Jesus will step out from\nbetween the Father and man, and God will keep silence no longer,\nbut pour out His wrath on those who have rejected His truth. I saw\nthat the anger of the nations, the wrath of God, and the time to judge\nthe dead were separate and distinct, one following the other, also that\nMichael had not stood up, and that the time of trouble, such as never\nwas, had not yet commenced. The nations are now getting angry,\nbut when our High Priest has finished His work in the sanctuary, He\nwill stand up, put on the garments of vengeance, and then the seven\nlast plagues will be poured out.\nI saw that the four angels would hold the four winds until Jesus\u2019\nwork was done in the sanctuary, and then will come the seven last\nplagues. These plagues enraged the wicked against the righteous;\nthey thought that we had brought the judgments of God upon them,\nand that if they could rid the earth of us, the plagues would then be\nstayed. A decree went forth to slay the saints, which caused them [37]\nto cry day and night for deliverance. This was the time of Jacob\u2019s\ntrouble. Then all the saints cried out with anguish of spirit, and were\ndelivered by the voice of God. The 144,000 triumphed. Their faces\nwere lighted up with the glory of God. Then I was shown a company\nwho were howling in agony. On their garments was written in large\ncharacters, \u201cThou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting.\u201d I\nasked who this company were. The angel said, \u201cThese are they who\n51\n52 Early Writings\nhave once kept the Sabbath and have given it up.\u201d I heard them cry\nwith a loud voice, \u201cWe have believed in Thy coming, and taught it\nwith energy.\u201d And while they were speaking, their eyes would fall\nupon their garments and see the writing, and then they would wail\naloud. I saw that they had drunk of the deep waters, and fouled the\nresidue with their feet\u2014trodden the Sabbath underfoot\u2014and that\nwas why they were weighed in the balance and found wanting.\nThen my attending angel directed me to the city again, where I\nsaw four angels winging their way to the gate of the city. They were\njust presenting the golden card to the angel at the gate when I saw\nanother angel flying swiftly from the direction of the most excellent\nglory, and crying with a loud voice to the other angels, and waving\nsomething up and down in his hand. I asked my attending angel for\nan explanation of what I saw. He told me that I could see no more\nthen, but he would shortly show me what those things that I then\nsaw meant.\nSabbath afternoon one of our number was sick, and requested\nprayers that he might be healed. We all united in applying to the\nPhysician who never lost a case, and while healing power came\ndown, and the sick was healed, the Spirit fell upon me, and I was\ntaken off in vision.\nI saw four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and were on[38]\ntheir way to accomplish it. Jesus was clothed with priestly garments.\nHe gazed in pity on the remnant, then raised His hands, and with a\nvoice of deep pity cried, \u201cMy blood, Father, My blood, My blood,\nMy blood!\u201d Then I saw an exceeding bright light come from God,\nwho sat upon the great white throne, and was shed all about Jesus.\nThen I saw an angel with a commission from Jesus, swiftly flying\nto the four angels who had a work to do on the earth, and waving\nsomething up and down in his hand, and crying with a loud voice,\n\u201cHold! Hold! Hold! Hold ! until the servants of God are sealed in\ntheir foreheads.\u201d\nI asked my accompanying angel the meaning of what I heard,\nand what the four angels were about to do. He said to me that it was\nGod that restrained the powers, and that He gave His angels charge\nover things on the earth; that the four angels had power from God\nto hold the four winds, and that they were about to let them go; but\nwhile their hands were loosening, and the four winds were about\nSealing 53\nto blow, the merciful eye of Jesus gazed on the remnant that were\nnot sealed, and He raised His hands to the Father and pleaded with\nHim that He had spilled His blood for them. Then another angel was\ncommissioned to fly swiftly to the four angels and bid them hold,\nuntil the servants of God were sealed with the seal of the living God\nin their foreheads.\nGod\u2019s Love for His People[39]\nI have seen the tender love that God has for His people, and it is\nvery great. I saw angels over the saints with their wings spread about\nthem. Each saint had an attending angel. If the saints wept through\ndiscouragement, or were in danger, the angels that ever attended\nthem would fly quickly upward to carry the tidings, and the angels in\nthe city would cease to sing. Then Jesus would commission another\nangel to descend to encourage, watch over, and try to keep them\nfrom going out of the narrow path; but if they did not take heed\nto the watchful care of these angels, and would not be comforted\nby them, but continued to go astray, the angels would look sad and\nweep. They would bear the tidings upward, and all the angels in the\ncity would weep, and then with a loud voice say, \u201cAmen.\u201d But if the\nsaints fixed their eyes upon the prize before them and glorified God\nby praising Him, then the angels would bear the glad tidings to the\ncity, and the angels in the city would touch their golden harps and\nsing with a loud voice, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d and the heavenly arches would\nring with their lovely songs.\nThere is perfect order and harmony in the Holy City. All the\nangels that are commissioned to visit the earth hold a golden card,\nwhich they present to the angels at the gates of the city as they pass\nin and out. Heaven is a good place. I long to be there and behold\nmy lovely Jesus, who gave His life for me, and be changed into His\nglorious image. Oh, for language to express the glory of the bright\nworld to come! I thirst for the living streams that make glad the city\nof our God.\nThe Lord has given me a view of other worlds. Wings were\ngiven me, and an angel attended me from the city to a place that was\nbright and glorious. The grass of the place was living green, and\nthe birds there warbled a sweet song. The inhabitants of the place[40]\nwere of all sizes; they were noble, majestic, and lovely. They bore\nthe express image of Jesus, and their countenances beamed with\nholy joy, expressive of the freedom and happiness of the place. I\n54\nGod\u2019s Love for His People 55\nasked one of them why they were so much more lovely than those\non the earth. The reply was, \u201cWe have lived in strict obedience to the\ncommandments of God, and have not fallen by disobedience, like\nthose on the earth.\u201d Then I saw two trees, one looked much like the\ntree of life in the city. The fruit of both looked beautiful, but of one\nthey could not eat. They had power to eat of both, but were forbidden\nto eat of one. Then my attending angel said to me, \u201cNone in this\nplace have tasted of the forbidden tree; but if they should eat, they\nwould fall.\u201d Then I was taken to a world which had seven moons.\nThere I saw good old Enoch, who had been translated. On his right\narm he bore a glorious palm, and on each leaf was written \u201cVictory.\u201d\nAround his head was a dazzling white wreath, and leaves on the\nwreath, and in the middle of each leaf was written \u201cPurity,\u201d and\naround the wreath were stones of various colors, that shone brighter\nthan the stars, and cast a reflection upon the letters and magnified\nthem. On the back part of his head was a bow that confined the\nwreath, and upon the bow was written \u201cHoliness.\u201d Above the wreath\nwas a lovely crown that shone brighter than the sun. I asked him\nif this was the place he was taken to from the earth. He said, \u201cIt\nis not; the city is my home, and I have come to visit this place.\u201d\nHe moved about the place as if perfectly at home. I begged of my\nattending angel to let me remain in that place. I could not bear the\nthought of coming back to this dark world again. Then the angel said,\n\u201cYou must go back, and if you are faithful, you, with the 144,000,\nshall have the privilege of visiting all the worlds and viewing the\nhandiwork of God.\u201d\nShaking of the Powers of Heaven[41]\nDecember 16, 1848, the Lord gave me a view of the shaking of\nthe powers of the heavens. I saw that when the Lord said \u201cheaven,\u201d\nin giving the signs recorded by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, He meant\nheaven, and when He said \u201cearth\u201d He meant earth. The powers\nof heaven are the sun, moon, and stars. They rule in the heavens.\nThe powers of earth are those that rule on the earth. The powers of\nheaven will be shaken at the voice of God. Then the sun, moon, and\nstars will be moved out of their places. They will not pass away, but\nbe shaken by the voice of God.\nDark, heavy clouds came up and clashed against each other. The\natmosphere parted and rolled back; then we could look up through\nthe open space in Orion, whence came the voice of God. The Holy\nCity will come down through that open space. I saw that the powers\nof earth are now being shaken and that events come in order. War,\nand rumors of war, sword, famine, and pestilence are first to shake\nthe powers of earth, then the voice of God will shake the sun, moon,\nand stars, and this earth also. I saw that the shaking of the powers in\nEurope is not, as some teach, the shaking of the powers of heaven,\nbut it is the shaking of the angry nations.\n56\nThe Open and the Shut Door\nSabbath, March 24, 1849, we had a sweet and very interesting [42]\nmeeting with the brethren at Topsham, Maine. The Holy Ghost was\npoured out upon us, and I was taken off in the Spirit to the city of\nthe living God. Then I was shown that the commandments of God\nand the testimony of Jesus Christ relating to the shut door could not\nbe separated, and that the time for the commandments of God to\nshine out with all their importance, and for God\u2019s people to be tried\non the Sabbath truth, was when the door was opened in the most\nholy place in the heavenly sanctuary, where the ark is, in which are\ncontained the ten commandments. This door was not opened until\nthe mediation of Jesus was finished in the holy place of the sanctuary\nin 1844. Then Jesus rose up and shut the door of the holy place, and\nopened the door into the most holy, and passed within the second\nveil, where He now stands by the ark, and where the faith of Israel\nnow reaches.\nI saw that Jesus had shut the door of the holy place, and no man\ncan open it; and that He had opened the door into the most holy,\nand no man can shut it (Revelation 3:7, 8); [see page 86. See also\nappendix.] and that since Jesus has opened the door into the most\nholy place, which contains the ark, the commandments have been\nshining out to God\u2019s people, and they are being tested on the Sabbath\nquestion.\nI saw that the present test on the Sabbath could not come until\nthe mediation of Jesus in the holy place was finished and He had\npassed within the second veil; therefore Christians who fell asleep\nbefore the door was opened into the most holy, when the midnight\ncry was finished, at the seventh month, 1844, and who had not kept [43]\nthe true Sabbath, now rest in hope; for they had not the light and the\ntest on the Sabbath which we now have since that door was opened.\nI saw that Satan was tempting some of God\u2019s people on this point.\nBecause so many good Christians have fallen asleep in the triumphs\n57\n58 Early Writings\nof faith and have not kept the true Sabbath, they were doubting about\nits being a test for us now.\nThe enemies of the present truth have been trying to open the\ndoor of the holy place, that Jesus has shut, and to close the door\nof the most holy place, which He opened in 1844, where the ark\nis, containing the two tables of stone on which are written the ten\ncommandments by the finger of Jehovah.\nSatan is now using every device in this sealing time to keep the\nminds of God\u2019s people from the present truth and to cause them to\nwaver. I saw a covering that God was drawing over His people to\nprotect them in the time of trouble; and every soul that was decided\non the truth and was pure in heart was to be covered with the covering\nof the Almighty.\nSatan knew this, and he was at work in mighty power to keep\nthe minds of as many people as he possibly could wavering and\nunsettled on the truth. I saw that the mysterious knocking in New\nYork and other places was the power of Satan, and that such things\nwould be more and more common, clothed in a religious garb so\nas to lull the deceived to greater security and to draw the minds of\nGod\u2019s people, if possible, to those things and cause them to doubt\nthe teachings and power of the Holy Ghost. [See page 86. See also\nappendix.]\nI saw that Satan was working through agents in a number of\nways. He was at work through ministers who have rejected the truth\nand are given over to strong delusions to believe a lie that they might[44]\nbe damned. While they were preaching or praying, some would fall\nprostrate and helpless, not by the power of the Holy Ghost, but by\nthe power of Satan breathed upon these agents, and through them to\nthe people. While preaching, praying, or conversing, some professed\nAdventists who had rejected present truth used mesmerism to gain\nadherents, and the people would rejoice in this influence, for they\nthought it was the Holy Ghost. Some even that used it were so far\nin the darkness and deception of the devil that they thought it was\nthe power of God, given them to exercise. They had made God\naltogether such a one as themselves and had valued His power as a\nthing of nought.\nSome of these agents of Satan were affecting the bodies of some\nof the saints\u2014those whom they could not deceive and draw away\nOpen and the Shut Door 59\nfrom the truth by a Satanic influence. Oh, that all could get a view\nof it as God revealed it to me, that they might know more of the\nwiles of Satan and be on their guard! I saw that Satan was at work\nin these ways to distract, deceive, and draw away God\u2019s people, just\nnow in this sealing time. I saw some who were not standing stiffly\nfor present truth. Their knees were trembling, and their feet sliding,\nbecause they were not firmly planted on the truth, and the covering\nof Almighty God could not be drawn over them while they were\nthus trembling.\nSatan was trying his every art to hold them where they were,\nuntil the sealing was past, until the covering was drawn over God\u2019s\npeople, and they left without a shelter from the burning wrath of\nGod, in the seven last plagues. God has begun to draw this covering\nover His people, and it will soon be drawn over all who are to have\na shelter in the day of slaughter. God will work in power for His\npeople; and Satan will be permitted to work also.\nI saw that the mysterious signs and wonders and false reforma- [45]\ntions would increase and spread. The reformations that were shown\nme were not reformations from error to truth. My accompanying\nangel bade me look for the travail of soul for sinners as used to\nbe. I looked, but could not see it; for the time for their salvation is\npast. [The writer of these words did not understand them as teaching\nthat the time for the salvation of all sinners was past. At the very\ntime when these things were written she herself was laboring for the\nsalvation of sinners, as she has been doing ever since.\nHer understanding of the matter as it has been presented to her\nis given in the following paragraphs, the first published in 1854, and\nthe second in 1888:\n\u201cThe \u2018false reformations\u2019 here referred to are yet to be more fully\nseen. The view relates more particularly to those who have heard\nand rejected the light of the advent doctrine. They are given over to\nstrong delusions. Such will not have \u2018the travail of soul for sinners\u2019\nas formerly. Having rejected the advent, and being given over to the\ndelusions of Satan, \u2018the time for their salvation is past.\u2019 This does\nnot, however, relate to those who have not heard and rejected the\ndoctrine of the second advent.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a fearful thing to treat lightly the truth which has convinced\nour understanding and touched our hearts. We cannot with impunity\n60 Early Writings\nreject the warnings which God in mercy sends us. A message was\nsent from heaven to the world in Noah\u2019s day, and the salvation of\nmen depended upon the manner in which they treated that message.\nBecause they rejected the warning, the Spirit of God was withdrawn\nfrom the sinful race, and they perished in the waters of the flood.\nIn the time of Abraham, mercy ceased to plead with the guilty\ninhabitants of Sodom, and all but Lot with his wife and two daughters\nwere consumed by the fire sent down from heaven. So in the days\nof Christ. The Son of God declared to the unbelieving Jews of that\ngeneration, \u2018Your house is left unto you desolate.\u2019 Looking down to\nthe last days, the same infinite power declares, concerning those who\n\u2018received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved,\u2019 \u2018For this\ncause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe\na lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but\nhad pleasure in unrighteousness.\u2019 As they reject the teachings of His\nWord, God withdraws His Spirit, and leaves them to the deceptions\nwhich they love.\u201d]\nThe Trial of our Faith [46]\nIn this time of trial we need to be encouraged and comforted by\none another. The temptations of Satan are greater now than ever\nbefore, for he knows that his time is short and that very soon every\ncase will be decided, either for life or for death. It is no time now to\nsink down beneath discouragement and trial; we must bear up under\nall our afflictions and trust wholly in the Almighty God of Jacob.\nThe Lord has shown me that His grace is sufficient for all our trials;\nand although they are greater than ever before, yet if we trust wholly\nin God, we can overcome every temptation and through His grace\ncome off victorious.\nIf we overcome our trials and get victory over the temptations of\nSatan, then we endure the trial of our faith, which is more precious\nthan gold, and are stronger and better prepared to meet the next. But\nif we sink down and give way to the temptations of Satan, we shall\ngrow weaker and get no reward for the trial and shall not be so well\nprepared for the next. In this way we shall grow weaker and weaker,\nuntil we are led captive by Satan at his will. We must have on the\nwhole armor of God and be ready at any moment for a conflict with\nthe powers of darkness. When temptations and trials rush in upon\nus, let us go to God and agonize with Him in prayer. He will not\nturn us away empty, but will give us grace and strength to overcome,\nand to break the power of the enemy. Oh, that all could see these\nthings in their true light and endure hardness as good soldiers of\nJesus! Then would Israel move forward, strong in God, and in the\npower of His might.\nGod has shown me that He gave His people a bitter cup to drink, [47]\nto purify and cleanse them. It is a bitter draught, and they can make\nit still more bitter by murmuring, complaining, and repining. But\nthose who receive it thus must have another draught, for the first does\nnot have its designed effect upon the heart. And if the second does\nnot effect the work, then they must have another, and another, until\nit does have its designed effect, or they will be left filthy, impure\n61\n62 Early Writings\nin heart. I saw that this bitter cup can be sweetened by patience,\nendurance, and prayer, and that it will have its designed effect upon\nthe hearts of those who thus receive it, and God will be honored and\nglorified. It is no small thing to be a Christian and to be owned and\napproved of God. The Lord has shown me some who profess the\npresent truth, whose lives do not correspond with their profession.\nThey have the standard of piety altogether too low, and they come\nfar short of Bible holiness. Some engage in vain and unbecoming\nconversation, and others give way to the risings of self. We must\nnot expect to please ourselves, live and act like the world, have its\npleasures, and enjoy the company of those who are of the world, and\nreign with Christ in glory.\nWe must be partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings here if we would\nshare in His glory hereafter. If we seek our own interest, how we can\nbest please ourselves, instead of seeking to please God and advance\nHis precious, suffering cause, we shall dishonor God and the holy\ncause we profess to love. We have but a little space of time left in\nwhich to work for God. Nothing should be too dear to sacrifice for\nthe salvation of the scattered and torn flock of Jesus. Those who\nmake a covenant with God by sacrifice now will soon be gathered\nhome to share a rich reward and possess the new kingdom forever\nand ever.\nOh, let us live wholly for the Lord and show by a well-ordered[48]\nlife and godly conversation that we have been with Jesus and are His\nmeek and lowly followers. We must work while the day lasts, for\nwhen the dark night of trouble and anguish comes, it will be too late\nto work for God. Jesus is in His holy temple and will now accept our\nsacrifices, our prayers, and our confessions of faults and sins and\nwill pardon all the transgressions of Israel, that they may be blotted\nout before He leaves the sanctuary. When Jesus leaves the sanctuary,\nthen they who are holy and righteous will be holy and righteous still;\nfor all their sins will then be blotted out, and they will be sealed with\nthe seal of the living God. But those that are unjust and filthy will be\nunjust and filthy still; for then there will be no Priest in the sanctuary\nto offer their sacrifices, their confessions, and their prayers before\nthe Father\u2019s throne. Therefore what is done to rescue souls from the\ncoming storm of wrath must be done before Jesus leaves the most\nholy place of the heavenly sanctuary.\nTrial of our Faith 63\n* * * * *\nTo the \u201cLittle Flock\u201d\nDear Brethren,\nThe Lord gave me a view, January 26, 1850, which I will relate.\nI saw that some of the people of God are stupid and dormant and but\nhalf awake; they do not realize the time we are now living in, and\nthat the man with the \u201cdirt brush\u201d [see \u201cWilliam Miller\u2019s dream,\u201d\npage 81.] has entered, and that some are in danger of being swept\naway. I begged of Jesus to save them, to spare them a little longer,\nand let them see their awful danger, that they might get ready before\nit should be forever too late. The angel said, \u201cDestruction is coming[49]\nlike a mighty whirlwind.\u201d I begged of the angel to pity and to save\nthose who loved this world, who were attached to their possessions\nand were not willing to cut loose from them and sacrifice to speed\nthe messengers on their way to feed the hungry sheep who were\nperishing for want of spiritual food.\nAs I viewed poor souls dying for want of the present truth, and\nsome who professed to believe the truth were letting them die by\nwithholding the necessary means to carry forward the work of God,\nthe sight was too painful, and I begged of the angel to remove it\nfrom me. I saw that when the cause of God called for some of their\nproperty, like the young man who came to Jesus (Matthew 19:16-22)\nthey went away sorrowful, and that soon the overflowing scourge\nwould pass over and sweep their possessions all away, and then it\nwould be too late to sacrifice earthly goods, and lay up a treasure in\nheaven.\nI then saw the glorious Redeemer, beautiful and lovely; that He\nleft the realms of glory and came to this dark and lonely world to\ngive His precious life and die, the just for the unjust. He bore the\ncruel mocking and scourging, wore the plaited crown of thorns, and\nsweat great drops of blood in the garden, while the burden of the\nsins of the whole world was upon Him. The angel asked, \u201cWhat\nfor?\u201d Oh, I saw and knew that it was for us; for our sins He suffered\nall this, that by His precious blood He might redeem us unto God!\n64\nTo the \u201cLittle Flock\u201d 65\nThen again was held up before me those who were not willing\nto dispose of this world\u2019s goods to save perishing souls by sending\nthem the truth while Jesus stands before the Father pleading His\nblood, His sufferings, and His death for them; and while God\u2019s\nmessengers are waiting, ready to carry them the saving truth that [50]\nthey might be sealed with the seal of the living God. It is hard for\nsome who profess to believe the present truth to do even so little as\nto hand the messengers God\u2019s own money that He has lent them to\nbe stewards over.\nThe suffering Jesus, His love so deep as to lead Him to give His\nlife for man, was again held up before me; also the lives of those\nwho professed to be His followers, who had this world\u2019s goods, but\nconsidered it so great a thing to help the cause of salvation. The\nangel said, \u201cCan such enter heaven?\u201d Another angel answered, \u201cNo,\nnever, never, never. Those who are not interested in the cause of God\non earth can never sing the song of redeeming love above.\u201d I saw that\nthe quick work that God was doing on the earth would soon be cut\nshort in righteousness and that the messengers must speed swiftly on\ntheir way to search out the scattered flock. An angel said, \u201cAre all\nmessengers?\u201d Another answered, \u201cNo, no; God\u2019s messengers have a\nmessage.\u201d\nI saw that the cause of God had been hindered and dishonored\nby some traveling who had no message from God. [see Appendix.]\nSuch will have to give an account to God for every dollar they have\nused in traveling where it was not their duty to go, because that\nmoney might have helped on the cause of God; and for the lack of\nthe spiritual food that might have been given them by God\u2019s called\nand chosen messengers, had they had the means, souls have starved\nand died. I saw that those who have strength to labor with their hands\nand help sustain the cause were as accountable for their strength as\nothers were for their property.\nThe mighty shaking has commenced and will go on, and all will\nbe shaken out who are not willing to take a bold and unyielding stand\nfor the truth and to sacrifice for God and His cause. The angel said,\n\u201cThink ye that any will be compelled to sacrifice? No, no. It must [51]\nbe a freewill offering. It will take all to buy the field.\u201d I cried to God\nto spare His people, some of whom were fainting and dying. Then I\nsaw that the judgments of the Almighty were speedily coming, and\n66 Early Writings\nI begged of the angel to speak in his language to the people. Said\nhe, \u201cAll the thunders and lightnings of Mount Sinai would not move\nthose who will not be moved by the plain truths of the Word of God,\nneither would an angel\u2019s message awake them.\u201d\nI then beheld the beauty and loveliness of Jesus. His robe was\nwhiter than the whitest white. No language can describe His glory\nand exalted loveliness. All, all who keep the commandments of God,\nwill enter in through the gates into the city and have right to the\ntree of life and ever be in the presence of the lovely Jesus, whose\ncountenance shines brighter than the sun at noonday.\nI was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden. They partook of the\nforbidden tree and were driven from the garden, and then the flaming\nsword was placed around the tree of life, lest they should partake of\nits fruit and be immortal sinners. The tree of life was to perpetuate\nimmortality. I heard an angel ask, \u201cWho of the family of Adam have\npassed the flaming sword and have partaken of the tree of life?\u201d I\nheard another angel answer, \u201cNot one of Adam\u2019s family has passed\nthat flaming sword and partaken of that tree; therefore there is not\nan immortal sinner. The soul that sinneth it shall die an everlasting\ndeath\u2014a death that will last forever, from which there will be no\nhope of a resurrection; and then the wrath of God will be appeased.\n\u201cThe saints will rest in the Holy City and reign as kings and\npriests one thousand years; then Jesus will descend with the saints\nupon the Mount of Olives, and the mount will part asunder and\nbecome a mighty plain for the Paradise of God to rest upon. The rest[52]\nof the earth will not be cleansed until the end of the one thousand\nyears, when the wicked dead are raised, and gather up around the\ncity. The feet of the wicked will never desecrate the earth made new.\nFire will come down from God out of heaven and devour them\u2014\nburn them up root and branch. Satan is the root, and his children are\nthe branches. The same fire that will devour the wicked will purify\nthe earth.\u201d\n* * * * *\nThe Last Plagues and the Judgment\nAt the general conference of believers in the present truth, held\nat Sutton, Vermont, September, 1850, I was shown that the seven\nlast plagues will be poured out after Jesus leaves the sanctuary. Said\nthe angel, \u201cIt is the wrath of God and the Lamb that causes the\ndestruction or death of the wicked. At the voice of God the saints\nwill be mighty and terrible as an army with banners, but they will not\nthen execute the judgment written. The execution of the judgment\nwill be at the close of the one thousand years.\u201d\nAfter the saints are changed to immortality and caught up to-\ngether with Jesus, after they receive their harps, their robes, and\ntheir crowns, and enter the city, Jesus and the saints sit in judgment.\nThe books are opened\u2014the book of life and the book of death. The\nbook of life contains the good deeds of the saints; and the book of\ndeath contains the evil deeds of the wicked. These books are com-\npared with the statute book, the Bible, and according to that men are\njudged. The saints, in unison with Jesus, pass their judgment upon\nthe wicked dead. \u201cBehold ye,\u201d said the angel, \u201cthe saints, in unison\nwith Jesus, sit in judgment, and mete out to the wicked according [53]\nto the deeds done in the body, and that which they must receive at\nthe execution of the judgment is set off against their names.\u201d This, I\nsaw, was the work of the saints with Jesus through the one thousand\nyears in the Holy City before it descends to the earth. Then at the\nclose of the one thousand years, Jesus, with the angels and all the\nsaints, leaves the Holy City, and while He is descending to the earth\nwith them, the wicked dead are raised, and then the very men that\n\u201cpierced Him,\u201d being raised, will see Him afar off in all His glory,\nthe angels and saints with Him, and will wail because of Him. They\nwill see the prints of the nails in His hands and in His feet, and where\nthey thrust the spear into His side. The prints of the nails and the\nspear will then be His glory. It is at the close of the one thousand\nyears that Jesus stands upon the Mount of Olives, and the mount\nparts asunder and becomes a mighty plain. Those who flee at that\n67\n68 Early Writings\ntime are the wicked, who have just been raised. Then the Holy City\ncomes down and settles on the plain. Satan then imbues the wicked\nwith his spirit. He flatters them that the army in the city is small,\nand that his army is large, and that they can overcome the saints and\ntake the city.\nWhile Satan was rallying his army, the saints were in the city,\nbeholding the beauty and glory of the Paradise of God. Jesus was at\ntheir head, leading them. All at once the lovely Saviour was gone\nfrom our company; but soon we heard His lovely voice, saying,\n\u201cCome, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for\nyou from the foundation of the world.\u201d We gathered about Jesus,\nand just as He closed the gates of the city, the curse was pronounced\nupon the wicked. The gates were shut. Then the saints used their\nwings and mounted to the top of the wall of the city. Jesus was also\nwith them; His crown looked brilliant and glorious. It was a crown[54]\nwithin a crown, seven in number. The crowns of the saints were of\nthe most pure gold, decked with stars. Their faces shone with glory,\nfor they were in the express image of Jesus; and as they arose and\nmoved all together to the top of the city, I was enraptured with the\nsight.\nThen the wicked saw what they had lost; and fire was breathed\nfrom God upon them and consumed them. This was the execution of\nthe judgment. The wicked then received according as the saints, in\nunison with Jesus, had meted out to them during the one thousand\nyears. The same fire from God that consumed the wicked purified\nthe whole earth. The broken, ragged mountains melted with fervent\nheat, the atmosphere also, and all the stubble was consumed. Then\nour inheritance opened before us, glorious and beautiful, and we\ninherited the whole earth made new. We all shouted with a loud\nvoice, \u201cGlory; Alleluia!\u201d\n* * * * *\nEnd of the 2300 Days\nI saw a throne, and on it sat the Father and the Son. I gazed on\nJesus\u2019 countenance and admired His lovely person. The Father\u2019s\nperson I could not behold, for a cloud of glorious light covered Him.\nI asked Jesus if His Father had a form like Himself. He said He had,\nbut I could not behold it, for said He, \u201cIf you should once behold the\nglory of His person, you would cease to exist.\u201d Before the throne\nI saw the Advent people\u2014the church and the world. I saw two\ncompanies, one bowed down before the throne, deeply interested,\nwhile the other stood uninterested and careless. Those who were\nbowed before the throne would offer up their prayers and look to\nJesus; then He would look to His Father, and appear to be pleading\nwith Him. A light would come from the Father to the Son and from [55]\nthe Son to the praying company. Then I saw an exceeding bright\nlight come from the Father to the Son, and from the Son it waved\nover the people before the throne. But few would receive this great\nlight. Many came out from under it and immediately resisted it;\nothers were careless and did not cherish the light, and it moved off\nfrom them. Some cherished it, and went and bowed down with the\nlittle praying company. This company all received the light and\nrejoiced in it, and their countenances shone with its glory.\nI saw the Father rise from the throne, [see page 92.] and in a\nflaming chariot go into the holy of holies within the veil, and sit\ndown. Then Jesus rose up from the throne, and the most of those\nwho were bowed down arose with Him. I did not see one ray of\nlight pass from Jesus to the careless multitude after He arose, and\nthey were left in perfect darkness. Those who arose when Jesus did,\nkept their eyes fixed on Him as He left the throne and led them out a\nlittle way. Then He raised His right arm, and we heard His lovely\nvoice saying, \u201cWait here; I am going to My Father to receive the\nkingdom; keep your garments spotless, and in a little while I will\nreturn from the wedding and receive you to Myself.\u201d Then a cloudy\nchariot, with wheels like flaming fire, surrounded by angels, came\n69\n70 Early Writings\nto where Jesus was. He stepped into the chariot and was borne to\nthe holiest, where the Father sat. There I beheld Jesus, a great High\nPriest, standing before the Father. On the hem of His garment was a\nbell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate. Those who rose\nup with Jesus would send up their faith to Him in the holiest, and\npray, \u201cMy Father, give us Thy Spirit.\u201d Then Jesus would breathe\nupon them the Holy Ghost. In that breath was light, power, and\nmuch love, joy, and peace.\nI turned to look at the company who were still bowed before the[56]\nthrone; they did not know that Jesus had left it. Satan appeared to be\nby the throne, trying to carry on the work of God. I saw them look\nup to the throne, and pray, \u201cFather, give us Thy Spirit.\u201d Satan would\nthen breathe upon them an unholy influence; in it there was light and\nmuch power, but no sweet love, joy, and peace. Satan\u2019s object was\nto keep them deceived and to draw back and deceive God\u2019s children.\n* * * * *\nDuty in View of the Time of Trouble\nThe Lord has shown me repeatedly that it is contrary to the Bible\nto make any provision for our temporal wants in the time of trouble.\nI saw that if the saints had food laid up by them or in the field in\nthe time of trouble, when sword, famine, and pestilence are in the\nland, it would be taken from them by violent hands and strangers\nwould reap their fields. Then will be the time for us to trust wholly\nin God, and He will sustain us. I saw that our bread and water will\nbe sure at that time, and that we shall not lack or suffer hunger; for\nGod is able to spread a table for us in the wilderness. If necessary\nHe would send ravens to feed us, as He did to feed Elijah, or rain\nmanna from heaven, as He did for the Israelites.\nHouses and lands will be of no use to the saints in the time of\ntrouble, for they will then have to flee before infuriated mobs, and\nat that time their possessions cannot be disposed of to advance the\ncause of present truth. I was shown that it is the will of God that the\nsaints should cut loose from every encumbrance before the time of [57]\ntrouble comes, and make a covenant with God through sacrifice. If\nthey have their property on the altar and earnestly inquire of God for\nduty, He will teach them when to dispose of these things. Then they\nwill be free in the time of trouble and have no clogs to weigh them\ndown.\nI saw that if any held on to their property and did not inquire\nof the Lord as to their duty, He would not make duty known, and\nthey would be permitted to keep their property, and in the time of\ntrouble it would come up before them like a mountain to crush them,\nand they would try to dispose of it, but would not be able. I heard\nsome mourn like this: \u201cThe cause was languishing, God\u2019s people\nwere starving for the truth, and we made no effort to supply the lack;\nnow our property is useless. Oh, that we had let it go, and laid up\ntreasure in heaven!\u201d I saw that a sacrifice did not increase, but it\ndecreased and was consumed. I also saw that God had not required\nall of His people to dispose of their property at the same time; but if\n71\n72 Early Writings\nthey desired to be taught, He would teach them, in a time of need,\nwhen to sell and how much to sell. Some have been required to\ndispose of their property in times past to sustain the Advent cause,\nwhile others have been permitted to keep theirs until a time of need.\nThen, as the cause needs it, their duty is to sell.\nI saw that the message, \u201cSell that ye have, and give alms,\u201d has\nnot been given, by some, in its clear light, and the object of the\nwords of our Saviour has not been clearly presented. The object\nof selling is not to give to those who are able to labor and support\nthemselves, but to spread the truth. It is a sin to support and indulge\nin idleness those who are able to labor. Some have been zealous to\nattend all the meetings, not to glorify God, but for the \u201cloaves and\nfishes.\u201d Such would much better have been at home laboring with\ntheir hands, \u201cthe thing that is good,\u201d to supply the wants of their[58]\nfamilies and to have something to give to sustain the precious cause\nof present truth. Now is the time to lay up treasure in heaven and\nto set our hearts in order, ready for the time of trouble. Those only\nwho have clean hands and pure hearts will stand in that trying time.\nNow is the time for the law of God to be in our minds, foreheads,\nand written in our hearts.\nThe Lord has shown me the danger of letting our minds be filled\nwith worldly thoughts and cares. I saw that some minds are led\naway from present truth and a love of the Holy Bible by reading\nother exciting books; others are filled with perplexity and care for\nwhat they shall eat, drink, and wear. Some are looking too far off\nfor the coming of the Lord. Time has continued a few years longer\nthan they expected; therefore they think it may continue a few years\nmore, and in this way their minds are being led from present truth,\nout after the world. In these things I saw great danger; for if the\nmind is filled with other things, present truth is shut out, and there is\nno place in our foreheads for the seal of the living God. I saw that\nthe time for Jesus to be in the most holy place was nearly finished\nand that time can last but a very little longer. What leisure time we\nhave should be spent in searching the Bible, which is to judge us in\nthe last day.\nMy dear brethren and sisters, let the commandments of God and\nthe testimony of Jesus Christ be in your minds continually and let\nthem crowd out worldly thoughts and cares. When you lie down and\nDuty in View of the Time of Trouble 73\nwhen you rise up, let them be your meditation. Live and act wholly\nin reference to the coming of the Son of man. The sealing time is\nvery short, and will soon be over. Now is the time, while the four\nangels are holding the four winds, to make our calling and election\nsure.\n\u201cMysterious Rapping\u201d[59]\nAugust 24, 1850, I saw that the \u201cmysterious rapping\u201d was the\npower of Satan; some of it was directly from him, and some indi-\nrectly, through his agents, but it all proceeded from Satan. It was\nhis work that he accomplished in different ways; yet many in the\nchurches and the world were so enveloped in gross darkness that\nthey thought and held forth that it was the power of God. Said the\nangel, \u201cShould not a people seek unto their God? for the living to\nthe dead?\u201d Should the living go to the dead for knowledge? The\ndead know not anything. For the living God do ye go to the dead?\nThey have departed from the living God to converse with the dead\nwho know not anything. (See Isaiah 8:19, 20.).\nI saw that soon it would be considered blasphemy to speak\nagainst the rapping, and that it would spread more and more, that\nSatan\u2019s power would increase and some of his devoted followers\nwould have power to work miracles and even to bring down fire\nfrom heaven in the sight of men. I was shown that by the rapping\nand mesmerism these modern magicians would yet account for all\nthe miracles wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ, and that many would\nbelieve that all the mighty works of the Son of God when on earth\nwere accomplished by this same power. [When this view was given,\nspiritualism had but just arisen and was small; there were but few\nmediums. Since that time it has spread all over the world and counts\nits adherents by many millions. As a general thing, spiritualists have\ndenied the Bible and derided Christianity. Individuals have, at differ-\nent times, deplored this and protested against it, but they were so few\nthat no attention was paid to them. Now spiritualists are changing\ntheir method, and many call themselves \u201cChristian spiritualists,\u201d\nDeclaring that it will not answer to ignore religion, and affirming\nthat they have the true Christian faith. Bearing in mind, also, that\nmany prominent clergymen are in sympathy with spiritualism, we\nnow see the way open for the complete fulfillment of this prediction,\ngiven in 1850. Read also remarks by the author on page 86.] I was\n74\n\u201cMysterious Rapping\u201d 75\npointed back to the time of Moses and saw the signs and wonders [60]\nwhich God wrought through him before Pharaoh, most of which\nwere imitated by the magicians of Egypt; and that just before the\nfinal deliverance of the saints, God would work powerfully for His\npeople, and these modern magicians would be permitted to imitate\nthe work of God.\nThat time will soon come, and we shall have to keep hold of the\nstrong arm of Jehovah; for all these great signs and mighty wonders\nof the devil are designed to deceive God\u2019s people and overthrow\nthem. Our minds must be stayed upon God, and we must not fear the\nfear of the wicked, that is, fear what they fear, and reverence what\nthey reverence, but be bold and valiant for the truth. Could our eyes\nbe opened, we should see forms of evil angels around us, trying to\ninvent some new way to annoy and destroy us. And we should also\nsee angels of God guarding us from their power; for God\u2019s watchful\neye is ever over Israel for good, and He will protect and save His\npeople, if they put their trust in Him. When the enemy shall come in\nlike a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.\nSaid the angel, \u201cRemember, thou art on the enchanted ground.\u201d\nI saw that we must watch and have on the whole armor and take the\nshield of faith, and then we shall be able to stand, and the fiery darts\nof the wicked cannot harm us.\nThe Messengers[61]\n[See Appendix.]\nThe Lord has often given me a view of the situation and wants of\nthe scattered jewels who have not yet come to the light of the present\ntruth, and has shown that the messengers should speed their way to\nthem as fast as possible, to give them the light. Many all around\nus only need to have their prejudices removed and the evidences\nof our present position spread out before them from the Word, and\nthey will joyfully receive the present truth. The messengers should\nwatch for souls as they that must give account. Theirs must be a life\nof toil and anguish of spirit, while the weight of the precious but\noften-wounded cause of Christ rests upon them. They will have to\nlay aside worldly interests and comforts and make it their first object\nto do all in their power to advance the cause of present truth and\nsave perishing souls.\nThey will also have a rich reward. In their crowns of rejoicing\nthose who are rescued by them and finally saved will shine as stars\nforever and ever. And to all eternity they will enjoy the satisfaction\nof having done what they could in presenting the truth in its purity\nand beauty, so that souls fell in love with it, were sanctified through\nit, and availed themselves of the inestimable privilege of being made\nrich, and being washed in the blood of the Lamb and redeemed unto\nGod.\nI saw that the shepherds should consult those in whom they have\nreason to have confidence, those who have been in all the messages,\nand are firm in all the present truth, before they advocate new points\nof importance, which they may think the Bible sustains. Then the\nshepherds will be perfectly united and the union of the shepherds will[62]\nbe felt by the church. Such a course I saw would prevent unhappy\ndivisions, and then there would be no danger of the precious flock\nbeing divided and the sheep scattered without a shepherd.\n76\nMessengers 77\nI also saw that God had messengers that He would use in His\ncause, but they were not ready. They were too light and trifling to\nexert a good influence over the flock and did not feel the weight\nof the cause and the worth of souls as God\u2019s messengers must feel\nin order to effect good. Said the angel, \u201c Be ye clean that bear the\nvessels of the Lord. Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d\nThey can accomplish but little good unless they are wholly given up\nto God and feel the importance and solemnity of the last message of\nmercy that is now being given to the scattered flock. Some who are\nnot called of God are very willing to go with the message. But if they\nfelt the weight of the cause and the responsibilities of such a station,\nthey would feel to shrink back and say with the apostle, \u201cWho is\nsufficient for these things?\u201d One reason why they are so willing to\ngo is that God has not laid upon them the weight of the cause. Not\nall who proclaimed the first and the second angel\u2019s message are to\ngive the third, even after they fully embrace it, for some have been\nin so many errors and delusions that they can but just save their own\nsouls, and if they undertake to guide others, they will be the means\nof overthrowing them. But I saw that some who have formerly run\ndeep into fanaticism would be the first now to run before God sends\nthem, before they are purified from their past errors; having error\nmixed with the truth, they would feed the flock of God with it, and\nif they were suffered to go on, the flock would become sickly, and\ndistraction and death would follow. I saw that they would have to be\nsifted and sifted, until they were freed from all their errors, or they [63]\ncould never enter the kingdom. The messengers could not have that\nconfidence in the judgment and discernment of those who have been\nin errors and fanaticism that they could have in those who have been\nin the truth and not in extravagant errors. Many, also, are too apt to\nurge out into the field some who have but just professed the present\ntruth, who have much to learn and much to do before they can be\nright in the sight of God themselves, much less point out the way to\nothers.\nI saw the necessity of the messengers, especially, watching and\nchecking all fanaticism wherever they might see it rise. Satan is\npressing in on every side, and unless we watch for him, and have our\neyes open to his devices and snares, and have on the whole armor\nof God, the fiery darts of the wicked will hit us. There are many\n78 Early Writings\nprecious truths contained in the Word of God, but it is \u201cpresent truth\u201d\nthat the flock needs now. I have seen the danger of the messengers\nrunning off from the important points of present truth, to dwell upon\nsubjects that are not calculated to unite the flock and sanctify the\nsoul. Satan will here take every possible advantage to injure the\ncause.\nBut such subjects as the sanctuary, in connection with the 2300\ndays, the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, are perfectly\ncalculated to explain the past Advent movement and show what\nour present position is, establish the faith of the doubting, and give\ncertainty to the glorious future. These, I have frequently seen, were\nthe principal subjects on which the messengers should dwell.\nIf the chosen messengers of the Lord should wait for every obsta-\ncle to be moved out of their way, many never would go to search for\nthe scattered sheep. Satan will present many objections in order to\nkeep them from duty. But they will have to go out by faith, trusting\nin Him who has called them to His work, and He will open the way[64]\nbefore them, as far as it will be for their good and His glory. Jesus,\nthe great teacher and pattern, had not where to lay His head. His\nlife was one of toil, sorrow, and suffering; He then gave Himself for\nus. Those who, in Christ\u2019s stead, beseech souls to be reconciled to\nGod, and who hope to reign with Christ in glory, must expect to be\npartakers of His sufferings here. \u201cThey that sow in tears shall reap\nin joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall\ndoubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d\nPsalm 126:5, 6.\n* * * * *\nMark of the Beast\nIn a view given June 27, 1850, my accompanying angel said,\n\u201cTime is almost finished. Do you reflect the lovely image of Jesus\nas you should?\u201d Then I was pointed to the earth and saw that there\nwould have to be a getting ready among those who have of late\nembraced the third angel\u2019s message. Said the angel, \u201cGet ready, get\nready, get ready. Ye will have to die a greater death to the world than\nye have ever yet died.\u201d I saw that there was a great work to do for\nthem and but little time in which to do it.\nThen I saw that the seven last plagues were soon to be poured\nout upon those who have no shelter; yet the world regarded them no\nmore than they would so many drops of water that were about to fall.\nI was then made capable of enduring the awful sight of the seven last\nplagues, the wrath of God. I saw that His anger was dreadful and\nterrible, and if He should stretch forth His hand, or lift it in anger,\nthe inhabitants of the world would be as though they had never been,\nor would suffer from incurable sores and withering plagues that [65]\nwould come upon them, and they would find no deliverance, but be\ndestroyed by them. Terror seized me, and I fell upon my face before\nthe angel and begged of him to cause the sight to be removed, to hide\nit from me, for it was too dreadful. Then I realized, as never before,\nthe importance of searching the Word of God carefully, to know how\nto escape the plagues which that Word declares shall come on all\nthe ungodly who shall worship the beast and his image and receive\nhis mark in their foreheads or in their hands. It was a great wonder\nfor me that any could transgress the law of God and tread down His\nholy Sabbath, when such awful threatenings and denunciations were\nagainst them.\nThe pope has changed the day of rest from the seventh to the\nfirst day. He has thought to change the very commandment that\nwas given to cause man to remember his Creator. He has thought\nto change the greatest commandment in the Decalogue and thus\nmake himself equal with God, or even exalt himself above God.\n79\n80 Early Writings\nThe Lord is unchangeable, therefore His law is immutable; but\nthe pope has exalted himself above God, in seeking to change His\nimmutable precepts of holiness, justice, and goodness. He has\ntrampled underfoot God\u2019s sanctified day, and, on his own authority,\nput in its place one of the six laboring days. The whole nation has\nfollowed after the beast, and every week they rob God of His holy\ntime. The pope has made a breach in the holy law of God, but I saw\nthat the time had fully come for this breach to be made up by the\npeople of God and the waste places built up.\nI pleaded before the angel for God to save His people who had\ngone astray, to save them for His mercy\u2019s sake. When the plagues\nbegin to fall, those who continue to break the holy Sabbath will not\nopen their mouths to plead those excuses that they now make to get[66]\nrid of keeping it. Their mouths will be closed while the plagues are\nfalling, and the great Lawgiver is requiring justice of those who have\nhad His holy law in derision and have called it \u201ca curse to man,\u201d\n\u201cmiserable,\u201d and \u201crickety.\u201d When such feel the iron grasp of this law\ntaking hold of them, these expressions will appear before them in\nliving characters, and they will then realize the sin of having that\nlaw in derision which the Word of God calls \u201choly, just, and good.\u201d\nThen I was pointed to the glory of heaven, to the treasure laid\nup for the faithful. Everything was lovely and glorious. The angels\nwould sing a lovely song, then they would cease singing and take\ntheir crowns from their heads and cast them glittering at the feet of\nthe lovely Jesus, and with melodious voices cry, \u201cGlory, Alleluia!\u201d I\njoined with them in their songs of praise and honor to the Lamb, and\nevery time I opened my mouth to praise Him, I felt an unutterable\nsense of the glory that surrounded me. It was a far more, an exceed-\ning and eternal weight of glory. Said the angel, \u201cThe little remnant\nwho love God and keep His commandments and are faithful to the\nend will enjoy this glory and ever be in the presence of Jesus and\nsing with the holy angels.\u201d\nThen my eyes were taken from the glory, and I was pointed to\nthe remnant on the earth. The angel said to them, \u201cWill ye shun the\nseven last plagues? Will ye go to glory and enjoy all that God has\nprepared for those who love Him and are willing to suffer for His\nsake? If so, ye must die that ye may live. Get ready, get ready, get\nready. Ye must have a greater preparation than ye now have, for\nMark of the Beast 81\nthe day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger,\nto lay the land desolate and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.\nSacrifice all to God. Lay all upon His altar\u2014self, property, and all, a [67]\nliving sacrifice. It will take all to enter glory. Lay up for yourselves\ntreasure in heaven, where no thief can approach or rust corrupt. Ye\nmust be partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings here if ye would be partakers\nwith Him of His glory hereafter.\u201d\nHeaven will be cheap enough, if we obtain it through suffering.\nWe must deny self all along the way, die to self daily, let Jesus alone\nappear, and keep His glory continually in view. I saw that those who\nof late have embraced the truth would have to know what it is to\nsuffer for Christ\u2019s sake, that they would have trials to pass through\nthat would be keen and cutting, in order that they may be purified\nand fitted through suffering to receive the seal of the living God,\npass through the time of trouble, see the King in His beauty, and\ndwell in the presence of God and of pure, holy angels.\nAs I saw what we must be in order to inherit glory, and then saw\nhow much Jesus had suffered to obtain for us so rich an inheritance,\nI prayed that we might be baptized into Christ\u2019s sufferings, that\nwe might not shrink at trials, but bear them with patience and joy,\nknowing what Jesus had suffered that we through His poverty and\nsufferings might be made rich. Said the angel, \u201cDeny self; ye must\nstep fast.\u201d Some of us have had time to get the truth and to advance\nstep by step, and every step we have taken has given us strength to\ntake the next. But now time is almost finished, and what we have\nbeen years learning, they will have to learn in a few months. They\nwill also have much to unlearn and much to learn again. Those who\nwould not receive the mark of the beast and his image when the\ndecree goes forth, must have decision now to say, Nay, we will not\nregard the institution of the beast.\nThe Blind Leading the Blind[68]\nI have seen how the blind guides were laboring to make souls\nas blind as themselves, little realizing what is coming upon them.\nThey are exalting themselves against the truth, and as it triumphs,\nmany who have looked on these teachers as men of God and have\nlooked to them for light, are troubled. They inquire of these leaders\nrelative to the Sabbath, and they, with the object of getting rid of\nthe fourth commandment, will answer them thereto. I saw that real\nhonesty was not regarded in taking the many positions that were\ntaken against the Sabbath. The main object is to get around the\nSabbath of the Lord and observe another day than that sanctified\nand hallowed by Jehovah. If they are driven from one position, they\ntake an opposite one, even a position that they had but just before\ncondemned as unsound.\nGod\u2019s people are coming into the unity of the faith. Those\nwho observe the Sabbath of the Bible are united in their views of\nBible truth. But those who oppose the Sabbath among the Advent\npeople are disunited and strangely divided. One comes forward in\nopposition to the Sabbath and declares it to be thus and so, and at the\nconclusion calls it settled. But as his effort does not put the question\nto rest, and as the Sabbath cause progresses and the children of the\nLord still embrace it, another comes forward to overthrow it. But\nin presenting his views to get around the Sabbath, he entirely tears\ndown the arguments of him who made the first effort against the\ntruth, and presents a theory as opposite to his as to ours. So with the\nthird and the fourth; but none of them will have it as it stands in the[69]\nWord of God: \u201cThe seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.\u201d\nSuch, I saw, have the carnal mind, therefore are not subject to\nthe holy law of God. They are not agreed among themselves, yet\nlabor hard with their inferences to wrest the Scriptures to make a\nbreach in God\u2019s law, to change, abolish, or do anything with the\nfourth commandment rather than to observe it. They wish to silence\nthe flock upon this question; therefore they get up something with\n82\nBlind Leading the Blind 83\nthe hope that it will quiet them and that many of their followers will\nsearch their Bibles so little that their leaders can easily make error\nappear like truth, and they receive it as such, not looking higher than\ntheir leaders.\n* * * * *\nPreparation for the End\nAt Oswego, New York, September 7, 1850, the Lord showed\nme that a great work must be done for His people before they could\nstand in the battle in the day of the Lord. I was pointed to those who\nclaim to be Adventists, but who reject the present truth, and saw\nthat they were crumbling and that the hand of the Lord was in their\nmidst to divide and scatter them now in the gathering time, so that\nthe precious jewels among them, who have formerly been deceived,\nmay have their eyes opened to see their true state. And now when\nthe truth is presented to them by the Lord\u2019s messengers, they are\nprepared to listen, and see its beauty and harmony, and to leave their\nformer associates and errors, embrace the precious truth and stand\nwhere they can define their position.\nI saw that those who oppose the Sabbath of the Lord could not\ntake the Bible and show that our position is incorrect; therefore they\nwould slander those who believe and teach the truth and would attack[70]\ntheir characters. Many who were once conscientious and loved God\nand His Word have become so hardened by rejecting the light of truth\nthat they do not hesitate to wickedly misrepresent and falsely accuse\nthose who love the holy Sabbath, if by so doing they can injure the\ninfluence of those who fearlessly declare the truth. But these things\nwill not hinder the work of God. In fact, this course pursued by\nthose who hate the truth will be the very means of opening the eyes\nof some. Every jewel will be brought out and gathered, for the hand\nof the Lord is set to recover the remnant of His people, and He will\naccomplish the work gloriously.\nWe who believe the truth should be very careful to give no\noccasion for our good to be evil spoken of. We should know that\nevery step we take is in accordance with the Bible; for those who\nhate the commandments of God will triumph over our missteps and\nfaults, as the wicked did in 1843.\nMay 14, 1851, I saw the beauty and loveliness of Jesus. As I\nbeheld His glory, the thought did not occur to me that I should ever\n84\nPreparation for the End 85\nbe separated from His presence. I saw a light coming from the glory\nthat encircled the Father, and as it approached near to me, my body\ntrembled and shook like a leaf. I thought that if it should come near\nme I would be struck out of existence, but the light passed me. Then\ncould I have some sense of the great and terrible God with whom we\nhave to do. I saw then what faint views some have of the holiness of\nGod, and how much they take His holy and reverend name in vain,\nwithout realizing that it is God, the great and terrible God, of whom\nthey are speaking. While praying, many use careless and irreverent\nexpressions, which grieve the tender Spirit of the Lord and cause\ntheir petitions to be shut out of heaven.\nI also saw that many do not realize what they must be in order [71]\nto live in the sight of the Lord without a high priest in the sanctuary\nthrough the time of trouble. Those who receive the seal of the living\nGod and are protected in the time of trouble must reflect the image\nof Jesus fully.\nI saw that many were neglecting the preparation so needful and\nwere looking to the time of \u201crefreshing\u201d and the \u201clatter rain\u201d to fit\nthem to stand in the day of the Lord and to live in His sight. Oh,\nhow many I saw in the time of trouble without a shelter! They had\nneglected the needful preparation; therefore they could not receive\nthe refreshing that all must have to fit them to live in the sight of\na holy God. Those who refuse to be hewed by the prophets and\nfail to purify their souls in obeying the whole truth, and who are\nwilling to believe that their condition is far better than it really is,\nwill come up to the time of the falling of the plagues, and then see\nthat they needed to be hewed and squared for the building. But there\nwill be no time then to do it and no Mediator to plead their cause\nbefore the Father. Before this time the awfully solemn declaration\nhas gone forth, \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he\nwhich is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let\nhim be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\u201d I\nsaw that none could share the \u201crefreshing\u201d unless they obtain the\nvictory over every besetment, over pride, selfishness, love of the\nworld, and over every wrong word and action. We should, therefore,\nbe drawing nearer and nearer to the Lord and be earnestly seeking\nthat preparation necessary to enable us to stand in the battle in the\n86 Early Writings\nday of the Lord. Let all remember that God is holy and that none\nbut holy beings can ever dwell in His presence.\nPrayer and Faith [72]\nI have frequently seen that the children of the Lord neglect\nprayer, especially secret prayer, altogether too much; that many do\nnot exercise that faith which it is their privilege and duty to exercise,\noften waiting for that feeling which faith alone can bring. Feeling\nis not faith; the two are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise, but joyful\nfeeling and the blessing are God\u2019s to give. The grace of God comes\nto the soul through the channel of living faith, and that faith it is in\nour power to exercise.\nTrue faith lays hold of and claims the promised blessing before\nit is realized and felt. We must send up our petitions in faith within\nthe second veil and let our faith take hold of the promised blessing\nand claim it as ours. We are then to believe that we receive the\nblessing, because our faith has hold of it, and according to the Word\nit is ours. \u201cWhat things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe\nthat ye receive them, and ye shall have them.\u201d Mark 11:24. Here\nis faith, naked faith, to believe that we receive the blessing, even\nbefore we realize it. When the promised blessing is realized and\nenjoyed, faith is swallowed up. But many suppose they have much\nfaith when sharing largely of the Holy Spirit and that they cannot\nhave faith unless they feel the power of the Spirit. Such confound\nfaith with the blessing that comes through faith. The very time to\nexercise faith is when we feel destitute of the Spirit. When thick\nclouds of darkness seem to hover over the mind, then is the time to\nlet living faith pierce the darkness and scatter the clouds. True faith\nrests on the promises contained in the Word of God, and those only\nwho obey that Word can claim its glorious promises. \u201cIf ye abide [73]\nin Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it\nshall be done unto you.\u201d John 15:7. \u201cWhatsoever we ask, we receive\nof Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things\nthat are pleasing in His sight.\u201d 1 John 3:22.\nWe should be much in secret prayer. Christ is the vine, ye are the\nbranches. And if we would grow and flourish, we must continually\n87\n88 Early Writings\ndraw sap and nourishment from the Living Vine; for separated from\nthe Vine we have no strength.\nI asked the angel why there was no more faith and power in\nIsrael. He said, \u201cYe let go of the arm of the Lord too soon. Press your\npetitions to the throne, and hold on by strong faith. The promises\nare sure. Believe ye receive the things ye ask for, and ye shall have\nthem.\u201d I was then pointed to Elijah. He was subject to like passions\nas we are, and he prayed earnestly. His faith endured the trial. Seven\ntimes he prayed before the Lord, and at last the cloud was seen. I saw\nthat we had doubted the sure promises, and wounded the Saviour by\nour lack of faith. Said the angel, \u201cGird the armor about thee, and\nabove all take the shield of faith; for that will guard the heart, the very\nlife, from the fiery darts of the wicked.\u201d If the enemy can lead the\ndesponding to take their eyes off from Jesus, and look to themselves,\nand dwell upon their own unworthiness, instead of dwelling upon\nthe worthiness of Jesus, His love, His merits, and His great mercy,\nhe will get away their shield of faith and gain his object; they will\nbe exposed to his fiery temptations. The weak should therefore look\nto Jesus, and believe in Him; they then exercise faith.\nThe Gathering Time [74]\nSeptember 23, the Lord showed me that He had stretched out His\nhand the second time to recover the remnant of His people, [see page\n86.] and that efforts must be redoubled in this gathering time. In the\nscattering, Israel was smitten and torn, but now in the gathering time\nGod will heal and bind up His people. In the scattering, efforts made\nto spread the truth had but little effect, accomplished but little or\nnothing; but in the gathering, when God has set His hand to gather\nHis people, efforts to spread the truth will have their designed effect.\nAll should be united and zealous in the work. I saw that it was wrong\nfor any to refer to the scattering for examples to govern us now in the\ngathering; for if God should do no more for us now than He did then,\nIsrael would never be gathered. I have seen that the 1843 chart was\ndirected by the hand of the Lord, and that it should not be altered;\nthat the figures were as He wanted them; that His hand was over and\nhid a mistake in some of the figures, so that none could see it, until\nHis hand was removed. [This applies to the chart used during the\n1843 movement, and has special reference to the calculation of the\nprophetic periods as it appeared on that chart. The next sentence\nexplains that there was an inaccuracy which in the providence of\nGod was suffered to exist. But this does not preclude the publication\nof a chart subsequently which would correct the mistake, after the\n1843 movement was past, and the calculation as then made had\nserved its purpose.]\nThen I saw in relation to the \u201cdaily\u201d (Daniel 8:12) that the word\n\u201csacrifice\u201d was supplied by man\u2019s wisdom, and does not belong\nto the text, and that the Lord gave the correct view of it to those\nwho gave the judgment hour cry. When union existed, before 1844, [75]\nnearly all were united on the correct view of the \u201cdaily\u201d; but in\nthe confusion since 1844, other views have been embraced, and\ndarkness and confusion have followed. Time has not been a test\nsince 1844, and it will never again be a test.\n89\n90 Early Writings\nThe Lord has shown me that the message of the third angel\nmust go, and be proclaimed to the scattered children of the Lord,\nbut it must not be hung on time. I saw that some were getting a\nfalse excitement, arising from preaching time; but the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is stronger than time can be. I saw that this message can\nstand on its own foundation and needs not time to strengthen it; and\nthat it will go in mighty power, and do its work, and will be cut short\nin righteousness.\nThen I was pointed to some who are in the great error of believing\nthat it is their duty to go to Old Jerusalem, [see Appendix.] and think\nthey have a work to do there before the Lord comes. Such a view\nis calculated to take the mind and interest from the present work\nof the Lord, under the message of the third angel; for those who\nthink that they are yet to go to Jerusalem will have their minds there,\nand their means will be withheld from the cause of present truth to\nget themselves and others there. I saw that such a mission would\naccomplish no real good, that it would take a long while to make a\nvery few of the Jews believe even in the first advent of Christ, much\nmore to believe in His second advent. I saw that Satan had greatly\ndeceived some in this thing and that souls all around them in this\nland could be helped by them and led to keep the commandments\nof God, but they were leaving them to perish. I also saw that Old\nJerusalem never would be built up; and that Satan was doing his\nutmost to lead the minds of the children of the Lord into these things\nnow, in the gathering time, to keep them from throwing their whole[76]\ninterest into the present work of the Lord, and to cause them to\nneglect the necessary preparation for the day of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nDear Reader,\nA sense of duty to my brethren and sisters and a desire that the\nblood of souls might not be found on my garments have governed\nme in writing this little work. I am aware of the unbelief that exists\nin the minds of the multitude relative to visions, also that many\nwho profess to be looking for Christ and teach that we are in the\n\u201clast days\u201d call them all of Satan. I expect much opposition from\nsuch, and had I not felt that the Lord required it of me, I should not\nGathering Time 91\nhave made my views thus public, as they will probably call forth the\nhatred and derision of some. But I fear God more than man.\nWhen the Lord first gave me messages to deliver to His people,\nit was hard for me to declare them, and I often softened them down\nand made them as mild as possible for fear of grieving some. It was\na great trial to declare the messages as the Lord gave them to me. I\ndid not realize that I was so unfaithful and did not see the sin and\ndanger of such a course until in vision I was taken into the presence\nof Jesus. He looked upon me with a frown and turned His face from\nme. It is not possible to describe the terror and agony I then felt. I\nfell upon my face before Him, but had no power to utter a word. Oh,\nhow I longed to be covered and hid from that dreadful frown! Then\ncould I realize, in some degree, what the feeling of the lost will be\nwhen they cry, \u201cMountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from\nthe face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the\nLamb.\u201d\nPresently an angel bade me rise, and the sight that met my eyes\ncan hardly be described. A company was presented before me [77]\nwhose hair and garments were torn and whose countenances were\nthe very picture of despair and horror. They came close to me and\ntook their garments and rubbed them on mine. I looked upon my\ngarments and saw that they were stained with blood, and that blood\nwas eating holes in them. Again I fell like one dead at the feet of\nmy accompanying angel. I could not plead one excuse. My tongue\nrefused all utterance, and I longed to be away from such a holy place.\nAgain the angel stood me upon my feet and said, \u201cThis is not your\ncase now, but this scene has passed before you to let you know what\nyour situation must be if you neglect to declare to others what the\nLord has revealed to you. But if you are faithful to the end, you shall\neat of the tree of life and shall drink of the river of the water of life.\nYou will have to suffer much, but the grace of God is sufficient.\u201d I\nthen felt willing to do all that the Lord might require me to do that I\nmight have His approbation and not feel His dreadful frown.\nI have frequently been falsely charged with teaching views pe-\nculiar to Spiritualism. But before the editor of the Day-Star [see\nAppendix.] ran into that delusion, the Lord gave me a view of the\nsad and desolating effects that would be produced upon the flock by\nhim and others in teaching the spiritual views. I have often seen the\n92 Early Writings\nlovely Jesus, that He is a person. I asked Him if His Father was a\nperson and had a form like Himself. Said Jesus, \u201cI am in the express\nimage of My Father\u2019s person.\u201d\nI have often seen that the spiritual view took away all the glory of\nheaven, and that in many minds the throne of David and the lovely\nperson of Jesus have been burned up in the fire of Spiritualism.\nI have seen that some who have been deceived and led into this\nerror will be brought out into the light of truth, but it will be almost\nimpossible for them to get entirely rid of the deceptive power of[78]\nSpiritualism. Such should make thorough work in confessing their\nerrors and leaving them forever.\nI recommend to you, dear reader, the Word of God as the rule of\nyour faith and practice. By that Word we are to be judged. God has,\nin that Word, promised to give visions in the \u201clast days\u201d; not for a\nnew rule of faith, but for the comfort of His people, and to correct\nthose who err from Bible truth. Thus God dealt with Peter when He\nwas about to send him to preach to the Gentiles. (Acts 10.).\nTo those who may circulate this little work, I would say that it is\ndesigned for the sincere only and not for those who would ridicule\nthe things of the Spirit of God.\n* * * * *\nMrs. White\u2019s Dreams\n[Referred to on Page 12]\nI dreamed of seeing a temple to which many people were flock-\ning. Only those who took refuge in that temple would be saved when\ntime should close. All who remained outside would be forever lost.\nThe multitudes without, who were going their various ways, were\nderiding and ridiculing those who were entering the temple, and told\nthem that this plan of safety was a cunning deception, that, in fact,\nthere was no danger whatever to avoid. They even laid hold of some\nto prevent them from hastening within the walls.\nFearing to be laughed at and ridiculed, I thought best to wait\nuntil the multitude were dispersed, or until I could enter unobserved\nby them. But the numbers increased instead of diminishing, and\nfearful of being too late, I hastily left my home and pressed through\nthe crowd. In my anxiety to reach the temple I did not notice or [79]\ncare for the throng that surrounded me. On entering the building, I\nsaw that the vast temple was supported by one immense pillar, and\nto this was tied a Lamb all mangled and bleeding. We who were\npresent seemed to know that this Lamb had been torn and bruised\non our account. All who entered the temple must come before it and\nconfess their sins.\nJust before the Lamb were elevated seats upon which sat a com-\npany of people looking very happy. The light of heaven seemed\nto shine upon their faces, and they praised God and sang songs of\nglad thanksgiving that seemed to be like the music of angels. These\nwere they who had come before the Lamb, confessed their sins, been\npardoned, and were now waiting in glad expectation of some joyful\nevent.\nEven after having entered the building a fear came over me\nand a sense of shame that I must humiliate myself before these\npeople. But I seemed compelled to move forward, and was slowly\nmaking my way around the pillar in order to face the Lamb, when a\n93\n94 Early Writings\ntrumpet sounded, the temple shook, shouts of triumph arose from\nthe assembled saints, an awful brightness illuminated the building,\nthen all was intense darkness. The happy people had all disappeared\nwith the brightness, and I was left alone in the silent horror of night.\nI awoke in agony of mind and could hardly convince myself that\nI had been dreaming. It seemed to me that my doom was fixed, that\nthe Spirit of the Lord had left me, never to return. My despondency\ndeepened, if that were possible.\nSoon after this I had another dream. I seemed to be sitting in\nabject despair, with my face in my hands, reflecting like this: If\nJesus were upon earth, I would go to Him, throw myself at His feet,\nand tell Him all my sufferings. He would not turn away from me,[80]\nHe would have mercy upon me, and I should love and serve Him\nalways. Just then the door opened, and a person of beautiful form\nand countenance entered. He looked upon me pityingly and said:\n\u201cDo you wish to see Jesus? He is here and you can see Him if you\ndesire to do so. Take everything you possess and follow me.\u201d\nI heard this with unspeakable joy, and gladly gathered up all my\nlittle possessions, every treasured trinket, and followed my guide.\nHe led me to a steep and apparently frail stairway. As I commenced\nto ascend the steps, he cautioned me to keep my eyes fixed upward,\nlest I should grow dizzy and fall. Many others who were climbing\nup the steep ascent fell before gaining the top.\nFinally we reached the last step and stood before the door. Here\nmy guide directed me to leave all the things that I had brought with\nme. I cheerfully laid them down; he then opened the door and bade\nme enter. In a moment I stood before Jesus. There was no mistaking\nthat beautiful countenance. Such a radiant expression of benevolence\nand majesty could belong to no other. As His gaze rested upon me,\nI knew at once that He was acquainted with every circumstance of\nmy life and all my inner thoughts and feelings.\nI tried to shield myself from His gaze, feeling unable to endure\nHis searching eyes, but He drew near with a smile, and, laying His\nhand upon my head, said: \u201cFear not.\u201d The sound of His sweet voice\nthrilled my heart with a happiness it had never before experienced.\nI was too joyful to utter a word, but, overcome with ineffable hap-\npiness, sank prostrate at His feet. While I was lying helpless there,\nscenes of beauty and glory passed before me, and I seemed to have\nMrs. White\u2019s Dreams 95\nreached the safety and peace of heaven. At length my strength re- [81]\nturned, and I arose. The loving eyes of Jesus were still upon me, and\nHis smile filled my soul with gladness. His presence filled me with\nholy reverence and an inexpressible love.\nMy guide now opened the door, and we both passed out. He\nbade me take up again all the things I had left without. This done,\nhe handed me a green cord coiled up closely. This he directed me\nto place next my heart, and when I wished to see Jesus, take from\nmy bosom and stretch it to the utmost. He cautioned me not to\nlet it remain coiled for any length of time, lest it should become\nknotted and difficult to straighten. I placed the cord near my heart\nand joyfully descended the narrow stairs, praising the Lord and\njoyfully telling all whom I met where they could find Jesus. This\ndream gave me hope. The green cord represented faith to my mind,\nand the beauty and simplicity of trusting in God began to dawn upon\nmy benighted soul.\n* * * * *\nWilliam Miller\u2019s Dream\n[Referred to on Page 48]\nI dreamed that God, by an unseen hand, sent me a curiously\nwrought casket about ten inches long by six square, made of ebony\nand pearls curiously inlaid. To the casket there was a key attached.\nI immediately took the key and opened the casket, when, to my\nwonder and surprise, I found it filled with all sorts and sizes of\njewels, diamonds, precious stones, and gold and silver coin of every\ndimension and value, beautifully arranged in their several places in\nthe casket; and thus arranged they reflected a light and glory equaled\nonly to the sun.\nI thought it was not my duty to enjoy this wonderful sight alone,\nalthough my heart was overjoyed at the brilliancy, beauty, and value[82]\nof its contents. I therefore placed it on a center table in my room\nand gave out word that all who had a desire might come and see the\nmost glorious and brilliant sight ever seen by man in this life.\nThe people began to come in, at first few in number, but in-\ncreasing to a crowd. When they first looked into the casket, they\nwould wonder and shout for joy. But when the spectators increased,\neveryone would begin to trouble the jewels, taking them out of the\ncasket and scattering them on the table.\nI began to think that the owner would require the casket and the\njewels again at my hand; and if I suffered them to be scattered, I\ncould never place them in their places in the casket again as before;\nand felt I should never be able to meet the accountability, for it would\nbe immense. I then began to plead with the people not to handle\nthem, nor to take them out of the casket; but the more I pleaded, the\nmore they scattered; and now they seemed to scatter them all over\nthe room, on the floor and on every piece of furniture in the room.\nI then saw that among the genuine jewels and coin they had\nscattered an innumerable quantity of spurious jewels and counterfeit\ncoin. I was highly incensed at their base conduct and ingratitude,\n96\nWilliam Miller\u2019s Dream 97\nand reproved and reproached them for it; but the more I reproved,\nthe more they scattered the spurious jewels and false coin among\nthe genuine.\nI then became vexed in my physical soul and began to use phys-\nical force to push them out of the room; but while I was pushing\nout one, three more would enter and bring in dirt and shavings and\nsand and all manner of rubbish, until they covered every one of the\ntrue jewels, diamonds, and coins, which were all excluded from\nsight. They also tore in pieces my casket and scattered it among [83]\nthe rubbish. I thought no man regarded my sorrow or my anger.\nI became wholly discouraged and disheartened, and sat down and\nwept.\nWhile I was thus weeping and mourning for my great loss and\naccountability, I remembered God, and earnestly prayed that He\nwould send me help.\nImmediately the door opened, and a man entered the room, when\nthe people all left it; and he, having a dirt brush in his hand, opened\nthe windows, and began to brush the dirt and rubbish from the room.\nI cried to him to forbear, for there were some precious jewels\nscattered among the rubbish.\nHe told me to \u201cfear not,\u201d for he would \u201ctake care of them.\u201d\nThen, while he brushed the dirt and rubbish, false jewels and\ncounterfeit coin, all rose and went out of the window like a cloud,\nand the wind carried them away. In the bustle I closed my eyes\nfor a moment; when I opened them, the rubbish was all gone. The\nprecious jewels, the diamonds, the gold and silver coins, lay scattered\nin profusion all over the room.\nHe then placed on the table a casket, much larger and more\nbeautiful than the former, and gathered up the jewels, the diamonds,\nthe coins, by the handful, and cast them into the casket, till not one\nwas left, although some of the diamonds were not bigger than the\npoint of a pin.\nHe then called upon me to \u201ccome and see.\u201d\nI looked into the casket, but my eyes were dazzled with the sight.\nThey shone with ten times their former glory. I thought they had\nbeen scoured in the sand by the feet of those wicked persons who had\nscattered and trod them in the dust. They were arranged in beautiful\norder in the casket, every one in its place, without any visible pains\n98 Early Writings\nof the man who cast them in. I shouted with very joy, and that shout\nawoke me.\nSupplement [84]\n[85]\nAn Explanation\nDear Christian Friends,\nAs I have given a brief sketch of my experience and views,\npublished in 1851, it seems to be my duty to notice some points in\nthat little work, also to give more recent views.\n1. On page 33 is given the following: \u201cI saw that the holy\nSabbath is, and will be, the separating wall between the true Israel\nof God and unbelievers; and that the Sabbath is the great question\nto unite the hearts of God\u2019s dear, waiting saints. I saw that God\nhad children who do not see and keep the Sabbath. They have not\nrejected the light upon it. And at the commencement of the time of\ntrouble, we were filled with the Holy Ghost as we went forth and\nproclaimed the Sabbath more fully.\u201d\nThis view was given in 1847 when there were but very few of\nthe Advent brethren observing the Sabbath, and of these but few\nsupposed that its observance was of sufficient importance to draw a\nline between the people of God and unbelievers. Now the fulfillment\nof that view is beginning to be seen. \u201cThe commencement of that\ntime of trouble,\u201d here mentioned does not refer to the time when the\nplagues shall begin to be poured out, but to a short period just before\nthey are poured out, while Christ is in the sanctuary. At that time,\nwhile the work of salvation is closing, trouble will be coming on the\nearth, and the nations will be angry, yet held in check so as not to\nprevent the work of the third angel. At that time the \u201clatter rain,\u201d or[86]\nrefreshing from the presence of the Lord, will come, to give power\nto the loud voice of the third angel, and prepare the saints to stand\nin the period when the seven last plagues shall be poured out.\n2. The view of \u201cThe Open and Shut Door\u201d, on pages 42-45,\nwas given in 1849. The application of Revelation 3:7, 8, to the\nheavenly sanctuary and Christ\u2019s ministry was entirely new to me. I\nhad never heard the idea advanced by anyone. Now as the subject of\nthe sanctuary is being clearly understood, the application is seen in\nits force and beauty.\n100\nExplanation 101\n3. The view that the Lord \u201chad stretched out His hand the second\ntime to recover the remnant of His people,\u201d on page 74, refers only\nto the union and strength once existing among those looking for\nChrist, and to the fact that He had begun to unite and to raise up His\npeople again.\n4. Spirit Manifestations. [see Appendix.] On page 43 read as\nfollows: \u201cI saw that the mysterious knocking in New York and\nother places was the power of Satan, and that such things would be\nmore and more common, clothed in a religious garb so as to lull the\ndeceived to greater security and to draw the minds of God\u2019s people,\nif possible, to those things and cause them to doubt the teaching and\npower of the Holy Ghost.\u201d This view was given in 1849, nearly five\nyears since. Then spirit manifestations were mostly confined to the\ncity of Rochester, known as the \u201cRochester knockings.\u201d Since that\ntime the heresy has spread beyond the expectations of anyone.\nMuch of the view on page 59, headed \u201cMysterious Rapping\u201d\ngiven August 1850, has since been fulfilled, and is now fulfilling.\nHere is a portion of it: \u201cI saw that soon it would be considered\nblasphemy to speak against the rapping, and that it would spread\nmore and more, that Satan\u2019s power would increase, and some of his [87]\ndevoted followers would have power to work miracles, and even to\nbring down fire from heaven in the sight of men. I was shown that\nby the rapping and mesmerism these modern magicians would yet\naccount for all the miracles wrought by our Lord Jesus Christ, and\nthat many would believe that all the mighty works of the Son of God\nwhen on earth were accomplished by this same power.\u201d\nI saw the rapping delusion\u2014what progress it was making, and\nthat if it were possible it would deceive the very elect. Satan will\nhave power to bring before us the appearance of forms purporting to\nbe our relatives or friends now sleeping in Jesus. It will be made to\nappear as if these friends were present; the words that they uttered\nwhile here, with which we were familiar, will be spoken, and the\nsame tone of voice that they had while living will fall upon the ear.\nAll this is to deceive the saints and ensnare them into the belief of\nthis delusion.\nI saw that the saints must get a thorough understanding of present\ntruth, which they will be obliged to maintain from the Scriptures.\nThey must understand the state of the dead; for the spirits of devils\n102 Early Writings\nwill yet appear to them, professing to be beloved friends and rela-\ntives, who will declare to them that the Sabbath has been changed,\nalso other unscriptural doctrines. They will do all in their power\nto excite sympathy and will work miracles before them to confirm\nwhat they declare. The people of God must be prepared to withstand\nthese spirits with the Bible truth that the dead know not anything,\nand that they who appear to them are the spirits of devils. Our minds\nmust not be taken up with things around us, but must be occupied\nwith the present truth and a preparation to give a reason of our hope\nwith meekness and fear. We must seek wisdom from on high that[88]\nwe may stand in this day of error and delusion.\nWe must examine well the foundation of our hope, for we shall\nhave to give a reason for it from the Scriptures. This delusion will\nspread, and we shall have to contend with it face to face; and unless\nwe are prepared for it, we shall be ensnared and overcome. But if\nwe do what we can on our part to be ready for the conflict that is\njust before us, God will do His part, and His all-powerful arm will\nprotect us. He would sooner send every angel out of glory to the\nrelief of faithful souls, to make a hedge about them, than have them\ndeceived and led away by the lying wonders of Satan.\nI saw the rapidity with which this delusion was spreading. A\ntrain of cars was shown me, going with the speed of lightning. The\nangel bade me look carefully. I fixed my eyes upon the train. It\nseemed that the whole world was on board, that there could not be\none left. Said the angel, \u201cThey are binding in bundles ready to burn.\u201d\nThen he showed me the conductor, who appeared like a stately, fair\nperson, whom all the passengers looked up to and reverenced. I was\nperplexed and asked my attending angel who it was. He said, \u201cIt is\nSatan. He is the conductor in the form of an angel of light. He has\ntaken the world captive. They are given over to strong delusions, to\nbelieve a lie, that they may be damned. This agent, the next highest\nin order to him, is the engineer, and other of his agents are employed\nin different offices as he may need them, and they are all going with\nlightning speed to perdition.\u201d\nI asked the angel if there were none left. He bade me look in\nan opposite direction, and I saw a little company traveling a narrow\npathway. All seemed to be firmly united, bound together by the\ntruth, in bundles, or companies. Said the angel, \u201cThe third angel is[89]\nExplanation 103\nbinding, or sealing, them in bundles for the heavenly garner.\u201d This\nlittle company looked careworn, as if they had passed through severe\ntrials and conflicts. And it appeared as if the sun had just risen from\nbehind a cloud and shone upon their countenances, causing them to\nlook triumphant, as if their victories were nearly won.\nI saw that the Lord has given the world opportunity to discover\nthe snare. This one thing is evidence enough for the Christian,\nif there were no other; namely, that there is no difference made\nbetween the precious and the vile. Thomas Paine, whose body has\nnow moldered to dust and who is to be called forth at the end of\nthe one thousand years, at the second resurrection, to receive his\nreward and suffer the second death, is represented by Satan as being\nin heaven, and highly exalted there. Satan used him on earth as\nlong as he could, and now he is carrying on the same work through\npretensions of having Thomas Paine so much exalted and honored\nin heaven; as he taught here, Satan would make it appear that he is\nteaching in heaven. There are some who have looked with horror at\nhis life and death, and his corrupt teachings while living, but who\nnow submit to be taught by him, one of the vilest and most corrupt\nof men, one who despised God and His law. [To appreciate the force\nof these remarks the reader needs to understand that a work was\npublished through the mediumship of \u201cRev. C. Hammond,\u201d entitled\nPilgrimage of Thomas Paine in the Spirit World, In which Paine is\nrepresented as an exalted spirit in the Seventh Sphere. And in the\n\u201cInvestigating Class in New York,\u201d it was said that Christ himself\nhad conversed with a medium and revealed that he was in the Sixth\nSphere. The disparity will be understood when it is remembered that\nthey represent the spirits as progressing in the spirit world, and that\nChrist, after more than 1800 years of progress, has reached the sixth\nsphere, while Paine, in about 100 years, has reached the seventh! A\nfurther explanation of this may be found in the statement of Doctor\nHare, that his spirit sister said her progress had been retarded by\nher belief in the atonement of Christ. Thus does spiritualism exalt\ninfidels and infidelity. See also appendix.]\nHe who is the father of lies, blinds and deceives the world by [90]\nsending forth his angels to speak for the apostles, and to make it\nappear that they contradict what they wrote by the dictation of the\nHoly Ghost when on earth. These lying angels make the apostles to\n104 Early Writings\ncorrupt their own teachings and to declare them to be adulterated.\nBy so doing Satan delights to throw professed Christians and all the\nworld into uncertainty about the Word of God. That holy Book cuts\ndirectly across his track and thwarts his plans; therefore he leads\nthem to doubt its divine origin. Then he sets up the infidel, Thomas\nPaine, as if he were ushered into heaven when he died, and now,\nunited with the holy apostles whom he hated on earth, were engaged\nin teaching the world.\nSatan assigns to each of his angels a part to act. He enjoins upon\nthem all to be sly, artful, cunning. He instructs some of them to act\nthe part of the apostles and to speak for them, while others are to act\nthe part of infidels and wicked men who died cursing God, but now\nappear to be very religious. There is no difference made between the\nmost holy apostles and the vilest infidel. They are both made to teach\nthe same thing. It matters not whom Satan makes to speak, if his\nobject is only accomplished. He was so intimately connected with\nPaine upon the earth, aiding him in his work, that it is an easy thing\nfor him to know the very words Paine used and the very handwriting\nof one who served him so faithfully and accomplished his purposes\nso well. Satan dictated much of his writings, and it is an easy thing\nfor him to dictate sentiments through his angels now and make it\nappear that they come through Thomas Paine, who, while living,[91]\nwas a devoted servant of the evil one. This is the masterpiece of\nSatan. All this teaching, purporting to be from apostles and saints\nand wicked men who have died, comes directly from his satanic\nmajesty.\nThe fact that Satan claims that one whom he loved so well, and\nwho hated God so perfectly, is now with the holy apostles and angels\nin glory, should be enough to remove the veil from all minds and\ndiscover to them the dark, mysterious works of Satan. He virtually\nsays to the world and to infidels, No matter how wicked you are, no\nmatter whether you believe or disbelieve in God or the Bible, live\nas you please, heaven is your home; for all know that if Thomas\nPaine is in heaven, and so exalted, they will surely get there. This\nerror is so glaring that all may see if they will. Satan is now doing\nthrough persons like Thomas Paine what he has been trying to do\nsince his fall. He is, through his power and lying wonders, tearing\naway the foundation of the Christian\u2019s hope and putting out the sun\nExplanation 105\nthat is to light them in the narrow way to heaven. He is making the\nworld believe that the Bible is uninspired, no better than a storybook,\nwhile he holds out something to take its place; namely, spiritual\nmanifestations!\nHere is a channel wholly devoted to himself and under his con-\ntrol, and he can make the world believe what he will. The Book\nthat is to judge him and his followers he puts back in the shade,\njust where he wants it. The Saviour of the world he makes to be no\nmore than a common man; and as the Roman guard that watched the\ntomb of Jesus spread the lying report that the chief priests and elders\nput into their mouths, so will the poor, deluded followers of these\npretended spiritual manifestations repeat and try to make it appear [92]\nthat there is nothing miraculous about our Saviour\u2019s birth, death, and\nresurrection. After putting Jesus in the background, they attract the\nattention of the world to themselves and to their miracles and lying\nwonders, which, they declare, far exceed the works of Christ. Thus\nthe world is taken in the snare and lulled into a feeling of security,\nnot to find out their awful deception until the seven last plagues are\npoured out. Satan laughs as he sees his plan succeed so well and the\nwhole world taken in the snare.\n5. On page 55, I stated that a cloud of glorious light covered the\nFather and that His person could not be seen. I also stated that I saw\nthe Father rise from the throne. The Father was enshrouded with a\nbody of light and glory, so that His person could not be seen; yet I\nknew that it was the Father and that from His person emanated this\nlight and glory. When I saw this body of light and glory rise from\nthe throne, I knew it was because the Father moved, therefore said,\nI saw the Father rise. The glory, or excellency, of His form I never\nsaw; no one could behold it and live; yet the body of light and glory\nthat enshrouded His person could be seen.\nI also stated that \u201cSatan appeared to be by the throne, trying to\ncarry on the work of God.\u201d I will give another sentence from the\nsame page: \u201cI turned to look at the company who were still bowed\nbefore the throne.\u201d Now this praying company was in this mortal\nstate, on the earth, yet represented to me as bowed before the throne.\nI never had the idea that these individuals were actually in the New\nJerusalem. Neither did I ever think that any mortal could suppose\nthat I believed that Satan was actually in the New Jerusalem. But\n106 Early Writings\ndid not John see the great red dragon in heaven? Certainly. \u201cAnd\nthere appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red\ndragon, having seven heads and ten horns.\u201d Revelation 12:3. What[93]\na monster to be in heaven! Here seems to be as good a chance for\nridicule as in the interpretation which some have placed upon my\nstatements.\n6. On pages 48-52 is a view given January, 1850. That portion\nof this view which relates to means being withheld from the mes-\nsengers, applied more particularly to that time. Since then, friends\nof the cause of present truth have been raised up, who have watched\nfor opportunity to do good with their means. Some have handed out\ntoo freely, to the injury of the receivers. For about two years I have\nbeen shown more relative to a careless and too free use of the Lord\u2019s\nmoney, than a lack of it.\nThe following is from a view given at Jackson, Michigan, June\n2, 1853. It related mostly to the brethren at that place: \u201cI saw that\nthe brethren commenced to sacrifice their property and handed it\nout without having the true object set before them\u2014the suffering\ncause\u2014and they handed out too freely, too much, and too often. I\nsaw that the teachers should have stood in a place to correct this\nerror and exert a good influence in the church. Money has been\nmade of little or no consequence, the sooner disposed of the better.\nA bad example has been set by some in accepting large donations\nand not giving the least caution to those who had means not to use\nit too freely and carelessly. By accepting so large an amount of\nmeans, without questioning whether God had made it the duty of\nthe brethren to bestow so largely, too bountiful giving has been\nsanctioned.\n\u201cThose who gave also erred, not being particular to inquire into\nthe necessities of the case, whether there was actual need or not.\nThose who had means were thrown into great perplexity. One brother\nwas much hurt by too much means being put into his hands. He did[94]\nnot study economy, but lived extravagantly, and in his travels laid out\nmoney here and there to no profit. He spread a wrong influence by\nmaking such free use of the Lord\u2019s money, and would say in his own\nheart, and to others, \u2018There is means enough in J\u2014, more than can\nbe used before the Lord comes.\u2019 Some were very much injured by\nsuch a course and came into the truth with wrong views, not realizing\nExplanation 107\nthat it was the Lord\u2019s money they were using and not feeling the\nworth of it. Those poor souls who have just embraced the third\nangel\u2019s message and have had such an example set before them will\nhave much to learn to deny self and suffer for Christ\u2019s sake. They\nwill have to learn to give up ease, cease studying their convenience\nand comfort, and bear in mind the worth of souls. Those who feel\nthe \u2018woe\u2019 upon them will not be for making great preparations to\ntravel in ease and comfort. Some who have no calling have been\nencouraged into the field. Others have been affected by these things\nand have not felt the need of economy, of denying themselves, and\nputting into the treasury of the Lord. They would feel and say,\n\u2018There are others who have means enough; they will give for the\npaper. I need not do anything. The paper will be supported without\nmy help.\u2019\u201d\nIt has been no small trial to me to see that some have taken that\nportion of my views which related to sacrificing property to sustain\nthe cause and made a wrong use of it; they use means extravagantly,\nwhile neglecting to carry out the principles of other portions. On\npage 50, read the following: \u201cI saw that the cause of God had been\nhindered and dishonored by some traveling who had no message\nfrom God. Such will have to give an account to God for every dollar\nthey have used in traveling where it was not their duty to go, because\nthat money might have helped on the cause of God.\u201d Also, page [95]\n50: \u201cI saw that those who have strength to labor with their hands,\nand help sustain the cause, were as accountable for their strength as\nothers were for their property.\u201d\nI would here call special attention to the view of this subject\ngiven on page 57. Here is a short extract: \u201cThe object of the words\nof our Saviour [in Luke 12:33] has not been clearly presented.\u201d I\nsaw that \u201cthe object of selling is not to give to those who are able to\nlabor and support themselves, but to spread the truth. It is a sin to\nsupport and indulge in idleness those who are able to labor. Some\nhave been zealous to attend all the meetings, not to glorify God, but\nfor the \u2018loaves and fishes.\u2019 Such would much better have been at\nhome laboring with their hands, \u2018the thing that is good,\u2019 to supply\nthe wants of their families, and to have something to give to sustain\nthe precious cause.\u201d It has been Satan\u2019s design in times past to push\nout some with a hurried spirit to make a too free use of means,\n108 Early Writings\nand influence the brethren to rashly dispose of their property, that\nthrough an abundance of means thrown out carelessly and hastily,\nsouls might be injured and lost, and that now, when the truth is to be\nspread more extensively, the lack might be felt. His design has, in\nsome degree, been accomplished.\nThe Lord has shown the error of many in looking to those only\nwho have property to support the publication of the paper and tracts.\nAll should act their part. Those who have strength to labor with their\nhands, and earn means to help sustain the cause, are as accountable\nfor it as others are for their property. Every child of God who\nprofesses to believe the present truth, should be zealous to act his\npart in this cause.\nJuly, 1853, I saw that it was not as it should be that the paper,\nowned and approved by God, should come out so seldom. The cause,\nin the time in which we are living, demands the paper weekly, [The[96]\nReview and Herald previous to this time had been published quite\nirregularly and was now issued semimonthly.] and the publication of\nmany more tracts to expose the increasing errors of this time; but the\nwork is hindered for want of means. I saw that the truth must go and\nthat we must not be too fearful, that tracts and papers might better\ngo to three where they were not needed than to have one deprived of\nthem who prizes them and can be benefited by them. I saw that the\nlast-day signs should be brought out clearly, for the manifestations of\nSatan are on the increase. The publications of Satan and his agents\nare increasing, their power is growing, and what we do to get the\ntruth before others must be done quickly.\nI was shown that the truth once published now, will stand, for it\nis the truth for the last days; it will live, and less need be said upon\nit in future. Numberless words need not be put upon paper to justify\nwhat speaks for itself and shines in its clearness. Truth is straight,\nplain, clear, and stands out boldly in its own defense; but it is not so\nwith error. It is so winding and twisting that it needs a multitude of\nwords to explain it in its crooked form. I saw that all the light they\nhad received in some places had come from the paper; that souls had\nreceived the truth in this way, and then talked it to others; and that\nnow in places where there are several, they had been raised up by\nthis silent messenger. It was their only preacher. The cause of truth\nshould not be hindered in its onward progress for want of means.\nGospel Order [97]\nThe Lord has shown that gospel order has been too much feared\nand neglected. [The Adventists were of all churches, and at first\nthey had no idea of forming another church. After 1844 there was\ngreat confusion, and the majority were strongly opposed to any\norganization, holding that it was inconsistent with the perfect liberty\nof the gospel. The testimony and labors of Mrs White have always\nbeen opposed to fanaticism, and in the instruction given through her,\norganization in some form was early insisted upon, as necessary to\nprevent confusion.] Formality should be shunned; but, in so doing,\norder should not be neglected. There is order in heaven. There was\norder in the church when Christ was upon the earth, and after his\ndeparture order was strictly observed among his apostles. And now\nin these last days, while God is bringing his children into the unity\nof the faith, there is more real need of order than ever before; for, as\nGod unites his children, Satan and his evil angels are very busy to\nprevent this unity and to destroy it. Therefore men are hurried into\nthe field who lack wisdom and judgment, perhaps not ruling well\ntheir own house, and not having order or government over the few\nthat God has given them charge of at home; yet they feel capable\nof having charge of the flock. They make many wrong moves, and\nthose unacquainted with our faith judge all the messengers to be like\nthese self-sent men. Thus the cause of God is reproached, and the\ntruth shunned by many unbelievers who would otherwise be candid\nand anxiously inquire, are these things so?\nMen whose lives are not holy and who are unqualified to teach\nthe present truth enter the field without being acknowledged by the\nchurch or the brethren generally, and confusion and disunion are\nthe result. Some have a theory of the truth, and can present the [98]\nargument, but lack spirituality, judgment, and experience; they fail\nin many things which it is very necessary for them to understand\nbefore they can teach the truth. Others have not the argument, but\nbecause a few brethren hear them pray well and give an exciting\n109\n110 Early Writings\nexhortation now and then, they are pressed into the field, to engage\nin a work for which God has not qualified them and for which they\nhave not sufficient experience and judgment. Spiritual pride comes\nin, they are lifted up, and act under the deception of thinking that\nthey are laborers. They do not know themselves. They lack sound\njudgment and patient reasoning, talk boastingly of themselves, and\nassert many things which they cannot prove from the Word. God\nknows this; therefore He does not call such to labor in these perilous\ntimes, and brethren should be careful not to push those out into the\nfield whom He has not called.\nThose men who are not called of God are generally the very ones\nthat are the most confident that they are so called and that their labors\nare very important. They go into the field and do not generally exert\na good influence; yet in some places they have a measure of success,\nand this leads them and others to think that they are surely called of\nGod. It is not a positive evidence that men are called of God because\nthey have some success; for angels of God are now moving upon the\nhearts of His honest children to enlighten their understanding as to\nthe present truth, that they may lay hold upon it and live. And even\nif self-sent men put themselves where God does not put them and\nprofess to be teachers, and souls receive the truth by hearing them\ntalk it, this is no evidence that they are called of God. The souls who\nreceive the truth from them receive it to be brought into trial and\nbondage, as they afterward find that these men were not standing in\nthe counsel of God. Even if wicked men talk the truth, some may[99]\nreceive it; but it does not bring those who talked it into any more\nfavor with God. Wicked men are wicked men still, and according\nto the deception they practiced upon those who were beloved of\nGod, and according to the confusion brought into the church, so will\nbe their punishment; their sins will not remain covered, but will be\nexposed in the day of God\u2019s fierce anger.\nThese self-sent messengers are a curse to the cause. Honest\nsouls put confidence in them, thinking that they are moving in the\ncounsel of God and that they are in union with the church, and\ntherefore suffer them to administer the ordinances, and, as duty is\nmade plain that they must do their first works, allow themselves to\nbe baptized by them. But when light comes, as it surely will, and\nthey are aware that these men are not what they understood them to\nGospel Order 111\nbe, God\u2019s called and chosen messengers, they are thrown into trial\nand doubt as to the truth they have received and feel that they must\nlearn it all over again; they are troubled and perplexed by the enemy\nabout all their experience, whether God has led them or not, and are\nnot satisfied until they are again baptized and begin anew. It is much\nmore wearing to the spirits of God\u2019s messengers to go into places\nwhere those have been who have exerted this wrong influence than\nto enter new fields. God\u2019s servants have to deal plainly, act openly,\nand not cover up wrongs; for they are standing between the living\nand the dead and must render an account of their faithfulness, their\nmission, and the influence they exert over the flock of which the\nLord has made them overseers.\nThose who receive the truth and are brought into such trials\nwould have had the truth the same if these men had stayed away\nand filled the humble place the Lord designed for them. God\u2019s [100]\neye was upon His jewels, and He would have directed to them\nHis called and chosen messengers\u2014men who would have moved\nunderstandingly. The light of truth would have shown and discovered\nto these souls their true position, and they would have received the\ntruth understandingly and been satisfied with its beauty and clearness.\nAnd as they felt its powerful effects, they would have been strong\nand shed a holy influence.\nAgain the danger of those traveling whom God has not called,\nwas shown me. If they do have some success, the qualifications\nthat are lacking will be felt. Injudicious moves will be made, and\nby a lack of wisdom some precious souls may be driven where\nthey can never be reached. I saw that the church should feel their\nresponsibility and should look carefully and attentively at the lives,\nqualifications, and general course of those who profess to be teachers.\nIf unmistakable evidence is not given that God has called them, and\nthat the \u201cwoe\u201d is upon them if they heed not this call, it is the duty\nof the church to act and let it be known that these persons are not\nacknowledged as teachers by the church. This is the only course the\nchurch can take in order to be clear in this matter, for the burden lies\nupon them.\nI saw that this door at which the enemy comes in to perplex\nand trouble the flock can be shut. I inquired of the angel how it\ncould be closed. He said, \u201cThe church must flee to God\u2019s Word and\n112 Early Writings\nbecome established upon gospel order, which has been overlooked\nand neglected.\u201d This is indispensably necessary in order to bring the\nchurch into the unity of the faith. I saw that in the apostles\u2019 day the\nchurch was in danger of being deceived and imposed upon by false\nteachers. Therefore the brethren chose men who had given good\nevidence that they were capable of ruling well their own house and [101]\npreserving order in their own families, and who could enlighten those\nwho were in darkness. Inquiry was made of God concerning these,\nand then, according to the mind of the church and the Holy Ghost,\nthey were set apart by the laying on of hands. Having received their\ncommission from God and having the approbation of the church,\nthey went forth baptizing in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy\nGhost, and administering the ordinances of the Lord\u2019s house, often\nwaiting upon the saints by presenting them the emblems of the\nbroken body and spilt blood of the crucified Saviour, to keep fresh\nin the memory of God\u2019s beloved children His sufferings and death.\nI saw that we are no more secure from false teachers now than\nthey were in the apostles\u2019 days; and, if we do no more, we should\ntake as special measures as they did to secure the peace, harmony,\nand union of the flock. We have their example, and should follow\nit. Brethren of experience and of sound minds should assemble,\nand following the Word of God and the sanction of the Holy Spirit,\nshould, with fervent prayer, lay hands upon those who have given\nfull proof that they have received their commission of God, and set\nthem apart to devote themselves entirely to His work. This act would\nshow the sanction of the church to their going forth as messengers\nto carry the most solemn message ever given to men.\nGod will not entrust the care of His precious flock to men whose\nmind and judgment have been weakened by former errors that they\nhave cherished, such as so-called perfectionism [see Appendix.]\nand Spiritualism, and who, by their course while in these errors,\nhave disgraced themselves and brought reproach upon the cause of\ntruth. Although they may now feel free from error and competent to\ngo forth and to teach this last message, God will not accept them.[102]\nHe will not entrust precious souls to their care; for their judgment\nwas perverted while in error, and is now weakened. The great and\nholy One is a jealous God, and He will have holy men to carry His\ntruth. The holy law spoken by God from Sinai is a part of Himself,\nGospel Order 113\nand holy men who are its strict observers will alone honor Him by\nteaching it to others.\nThe servants of God who teach the truth should be men of judg-\nment. They should be men who can bear opposition and not get\nexcited; for those who oppose the truth will pick at those who teach\nit, and every objection that can be produced, will be brought in its\nworst form to bear against the truth. The servants of God who bear\nthe message must be prepared to remove these objections, with calm-\nness and meekness, by the light of truth. Frequently opposers talk to\nministers of God in a provoking manner, to call out something from\nthem of the same nature, that they can make as much of it as possible\nand declare to others that the teachers of the commandments have\na bitter spirit and are harsh, as has been reported. I saw that we\nmust be prepared for objections, and with patience, judgment, and\nmeekness, let them have the weight they deserve, not throw them\naway or dispose of them by positive assertions, and then bear down\nupon the objector, and manifest a hard spirit toward him; but give\nthe objections their weight, then bring forth the light and the power\nof the truth, and let it outweigh and remove the errors. Thus a good\nimpression will be made, and honest opposers will acknowledge that\nthey have been deceived and that the commandment keepers are not\nwhat they have been represented to be.\nThose who profess to be servants of the living God must be will-\ning to be servants of all, instead of being exalted above the brethren,\nand they must possess a kind, courteous spirit. If they err, they [103]\nshould be ready to confess thoroughly. Honesty of intention cannot\nstand as an excuse for not confessing errors. Confession would not\nlessen the confidence of the church in the messenger, and he would\nset a good example; a spirit of confession would be encouraged in\nthe church, and sweet union would be the result. Those who profess\nto be teachers should be patterns of piety, meekness, and humility,\npossessing a kind spirit, to win souls to Jesus and the truth of the\nBible. A minister of Christ should be pure in conversation and in\nactions. He should ever bear in mind that he is handling words of\ninspiration, words of a holy God. He must also bear in mind that\nthe flock is entrusted to his care, and that he is to bear their cases\nto Jesus, and plead for them as Jesus pleads for us with the Father.\nI was pointed back to the children of Israel anciently and saw how\n114 Early Writings\npure and holy the ministers of the sanctuary had to be, because they\nwere brought by their work into a close connection with God. They\nthat minister must be holy, pure, and without blemish, or God will\ndestroy them. God has not changed. He is just as holy and pure, just\nas particular, as He ever was. Those who profess to be the ministers\nof Jesus should be men of experience and deep piety, and then at all\ntimes and in all places they can shed a holy influence.\nI have seen that it is now time for the messengers to move out\nwherever there is an opening, and that God will go before them\nand open the hearts of some to hear. New places must be entered,\nand, wherever this is done, it would be well, if consistent, to go\ntwo and two, so as to hold up each other\u2019s hands. A plan like this\nwas presented: It would be well for two brethren to start together\nand travel in company to the darkest places, where there is much\nopposition and where the most labor is needed, and with united\nefforts and strong faith set the truth before those in darkness. And[104]\nthen, if they could accomplish more by visiting many places, to\ngo separately, but often meet, while on the tour, to encourage each\nother by their faith, and thereby strengthen and hold up each other\u2019s\nhands. Also, let them consult upon the places opened for them, and\ndecide which of their gifts will be the most needed, and in what way\nthey can have the most success in reaching the heart. Then as they\nseparate again their courage and energy will be renewed to meet\nthe opposition and darkness and to labor with feeling hearts to save\nperishing souls.\nI saw that the servants of God should not go over and over the\nsame field of labor, but should be searching out souls in new places.\nThose who are already established in the truth should not demand\nso much of their labor; for they ought to be able to stand alone, and\nstrengthen others about them, while the messengers of God visit the\ndark and lonely places, setting the truth before those who are not\nnow enlightened as to the present truth.\n* * * * *\nChurch Difficulties\n[From The Review and Herald, August 11, 1853.]\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nAs error is fast progressing, we should seek to be awake in the\ncause of God, and realize the time in which we live. Darkness is\nto cover the earth, and gross darkness the people. And as nearly\nall around us are being enveloped in the thick darkness of error\nand delusion, it becomes us to shake off stupidity and live near to\nGod, where we can draw divine rays of light and glory from the\ncountenance of Jesus. As darkness thickens and error increases,\nwe should obtain a more thorough knowledge of the truth and be [105]\nprepared to maintain our position from the Scriptures.\nWe must be sanctified through the truth, be wholly consecrated\nto God, and so live out our holy profession that the Lord can shed\nincreasing light upon us, and that we may see light in His light,\nand be strengthened with His strength. Every moment that we are\nnot on our watch we are liable to be beset by the enemy and are in\ngreat danger of being overcome by the powers of darkness. Satan\ncommissions his angels to be vigilant and overthrow all they can; to\nfind out the waywardness and besetting sins of those who profess\nthe truth, and throw darkness around them, that they may cease to\nbe watchful, take a course that will dishonor the cause they profess\nto love, and bring sorrow upon the church. The souls of these\nmisguided, unwatchful ones grow darker, and the light of heaven\nfades from them. They cannot discover their besetting sins, and\nSatan weaves his net about them, and they are taken in his snare.\nGod is our strength. We must look to Him for wisdom and\nguidance, and keeping in view His glory, the good of the church,\nand the salvation of our own souls, we must overcome our besetting\nsins. We should individually seek to obtain new victory every day.\nWe must learn to stand alone and depend wholly upon God. The\nsooner we learn this the better. Let each one find out where he fails,\n115\n116 Early Writings\nand then faithfully watch that his sins do not overcome him, but that\nhe gets the victory over them. Then can we have confidence toward\nGod, and great trouble will be saved the church.\nThe messengers of God, as they leave their homes to labor for\nthe salvation of souls, spend much of their time in laboring for those\nwho have been in the truth for years, but who are still weak, because\nthey needlessly let loose the reins, cease watching over themselves,\nand, I sometimes think, tempt the enemy to tempt them. They get[106]\ninto some petty difficulty and trial, and the time of the servants of\nthe Lord is spent to visit them. They are held hours and even days,\nand their souls are grieved and wounded by hearing little difficulties\nand trials talked over, each magnifying his own grievances to make\nthem look as serious as possible, for fear the servants of God will\nthink them too small to be noticed. Instead of depending on the\nLord\u2019s servants to help them out of these trials, they should break\ndown before God and fast and pray until the trials are removed.\nSome seem to think that all that God has called messengers into\nthe field for, is to go at their bidding and to carry them in their arms;\nand that the most important part of their work is to settle the petty\ntrials and difficulties which they have brought upon themselves by\ninjudicious moves, and by giving way to the enemy, and indulging\nan unyielding, faultfinding spirit toward those around them. But\nwhere are the hungry sheep at this time? Starving for the bread\nof life. Those who know the truth and have been established in it,\nbut obey it not\u2014if they did, they would be saved many of these\ntrials\u2014are holding the messengers, and the very object for which\nGod has called them into the field is not accomplished. The servants\nof God are grieved and their courage taken away by such things in\nthe church, when all should strive not to add a feather\u2019s weight to\ntheir burden, but by cheering words and the prayer of faith, should\nhelp them. How much more free would they be if all who profess\nthe truth would look about them and try to help others, instead of\nclaiming so much help themselves. As it is, when the servants of\nGod enter dark places, where the truth has not yet been proclaimed,\nthey carry a wounded spirit caused by the needless trials of their\nbrethren. In addition to all this, they have to meet the unbelief and[107]\nprejudice of opposers and be trampled upon by some.\nChurch Difficulties 117\nHow much easier it would be to affect the heart and how much\nmore would God be glorified if His servants were free from dis-\ncouragement and trial, that they might with a free spirit present the\ntruth in its beauty. Those who have been guilty of requiring so\nmuch labor of God\u2019s servants and burdening them with trials which\nbelong to themselves to settle, will have to give account to God for\nall the time and means that have been spent to gratify themselves,\nthereby satisfying the enemy. They should be in a situation to help\ntheir brethren. They should never defer their trials and difficulties to\nburden a whole meeting, or wait until some of the messengers come\nto settle them; but they should get right before God themselves, have\ntheir trials all out of the way, and be prepared when laborers come\nto hold up their hands instead of weakening them.\n* * * * *\nHope of the Church\n[From The Review and Herald, June 10, 1852.]\nAs I have of late looked around to find the humble followers\nof the meek and lowly Jesus, my mind has been much exercised.\nMany who profess to be looking for the speedy coming of Christ\nare becoming conformed to this world and seek more earnestly the\napplause of those around them than the approbation of God. They\nare cold and formal, like the nominal churches from which they but\na short time since separated. The words addressed to the Laodicean\nchurch describe their present condition perfectly. (See Revelation\n3:14-20.) They are \u201c neither cold nor hot ,\u201d but \u201clukewarm.\u201d And[108]\nunless they heed the counsel of the \u201cfaithful and true Witness,\u201d and\nzealously repent and obtain \u201cgold tried in the fire,\u201d \u201cwhite raiment,\u201d\nand \u201ceye-salve,\u201d He will spew them out of His mouth.\nThe time has come when a large portion of those who once\nrejoiced and shouted aloud for joy in view of the immediate com-\ning of the Lord, are on the ground of the churches and the world\nwho once derided them for believing that Jesus was coming, and\ncirculated all manner of falsehoods to raise prejudice against them\nand destroy their influence. Now, if any one longs after the living\nGod, hungering and thirsting for righteousness, and God gives him\nto feel His power, and satisfies his longing soul by shedding abroad\nHis love in his heart, and if he glorifies God by praising Him, he is,\nby these professed believers in the soon coming of the Lord, often\nconsidered deluded, and charged with being mesmerized or having\nsome wicked spirit.\nMany of these professed Christians dress, talk, and act like the\nworld, and the only thing by which they may be known is their\nprofession. Though they profess to be looking for Christ, their con-\nversation is not in heaven, but on worldly things. \u201cWhat manner of\npersons\u201d ought those to be \u201cin all holy conversation and godliness,\u201d\nwho profess to be \u201clooking for and hasting unto the coming of the\n118\nHope of the Church 119\nday of God.\u201d 2 Peter 3:11, 12. \u201cEvery man that hath this hope in him\npurifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d 1 John 3:3. But it is evident\nthat many who bear the name of Adventist study more to decorate\ntheir bodies and to appear well in the eyes of the world than they do\nto learn from the Word of God how they may be approved of Him.\nWhat if the lovely Jesus, our pattern, should make His appear-\nance among them and the professors of religion generally, as at His\nfirst advent? He was born in a manger. Follow Him through His life [109]\nand ministry. He was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.\nThese professed Christians would be ashamed of the meek and lowly\nSaviour who wore a plain, seamless coat, and had not where to lay\nHis head. His spotless, self-denying life would condemn them; His\nholy solemnity would be a painful restraint upon their lightness and\nvain laughter; His guileless conversation would be a check to their\nworldly and covetous conversation; His declaring the unvarnished,\ncutting truth, would manifest their real character, and they would\nwish to get the meek pattern, the lovely Jesus, out of the way as soon\nas possible. They would be among the first to try to catch Him in\nHis words, and raise the cry, \u201cCrucify Him! Crucify Him!\u201d\nLet us follow Jesus as He so meekly rode into Jerusalem, when\n\u201cthe whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise\nGod with a loud voice, ... saying, Blessed be the King that cometh\nin the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.\nAnd some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto\nHim, Master, rebuke Thy disciples. And He answered and said\nunto them, I tell you that if these should hold their peace, the stones\nwould immediately cry out.\u201d A large portion of those who profess\nto be looking for Christ would be as forward as the Pharisees were\nto have the disciples silenced, and they would doubtless raise the\ncry, \u201cFanaticism! Mesmerism! Mesmerism!\u201d And the disciples,\nspreading their garments and branches of palm trees in the way,\nwould be thought extravagant and wild. But God will have a people\non the earth who will not be so cold and dead but that they can praise\nand glorify Him. He will receive glory from some people, and if\nthose of His choice, those who keep His commandments, should\nhold their peace, the very stones would cry out.\nJesus is coming, but not as at His first advent, a babe in Bethle- [110]\nhem; not as He rode into Jerusalem, when the disciples praised God\n120 Early Writings\nwith a loud voice and cried, \u201cHosanna\u201d; but in the glory of the Father\nand with all the retinue of holy angels to escort Him on His way to\nearth. All heaven will be emptied of the angels, while the waiting\nsaints will be looking for Him and gazing into heaven, as were the\nmen of Galilee when He ascended from the Mount of Olivet. Then\nonly those who are holy, those who have followed fully the meek\nPattern, will with rapturous joy exclaim as they behold Him, \u201cLo,\nthis is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us.\u201d And\nthey will be changed \u201cin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the\nlast trump\u201d\u2014that trump which wakes the sleeping saints, and calls\nthem forth from their dusty beds, clothed with glorious immortality,\nand shouting, \u201cVictory! Victory over death and the grave!\u201d The\nchanged saints are then caught up together with the angels to meet\nthe Lord in the air, never more to be separated from the object of\ntheir love.\nWith such a prospect as this before us, such a glorious hope, such\na redemption that Christ has purchased for us by His own blood,\nshall we hold our peace? Shall we not praise God even with a loud\nvoice, as did the disciples when Jesus rode into Jerusalem? Is not our\nprospect far more glorious than was theirs? Who dare then forbid\nus glorifying God, even with a loud voice, when we have such a\nhope, big with immortality, and full of glory? We have tasted of the\npowers of the world to come, and long for more. My whole being\ncries out after the living God, and I shall not be satisfied until I am\nfilled with all His fullness.\nPreparation for Christ\u2019s Coming [111]\n[From The Review and Herald, February 17, 1853.]\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nDo we believe with all the heart that Christ is soon coming and\nthat we are now having the last message of mercy that is ever to be\ngiven to a guilty world? Is our example what it should be? Do we,\nby our lives and holy conversation, show to those around us that we\nare looking for the glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus\nChrist, who shall change these vile bodies and fashion them like\nunto His glorious body? I fear that we do not believe and realize\nthese things as we should. Those who believe the important truths\nthat we profess, should act out their faith. There is too much seeking\nafter amusements and things to take the attention in this world; the\nmind is left to run too much upon dress, and the tongue is engaged\ntoo often in light and trifling conversation, which gives the lie to our\nprofession, for our conversation is not in heaven, whence we look\nfor the Saviour.\nAngels are watching over and guarding us; we often grieve these\nangels by indulging in trifling conversation, jesting, and joking, and\nalso by sinking down into a careless, stupid state. Although we may\nnow and then make an effort for the victory and obtain it, yet if we\ndo not keep it, but sink down into the same careless, indifferent state,\nunable to endure temptations and resist the enemy, we do not endure\nthe trial of our faith that is more precious than gold. We are not\nsuffering for Christ\u2019s sake, and glorying in tribulation.\nThere is a great lack of Christian fortitude and serving God from\nprinciple. We should not seek to please and gratify self, but to honor [112]\nand glorify God, and in all we do and say to have an eye single to\nHis glory. If we would let our hearts be impressed with the following\nimportant words, and ever bear them in mind, we should not so easily\nfall into temptation and our words would be few and well chosen:\n\u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our\n121\n122 Early Writings\niniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with\nHis stripes we are healed.\u201d \u201cEvery idle word that men shall speak,\nthey shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\u201d \u201cThou God\nseest me.\u201d\nWe could not think of these important words, and call to mind\nthe sufferings of Jesus that we poor sinners might receive pardon\nand be redeemed unto God by His most precious blood, without\nfeeling a holy restraint upon us and an earnest desire to suffer for\nHim who suffered and endured so much for us. If we dwell on these\nthings, dear self, with its dignity, will be humbled, and its place will\nbe occupied by a childlike simplicity which will bear reproof from\nothers and will not be easily provoked. A self-willed spirit will not\nthen come in to rule the soul.\nThe true Christian\u2019s joys and consolation must and will be in\nheaven. The longing souls of those who have tasted of the powers\nof the world to come and have feasted on heavenly joys, will not be\nsatisfied with things of earth. Such will find enough to do in their\nleisure moments. Their souls will be drawn out after God. Where\nthe treasure is, there will the heart be, holding sweet communion\nwith the God they love and worship. Their amusement will be in\ncontemplating their treasure\u2014the Holy City, the earth made new,\ntheir eternal home. And while they dwell upon those things which\nare lofty, pure, and holy, heaven will be brought near, and they will\nfeel the power of the Holy Spirit, and this will tend to wean them[113]\nmore and more from the world and cause their consolation and chief\njoy to be in the things of heaven, their sweet home. The power\nof attraction to God and heaven will then be so great that nothing\ncan draw their minds from the great object of securing the soul\u2019s\nsalvation and honoring and glorifying God.\nAs I realize how much has been done for us to keep us right, I\nam led to exclaim, Oh, what love, what wondrous love, hath the Son\nof God for us poor sinners! Should we be stupid and careless while\neverything is being done for our salvation that can be done? All\nheaven is interested for us. We should be alive and awake to honor,\nglorify, and adore the high and lofty One. Our hearts should flow\nout in love and gratitude to Him who has been so full of love and\ncompassion to us. With our lives we should honor Him, and with\npure and holy conversation show that we are born from above, that\nPreparation for Christ\u2019s Coming 123\nthis world is not our home, but that we are pilgrims and strangers\nhere, traveling to a better country.\nMany who profess the name of Christ and claim to be looking\nfor His speedy coming, know not what it is to suffer for Christ\u2019s\nsake. Their hearts are not subdued by grace, and they are not dead\nto self, as is often shown in various ways. At the same time they\nare talking of having trials. But the principal cause of their trials is\nan unsubdued heart, which makes self so sensitive that it is often\ncrossed. If such could realize what it is to be a humble follower of\nChrist, a true Christian, they would begin to work in good earnest\nand begin right. They would first die to self, then be instant in prayer,\nand check every passion of the heart. Give up your self-confidence\nand self-sufficiency, brethren, and follow the meek Pattern. Ever\nkeep Jesus in your mind that He is your example and you must tread [114]\nin His footsteps. Look unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our\nfaith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross,\ndespising the shame. He endured the contradiction of sinners against\nHimself. He for our sins was once the meek, slain lamb, wounded,\nbruised, smitten, and afflicted.\nLet us, then, cheerfully suffer something for Jesus\u2019 sake, crucify\nself daily, and be partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings here, that we may\nbe made partakers with Him of His glory, and be crowned with glory,\nhonor, immortality, and eternal life.\n* * * * *\nFaithfulness in Social Meeting\nThe Lord has shown me that great interest should be taken by\nSabbathkeepers to keep up their meetings and make them interesting.\nThere is great necessity of more interest and energy being manifested\nin this direction. All should have something to say for the Lord, for\nby so doing they will be blest. A book of remembrance is written\nof those who do not forsake the assembling of themselves together,\nbut speak often one to another. The remnant are to overcome by the\nblood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony. Some expect\nto overcome alone by the blood of the Lamb, without making any\nspecial effort of their own. I saw that God has been merciful in\ngiving us the power of speech. He has given us a tongue, and we\nare accountable to Him for its use. We should glorify God with our\nmouth, speaking in honor of the truth and of His unbounded mercy,\nand overcome by the word of our testimony through the blood of the\nLamb.\nWe should not come together to remain silent; those only are[115]\nremembered of the Lord who assemble to speak of His honor and\nglory and tell of His power; upon such the blessing of God will rest,\nand they will be refreshed. If all moved as they should, no precious\ntime would run to waste, and no reproofs would be needed for long\nprayers and exhortations; all the time would be occupied by short,\npointed testimonies and prayers. Ask, believe, and receive. There is\ntoo much mocking the Lord, too much praying that is no praying and\nthat wearies angels and displeases God, too many vain, unmeaning\npetitions. First we should feel needy, and then ask God for the very\nthings we need, believing that He gives them to us, even while we\nask; and then our faith will grow, all will be edified, the weak will be\nstrengthened, and the discouraged and desponding made to look up\nand believe that God is a rewarder of all those who diligently seek\nHim.\nSome hold back in meeting because they have nothing new to say\nand must repeat the same story if they speak. I saw that pride was at\n124\nFaithfulness in Social Meeting 125\nthe bottom of this, that God and angels witnessed the testimonies of\nthe saints and were well pleased and glorified by their being repeated\nweekly. The Lord loves simplicity and humility, but He is displeased\nand angels are grieved when professed heirs of God and joint heirs\nwith Jesus suffer precious time to run to waste in their meetings.\nIf the brethren and sisters were in the place they should be, they\nwould not be at a loss to find something to say in honor of Jesus,\nwho hung upon Calvary\u2019s cross for their sins. If they would cherish\nmore of a realizing sense of the condescension of God in giving His\nonly beloved Son to die a sacrifice for our sins and transgressions,\nand of the sufferings and anguish of Jesus to make a way of escape\nfor guilty man, that he might receive pardon and live, they would be [116]\nmore ready to extol and magnify Jesus. They could not hold their\npeace, but with thankfulness and gratitude would talk of His glory\nand tell of His power. And blessings from God would rest upon them\nby so doing. Even if the same story were repeated, God would be\nglorified. The angel showed me those who ceased not day nor night\nto cry, \u201cHoly, Holy, Lord God Almighty.\u201d \u201cContinued repetition,\u201d\nsaid the angel, \u201cyet God is glorified by it.\u201d Although we may tell the\nsame story over and over, it honors God, and shows that we are not\nunmindful of His goodness and mercies to us.\nI saw that the nominal churches have fallen; that coldness and\ndeath reign in their midst. If they would follow the Word of God, it\nwould humble them. But they get above the work of the Lord. It is\ntoo humiliating for them to repeat the same simple story of God\u2019s\ngoodness when they meet together, and they study to get something\nnew, something great, and to have their words exact to the ear and\npleasing to man, and God\u2019s Spirit leaves them. When we follow\nthe humble Bible way, we shall have the movings of the Spirit of\nGod. All will be in sweet harmony if we follow the humble channel\nof truth, depending wholly upon God, and there will be no danger\nof being affected by the evil angels. It is when souls get above the\nSpirit of God, moving in their own strength, that the angels cease\nwatching over them, and they are left to the buffetings of Satan.\nDuties are laid down in God\u2019s Word, the performance of which\nwill keep the people of God humble and separate from the world, and\nfrom backsliding, like the nominal churches. The washing of feet and\npartaking of the Lord\u2019s supper should be more frequently practiced.\n126 Early Writings\nJesus set us the example, and told us to do as He had done. I saw that\nHis example should be as exactly followed as possible; yet brethren[117]\nand sisters have not always moved as judiciously as they should in\nwashing feet, and confusion has been caused. It should be introduced\ninto new places with carefulness and wisdom, especially where the\npeople are not informed relative to the example and teachings of our\nLord on this point, and where they have prejudice against it. Many\nhonest souls, through the influence of former teachers in whom they\nhad confidence, are much prejudiced against this plain duty, and the\nsubject should be introduced to them in a proper time and manner.\nThere is no example given in the Word for brethren to wash\nsisters\u2019 feet; [see Appendix.] but there is an example for sisters to\nwash the feet of brethren. Mary washed the feet of Jesus with her\ntears, and wiped them with the hair of her head. (See also 1 Timothy\n5:10.) I saw that the Lord had moved upon sisters to wash the feet\nof brethren and that it was according to gospel order. All should\nmove understandingly and not make the washing of feet a tedious\nceremony.\nThe holy salutation mentioned in the gospel of Jesus Christ by\nthe apostle Paul should ever be considered in its true character. It\nis a holy kiss . [see Appendix.] It should be regarded as a sign of\nfellowship to Christian friends when parting, and when meeting\nagain after a separation of weeks or months. In 1 Thessalonians 5:26\nPaul says: \u201cGreet all the brethren with an holy kiss.\u201d In the same\nchapter he says: \u201cAbstain from all appearance of evil.\u201d There can be\nno appearance of evil when the holy kiss is given at a proper time\nand place.\nI saw that the strong hand of the enemy is set against the work\nof God, and the help and strength of everyone who loves the cause\nof truth should be enlisted; great interest should be manifested by\nthem to uphold the hands of those who advocate the truth, that by[118]\nsteady watchcare they may shut out the enemy. All should stand as\none, united in the work. Every energy of the soul should be awake,\nfor what is done must be done quickly.\nI then saw the third angel. Said my accompanying angel, \u201cFearful\nis his work. Awful is his mission. He is the angel that is to select the\nwheat from the tares, and seal, or bind, the wheat for the heavenly\nFaithfulness in Social Meeting 127\ngarner. These things should engross the whole mind, the whole\nattention.\u201d\n* * * * *\nTo the Inexperienced\nSome, I saw, have not a realizing sense of the importance of the\ntruth or of its effect, and moving from the impulse of the moment or\nfrom excitement, often follow their feelings and disregard church\norder. Such seem to think that religion consists chiefly in making a\nnoise. [see Appendix.] Some who have but just received the truth of\nthe third angel\u2019s message are ready to reprove and teach those who\nhave been established in the truth for years, and who have suffered\nfor its sake and felt its sanctifying power. Those who are so puffed\nup by the enemy will have to feel the sanctifying influence of the\ntruth and obtain a realizing sense of how it found them\u2014\u201cwretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d When the truth\nbegins to purify them and purge away their dross and tin, as it surely\nwill when it is received in the love of it, the one who has this great\nwork done for him will not feel that he is rich and increased in goods\nand has need of nothing.\nThose who profess the truth and think they know it all before\nthey have learned its first principles, and who are forward to take\nthe place of teachers and reprove those who for years have stood\nstiffly for the truth, plainly show that they have no understanding[119]\nof the truth, and know none of its effects; for if they knew any\nof the sanctifying power, they should yield the peaceable fruits of\nrighteousness and be humbled under its sweet, powerful influence.\nThey would bear fruit to the glory of God, and understand what the\ntruth has done for them, and esteem others better than themselves.\nI saw that the remnant were not prepared for what is coming upon\nthe earth. Stupidity, like lethargy, seemed to hang upon the minds\nof most of those who profess to believe that we are having the last\nmessage. My accompanying angel cried out with awful solemnity,\n\u201cGet ready! get ready! get ready! for the fierce anger of the Lord is\nsoon to come. His wrath is to be poured out, unmixed with mercy,\nand ye are not ready. Rend the heart, and not the garment. A great\nwork must be done for the remnant. Many of them are dwelling\n128\nTo the Inexperienced 129\nupon little trials.\u201d Said the angel, \u201cLegions of evil angels are around\nyou, and are trying to press in their awful darkness, that ye may\nbe ensnared and taken. Ye suffer your minds to be diverted too\nreadily from the work of preparation and the all-important truths for\nthese last days. And ye dwell upon little trials and go into minute\nparticulars of little difficulties to explain them to the satisfaction of\nthis one or that.\u201d Conversation has been protracted for hours between\nthe parties concerned, and not only has their time been wasted, but\nthe servants of God are held to listen to them, when the hearts of\nboth parties are unsubdued by grace. If pride and selfishness were\nlaid aside, five minutes would remove most difficulties. Angels\nhave been grieved and God displeased by the hours which have been\nspent in justifying self. I saw that God will not bow down and listen\nto long justifications, and He does not want His servants to do so,\nand thus precious time be wasted that should be spent in showing [120]\ntransgressors the error of their ways and pulling souls out of the fire.\nI saw that God\u2019s people are on the enchanted ground, and that\nsome have lost nearly all sense of the shortness of time and the\nworth of the soul. Pride has crept in among Sabbathkeepers\u2014pride\nof dress and appearance. Said the angel, \u201cSabbathkeepers will have\nto die to self, die to pride and love of approbation.\u201d\nTruth, saving truth, must be given to the starving people who are\nin darkness. I saw that many prayed for God to humble them; but if\nGod should answer their prayers, it would be by terrible things in\nrighteousness. It was their duty to humble themselves. I saw that if\nself-exaltation was suffered to come in, it would surely lead souls\nastray, and if not overcome would prove their ruin. When one begins\nto get lifted up in his own eyes and thinks he can do something, the\nSpirit of God is withdrawn, and he goes on in his own strength until\nhe is overthrown. I saw that one saint, if he were right, could move\nthe arm of God; but a multitude together, if they were wrong, would\nbe weak and could effect nothing.\nMany have unsubdued, unhumbled hearts, and think more of\ntheir own little grievances and trials than of the souls of sinners. If\nthey had the glory of God in view, they would feel for perishing souls\naround them; and as they realized their perilous situation, would\ntake hold with energy, exercising faith in God, and hold up the hands\nof His servants, that they might boldly, yet in love, declare the truth\n130 Early Writings\nand warn souls to lay hold upon it before the sweet voice of mercy\nshould die away. Said the angel, \u201cThose who profess His name are\nnot ready.\u201d I saw that the seven last plagues were coming upon the\nshelterless heads of the wicked; and then those who have stood in\ntheir way will hear the bitter reproaches of sinners, and their hearts[121]\nwill faint within them.\nSaid the angel. \u201cYe have been picking at straws\u2014dwelling upon\nlittle trials\u2014and sinners must be lost as a consequence.\u201d God is\nwilling to work for us in our meetings, and it is His pleasure to work.\nBut Satan says, \u201cI will hinder the work.\u201d His agents say, \u201cAmen.\u201d\nProfessed believers in the truth dwell upon their petty trials and\ndifficulties which Satan has magnified before them. Time is wasted\nthat can never be recalled. The enemies of the truth have seen our\nweakness, God has been grieved, Christ wounded. Satan\u2019s object is\naccomplished, his plans have succeeded, and he triumphs.\n* * * * *\nSelf-Denial\nI saw that there was danger of the saints making too great prepa-\nrations for conferences; that some were cumbered with too much\nserving; that the appetite must be denied. There is danger of some\nattending the meetings for the loaves and fishes. I saw that all those\nwho are indulging self by using the filthy weed tobacco, should lay\nit aside and put their means to a better use. Those make a sacrifice\nwho deprive themselves of some gratification and take the means\nthey formerly used to gratify the appetite and put it into the treasury\nof the Lord. Like the widow\u2019s two mites, such gifts will be noticed\nof God. The amount may be small; but if all will do this, it will\ntell in the treasury. If all would study to be more economical in\ntheir articles of dress, depriving themselves of some things which\nare not actually necessary and should lay aside such useless and\ninjurious things as tea and coffee, giving to the cause what these [122]\ncost, they would receive more blessings here and a reward in heaven.\nMany think that because God has given them the means, they may\nlive almost above want, can have rich food, and clothe themselves\nabundantly, and that it is no virtue to deny themselves when they\nhave enough. Such do not sacrifice. If they would live a little poorer\nand give to the cause of God to help forward the truth, it would be a\nsacrifice on their part, and when God rewards every man according\nto his works, it would be remembered by Him.\n131\nIrreverence\nI saw that God\u2019s holy name should be used with reverence and\nawe. The words God Almighty are coupled together and used by\nsome in prayer in a careless, thoughtless manner, which is displeas-\ning to Him. Such have no realizing sense of God or the truth, or\nthey would not speak so irreverently of the great and dreadful God,\nwho is soon to judge them in the last day. Said the angel, \u201cCouple\nthem not together; for fearful is His name.\u201d Those who realize the\ngreatness and majesty of God, will take His name on their lips with\nholy awe. He dwelleth in light unapproachable; no man can see\nHim and live. I saw that these things will have to be understood and\ncorrected before the church can prosper.\n132\nFalse Shepherds\nI have been shown that the false shepherds were drunk, but [123]\nnot with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. The truth\nof God is sealed up to them; they cannot read it. When they are\ninterrogated as to what the seventh-day Sabbath is, whether or not\nit is the true Sabbath of the Bible, they lead the mind to fables. I\nsaw that these prophets were like the foxes of the desert. They have\nnot gone up into the gaps, they have not made up the hedge that\nthe people of God may stand in the battle in the day of the Lord.\nWhen the minds of any get stirred up, and they begin to inquire of\nthese false shepherds about the truth, they take the easiest and best\nmanner to effect their object and quiet the minds of the inquiring\nones, even changing their own position to do it. Light has shone on\nmany of these shepherds, but they would not acknowledge it and\nhave changed their position a number of times to evade the truth\nand get away from the conclusions that they must come to if they\ncontinued in their former position. The power of truth tore up their\nfoundation, but instead of yielding to it they would get up another\nplatform that they were not satisfied with themselves.\nI saw that many of these shepherds had denied the past teachings\nof God; they had denied and rejected the glorious truths which\nthey once zealously advocated and had covered themselves with\nmesmerism and all kinds of delusions. I saw that they were drunken\nwith error and were leading on their flock to death. Many of the\nopposers of God\u2019s truth devise mischief in their heads upon their\nbeds, and in the day they carry out their wicked devices to put down\nthe truth and to get something new to interest the people and divert [124]\ntheir minds from the precious, all-important truth.\nI saw that the priests who are leading on their flock to death are\nsoon to be arrested in their dreadful career. The plagues of God are\ncoming, but it will not be sufficient for the false shepherds to be\ntormented with one or two of these plagues. God\u2019s hand at that time\nwill be stretched out still in wrath and justice and will not be brought\n133\n134 Early Writings\nto Himself again until His purposes are fully accomplished, and the\nhireling priests are led to worship at the feet of the saints, and to\nacknowledge that God has loved them because they held fast the\ntruth and kept God\u2019s commandments, and until all the unrighteous\nones are destroyed from the earth.\nThe different parties of professed Advent believers have each a\nlittle truth, but God has given all these truths to His children who\nare being prepared for the day of God. He has also given them\ntruths that none of these parties know, neither will they understand.\nThings which are sealed up to them, the Lord has opened to those\nwho will see and are ready to understand. If God has any new light\nto communicate, He will let His chosen and beloved understand it,\nwithout their going to have their minds enlightened by hearing those\nwho are in darkness and error.\nI was shown the necessity of those who believe that we are\nhaving the last message of mercy, being separate from those who\nare daily imbibing new errors. I saw that neither young nor old\nshould attend their meetings; for it is wrong to thus encourage them\nwhile they teach error that is a deadly poison to the soul and teach\nfor doctrines the commandments of men. The influence of such\ngatherings is not good. If God has delivered us from such darkness\nand error, we should stand fast in the liberty wherewith He has set\nus free and rejoice in the truth. God is displeased with us when[125]\nwe go to listen to error, without being obliged to go; for unless He\nsends us to those meetings where error is forced home to the people\nby the power of the will, He will not keep us. The angels cease\ntheir watchful care over us, and we are left to the buffetings of the\nenemy, to be darkened and weakened by him and the power of his\nevil angels; and the light around us becomes contaminated with the\ndarkness.\nI saw that we have no time to throw away in listening to fables.\nOur minds should not be thus diverted, but should be occupied with\nthe present truth, and seeking wisdom that we may obtain a more\nthorough knowledge of our position, that with meekness we may be\nable to give a reason of our hope from the Scriptures. While false\ndoctrines and dangerous errors are pressed upon the mind, it cannot\nbe dwelling upon the truth which is to fit and prepare the house of\nIsrael to stand in the day of the Lord.\nFalse Shepherds 135\n* * * * *\nGod\u2019s Gift to Man\nI have been shown the great love and condescension of God in\ngiving His Son to die that man might find pardon and live. I was\nshown Adam and Eve, who were privileged to behold the beauty\nand loveliness of the Garden of Eden and were permitted to eat of all\nthe trees in the garden except one. But the serpent tempted Eve, and\nshe tempted her husband, and they both ate of the forbidden tree.\nThey broke God\u2019s command, and became sinners. The news spread\nthrough heaven, and every harp was hushed. The angels sorrowed,\nand feared lest Adam and Eve would again put forth the hand and\neat of the tree of life and be immortal sinners. But God said that He\nwould drive the transgressors from the garden, and by cherubim and[126]\na flaming sword would guard the way of the tree of life, so that man\ncould not approach unto it and eat of its fruit, which perpetuates\nimmortality.\nSorrow filled heaven as it was realized that man was lost and\nthat the world which God had created was to be filled with mortals\ndoomed to misery, sickness, and death, and that there was no way of\nescape for the offender. The whole family of Adam must die. I then\nsaw the lovely Jesus and beheld an expression of sympathy and sor-\nrow upon His countenance. Soon I saw Him approach the exceeding\nbright light which enshrouded the Father. Said my accompanying\nangel, \u201cHe is in close converse with His Father.\u201d The anxiety of the\nangels seemed to be intense while Jesus was communing with His\nFather. Three times He was shut in by the glorious light about the\nFather, and the third time He came from the Father we could see\nHis person. His countenance was calm, free from all perplexity and\ntrouble, and shone with a loveliness which words cannot describe.\nHe then made known to the angelic choir that a way of escape had\nbeen made for lost man; that He had been pleading with His Father,\nand had obtained permission to give His own life as a ransom for\nthe race, to bear their sins, and take the sentence of death upon Him-\nself, thus opening a way whereby they might, through the merits of\n136\nGod\u2019s Gift to Man 137\nHis blood, find pardon for past transgressions, and by obedience be\nbrought back to the garden from which they were driven. Then they\ncould again have access to the glorious, immortal fruit of the tree of\nlife to which they had now forfeited all right.\nThen joy, inexpressible joy, filled heaven, and the heavenly choir\nsang a song of praise and adoration. They touched their harps and\nsang a note higher than they had done before, because of the great\nmercy and condescension of God in yielding up His dearly Beloved [127]\nto die for a race of rebels. Then praise and adoration was poured\nforth for the self-denial and sacrifice of Jesus, in consenting to leave\nthe bosom of His Father, and choosing a life of suffering and anguish,\nand an ignominious death, that He might give life to others.\nSaid the angel, \u201cThink ye that the Father yielded up His dearly\nbeloved Son without a struggle? No, no.\u201d It was even a struggle with\nthe God of heaven, whether to let guilty man perish, or to give His\ndarling Son to die for them. Angels were so interested for man\u2019s\nsalvation that there could be found among them those who would\nyield their glory and give their life for perishing man. \u201cBut,\u201d said my\naccompanying angel, \u201cthat would avail nothing.\u201d The transgression\nwas so great that an angel\u2019s life would not pay the debt. Nothing but\nthe death and intercession of God\u2019s Son would pay the debt and save\nlost man from hopeless sorrow and misery.\nBut the work which was assigned the angels was to ascend and\ndescend with strengthening balm from glory to soothe the Son of\nGod in His life of suffering. They administered unto Jesus. Also,\ntheir work was to guard and keep the subjects of grace from the evil\nangels and from the darkness which was constantly thrown around\nthem by Satan. I saw that it was impossible for God to change His\nlaw in order to save lost, perishing man; therefore He suffered His\ndarling Son to die for man\u2019s transgressions.\n138 Early Writings\nSpiritual Gifts, Vol. 1 [128]\n[129]\n[130]\n[131]\n[132]\n[133]\nIntroduction\nThe gift of prophecy was manifested in the church during the\nJewish dispensation. If it disappeared for a few centuries, on account\nof the corrupt state of the church toward the close of that dispensa-\ntion, it reappeared at its close to usher in the Messiah. Zacharias,\nthe father of John the Baptist, \u201cwas filled with the Holy Ghost, and\nprophesied.\u201d Simeon, a just and devout man who was \u201cwaiting for\nthe consolation of Israel,\u201d came by the Spirit into the temple, and\nprophesied of Jesus as \u201ca light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory\nof Thy people Israel\u201d; and Anna, a prophetess, \u201cspake of Him to all\nthem that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.\u201d And there was no\ngreater prophet than John the Baptist, who was chosen of God to\nintroduce to Israel \u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of\nthe world.\u201d\nThe Christian age commenced with the outpouring of the Spirit,\nand a great variety of spiritual gifts was manifested among the be-\nlievers. These were so abundant that Paul could say to the Corinthian\nchurch, \u201cThe manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to\nprofit withal\u201d\u2014to every man in the church, not to every man in the\nworld, as many have applied it.\nSince the great apostasy, these gifts have rarely been manifested;\nand this is probably the reason why professed Christians generally\nbelieve that they were limited to the period of the primitive church.\nBut is it not on account of the errors and unbelief of the church\nthat the gifts have ceased? And when the people of God shall\nattain to primitive faith and practice, as they certainly will by the\nproclamation of the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus,\nwill not \u201cthe latter rain\u201d Again develop the gifts? Reasoning from\nanalogy we should expect it. Notwithstanding the apostasies of the[134]\nJewish age, it opened and closed with special manifestations of the\nSpirit of God. And it is unreasonable to suppose that the Christian\nage\u2014the light of which, compared with the former dispensation, is\nas the light of the sun compared with the feeble rays of the moon\u2014\n140\nIntroduction 141\nshould commence in glory and close in obscurity. And since a\nspecial work of the Spirit was necessary to prepare a people for the\nfirst advent of Christ, how much more so for the second; especially\nsince the last days were to be perilous beyond all precedent, and\nfalse prophets were to have power to show great signs and wonders,\ninsomuch that, if it were possible, they should deceive the very elect.\nBut to the Scriptures of truth:\n\u201cAnd He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach\nthe gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall\nbe saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs\nshall follow them that believe: In My name shall they cast out devils;\nthey shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and\nif they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay\nhands on the sick, and they shall recover.\u201d Mark 16:15-18.\nCampbell\u2019s translation says, \u201cThese miraculous powers shall\nattend the believers.\u201d The gifts were not confined to the apostles, but\nextended to the believers. Who will have them? Those that believe.\nHow long? There is no limitation; the promise runs parallel with the\ngreat commission to preach the gospel and reaches the last believer.\nBut it is objected that this aid was promised only to the apostles\nand to those who believed through their preaching; that they fulfilled\nthe commission, established the gospel, and that the gifts ceased\nwith that generation. Let us see if the great commission ended with\nthat generation. Matthew 28:19, 20. \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach [135]\nall nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the\nSon, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to observe all things\nwhatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway,\neven unto the end of the world.\u201d\nThat the preaching of the gospel under this commission did not\nend with the primitive church is evident from the promise, \u201cI am\nwith you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d He does not say,\nI am with you, apostles, everywhere, even to the ends of the earth;\nbut I am with you always, to the end of the world, or age. It will not\ndo to say that the Jewish age is meant, for that had already ended\nat the cross. I conclude, then, that the preaching and the belief of\nthe primitive gospel will always be attended with the same spiritual\naid. The apostles\u2019 commission belonged to the Christian age, and\nembraced the whole of it. Consequently the gifts were lost only\n142 Early Writings\nthrough apostasy, and will be revived with the revival of primitive\nfaith and practice.\nIn 1 Corinthians 12:28, we are informed that God hath set,\nplaced, or fixed, certain spiritual gifts in the church. In the ab-\nsence of any scriptural proof that He has removed or abolished them,\nwe must conclude that they were intended to remain. Where is the\nproof then that they are abolished? In the same chapter where the\nJewish Sabbath is abolished, and the Christian Sabbath instituted\u2014a\nchapter in the acts of the mystery of iniquity and the man of sin.\nBut the objector claims Bible proof that gifts were to cease, con-\ntained in the following text: \u201cCharity never faileth: but whether\nthere be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they\nshall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For\nwe know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is\nperfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When[136]\nI was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as\na child: But when I became a man, I put away childish things. For\nnow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: Now I\nknow in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. And\nnow abideth faith, hope, charity.\u201d 1 Corinthians 13:8-13.\nThis text does foretell the cessation of spiritual gifts, also of faith\nand hope. But when were they to cease? We still look forward to the\ntime when\u2014\n\u201cHope shall change to glad fruition, faith to sight, and\nprayer to praise.\u201d\nThey are to cease when that which is perfect is come, when we\nshall no longer see through a glass darkly, but face to face. The\nperfect day, when the just are made perfect and see as they are seen,\nis yet in the future. It is true that the man of sin, when arrived\nat manhood, had put away such \u201cchildish things\u201d as prophecies,\ntongues, and knowledge, and also the faith, hope, and charity of the\nprimitive Christians. But there is nothing in the text to show that\nGod designed to take away the gifts which he had set in the church,\ntill the consummation of her faith and hope, till the surpassing glory\nof the immortal state should eclipse the most brilliant displays of\nspiritual power and knowledge ever manifested in this mortal state.\nIntroduction 143\nThe objection founded upon 2 Timothy 3:16, which some have\ngravely presented, deserves no more than a passing remark. If Paul,\nin saying that the Scriptures are to make the man of God perfect,\nthoroughly furnished unto all good works, meant that nothing more\nshould be written by inspiration, why was he at that moment adding\nto those Scriptures? At least why did he not drop the pen as soon as\nthat sentence was written? And why did John, thirty years afterward,\nwrite the book of Revelation? This book contains another text which [137]\nis quoted to prove the abolition of spiritual gifts.\n\u201cFor I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the\nprophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God\nshall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if\nany man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy,\nGod shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the\nHoly City, and from the things which are written in this book.\u201d\nRevelation 22:18, 19.\nFrom this text it is claimed that God, who at sundry times and in\ndivers manners spake in time past to the fathers by the prophets, and,\nin the commencement of the gospel day, by Jesus and His apostles,\nhas hereby solemnly promised never to communicate anything more\nto man in that way. Therefore all prophesying after this date must be\nfalse. This, it is said, closes the canon of inspiration. If so, why did\nJohn write his gospel after his return from Patmos to Ephesus? In\ndoing so did he add to the words of the prophecy of that book written\nin the isle of Patmos? It is evident, from the text, that the caution\nagainst adding to, or taking from, refers not to the Bible as we have\nthe volume compiled, but to the separate book of Revelation, as it\ncame from the hand of the apostle. Yet no man has a right to add to,\nor subtract from, any other book written by inspiration of God. Did\nJohn, in writing the book of Revelation, add anything to the book\nof Daniel\u2019s prophecy? Not at all. A prophet has no right to alter the\nword of God. But the visions of John corroborate those of Daniel\nand give much additional light upon the subjects there introduced. I\nconclude, then, that the Lord has not bound Himself to keep silence,\nbut is still at liberty to speak. Ever be it the language of my heart,\nSpeak, Lord, through whom Thou wilt; Thy servant heareth.\nThus the attempt to prove from Scripture the abolition of spiritual [138]\ngifts, proves a total failure. And since the gates of hades have not\n144 Early Writings\nprevailed against the church, but God still has a people on earth, we\nmay look for the development of the gifts in connection with the\nthird angel\u2019s message, a message which will bring back the church\nto apostolic ground and make it indeed the light\u2014not darkness\u2014of\nthe world.\nAgain: we are forewarned that there would be false prophets\nin the last days, and the Bible gives a test by which to try their\nteachings in order that we may distinguish between the true and the\nfalse. The grand test is the law of God, which is applied both to the\nprophesyings and to the moral character of the prophets. If there\nwere to be no true prophesyings in the last days, how much easier to\nhave stated the fact, and thus cut off all chance for deception, than\nto give a test by which to try them, as if there would be the genuine\nas well as the false.\nIn Isaiah 8:19, 20, is a prophecy of the familiar spirits of the\npresent time, and the law is given as a test: \u201cTo the law and to the\ntestimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because\nthere is no light in them.\u201d Why say, \u201cIf they speak not,\u201d if there\nwas to be no true spiritual manifestation or prophesying at the same\ntime? Jesus says, \u201cBeware of false prophets.... Ye shall know them\nby their fruits.\u201d Matthew 7:15, 16. This is a part of the Sermon on the\nMount, and all can see that this discourse has a general application\nto the church through the gospel age. False prophets are to be known\nby their fruits; in other words, by their moral character. The only\nstandard by which to determine whether their fruits are good or\nbad, is the law of God. Thus we are brought to the law and to the\ntestimony. True prophets will not only speak according to this word,\nbut they will live according to it. One who speaks and lives thus, I\ndare not condemn.\nIt has always been a characteristic of false prophets that they see[139]\nvisions of peace; and they will be saying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d when\nsudden destruction comes upon them. The true will boldly reprove\nsin and warn of coming wrath.\nProphesyings which contradict the plain and positive declarations\nof the Word, are to be rejected. Thus our Saviour taught His disciples\nwhen He warned them concerning the manner of His second coming.\nWhen Jesus ascended to heaven in the sight of His disciples, it was\ndeclared most explicitly by the angels that this same Jesus should so\nIntroduction 145\ncome in like manner as they had seen Him go into heaven. Hence\nJesus, in predicting the work of the false prophets of the last days,\nsays, \u201cIf they shall say unto you, behold, He is in the desert; go not\nforth: Behold, He is in the secret chambers, believe it not.\u201d All true\nprophesying on that point must recognize His visible coming from\nheaven. Why did not Jesus say, reject all prophesying at that time;\nfor there will be no true prophets then?\n\u201cAnd He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,\nevangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the\nsaints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of\nChrist: till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge\nof the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature\nof the fullness of Christ.\u201d Ephesians 4:11-13.\nWe learn from a previous verse that when Christ ascended up on\nhigh, He gave gifts unto men. Among these gifts are enumerated\napostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. The object\nfor which they were given was the perfecting of the saints in unity\nand knowledge. Some who profess to be pastors and teachers at\nthe present day hold that these gifts fully accomplished their object\nsome eighteen hundred years ago, and consequently ceased. Why [140]\nnot then throw aside their titles of pastors and teachers? If the office\nof prophet is by this text limited to the primitive church, so is that of\nthe evangelist\u2014and all the rest; for no distinction is made.\nNow let us reason a moment upon this point. All these gifts were\ngiven for the perfecting of the saints in unity, knowledge, and spirit.\nUnder their influence the primitive church for a time enjoyed that\nunity: \u201cThe multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of\none soul.\u201d And it seems a natural consequence of this state of unity,\nthat \u201cwith great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection\nof the Lord Jesus: And great grace was upon them all.\u201d Acts 4:31-\n33. How desirable such a state of things now! But apostasy with its\ndividing and blighting influence marred the beauty of the fair church\nand clothed her in sackcloth. Division and disorder have been the\nresult. Never was there so great a diversity of faith in Christendom\nas at the present day. If the gifts were necessary to preserve the unity\nof the primitive church, how much more so to restore unity now!\nAnd that it is the purpose of God to restore the unity of the church\nin the last days, is abundantly evident from the prophecies. We are\n146 Early Writings\nassured that the watchmen shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall\nbring again Zion. Also, that in the time of the end the wise shall\nunderstand. When this is fulfilled there will be unity of faith with\nall whom God accounts wise; for those that do in reality understand\naright, must necessarily understand alike. What is to effect this unity\nbut the gifts that were given for this very purpose?\nFrom considerations like these, it is evident that the perfect state\nof the church here predicted is still in the future; consequently these\ngifts have not yet accomplished their purpose. This letter to the\nEphesians was written in A.D. 64, about two years before Paul told[141]\nTimothy that he was ready to be offered, and the time of his departure\nwas at hand. The seeds of the apostasy were now germinating in\nthe church, for Paul had said ten years before, in his second letter\nto the Thessalonians, \u201cThe mystery of iniquity doth already work.\u201d\nGrievous wolves were now about to enter in, not sparing the flock.\nThe church was not then rising and advancing to that perfection in\nunity contemplated in the text, but was about to be torn by factions\nand distracted by divisions. The apostle knew this; consequently\nhe must have looked beyond the great apostasy, to the period of the\ngathering of the remnant of God\u2019s people, when he said, \u201cTill we all\ncome into [margin] the unity of the faith.\u201d Ephesians 4:13. Hence\nthe gifts that were set in the church have not yet served out their\ntime.\n\u201cQuench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings. Prove all\nthings; hold fast that which is good.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:19-21.\nIn this epistle the apostle introduces the subject of the second\ncoming of the Lord. He then describes the state of the unbelieving\nworld at that time, who are saying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d when the day\nof the Lord is about to burst upon them, and sudden destruction come\nupon them as a thief in the night. He then exhorts the church, in\nview of these things, to keep awake, to watch and be sober. Among\nthe exhortations that follow are the words we have quoted, \u201cQuench\nnot the Spirit,\u201d etc. Some may think that these three verses are\ncompletely detached from one another in sense; but they have a\nnatural connection in the order in which they stand. The person who\nquenches the Spirit will be left to despise prophesyings, which are\nthe legitimate fruit of the Spirit. \u201cI will pour out My Spirit upon\nall flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy.\u201d Joel[142]\nIntroduction 147\n2:28. The expression, \u201cProve all things,\u201d is limited to the subject\nof discourse, prophesyings, and we are to try the spirits by the tests\nwhich God has given us in His Word. Spiritual deceptions and false\nprophesyings abound at the present time; and doubtless this text has\na special application here. But mark, the apostle does not say, Reject\nall things; but, Prove all things; Hold fast that which is good.\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My\nSpirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall proph-\nesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see\nvisions; and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those\ndays will I pour out My Spirit. And I will show wonders in the\nheavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke. The\nsun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before\nthe great and the terrible day of the Lord come. And it shall come\nto pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be\ndelivered: For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance,\nas the Lord hath said, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.\u201d\nJoel 2:28-32.\nThis prophecy of Joel, which speaks of the outpouring of the\nHoly Spirit in the last days, was not all fulfilled at the beginning of\nthe gospel dispensation. This is evident from the wonders in heaven\nand in earth, introduced in this text, which were to be precursors\nof \u201cThe great and terrible day of the Lord.\u201d though we have had\nthe signs, that terrible day is still in the future. The whole gospel\ndispensation may be called the last days, but to say that the last days\nare all 1800 years in the past, is absurd. They reach to the day of the\nLord and to the deliverance of the remnant of God\u2019s people: \u201cFor in\nMount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the Lord hath\nsaid, and in the remnant whom the Lord shall call.\u201d\nThis remnant, existing amid the signs and wonders that usher [143]\nin the great and terrible day of the Lord, is doubtless the remnant\nof the seed of the woman spoken of in Revelation 12:17\u2014the last\ngeneration of the church on earth. \u201cAnd the dragon was wroth with\nthe woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed,\nwhich keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of\nJesus Christ.\u201d\nThe remnant of the gospel church will have the gifts. War will\nbe waged against them because they keep the commandments of\n148 Early Writings\nGod and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. (Revelation 12:17.) In\nRevelation 19:10, the testimony of Jesus is defined to be the spirit\nof prophecy. Said the angel, \u201cI am thy fellow servant, and of thy\nbrethren that have the testimony of Jesus.\u201d In Revelation 22:9, he\nrepeats the same in substance, as follows: \u201cI am thy fellow servant,\nand of thy brethren the prophets.\u201d From the comparison we see\nthe force of the expression, \u201cThe testimony of Jesus is the spirit of\nprophecy.\u201d But the testimony of Jesus includes all the gifts of that one\nSpirit. Says Paul: \u201cI thank my God always on your behalf, for the\ngrace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; that in everything\nye are enriched by Him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; even\nas the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: So that ye come\nbehind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 1:4-7. The testimony of Christ was confirmed in the\nCorinthian church; and what was the result? They came behind\nin no gift. Are we not justified, then, in the conclusion that when\nthe remnant are fully confirmed in the testimony of Jesus, they will\ncome behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus\nChrist?\nRoswell F. Cottrell\nThe Fall of Satan [144]\n[145]\nSatan was once an honored angel in heaven, next to Christ. His\ncountenance, like those of the other angels, was mild and expressive\nof happiness. His forehead was high and broad, showing great\nintelligence. His form was perfect; his bearing noble and majestic.\nBut when God said to His Son, \u201cLet us make man in our image,\u201d\nSatan was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concerning\nthe formation of man, and because he was not, he was filled with\nenvy, jealousy, and hatred. He desired to receive the highest honors\nin heaven next to God.\nUntil this time all heaven had been in order, harmony, and perfect\nsubjection to the government of God. It was the highest sin to rebel\nagainst His order and will. All heaven seemed in commotion. The\nangels were marshaled in companies, each division with a higher\ncommanding angel at its head. Satan, ambitious to exalt himself,\nand unwilling to submit to the authority of Jesus, was insinuating\nagainst the government of God. Some of the angels sympathized\nwith Satan in his rebellion, and others strongly contended for the\nhonor and wisdom of God in giving authority to His Son. There\nwas contention among the angels. Satan and his sympathizers were\nstriving to reform the government of God. They wished to look into\nHis unsearchable wisdom, and ascertain His purpose in exalting\nJesus and endowing Him with such unlimited power and command. [146]\nThey rebelled against the authority of the Son. All the heavenly\nhost were summoned to appear before the Father to have each case\ndecided. It was there determined that Satan should be expelled from\nheaven, with all the angels who had joined him in the rebellion. Then\nthere was war in heaven. Angels were engaged in the battle; Satan\nwished to conquer the Son of God and those who were submissive\nto His will. But the good and true angels prevailed, and Satan, with\nhis followers, was driven from heaven.\nAfter Satan and those who fell with him were shut out of heaven,\nand he realized that he had forever lost all its purity and glory, he\n149\n150 Early Writings\nrepented, and wished to be reinstated in heaven. He was willing to\ntake his proper place, or any position that might be assigned him.\nBut no; heaven must not be placed in jeopardy. All heaven might\nbe marred should he be taken back; for sin originated with him, and\nthe seeds of rebellion were within him. Both he and his followers\nwept, and implored to be taken back into the favor of God. But\ntheir sin\u2014their hatred, their envy and jealousy\u2014had been so great\nthat God could not blot it out. It must remain to receive its final\npunishment.\nWhen Satan became fully conscious that there was no possibility\nof his being brought again into favor with God, his malice and hatred\nbegan to be manifest. He consulted with his angels, and a plan\nwas laid to still work against God\u2019s government. When Adam and\nEve were placed in the beautiful garden, Satan was laying plans to\ndestroy them. In no way could this happy couple be deprived of their\nhappiness if they obeyed God. Satan could not exercise his power\nupon them unless they should first disobey God and forfeit His favor.\nSome plan must therefore be devised to lead them to disobedience\nthat they might incur God\u2019s frown and be brought under the more[147]\ndirect influence of Satan and his angels. It was decided that Satan\nshould assume another form and manifest an interest for man. He\nmust insinuate against God\u2019s truthfulness and create doubt whether\nGod did mean just what He said; next, he must excite their curiosity,\nand lead them to pry into the unsearchable plans of God\u2014the very\nsin of which Satan had been guilty\u2014and reason as to the cause of\nHis restrictions in regard to the tree of knowledge.\nThe Fall of Man\nHoly angels often visited the garden, and gave instruction to\nAdam and Eve concerning their employment and also taught them\nconcerning the rebellion and fall of Satan. The angels warned them\nof Satan and cautioned them not to separate from each other in\ntheir employment, for they might be brought in contact with this\nfallen foe. The angels also enjoined upon them to follow closely the\ndirections God had given them, for in perfect obedience only were\nthey safe. Then this fallen foe could have no power over them.\nSatan commenced his work with Eve, to cause her to disobey.\nShe first erred in wandering from her husband, next in lingering\naround the forbidden tree, and next in listening to the voice of the\ntempter, and even daring to doubt what God had said, \u201cIn the day that\nthou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\u201d She thought that perhaps\nthe Lord did not mean just what He said, and venturing, she put forth\nher hand, took of the fruit and ate. It was pleasing to the eye and\npleasant to the taste. Then she was jealous that God had withheld\nfrom them what was really for their good, and she offered the fruit [148]\nto her husband, thereby tempting him. She related to Adam all that\nthe serpent had said and expressed her astonishment that he had the\npower of speech.\nI saw a sadness come over Adam\u2019s countenance. He appeared\nafraid and astonished. A struggle seemed to be going on in his\nmind. He felt sure that this was the foe against whom they had been\nwarned, and that his wife must die. They must be separated. His\nlove for Eve was strong, and in utter discouragement he resolved\nto share her fate. He seized the fruit and quickly ate it. Then Satan\nexulted. He had rebelled in heaven, and had gained sympathizers\nwho loved him and followed him in his rebellion. He had fallen and\ncaused others to fall with him. And he had now tempted the woman\nto distrust God, to inquire into His wisdom, and to seek to penetrate\nHis all-wise plans. Satan knew that the woman would not fall alone.\n151\n152 Early Writings\nAdam, through his love for Eve, disobeyed the command of God,\nand fell with her.\nThe news of man\u2019s fall spread through heaven. Every harp was\nhushed. The angels cast their crowns from their heads in sorrow. All\nheaven was in agitation. A council was held to decide what must be\ndone with the guilty pair. The angels feared that they would put forth\nthe hand, and eat of the tree of life, and become immortal sinners.\nBut God said that He would drive the transgressors from the garden.\nAngels were immediately commissioned to guard the way of the tree\nof life. It had been Satan\u2019s studied plan that Adam and Eve should\ndisobey God, receive His frown, and then partake of the tree of life,\nthat they might live forever in sin and disobedience, and thus sin be\nimmortalized. But holy angels were sent to drive them out of the\ngarden, and to bar their way to the tree of life. Each of these mighty\nangels had in his right hand something which had the appearance of[149]\na glittering sword.\nThen Satan triumphed. He had made others suffer by his fall.\nHe had been shut out of heaven, they out of Paradise.\nThe Plan of Salvation\nSorrow filled heaven, as it was realized that man was lost, and\nthat world which God had created was to be filled with mortals\ndoomed to misery, sickness, and death, and there was no way of\nescape for the offender. The whole family of Adam must die. I saw\nthe lovely Jesus and beheld an expression of sympathy and sorrow\nupon His countenance. Soon I saw Him approach the exceeding\nbright light which enshrouded the Father. Said my accompanying\nangel, He is in close converse with His Father. The anxiety of the\nangels seemed to be intense while Jesus was communing with His\nFather. Three times He was shut in by the glorious light about the\nFather, and the third time He came from the Father, His person could\nbe seen. His countenance was calm, free from all perplexity and\ndoubt, and shone with benevolence and loveliness, such as words\ncannot express. He then made known to the angelic host that a way\nof escape had been made for lost man. He told them that He had\nbeen pleading with His Father, and had offered to give His life a\nransom, to take the sentence of death upon Himself, that through\nHim man might find pardon; that through the merits of His blood,\nand obedience to the law of God, they could have the favor of God,\nand be brought into the beautiful garden, and eat of the fruit of the\ntree of life.\nAt first the angels could not rejoice; for their Commander con-\ncealed nothing from them, but opened before them the plan of sal- [150]\nvation. Jesus told them that He would stand between the wrath of\nHis Father and guilty man, that He would bear iniquity and scorn,\nand but few would receive Him as the Son of God. Nearly all would\nhate and reject Him. He would leave all His glory in heaven, appear\nupon earth as a man, humble Himself as a man, become acquainted\nby His own experience with the various temptations with which man\nwould be beset, that He might know how to succor those who should\nbe tempted; and that finally, after His mission as a teacher would be\naccomplished, He would be delivered into the hands of men, and\n153\n154 Early Writings\nendure almost every cruelty and suffering that Satan and his angels\ncould inspire wicked men to inflict; that He would die the cruelest of\ndeaths, hung up between the heavens and the earth as a guilty sinner;\nthat He would suffer dreadful hours of agony, which even angels\ncould not look upon, but would veil their faces from the sight. Not\nmerely agony of body would He suffer, but mental agony, that with\nwhich bodily suffering could in no wise be compared. The weight\nof the sins of the whole world would be upon Him. He told them\nHe would die and rise again the third day, and would ascend to His\nFather to intercede for wayward, guilty man.\nThe angels prostrated themselves before Him. They offered their\nlives. Jesus said to them that He would by His death save many, that\nthe life of an angel could not pay the debt. His life alone could be\naccepted of His Father as a ransom for man. Jesus also told them\nthat they would have a part to act, to be with Him and at different\ntimes strengthen Him; that He would take man\u2019s fallen nature, and\nHis strength would not be even equal with theirs; that they would\nbe witnesses of His humiliation and great sufferings; and that as\nthey would witness His sufferings, and the hatred of men toward[151]\nHim, they would be stirred with the deepest emotion, and through\ntheir love for Him would wish to rescue and deliver Him from His\nmurderers; but that they must not interfere to prevent anything they\nshould behold; and that they should act a part in His resurrection;\nthat the plan of salvation was devised, and His Father had accepted\nthe plan.\nWith a holy sadness Jesus comforted and cheered the angels and\ninformed them that hereafter those whom He should redeem would\nbe with Him, and that by His death He should ransom many and\ndestroy him who had the power of death. And His Father would give\nHim the kingdom and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole\nheaven, and He would possess it forever and ever. Satan and sinners\nwould be destroyed, nevermore to disturb heaven or the purified new\nearth. Jesus bade the heavenly host be reconciled to the plan that His\nFather had accepted and rejoice that through His death fallen man\ncould again be exalted to obtain favor with God and enjoy heaven.\nThen joy, inexpressible joy, filled heaven. And the heavenly host\nsang a song of praise and adoration. They touched their harps and\nsang a note higher than they had done before, for the great mercy\nPlan of Salvation 155\nand condescension of God in yielding up His dearly Beloved to die\nfor a race of rebels. Praise and adoration were poured forth for the\nself-denial and sacrifice of Jesus; that He would consent to leave the\nbosom of His Father, and choose a life of suffering and anguish, and\ndie an ignominious death to give life to others.\nSaid the angel, \u201cThink ye that the Father yielded up His dearly\nbeloved Son without a struggle? No, no. It was even a struggle with\nthe God of heaven, whether to let guilty man perish, or to give His\nbeloved Son to die for him.\u201d Angels were so interested for man\u2019s\nsalvation that there could be found among them those who would [152]\nyield their glory and give their life for perishing man, \u201cBut,\u201d said my\naccompanying angel, \u201cthat would avail nothing. The transgression\nwas so great that an angel\u2019s life would not pay the debt. Nothing but\nthe death and intercessions of His son would pay the debt and save\nlost man from hopeless sorrow and misery.\u201d\nBut the work of the angels was assigned them, to ascend and\ndescend with strengthening balm from glory to soothe the Son of\nGod in His sufferings, and minister unto Him. Also, their work\nwould be to guard and keep the subjects of grace from the evil\nangels and the darkness constantly thrown around them by Satan.\nI saw that it was impossible for God to alter or change His law to\nsave lost, perishing man; therefore He suffered His beloved Son to\ndie for man\u2019s transgression.\nSatan again rejoiced with his angels that he could, by causing\nman\u2019s fall, pull down the Son of God from His exalted position. He\ntold his angels that when Jesus should take fallen man\u2019s nature, he\ncould overpower Him and hinder the accomplishment of the plan of\nsalvation.\nI was shown Satan as he once was, a happy, exalted angel. Then\nI was shown him as he now is. He still bears a kingly form. His\nfeatures are still noble, for he is an angel fallen. But the expression\nof his countenance is full of anxiety, care, unhappiness, malice, hate,\nmischief, deceit, and every evil. That brow which was once so noble,\nI particularly noticed. His forehead commenced from his eyes to\nrecede. I saw that he had so long bent himself to evil that every\ngood quality was debased, and every evil trait was developed. His\neyes were cunning, sly, and showed great penetration. His frame\nwas large, but the flesh hung loosely about his hands and face. As I [153]\n156 Early Writings\nbeheld him, his chin was resting upon his left hand. He appeared to\nbe in deep thought. A smile was upon his countenance, which made\nme tremble, it was so full of evil and satanic slyness. This smile is\nthe one he wears just before he makes sure of his victim, and as he\nfastens the victim in his snare, this smile grows horrible.\nThe First Advent Of Christ\nI was carried down to the time when Jesus was to take upon\nHimself man\u2019s nature, humble Himself as a man, and suffer the\ntemptations of Satan.\nHis birth was without worldly grandeur. He was born in a stable\nand cradled in a manger; yet His birth was honored far above that of\nany of the sons of men. Angels from heaven informed the shepherds\nof the advent of Jesus, and light and glory from God accompanied\ntheir testimony. The heavenly host touched their harps and glorified\nGod. They triumphantly heralded the advent of the Son of God to\na fallen world to accomplish the work of redemption, and by His\ndeath to bring peace, happiness, and everlasting life to man. God\nhonored the advent of His Son. Angels worshiped Him.\nAngels of God hovered over the scene of His baptism; the Holy\nSpirit descended in the form of a dove and lighted upon Him, and\nas the people stood greatly amazed, with their eyes fastened upon\nHim, the Father\u2019s voice was heard from heaven, saying, Thou art\nMy beloved Son; in Thee I am well pleased.\nJohn was not certain that it was the Saviour who came to be\nbaptized of him in Jordan. But God had promised him a sign by\nwhich he should know the Lamb of God. That sign was given as\nthe heavenly dove rested upon Jesus, and the glory of God shone\nround about Him. John reached forth his hand, pointing to Jesus, [154]\nand with a loud voice cried out, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world!\u201d\nJohn informed his disciples that Jesus was the promised Messiah,\nthe Saviour of the world. As his work was closing, he taught his\ndisciples to look to Jesus, and follow Him as the Great Teacher.\nJohn\u2019s life was sorrowful and self-denying. He heralded the first\nadvent of Christ, but was not permitted to witness His miracles, and\nenjoy the power manifested by Him. When Jesus should establish\nHimself as a teacher, John knew that he himself must die. His voice\nwas seldom heard, except in the wilderness. His life was lonely.\n157\n158 Early Writings\nHe did not cling to his father\u2019s family, to enjoy their society, but\nleft them in order to fulfill his mission. Multitudes left the busy\ncities and villages and flocked to the wilderness to hear the words of\nthe wonderful prophet. John laid the ax to the root of the tree. He\nreproved sin, fearless of consequences, and prepared the way for the\nLamb of God.\nHerod was affected as he listened to the powerful, pointed tes-\ntimonies of John, and with deep interest he inquired what he must\ndo to become his disciple. John was acquainted with the fact that he\nwas about to marry his brother\u2019s wife, while her husband was yet\nliving, and faithfully told Herod that this was not lawful. Herod was\nunwilling to make any sacrifice. He married his brother\u2019s wife, and\nthrough her influence, seized John and put him in prison, intending\nhowever to release him. While there confined, John heard through\nhis disciples of the mighty works of Jesus. He could not listen to\nHis gracious words; but the disciples informed him and comforted\nhim with what they had heard. Soon John was beheaded, through\nthe influence of Herod\u2019s wife. I saw that the humblest disciples who[155]\nfollowed Jesus, witnessed His miracles, and heard the comforting\nwords which fell from His lips, were greater than John the Baptist;\nthat is, they were more exalted and honored, and had more pleasure\nin their lives.\nJohn came in the spirit and power of Elijah to proclaim the first\nadvent of Jesus. I was pointed down to the last days and saw that\nJohn represented those who should go forth in the spirit and power\nof Elijah to herald the day of wrath and the second advent of Jesus.\nAfter the baptism of Jesus in Jordan, He was led by the Spirit\ninto the wilderness, to be tempted of the devil. The Holy Spirit\nhad prepared Him for that special scene of fierce temptations. Forty\ndays He was tempted of Satan, and in those days He ate nothing.\nEverything around Him was unpleasant, from which human nature\nwould be led to shrink. He was with the wild beasts and the devil, in\na desolate, lonely place. The Son of God was pale and emaciated,\nthrough fasting and suffering. But His course was marked out, and\nHe must fulfill the work which He came to do.\nSatan took advantage of the sufferings of the Son of God and\nprepared to beset Him with manifold temptations, hoping to obtain\nthe victory over Him, because He had humbled Himself as a man.\nFirst Advent Of Christ 159\nSatan came with this temptation: \u201cIf Thou be the Son of God,\ncommand this stone that it be made bread.\u201d He tempted Jesus to\ncondescend to give him proof of His being the Messiah, by exercising\nHis divine power. Jesus mildly answered him, \u201cIt is written, That\nman shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\u201d\nSatan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning His being\nthe Son of God. He referred to His weak, suffering condition and [156]\nboastingly affirmed that he was stronger than Jesus. But the word\nspoken from heaven, \u201cThou art My beloved Son; in Thee I am well\npleased,\u201d was sufficient to sustain Jesus through all His sufferings.\nI saw that Christ had nothing to do in convincing Satan of His\npower or of His being the Saviour of the world. Satan had sufficient\nevidence of the exalted station and authority of the Son of God.\nHis unwillingness to yield to Christ\u2019s authority had shut him out of\nheaven.\nSatan, to manifest his power, carried Jesus to Jerusalem, and\nset Him upon a pinnacle of the temple, and there tempted Him to\ngive evidence that He was the Son of God, by casting Himself down\nfrom that dizzy height. Satan came with the words of inspiration:\n\u201cFor it is written, He shall give His angels charge over Thee, to keep\nThee: and in their hands they shall bear Thee up, lest at any time\nThou dash Thy foot against a stone.\u201d Jesus answering said unto him,\n\u201cIt is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.\u201d Satan wished\nto cause Jesus to presume upon the mercy of His Father and risk\nHis life before the fulfillment of His mission. He had hoped that the\nplan of salvation would fail; but the plan was laid too deep to be\noverthrown or marred by Satan.\nChrist is the example for all Christians. When they are tempted,\nor their rights are disputed, they should bear it patiently. They should\nnot feel that they have a right to call upon the Lord to display His\npower that they may obtain a victory over their enemies, unless\nGod can be directly honored and glorified thereby. If Jesus had cast\nHimself from the pinnacle of the temple, it would not have glorified\nHis Father; for none would have witnessed the act but Satan and the\nangels of God. And it would have been tempting the Lord to display\nHis power to His bitterest foe. It would have been condescending to [157]\nthe one whom Jesus came to conquer.\n160 Early Writings\n\u201cAnd the devil, taking Him up into an high mountain, showed\nunto Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And\nthe devil said unto Him, All this power will I give Thee, and the\nglory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I\nwill I give it. If Thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be Thine.\nAnd Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind Me, Satan:\nfor it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only\nshalt thou serve.\u201d\nSatan presented before Jesus the kingdoms of the world in the\nmost attractive light. If Jesus would there worship him, he offered\nto relinquish his claims to the possessions of earth. If the plan of\nsalvation should be carried out, and Jesus should die to redeem\nman, Satan knew that his own power must be limited and finally\ntaken away, and that he would be destroyed. Therefore it was his\nstudied plan to prevent, if possible, the completion of the great work\nwhich had been commenced by the Son of God. If the plan of man\u2019s\nredemption should fail, Satan would retain the kingdom which he\nthen claimed. And if he should succeed, he flattered himself that he\nwould reign in opposition to the God of heaven.\nSatan exulted when Jesus laid aside His power and glory and\nleft heaven. He thought that the Son of God was then placed in his\npower. The temptation took so easily with the holy pair in Eden that\nhe hoped by his satanic power and cunning to overthrow even the\nSon of God, and thereby save his own life and kingdom. If he could\ntempt Jesus to depart from the will of His Father, his object would be\ngained. But Jesus met the tempter with the rebuke, \u201cGet thee behind\nMe, Satan.\u201d He was to bow only to His Father. Satan claimed the[158]\nkingdom of earth as his and insinuated to Jesus that all His sufferings\nmight be saved: that He need not die to obtain the kingdoms of this\nworld; if He would worship him He might have all the possessions\nof earth and the glory of reigning over them. But Jesus was steadfast.\nHe knew that the time was to come when He would by His own\nlife redeem the kingdom from Satan, and that, after a season, all\nin heaven and earth would submit to Him. He chose His life of\nsuffering and His dreadful death, as the way appointed by His Father\nthat He might become a lawful heir to the kingdoms of earth and\nhave them given into His hands as an everlasting possession. Satan\nFirst Advent Of Christ 161\nalso will be given into His hands to be destroyed by death, nevermore\nto annoy Jesus or the saints in glory.\nThe Ministry of Christ\nAfter Satan had ended his temptations, he departed from Jesus\nfor a season, and angels prepared Him food in the wilderness, and\nstrengthened Him, and the blessing of His Father rested upon Him.\nSatan had failed in his fiercest temptations; yet he looked forward to\nthe period of Jesus\u2019 ministry, when he should at different times try\nhis cunning against Him. He still hoped to prevail against Him by\nstirring up those who would not receive Jesus, to hate and seek to\ndestroy Him. Satan held a special council with his angels. They were\ndisappointed and enraged that they had prevailed nothing against\nthe Son of God. They decided that they must be more cunning and\nuse their power to the utmost to inspire unbelief in the minds of\nHis own nation as to His being the Saviour of the world, and in this\nway discourage Jesus in His mission. No matter how exact the Jews\nmight be in their ceremonies and sacrifices, if they could be kept[159]\nblinded as to the prophecies and be made to believe that the Messiah\nwas to appear as a mighty worldly king, they might be led to despise\nand reject Jesus.\nI was shown that Satan and his angels were very busy during\nChrist\u2019s ministry, inspiring men with unbelief, hate, and scorn. Often\nwhen Jesus uttered some cutting truth, reproving their sins, the\npeople would become enraged. Satan and his angels urged them\non to take the life of the Son of God. More than once they took up\nstones to cast at Him, but angels guarded Him and bore Him away\nfrom the angry multitude to a place of safety. Again, as the plain\ntruth dropped from His holy lips, the multitude laid hold of Him\nand led Him to the brow of a hill, intending to cast Him down. A\ncontention arose among themselves as to what they should do with\nHim, when the angels again hid Him from the sight of the multitude,\nand He, passing through the midst of them, went His way.\nSatan still hoped that the great plan of salvation would fail. He\nexerted all his power to make the hearts of the people hard and their\nfeelings bitter against Jesus. He hoped that so few would receive\n162\nMinistry of Christ 163\nHim as the Son of God that He would consider His sufferings and\nsacrifice too great to make for so small a company. But I saw that if\nthere had been but two who would have accepted Jesus as the Son\nof God and believed on Him to the saving of their souls, He would\nhave carried out the plan.\nJesus began His work by breaking Satan\u2019s power over the suf-\nfering. He restored the sick to health, gave sight to the blind, and\nhealed the lame, causing them to leap for joy and to glorify God. He\nrestored to health those who had been infirm and bound by Satan\u2019s\ncruel power many years. With gracious words He comforted the [160]\nweak, the trembling, and the desponding. The feeble, suffering\nones whom Satan held in triumph, Jesus wrenched from his grasp,\nbringing to them soundness of body and great joy and happiness. He\nraised the dead to life, and they glorified God for the mighty display\nof His power. He wrought mightily for all who believed on Him.\nThe life of Christ was filled with words and acts of benevolence,\nsympathy, and love. He was ever attentive to listen to and relieve\nthe woes of those who came to Him. Multitudes carried in their own\npersons the evidence of His divine power. Yet after the work had\nbeen accomplished, many were ashamed of the humble yet mighty\nteacher. Because the rulers did not believe on Him, the people\nwere not willing to accept Jesus. He was a man of sorrows and\nacquainted with grief. They could not endure to be governed by His\nsober, self-denying life. They wished to enjoy the honor which the\nworld bestows. Yet many followed the Son of God and listened to\nHis instructions, feasting upon the words which fell so graciously\nfrom His lips. His words were full of meaning, yet so plain that the\nweakest could understand them.\nSatan and his angels blinded the eyes and darkened the under-\nstanding of the Jews, and stirred up the chief of the people and the\nrulers to take the Saviour\u2019s life. Others were sent to bring Jesus\nunto them; but as they came near where He was they were greatly\namazed. They saw Him filled with sympathy and compassion, as He\nwitnessed human woe. They heard Him in love and tenderness speak\nencouragingly to the weak and afflicted. They also heard Him, in a\nvoice of authority, rebuke the power of Satan and bid his captives go\nfree. They listened to the words of wisdom that fell from His lips,\nand they were captivated; they could not lay hands on Him. They\n164 Early Writings\nreturned to the priests and elders without Jesus. When asked, \u201cWhy[161]\nhave ye not brought Him?\u201d they related what they had witnessed of\nHis miracles, and the holy words of wisdom, love, and knowledge\nwhich they had heard, and ended with saying, \u201cNever man spake like\nthis man.\u201d The chief priests accused them of being also deceived,\nand some of the officers were ashamed that they had not taken Him.\nThe priests inquired in a scornful manner if any of the rulers had\nbelieved on Him. I saw that many of the magistrates and elders did\nbelieve on Jesus; but Satan kept them from acknowledging it; they\nfeared the reproach of the people more than they feared God.\nThus far the cunning and hatred of Satan had not broken up the\nplan of salvation. The time for the accomplishment of the object\nfor which Jesus came into the world was drawing near. Satan and\nhis angels consulted together and decided to inspire Christ\u2019s own\nnation to cry eagerly for His blood and heap upon Him cruelty and\nscorn. They hoped that Jesus would resent such treatment and fail\nto maintain His humility and meekness.\nWhile Satan was laying his plans, Jesus was carefully opening\nto His disciples the sufferings through which He must pass\u2014that He\nwould be crucified and that He would rise again the third day. But\ntheir understanding seemed dull, and they could not comprehend\nwhat He told them.\nThe Transfiguration [162]\nThe faith of the disciples was greatly strengthened at the trans-\nfiguration, when they were permitted to behold Christ\u2019s glory and to\nhear the voice from heaven testifying to His divine character. God\nchose to give the followers of Jesus strong proof that He was the\npromised Messiah, that in their bitter sorrow and disappointment at\nHis crucifixion, they would not entirely cast away their confidence.\nAt the transfiguration the Lord sent Moses and Elijah to talk with\nJesus concerning His sufferings and death. Instead of choosing an-\ngels to converse with His Son, God chose those who had themselves\nexperienced the trials of earth.\nElijah had walked with God. His work had been painful and\ntrying, for the Lord through him had reproved the sins of Israel.\nElijah was a prophet of God; yet he was compelled to flee from\nplace to place to save his life. His own nation hunted him like a\nwild beast that they might destroy him. But God translated Elijah.\nAngels bore him in glory and triumph to heaven.\nMoses was greater than any who had lived before him. He had\nbeen highly honored of God, being privileged to talk with the Lord\nface to face, as a man speaks with a friend. He was permitted to see\nthe bright light and excellent glory that enshrouded the Father. The\nLord through Moses delivered the children of Israel from Egyptian\nbondage. Moses was a mediator for his people, often standing\nbetween them and the wrath of God. When the anger of the Lord was\ngreatly kindled against Israel for their unbelief, their murmurings,\nand their grievous sins, Moses\u2019 love for them was tested. God\nproposed to destroy them and to make of him a mighty nation. [163]\nMoses showed his love for Israel by his earnest pleading in their\nbehalf. In his distress he prayed God to turn from His fierce anger\nand forgive Israel, or blot his name out of His book.\nWhen Israel murmured against God and against Moses because\nthey could get no water, they accused him of leading them out to\nkill them and their children. God heard their murmurings and bade\n165\n166 Early Writings\nMoses speak to the rock, that the people might have water. Moses\nsmote the rock in wrath and took the glory to himself. The continual\nwaywardness and murmuring of the children of Israel had caused\nhim the keenest sorrow, and for a little time he forgot how much the\nLord had borne with them, and that their murmuring was not against\nhim, but against God. He thought only of himself, how deeply he\nwas wronged, and how little gratitude they manifested in return for\nhis deep love for them.\nIt was God\u2019s plan to bring often His people into strait places,\nand then in their necessity to deliver them by His power, that they\nmight realize His love and care for them, and thus be led to serve\nand honor Him. But Moses had failed to honor God and magnify\nHis name before the people that they might glorify Him. In this he\nbrought upon himself the Lord\u2019s displeasure.\nWhen Moses came down from the mount with the two tables\nof stone and saw Israel worshiping the golden calf, his anger was\ngreatly kindled, and he threw down the tables of stone and broke\nthem. I saw that Moses did not sin in this. He was wroth for God,\njealous for His glory. But when he yielded to the natural feelings of\nhis heart and took to himself the honor which was due to God, he\nsinned, and for that sin God would not suffer him to enter the land\nof Canaan.\nSatan had been trying to find something wherewith to accuse[164]\nMoses before the angels. He exulted at his success in leading him\nto displease God, and he told the angels that he could overcome the\nSaviour of the world when He should come to redeem man. For his\ntransgression, Moses came under the power of Satan\u2014the dominion\nof death. Had he remained steadfast, the Lord would have brought\nhim to the Promised Land, and would then have translated him to\nheaven without his seeing death.\nMoses passed through death, but Michael came down and gave\nhim life before his body had seen corruption. Satan tried to hold the\nbody, claiming it as his; but Michael resurrected Moses and took\nhim to heaven. Satan railed bitterly against God, denouncing Him\nas unjust in permitting his prey to be taken from him; but Christ did\nnot rebuke His adversary, though it was through his temptation that\nthe servant of God had fallen. He meekly referred him to His Father,\nsaying, \u201cThe Lord rebuke thee.\u201d\nTransfiguration 167\nJesus had told His disciples that there were some standing with\nHim who should not taste of death till they should see the kingdom\nof God come with power. At the transfiguration this promise was\nfulfilled. The countenance of Jesus was there changed and shone\nlike the sun. His raiment was white and glistening. Moses was\npresent to represent those who will be raised from the dead at the\nsecond appearing of Jesus. And Elijah, who was translated without\nseeing death, represented those who will be changed to immortality\nat Christ\u2019s second coming and will be translated to heaven without\nseeing death. The disciples beheld with astonishment and fear the\nexcellent majesty of Jesus and the cloud that overshadowed them,\nand heard the voice of God in terrible majesty, saying, \u201cThis is My\nbeloved Son; hear Him.\u201d\nThe Betrayal of Christ[165]\nI was carried down to the time when Jesus ate the Passover\nsupper with His disciples. Satan had deceived Judas and led him\nto think that he was one of Christ\u2019s true disciples; but his heart\nhad ever been carnal. He had seen the mighty works of Jesus, he\nhad been with Him through His ministry, and had yielded to the\noverpowering evidence that He was the Messiah; but Judas was\nclose and covetous; he loved money. He complained in anger of the\ncostly ointment poured upon Jesus. Mary loved her Lord. He had\nforgiven her sins, which were many, and had raised from the dead\nher much-loved brother, and she felt that nothing was too dear to\nbestow upon Jesus. The more precious the ointment, the better could\nshe express her gratitude to her Saviour by devoting it to Him. Judas,\nas an excuse for his covetousness, urged that the ointment might\nhave been sold and given to the poor. But it was not because he had\nany care for the poor; for he was selfish, and often appropriated to\nhis own use that which was entrusted to his care to be given unto\nthe poor. Judas had been inattentive to the comfort and even to the\nwants of Jesus, and to excuse his covetousness he often referred to\nthe poor. This act of generosity on the part of Mary was a most\ncutting rebuke of his covetous disposition. The way was prepared\nfor Satan\u2019s temptation to find a ready reception in the heart of Judas.\nThe priests and rulers of the Jews hated Jesus; but multitudes\nthronged to listen to His words of wisdom and to witness His mighty\nworks. The people were stirred with the deepest interest and anx-\niously followed Jesus to hear the instructions of this wonderful\nteacher. Many of the rulers believed on Him, but dared not confess[166]\ntheir faith lest they should be put out of the synagogue. The priests\nand elders decided that something must be done to draw the attention\nof the people from Jesus. They feared that all men would believe\non Him. They could see no safety for themselves. They must lose\ntheir position or put Jesus to death. And after they should put Him to\ndeath, there would still be those who were living monuments of His\n168\nBetrayal of Christ 169\npower. Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead, and they feared that\nif they should kill Jesus, Lazarus would testify of His mighty power.\nThe people were flocking to see him who was raised from the dead,\nand the rulers determined to slay Lazarus also, and put down the\nexcitement. Then they would turn the people to the traditions and\ndoctrines of men, to tithe mint and rue, and again have influence\nover them. They agreed to take Jesus when He was alone; for if\nthey should attempt to take Him in a crowd, when the minds of the\npeople were all interested in Him, they would be stoned.\nJudas knew how anxious they were to obtain Jesus and offered to\nbetray Him to the chief priests and elders for a few pieces of silver.\nHis love of money led him to agree to betray his Lord into the hands\nof His bitterest enemies. Satan was working directly through Judas,\nand in the midst of the impressive scene of the last supper, the traitor\nwas devising plans to betray his Master. Jesus sorrowfully told His\ndisciples that all of them would be offended because of Him that\nnight. But Peter ardently affirmed that although all others should\nbe offended because of Him, he would not be offended. Jesus said\nto Peter: \u201cSatan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as\nwheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when\nthou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\u201d Luke 22:31, 32.\nI beheld Jesus in the garden with His disciples. In deep sorrow [167]\nHe bade them watch and pray, lest they should enter into temptation.\nHe knew that their faith was to be tried, and their hopes disappointed,\nand that they would need all the strength which they could obtain by\nclose watching and fervent prayer. With strong cries and weeping,\nJesus prayed, \u201cFather, if Thou be willing, remove this cup from\nMe: nevertheless not My will, but Thine, be done.\u201d The Son of God\nprayed in agony. Great drops of blood gathered upon His face and\nfell to the ground. Angels were hovering over the place, witnessing\nthe scene, but only one was commissioned to go and strengthen the\nSon of God in His agony. There was no joy in heaven. The angels\ncast their crowns and harps from them and with the deepest interest\nsilently watched Jesus. They wished to surround the Son of God,\nbut the commanding angels suffered them not, lest, as they should\nbehold His betrayal, they should deliver Him; for the plan had been\nlaid, and it must be fulfilled.\n170 Early Writings\nAfter Jesus had prayed, He came to His disciples; but they were\nsleeping. In that dreadful hour He had not the sympathy and prayers\nof even His disciples. Peter, who was so zealous a short time before,\nwas heavy with sleep. Jesus reminded him of his positive declara-\ntions and said to him, \u201cWhat, could ye not watch with Me one hour?\u201d\nThree times the Son of God prayed in agony. Then Judas, with his\nband of armed men, appeared. He approached his Master as usual,\nto salute Him. The band surrounded Jesus; but there He manifested\nHis divine power, as He said, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d \u201cI am He.\u201d They\nfell backward to the ground. Jesus made this inquiry that they might\nwitness His power and have evidence that He could deliver Himself\nfrom their hands if He would.\nThe disciples began to hope as they saw the multitude with[168]\ntheir staves and swords fall so quickly. As they arose and again\nsurrounded the Son of God, Peter drew his sword and smote a servant\nof the high priest and cut off an ear. Jesus bade him to put up the\nsword, saying, \u201cThinkest thou that I cannot now pray to My Father,\nand He shall presently give Me more than twelve legions of angels?\u201d\nI saw that as these words were spoken, the countenances of the\nangels were animated with hope. They wished then and there to\nsurround their Commander and disperse that angry mob. But again\nsadness settled upon them, as Jesus added, \u201cBut how then shall\nthe Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?\u201d The hearts of the\ndisciples also sank in despair and bitter disappointment, as Jesus\nsuffered Himself to be led away by His enemies.\nThe disciples feared for their own lives, and they all forsook Him\nand fled. Jesus was left alone in the hands of the murderous mob.\nOh, what a triumph of Satan then! And what sadness and sorrow\nwith the angels of God! Many companies of holy angels, each with a\ntall commanding angel at their head, were sent to witness the scene.\nThey were to record every insult and cruelty imposed upon the Son\nof God, and to register every pang of anguish which Jesus should\nsuffer; for the very men who joined in this dreadful scene are to see\nit all again in living characters.\nThe Trial of Christ [169]\nThe angels as they left heaven, in sadness laid off their glittering\ncrowns. They could not wear them while their Commander was suf-\nfering and was to wear a crown of thorns. Satan and his angels were\nbusy in the judgment hall to destroy human feeling and sympathy.\nThe very atmosphere was heavy and polluted by their influence. The\nchief priests and elders were inspired by them to insult and abuse\nJesus in a manner the most difficult for human nature to bear. Satan\nhoped that such mockery and violence would call forth from the Son\nof God some complaint or murmur; or that He would manifest His\ndivine power, and wrench Himself from the grasp of the multitude,\nand that thus the plan of salvation might at last fail.\nPeter followed his Lord after His betrayal. He was anxious to see\nwhat would be done with Jesus. But when he was accused of being\none of His disciples, fear for his own safety led him to declare that\nhe knew not the man. The disciples were noted for the purity of their\nlanguage, and Peter, to convince his accusers that he was not one\nof Christ\u2019s disciples, denied the charge the third time with cursing\nand swearing. Jesus, who was at some distance from Peter, turned a\nsorrowful reproving gaze upon him. Then the disciple remembered\nthe words which Jesus had spoken to him in the upper chamber, and\nalso his own zealous assertion, \u201cThough all men shall be offended\nbecause of Thee, yet will I never be offended.\u201d He had denied his\nLord, even with cursing and swearing; but that look of Jesus\u2019 melted\nPeter\u2019s heart and saved him. He wept bitterly and repented of his\ngreat sin, and was converted, and then was prepared to strengthen [170]\nhis brethren.\nThe multitude were clamorous for the blood of Jesus. They\ncruelly scourged Him, and put upon Him an old purple kingly robe,\nand bound His sacred head with a crown of thorns. They put a\nreed into His hand, and bowed to Him, and mockingly saluted Him,\n\u201cHail, king of the Jews!\u201d They then took the reed from His hand and\n171\n172 Early Writings\nsmote Him with it upon the head, causing the thorns to penetrate\nHis temples, sending the blood trickling down His face and beard.\nIt was difficult for the angels to endure the sight. They would\nhave delivered Jesus, but the commanding angels forbade them,\nsaying that it was a great ransom which was to be paid for man;\nbut it would be complete and would cause the death of him who\nhad the power of death. Jesus knew that angels were witnessing the\nscene of His humiliation. The weakest angel could have caused that\nmocking throng to fall powerless and could have delivered Jesus. He\nknew that if He should desire it of His Father, angels would instantly\nrelease Him. But it was necessary that He should suffer the violence\nof wicked men, in order to carry out the plan of salvation.\nJesus stood meek and humble before the infuriated multitude,\nwhile they offered Him the vilest abuse. They spit in His face\u2014that\nface from which they will one day desire to hide, which will give\nlight to the city of God and shine brighter than the sun. Christ did\nnot cast upon the offenders an angry look. They covered His head\nwith an old garment, blindfolding Him, and then struck Him in the\nface and cried out, \u201cProphesy, who is it that smote Thee?\u201d There\nwas commotion among the angels. They would have rescued Him\ninstantly; but their commanding angels restrained them.\nSome of the disciples had gained confidence to enter where Jesus[171]\nwas and witness His trial. They expected that He would manifest His\ndivine power, and deliver Himself from the hands of His enemies,\nand punish them for their cruelty toward Him. Their hopes would\nrise and fall as the different scenes transpired. Sometimes they\ndoubted, and feared that they had been deceived. But the voice heard\nat the mount of transfiguration, and the glory they there beheld,\nstrengthened their faith that He was the Son of God. They called\nto mind the scenes which they had witnessed, the miracles which\nthey had seen Jesus perform in healing the sick, opening the eyes of\nthe blind, unstopping the deaf ears, rebuking and casting out devils,\nraising the dead to life, and even calming the wind and the sea. They\ncould not believe that He would die. They hoped that He would\nyet rise in power, and with His commanding voice disperse that\nbloodthirsty multitude, as when He entered the temple and drove out\nthose who were making the house of God a place of merchandise,\nwhen they fled before Him as if pursued by a company of armed\nTrial of Christ 173\nsoldiers. The disciples hoped that Jesus would manifest His power\nand convince all that He was the King of Israel.\nJudas was filled with bitter remorse and shame at his treacherous\nact in betraying Jesus. And when he witnessed the abuse which\nthe Saviour endured, he was overcome. He had loved Jesus, but\nhad loved money more. He had not thought that Jesus would suffer\nHimself to be taken by the mob which he led on. He had expected\nHim to work a miracle, and deliver Himself from them. But when\nhe saw the infuriated multitude in the judgment hall, thirsting for\nblood, he deeply felt his guilt; and while many were vehemently\naccusing Jesus, Judas rushed through the multitude, confessing that\nhe had sinned in betraying innocent blood. He offered the priests [172]\nthe money which they had paid him, and entreated them to release\nJesus, declaring that He was entirely innocent.\nFor a short time vexation and confusion kept the priests silent.\nThey did not wish the people to know that they had hired one of the\nprofessed followers of Jesus to betray Him into their hands. Their\nhunting Jesus like a thief and taking Him secretly, they wished to\nhide. But the confession of Judas, and his haggard, guilty appear-\nance, exposed the priests before the multitude, showing that it was\nhatred that had caused them to take Jesus. As Judas loudly declared\nJesus to be innocent, the priests replied, \u201cWhat is that to us? see\nthou to that.\u201d They had Jesus in their power, and were determined\nto make sure of Him. Judas, overwhelmed with anguish, threw the\nmoney that he now despised at the feet of those who had hired him,\nand, in anguish and horror, went and hanged himself.\nJesus had many sympathizers in the company about Him, and\nHis answering nothing to the many questions put to Him amazed\nthe throng. Under all the mockery and violence of the mob, not\na frown, not a troubled expression, rested upon His features. He\nwas dignified and composed. The spectators looked upon Him with\nwonder. They compared His perfect form and firm, dignified bearing\nwith the appearance of those who sat in judgment against Him, and\nsaid to one another that He appeared more like a king than any of\nthe rulers. He bore no marks of being a criminal. His eye was mild,\nclear, and undaunted, His forehead broad and high. Every feature\nwas strongly marked with benevolence and noble principle. His\npatience and forbearance were so unlike man that many trembled.\n174 Early Writings\nEven Herod and Pilate were greatly troubled at His noble, Godlike\nbearing.\nFrom the first, Pilate was convicted that Jesus was no common[173]\nman. He believed Him to be an excellent character, and entirely\ninnocent of the charges brought against Him. The angels who were\nwitnessing the scene marked the convictions of the Roman governor,\nand to save him from engaging in the awful act of delivering Christ\nto be crucified, an angel was sent to Pilate\u2019s wife, and gave her\ninformation through a dream that it was the Son of God in whose trial\nher husband was engaged, and that He was an innocent sufferer. She\nimmediately sent a message to Pilate, stating that she had suffered\nmany things in a dream on account of Jesus and warning him to have\nnothing to do with that holy man. The messenger, pressing hastily\nthrough the crowd, placed the letter in the hands of Pilate. As he\nread, he trembled and turned pale, and at once determined to have\nnothing to do with putting Christ to death. If the Jews would have\nthe blood of Jesus, he would not give his influence to it, but would\nlabor to deliver Him.\nWhen Pilate heard that Herod was in Jerusalem, he was greatly\nrelieved; for he hoped to free himself from all responsibility in the\ntrial and condemnation of Jesus. He at once sent Him, with His\naccusers, to Herod. This ruler had become hardened in sin. The\nmurder of John the Baptist had left upon his conscience a stain\nfrom which he could not free himself. When he heard of Jesus\nand the mighty works wrought by Him, he feared and trembled,\nbelieving Him to be John the Baptist risen from the dead. When\nJesus was placed in his hands by Pilate, Herod considered the act an\nacknowledgment of his power, authority, and judgment. This had\nthe effect to make friends of the two rulers, who had before been\nenemies. Herod was pleased to see Jesus, expecting Him to work\nsome mighty miracle for his satisfaction. But it was not the work[174]\nof Jesus to gratify curiosity or to seek His own safety. His divine,\nmiraculous power was to be exercised for the salvation of others, but\nnot in His own behalf.\nJesus answered nothing to the many questions put to Him by\nHerod; neither did He reply to His enemies, who were vehemently\naccusing Him. Herod was enraged because Jesus did not appear\nto fear his power, and with his men of war he derided, mocked,\nTrial of Christ 175\nand abused the Son of God. Yet he was astonished at the noble,\nGodlike appearance of Jesus when shamefully abused, and fearing\nto condemn Him, he sent Him again to Pilate.\nSatan and his angels were tempting Pilate and trying to lead him\non to his own ruin. They suggested to him that if he did not take part\nin condemning Jesus others would; the multitude were thirsting for\nHis blood; and if he did not deliver Him to be crucified, he would lose\nhis power and worldly honor and would be denounced as a believer\non the impostor. Through fear of losing his power and authority,\nPilate consented to the death of Jesus. And notwithstanding he\nplaced the blood of Jesus upon His accusers, and the multitude\nreceived it, crying, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children,\u201d yet\nPilate was not clear; he was guilty of the blood of Christ. For his\nown selfish interest, his love of honor from the great men of earth,\nhe delivered an innocent man to die. If Pilate had followed his own\nconvictions, he would have had nothing to do with condemning\nJesus.\nThe appearance and words of Jesus during His trial made a\ndeep impression upon the minds of many who were present on that\noccasion. The result of the influence thus exerted was apparent after\nHis resurrection. Among those who were then added to the church,\nthere were many whose conviction dated from the time of Jesus\u2019\ntrial.\nSatan\u2019s rage was great as he saw that all the cruelty which he [175]\nhad led the Jews to inflict on Jesus had not called forth from Him\nthe slightest murmur. Although He had taken upon Himself man\u2019s\nnature, He was sustained by a Godlike fortitude, and departed not in\nthe least from the will of His Father.\nThe Crucifixion of Christ\nThe Son of God was delivered to the people to be crucified; with\nshouts of triumph they led the dear Saviour away. He was weak and\nfaint from weariness, pain, and loss of blood by the scourging and\nblows which He had received; yet the heavy cross upon which He\nwas soon to be nailed was laid upon Him. Jesus fainted beneath\nthe burden. Three times the cross was placed upon His shoulders,\nand three times He fainted. One of His followers, a man who had\nnot openly professed faith in Christ, yet believed on Him, was next\nseized. Upon him the cross was laid, and he bore it to the fatal spot.\nCompanies of angels were marshaled in the air above the place. A\nnumber of Christ\u2019s disciples followed Him to Calvary, in sorrow,\nand with bitter weeping. They called to mind His triumphal ride\ninto Jerusalem but a few days before, when they had followed Him,\ncrying, \u201cHosanna in the highest!\u201d and strewing their garments and\nthe beautiful palm branches in the way. They had thought that He\nwas then to take the kingdom and reign a temporal prince over Israel.\nHow changed the scene! How blighted their prospects! Not with\nrejoicing, not with cheerful hopes, but with hearts stricken with fear\nand despair they now slowly, sadly followed Him who had been\ndisgraced and humbled, and who was about to die.\nThe mother of Jesus was there. Her heart was pierced with an-[176]\nguish such as none but a fond mother can feel; yet, with the disciples,\nshe still hoped that Christ would work some mighty miracle and de-\nliver Himself from His murderers. She could not endure the thought\nthat He would suffer Himself to be crucified. But the preparations\nwere made, and Jesus was laid upon the cross. The hammer and\nthe nails were brought. The hearts of the disciples fainted within\nthem. The mother of Jesus was bowed with agony almost beyond\nendurance. Before the Saviour was nailed to the cross, the disciples\nbore her from the scene, that she might not hear the crashing of\nthe spikes as they were driven through the bone and muscle of His\ntender hands and feet. Jesus murmured not, but groaned in agony.\n176\nCrucifixion of Christ 177\nHis face was pale, and large drops of sweat stood upon His brow.\nSatan exulted in the suffering through which the Son of God was\npassing, yet feared that his efforts to thwart the plan of salvation had\nbeen in vain, that his kingdom was lost, and that he must finally be\ndestroyed.\nAfter Jesus had been nailed to the cross, it was raised and with\ngreat force thrust into the place which had been prepared for it in the\nground, tearing the flesh and causing the most intense suffering. To\nmake the death of Jesus as shameful as possible, two thieves were\ncrucified with Him, one on each side. The thieves were taken by\nforce, and after much resistance on their part, their arms were thrust\nback and nailed to their crosses. But Jesus meekly submitted. He\nneeded no one to force His arms back upon the cross. While the\nthieves were cursing their executioners, the Saviour in agony prayed\nfor His enemies, \u201cFather, forgive them; for they know not what they\ndo.\u201d It was not merely agony of body which Christ endured; the sins\nof the whole world were upon Him.\nAs Jesus hung upon the cross, some who passed by reviled Him, [177]\nwagging their heads as if bowing to a king, and said to Him, \u201cThou\nthat destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save Thyself.\nIf Thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.\u201d Satan used\nthe same words to Christ in the wilderness\u2014\u201cIf Thou be the Son\nof God.\u201d The chief priests, elders, and scribes mockingly said, \u201cHe\nsaved others; Himself He cannot save. If He be the King of Israel,\nlet Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him.\u201d\nThe angels who hovered over the scene of Christ\u2019s crucifixion were\nmoved to indignation as the rulers derided Him and said, \u201cIf He be\nthe Son of God, let Him deliver Himself\u201d. They wished there to come\nto the rescue of Jesus and deliver Him, but they were not suffered to\ndo so. The object of His mission was not yet accomplished.\nAs Jesus hung upon the cross during those long hours of agony,\nHe did not forget His mother. She had returned to the terrible scene,\nfor she could not longer remain away from her Son. The last lesson\nof Jesus was one of compassion and humanity. He looked upon the\ngrief-stricken face of His mother, and then upon His beloved disciple\nJohn. He said to His mother, \u201cWoman, behold thy son!\u201d Then He\nsaid to John, \u201cBehold thy mother!\u201d And from that hour John took\nher to his own house.\n178 Early Writings\nJesus thirsted in His agony, and they gave Him vinegar and gall\nto drink; but when He tasted it, He refused it. The angels had viewed\nthe agony of their loved Commander until they could behold no\nlonger, and they veiled their faces from the sight. The sun refused\nto look upon the awful scene. Jesus cried with a loud voice, which\nstruck terror to the hearts of His murderers, \u201c It is finished.\u201d Then\nthe veil of the temple was rent from the top to the bottom, the earth[178]\nshook, and the rocks rent. Great darkness was upon the face of the\nearth. The last hope of the disciples seemed swept away as Jesus\ndied. Many of His followers witnessed the scene of His sufferings\nand death, and their cup of sorrow was full.\nSatan did not then exult as he had done. He had hoped to break\nup the plan of salvation; but it was laid too deep. And now by the\ndeath of Christ he knew that he himself must finally die, and his\nkingdom be given to Jesus. He held a council with his angels. He\nhad prevailed nothing against the Son of God, and now they must\nincrease their efforts and with their power and cunning turn to His\nfollowers. They must prevent all whom they could from receiving\nthe salvation purchased for them by Jesus. By so doing Satan could\nstill work against the government of God. Also it would be for his\nown interest to keep from Jesus as many as possible. For the sins of\nthose who are redeemed by the blood of Christ will at last be rolled\nback upon the originator of sin, and he must bear their punishment,\nwhile those who do not accept salvation through Jesus will suffer\nthe penalty of their own sins.\nThe life of Christ had ever been without worldly wealth, honor,\nor display. His humility and self-denial had been in striking contrast\nto the pride and self-indulgence of the priests and elders. His spotless\npurity was a continual reproof of their sins. They despised Him for\nHis humility, holiness, and purity. But those who despised Him here\nwill one day see Him in the grandeur of heaven and the unsurpassed\nglory of His Father.\nIn the judgment hall He was surrounded by enemies who were\nthirsting for His blood; but those hardened ones who cried out, \u201cHis\nblood be on us, and on our children,\u201d will behold Him an honored\nKing. All the heavenly host will escort Him on His way with songs[179]\nof victory, majesty, and might to Him that was slain, yet lives again,\na mighty conqueror.\nCrucifixion of Christ 179\nPoor, weak, miserable man spat in the face of the King of glory,\nwhile a shout of brutal triumph arose from the mob at the degrading\ninsult. They marred with blows and cruelty that face which filled all\nheaven with admiration. They will again behold that face, bright as\nthe noonday sun, and will seek to flee from before it. Instead of that\nshout of brutal triumph, they will wail because of Him.\nJesus will present His hands with the marks of His crucifixion.\nThe marks of this cruelty He will ever bear. Every print of the nails\nwill tell the story of man\u2019s wonderful redemption and the dear price\nby which it was purchased. The very men who thrust the spear into\nthe side of the Lord of life will behold the print of the spear and will\nlament with deep anguish the part which they acted in marring His\nbody.\nHis murderers were greatly annoyed by the superscription, \u201cThe\nKing of the Jews,\u201d placed upon the cross above His head. But then\nthey will be obliged to see Him in all His glory and kingly power.\nThey will behold on His vesture and on His thigh, written in living\ncharacters, \u201cKing of kings, and Lord of lords.\u201d They cried to Him\nmockingly, as He hung upon the cross, \u201cLet Christ, the King of Israel,\ndescend from the cross, that we may see and believe.\u201d They will\nbehold Him then with kingly power and authority. They will demand\nno evidence of His being King of Israel; but overwhelmed with a\nsense of His majesty and exceeding glory, they will be compelled to\nacknowledge, \u201cBlessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d\nThe shaking of the earth, the rending of the rocks, the darkness [180]\nspread over the earth, and the loud, strong cry of Jesus, \u201c It is fin-\nished,\u201d as He yielded up His life, troubled His enemies and made\nHis murderers tremble. The disciples wondered at these singular\nmanifestations; but their hopes were crushed. They were afraid that\nthe Jews would seek to destroy them also. They felt assured that\nsuch hatred as had been manifested against the Son of God would\nnot end with Him. Lonely hours they spent in weeping over their\ndisappointment. They had expected that Jesus would reign a tem-\nporal Prince, but their hopes died with Him. In their sorrow and\ndisappointment, they doubted whether He had not deceived them.\nEven His mother wavered in her faith in Him as the Messiah.\nNotwithstanding the disciples had been disappointed in their\nhopes concerning Jesus, they yet loved Him and desired to give His\n180 Early Writings\nbody an honored burial, but knew not how to obtain it. Joseph of\nArimathaea, a wealthy and influential councilor of the Jews and a\ntrue disciple of Jesus, went privately yet boldly to Pilate and begged\nfrom him the Saviour\u2019s body. He dared not go openly, because of the\nhatred of the Jews. The disciples feared that an effort would be made\nby them to prevent the body of Christ from having an honored resting\nplace. Pilate granted the request, and the disciples took the lifeless\nform down from the cross, while in deep anguish they mourned over\ntheir blighted hopes. Carefully the body was wrapped in fine linen,\nand laid in Joseph\u2019s new sepulcher.\nThe women who had been Christ\u2019s humble followers while He\nlived, would not leave Him until they saw Him laid in the tomb\nand a stone of great weight placed before the door, lest His enemies\nshould seek to obtain His body. But they need not have feared; for I\nsaw that the angelic host watched with untold interest in the resting\nplace of Jesus, earnestly waiting for the command to act their part in[181]\nliberating the King of glory from His prison house.\nChrist\u2019s murderers feared that He might yet come to life and\nescape them. They therefore asked of Pilate a watch to guard the\nsepulcher until the third day. This was granted, and the stone at the\ndoor was sealed, lest His disciples should steal Him away and say\nthat He had risen from the dead.\nThe Resurrection of Christ\nThe disciples rested on the Sabbath, sorrowing for the death\nof their Lord, while Jesus, the King of glory, lay in the tomb. As\nnight drew on, soldiers were stationed to guard the Saviour\u2019s resting\nplace, while angels, unseen, hovered above the sacred spot. The\nnight wore slowly away, and while it was yet dark, the watching\nangels knew that the time for the release of God\u2019s dear Son, their\nloved Commander, had nearly come. As they were waiting with\nthe deepest emotion the hour of His triumph, a mighty angel came\nflying swiftly from heaven. His face was like the lightning, and his\ngarments white as snow. His light dispersed the darkness from his\ntrack and caused the evil angels, who had triumphantly claimed the\nbody of Jesus, to flee in terror from his brightness and glory. One of\nthe angelic host who had witnessed the scene of Christ\u2019s humiliation,\nand was watching His resting place, joined the angel from heaven,\nand together they came down to the sepulcher. The earth trembled\nand shook as they approached, and there was a great earthquake.\nTerror seized the Roman guard. Where was now their power [182]\nto keep the body of Jesus? They did not think of their duty or of\nthe disciples\u2019 stealing Him away. As the light of the angels shone\naround, brighter than the sun, that Roman guard fell as dead men to\nthe ground. One of the angels laid hold of the great stone and rolled\nit away from the door of the sepulcher and seated himself upon it.\nThe other entered the tomb and unbound the napkin from the head\nof Jesus. Then the angel from heaven, with a voice that caused the\nearth to quake, cried out, \u201cThou Son of God, Thy Father calls Thee!\nCome forth.\u201d Death could hold dominion over Him no longer. Jesus\narose from the dead, a triumphant conqueror. In solemn awe the\nangelic host gazed upon the scene. And as Jesus came forth from the\nsepulcher, those shining angels prostrated themselves to the earth in\nworship, and hailed Him with songs of victory and triumph.\nSatan\u2019s angels had been compelled to flee before the bright,\npenetrating light of the heavenly angels, and they bitterly complained\n181\n182 Early Writings\nto their king that their prey had been violently taken from them, and\nthat He whom they so much hated had risen from the dead. Satan\nand his hosts had exulted that their power over fallen man had caused\nthe Lord of life to be laid in the grave, but short was their hellish\ntriumph. For as Jesus walked forth from His prison house a majestic\nconqueror, Satan knew that after a season he must die, and his\nkingdom pass unto Him whose right it was. He lamented and raged\nthat notwithstanding all his efforts, Jesus had not been overcome,\nbut had opened a way of salvation for man, and whosoever would\nmight walk in it and be saved.\nThe evil angels and their commander met in council to consider\nhow they could still work against the government of God. Satan[183]\nbade his servants go to the chief priests and elders. Said he, \u201cWe\nsucceeded in deceiving them, blinding their eyes and hardening their\nhearts against Jesus. We made them believe that He was an impostor.\nThat Roman guard will carry the hateful news that Christ has risen.\nWe led the priests and elders on to hate Jesus and to murder Him.\nNow hold it before them that if it becomes known that Jesus is risen,\nthey will be stoned by the people for putting to death an innocent\nman.\u201d\nAs the host of heavenly angels departed from the sepulcher and\nthe light and glory passed away, the Roman guard ventured to raise\ntheir heads and look about them. They were filled with amazement\nas they saw that the great stone had been rolled from the door of the\nsepulcher and that the body of Jesus was gone. They hastened to\nthe city to make known to the priests and elders what they had seen.\nAs those murderers listened to the marvelous report, paleness sat\nupon every face. Horror seized them at the thought of what they had\ndone. If the report was correct, they were lost. For a time they sat in\nsilence, looking upon one another\u2019s faces, not knowing what to do or\nwhat to say. To accept the report would be to condemn themselves.\nThey went aside to consult as to what should be done. They reasoned\nthat if the report brought by the guard should be circulated among\nthe people, those who put Christ to death would be slain as His\nmurderers. It was decided to hire the soldiers to keep the matter\nsecret. The priests and elders offered them a large sum of money,\nsaying, \u201cSay ye, His disciples came by night, and stole Him away\nwhile we slept.\u201d And when the guard inquired what would be done\nResurrection of Christ 183\nwith them for sleeping at their post, the Jewish officers promised\nto persuade the governor and secure their safety. For the sake of\nmoney, the Roman guard sold their honor, and agreed to follow the [184]\ncounsel of the priests and elders.\nWhen Jesus, as He hung upon the cross, cried out, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d\nthe rocks rent, the earth shook, and some of the graves were opened.\nWhen He arose a victor over death and the grave, while the earth was\nreeling and the glory of heaven shone around the sacred spot, many\nof the righteous dead, obedient to His call, came forth as witnesses\nthat He had risen. Those favored, risen saints came forth glorified.\nThey were chosen and holy ones of every age, from creation down\neven to the days of Christ. Thus while the Jewish leaders were\nseeking to conceal the fact of Christ\u2019s resurrection, God chose to\nbring up a company from their graves to testify that Jesus had risen,\nand to declare His glory.\nThose risen ones differed in stature and form, some being more\nnoble in appearance than others. I was informed that the inhabitants\nof earth had been degenerating, losing their strength and comeliness.\nSatan has the power of disease and death, and with every age the\neffects of the curse have been more visible, and the power of Satan\nmore plainly seen. Those who lived in the days of Noah and Abra-\nham resembled the angels in form, comeliness, and strength. But\nevery succeeding generation have been growing weaker and more\nsubject to disease, and their life has been of shorter duration. Satan\nhas been learning how to annoy and enfeeble the race.\nThose who came forth after the resurrection of Jesus appeared\nto many, telling them that the sacrifice for man was completed, that\nJesus, whom the Jews crucified, had risen from the dead; and in\nproof of their words they declared, \u201cWe be risen with Him.\u201d They\nbore testimony that it was by His mighty power that they had been\ncalled forth from their graves. Notwithstanding the lying reports [185]\ncirculated, the resurrection of Christ could not be concealed by Satan,\nhis angels, or the chief priests; for this holy company, brought forth\nfrom their graves, spread the wonderful, joyful news; also Jesus\nshowed Himself to His sorrowing, heartbroken disciples, dispelling\ntheir fears and causing them joy and gladness.\nAs the news spread from city to city and from town to town,\nthe Jews in their turn feared for their lives and concealed the hatred\n184 Early Writings\nwhich they cherished toward the disciples. Their only hope was to\nspread their lying report. And those who wished this lie to be true\naccepted it. Pilate trembled as he heard that Christ had risen. He\ncould not doubt the testimony given, and from that hour peace left\nhim forever. For the sake of worldly honor, for fear of losing his\nauthority and his life, he had delivered Jesus to die. He was now\nfully convinced that it was not merely an innocent man of whose\nblood he was guilty, but the Son of God. Miserable to its close was\nthe life of Pilate. Despair and anguish crushed every hopeful, joyful\nfeeling. He refused to be comforted and died a most miserable death.\nHerod\u2019s [It was Herod Antipas who took part in the trial of\nChrist, and Herod Agrippa I who put James to death. Agrippa was\nnephew and brother-in-law of Antipas. Through intrigue he secured\nthe throne of Antipas for himself, and on coming to power pursued\nthe same course toward the Christians that Antipas had followed. In\nthe Herodian dynasty there were six persons who bore the name of\nHerod. It thus served in a measure as a general title, the individuals\nbeing designated by other names, as Antipas, Philip, Agrippa, etc.\nSo we might say Czar Nicholas, Czar Alexander, etc. In the present\ninstance this use of the term becomes more natural and appropriate\ninasmuch as Agrippa, when he put James to death, occupied the\nthrone of Antipas, who a little before had been concerned in the\ntrial of Christ; and he manifested the same character. It was the\nsame Herodian spirit, only in another personality, as \u201cthe dragon\u201d\nof Revelation 12:17 is the same as the dragon of verse 3, the real\ninspiring power in each being the dragon of verse 9. In the one\ncase he works through pagan Rome; in the other through our own\ngovernment.] heart had grown still harder; and when he heard that\nChrist had risen, he was not much troubled. He took the life of[186]\nJames, and when he saw that this pleased the Jews, he took Peter\nalso, intending to put him to death. But God had a work for Peter\nto do, and sent his angel to deliver him. Herod was visited with the\njudgments of God. While exalting himself in the presence of a great\nmultitude, he was smitten by the angel of the Lord, and died a most\nhorrible death.\nEarly in the morning of the first day of the week, before it was yet\nlight, holy women came to the sepulcher, bringing sweet spices to\nanoint the body of Jesus. They found that the heavy stone had been\nResurrection of Christ 185\nrolled away from the door of the sepulcher, and the body of Jesus was\nnot there. Their hearts sank within them, and they feared that their\nenemies had taken away the body. Suddenly they beheld two angels\nin white apparel, their faces bright and shining. These heavenly\nbeings understood the errand of the women and immediately told\nthem that Jesus was not there; He had risen, but they could behold the\nplace where He had lain. They bade them go and tell His disciples\nthat He would go before them into Galilee. With fear and great joy\nthe women hurried back to the sorrowing disciples and told them\nthe things which they had seen and heard.\nThe disciples could not believe that Christ had risen, but, with\nthe women who had brought the report, ran hastily to the sepulcher.\nThey found that Jesus was not there; they saw His linen clothes, but\ncould not believe the good news that He had risen from the dead.\nThey returned home marveling at what they had seen, also at the [187]\nreport brought them by the women. But Mary chose to linger around\nthe sepulcher, thinking of what she had seen, and distressed with the\nthought that she might have been deceived. She felt that new trials\nawaited her. Her grief was renewed, and she broke forth in bitter\nweeping. She stooped down to look again into the sepulcher, and\nbeheld two angels clothed in white. One was sitting where the head\nof Jesus had lain, the other where His feet had been. They spoke to\nher tenderly, and asked her why she wept. She replied, \u201cThey have\ntaken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\u201d\nAs she turned from the sepulcher, she saw Jesus standing near,\nbut knew Him not. He spoke to her tenderly, inquiring the cause of\nher sorrow and asking whom she was seeking. Supposing that He\nwas the gardener, she begged Him, if He had borne away her Lord, to\ntell her where He had laid Him, that she might take Him away. Jesus\nspoke to her with His own heavenly voice, saying, \u201cMary!\u201d She was\nacquainted with the tones of that dear voice, and quickly answered,\n\u201cMaster!\u201d and in her joy was about to embrace Him; but Jesus said,\n\u201cTouch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father: but go to\nMy brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your\nFather; and to My God, and your God.\u201d Joyfully she hastened to the\ndisciples with the good news. Jesus quickly ascended to His Father\nto hear from His lips that He accepted the sacrifice, and to receive\nall power in heaven and upon earth.\n186 Early Writings\nAngels like a cloud surrounded the Son of God and bade the\neverlasting gates be lifted up, that the King of glory might come\nin. I saw that while Jesus was with that bright heavenly host, in the\npresence of God, and surrounded by His glory, He did not forget His[188]\ndisciples upon the earth, but received power from His Father, that He\nmight return and impart power to them. The same day He returned\nand showed Himself to His disciples. He suffered them then to touch\nHim; for He had ascended to His Father and had received power.\nAt this time Thomas was not present. He would not humbly\nreceive the report of the disciples, but firmly and self-confidently\naffirmed that he would not believe unless he should put his fingers in\nthe prints of the nails and his hand in the side where the cruel spear\nwas thrust. In this he showed a lack of confidence in his brethren. If\nall should require the same evidence, none would now receive Jesus\nand believe in His resurrection. But it was the will of God that the\nreport of the disciples should be received by those who could not\nthemselves see and hear the risen Saviour. God was not pleased with\nthe unbelief of Thomas. When Jesus again met with His disciples,\nThomas was with them; and when he beheld Jesus, he believed. But\nhe had declared that he would not be satisfied without the evidence\nof feeling added to sight, and Jesus gave him the evidence which he\nhad desired. Thomas cried out, \u201cMy Lord and my God!\u201d But Jesus\nreproved him for his unbelief, saying, \u201cThomas, because thou hast\nseen Me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and\nyet have believed.\u201d\nIn like manner those who have had no experience in the first and\nsecond angels\u2019 messages must receive them from others who had\nan experience and followed down through the messages. As Jesus\nwas rejected, so I saw that these messages have been rejected. And\nas the disciples declared that there is salvation in no other name\nunder heaven, given among men, so also should the servants of\nGod faithfully and fearlessly warn those who embrace but a part of\nthe truths connected with the third message, that they must gladly[189]\nreceive all the messages as God has given them, or have no part in\nthe matter.\nWhile the holy women were carrying the report that Jesus had\nrisen, the Roman guard were circulating the lie that had been put\ninto their mouths by the chief priests and elders, that the disciples\nResurrection of Christ 187\ncame by night, while they slept, and stole the body of Jesus. Satan\nhad put this lie into the hearts and mouths of the chief priests, and\nthe people stood ready to receive their word. But God had made\nthis matter sure, and placed this important event, upon which our\nsalvation depends, beyond all doubt; and it was impossible for priests\nand elders to cover it up. Witnesses were raised from the dead to\ntestify to Christ\u2019s resurrection.\nJesus remained with His disciples forty days, causing them joy\nand gladness of heart as He opened to them more fully the realities\nof the kingdom of God. He commissioned them to bear testimony to\nthe things which they had seen and heard concerning His sufferings,\ndeath, and resurrection, that He had made a sacrifice for sin, and that\nall who would might come unto Him and find life. With faithful ten-\nderness He told them that they would be persecuted and distressed;\nbut they would find relief in recalling their experience and remem-\nbering the words which He had spoken to them. He told them that\nHe had overcome the temptations of Satan and obtained the victory\nthrough trials and suffering. Satan could have no more power over\nHim, but would bring his temptations to bear more directly upon\nthem and upon all who should believe in His name. But they could\novercome as He had overcome. Jesus endowed His disciples with\npower to work miracles, and told them that although they should\nbe persecuted by wicked men, He would from time to time send\nHis angels to deliver them; their lives could not be taken until their [190]\nmission should be accomplished; then they might be required to seal\nwith their blood the testimonies which they had borne.\nHis anxious followers gladly listened to His teachings, eagerly\nfeasting upon every word which fell from His holy lips. Now they\ncertainly knew that He was the Saviour of the world. His words\nsank deep into their hearts, and they sorrowed that they must soon be\nparted from their heavenly Teacher and no longer hear comforting,\ngracious words from His lips. But again their hearts were warmed\nwith love and exceeding joy, as Jesus told them that He would go\nand prepare mansions for them and come again and receive them,\nthat they might be ever with Him. He promised also to send the\nComforter, the Holy Spirit, to guide them into all truth. \u201cAnd He\nlifted up His hands, and blessed them.\u201d\nThe Ascension of Christ\nAll heaven was waiting the hour of triumph when Jesus should\nascend to His Father. Angels came to receive the King of glory\nand to escort Him triumphantly to heaven. After Jesus had blessed\nHis disciples, He was parted from them and taken up. And as He\nled the way upward, the multitude of captives who were raised at\nHis resurrection followed. A multitude of the heavenly host were\nin attendance, while in heaven an innumerable company of angels\nawaited His coming. As they ascended to the Holy City, the angels\nwho escorted Jesus cried out, \u201cLift up your heads, O ye gates; and be\nye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.\u201d\nThe angels in the city cried out with rapture, \u201cWho is this King of[191]\nglory?\u201d The escorting angels answered in triumph, \u201cThe Lord strong\nand mighty, the Lord mighty in battle! Lift up your heads, O ye\ngates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory\nshall come in!\u201d Again the waiting angels asked, \u201cWho is this King\nof glory?\u201d and the escorting angels answered in melodious strains,\n\u201cThe Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.\u201d And the heavenly train\npassed into the city of God. Then all the heavenly host surrounded\ntheir majestic Commander, and with the deepest adoration bowed\nbefore Him and cast their glittering crowns at His feet. And then\nthey touched their golden harps, and in sweet, melodious strains\nfilled all heaven with rich music and songs to the Lamb who was\nslain, yet lives again in majesty and glory.\nAs the disciples gazed sorrowfully toward heaven to catch the\nlast glimpse of their ascending Lord, two angels clothed in white\napparel stood by them and said to them, \u201cYe men of Galilee, why\nstand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up\nfrom you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen\nHim go into heaven.\u201d The disciples and the mother of Jesus, who\nwith them had witnessed the ascension of the Son of God, spent the\nfollowing night in talking over His wonderful acts and the strange\nand glorious events which had taken place within a short time.\n188\nAscension of Christ 189\nSatan again counseled with his angels, and with bitter hatred\nagainst God\u2019s government told them that while he retained his power\nand authority upon earth their efforts must be tenfold stronger against\nthe followers of Jesus. They had prevailed nothing against Christ but\nmust overthrow His followers, if possible. In every generation they\nmust seek to ensnare those who would believe in Jesus. He related\nto his angels that Jesus had given His disciples power to rebuke them [192]\nand cast them out, and to heal those whom they should afflict. Then\nSatan\u2019s angels went forth like roaring lions, seeking to destroy the\nfollowers of Jesus.\nThe Disciples of Christ\nWith mighty power the disciples preached a crucified and risen\nSaviour. Signs and wonders were wrought by them in the name of\nJesus; the sick were healed; and a man who had been lame from his\nbirth was restored to perfect soundness and entered with Peter and\nJohn into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God in the\nsight of all the people. The news spread, and the people began to\npress around the disciples. Many ran together, greatly astonished at\nthe cure that had been wrought.\nWhen Jesus died, the priests thought that no more miracles would\nbe performed among them, that the excitement would die out and\nthe people would again turn to the traditions of men. But lo! right\namong them the disciples were working miracles, and the people\nwere filled with amazement. Jesus had been crucified, and they\nwondered where His followers had obtained this power. When He\nwas alive, they thought that He imparted power to them; but when\nHe died, they expected the miracles to cease. Peter understood their\nperplexity and said to them, \u201cYe men of Israel, why marvel ye at\nthis? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power\nor holiness we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham,\nand of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His\nSon Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied Him in the presence\nof Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. But ye denied the[193]\nHoly One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto\nyou; and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the\ndead; whereof we are witnesses. And His name through faith in His\nname hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know.\u201d\nThe chief priests and elders could not bear these words, and at\ntheir command Peter and John were seized and put in prison. But\nthousands had been converted and led to believe in the resurrection\nand ascension of Christ by hearing only one discourse from the\ndisciples. The priests and elders were troubled. They had slain Jesus\nthat the minds of the people might be turned to themselves; but the\n190\nDisciples of Christ 191\nmatter was now worse than before. They were openly accused by the\ndisciples of being the murderers of the Son of God, and they could\nnot determine to what extent these things might grow or how they\nthemselves would be regarded by the people. They would gladly\nhave put Peter and John to death, but dared not, for fear of the people.\nOn the following day the apostles were brought before the coun-\ncil. The very men who had eagerly cried for the blood of the Just\nOne were there. They had heard Peter deny his Lord with cursing\nand swearing when charged with being one of His disciples, and they\nhoped again to intimidate him. But Peter had been converted, and he\nnow saw an opportunity to remove the stain of that hasty, cowardly\ndenial and to exalt the name which he had dishonored. With holy\nboldness, and in the power of the Spirit, he fearlessly declared unto\nthem, \u201cBy the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified,\nwhom God raised from the dead, even by Him doth this man stand\nhere before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought\nof you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither [194]\nis there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under\nheaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d\nThe people were astonished at the boldness of Peter and John\nand took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus; for\ntheir noble, fearless conduct was like that of Jesus when before His\nenemies. Jesus, by one look of pity and sorrow, reproved Peter when\nhe had denied Him, and now as he boldly acknowledged his Lord,\nPeter was approved and blessed. As a token of the approbation of\nJesus, he was filled with the Holy Spirit.\nThe priests dared not manifest the hatred which they felt toward\nthe disciples. They commanded them to go aside out of the council,\nand then conferred among themselves, saying, \u201cWhat shall we do to\nthese men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them\nis manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny\nit.\u201d They were afraid to have the report of this good deed spread\namong the people. Should it become generally known, the priests\nfelt that their own power would be lost, and they would be looked\nupon as the murderers of Jesus. Yet all that they dared to do was to\nthreaten the apostles and command them to speak no more in the\nname of Jesus, lest they die. But Peter declared boldly that they\ncould but speak the things which they had seen and heard.\n192 Early Writings\nBy the power of Jesus the disciples continued to heal the afflicted\nand the sick who were brought to them. Hundreds enlisted daily\nunder the banner of a crucified, risen, and ascended Saviour. The\npriests and elders, and those particularly engaged with them, were\nalarmed. Again they put the apostles in prison, hoping that the\nexcitement would subside. Satan and his angels exulted; but the\nangels of God opened the prison doors, and, contrary to the command[195]\nof the high priests and elders, bade the apostles, \u201cGo, stand and speak\nin the temple to the people all the words of this life.\u201d\nThe council assembled and sent for their prisoners. The officers\nunclosed the prison doors; but those whom they sought were not\nthere. They returned to the priests and elders and said, \u201cThe prison\ntruly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without\nbefore the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.\u201d\n\u201cThen came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye\nput in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.\nThen went the captain with the officers, and brought them without\nviolence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been\nstoned. And when they had brought them, they set them before the\ncouncil: and the high priest asked them, saying, Did not we straitly\ncommand you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold,\nye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this\nman\u2019s blood upon us.\u201d\nThose Jewish leaders were hypocrites; they loved the praise\nof men more than they loved God. Their hearts had become so\nhardened that the most mighty works wrought by the apostles only\nenraged them. They knew that if the disciples preached Jesus, His\ncrucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, it would fasten guilt upon\nthem as His murderers. They were not as willing to receive the blood\nof Jesus as when they vehemently cried, \u201cHis blood be on us, and\non our children.\u201d\nThe apostles boldly declared that they ought to obey God rather\nthan men. Said Peter, \u201cThe God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom\nye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with His right\nhand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel,[196]\nand forgiveness of sins. And we are His witnesses of these things;\nand so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that\nobey Him.\u201d At these fearless words those murderers were enraged,\nDisciples of Christ 193\nand determined to imbrue their hands again in blood by slaying the\napostles. They were planning to do this, when an angel from God\nmoved upon the heart of Gamaliel to counsel the priests and rulers:\n\u201cRefrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or\nthis work be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God,\nye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against\nGod.\u201d Evil angels were moving upon the priests and elders to put\nthe apostles to death; but God sent His angel to prevent it by raising\nup among the Jewish leaders themselves a voice in favor of His\nservants. The work of the apostles was not finished. They were to be\nbrought before kings to witness to the name of Jesus and to testify\nof the things which they had seen and heard.\nThe priests unwillingly released their prisoners, after beating\nthem and commanding them to speak no more in the name of Jesus.\n\u201cAnd they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that\nthey were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name. And daily\nin the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and\npreach Jesus Christ.\u201d Thus the word of God grew and multiplied.\nThe disciples boldly testified to the things which they had seen\nand heard, and through the name of Jesus they performed mighty\nmiracles. They fearlessly charged the blood of Jesus upon those who\nhad been so willing to receive it when they were permitted to have\npower over the Son of God.\nI saw that angels of God were commissioned to guard with\nspecial care the sacred, important truths which were to serve as an\nanchor to the disciples of Christ through every generation. The Holy [197]\nSpirit especially rested upon the apostles, who were witnesses of our\nLord\u2019s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension\u2014important truths\nwhich were to be the hope of Israel. All were to look to the Saviour\nof the world as their only hope, and walk in the way which He had\nopened by the sacrifice of His own life, and keep God\u2019s law and\nlive. I saw the wisdom and goodness of Jesus in giving power to the\ndisciples to carry on the same work for which He had been hated\nand slain by the Jews. In His name they had power over the works\nof Satan. A halo of light and glory centered about the time of Jesus\u2019\ndeath and resurrection, immortalizing the sacred truth that He was\nthe Saviour of the world.\nThe Death of Stephen\nDisciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and many of the priests\nwere obedient to the faith. Stephen, full of faith, was doing great\nwonders and miracles among the people. The Jewish leaders were\nstirred to greater anger as they saw priests turning from their tra-\nditions, and from the sacrifices and offerings, and accepting Jesus\nas the great sacrifice. With power from on high, Stephen reproved\nthe unbelieving priests and elders, and exalted Jesus before them.\nThey could not withstand the wisdom and power with which he\nspoke, and as they found that they could prevail nothing against\nhim, they hired men to swear falsely that they had heard him speak\nblasphemous words against Moses and against God. They stirred up\nthe people and took Stephen, and, through false witnesses, accused\nhim of speaking against the temple and the law. They testified that[198]\nthey had heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth would destroy the\ncustoms which Moses gave them.\nAs Stephen stood before his judges, the light of the glory of God\nrested upon his countenance. \u201cAnd all that sat in the council, looking\nsteadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.\u201d\nWhen called upon to answer to the charges brought against him, he\nbegan at Moses and the prophets and reviewed the history of the\nchildren of Israel and the dealings of God with them and showed how\nChrist had been foretold in prophecy. He referred to the history of\nthe temple and declared that God dwelleth not in temples made with\nhands. The Jews worshiped the temple and were filled with greater\nindignation at anything spoken against that building than if it had\nbeen spoken against God. As Stephen spoke of Christ and referred\nto the temple, he saw that the people were rejecting his words; and\nhe fearlessly rebuked them: \u201cYe stiffnecked and uncircumcised in\nheart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost.\u201d While they\nobserved the outward ordinances of their religion, their hearts were\ncorrupt and full of deadly evil. He referred to the cruelty of their\nfathers in persecuting the prophets, and declared that those whom\n194\nDeath of Stephen 195\nhe addressed had committed a greater sin in rejecting and crucifying\nChrist. \u201cWhich of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted?\nand they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the\nJust One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers.\u201d\nAs these plain, cutting truths were spoken, the priests and rulers\nwere enraged, and they rushed upon Stephen, gnashing their teeth.\n\u201cBut he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into\nheaven, and saw the glory of God,\u201d and said, \u201cBehold, I see the\nheavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of [199]\nGod.\u201d The people would not hear him. \u201cThey cried out with a loud\nvoice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and\ncast him out of the city, and stoned him.\u201d And he knelt down and\ncried with a loud voice, \u201cLord, lay not this sin to their charge.\u201d\nI saw that Stephen was a mighty man of God, especially raised\nup to fill an important place in the church. Satan exulted in his death;\nfor he knew that the disciples would greatly feel his loss. But Satan\u2019s\ntriumph was short; for in that company, witnessing the death of\nStephen, there was one to whom Jesus was to reveal Himself. Saul\ntook no part in casting the stones at Stephen, yet he consented to his\ndeath. He was zealous in persecuting the church of God, hunting\nthem, seizing them in their houses, and delivering them to those\nwho would slay them. Saul was a man of ability and education; his\nzeal and learning caused him to be highly esteemed by the Jews,\nwhile he was feared by many of the disciples of Christ. His talents\nwere effectively employed by Satan in carrying forward his rebellion\nagainst the Son of God, and those who believed in Him. But God\ncan break the power of the great adversary and set free those who\nare led captive by him. Christ had selected Saul as a \u201cchosen vessel\u201d\nto preach His name, to strengthen His disciples in their work, and to\nmore than fill the place of Stephen.\nThe Conversion of Saul[200]\nAs Saul journeyed to Damascus, with letters authorizing him\nto take men or women who were preaching Jesus, and bring them\nbound to Jerusalem, evil angels exulted around him. But suddenly\na light from heaven shone round about him, which made the evil\nangels flee and caused him to fall quickly to the ground. He heard a\nvoice saying, \u201cSaul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?\u201d Saul inquired,\n\u201cWho art Thou, Lord?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cI am Jesus whom thou\npersecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\u201d And Saul,\ntrembling and astonished, said, \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to\ndo?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cArise, and go into the city, and it shall be\ntold thee what thou must do.\u201d\nThe men who were with him stood speechless, hearing a voice,\nbut seeing no man. As the light passed away and Saul arose from\nthe earth and opened his eyes, he found himself totally deprived of\nsight. The glory of the light of heaven had blinded him. They led\nhim by the hand and brought him to Damascus, and he was three\ndays without sight, neither did he eat nor drink. The Lord then sent\nHis angel to one of the very men whom Saul had hoped to take\ncaptive and revealed to him in vision that he should go into the street\ncalled Straight, \u201cand inquire in the house of Judas for one called\nSaul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a\nman named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he\nmight receive his sight.\u201d\nAnanias feared that there might be some mistake in this matter,\nand began to relate to the Lord what he had heard of Saul. But the\nLord said unto Ananias, \u201cGo thy way: for he is a chosen vessel[201]\nunto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the\nchildren of Israel: for I will show him how great things he must\nsuffer for My name\u2019s sake.\u201d Ananias followed the directions of the\nLord, and entered into the house, and putting his hands on him, said,\n\u201cBrother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the\n196\nConversion of Saul 197\nway as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy\nsight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.\u201d\nImmediately Saul received sight and arose and was baptized.\nHe then taught in the synagogues that Jesus was indeed the Son of\nGod. All who heard him were amazed and inquired, \u201cIs not this\nhe that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem,\nand came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound\nunto the chief priests?\u201d But Saul increased the more in strength,\nand confounded the Jews. They were again in trouble. All were\nacquainted with Saul\u2019s opposition to Jesus and his zeal in hunting\nout and delivering up to death all who believed on His name; and his\nmiraculous conversion convinced many that Jesus was the Son of\nGod. Saul related his experience in the power of the Holy Spirit. He\nwas persecuting unto death, binding and delivering into prison both\nmen and women, when, as he journeyed to Damascus, suddenly a\ngreat light from heaven shone round about him, and Jesus revealed\nHimself to him, and taught him that He was the Son of God.\nAs Saul thus boldly preached Jesus, he exerted a powerful influ-\nence. He had a knowledge of the Scriptures, and after his conversion\na divine light shone upon the prophecies concerning Jesus, which\nenabled him clearly and boldly to present the truth and to correct\nany perversion of the Scriptures. With the Spirit of God resting\nupon him, he would in a clear and forcible manner carry his hearers [202]\ndown through the prophecies to the time of Christ\u2019s first advent and\nshow them that the scriptures had been fulfilled which referred to\nHis sufferings, death, and resurrection.\nThe Jews Decide to Kill Paul\nAs the chief priests and rulers witnessed the effect of the relation\nof Paul\u2019s experience, they were moved with hatred against him. They\nsaw that he boldly preached Jesus and wrought miracles in His name,\nthat multitudes listened to him and turned from their traditions and\nlooked upon the Jewish leaders as the murderers of the Son of God.\nTheir anger was kindled, and they assembled to consult as to what\nwas best to be done to put down the excitement. They agreed that\nthe only safe course was to put Paul to death. But God knew of\ntheir intention, and angels were commissioned to guard him, that he\nmight live to fulfill his mission.\nLed by Satan, the unbelieving Jews watched the gates of Dam-\nascus day and night, that as Paul should pass out, they might im-\nmediately kill him. But Paul had been informed that the Jews were\nseeking his life, and the disciples let him down over the wall in a\nbasket by night. At this failure to carry out their purposes, the Jews\nwere ashamed and indignant, and Satan\u2019s object was defeated.\nAfter this, Paul went to Jerusalem to join himself to the disciples;\nbut they were all afraid of him. They could not believe that he was\na disciple. His life had been hunted by the Jews in Damascus, and\nhis own brethren would not receive him; but Barnabas took him and\nbrought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen[203]\nthe Lord in the way and that he had preached boldly at Damascus in\nthe name of Jesus.\nBut Satan was stirring up the Jews to destroy Paul, and Jesus\nbade him leave Jerusalem. In company with Barnabas, he went into\nother cities, preaching Jesus and working miracles, and many were\nconverted. As one man was healed who had always been lame, the\npeople who worshiped idols were about to sacrifice to the disciples.\nPaul was grieved, and told them that he and his fellow laborer were\nonly men and that the God who made heaven and earth, the sea,\nand all things that are therein, must alone be worshiped. Thus Paul\nexalted God before the people; but he could scarcely restrain them.\n198\nJews Decide to Kill Paul 199\nThe first conception of faith in the true God, and of the worship and\nhonor due to Him, was being formed in their minds; and as they\nwere listening to Paul, Satan was urging on the unbelieving Jews of\nother cities to follow after Paul to destroy the good work wrought\nthrough him. These Jews stirred up the minds of those idolaters by\nfalse reports against Paul. The wonder and admiration of the people\nnow changed to hate, and they who a short time before were ready\nto worship the disciples, stoned Paul and drew him out of the city,\nsupposing that he was dead. But as the disciples were standing about\nPaul and mourning over him, to their joy he rose up and went with\nthem into the city.\nAgain, as Paul and Silas preached Jesus, a certain woman pos-\nsessed with a spirit of divination followed them, crying, \u201cThese men\nare the servants of the most high God, which show unto us the way\nof salvation.\u201d Thus she followed the disciples many days. But Paul\nwas grieved; for this crying after them diverted the minds of the\npeople from the truth. Satan\u2019s object in leading her to do this was to\ndisgust the people and destroy the influence of the disciples. Paul\u2019s [204]\nspirit was stirred within him, and he turned and said to the spirit, \u201cI\ncommand thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her\u201d; and\nthe evil spirit was rebuked, and left her.\nHer masters were pleased that she cried after the disciples; but\nwhen the evil spirit left her, and they saw her a meek disciple of\nChrist, they were enraged. They had gathered much money by her\nfortunetelling, and now the hope of their gain was gone. Satan\u2019s\nobject was defeated; but his servants caught Paul and Silas, and drew\nthem into the market place, unto the rulers, and to the magistrates,\nsaying, \u201cThese men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city.\u201d\nAnd the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates\nrent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them. And when\nthey had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison,\ncharging the jailer to keep them safely, who, having received such a\ncharge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in\nthe stocks. But the angels of the Lord accompanied them within the\nprison walls, and caused their imprisonment to tell to the glory of\nGod, and show to the people that God was in the work, and with His\nchosen servants.\n200 Early Writings\nAt midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God,\nand suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of\nthe prison were shaken; and I saw that immediately the angel of God\nloosed everyone\u2019s bands. The keeper of the prison, upon awaking\nand seeing the prison doors open, was affrighted. He thought that\nthe prisoners had escaped, and that he must be punished with death.\nBut as he was about to kill himself, Paul cried with a loud voice,\nsaying, \u201cDo thyself no harm: for we are all here.\u201d\nThe power of God there convicted the jailer. He called for a[205]\nlight, and springing in, came trembling and fell down before Paul\nand Silas, and brought them out, and said, \u201cSirs, what must I do to\nbe saved?\u201d And they said, \u201cBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and\nthou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d The keeper of the prison then\nassembled his whole household, and Paul preached unto them Jesus.\nThus the jailer\u2019s heart was united to those of his brethren, and he\nwashed their stripes, and he and all his house were baptized that\nnight. He then set food before them, and rejoiced, believing in God\nwith all his house.\nThe wonderful news of the manifestation of the power of God\nin opening the prison doors, and in the conversion of the keeper\nand his family, was soon spread abroad. The rulers heard of these\nthings, and were afraid, and sent to the jailer, requesting him to let\nPaul and Silas go. But Paul would not leave the prison in a private\nmanner; he was not willing that the manifestation of the power of\nGod should be concealed. He said unto them, \u201cThey have beaten us\nopenly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison;\nand now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come\nthemselves and fetch us out.\u201d When these words were told to the\nmagistrates, and it was known that the apostles were Roman citizens,\nthe rulers were alarmed for fear they would make complaint to the\nemperor of their unlawful treatment. And they came and besought\nthem, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the\ncity.\nPaul Visits Jerusalem [206]\nAfter Paul\u2019s conversion, he visited Jerusalem and there preached\nJesus and the wonders of His grace. He related his miraculous\nconversion, which so enraged the priests and rulers that they sought\nto take his life. But that he might be saved, Jesus again appeared to\nhim in a vision while he was praying, and said unto him, \u201cGet thee\nquickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive thy testimony\nconcerning Me.\u201d Paul answered, \u201cLord, they know that I imprisoned\nand beat in every synagogue them that believed on Thee: and when\nthe blood of Thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by,\nand consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that\nslew him.\u201d Paul thought that the Jews in Jerusalem could not resist\nhis testimony; that they would consider that the great change in him\ncould be wrought only by the power of God. But the reply was more\ndecided than before: \u201cDepart: for I will send thee far hence unto the\nGentiles.\u201d\nDuring Paul\u2019s absence from Jerusalem, he wrote many letters\nto different places, relating his experience and bearing a powerful\ntestimony. But some strove to destroy the influence of those letters.\nThey were forced to admit that his letters were weighty and powerful,\nbut they declared that his bodily presence was weak and his speech\ncontemptible.\nThe facts in the case were that Paul was a man of great learning,\nand his wisdom and manners charmed his hearers. Learned men\nwere pleased with his knowledge, and many of them believed on\nJesus. When before kings and large assemblies, he would pour\nforth such eloquence as would fascinate all before him. This greatly\nenraged the priests and elders. Paul could readily enter into deep [207]\nreasoning and, soaring up, carry the people with him in the most\nexalted trains of thought, bringing to view the deep riches of the\ngrace of God and portraying before them the amazing love of Christ.\nThen with simplicity he would come down to the understanding\nof the common people and in a most powerful manner relate his\n201\n202 Early Writings\nexperience, which called forth from them an ardent desire to become\nthe disciples of Christ.\nAgain the Lord appeared to Paul and revealed to him that he\nmust go up to Jerusalem, that he would there be bound and suffer for\nHis name. Although he was a prisoner for a great length of time, yet\nthe Lord carried forward His special work through him. His bonds\nwere to be the means of spreading the knowledge of Christ and thus\nglorifying God. As he was sent from city to city for his trial, his\ntestimony concerning Jesus and the interesting incidents of his own\nconversion were related before kings and governors, that they should\nbe left without excuse concerning Jesus. Thousands believed on\nHim and rejoiced in His name. I saw that God\u2019s special purpose was\nfulfilled in the journey of Paul upon the sea; He designed that the\nship\u2019s crew might thus witness the power of God through Paul and\nthat the heathen also might hear the name of Jesus, and that many\nmight be converted through the teaching of Paul and by witnessing\nthe miracles he wrought. Kings and governors were charmed by\nhis reasoning, and as with zeal and the power of the Holy Spirit he\npreached Jesus and related the interesting events of his experience,\nconviction fastened upon them that Jesus was the Son of God. While\nsome wondered with amazement as they listened to Paul, one cried\nout, \u201cAlmost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.\u201d Yet the most of\nthose who heard thought that at some future time they would consider[208]\nwhat they had heard. Satan took advantage of the delay, and, as they\nneglected the opportunity when their hearts were softened, it was\nforever lost. Their hearts became hardened.\nI was shown the work of Satan in first blinding the eyes of the\nJews so that they would not receive Jesus as their Saviour; and next\nin leading them, through envy because of His mighty works, to\ndesire His life. Satan entered one of Christ\u2019s own followers and led\nhim on to betray Him into the hands of His enemies, that they might\ncrucify the Lord of life and glory.\nAfter Jesus arose from the dead, the Jews added sin to sin as they\nsought to hide the fact of His resurrection by hiring the Roman guard\nto testify to a falsehood. But the resurrection of Jesus was made\ndoubly sure by the resurrection of a multitude of witnesses at the\nsame time. After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples,\nPaul Visits Jerusalem 203\nand to above five hundred at once, while those whom He brought up\nwith Him appeared unto many, declaring that Jesus had risen.\nSatan had caused the Jews to rebel against God by refusing to\nreceive His Son, and by staining their hands with His most precious\nblood. No matter how powerful the evidence now produced that\nJesus was the Son of God, the Redeemer of the world, they had\nmurdered Him, and would not receive any evidence in His favor.\nTheir only hope and consolation, like that of Satan after his fall, was\nin trying to prevail against the Son of God. They therefore continued\ntheir rebellion by persecuting the disciples of Christ, and putting\nthem to death. Nothing fell so harshly on their ears as the name of\nJesus whom they had crucified; and they were determined not to\nlisten to any evidence in His favor. As when the Holy Spirit through\nStephen declared the mighty evidence of Jesus\u2019 being the Son of [209]\nGod, they stopped their ears lest they should be convinced. Satan\nhad the murderers of Jesus fast in his grasp. By wicked works they\nhad yielded themselves his willing subjects, and through them he\nwas at work to trouble and annoy the believers in Christ. He worked\nthrough the Jews to stir up the Gentiles against Jesus and against\nthose who followed Him. But God sent His angels to strengthen the\ndisciples for their work, that they might testify of the things they had\nseen and heard, and at last by their steadfastness, seal their testimony\nwith their blood.\nSatan rejoiced that the Jews were safe in his snare. They still\ncontinued their useless forms, their sacrifices, and ordinances. As\nJesus hung upon the cross and cried, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d the veil of the\ntemple was rent in twain from top to bottom, to signify that God\nwould no longer meet with the priests in the temple, to accept their\nsacrifices and ordinances, and also to show that the partition wall\nbetween the Jews and the Gentiles was broken down. Jesus had\nmade an offering of Himself for both, and if saved at all, both must\nbelieve in Him as the only offering for sin, the Saviour of the world.\nWhen the soldier pierced the side of Jesus as He hung upon the\ncross, there came out two distinct streams, one of blood, the other\nof water. The blood was to wash away the sins of those who should\nbelieve in His name, and the water was to represent that living water\nwhich is obtained from Jesus to give life to the believer.\nThe Great Apostasy[210]\nI was carried forward to the time when heathen idolaters cruelly\npersecuted and killed the Christians. Blood flowed in torrents. The\nnoble, the learned, and the common people were alike slain without\nmercy. Wealthy families were reduced to poverty, because they\nwould not yield their religion. Notwithstanding the persecution and\nsufferings which these Christians endured, they would not lower the\nstandard. They kept their religion pure. I saw that Satan exulted and\ntriumphed over their sufferings. But God looked upon His faithful\nmartyrs with great approbation. The Christians who lived in that\nfearful time were greatly beloved of Him, because they were willing\nto suffer for His sake. Every suffering endured by them increased\ntheir reward in heaven.\nAlthough Satan rejoiced because of the sufferings of the saints,\nyet he was not satisfied. He wanted control of the mind as well as\nthe body. The sufferings that they endured only drove them closer to\nthe Lord, leading them to love one another, and causing them to fear\nmore than ever to offend Him. Satan wished to lead them to displease\nGod; then they would lose their strength, fortitude, and firmness.\nAlthough thousands were slain, yet others were springing up to\nsupply their places. Satan saw that he was losing his subjects; for\nalthough they suffered persecution and death, yet they were secured\nto Jesus Christ, to be the subjects of His kingdom. Satan therefore\nlaid his plans to fight more successfully against the government\nof God and overthrow the church. He led the heathen idolaters to\nembrace a part of the Christian faith. They professed to believe in\nthe crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, and proposed to unite with[211]\nthe followers of Jesus, without a change of heart. Oh, the fearful\ndanger of the church. It was a time of mental anguish. Some thought\nthat if they should come down and unite with those idolaters who\nhad embraced a portion of the Christian faith, it would be the means\nof their full conversion. Satan was seeking to corrupt the doctrines\nof the Bible.\n204\nGreat Apostasy 205\nI saw that at last the standard was lowered, and that the heathen\nwere uniting with the Christians. Although these worshipers of idols\nprofessed to be converted, they brought their idolatry with them into\nthe church, only changing the objects of their worship to images of\nsaints, and even of Christ and of Mary His mother. As the followers\nof Christ gradually united with them, the Christian religion became\ncorrupted and the church lost its purity and power. Some refused\nto unite with them; such preserved their purity and worshiped God\nalone. They would not bow down to an image of anything in the\nheavens above or in the earth beneath.\nSatan exulted over the fall of so many; and then he stirred up the\nfallen church to force those who would preserve the purity of their\nreligion either to yield to their ceremonies and image worship or be\nput to death. The fires of persecution were again kindled against the\ntrue church of Christ, and millions were slain without mercy.\nIt was presented before me in the following manner: A large\ncompany of heathen idolaters bore a black banner, upon which were\nfigures of the sun, moon, and stars. This company seemed to be very\nfierce and angry. I was then shown another company bearing a pure\nwhite banner, upon which was written, \u201cPurity and holiness unto the\nLord.\u201d Their countenances were marked with firmness and heavenly\nresignation. I saw the heathen idolaters approach them, and there [212]\nwas a great slaughter. The Christians melted away before them; and\nyet the Christian company pressed the more closely together, and\nheld the banner more firmly. As many fell, others rallied around the\nbanner and filled their places.\nI saw the company of idolaters consulting together. Failing to\nmake the Christians yield, they agreed to another plan. I saw them\nlower their banner and then approach that firm Christian company\nand make propositions to them. At first their propositions were ut-\nterly refused. Then I saw the Christian company consulting together.\nSome said that they would lower the banner, accept the propositions,\nand save their lives, and at last they could gain strength to raise their\nbanner among the heathen. A few, however, would not yield to this\nplan, but firmly chose to die holding their banner rather than to lower\nit. Then I saw many lower the banner and unite with the heathen;\nbut the firm and steadfast would again seize it and bear it on high.\nI saw that persons were continually leaving the company of those\n206 Early Writings\nwho bore the pure banner, and were uniting with the idolaters under\nthe black banner, to persecute those bearing the white banner. Many\nwere slain, yet the white banner was held high, and believers were\nraised up to rally around it.\nThe Jews who first aroused the rage of the heathen against Jesus\nwere not to escape unpunished. In the judgment hall, as Pilate\nhesitated to condemn Jesus, the infuriated Jews cried, \u201cHis blood\nbe on us, and on our children.\u201d The fulfillment of this terrible curse\nwhich they called down upon their own heads, the Jewish nation\nhas experienced. The heathen and those called Christians alike have\nbeen their foes. Those professed Christians, in their zeal for Christ,\nwhom the Jews crucified, thought that the more suffering they could[213]\nbring upon them, the better would God be pleased. Many of the\nunbelieving Jews were therefore killed, while others were driven\nfrom place to place and were punished in almost every manner.\nThe blood of Christ and of the disciples, whom they had put to\ndeath, was upon them, and they were visited with terrible judgments.\nThe curse of God followed them, and they were a byword and a\nderision to the heathen and to so-called Christians. They were\ndegraded, shunned, and detested, as if the brand of Cain were upon\nthem. Yet I saw that God had marvelously preserved this people\nand scattered them over the world that they might be looked upon as\nspecially visited by the curse of God. I saw that God had forsaken\nthe Jews as a nation; but that individuals among them will yet be\nconverted and be enabled to tear the veil from their hearts and see that\nthe prophecy concerning them has been fulfilled; they will receive\nJesus as the Saviour of the world and see the great sin of their nation\nin rejecting and crucifying Him.\nThe Mystery of Iniquity\nIt has ever been the design of Satan to draw the minds of the\npeople from Jesus to man, and to destroy individual accountability.\nSatan failed in his design when he tempted the Son of God; but he\nsucceeded better when he came to fallen man. Christianity became\ncorrupted. Popes and priests presumed to take an exalted position,\nand taught the people to look to them for the pardon of their sins,\ninstead of looking to Christ for themselves.\nThe people were wholly deceived. They were taught that the [214]\npopes and priests were Christ\u2019s representatives, when in fact they\nwere the representatives of Satan, and those who bowed to them\nworshiped Satan. The people called for the Bible; but the priests\nconsidered it dangerous to let them have it to read for themselves,\nlest they should become enlightened and expose the sins of their\nleaders. The people were taught to receive every word from these\ndeceivers as from the mouth of God. They held that power over\nthe mind which God alone should hold. If any dared to follow their\nown convictions, the same hate which Satan and the Jews exercised\ntoward Jesus would be kindled against them, and those in authority\nwould thirst for their blood.\nI was shown a time when Satan especially triumphed. Multitudes\nof Christians were slain in a dreadful manner, because they would\npreserve the purity of their religion. The Bible was hated, and efforts\nwere made to rid the earth of it. The people were forbidden to read\nit, on pain of death; and all the copies which could be found were\nburned. But I saw that God had a special care for His Word. He\nprotected it. At different periods there were but a very few copies of\nthe Bible in existence, yet He would not suffer His Word to be lost,\nfor in the last days copies of it were to be so multiplied that every\nfamily could possess it. I saw that when there were but few copies of\nthe Bible, it was precious and comforting to the persecuted followers\nof Jesus. It was read in the most secret manner, and those who had\nthis exalted privilege felt that they had had an interview with God,\n207\n208 Early Writings\nwith His Son Jesus, and with His disciples. But this blessed privilege\ncost many of them their lives. If discovered, they were taken to the\nheadsman\u2019s block, to the stake, or to the dungeon to die of starvation.\nSatan could not hinder the plan of salvation. Jesus was crucified,[215]\nand rose again the third day. But Satan told his angels that he would\nmake the crucifixion and resurrection tell to his advantage. He was\nwilling that those who professed faith in Jesus should believe that\nthe laws regulating the Jewish sacrifices and offerings ceased at the\ndeath of Christ, if he could push them farther and make them believe\nthat the law of ten commandments also died with Christ.\nI saw that many readily yielded to this device of Satan. All\nheaven was moved with indignation as they saw the holy law of God\ntrampled underfoot. Jesus and all the heavenly host were acquainted\nwith the nature of God\u2019s law; they knew that He would not change\nor abrogate it. The hopeless condition of man after the fall caused\nthe deepest sorrow in heaven, and moved Jesus to offer to die for the\ntransgressors of God\u2019s holy law. But if that law could be abrogated,\nman might have been saved without the death of Jesus. Consequently\nHis death did not destroy the law of His Father, but magnified and\nhonored it and enforced obedience to all its holy precepts.\nHad the church remained pure and steadfast, Satan could not\nhave deceived them, and led them to trample on the law of God. In\nthis bold plan, Satan strikes directly against the foundation of God\u2019s\ngovernment in heaven and on earth. His rebellion caused him to be\nexpelled from heaven. After he rebelled, in order to save himself\nhe wished God to change His law, but was told before the whole\nheavenly host that God\u2019s law was unalterable. Satan knows that if\nhe can cause others to violate God\u2019s law, he has gained them to his\ncause; for every transgressor of that law must die.\nSatan decided to go still farther. He told his angels that some\nwould be so jealous of God\u2019s law that they could not be caught in this[216]\nsnare; the ten commandments were so plain that many would believe\nthat they were still binding, and therefore he must seek to corrupt\nonly one of the commandments. He then led on his representatives\nto attempt to change the fourth, or Sabbath, commandment, thus\naltering the only one of the ten which brings to view the true God,\nthe Maker of the heavens and the earth. Satan presented before them\nthe glorious resurrection of Jesus, and told them that by His rising on\nMystery of Iniquity 209\nthe first day of the week, He changed the Sabbath from the seventh\nto the first day of the week.\nThus Satan used the resurrection to serve his purpose. He and his\nangels rejoiced that the errors they had prepared took so well with\nthe professed friends of Christ. What one looked upon with religious\nhorror, another would receive. Thus different errors were received\nand defended with zeal. The will of God, so plainly revealed in His\nWord, was covered up with errors and traditions, which have been\ntaught as the commandments of God. Although this heaven-daring\ndeception will be suffered to be carried on until the second appearing\nof Jesus, yet through all this time of error and deception, God has\nnot been left without witnesses. Amid the darkness and persecution\nof the church there have always been true and faithful ones who kept\nall of God\u2019s commandments.\nI saw that the angelic host were filled with amazement as they\nbeheld the sufferings and death of the King of glory. But I saw that\nit was no marvel to them that the Lord of life and glory, He who\nfilled all heaven with joy and splendor, should break the bands of\ndeath, and walk forth from His prison house, a triumphant conqueror.\nTherefore, if either of these events should be commemorated by a\nday of rest, it is the crucifixion. But I saw that neither of these events [217]\nwas designed to alter or abrogate God\u2019s law; on the contrary, they\ngive the strongest proof of its immutability.\nBoth of these important events have their memorials. By par-\ntaking of the Lord\u2019s supper, the broken bread and the fruit of the\nvine, we show forth the Lord\u2019s death until He comes. The scenes of\nHis sufferings and death are thus brought fresh to our minds. The\nresurrection of Christ is commemorated by our being buried with\nHim by baptism, and raised out of the watery grave, in likeness of\nHis resurrection, to live in newness of life.\nI was shown that the law of God would stand fast forever, and\nexist in the new earth to all eternity. At the creation, when the\nfoundations of the earth were laid, the sons of God looked with\nadmiration upon the work of the Creator, and all the heavenly host\nshouted for joy. It was then that the foundation of the Sabbath was\nlaid. At the close of the six days of creation, God rested on the\nseventh day from all His work which He had made; and He blessed\nthe seventh day and sanctified it, because that in it He had rested\n210 Early Writings\nfrom all His work. The Sabbath was instituted in Eden before the\nfall, and was observed by Adam and Eve, and all the heavenly host.\nGod rested on the seventh day, and blessed and hallowed it. I saw\nthat the Sabbath never will be done away; but that the redeemed\nsaints, and all the angelic host, will observe it in honor of the great\nCreator to all eternity.\nDeath Not Eternal Life in Misery [218]\nSatan commenced his deception in Eden. He said to Eve, \u201cYe\nshall not surely die.\u201d This was Satan\u2019s first lesson upon the immor-\ntality of the soul, and he has carried on this deception from that\ntime to the present, and will carry it on until the captivity of God\u2019s\nchildren shall be turned. I was pointed to Adam and Eve in Eden.\nThey partook of the forbidden tree, and then the flaming sword was\nplaced around the tree of life, and they were driven from the garden,\nlest they should partake of the tree of life, and be immortal sinners.\nThe fruit of this tree was to perpetuate immortality. I heard an angel\nask, \u201cWho of the family of Adam have passed that flaming sword,\nand have partaken of the tree of life?\u201d I heard another angel answer,\n\u201cNot one of the family of Adam has passed that flaming sword, and\npartaken of that tree; therefore there is not an immortal sinner.\u201d The\nsoul that sinneth, it shall die an everlasting death\u2014a death from\nwhich there will be no hope of resurrection; and then the wrath of\nGod will be appeased.\nIt was a marvel to me that Satan could succeed so well in making\nmen believe that the words of God, \u201cThe soul that sinneth, it shall\ndie,\u201d mean that the soul that sinneth it shall not die, but live eternally\nin misery. Said the angel, \u201cLife is life, whether it is in pain or\nhappiness. Death is without pain, without joy, without hatred.\u201d\nSatan told his angels to make a special effort to spread the lie first\nrepeated to Eve in Eden, \u201cYe shall not surely die.\u201d And as the error\nwas received by the people, and they were led to believe that man\nwas immortal, Satan led them on to believe that the sinner would [219]\nlive in eternal misery. Then the way was prepared for Satan to work\nthrough his representatives and hold up God before the people as\na revengeful tyrant\u2014one who plunges all those into hell who do\nnot please Him, and causes them ever to feel His wrath; and while\nthey suffer unutterable anguish, and writhe in the eternal flames, He\nis represented as looking down upon them with satisfaction. Satan\nknew that if this error should be received, God would be hated by\n211\n212 Early Writings\nmany, instead of being loved and adored; and that many would be led\nto believe that the threatenings of God\u2019s Word would not be literally\nfulfilled, for it would be against His character of benevolence and\nlove to plunge into eternal torments the beings whom He had created.\nAnother extreme which Satan has led the people to adopt is\nentirely to overlook the justice of God, and the threatenings in His\nWord, and to represent Him as being all mercy, so that not one will\nperish, but that all, both saint and sinner, will at last be saved in His\nkingdom.\nIn consequence of the popular errors of the immortality of the\nsoul and endless misery, Satan takes advantage of another class and\nleads them to regard the Bible as an uninspired book. They think it\nteaches many good things; but they cannot rely upon it and love it,\nbecause they have been taught that it declares the doctrine of eternal\nmisery.\nAnother class Satan leads on still further, even to deny the exis-\ntence of God. They can see no consistency in the character of the\nGod of the Bible, if He will inflict horrible tortures upon a portion\nof the human family to all eternity. Therefore they deny the Bible\nand its Author and regard death as an eternal sleep.\nThere is still another class who are fearful and timid. These[220]\nSatan tempts to commit sin, and after they have sinned, he holds up\nbefore them that the wages of sin is not death but life in horrible\ntorments, to be endured throughout the endless ages of eternity. By\nthus magnifying before their feeble minds the horrors of an endless\nhell, he takes possession of their minds, and they lose their reason.\nThen Satan and his angels exult, and the infidel and atheist join in\ncasting reproach upon Christianity. They claim that these evils are\nthe natural results of believing in the Bible and its Author, whereas\nthey are the results of the reception of popular heresy.\nI saw that the heavenly host were filled with indignation at this\nbold work of Satan. I inquired why all these delusions should be\nsuffered to take effect upon the minds of men when the angels of\nGod were powerful, and if commissioned, could easily break the\nenemy\u2019s power. Then I saw that God knew that Satan would try\nevery art to destroy man; therefore He had caused His word to be\nwritten out, and had made His purposes in regard to the human race\nso plain that the weakest need not err. After having given His word\nDeath Not Eternal Life in Misery 213\nto man, He had carefully preserved it from destruction by Satan or\nhis angels, or by any of his agents or representatives. While other\nbooks might be destroyed, this was to be immortal. And near the\nclose of time, when the delusions of Satan should increase, it was\nto be so multiplied that all who desired might have a copy, and, if\nthey would, might arm themselves against the deceptions and lying\nwonders of Satan.\nI saw that God had especially guarded the Bible; yet when copies\nof it were few, learned men had in some instances changed the words,\nthinking that they were making it more plain, when in reality they\nwere mystifying that which was plain, by causing it to lean to their [221]\nestablished views, which were governed by tradition. But I saw that\nthe Word of God, as a whole, is a perfect chain, one portion linking\ninto and explaining another. True seekers for truth need not err; for\nnot only is the Word of God plain and simple in declaring the way\nof life, but the Holy Spirit is given as a guide in understanding the\nway to life therein revealed.\nI saw that the angels of God are never to control the will. God\nsets before man life and death. He can have his choice. Many desire\nlife, but still continue to walk in the broad road. They choose to\nrebel against God\u2019s government, notwithstanding His great mercy\nand compassion in giving His Son to die for them. Those who do\nnot choose to accept of the salvation so dearly purchased, must be\npunished. But I saw that God would not shut them up in hell to\nendure endless misery, neither will He take them to heaven; for to\nbring them into the company of the pure and holy would make them\nexceedingly miserable. But He will destroy them utterly and cause\nthem to be as if they had not been; then His justice will be satisfied.\nHe formed man out of the dust of the earth, and the disobedient and\nunholy will be consumed by fire and return to dust again. I saw that\nthe benevolence and compassion of God in this matter should lead\nall to admire His character and to adore His holy name. After the\nwicked are destroyed from off the earth, all the heavenly host will\nsay, \u201cAmen!\u201d\nSatan looks with great satisfaction upon those who profess the\nname of Christ, yet closely adhere to the delusions which he himself\nhas originated. His work is still to devise new delusions, and his\npower and art in this direction continually increase. He led his\n214 Early Writings\nrepresentatives, the popes and the priests, to exalt themselves, and\nto stir up the people to bitterly persecute and destroy those who[222]\nwere not willing to accept his delusions. Oh, the sufferings and\nagony which the precious followers of Christ were made to endure!\nAngels have kept a faithful record of it all. Satan and his evil angels\nexultingly told the angels who ministered to these suffering saints\nthat they were all to be killed, so that there would not be left a true\nChristian upon the earth. I saw that the church of God was then pure.\nThere was no danger of men with corrupt hearts coming into it; for\nthe true Christian, who dared to declare his faith, was in danger of\nthe rack, the stake, and every torture which Satan and his evil angels\ncould invent or inspire in the mind of man.\nThe Reformation\nNotwithstanding all the persecution of the saints, living witnesses\nfor God\u2019s truth were raised up on every hand. Angels of the Lord\nwere doing the work committed to their trust. They were searching\nin the darkest places and selecting out of the darkness men who were\nhonest in heart. These were all buried up in error, yet God called\nthem, as He did Saul, to be chosen vessels to bear His truth and\nraise their voices against the sins of His professed people. Angels\nof God moved upon the hearts of Martin Luther, Melanchthon, and\nothers in different places, and caused them to thirst for the living\ntestimony of the Word of God. The enemy had come in like a flood,\nand the standard must be raised against him. Luther was the one\nchosen to breast the storm, stand up against the ire of a fallen church,\nand strengthen the few who were faithful to their holy profession.\nHe was ever fearful of offending God. He tried through works to\nobtain His favor, but was not satisfied until a gleam of light from [223]\nheaven drove the darkness from his mind and led him to trust, not in\nworks, but in the merits of the blood of Christ. He could then come\nto God for himself, not through popes or confessors, but through\nJesus Christ alone.\nOh, how precious to Luther was this new and glorious light\nwhich had dawned upon his dark understanding and driven away his\nsuperstition! He prized it higher than the richest earthly treasure.\nThe Word of God was new. Everything was changed. The book\nhe had dreaded because he could not see beauty in it, was now\nlife, eternal life, to him. It was his joy, his consolation, his blessed\nteacher. Nothing could induce him to leave its study. He had feared\ndeath; but as he read the Word of God, all his terrors disappeared,\nand he admired the character of God and loved Him. He searched\nthe Bible for himself and feasted upon the rich treasures it contained;\nthen he searched it for the church. He was disgusted with the sins\nof those in whom he had trusted for salvation, and as he saw many\nothers enshrouded in the same darkness which had covered him, he\n215\n216 Early Writings\nanxiously sought an opportunity to point them to the Lamb of God,\nwho alone taketh away the sin of the world.\nRaising his voice against the errors and sins of the papal church,\nhe earnestly endeavored to break the chain of darkness which was\nconfining thousands and causing them to trust in works for salvation.\nHe longed to be enabled to open to their minds the true riches of\nthe grace of God and the excellence of salvation obtained through\nJesus Christ. In the power of the Holy Spirit he cried out against the\nexisting sins of the leaders of the church; and as he met the storm\nof opposition from the priests, his courage failed not; for he firmly\nrelied upon the strong arm of God, and confidently trusted in Him\nfor victory. As he pushed the battle closer and closer, the rage of[224]\nthe priests was kindled still hotter against him. They did not wish to\nbe reformed. They chose to be left in ease, in wanton pleasure, in\nwickedness; and they desired the church also to be kept in darkness.\nI saw that Luther was ardent and zealous, fearless and bold, in\nreproving sin and advocating the truth. He cared not for wicked\nmen or devils; he knew that he had One with him mightier than they\nall. Luther possessed zeal, courage, and boldness, and at times was\nin danger of going to extremes. But God raised up Melanchthon,\nwho was just the opposite in character, to aid Luther in carrying on\nthe work of reformation. Melanchthon was timid, fearful, cautious,\nand possessed great patience. He was greatly beloved of God. His\nknowledge of the Scriptures was great, and his judgment and wisdom\nexcellent. His love for the cause of God was equal to Luther\u2019s. The\nhearts of these men the Lord knit together; they were inseparable\nfriends. Luther was a great help to Melanchthon when in danger of\nbeing fearful and slow, and Melanchthon in turn was a great help to\nLuther when in danger of moving too fast. Melanchthon\u2019s farseeing\ncaution often averted trouble which would have come upon the cause\nhad the work been left alone to Luther; and ofttimes the work would\nnot have been pushed forward had it been left to Melanchthon alone.\nI was shown the wisdom of God in choosing these two men to carry\non the work of reformation.\nI was then carried back to the days of the apostles and saw\nthat God chose as companions an ardent, zealous Peter and a mild,\npatient John. Sometimes Peter was impetuous, and often when this\nwas the case the beloved disciple would check him. This, however,\nReformation 217\ndid not reform him. But after he had denied his Lord, repented, and\nbeen converted, all he needed to check his ardor and zeal was a mild [225]\ncaution from John. The cause of Christ would often have suffered\nhad it been left to John alone. Peter\u2019s zeal was needed. His boldness\nand energy often delivered them from difficulty and silenced their\nenemies. John was winning. He gained many to the cause of Christ\nby his patient forbearance and deep devotedness.\nGod raised up men to cry against the existing sins of the papal\nchurch and carry forward the Reformation. Satan sought to destroy\nthese living witnesses; but the Lord made a hedge about them. Some,\nfor the glory of His name, were permitted to seal with their blood\nthe testimony they had borne; but there were other powerful men,\nlike Luther and Melanchthon, who could best glorify God by living\nand exposing the sins of priests, popes, and kings. These trembled\nbefore the voice of Luther, and his fellow laborers. Through those\nchosen men, rays of light began to scatter the darkness, and very\nmany joyfully received the light and walked in it. And when one\nwitness was slain, two or more were raised up to take his place.\nBut Satan was not satisfied. He could only have power over the\nbody. He could not make believers yield their faith and hope. And\neven in death they triumphed with a bright hope of immortality at\nthe resurrection of the just. They had more than mortal energy. They\ndared not sleep for a moment, but kept the Christian armor girded\nabout them, prepared for a conflict, not merely with spiritual foes,\nbut with Satan in the form of men whose constant cry was, \u201cGive\nup your faith, or die.\u201d These few Christians were strong in God, and\nmore precious in His sight than half a world who bear the name\nof Christ, and yet are cowards in His cause. While the church was\npersecuted, its members were united and loving; they were strong\nin God. Sinners were not permitted to unite with the church. Those [226]\nonly who are willing to forsake all for Christ could be His disciples.\nThese loved to be poor, humble, and Christlike.\nThe Church and the World United\nAfter this I saw Satan consulting with his angels and considering\nwhat they had gained. True, they had, through fear of death, kept\nsome timid souls from embracing the truth; but many, even of the\nmost timid, had received the truth, and thereupon their fears and\ntimidity immediately left them. As these witnessed the death of their\nbrethren and beheld their firmness and patience, they knew that God\nand angels assisted them to endure such sufferings, and they grew\nbold and fearless. And when called to yield their own lives, they\nmaintained their faith with such patience and firmness as caused\neven their murderers to tremble. Satan and his angels decided that\nthere was a more successful way to destroy souls, one that would be\nmore certain in the end. Although Christians were made to suffer,\ntheir steadfastness, and the bright hope that cheered them, caused\nthe weakest to grow strong and enabled them to approach the rack\nand the flames undaunted. They imitated the noble bearing of Christ\nwhen before His murderers, and by their constancy and the glory\nof God which rested upon them, they convinced many others of the\ntruth.\nSatan therefore decided that he must come in a milder form.\nHe had already corrupted the doctrines of the Bible, and traditions\nwhich were to ruin millions were taking deep root. Restraining his\nhate, he decided not to urge on his subjects to such bitter persecution,\nbut lead the church to contend for various traditions, instead of for\nthe faith once delivered to the saints. As he prevailed on the church[227]\nto receive favors and honors from the world, under the pretense of\nreceiving benefits, she began to lose favor with God. Shunning to\ndeclare the straight truths which shut out the lovers of pleasure and\nfriends of the world, she gradually lost her power.\nThe church is not now the separate and peculiar people she was\nwhen the fires of persecution were kindled against her. How is the\ngold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! I saw that\nif the church had always retained her peculiar, holy character, the\n218\nChurch and the World United 219\npower of the Holy Spirit which was imparted to the disciples would\nstill be with her. The sick would be healed, devils would be rebuked\nand cast out, and she would be mighty and a terror to her enemies.\nI saw a very large company professing the name of Christ, but\nGod did not recognize them as His. He had no pleasure in them.\nSatan seemed to assume a religious character and was very willing\nthat the people should think they were Christians. He was even\nanxious that they should believe in Jesus, His crucifixion, and His\nresurrection. Satan and his angels fully believe all this themselves,\nand tremble. But if this faith does not provoke to good works, and\nlead those who profess it to imitate the self-denying life of Christ,\nSatan is not disturbed; for they merely assume the Christian name,\nwhile their hearts are still carnal, and he can use them in his service\neven better than if they made no profession. Hiding their deformity\nunder the name of Christian, they pass along with their unsanctified\nnatures, and their evil passions unsubdued. This gives occasion for\nthe unbeliever to reproach Christ with their imperfections, and causes\nthose who do possess pure and undefiled religion to be brought into\ndisrepute.\nThe ministers preach smooth things to suit carnal professors. [228]\nThey dare not preach Jesus and the cutting truths of the Bible; for if\nthey should, these carnal professors would not remain in the church.\nBut as many of them are wealthy, they must be retained, although\nthey are no more fit to be there than Satan and his angels. This\nis just as Satan would have it. The religion of Jesus is made to\nappear popular and honorable in the eyes of the world. The people\nare told that those who profess religion will be more honored by\nthe world. Such teachings differ very widely from the teachings of\nChrist. His doctrine and the world could not be at peace. Those\nwho followed Him had to renounce the world. These smooth things\noriginated with Satan and his angels. They formed the plan, and\nnominal professors carried it out. Pleasing fables were taught and\nreadily received, and hypocrites and open sinners united with the\nchurch. If the truth had been preached in its purity, it would soon\nhave shut out this class. But there was no difference between the\nprofessed followers of Christ and the world. I saw that if the false\ncovering had been torn off from the members of the churches, there\nwould have been revealed such iniquity, vileness, and corruption\n220 Early Writings\nthat the most diffident child of God would have had no hesitancy in\ncalling these professed Christians by their right name, children of\ntheir father, the devil; for his works they did.\nJesus and all the heavenly host looked with disgust upon the\nscene; yet God had a message for the church that was sacred and\nimportant. If received, it would make a thorough reformation in the\nchurch, revive the living testimony that would purge out hypocrites\nand sinners, and bring the church again into favor with God.\nWilliam Miller [229]\n[See Appendix.]\nGod sent His angel to move upon the heart of a farmer who had\nnot believed the Bible, to lead him to search the prophecies. Angels\nof God repeatedly visited that chosen one, to guide his mind and\nopen to his understanding prophecies which had ever been dark to\nGod\u2019s people. The commencement of the chain of truth was given\nto him, and he was led on to search for link after link, until he\nlooked with wonder and admiration upon the Word of God. He saw\nthere a perfect chain of truth. That Word which he had regarded as\nuninspired now opened before his vision in its beauty and glory. He\nsaw that one portion of Scripture explains another, and when one\npassage was closed to his understanding, he found in another part of\nthe Word that which explained it. He regarded the sacred Word of\nGod with joy and with the deepest respect and awe.\nAs he followed down the prophecies, he saw that the inhabitants\nof the earth were living in the closing scenes of this world\u2019s history,\nyet they knew it not. He looked at the churches and saw that they\nwere corrupt; they had taken their affections from Jesus and placed\nthem on the world; they were seeking for worldly honor, instead of\nthat honor which cometh from above; grasping for worldly riches,\ninstead of laying up their treasure in heaven. He could see hypocrisy,\ndarkness, and death everywhere. His spirit was stirred within him.\nGod called him to leave his farm, as He called Elisha to leave his\noxen and the field of his labor to follow Elijah. With trembling,\nWilliam Miller began to unfold to the people the mysteries of the\nkingdom of God, carrying his hearers down through the prophecies\nto the second advent of Christ. With every effort he gained strength. [230]\nAs John the Baptist heralded the first advent of Jesus and prepared\nthe way for His coming, so William Miller and those who joined\nwith him proclaimed the second advent of the Son of God.\n221\n222 Early Writings\nI was carried back to the days of the disciples and was shown\nthat God had a special work for the beloved John to accomplish.\nSatan was determined to hinder this work, and he led on his servants\nto destroy John. But God sent His angel and wonderfully preserved\nhim. All who witnessed the great power of God manifested in the\ndeliverance of John were astonished, and many were convinced that\nGod was with him, and that the testimony which he bore concerning\nJesus was correct. Those who sought to destroy him were afraid\nto attempt again to take his life, and he was permitted to suffer on\nfor Jesus. He was falsely accused by his enemies and was shortly\nbanished to a lonely island, where the Lord sent His angel to reveal\nto him events which were to take place upon the earth and the state of\nthe church down to the end\u2014her backslidings and the position which\nshe should occupy if she would please God and finally overcome.\nThe angel from heaven came to John in majesty, his countenance\nbeaming with the excellent glory of God. He revealed to John\nscenes of deep and thrilling interest in the history of the church of\nGod and brought before him the perilous conflicts which Christ\u2019s\nfollowers were to endure. John saw them passing through fiery trials,\nmade white and tried, and, finally, victorious overcomers, gloriously\nsaved in the kingdom of God. The countenance of the angel grew\nradiant with joy and was exceeding glorious, as he showed John\nthe final triumph of the church of God. As the apostle beheld the\nfinal deliverance of the church, he was carried away with the glory\nof the scene and with deep reverence and awe fell at the feet of[231]\nthe angel to worship him. The heavenly messenger instantly raised\nhim up and gently reproved him, saying, \u201cSee thou do it not: I\nam thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony\nof Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of\nprophecy.\u201d The angel then showed John the heavenly city with all its\nsplendor and dazzling glory, and he, enraptured and overwhelmed,\nand forgetful of the former reproof of the angel, again fell to worship\nat his feet. Again the gentle reproof was given, \u201cSee thou do it not\nfor I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of\nthem which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.\u201d\nPreachers and people have looked upon the book of Revelation as\nmysterious and of less importance than other portions of the Sacred\nScriptures. But I saw that this book is indeed a revelation given\nWilliam Miller 223\nfor the especial benefit of those who should live in the last days, to\nguide them in ascertaining their true position and their duty. God\ndirected the mind of William Miller to the prophecies and gave him\ngreat light upon the book of Revelation.\nIf Daniel\u2019s visions had been understood, the people could better\nhave understood the visions of John. But at the right time, God\nmoved upon His chosen servant, who, with clearness and in the\npower of the Holy Spirit, opened the prophecies and showed the\nharmony of the visions of Daniel and John and other portions of the\nBible, and pressed home upon the hearts of the people the sacred,\nfearful warnings of the Word to prepare for the coming of the Son\nof man. Deep and solemn conviction rested upon the minds of those\nwho heard him, and ministers and people, sinners and infidels, turned\nto the Lord and sought a preparation to stand in the judgment.\nAngels of God accompanied William Miller in his mission. He [232]\nwas firm and undaunted, fearlessly proclaiming the message com-\nmitted to his trust. A world lying in wickedness and a cold, worldly\nchurch were enough to call into action all his energies and lead him\nwillingly to endure toil, privation, and suffering. Although opposed\nby professed Christians and the world, and buffeted by Satan and\nhis angels, he ceased not to preach the everlasting gospel to crowds\nwherever he was invited, sounding far and near the cry, \u201cFear God,\nand give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.\u201d\nThe First Angel\u2019s Message\n[See Appendix.]\nI saw that God was in the proclamation of the time in 1843. It\nwas His design to arouse the people and bring them to a testing point,\nwhere they should decide for or against the truth. Ministers were\nconvinced of the correctness of the positions taken on the prophetic\nperiods, and some renounced their pride, and left their salaries and\ntheir churches to go forth from place to place to give the message.\nBut as the message from heaven could find a place in the hearts\nof but few of the professed ministers of Christ, the work was laid\nupon many who were not preachers. Some left their fields to sound\nthe message, while others were called from their shops and their\nmerchandise. And even some professional men were compelled to\nleave their professions to engage in the unpopular work of giving\nthe first angel\u2019s message.\nMinisters laid aside their sectarian views and feelings and united\nin proclaiming the coming of Jesus. Wherever the message was\ngiven, it moved the people. Sinners repented, wept, and prayed for\nforgiveness, and those whose lives had been marked with dishonesty[233]\nwere anxious to make restitution. Parents felt the deepest solicitude\nfor their children. Those who received the message labored with\ntheir unconverted friends and relatives, and with their souls bowed\nwith the weight of the solemn message, warned and entreated them\nto prepare for the coming of the Son of man. Those cases were\nmost hardened that would not yield to such a weight of evidence\nset home by heartfelt warnings. This soul-purifying work led the\naffections away from worldly things to a consecration never before\nexperienced.\nThousands were led to embrace the truth preached by William\nMiller, and servants of God were raised up in the spirit and power\nof Elijah to proclaim the message. Like John, the forerunner of\nJesus, those who preached this solemn message felt compelled to\n224\nFirst Angel\u2019s Message 225\nlay the ax at the root of the tree, and call upon men to bring forth\nfruits meet for repentance. Their testimony was calculated to arouse\nand powerfully affect the churches and manifest their real character.\nAnd as the solemn warning to flee from the wrath to come was\nsounded, many who were united with the churches received the\nhealing message; they saw their backslidings, and with bitter tears of\nrepentance and deep agony of soul, humbled themselves before God.\nAnd as the Spirit of God rested upon them, they helped to sound the\ncry, \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment\nis come.\u201d\nThe preaching of definite time called forth great opposition from\nall classes, from the minister in the pulpit down to the most reckless,\nheaven-daring sinner. \u201cNo man knoweth the day nor the hour,\u201d was\nheard from the hypocritical minister and the bold scoffer. Neither\nwould be instructed and corrected by those who were pointing to\nthe year when they believed the prophetic periods would run out, [234]\nand to the signs which showed Christ near, even at the doors. Many\nshepherds of the flock, who professed to love Jesus, said that they\nhad no opposition to the preaching of Christ\u2019s coming, but they\nobjected to the definite time. God\u2019s all-seeing eye read their hearts.\nThey did not love Jesus near. They knew that their unchristian lives\nwould not stand the test, for they were not walking in the humble\npath marked out by Him. These false shepherds stood in the way of\nthe work of God. The truth spoken in its convincing power aroused\nthe people, and like the jailer, they began to inquire, \u201cWhat must I do\nto be saved?\u201d But these shepherds stepped in between the truth and\nthe people, and preached smooth things to lead them from the truth.\nThey united with Satan and his angels, crying, \u201cPeace, peace,\u201d when\nthere was no peace. Those who loved their ease and were content\nwith their distance from God would not be aroused from their carnal\nsecurity. I saw that angels of God marked it all; the garments of\nthose unconsecrated shepherds were covered with the blood of souls.\nMinisters who would not accept this saving message themselves\nhindered those who would have received it. The blood of souls is\nupon them. Preachers and people joined to oppose this message from\nheaven and to persecute William Miller and those who united with\nhim in the work. Falsehoods were circulated to injure his influence;\nand at different times after he had plainly declared the counsel of\n226 Early Writings\nGod, applying cutting truths to the hearts of his hearers, great rage\nwas kindled against him, and as he left the place of meeting, some\nwaylaid him in order to take his life. But angels of God were sent to\nprotect him, and they led him safely away from the angry mob. His\nwork was not yet finished.\nThe most devoted gladly received the message. They knew that[235]\nit was from God and that it was delivered at the right time. Angels\nwere watching with the deepest interest the result of the heavenly\nmessage, and when the churches turned from and rejected it, they in\nsadness consulted with Jesus. He turned His face from the churches\nand bade His angels faithfully watch over the precious ones who\ndid not reject the testimony, for another light was yet to shine upon\nthem.\nI saw that if professed Christians had loved their Saviour\u2019s ap-\npearing, if they had placed their affections on Him, and had felt that\nthere was none upon the earth to be compared with Him, they would\nhave hailed with joy the first intimation of His coming. But the\ndislike which they manifested, as they heard of their Lord\u2019s coming,\nwas a decided proof that they did not love Him. Satan and his angels\ntriumphed, and cast it in the face of Christ and His holy angels, that\nHis professed people had so little love for Jesus that they did not\ndesire His second appearing.\nI saw the people of God joyful in expectation, looking for their\nLord. But God designed to prove them. His hand covered a mistake\nin the reckoning of the prophetic periods. Those who were looking\nfor their Lord did not discover this mistake, and the most learned\nmen who opposed the time also failed to see it. God designed that\nHis people should meet with a disappointment. The time passed, and\nthose who had looked with joyful expectation for their Saviour were\nsad and disheartened, while those who had not loved the appearing\nof Jesus, but embraced the message through fear, were pleased that\nHe did not come at the time of expectation. Their profession had\nnot affected the heart and purified the life. The passing of the time\nwas well calculated to reveal such hearts. They were the first to turn[236]\nand ridicule the sorrowful, disappointed ones who really loved the\nappearing of their Saviour. I saw the wisdom of God in proving His\npeople and giving them a searching test to discover those who would\nshrink and turn back in the hour of trial.\nFirst Angel\u2019s Message 227\nJesus and all the heavenly host looked with sympathy and love\nupon those who had with sweet expectation longed to see Him whom\ntheir souls loved. Angels were hovering around them, to sustain\nthem in the hour of their trial. Those who had neglected to receive\nthe heavenly message were left in darkness, and God\u2019s anger was\nkindled against them, because they would not receive the light which\nHe had sent them from heaven. Those faithful, disappointed ones,\nwho could not understand why their Lord did not come, were not\nleft in darkness. Again they were led to their Bibles to search the\nprophetic periods. The hand of the Lord was removed from the\nfigures, and the mistake was explained. They saw that the prophetic\nperiods reached to 1844, and that the same evidence which they had\npresented to show that the prophetic periods closed in 1843, proved\nthat they would terminate in 1844. Light from the Word of God\nshone upon their position, and they discovered a tarrying time\u2014\n\u201cThough it [the vision] tarry, wait for it.\u201d In their love for Christ\u2019s\nimmediate coming, they had overlooked the tarrying of the vision,\nwhich was calculated to manifest the true waiting ones. Again they\nhad a point of time. Yet I saw that many of them could not rise above\ntheir severe disappointment to possess that degree of zeal and energy\nwhich had marked their faith in 1843.\nSatan and his angels triumphed over them, and those who would\nnot receive the message congratulated themselves upon their farsee-\ning judgment and wisdom in not receiving the delusion, as they [237]\ncalled it. They did not realize that they were rejecting the counsel\nof God against themselves, and were working in union with Satan\nand his angels to perplex God\u2019s people, who were living out the\nheaven-sent message.\nThe believers in this message were oppressed in the churches.\nFor a time, those who would not receive the message were restrained\nby fear from acting out the sentiments of their hearts; but the passing\nof the time revealed their true feelings. They wished to silence the\ntestimony which the waiting ones felt compelled to bear, that the\nprophetic periods extended to 1844. With clearness the believers\nexplained their mistake and gave the reasons why they expected\ntheir Lord in 1844. Their opposers could bring no arguments against\nthe powerful reasons offered. Yet the anger of the churches was\nkindled; they were determined not to listen to evidence, and to shut\n228 Early Writings\nthe testimony out of the churches, so the others could not hear it.\nThose who dared not withhold from others the light which God had\ngiven them, were shut out of the churches; but Jesus was with them,\nand they were joyful in the light of His countenance. They were\nprepared to receive the message of the second angel.\nThe Second Angel\u2019s Message\n[see Appendix.]\nAs the churches refused to receive the first angel\u2019s message, they\nrejected the light from heaven and fell from the favor of God. They\ntrusted to their own strength, and by opposing the first message\nplaced themselves where they could not see the light of the second\nangel\u2019s message. But the beloved of God, who were oppressed,\naccepted the message, \u201cBabylon is fallen,\u201d and left the churches.\nNear the close of the second angel\u2019s message, [see Appendix.] I [238]\nsaw a great light from heaven shining upon the people of God. The\nrays of this light seemed bright as the sun. And I heard the voices of\nangels crying, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet\nHim!\u201d\nThis was the midnight cry, which was to give power to the\nsecond angel\u2019s message. Angels were sent from heaven to arouse the\ndiscouraged saints and prepare them for the great work before them.\nThe most talented men were not the first to receive this message.\nAngels were sent to the humble, devoted ones, and constrained them\nto raise the cry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet\nHim!\u201d Those entrusted with the cry made haste, and in the power of\nthe Holy Spirit sounded the message, and aroused their discouraged\nbrethren. This work did not stand in the wisdom and learning of\nmen, but in the power of God, and His saints who heard the cry\ncould not resist it. The most spiritual received this message first, and\nthose who had formerly led in the work were the last to receive and\nhelp swell the cry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to\nmeet Him!\u201d\nIn every part of the land, light was given upon the second angel\u2019s\nmessage, and the cry melted the hearts of thousands. It went from\ncity to city, and from village to village, until the waiting people of\nGod were fully aroused. In many churches the message was not\npermitted to be given, and a large company who had the living testi-\n229\n230 Early Writings\nmony left these fallen churches. A mighty work was accomplished\nby the midnight cry. The message was heart-searching, leading the\nbelievers to seek a living experience for themselves. They knew that\nthey could not lean upon one another.\nThe saints anxiously waited for their Lord with fasting, watching,\nand almost constant prayer. Even some sinners looked forward to the\ntime with terror; but the great mass manifested the spirit of Satan in[239]\ntheir opposition to the message. They mocked and scoffed, repeating\neverywhere, \u201cNo man knoweth the day nor the hour.\u201d Evil angels\nurged them on to harden their hearts and to reject every ray of light\nfrom heaven, that they might be fastened in the snare of Satan. Many\nwho professed to be looking for Christ had no part in the work of the\nmessage. The glory of God which they had witnessed, the humility\nand deep devotion of the waiting ones, and the overwhelming weight\nof evidence, caused them to profess to receive the truth; but they\nhad not been converted; they were not ready for the coming of their\nLord.\nA spirit of solemn and earnest prayer was everywhere felt by\nthe saints. A holy solemnity was resting upon them. Angels were\nwatching with the deepest interest the effect of the message, and\nwere elevating those who received it, and drawing them from earthly\nthings to obtain large supplies from salvation\u2019s fountain. God\u2019s\npeople were then accepted of Him. Jesus looked upon them with\npleasure, for His image was reflected in them. They had made a\nfull sacrifice, an entire consecration, and expected to be changed to\nimmortality. But they were destined again to be sadly disappointed.\nThe time to which they looked, expecting deliverance, passed; they\nwere still upon the earth, and the effects of the curse never seemed\nmore visible. They had placed their affections on heaven, and in\nsweet anticipation had tasted immortal deliverance; but their hopes\nwere not realized.\nThe fear that had rested upon many of the people did not at once\ndisappear; they did not immediately triumph over the disappointed\nones. But as no visible tokens of God\u2019s wrath appeared, they recov-\nered from the fear which they had felt and commenced their ridicule\nand scoffing. The people of God were again proved and tested. The[240]\nworld laughed and mocked and reproached them; and those who\nhad believed without a doubt that Jesus would ere then have come to\nSecond Angel\u2019s Message 231\nraise the dead, and change the living saints, and take the kingdom, to\npossess it forever, felt as did the disciples at the sepulcher of Christ,\n\u201cThey have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have\nlaid Him.\u201d\nThe Advent Movement Illustrated\nI saw a number of companies that seemed to be bound together\nby cords. Many in these companies were in total darkness; their\neyes were directed downward to the earth, and there seemed to be\nno connection between them and Jesus. But scattered through these\ndifferent companies were persons whose countenances looked light,\nand whose eyes were raised to heaven. Beams of light from Jesus,\nlike rays from the sun, were imparted to them. An angel bade me\nlook carefully, and I saw an angel watching over every one of those\nwho had a ray of light, while evil angels surrounded those who were\nin darkness. I heard the voice of an angel cry, \u201cFear God, and give\nglory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.\u201d\nA glorious light then rested down upon these companies, to\nenlighten all who would receive it. Some of those who were in\ndarkness received the light and rejoiced. Others resisted the light\nfrom heaven, saying that it was sent to lead them astray. The light\npassed away from them, and they were left in darkness. Those who\nhad received the light from Jesus joyfully cherished the increase of\nprecious light which was shed upon them. Their faces beamed with\nholy joy, while their gaze was directed upward to Jesus with intense[241]\ninterest, and their voices were heard in harmony with the voice of\nthe angel, \u201cFear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His\njudgment is come.\u201d As they raised this cry, I saw those who were\nin darkness thrusting them with side and with shoulder. Then many\nwho cherished the sacred light, broke the cords which confined them\nand stood out separated from those companies. As they were doing\nthis, men belonging to the different companies and revered by them\npassed through, some with pleasing words, and others with wrathful\nlooks and threatening gestures, and fastened the cords which were\nweakening. These men were constantly saying, \u201cGod is with us.\nWe stand in the light. We have the truth.\u201d I inquired who these men\nwere, and was told that they were ministers and leading men who\n232\nAdvent Movement Illustrated 233\nhad rejected the light themselves, and were unwilling that others\nshould receive it.\nI saw those who cherished the light looking upward with ardent\ndesire, expecting Jesus to come and take them to Himself. Soon a\ncloud passed over them, and their faces were sorrowful. I inquired\nthe cause of this cloud and was shown that it was their disappoint-\nment. The time when they expected their Saviour had passed, and\nJesus had not come. As discouragement settled upon the waiting\nones, the ministers and leading men whom I had before noticed,\nrejoiced, and all those who had rejected the light triumphed greatly,\nwhile Satan and his evil angels also exulted.\nThen I heard the voice of another angel saying, \u201cBabylon is\nfallen, is fallen!\u201d A light shone upon those desponding ones, and\nwith ardent desires for His appearing, they again fixed their eyes\nupon Jesus. I saw a number of angels conversing with the one who\nhad cried, \u201cBabylon is fallen,\u201d and these united with him in the [242]\ncry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\u201d The\nmusical voices of these angels seemed to reach everywhere. An\nexceedingly bright and glorious light shone around those who had\ncherished the light which had been imparted to them. Their faces\nshone with excellent glory, and they united with the angels in the\ncry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh.\u201d As they harmoniously raised\nthe cry among the different companies, those who rejected the light\npushed them and with angry looks scorned and derided them. But\nangels of God wafted their wings over the persecuted ones, while\nSatan and his angels were seeking to press their darkness around\nthem, to lead them to reject the light from heaven.\nThen I heard a voice saying to those who had been pushed and\nderided, \u201cCome out from among them, and touch not the unclean.\u201d\nIn obedience to this voice, a large number broke the cords which\nbound them, and leaving the companies that were in darkness, joined\nthose who had previously gained their freedom, and joyfully united\ntheir voices with them. I heard the voice of earnest, agonizing prayer\nfrom a few who still remained with the companies that were in\ndarkness. The ministers and leading men were passing around in\nthese different companies, fastening the cords more firmly; but still\nI heard this voice of earnest prayer. Then I saw those who had been\npraying reach out their hands for help toward the united company\n234 Early Writings\nwho were free, rejoicing in God. The answer from them, as they\nearnestly looked to heaven, and pointed upward, was, \u201cCome out\nfrom among them, and be separate.\u201d I saw individuals struggling\nfor freedom, and at last they broke the cords that bound them. They\nresisted the efforts which were made to fasten the cords tighter and\nrefused to heed the repeated assertions: \u201cGod is with us.\u201d \u201cWe have\nthe truth with us.\u201d\nPersons were continually leaving the companies that were in[243]\ndarkness and joining the free company, who appeared to be in an\nopen field raised above the earth. Their gaze was directed upward,\nthe glory of God rested upon them, and they joyfully shouted His\npraise. They were closely united and seemed to be wrapped in the\nlight of heaven. Around this company were some who came under\nthe influence of the light, but who were not particularly united to\nthe company. All who cherished the light shed upon them were\ngazing upward with intense interest, and Jesus looked upon them\nwith sweet approbation. They expected Him to come and longed for\nHis appearing. They did not cast one lingering look to earth. But\nagain a cloud settled upon the waiting ones, and I saw them turn\ntheir weary eyes downward. I inquired the cause of this change.\nSaid my accompanying angel, \u201cThey are again disappointed in their\nexpectations. Jesus cannot yet come to earth. They must endure\ngreater trials for His sake. They must give up errors and traditions\nreceived from men and turn wholly to God and His Word. They\nmust be purified, made white, and tried. Those who endure that\nbitter trial will obtain an eternal victory.\u201d\nJesus did not come to the earth as the waiting, joyful company\nexpected, to cleanse the sanctuary by purifying the earth by fire. I\nsaw that they were correct in their reckoning of the prophetic pe-\nriods; prophetic time closed in 1844, and Jesus entered the most\nholy place to cleanse the sanctuary at the ending of the days. Their\nmistake consisted in not understanding what the sanctuary was and\nthe nature of its cleansing. As I looked again at the waiting, disap-\npointed company, they appeared sad. They carefully examined the\nevidences of their faith and followed down through the reckoning of\nthe prophetic periods, but could discover no mistake. The time had[244]\nbeen fulfilled, but where was their Saviour? They had lost Him.\nAdvent Movement Illustrated 235\nI was shown the disappointment of the disciples as they came\nto the sepulcher and found not the body of Jesus. Mary said, \u201cThey\nhave taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid\nHim.\u201d Angels told the sorrowing disciples that their Lord had risen,\nand would go before them into Galilee.\nIn like manner I saw that Jesus regarded with the deepest com-\npassion the disappointed ones who had waited for His coming; and\nHe sent His angels to direct their minds that they might follow Him\nwhere He was. He showed them that this earth is not the sanctuary,\nbut that He must enter the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary\nto make an atonement for His people and to receive the kingdom\nfrom His Father, and that He would then return to the earth and take\nthem to dwell with Him forever. The disappointment of the first\ndisciples well represents the disappointment of those who expected\ntheir Lord in 1844.\nI was carried back to the time when Christ rode triumphantly\ninto Jerusalem. The joyful disciples believed that He was then to\ntake the kingdom and reign a temporal prince. They followed their\nKing with high hopes. They cut down the beautiful palm branches,\nand took off their outer garments, and with enthusiastic zeal spread\nthem in the way; and some went before, and others followed, crying,\n\u201cHosanna to the Son of David: Blessed is He that cometh in the\nname of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.\u201d The excitement disturbed\nthe Pharisees, and they wished Jesus to rebuke His disciples. But\nHe said unto them, \u201cIf these should hold their peace, the stones\nwould immediately cry out.\u201d The prophecy of Zechariah 9:9 must be\nfulfilled; yet the disciples were doomed to a bitter disappointment. In [245]\na few days they followed Jesus to Calvary, and beheld Him bleeding\nand mangled upon the cruel cross. They witnessed His agonizing\ndeath and laid Him in the tomb. Their hearts sank with grief; their\nexpectations were not realized in a single particular, and their hopes\ndied with Jesus. But as He arose from the dead and appeared to His\nsorrowing disciples, their hopes revived. They had found Him again.\nI saw that the disappointment of those who believed in the com-\ning of the Lord in 1844 was not equal to the disappointment of the\nfirst disciples. Prophecy was fulfilled in the first and second angels\u2019\nmessages. They were given at the right time and accomplished the\nwork which God designed to accomplish by them.\nAnother Illustration\nI was shown the interest which all heaven had taken in the work\ngoing on upon the earth. Jesus commissioned a mighty angel to\ndescend and warn the inhabitants of the earth to prepare for His\nsecond appearing. As the angel left the presence of Jesus in heaven,\nan exceedingly bright and glorious light went before him. I was told\nthat his mission was to lighten the earth with his glory and warn\nman of the coming wrath of God. Multitudes received the light.\nSome of these seemed to be very solemn, while others were joyful\nand enraptured. All who received the light turned their faces toward\nheaven and glorified God. Though it was shed upon all, some merely\ncame under its influence, but did not heartily receive it. Many were\nfilled with great wrath. Ministers and people united with the vile\nand stoutly resisted the light shed by the mighty angel. But all who[246]\nreceived it withdrew from the world and were closely united with\none another.\nSatan and his angels were busily engaged in seeking to attract\nthe minds of as many as possible from the light. The company who\nrejected it were left in darkness. I saw the angel of God watching\nwith the deepest interest His professed people, to record the char-\nacter which they developed as the message of heavenly origin was\npresented to them. And as very many who professed love for Jesus\nturned from the heavenly message with scorn, derision, and hatred,\nan angel with a parchment in his hand made the shameful record. All\nheaven was filled with indignation that Jesus should be thus slighted\nby His professed followers.\nI saw the disappointment of the trusting ones, as they did not\nsee their Lord at the expected time. It had been God\u2019s purpose to\nconceal the future and to bring His people to a point of decision.\nWithout the preaching of definite time for the coming of Christ, the\nwork designed of God would not have been accomplished. Satan\nwas leading very many to look far in the future for the great events\nconnected with the judgment and the end of probation. It was nec-\n236\nAnother Illustration 237\nessary that the people be brought to seek earnestly for a present\npreparation.\nAs the time passed, those who had not fully received the light of\nthe angel united with those who had despised the message, and they\nturned upon the disappointed ones with ridicule. Angels marked the\nsituation of Christ\u2019s professed followers. The passing of the definite\ntime had tested and proved them, and very many were weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting. They loudly claimed to be Christians,\nyet in almost every particular failed to follow Christ. Satan exulted\nat the state of the professed followers of Jesus. He had them in his [247]\nsnare. He had led the majority to leave the straight path, and they\nwere attempting to climb up to heaven some other way. Angels saw\nthe pure and holy mixed up with sinners in Zion and with world-\nloving hypocrites. They had watched over the true disciples of\nJesus; but the corrupt were affecting the holy. Those whose hearts\nburned with an intense desire to see Jesus were forbidden by their\nprofessed brethren to speak of His coming. Angels viewed the scene\nand sympathized with the remnant who loved the appearing of their\nLord.\nAnother mighty angel was commissioned to descend to earth.\nJesus placed in his hand a writing, and as he came to the earth, he\ncried, \u201cBabylon is fallen, is fallen.\u201d Then I saw the disappointed\nones again raise their eyes to heaven, looking with faith and hope\nfor their Lord\u2019s appearing. But many seemed to remain in a stupid\nstate, as if asleep; yet I could see the trace of deep sorrow upon their\ncountenances. The disappointed ones saw from the Scriptures that\nthey were in the tarrying time, and that they must patiently wait the\nfulfillment of the vision. The same evidence which led them to look\nfor their Lord in 1843, led them to expect Him in 1844. Yet I saw\nthat the majority did not possess that energy which marked their\nfaith in 1843. Their disappointment had dampened their faith.\nAs the people of God united in the cry of the second angel,\nthe heavenly host marked with the deepest interest the effect of the\nmessage. They saw many who bore the name of Christians turn\nwith scorn and derision upon those who had been disappointed. As\nthe words fell from mocking lips, \u201cYou have not gone up yet!\u201d an\nangel wrote them. Said the angel, \u201cThey mock God.\u201d I was pointed\nback to a similar sin committed in ancient times. Elijah had been\n238 Early Writings\ntranslated to heaven, and his mantle had fallen upon Elisha. Then[248]\nwicked youth, who had learned from their parents to despise the\nman of God, followed Elisha, and mockingly cried, \u201cGo up, thou\nbald head; go up, thou bald head.\u201d In thus insulting His servant,\nthey insulted God and met their punishment then and there. In like\nmanner, those who have scoffed and mocked at the idea of the saints\u2019\ngoing up, will be visited with the wrath of God, and will be made to\nfeel that it is not a light thing to trifle with their Maker.\nJesus commissioned other angels to fly quickly to revive and\nstrengthen the drooping faith of His people and prepare them to\nunderstand the message of the second angel and the important move\nwhich was soon to be made in heaven. I saw these angels receive\ngreat power and light from Jesus and fly quickly to earth to fulfill\ntheir commission to aid the second angel in his work. A great light\nshone upon the people of God as the angels cried, \u201cBehold, the\nBridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\u201d Then I saw these\ndisappointed ones rise and in harmony with the second angel pro-\nclaim, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet Him.\u201d\nThe light from the angels penetrated the darkness everywhere. Satan\nand his angels sought to hinder this light from spreading and having\nits designed effect. They contended with the angels from heaven,\ntelling them that God had deceived the people, and that with all their\nlight and power they could not make the world believe that Christ\nwas coming. But notwithstanding Satan strove to hedge up the way\nand draw the minds of the people from the light, the angels of God\ncontinued their work.\nThose who received the light appeared very happy. They looked\nsteadfastly toward heaven and longed for the appearing of Jesus.\nSome were weeping and praying in great distress. Their eyes seemed[249]\nto be fixed upon themselves, and they dared not look upward. A light\nfrom heaven parted the darkness from them, and their eyes, which\nhad been fixed in despair upon themselves, were turned upward,\nwhile gratitude and holy joy were expressed upon every feature.\nJesus and all the angelic host looked with approbation upon the\nfaithful, waiting ones.\nThose who rejected and opposed the light of the first angel\u2019s\nmessage, lost the light of the second, and could not be benefited\nby the power and glory which attended the message, \u201cBehold, the\nAnother Illustration 239\nBridegroom cometh.\u201d Jesus turned from them with a frown; for they\nhad slighted and rejected Him. Those who received the message\nwere wrapped in a cloud of glory. They greatly feared to offend God,\nand waited and watched and prayed to know His will. I saw Satan\nand his angels seeking to shut this divine light from the people of\nGod; but as long as the waiting ones cherished the light and kept\ntheir eyes raised from earth to Jesus, Satan could have no power to\ndeprive them of its precious rays. The message given from heaven\nenraged Satan and his angels, and led those who professed to love\nJesus, but despised His coming, to scorn and deride the faithful,\ntrusting ones. But an angel marked every insult, every slight, every\nwrong, which the children of God received from their professed\nbrethren.\nVery many raised their voices to cry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom\ncometh!\u201d and left their brethren who did not love the appearing of\nJesus, and who would not suffer them to dwell upon His second\ncoming. I saw Jesus turn His face from those who rejected and\ndespised His coming, and then He bade angels lead His people out\nfrom among the unclean, lest they should be defiled. Those who\nwere obedient to the message stood out free and united. A holy light [250]\nshone upon them. They renounced the world, sacrificed their earthly\ninterests, gave up their earthly treasures, and directed their anxious\ngaze to heaven, expecting to see their loved Deliverer. A holy light\nbeamed upon their countenances, telling of the peace and joy which\nreigned within. Jesus bade His angels go and strengthen them, for\nthe hour of their trial drew on. I saw that these waiting ones were\nnot yet tried as they must be. They were not free from errors. And\nI saw the mercy and goodness of God in sending a warning to the\npeople of the earth, and repeated messages to lead them to a diligent\nsearching of heart, and study of the Scriptures, that they might divest\nthemselves of errors which have been handed down from the heathen\nand papists. Through these messages God has been bringing out His\npeople where He can work for them in greater power, and where\nthey can keep all His commandments.\nThe Sanctuary\nI was shown the grievous disappointment of the people of God\nthat they did not see Jesus at the expected time. They knew not\nwhy their Saviour did not come; for they could see no evidence that\nprophetic time had not ended. Said the angel, \u201cHas God\u2019s word\nfailed? Has God failed to fulfill His promises? No; He has fulfilled\nall that He promised. Jesus has risen up and shut the door of the\nholy place of the heavenly sanctuary and has opened a door into the\nmost holy place and entered in to cleanse the sanctuary. All who\nwait patiently shall understand the mystery. Man has erred; but there\nhas been no failure on the part of God. All was accomplished that\nGod promised; but man erroneously believed the earth to be the[251]\nsanctuary to be cleansed at the end of the prophetic periods. It is\nman\u2019s expectation, not the promise of God, that has failed.\u201d\nJesus sent His angels to direct the minds of the disappointed\nones to the most holy place, where He had gone to cleanse the\nsanctuary and make a special atonement for Israel. Jesus told the\nangels that all who found Him would understand the work which\nHe was to perform. I saw that while Jesus was in the most holy\nplace He would be married to the New Jerusalem; and after His\nwork should be accomplished in the holiest, He would descend to\nthe earth in kingly power and take to Himself the precious ones who\nhad patiently waited His return.\nI was shown what did take place in heaven at the close of the\nprophetic periods in 1844. As Jesus ended His ministration in the\nholy place and closed the door of that apartment, a great darkness\nsettled upon those who had heard and rejected the message of His\ncoming, and they lost sight of Him. Jesus then clothed Himself\nwith precious garments. Around the bottom of His robe was a bell\nand a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate. A breastplate of\ncurious work was suspended from His shoulders. As He moved,\nthis glittered like diamonds, magnifying letters which looked like\nnames written or engraved upon the breastplate. Upon His head was\n240\nSanctuary 241\nsomething which had the appearance of a crown. When fully attired,\nHe was surrounded by angels, and in a flaming chariot He passed\nwithin the second veil.\nI was then bidden to take notice of the two apartments of the\nheavenly sanctuary. The curtain, or door, was opened, and I was\npermitted to enter. In the first apartment I saw the candlestick with\nseven lamps, the table of shewbread, the altar of incense, and the\ncenser. All the furniture of this apartment looked like purest gold and [252]\nreflected the image of the one who entered the place. The curtain\nwhich separated the two apartments was of different colors and\nmaterial, with a beautiful border, in which were figures wrought of\ngold to represent angels. The veil was lifted, and I looked into the\nsecond apartment. I saw there an ark which had the appearance of\nbeing of the finest gold. As a border around the top of the ark, was\nmost beautiful work representing crowns. In the ark were tables of\nstone containing the ten commandments.\nTwo lovely cherubs, one on each end of the ark, stood with\ntheir wings outstretched above it, and touching each other above\nthe head of Jesus as He stood before the mercy seat. Their faces\nwere turned toward each other, and they looked downward to the\nark, representing all the angelic host looking with interest at the\nlaw of God. Between the cherubim was a golden censer, and as\nthe prayers of the saints, offered in faith, came up to Jesus, and\nHe presented them to His father, a cloud of fragrance arose from\nthe incense, looking like smoke of most beautiful colors. Above\nthe place where Jesus stood, before the ark, was exceedingly bright\nglory that I could not look upon; it appeared like the throne of God.\nAs the incense ascended to the Father, the excellent glory came from\nthe throne to Jesus, and from Him it was shed upon those whose\nprayers had come up like sweet incense. Light poured upon Jesus in\nrich abundance and overshadowed the mercy seat, and the train of\nglory filled the temple. I could not long look upon the surpassing\nbrightness. No language can describe it. I was overwhelmed and\nturned from the majesty and glory of the scene.\nI was also shown a sanctuary upon the earth containing two\napartments. It resembled the one in heaven, and I was told that it\nwas a figure of the heavenly. The furniture of the first apartment [253]\nof the earthly sanctuary was like that in the first apartment of the\n242 Early Writings\nheavenly. The veil was lifted, and I looked into the holy of holies\nand saw that the furniture was the same as in the most holy place of\nthe heavenly sanctuary. The priest ministered in both apartments of\nthe earthly. He went daily into the first apartment, but entered the\nmost holy only once a year, to cleanse it from the sins which had\nbeen conveyed there. I saw that Jesus ministered in both apartments\nof the heavenly sanctuary. The priests entered into the earthly with\nthe blood of an animal as an offering for sin. Christ entered into the\nheavenly sanctuary by the offering of His own blood. The earthly\npriests were removed by death; therefore they could not continue\nlong; but Jesus was a priest forever. Through the sacrifices and\nofferings brought to the earthly sanctuary, the children of Israel were\nto lay hold of the merits of a Saviour to come. And in the wisdom\nof God the particulars of this work were given us that we might,\nby looking to them, understand the work of Jesus in the heavenly\nsanctuary.\nAs Jesus died on Calvary, He cried, \u201cIt is finished,\u201d and the veil\nof the temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom. This\nwas to show that the services of the earthly sanctuary were forever\nfinished, and that God would no more meet with the priests in their\nearthly temple, to accept their sacrifices. The blood of Jesus was then\nshed, which was to be offered by Himself in the heavenly sanctuary.\nAs the priest entered the most holy once a year to cleanse the earthly\nsanctuary, so Jesus entered the most holy of the heavenly, at the end\nof the 2300 days of Daniel 8, in 1844, to make a final atonement for\nall who could be benefited by His mediation, and thus to cleanse the\nsanctuary.\nThe Third Angel\u2019s Message [254]\n[See Appendix.]\nAs the ministration of Jesus closed in the holy place, and He\npassed into the holiest, and stood before the ark containing the law\nof God, He sent another mighty angel with a third message to the\nworld. A parchment was placed in the angel\u2019s hand, and as he\ndescended to the earth in power and majesty, he proclaimed a fearful\nwarning, with the most terrible threatening ever borne to man. This\nmessage was designed to put the children of God upon their guard,\nby showing them the hour of temptation and anguish that was before\nthem. Said the angel, \u201cThey will be brought into close combat with\nthe beast and his image. Their only hope of eternal life is to remain\nsteadfast. Although their lives are at stake, they must hold fast the\ntruth.\u201d The third angel closes his message thus: \u201cHere is the patience\nof the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God,\nand the faith of Jesus.\u201d As he repeated these words, he pointed to\nthe heavenly sanctuary. The minds of all who embrace this message\nare directed to the most holy place, where Jesus stands before the\nark, making His final intercession for all those for whom mercy\nstill lingers and for those who have ignorantly broken the law of\nGod. This atonement is made for the righteous dead as well as for\nthe righteous living. It includes all who died trusting in Christ, but\nwho, not having received the light upon God\u2019s commandments, had\nsinned ignorantly in transgressing its precepts.\nAfter Jesus opened the door of the most holy, the light of the\nSabbath was seen, and the people of God were tested, as the children\nof Israel were tested anciently, to see if they would keep God\u2019s law. I\nsaw the third angel pointing upward, showing the disappointed ones [255]\nthe way to the holiest of the heavenly sanctuary. As they by faith\nenter the most holy, they find Jesus, and hope and joy spring up anew.\nI saw them looking back, reviewing the past, from the proclamation\nof the second advent of Jesus, down through their experience to\n243\n244 Early Writings\nthe passing of the time in 1844. They see their disappointment\nexplained, and joy and certainty again animate them. The third angel\nhas lighted up the past, the present, and the future, and they know\nthat God has indeed led them by His mysterious providence.\nIt was represented to me that the remnant followed Jesus into\nthe most holy place and beheld the ark and the mercy seat, and were\ncaptivated with their glory. Jesus then raised the cover of the ark,\nand lo! the tables of stone, with the ten commandments written\nupon them. They trace down the lively oracles, but start back with\ntrembling when they see the fourth commandment among the ten\nholy precepts, with a brighter light shining upon it than upon the\nother nine, and a halo of glory all around it. They find nothing there\ninforming them that the Sabbath has been abolished, or changed to\nthe first day of the week. The commandment reads as when spoken\nby the voice of God in solemn and awful grandeur upon the mount,\nwhile the lightnings flashed and the thunders rolled; it is the same\nas when written with His own finger on the tables of stone: \u201cSix\ndays shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the\nSabbath of the Lord thy God.\u201d They are amazed as they behold the\ncare taken of the ten commandments. They see them placed close\nby Jehovah, overshadowed and protected by His holiness. They see\nthat they have been trampling upon the fourth commandment of the\nDecalogue, and have observed a day handed down by the heathen[256]\nand papists, instead of the day sanctified by Jehovah. They humble\nthemselves before God and mourn over their past transgressions.\nI saw the incense in the censer smoke as Jesus offered their con-\nfessions and prayers to His Father. And as it ascended, a bright light\nrested upon Jesus and upon the mercy seat; and the earnest, praying\nones, who were troubled because they had discovered themselves to\nbe transgressors of God\u2019s law, were blessed, and their countenances\nlighted up with hope and joy. They joined in the work of the third\nangel and raised their voices to proclaim the solemn warning. But\nfew at first received it; yet the faithful continued with energy to\nproclaim the message. Then I saw many embrace the message of the\nthird angel and unite their voices with those who had first given the\nwarning, and they honored God by observing His sanctified rest day.\nMany who embraced the third message had not had an experience\nin the two former messages. Satan understood this, and his evil\nThird Angel\u2019s Message 245\neye was upon them to overthrow them; but the third angel was\npointing them to the most holy place, and those who had had an\nexperience in the past messages were pointing them the way to\nthe heavenly sanctuary. Many saw the perfect chain of truth in\nthe angels\u2019 messages, and gladly received them in their order, and\nfollowed Jesus by faith into the heavenly sanctuary. These messages\nwere represented to me as an anchor to the people of God. Those\nwho understand and receive them will be kept from being swept\naway by the many delusions of Satan.\nAfter the great disappointment in 1844, Satan and his angels\nwere busily engaged in laying snares to unsettle the faith of the body.\nHe affected the minds of persons who had had an experience in the [257]\nmessages, and who had an appearance of humility. Some pointed to\nthe future for the fulfillment of the first and second messages, while\nothers pointed far back into the past, declaring that they had been\nthere fulfilled. These were gaining an influence over the minds of the\ninexperienced and unsettling their faith. Some were searching the\nBible to build up a faith of their own, independent of the body. Satan\nexulted in all this; for he knew that those who broke loose from\nthe anchor he could affect by different errors and drive about with\ndivers winds of doctrine. Many who had led in the first and second\nmessages now denied them, and there was division and confusion\nthroughout the body.\nMy attention was then called to William Miller. He looked\nperplexed and was bowed with anxiety and distress for his people.\nThe company who had been united and loving in 1844 were losing\ntheir love, opposing one another, and falling into a cold, backslidden\nstate. As he beheld this, grief wasted his strength. I saw leading men\nwatching him, and fearing lest he should receive the third angel\u2019s\nmessage and the commandments of God. And as he would lean\ntoward the light from heaven, these men would lay some plan to\ndraw his mind away. A human influence was exerted to keep him in\ndarkness and to retain his influence among those who opposed the\ntruth. At length William Miller raised his voice against the light from\nheaven. He failed in not receiving the message which would have\nfully explained his disappointment and cast a light and glory on the\npast, which would have revived his exhausted energies, brightened\nhis hope, and led him to glorify God. He leaned to human wisdom\n246 Early Writings\ninstead of divine, but being broken with arduous labor in his Master\u2019s\ncause and by age, he was not as accountable as those who kept him[258]\nfrom the truth. They are responsible; the sin rests upon them.\nIf William Miller could have seen the light of the third message,\nmany things which looked dark and mysterious to him would have\nbeen explained. But his brethren professed so deep love and interest\nfor him, that he thought he could not tear away from them. His heart\nwould incline toward the truth, and then he looked at his brethren;\nthey opposed it. Could he tear away from those who had stood side\nby side with him in proclaiming the coming of Jesus? He thought\nthey surely would not lead him astray.\nGod suffered him to fall under the power of Satan, the dominion\nof death, and hid him in the grave from those who were constantly\ndrawing him from the truth. Moses erred as he was about to enter\nthe Promised Land. So also, I saw that William Miller erred as he\nwas soon to enter the heavenly Canaan, in suffering his influence to\ngo against the truth. Others led him to this; others must account for\nit. But angels watch the precious dust of this servant of God, and he\nwill come forth at the sound of the last trump.\nA Firm Platform\nI saw a company who stood well guarded and firm, giving no\ncountenance to those who would unsettle the established faith of\nthe body. God looked upon them with approbation. I was shown\nthree steps\u2014the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. Said my\naccompanying angel, \u201cWoe to him who shall move a block or stir a\npin of these messages. The true understanding of these messages is\nof vital importance. The destiny of souls hangs upon the manner in [259]\nwhich they are received.\u201d I was again brought down through these\nmessages, and saw how dearly the people of God had purchased\ntheir experience. It had been obtained through much suffering and\nsevere conflict. God had led them along step by step, until He had\nplaced them upon a solid, immovable platform. I saw individuals\napproach the platform and examine the foundation. Some with\nrejoicing immediately stepped upon it. Others commenced to find\nfault with the foundation. They wished improvements made, and\nthen the platform would be more perfect, and the people much\nhappier. Some stepped off the platform to examine it and declared\nit to be laid wrong. But I saw that nearly all stood firm upon the\nplatform and exhorted those who had stepped off to cease their\ncomplaints; for God was the Master Builder, and they were fighting\nagainst Him. They recounted the wonderful work of God, which\nhad led them to the firm platform, and in union raised their eyes\nto heaven and with a loud voice glorified God. This affected some\nof those who had complained and left the platform, and they with\nhumble look again stepped upon it.\nI was pointed back to the proclamation of the first advent of\nChrist. John was sent in the spirit and power of Elijah to prepare the\nway of Jesus. Those who rejected the testimony of John were not\nbenefited by the teachings of Jesus. Their opposition to the message\nthat foretold His coming placed them where they could not readily\nreceive the strongest evidence that He was the Messiah. Satan led on\nthose who rejected the message of John to go still farther, to reject\n247\n248 Early Writings\nand crucify Christ. In doing this they placed themselves where they\ncould not receive the blessing on the day of Pentecost, which would\nhave taught them the way into the heavenly sanctuary. The rending\nof the veil of the temple showed that the Jewish sacrifices and ordi-[260]\nnances would no longer be received. The great Sacrifice had been\noffered and had been accepted, and the Holy Spirit which descended\non the day of Pentecost carried the minds of the disciples from the\nearthly sanctuary to the heavenly, where Jesus had entered by His\nown blood, to shed upon His disciples the benefits of His atonement.\nBut the Jews were left in total darkness. They lost all the light which\nthey might have had upon the plan of salvation, and still trusted in\ntheir useless sacrifices and offerings. The heavenly sanctuary had\ntaken the place of the earthly, yet they had no knowledge of the\nchange. Therefore they could not be benefited by the mediation of\nChrist in the holy place.\nMany look with horror at the course of the Jews in rejecting and\ncrucifying Christ; and as they read the history of His shameful abuse,\nthey think they love Him, and would not have denied Him as did\nPeter, or crucified Him as did the Jews. But God who reads the hearts\nof all, has brought to the test that love for Jesus which they professed\nto feel. All heaven watched with the deepest interest the reception of\nthe first angel\u2019s message. But many who professed to love Jesus, and\nwho shed tears as they read the story of the cross, derided the good\nnews of His coming. Instead of receiving the message with gladness,\nthey declared it to be a delusion. They hated those who loved His\nappearing and shut them out of the churches. Those who rejected the\nfirst message could not be benefited by the second; neither were they\nbenefited by the midnight cry, which was to prepare them to enter\nwith Jesus by faith into the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary.\nAnd by rejecting the two former messages, they have so darkened\ntheir understanding that they can see no light in the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, which shows the way into the most holy place. I saw that as[261]\nthe Jews crucified Jesus, so the nominal churches had crucified these\nmessages, and therefore they have no knowledge of the way into the\nmost holy, and they cannot be benefited by the intercession of Jesus\nthere. Like the Jews, who offered their useless sacrifices, they offer\nup their useless prayers to the apartment which Jesus has left; and\nSatan, pleased with the deception, assumes a religious character, and\nFirm Platform 249\nleads the minds of these professed Christians to himself, working\nwith his power, his signs and lying wonders, to fasten them in his\nsnare. Some he deceives in one way, and some in another. He has\ndifferent delusions prepared to affect different minds. Some look\nwith horror upon one deception, while they readily receive another.\nSatan deceives some with Spiritualism. He also comes as an angel\nof light and spreads his influence over the land by means of false\nreformations. The churches are elated, and consider that God is\nworking marvelously for them, when it is the work of another spirit.\nThe excitement will die away and leave the world and the church in\na worse condition than before.\nI saw that God has honest children among the nominal Adventists\nand the fallen churches, and before the plagues shall be poured out,\nministers and people will be called out from these churches and will\ngladly receive the truth. Satan knows this; and before the loud cry\nof the third angel is given, he raises an excitement in these religious\nbodies, that those who have rejected the truth may think that God is\nwith them. He hopes to deceive the honest and lead them to think\nthat God is still working for the churches. But the light will shine,\nand all who are honest will leave the fallen churches, and take their\nstand with the remnant.\nSpiritualism[262]\nThe rapping delusion was presented before me, and I saw that\nSatan has power to bring before us the appearance of forms purport-\ning to be our relatives or friends who sleep in Jesus. It will be made\nto appear as if these friends were actually present, the words they\nuttered while here, with which we were familiar, will be spoken, and\nthe same tone of voice that they had while living will fall upon the\near. All this is to deceive the world and ensnare them into the belief\nof this delusion.\nI saw that the saints must have a thorough understanding of\npresent truth, which they will be obliged to maintain from the Scrip-\ntures. They must understand the state of the dead; for the spirits of\ndevils will yet appear to them, professing to be beloved relatives\nor friends, who will declare to them unscriptural doctrines. They\nwill do all in their power to excite sympathy and will work miracles\nbefore them to confirm what they declare. The people of God must\nbe prepared to withstand these spirits with the Bible truth that the\ndead know not anything, and that they who thus appear are the spirits\nof devils.\nWe must examine well the foundation of our hope; for we shall\nhave to give a reason for it from the Scriptures. This delusion will\nspread, and we shall have to contend with it face to face; and unless\nwe are prepared for it, we shall be ensnared and overcome. But if\nwe do what we can on our part to be ready for the conflict that is\njust before us, God will do His part, and His all-powerful arm will\nprotect us. He would sooner send every angel out of glory to make a\nhedge about faithful souls, than have them deceived and led away\nby the lying wonders of Satan.\nI saw the rapidity with which this delusion was spreading. A[263]\ntrain of cars was shown me, going with the speed of lightning. The\nangel bade me look carefully. I fixed my eyes upon the train. It\nseemed that the whole world was on board. Then he showed me the\nconductor, a fair, stately person, whom all the passengers looked up\n250\nSpiritualism 251\nto and reverenced. I was perplexed and asked my attending angel\nwho it was. He said, \u201cIt is Satan. He is the conductor, in the form of\nan angel of light. He has taken the world captive. They are given\nover to strong delusions, to believe a lie that they may be damned.\nHis agent, the highest in order next to him, is the engineer, and\nothers of his agents are employed in different offices as he may need\nthem, and they are all going with lightning speed to perdition.\u201d\nI asked the angel if there were none left. He bade me look in\nthe opposite direction, and I saw a little company traveling a narrow\npathway. All seemed to be firmly united by the truth. This little\ncompany looked careworn, as if they had passed through severe\ntrials and conflicts. And it appeared as if the sun had just arisen from\nbehind a cloud and shone upon their countenances, causing them to\nlook triumphant as if their victories were nearly won.\nI saw that the Lord has given the world opportunity to discover\nthe snare. This one thing is evidence enough for the Christian if there\nwere no other; there is no difference made between the precious and\nthe vile. Thomas Paine, whose body has now moldered to dust and\nwho is to be called forth at the end of the one thousand years, at\nthe second resurrection, to receive his reward, and suffer the second\ndeath, is represented by Satan as being in heaven, and highly exalted\nthere. Satan used him on earth as long as he could, and now he is\ncarrying on the same work through pretensions of having Thomas [264]\nPaine so much exalted and honored in heaven; and as he taught here,\nSatan would make it appear that he is teaching there. And some\nwho have looked with horror at his life and death, and his corrupt\nteachings while living, now submit to be taught by him\u2014one of the\nvilest and most corrupt of men, one who despised God and His law.\nHe who is the father of lies, blinds and deceives the world by\nsending forth his angels to speak for the apostles, and to make it\nappear that they contradict what they wrote by the dictation of the\nHoly Ghost when on earth. These lying angels make the apostles to\ncorrupt their own teachings and to declare them to be adulterated.\nBy so doing, Satan delights to throw professed Christians and all\nthe world into uncertainty about the Word of God. That holy Book\ncuts directly across his track and thwarts his plans; therefore he\nleads men to doubt the divine origin of the Bible. Then he sets up\nthe infidel Thomas Paine, as if when he died he were ushered into\n252 Early Writings\nheaven, and now, united with the holy apostles whom he hated on\nearth, were engaged in teaching the world.\nSatan assigns to each of his angels a part to act. He enjoins upon\nthem all to be sly, artful, cunning. He instructs some of them to act\nthe part of the apostles and to speak for them, while others are to act\nthe part of infidels and wicked men who died cursing God, but now\nappear to be very religious. There is no difference made between\nthe most holy apostles and the vilest infidels. They are both made\nto teach the same thing. It matters not whom Satan makes to speak,\nif his object is only accomplished. He was intimately connected\nwith Paine upon earth, aiding him in his work, and it is an easy\nthing for him to know the very words and the handwriting of one\nwho served him so faithfully and accomplished his purposes so well.[265]\nSatan dictated much of Paine\u2019s writings, and it is an easy thing for\nhim to dictate sentiments through his angels now, and make it appear\nthat they come through Thomas Paine. This is the masterpiece of\nSatan. All this teaching, purporting to be from apostles and saints\nand wicked men who have died, comes directly from his satanic\nmajesty.\nThe fact that Satan claims that one whom he loved so well, and\nwho hated God so perfectly, is now with the holy apostles and angels\nin glory, should be enough to remove the veil from all minds and\ndiscover to them the dark, mysterious works of Satan. He virtually\nsays to the world and to infidels, \u201cNo matter how wicked you are, no\nmatter whether you believe or disbelieve in God or the Bible, live as\nyou please, heaven is your home; for all know that if Thomas Paine\nis in heaven, and so exalted, they will surely get there.\u201d This is so\nglaring that all may see if they will. Satan is now doing, through\nindividuals like Thomas Paine, what he has been trying to do since\nhis fall. He is, through his power and lying wonders, tearing away the\nfoundation of the Christian\u2019s hope and putting out the sun that is to\nlight the narrow way to heaven. He is making the world believe that\nthe Bible is uninspired, no better than a storybook, while he holds\nout something to take its place; namely, spiritual manifestations.\nHere is a channel wholly devoted to himself, under his control,\nand he can make the world believe what he will. The book that is\nto judge him and his followers, he puts back into the shade, just\nwhere he wants it. The Saviour of the world he makes to be no\nSpiritualism 253\nmore than a common man; and as the Roman guard that watched the\ntomb of Jesus spread the lying report that the chief priests and elders\nput into their mouths, so will the poor, deluded followers of these [266]\npretended spiritual manifestations repeat and try to make it appear\nthat there is nothing miraculous about our Saviour\u2019s birth, death, and\nresurrection. After putting Jesus in the background, they attract the\nattention of the world to themselves and to their miracles and lying\nwonders, which, they declare, far exceed the works of Christ. Thus\nthe world is taken in the snare and lulled to a feeling of security, not\nto find out their awful deception until the seven last plagues shall be\npoured out. Satan laughs as he sees his plan succeed so well and the\nwhole world taken in the snare.\nCovetousness\nI saw that Satan bade his angels lay their snares especially for\nthose who were looking for Christ\u2019s second appearing and keep-\ning all the commandments of God. Satan told his angels that the\nchurches were asleep. He would increase his power and lying won-\nders, and he could hold them. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, \u201cthe sect of Sabbath-\nkeepers we hate; they are continually working against us, and taking\nfrom us our subjects, to keep the hated law of God. Go, make the\npossessors of lands and money drunk with cares. If you can make\nthem place their affections upon these things, we shall have them\nyet. They may profess what they please, only make them care more\nfor money than for the success of Christ\u2019s kingdom or the spread\nof the truths we hate. Present the world before them in the most\nattractive light, that they may love and idolize it. We must keep in\nour ranks all the means of which we can gain control. The more\nmeans the followers of Christ devote to His service, the more will[267]\nthey injure our kingdom by getting our subjects. As they appoint\nmeetings in different places, we are in danger. Be very vigilant then.\nCause disturbance and confusion if possible. Destroy love for one\nanother. Discourage and dishearten their ministers; for we hate them.\nPresent every plausible excuse to those who have means, lest they\nhand it out. Control the money matters if you can, and drive their\nministers to want and distress. This will weaken their courage and\nzeal. Battle every inch of ground. Make covetousness and love of\nearthly treasures the ruling traits of their character. As long as these\ntraits rule, salvation and grace stand back. Crowd every attraction\naround them, and they will be surely ours. And not only are we\nsure of them, but their hateful influence will not be exercised to lead\nothers to heaven. When any shall attempt to give, put within them a\ngrudging disposition, that it may be sparingly.\u201d\nI saw that Satan carries out his plans well. As the servants of\nGod appoint meetings, Satan with his angels is on the ground to\nhinder the work. He is constantly putting suggestions into the minds\n254\nCovetousness 255\nof God\u2019s people. He leads some in one way and some in another,\nalways taking advantage of evil traits in the brethren and sisters,\nexciting and stirring up their natural besetments. If they are disposed\nto be selfish and covetous, Satan takes his stand by their side, and\nwith all his power seeks to lead them to indulge their besetting\nsins. The grace of God and the light of truth may melt away their\ncovetous, selfish feelings for a little, but if they do not obtain entire\nvictory, Satan comes in when they are not under a saving influence\nand withers every noble, generous principle, and they think that too\nmuch is required of them. They become weary of well-doing and\nforget the great sacrifice which Jesus made to redeem them from the [268]\npower of Satan and from hopeless misery.\nSatan took advantage of the covetous, selfish disposition of Judas\nand led him to murmur when Mary poured the costly ointment upon\nJesus. Judas looked upon this as a great waste, and declared that the\nointment might have been sold and given to the poor. He cared not\nfor the poor, but considered the liberal offering to Jesus extravagant.\nJudas prized his Lord just enough to sell Him for a few pieces of\nsilver. And I saw that there were some like Judas among those who\nprofess to be waiting for their Lord. Satan controls them, but they\nknow it not. God cannot approve of the least degree of covetousness\nor selfishness, and He abhors the prayers and exhortations of those\nwho indulge these evil traits. As Satan sees that his time is short, he\nleads men on to be more and more selfish and covetous, and then\nexults as he sees them wrapped up in themselves, close, penurious,\nand selfish. If the eyes of such could be opened, they would see\nSatan in hellish triumph, exulting over them and laughing at the folly\nof those who accept his suggestions and enter his snares.\nSatan and his angels mark all the mean and covetous acts of\nthese persons and present them to Jesus and His holy angels, saying\nreproachfully, \u201cThese are Christ\u2019s followers! They are preparing\nto be translated!\u201d Satan compares their course with passages of\nScripture in which it is plainly rebuked and then taunts the heavenly\nangels, saying, \u201cThese are following Christ and His Word! These are\nthe fruit of Christ\u2019s sacrifice and redemption!\u201d Angels turn in disgust\nfrom the scene. God requires a constant doing on the part of His\npeople; and when they become weary of well-doing, He becomes\nweary of them. I saw that He is greatly displeased with the least\n256 Early Writings\nmanifestation of selfishness on the part of His professed people,[269]\nfor whom Jesus spared not His own precious life. Every selfish,\ncovetous person will fall out by the way. Like Judas, who sold his\nLord, they will sell good principles and a noble, generous disposition\nfor a little of earth\u2019s gain. All such will be sifted out from God\u2019s\npeople. Those who want heaven must, with all the energy which\nthey possess, be encouraging the principles of heaven. Instead of\nwithering up with selfishness, their souls should be expanding with\nbenevolence. Every opportunity should be improved in doing good\nto one another and thus cherishing the principles of heaven. Jesus\nwas presented to me as the perfect pattern. His life was without\nselfish interest, but ever marked with disinterested benevolence.\nThe Shaking\nI saw some, with strong faith and agonizing cries, pleading with\nGod. Their countenances were pale and marked with deep anxiety,\nexpressive of their internal struggle. Firmness and great earnestness\nwas expressed in their countenances; large drops of perspiration fell\nfrom their foreheads. Now and then their faces would light up with\nthe marks of God\u2019s approbation, and again the same solemn, earnest,\nanxious look would settle upon them.\nEvil angels crowded around, pressing darkness upon them to\nshut out Jesus from their view, that their eyes might be drawn to the\ndarkness that surrounded them, and thus they be led to distrust God\nand murmur against Him. Their only safety was in keeping their\neyes directed upward. Angels of God had charge over His people,\nand as the poisonous atmosphere of evil angels was pressed around\nthese anxious ones, the heavenly angels were continually wafting [270]\ntheir wings over them to scatter the thick darkness.\nAs the praying ones continued their earnest cries, at times a ray\nof light from Jesus came to them, to encourage their hearts and light\nup their countenances. Some, I saw, did not participate in this work\nof agonizing and pleading. They seemed indifferent and careless.\nThey were not resisting the darkness around them, and it shut them\nin like a thick cloud. The angels of God left these and went to the\naid of the earnest, praying ones. I saw angels of God hasten to the\nassistance of all who were struggling with all their power to resist\nthe evil angels and trying to help themselves by calling upon God\nwith perseverance. But His angels left those who made no effort to\nhelp themselves, and I lost sight of them.\nI asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen and was shown\nthat it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the\ncounsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its\neffect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the\nstandard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this\n257\n258 Early Writings\nstraight testimony. They will rise up against it, and this is what will\ncause a shaking among God\u2019s people.\nI saw that the testimony of the True Witness has not been half\nheeded. The solemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church\nhangs has been lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded. This\ntestimony must work deep repentance; all who truly receive it will\nobey it and be purified.\nSaid the angel, \u201cList ye!\u201d Soon I heard a voice like many musical\ninstruments all sounding in perfect strains, sweet and harmonious. It\nsurpassed any music I had ever heard, seeming to be full of mercy,\ncompassion, and elevating, holy joy. It thrilled through my whole[271]\nbeing. Said the angel, \u201cLook ye!\u201d My attention was then turned to\nthe company I had seen, who were mightily shaken. I was shown\nthose whom I had before seen weeping and praying in agony of\nspirit. The company of guardian angels around them had been\ndoubled, and they were clothed with an armor from their head to\ntheir feet. They moved in exact order, like a company of soldiers.\nTheir countenances expressed the severe conflict which they had\nendured, the agonizing struggle they had passed through. Yet their\nfeatures, marked with severe internal anguish, now shone with the\nlight and glory of heaven. They had obtained the victory, and it\ncalled forth from them the deepest gratitude and holy, sacred joy.\nThe numbers of this company had lessened. Some had been\nshaken out and left by the way. The careless and indifferent, who\ndid not join with those who prized victory and salvation enough to\nperseveringly plead and agonize for it, did not obtain it, and they\nwere left behind in darkness, and their places were immediately\nfilled by others taking hold of the truth and coming into the ranks.\nEvil angels still pressed around them, but could have no power over\nthem.\nI heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth with\ngreat power. It had effect. Many had been bound; some wives by\ntheir husbands, and some children by their parents. The honest who\nhad been prevented from hearing the truth now eagerly laid hold\nupon it. All fear of their relatives was gone, and the truth alone was\nexalted to them. They had been hungering and thirsting for truth; it\nwas dearer and more precious than life. I asked what had made this\nShaking 259\ngreat change. An angel answered, \u201cIt is the latter rain, the refreshing\nfrom the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third angel.\u201d\nGreat power was with these chosen ones. Said the angel, \u201cLook [272]\nye!\u201d My attention was turned to the wicked, or unbelievers. They\nwere all astir. The zeal and power with the people of God had\naroused and enraged them. Confusion, confusion, was on every\nside. I saw measures taken against the company who had the light\nand power of God. Darkness thickened around them; yet they stood\nfirm, approved of God, and trusting in Him. I saw them perplexed;\nnext I heard them crying unto God earnestly. Day and night their\ncry ceased not: \u201cThy will, O God, be done! If it can glorify Thy\nname, make a way of escape for Thy people! Deliver us from\nthe heathen around about us. They have appointed us unto death;\nbut Thine arm can bring salvation.\u201d These are all the words which\nI can bring to mind. All seemed to have a deep sense of their\nunworthiness and manifested entire submission to the will of God;\nyet, like Jacob, every one, without an exception, was earnestly\npleading and wrestling for deliverance.\nSoon after they had commenced their earnest cry, the angels, in\nsympathy, desired to go to their deliverance. But a tall, commanding\nangel suffered them not. He said, \u201cThe will of God is not yet fulfilled.\nThey must drink of the cup. They must be baptized with the baptism.\u201d\nSoon I heard the voice of God, which shook the heavens and\nthe earth. There was a mighty earthquake. Buildings were shaken\ndown on every side. I then heard a triumphant shout of victory,\nloud, musical, and clear. I looked upon the company, who, a short\ntime before, were in such distress and bondage. Their captivity was\nturned. A glorious light shone upon them. How beautiful they then\nlooked! All marks of care and weariness were gone, and health and\nbeauty were seen in every countenance. Their enemies, the heathen [273]\naround them, fell like dead men; they could not endure the light that\nshone upon the delivered, holy ones. This light and glory remained\nupon them, until Jesus was seen in the clouds of heaven, and the\nfaithful, tried company were changed in a moment, in the twinkling\nof an eye, from glory to glory. And the graves were opened, and the\nsaints came forth, clothed with immortality, crying, \u201cVictory over\ndeath and the grave\u201d; and together with the living saints they were\n260 Early Writings\ncaught up to meet their Lord in the air, while rich, musical shouts of\nglory and victory were upon every immortal tongue.\nThe Sins of Babylon\nI saw that since the second angel proclaimed the fall of the\nchurches, they have been growing more and more corrupt. They\nbear the name of being Christ\u2019s followers; yet it is impossible to\ndistinguish them from the world. Ministers take their texts from the\nWord of God, but preach smooth things. To this the natural heart\nfeels no objection. It is only the spirit and power of the truth and\nthe salvation of Christ that are hateful to the carnal heart. There is\nnothing in the popular ministry that stirs the wrath of Satan, makes\nthe sinner tremble, or applies to the heart and conscience the fearful\nrealities of a judgment soon to come. Wicked men are generally\npleased with a form of piety without true godliness, and they will\naid and support such a religion.\nSaid the angel, \u201cNothing less than the whole armor of righ-\nteousness can enable man to overcome the powers of darkness and\nretain the victory over them. Satan has taken full possession of the\nchurches as a body. The sayings and doings of men are dwelt upon [274]\ninstead of the plain, cutting truths of the Word of God. The spirit and\nfriendship of the world are at enmity with God. When the truth in its\nsimplicity and strength, as it is in Jesus, is brought to bear against the\nspirit of the world, it at once awakens the spirit of persecution. Very\nmany who profess to be Christians have not known God. The natural\nheart has not been changed, and the carnal mind remains at enmity\nwith God. They are Satan\u2019s faithful servants, notwithstanding they\nhave assumed another name.\u201d\nI saw that since Jesus left the holy place of the heavenly sanctuary\nand entered within the second veil, the churches have been filling up\nwith every unclean and hateful bird. I saw great iniquity and vileness\nin the churches; yet their members profess to be Christians. Their\nprofession, their prayers, and their exhortations are an abomination\nin the sight of God. Said the angel, \u201cGod will not smell in their\nassemblies. Selfishness, fraud, and deceit are practiced by them\nwithout the reprovings of conscience. And over all these evil traits\n261\n262 Early Writings\nthey throw the cloak of religion.\u201d I was shown the pride of the\nnominal churches. God is not in their thoughts; their carnal minds\ndwell upon themselves; they decorate their poor mortal bodies, and\nthen look upon themselves with satisfaction and pleasure. Jesus and\nthe angels look upon them in anger. Said the angel, \u201cTheir sins and\npride have reached unto heaven. Their portion is prepared. Justice\nand judgment have slumbered long, but will soon awake. Vengeance\nis Mine, I will repay, saith the Lord.\u201d The fearful threatenings of\nthe third angel are to be realized, and all the wicked are to drink of\nthe wrath of God. An innumerable host of evil angels are spreading\nover the whole land and crowding the churches. These agents of\nSatan look upon the religious bodies with exultation, for the cloak[275]\nof religion covers the greatest crime and iniquity.\nAll heaven beholds with indignation human beings, the work-\nmanship of God, reduced by their fellow men to the lowest depths of\ndegradation and placed on a level with the brute creation. Professed\nfollowers of that dear Saviour whose compassion was ever moved\nat the sight of human woe, heartily engage in this enormous and\ngrievous sin, and deal in slaves and souls of men. Human agony\nis carried from place to place and bought and sold. Angels have\nrecorded it all; it is written in the book. The tears of the pious bond-\nmen and bondwomen, of fathers, mothers, and children, brothers\nand sisters, are all bottled up in heaven. God will restrain His anger\nbut little longer. His wrath burns against this nation and especially\nagainst the religious bodies that have sanctioned this terrible traffic\nand have themselves engaged in it. Such injustice, such oppres-\nsion, such sufferings, are looked upon with heartless indifference\nby many professed followers of the meek and lowly Jesus. And\nmany of them can themselves inflict, with hateful satisfaction, all\nthis indescribable agony; and yet they dare to worship God. It is\nsolemn mockery; Satan exults over it and reproaches Jesus and His\nangels with such inconsistency, saying, with hellish triumph, \u201cSuch\nare Christ\u2019s followers!\u201d\nThese professed Christians read of the sufferings of the martyrs,\nand tears course down their cheeks. They wonder that men could\never become so hardened as to practice such cruelty toward their\nfellow men. Yet those who think and speak thus are at the same time\nholding human beings in slavery. And this is not all; they sever the\nSins of Babylon 263\nties of nature and cruelly oppress their fellow men. They can inflict\nmost inhuman torture with the same relentless cruelty manifested\nby papists and heathen toward Christ\u2019s followers. Said the angel, \u201cIt [276]\nwill be more tolerable for the heathen and for papists in the day of\nthe execution of God\u2019s judgment than for such men.\u201d The cries of\nthe oppressed have reached unto heaven, and angels stand amazed at\nthe untold, agonizing sufferings which man, formed in the image of\nhis Maker, causes his fellow man. Said the angel, \u201cThe names of the\noppressors are written in blood, crossed with stripes, and flooded\nwith agonizing, burning tears of suffering. God\u2019s anger will not\ncease until He has caused this land of light to drink the dregs of the\ncup of His fury, until He has rewarded unto Babylon double. Reward\nher even as she rewarded you, double unto her double according to\nher works; in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double.\u201d\nI saw that the slave master [see Appendix.] will have to answer\nfor the soul of his slave whom he has kept in ignorance; and the\nsins of the slave will be visited upon the master. God cannot take to\nheaven the slave who has been kept in ignorance and degradation,\nknowing nothing of God or the Bible, fearing nothing but his mas-\nter\u2019s lash, and holding a lower position than the brutes. But He does\nthe best thing for him that a compassionate God can do. He permits\nhim to be as if he had not been, while the master must endure the\nseven last plagues and then come up in the second resurrection and\nsuffer the second, most awful death. Then the justice of God will be\nsatisfied.\nThe Loud Cry[277]\nI saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending to the\nearth, and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfillment\nof some important event. Then I saw another mighty angel com-\nmissioned to descend to the earth, to unite his voice with the third\nangel, and give power and force to his message. Great power and\nglory were imparted to the angel, and as he descended, the earth\nwas lightened with his glory. The light which attended this angel\npenetrated everywhere, as he cried mightily, with a strong voice,\n\u201cBabylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of\ndevils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean\nand hateful bird.\u201d The message of the fall of Babylon, as given by\nthe second angel, is repeated, with the additional mention of the\ncorruptions which have been entering the churches since 1844. The\nwork of this angel comes in at the right time to join in the last great\nwork of the third angel\u2019s message as it swells to a loud cry. And the\npeople of God are thus prepared to stand in the hour of temptation,\nwhich they are soon to meet. I saw a great light resting upon them,\nand they united to fearlessly proclaim the third angel\u2019s message.\nAngels were sent to aid the mighty angel from heaven, and I\nheard voices which seemed to sound everywhere, \u201cCome out of her,\nMy people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive\nnot of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God\nhath remembered her iniquities.\u201d This message seemed to be an\naddition to the third message, joining it as the midnight cry joined\nthe second angel\u2019s message in 1844. The glory of God rested upon\nthe patient, waiting saints, and they fearlessly gave the last solemn[278]\nwarning, proclaiming the fall of Babylon and calling upon God\u2019s\npeople to come out of her that they might escape her fearful doom.\nThe light that was shed upon the waiting ones penetrated every-\nwhere, and those in the churches who had any light, who had not\nheard and rejected the three messages, obeyed the call and left the\nfallen churches. Many had come to years of accountability since\n264\nLoud Cry 265\nthese messages had been given, and the light shone upon them, and\nthey were privileged to choose life or death. Some chose life and\ntook their stand with those who were looking for their Lord and\nkeeping all His commandments. The third message was to do its\nwork; all were to be tested upon it, and the precious ones were to\nbe called out from the religious bodies. A compelling power moved\nthe honest, while the manifestation of the power of God brought a\nfear and restraint upon their unbelieving relatives and friends so that\nthey dared not, neither had they the power to, hinder those who felt\nthe work of the Spirit of God upon them. The last call was carried\neven to the poor slaves, and the pious among them poured forth their\nsongs of rapturous joy at the prospect of their happy deliverance.\nTheir masters could not check them; fear and astonishment kept\nthem silent. Mighty miracles were wrought, the sick were healed,\nand signs and wonders followed the believers. God was in the work,\nand every saint, fearless of consequences, followed the convictions\nof his own conscience and united with those who were keeping all\nthe commandments of God; and with power they sounded abroad\nthe third message. I saw that this message will close with power and\nstrength far exceeding the midnight cry.\nServants of God, endowed with power from on high with their [279]\nfaces lighted up, and shining with holy consecration, went forth to\nproclaim the message from heaven. Souls that were scattered all\nthrough the religious bodies answered to the call, and the precious\nwere hurried out of the doomed churches, as Lot was hurried out of\nSodom before her destruction. God\u2019s people were strengthened by\nthe excellent glory which rested upon them in rich abundance and\nprepared them to endure the hour of temptation. I heard everywhere\na multitude of voices saying, \u201cHere is the patience of the saints:\nhere are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of\nJesus.\u201d\nThe Third Message Closed\nI was pointed down to the time when the third angel\u2019s message\nwas closing. The power of God had rested upon His people; they\nhad accomplished their work and were prepared for the trying hour\nbefore them. They had received the latter rain, or refreshing from\nthe presence of the Lord, and the living testimony had been revived.\nThe last great warning had sounded everywhere, and it had stirred\nup and enraged the inhabitants of the earth who would not receive\nthe message.\nI saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel with a\nwriter\u2019s inkhorn by his side returned from the earth and reported\nto Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered\nand sealed. Then I saw Jesus, who had been ministering before\nthe ark containing the ten commandments, throw down the censer.\nHe raised His hands, and with a loud voice said, \u201cIt is done. \u201dAnd\nall the angelic host laid off their crowns as Jesus made the solemn\ndeclaration, \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which[280]\nis filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be\nrighteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.\u201d\nEvery case had been decided for life or death. While Jesus had\nbeen ministering in the sanctuary, the judgment had been going on\nfor the righteous dead, and then for the righteous living. Christ had\nreceived His kingdom, having made the atonement for His people\nand blotted out their sins. The subjects of the kingdom were made\nup. The marriage of the Lamb was consummated. And the kingdom,\nand the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, was given\nto Jesus and the heirs of salvation, and Jesus was to reign as King of\nkings and Lord of lords.\nAs Jesus moved out of the most holy place, I heard the tinkling\nof the bells upon His garment; and as He left, a cloud of darkness\ncovered the inhabitants of the earth. There was then no mediator\nbetween guilty man and an offended God. While Jesus had been\nstanding between God and guilty man, a restraint was upon the\n266\nThird Message Closed 267\npeople; but when He stepped out from between man and the Father,\nthe restraint was removed and Satan had entire control of the finally\nimpenitent. It was impossible for the plagues to be poured out while\nJesus officiated in the sanctuary; but as His work there is finished,\nand His intercession closes, there is nothing to stay the wrath of\nGod, and it breaks with fury upon the shelterless head of the guilty\nsinner, who has slighted salvation and hated reproof. In that fearful\ntime, after the close of Jesus\u2019 mediation, the saints were living in the\nsight of a holy God without an intercessor. Every case was decided,\nevery jewel numbered. Jesus tarried a moment in the outer apartment\nof the heavenly sanctuary, and the sins which had been confessed\nwhile He was in the most holy place were placed upon Satan, the [281]\noriginator of sin, who must suffer their punishment.\nThen I saw Jesus lay off His priestly attire and clothe Himself\nwith His most kingly robes. Upon His head were many crowns,\na crown within a crown. Surrounded by the angelic host, He left\nheaven. The plagues were falling upon the inhabitants of the earth.\nSome were denouncing God and cursing Him. Others rushed to the\npeople of God and begged to be taught how they might escape His\njudgments. But the saints had nothing for them. The last tear for\nsinners had been shed, the last agonizing prayer offered, the last\nburden borne, the last warning given. The sweet voice of mercy\nwas no more to invite them. When the saints, and all heaven, were\ninterested for their salvation, they had no interest for themselves.\nLife and death had been set before them. Many desired life, but made\nno effort to obtain it. They did not choose life, and now there was\nno atoning blood to cleanse the guilty, no compassionate Saviour to\nplead for them, and cry, \u201cSpare, spare the sinner a little longer.\u201d All\nheaven had united with Jesus, as they heard the fearful words, \u201cIt is\ndone. It is finished.\u201d The plan of salvation had been accomplished,\nbut few had chosen to accept it. And as mercy\u2019s sweet voice died\naway, fear and horror seized the wicked. With terrible distinctness\nthey heard the words, \u201cToo late! too late!\u201d\nThose who had not prized God\u2019s Word were hurrying to and fro,\nwandering from sea to sea, and from the north to the east, to seek the\nWord of the Lord. Said the angel, \u201cThey shall not find it. There is a\nfamine in the land; not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but\nfor hearing the words of the Lord. What would they not give for one\n268 Early Writings\nword of approval from God! but no, they must hunger and thirst on.\nDay after day have they slighted salvation, prizing earthly riches and[282]\nearthly pleasure higher than any heavenly treasure or inducement.\nThey have rejected Jesus and despised His saints. The filthy must\nremain filthy forever.\u201d\nMany of the wicked were greatly enraged as they suffered the\neffects of the plagues. It was a scene of fearful agony. Parents were\nbitterly reproaching their children, and children their parents, broth-\ners their sisters, and sisters their brothers. Loud, wailing cries were\nheard in every direction, \u201cIt was you who kept me from receiving the\ntruth which would have saved me from this awful hour.\u201d The people\nturned upon their ministers with bitter hate and reproached them,\nsaying, \u201cYou have not warned us. You told us that all the world was\nto be converted, and cried, Peace, peace, to quiet every fear that was\naroused. You have not told us of this hour; and those who warned us\nof it you declared to be fanatics and evil men, who would ruin us.\u201d\nBut I saw that the ministers did not escape the wrath of God. Their\nsuffering was tenfold greater than that of their people.\nThe Time of Trouble\nI saw the saints leaving the cities and villages, and associating\ntogether in companies, and living in the most solitary places. Angels\nprovided them food and water, while the wicked were suffering from\nhunger and thirst. Then I saw the leading men of the earth consulting\ntogether, and Satan and his angels busy around them. I saw a writing,\ncopies of which were scattered in different parts of the land, giving\norders that unless the saints should yield their peculiar faith, give up\nthe Sabbath, and observe the first day of the week, the people were [283]\nat liberty after a certain time to put them to death. But in this hour of\ntrial the saints were calm and composed, trusting in God and leaning\nupon His promise that a way of escape would be made for them.\nIn some places, before the time for the decree to be executed, the\nwicked rushed upon the saints to slay them; but angels in the form\nof men of war fought for them. Satan wished to have the privilege\nof destroying the saints of the Most High; but Jesus bade His angels\nwatch over them. God would be honored by making a covenant\nwith those who had kept His law, in the sight of the heathen round\nabout them; and Jesus would be honored by translating, without their\nseeing death, the faithful, waiting ones who had so long expected\nHim.\nSoon I saw the saints suffering great mental anguish. They\nseemed to be surrounded by the wicked inhabitants of the earth.\nEvery appearance was against them. Some began to fear that God\nhad at last left them to perish by the hand of the wicked. But if\ntheir eyes could have been opened, they would have seen themselves\nsurrounded by angels of God. Next came the multitude of the angry\nwicked, and next a mass of evil angels, hurrying on the wicked to\nslay the saints. But before they could approach God\u2019s people, the\nwicked must first pass this company of mighty, holy angels. This\nwas impossible. The angels of God were causing them to recede and\nalso causing the evil angels who were pressing around them to fall\nback.\n269\n270 Early Writings\nIt was an hour of fearful, terrible agony to the saints. Day and\nnight they cried unto God for deliverance. To outward appearance,\nthere was no possibility of their escape. The wicked had already\nbegun to triumph, crying out, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your God deliver you\nout of our hands? Why don\u2019t you go up and save your lives?\u201d But\nthe saints heeded them not. Like Jacob, they were wrestling with[284]\nGod. The angels longed to deliver them, but they must wait a little\nlonger; the people of God must drink of the cup and be baptized\nwith the baptism. The angels, faithful to their trust, continued their\nwatch. God would not suffer His name to be reproached among\nthe heathen. The time had nearly come when He was to manifest\nHis mighty power and gloriously deliver His saints. For His name\u2019s\nglory He would deliver every one of those who had patiently waited\nfor Him and whose names were written in the book.\nI was pointed back to faithful Noah. When the rain descended\nand the flood came, Noah and his family had entered the ark, and\nGod had shut them in. Noah had faithfully warned the inhabitants\nof the antediluvian world, while they had mocked and derided him.\nAnd as the waters descended upon the earth, and one after another\nwas drowning, they beheld that ark, of which they had made so much\nsport, riding safely upon the waters, preserving the faithful Noah\nand His family. So I saw that the people of God, who had faithfully\nwarned the world of His coming wrath, would be delivered. God\nwould not suffer the wicked to destroy those who were expecting\ntranslation and who would not bow to the decree of the beast or\nreceive his mark. I saw that if the wicked were permitted to slay\nthe saints, Satan and all his evil host, and all who hate God, would\nbe gratified. And oh, what a triumph it would be for his satanic\nmajesty to have power, in the last closing struggle, over those who\nhad so long waited to behold Him whom they loved! Those who\nhave mocked at the idea of the saints\u2019 going up will witness the care\nof God for His people and behold their glorious deliverance.\nAs the saints left the cities and villages, they were pursued by the\nwicked, who sought to slay them. But the swords that were raised to[285]\nkill God\u2019s people broke and fell as powerless as a straw. Angels of\nGod shielded the saints. As they cried day and night for deliverance,\ntheir cry came up before the Lord.\nDeliverance of the Saints\nIt was at midnight that God chose to deliver His people. As\nthe wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared,\nshining in his strength, and the moon stood still. The wicked looked\nupon the scene with amazement, while the saints beheld with solemn\njoy the tokens of their deliverance. Signs and wonders followed\nin quick succession. Everything seemed turned out of its natural\ncourse. The streams ceased to flow. Dark, heavy clouds came up and\nclashed against each other. But there was one clear place of settled\nglory, whence came the voice of God like many waters, shaking the\nheavens and the earth. There was a mighty earthquake. The graves\nwere opened, and those who had died in faith under the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, keeping the Sabbath, came forth from their dusty beds,\nglorified, to hear the covenant of peace that God was to make with\nthose who had kept His law.\nThe sky opened and shut and was in commotion. The mountains\nshook like a reed in the wind and cast out ragged rocks all around.\nThe sea boiled like a pot and cast out stones upon the land. And\nas God spoke the day and the hour of Jesus\u2019 coming and delivered\nthe everlasting covenant to His people, He spoke one sentence, and\nthen paused, while the words were rolling through the earth. The\nIsrael of God stood with their eyes fixed upward, listening to the [286]\nwords as they came from the mouth of Jehovah and rolled through\nthe earth like peals of loudest thunder. It was awfully solemn. At\nthe end of every sentence the saints shouted, \u201cGlory! Hallelujah!\u201d\nTheir countenances were lighted up with the glory of God, and they\nshone with glory as did the face of Moses when he came down from\nSinai. The wicked could not look upon them for the glory. And\nwhen the never-ending blessing was pronounced on those who had\nhonored God in keeping His Sabbath holy, there was a mighty shout\nof victory over the beast and over his image.\nThen commenced the jubilee, when the land should rest. I saw\nthe pious slave rise in victory and triumph, and shake off the chains\n271\n272 Early Writings\nthat bound him, while his wicked master was in confusion and knew\nnot what to do; for the wicked could not understand the words of the\nvoice of God.\nSoon appeared the great white cloud, upon which sat the Son\nof man. When it first appeared in the distance, this cloud looked\nvery small. The angel said that it was the sign of the Son of man.\nAs it drew nearer the earth, we could behold the excellent glory and\nmajesty of Jesus as He rode forth to conquer. A retinue of holy\nangels, with bright, glittering crowns upon their heads, escorted Him\non His way. No language can describe the glory of the scene. The\nliving cloud of majesty and unsurpassed glory came still nearer, and\nwe could clearly behold the lovely person of Jesus. He did not wear\na crown of thorns, but a crown of glory rested upon His holy brow.\nUpon His vesture and thigh was a name written, King of kings, and\nLord of lords. His countenance was as bright as the noonday sun,\nHis eyes were as a flame of fire, and His feet had the appearance of\nfine brass. His voice sounded like many musical instruments. The\nearth trembled before Him, the heavens departed as a scroll when it[287]\nis rolled together, and every mountain and island were moved out\nof their places. \u201cAnd the kings of the earth, and the great men, and\nthe rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every\nbondman, and every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the\nrocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall\non us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne,\nand from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is\ncome; and who shall be able to stand?\u201d Those who a short time\nbefore would have destroyed God\u2019s faithful children from the earth,\nnow witnessed the glory of God which rested upon them. And amid\nall their terror they heard the voices of the saints in joyful strains,\nsaying, \u201cLo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will\nsave us.\u201d\nThe earth mightily shook as the voice of the Son of God called\nforth the sleeping saints. They responded to the call and came forth\nclothed with glorious immortality, crying, \u201cVictory, victory, over\ndeath and the grave! O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is\nthy victory?\u201d Then the living saints and the risen ones raised their\nvoices in a long, transporting shout of victory. Those bodies that had\ngone down into the grave bearing the marks of disease and death\nDeliverance of the Saints 273\ncame up in immortal health and vigor. The living saints are changed\nin a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, and caught up with the\nrisen ones, and together they meet their Lord in the air. Oh, what a\nglorious meeting! Friends whom death had separated were united,\nnever more to part.\nOn each side of the cloudy chariot were wings, and beneath it\nwere living wheels; and as the chariot rolled upward, the wheels\ncried, \u201cHoly,\u201d and the wings, as they moved, cried, \u201cHoly,\u201d and the\nretinue of holy angels around the cloud cried, \u201cHoly, holy, holy, [288]\nLord God Almighty!\u201d And the saints in the cloud cried, \u201cGlory!\nAlleluia!\u201d And the chariot rolled upward to the Holy City. Before\nentering the city, the saints were arranged in a perfect square, with\nJesus in the midst. He stood head and shoulders above the saints and\nabove the angels. His majestic form and lovely countenance could\nbe seen by all in the square.\nThe Saints\u2019 Reward\nThen I saw a very great number of angels bring from the city\nglorious crowns\u2014a crown for every saint, with his name written\nthereon. As Jesus called for the crowns, angels presented them\nto Him, and with His own right hand, the lovely Jesus placed the\ncrowns on the heads of the saints. In the same manner the angels\nbrought the harps, and Jesus presented them also to the saints. The\ncommanding angels first struck the note, and then every voice was\nraised in grateful, happy praise, and every hand skillfully swept over\nthe strings of the harp, sending forth melodious music in rich and\nperfect strains. Then I saw Jesus lead the redeemed company to the\ngate of the city. He laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its\nglittering hinges and bade the nations that had kept the truth enter\nin. Within the city there was everything to feast the eye. Rich glory\nthey beheld everywhere. Then Jesus looked upon His redeemed\nsaints; their countenances were radiant with glory; and as He fixed\nHis loving eyes upon them, He said, with His rich, musical voice,\n\u201cI behold the travail of My soul, and am satisfied. This rich glory\nis yours to enjoy eternally. Your sorrows are ended. There shall be\nno more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any[289]\nmore pain.\u201d I saw the redeemed host bow and cast their glittering\ncrowns at the feet of Jesus, and then, as His lovely hand raised them\nup, they touched their golden harps and filled all heaven with their\nrich music and songs to the Lamb.\nI then saw Jesus leading His people to the tree of life, and again\nwe heard His lovely voice, richer than any music that ever fell on\nmortal ear, saying, \u201cThe leaves of this tree are for the healing of the\nnations. Eat ye all of it.\u201d Upon the tree of life was most beautiful\nfruit, of which the saints could partake freely. In the city was a most\nglorious throne, from which proceeded a pure river of water of life,\nclear as crystal. On each side of this river was the tree of life, and on\nthe banks of the river were other beautiful trees bearing fruit which\nwas good for food.\n274\nSaints\u2019 Reward 275\nLanguage is altogether too feeble to attempt a description of\nheaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost in amazement.\nCarried away with the surpassing splendor and excellent glory, I lay\ndown the pen, and exclaim, \u201cOh, what love! what wondrous love!\u201d\nThe most exalted language fails to describe the glory of heaven or\nthe matchless depths of a Saviour\u2019s love.\nThe Earth Desolated\nMy attention was again directed to the earth. The wicked had\nbeen destroyed, and their dead bodies were lying upon its surface.\nThe wrath of God in the seven last plagues had been visited upon the\ninhabitants of the earth, causing them to gnaw their tongues from\npain and to curse God. The false shepherds had been the signal\nobjects of Jehovah\u2019s wrath. Their eyes had consumed away in their\nholes, and their tongues in their mouths, while they stood upon their[290]\nfeet. After the saints had been delivered by the voice of God, the\nwicked multitude turned their rage upon one another. The earth\nseemed to be deluged with blood, and dead bodies were from one\nend of it to the other.\nThe earth looked like a desolate wilderness. Cities and villages,\nshaken down by the earthquake, lay in heaps. Mountains had been\nmoved out of their places, leaving large caverns. Ragged rocks,\nthrown out by the sea, or torn out of the earth itself, were scattered\nall over its surface. Large trees had been uprooted and were strewn\nover the land. Here is to be the home of Satan with his evil angels\nfor a thousand years. Here he will be confined, to wander up and\ndown over the broken surface of the earth and see the effects of his\nrebellion against God\u2019s law. For a thousand years he can enjoy the\nfruit of the curse which he has caused. Limited alone to the earth,\nhe will not have the privilege of ranging to other planets, to tempt\nand annoy those who have not fallen. During this time, Satan suffers\nextremely. Since his fall his evil traits have been in constant exercise.\nBut he is then to be deprived of his power, and left to reflect upon\nthe part which he has acted since his fall, and to look forward with\ntrembling and terror to the dreadful future, when he must suffer for\nall the evil that he has done and be punished for all the sins that he\nhas caused to be committed.\nI heard shouts of triumph from the angels and from the redeemed\nsaints, which sounded like ten thousand musical instruments, be-\ncause they were to be no more annoyed and tempted by Satan and\n276\nEarth Desolated 277\nbecause the inhabitants of other worlds were delivered from his\npresence and his temptations.\nThen I saw thrones, and Jesus and the redeemed saints sat upon\nthem; and the saints reigned as kings and priests unto God. Christ, [291]\nin union with His people, judged the wicked dead, comparing their\nacts with the statute book, the Word of God, and deciding every\ncase according to the deeds done in the body. Then they meted\nout to the wicked the portion which they must suffer, according to\ntheir works; and it was written against their names in the book of\ndeath. Satan also and his angels were judged by Jesus and the saints.\nSatan\u2019s punishment was to be far greater than that of those whom\nhe had deceived. His suffering would so far exceed theirs as to bear\nno comparison with it. After all those whom he had deceived had\nperished, Satan was still to live and suffer on much longer.\nAfter the judgment of the wicked dead had been finished, at the\nend of the one thousand years, Jesus left the city, and the saints and\na train of the angelic host followed Him. Jesus descended upon a\ngreat mountain, which as soon as His feet touched it, parted asunder\nand became a mighty plain. Then we looked up and saw the great\nand beautiful city, with twelve foundations, and twelve gates, three\non each side, and an angel at each gate. We cried out, \u201cThe city! the\ngreat city! it is coming down from God out of heaven!\u201d And it came\ndown in all its splendor and dazzling glory and settled in the mighty\nplain which Jesus had prepared for it.\nThe Second Resurrection[292]\nThen Jesus and all the retinue of holy angels, and all the re-\ndeemed saints, left the city. The angels surrounded their Comman-\nder and escorted Him on His way, and the train of redeemed saints\nfollowed. Then, in terrible, fearful majesty, Jesus called forth the\nwicked dead; and they came up with the same feeble, sickly bodies\nthat went into the grave. What a spectacle! what a scene! At the\nfirst resurrection all came forth in immortal bloom; but at the second\nthe marks of the curse are visible on all. The kings and noblemen\nof the earth, the mean and low, the learned and unlearned, come\nforth together. All behold the Son of man; and those very men who\ndespised and mocked Him, who put the crown of thorns upon His\nsacred brow, and smote Him with the reed, behold Him in all His\nkingly majesty. Those who spit upon Him in the hour of His trial\nnow turn from His piercing gaze and from the glory of His counte-\nnance. Those who drove the nails through His hands and feet now\nlook upon the marks of His crucifixion. Those who thrust the spear\ninto His side behold the marks of their cruelty on His body. And\nthey know that He is the very one whom they crucified and derided\nin His expiring agony. And then there arises one long protracted\nwail of agony, as they flee to hide from the presence of the King of\nkings and Lord of lords.\nAll are seeking to hide in the rocks, to shield themselves from the\nterrible glory of Him whom they once despised. And, overwhelmed\nand pained with His majesty and exceeding glory, they with one\naccord raise their voices, and with terrible distinctness exclaim,\n\u201cBlessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord!\u201d\nThen Jesus and the holy angels, accompanied by all the saints,[293]\nagain go to the city, and the bitter lamentations and wailings of the\ndoomed wicked fill the air. Then I saw that Satan again commenced\nhis work. He passed around among his subjects, and made the\nweak and feeble strong, and told them that he and his angels were\npowerful. He pointed to the countless millions who had been raised.\n278\nSecond Resurrection 279\nThere were mighty warriors and kings who were well skilled in\nbattle and who had conquered kingdoms. And there were mighty\ngiants and valiant men who had never lost a battle. There was the\nproud, ambitious Napoleon, whose approach had caused kingdoms\nto tremble. There stood men of lofty stature and dignified bearing,\nwho had fallen in battle while thirsting to conquer. As they come\nforth from their graves, they resume the current of their thoughts\nwhere it ceased in death. They possess the same desire to conquer\nwhich ruled when they fell. Satan consults with his angels, and then\nwith those kings and conquerors and mighty men. Then he looks\nover the vast army, and tells them that the company in the city is\nsmall and feeble, and that they can go up and take it, and cast out its\ninhabitants, and possess its riches and glory themselves.\nSatan succeeds in deceiving them, and all immediately begin\nto prepare themselves for battle. There are many skillful men in\nthat vast army, and they construct all kinds of implements of war.\nThen with Satan at their head, the multitude move on. Kings and\nwarriors follow close after Satan, and the multitude follow after in\ncompanies. Each company has its leader, and order is observed as\nthey march over the broken surface of the earth to the Holy City.\nJesus closes the gates of the city, and this vast army surround it, and\nplace themselves in battle array, expecting a fierce conflict. Jesus\nand all the angelic host and all the saints, with the glittering crowns [294]\nupon their heads, ascend to the top of the wall of the city. Jesus\nspeaks with majesty, saying, \u201cBehold, ye sinners, the reward of the\njust! And behold, My redeemed, the reward of the wicked!\u201d The\nvast multitude behold the glorious company on the walls of the city.\nAnd as they witness the splendor of their glittering crowns and see\ntheir faces radiant with glory, reflecting the image of Jesus, and then\nbehold the unsurpassed glory and majesty of the King of kings and\nLord of lords, their courage fails. A sense of the treasure and glory\nwhich they have lost rushes upon them, and they realize that the\nwages of sin is death. They see the holy, happy company whom they\nhave despised, clothed with glory, honor, immortality, and eternal\nlife, while they are outside the city with every mean and abominable\nthing.\nThe Second Death\nSatan rushes into the midst of his followers and tries to stir up\nthe multitude to action. But fire from God out of heaven is rained\nupon them, and the great men, and mighty men, the noble, the\npoor and miserable, are all consumed together. I saw that some\nwere quickly destroyed, while others suffered longer. They were\npunished according to the deeds done in the body. Some were many\ndays consuming, and just as long as there was a portion of them\nunconsumed, all the sense of suffering remained. Said the angel,\n\u201cThe worm of life shall not die; their fire shall not be quenched as\nlong as there is the least particle for it to prey upon.\u201d\nSatan and his angels suffered long. Satan bore not only the\nweight and punishment of his own sins, but also of the sins of the[295]\nredeemed host, which had been placed upon him; and he must also\nsuffer for the ruin of souls which he had caused. Then I saw that\nSatan and all the wicked host were consumed, and the justice of God\nwas satisfied; and all the angelic host, and all the redeemed saints,\nwith a loud voice said, \u201cAmen!\u201d\nSaid the angel, \u201cSatan is the root, his children are the branches.\nThey are now consumed root and branch. They have died an ev-\nerlasting death. They are never to have a resurrection, and God\nwill have a clean universe.\u201d I then looked and saw the fire which\nhad consumed the wicked, burning up the rubbish and purifying the\nearth. Again I looked and saw the earth purified. There was not a\nsingle sign of the curse. The broken, uneven surface of the earth\nnow looked like a level, extensive plain. God\u2019s entire universe was\nclean, and the great controversy was forever ended. Wherever we\nlooked, everything upon which the eye rested was beautiful and holy.\nAnd all the redeemed host, old and young, great and small, cast\ntheir glittering crowns at the feet of their Redeemer, and prostrated\nthemselves in adoration before Him, and worshiped Him that liveth\nforever and ever. The beautiful new earth, with all its glory, was\nthe eternal inheritance of the saints. The kingdom and dominion,\n280\nSecond Death 281\nand the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, was then\ngiven to the saints of the Most High, who were to possess it forever,\neven forever and ever.\n282 Early Writings\nAppendix [296]\n[297]\nPages 13-20: \u201cMy First Vision\u201c.\u2014That which is presented in this\nchapter was first published by the editor of the Day-Star, January 24,\n1846, as \u201cA Letter from Sister Harmon\u201d dated \u201cPortland, Maine, De-\ncember 20, 1845.\u201d It appeared again in print in 1846, 1847, and 1851\nunder the title \u201cTo The Remnant Scattered Abroad.\u201d The present\ntitle was assigned in 1882 in the reprinting of Experience and Views.\nDetailed autobiographical accounts as published in 1860 and\n1885 present that which appears here as two distinct visions. See\n\u201cMy First Vision\u201d in Spiritual Gifts 2:30-35; Testimonies for the\nChurch 1:58-61; and \u201cVision of the New Earth,\u201d in Spiritual Gifts\n2:52-55; Testimonies 1:67-70.\nPages 15-20: Portrayal of Future Events.\u2014As Mrs. White de-\nscribed that which God revealed to her concerning future events, she\ndid so, at times, as one participating in these events, whether they\nwere in the past or the present or the future. In response to inquiries\nas to her state in vision, she wrote:\n\u201cWhen the Lord sees fit to give a vision, I am taken into the\npresence of Jesus and angels, and am entirely lost to earthly things....\nMy attention is often directed to scenes transpiring upon earth. At\ntimes I am carried far ahead into the future and shown what is to\ntake place. Then again I am shown things as they have occurred in\nthe past.\u201d\u2014Spiritual Gifts 2:292.\nEllen White, an Adventist herself, wrote as one present who saw\nand heard that which is yet to take place; E.G., Early Writings:\n\u201cSoon we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave\nus the day and hour of Jesus\u2019 coming.\u201d\u2014Page 15.\n284 Early Writings\n\u201cWe all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascend-\ning to the sea of glass, when Jesus brought the crowns, and with his\nown right hand placed them on our heads.\u201d\u2014Page 16.\n\u201cWe all marched in and felt that we had a perfect right in the\ncity.\u201d\n\u201cWe saw the tree of life and the throne of God.\u201d\n\u201cWith Jesus at our head we all descended from the city down to\nthis earth.\u201d\u2014Page 17.\n\u201cAs we were about to enter the holy temple\u201d....\n\u201cThe wonderful things I there saw I cannot describe.\u201d\u2014Page 19.\nAfter the vision she was able to recall much of what had been\nshown to her, but that which was secret, and not to be revealed, she\ncould not recall. As a part of the scene of what is to take place when\nGod\u2019s people are delivered (page 285), she heard announced \u201cthe\nday and hour of Jesus\u2019 coming\u201d (page 15; see also page 34). But of\nthis she later wrote: [298]\n\u201cI have not the slightest knowledge as to the time spoken by the\nvoice of God. I heard the hour proclaimed, but had no remembrance\nof that hour after I came out of vision. Scenes of such thrilling,\nsolemn interest passed before me, as no language is adequate to\ndescribe. It was all a living reality to me.\u201d\u2014Ellen G. White Letter\n38, 1888, published in Selected Messages 1, 76.\nThe fact that she seemed to be participating in certain events\noffered no guarantee that she would be a participant when the events\noccurred.\nPage 17: Brethren Fitch and Stockman.\u2014In the account of her\nfirst vision Mrs. White makes reference to \u201cBrethren Fitch and\nStockman\u201d as men she met and conversed with in the New Jerusalem.\nBoth were ministers with whom Ellen White had been acquainted\nand who had taken an active part in proclaiming the message of\nthe expected advent of Christ, but who had died shortly before the\ndisappointment of October 22, 1844.\nCharles Fitch, a Presbyterian minister, accepted the Advent mes-\nsage from reading William Miller\u2019s lectures and through his meeting\nwith Josiah Litch. He threw himself wholeheartedly into the procla-\nmation of the expected advent of Christ at the close of the 2300-year\nperiod, and became a prominent leader in the Advent Awakening. In\n1842 he designed the prophetic chart used so effectively and referred\nAppendix 285\nto in Early Writings, 74. He died a little more than a week before\nOctober 22, 1844. His death came about through illness contracted\nthrough over-exposure in conducting three baptismal services on\na chilly autumn day. (See Prophetic Faith of our Fathers, V ol. 4,\n533-545.)\nLevi F. Stockman was a youthful Methodist minister of the state\nof Maine who in 1842, with about thirty other Methodist ministers,\nembraced and began to preach the second advent of Christ. He was\nlaboring in Portland, Maine, when in 1843 his health failed. He died\nof tuberculosis on June 25, 1844. It was to him that Mrs. White, as\na girl, went for advice when in her discouragement God spoke to\nher in two dreams. (See Early Writings, 12, 78-81; Prophetic Faith\nof our Fathers, V ol. 4, 780-782.)\nPage 21: Mesmerism.\u2014In order to justify their opposition, some\nearly enemies of the visions suggested that Ellen White\u2019s experience\nwas brought about through mesmerism, a phenomenon known today\nas hypnosis. Hypnosis is a state resembling sleep, induced through\nthe power of suggestion, the hypnotized subject being in rapport with\nthe one inducing the state and responsive to his suggestions. When,\nhowever, as Mrs. White here reports, a mesmerizing physician\nattempted to hypnotize her, he was helpless in her presence.\nEllen White early in her experience was cautioned regarding the\nperils of hypnosis, and in later years, on a number of occasions, she [299]\nreceived instruction regarding it. She warned of the grave dangers\naccompanying any practice in which one mind would control another\nmind. (See The Ministry of Healing, 242-244; Medical Ministry,\n110-112; Selected Messages, 2:349, 350, 353.)\nPage 33: Nominal Adventists.\u2014Those who united in sounding\nthe first and second angels\u2019 messages but who rejected the third\nangel\u2019s message with its Sabbath truth, but nonetheless continued\nto espouse the Advent hope, are referred to by Mrs. White as the\n\u201cnominal Adventists,\u201d or those who \u201creject the present truth\u201d (Page\n69), also \u201cdifferent parties of professed Advent believers\u201d (Page\n124). In our early literature these people were also referred to as\n\u201cFirst-day Adventists.\u201d\nA large number of Christians were disappointed in the autumn\nof 1844 when Christ did not come as they expected. The Adventists\ndivided into several groups, the survivors of which today comprise\n286 Early Writings\nthe Advent Christian Church, a small body, and the Seventh-day\nAdventists.\nOnly a few among the Adventists maintained their confidence\nin the fulfillment of prophecy in 1844, but those who did stepped\nforward into the third angel\u2019s message with its Seventh-day Sabbath.\nOf the experience at that critical period Ellen White later wrote:\n\u201cHad Adventists, after the Great Disappointment in 1844, held\nfast their faith, and followed on unitedly in the opening providence\nof God, receiving the message of the third angel and in the power\nof the Holy Spirit proclaiming it to the world, they would have seen\nthe salvation of God, the Lord would have wrought mightily with\ntheir efforts, the work would have been completed, and Christ would\nhave come ere this to receive his people to their reward.\n\u201cBut in the period of doubt and uncertainty that followed the\nDisappointment, many of the Advent believers yielded their faith.\nDissensions and divisions came in. The majority opposed with voice\nand pen the few who, following in the providence of God, received\nthe Sabbath reform and began to proclaim the third angel\u2019s message.\nMany who should have devoted their time and talents to the one pur-\npose of sounding warning to the world, were absorbed in opposing\nthe Sabbath truth, and in turn, the labor of its advocates was neces-\nsarily spent in answering these opponents and defending the truth.\nThus the work was hindered, and the world was left in darkness.\nHad the whole Adventist body united upon the commandments of\nGod and the faith of Jesus, how widely different would have been\nour history!\u201d\u2014Selected Messages 1:68.\nPages 42-45: Open and Shut Door.\u2014As Mrs. White discussed\nthe great Advent movement and the Disappointment of October 22,\n1844, in The Great Controversy and referred to the positions taken\nimmediately after the disappointment, she makes mention of the[300]\ninevitable conclusion that was held for a short time that \u201cthe door\nof mercy was shut.\u201d But as she states, \u201cclearer light came with the\ninvestigation of the sanctuary question.\u201d See \u201cHistorical Prologue\u201d in\nthis volume and The Great Controversy, 429, and the entire chapter\n\u201cIn the Holy of Holies,\u201d pages 423-432.\nConcerning her own personal relationship to this matter, she\nwrote in 1874 that she \u201cnever had a vision that no more sinners\nwould be converted.\u201d Nor did she ever teach this view. \u201cIt was the\nAppendix 287\nlight given me of God,\u201d she wrote at another time, \u201cthat corrected our\nerror, and enabled us to see the true position.\u201d (Selected Messages\n1:74, 63.)\nPages 43, 44, and 86: Mysterious Knockings in New York, and\nRochester Knockings.\u2014Reference is here made to incidents relat-\ning to the beginnings of modern spiritualism. In 1848 mysterious\nrappings were heard in the home of the Fox family at Hydesville,\na community about thirty-five miles east of the city of Rochester,\nNew York. At a time when there were various conjectures as to the\ncause of the rappings, Ellen White announced, on the authority of\nthe vision given to her, that they were a manifestation of spiritualism,\nthat this phenomenon would develop rapidly, and in the name of\nreligion would gain popularity and deceive multitudes, developing\ninto Satan\u2019s last-day masterpiece of deception.\nPage 50: Messengers without a Message.\u2014This expression ap-\npears in an account of a view given to Ellen White on January 26,\n1850. At this time the Sabbathkeeping Adventists had no church\norganization. Nearly all were fearful that any type of organization\nwould bring in formality among the believers. But as time went on,\ndiscordant elements began to make their way into the ranks. Mes-\nsages of warning came from Ellen White, and the Sabbathkeeping\nAdventists were led step by step to adopt the forms of church orga-\nnization. As a result the companies of believers were knit together\nmore closely than before; a way was devised to give recognition\nto ministers who gave evidence that they could preach the message\nand support it with their lives; and provision was made to cast out\nthose who, under the pretext of presenting truth, taught error. See\n\u201cHistorical Prologue.\u201d\nPages 61, 62: Unity of the Shepherds.\u2014See note for page 50,\nMessengers without a Message.\nPage 75: Duty to go to Old Jerusalem.\u2014Mrs. White refers to\nerroneous views then held by a very few. The next year, in The\nReview and Herald, October 7, 1851, James White writes of \u201cthe\ndistracting, unprofitable views relative to old Jerusalem and the\nJews, etc., that are afloat at the present time,\u201d and of \u201cthe strange\nnotions that some have run into, that the saints have yet to go to old\nJerusalem. Etc., etc.\u201d\n288 Early Writings\nPage 77: Editor of the Day-Star.\u2014Enoch Jacobs lived in\nCincinnati, Ohio, and published the Day-Star, one of the early jour-[301]\nnals proclaiming the second advent of Christ. It was to Enoch Jacobs\nthat Ellen Harmon in December, 1845, sent an account of her first\nvision, hoping to stabilize him. She had observed that he was waver-\ning in his confidence in God\u2019s leadership in the Advent experience.\nIt was in the Day-Star that the editor published Mrs. White\u2019s first\nvision, in the issue of January 24, 1846. In a special number of his\njournal, the Day-Star Extra, February 7, 1846, the memorable article\nconcerning the heavenly sanctuary and its cleansing, prepared by\nHiram Edson, Dr. Hahn, and O. R. L. Crozier, was published. It set\nforth the scripture teaching relative to the ministry of Christ in the\nmost holy place of the heavenly sanctuary beginning October 22,\n1844. In this journal also on March 14, 1846, a second communica-\ntion from Ellen Harmon\u2019s pen was published. (see Early Writings,\n32-35.) Reference in the paragraph under discussion is to later views\nheld by Mr. Jacobs and the spiritualistic delusions he espoused.\nPage 86: See Appendix note for pages 43, 44.\nPage 89: Thomas Paine.\u2014The writings of Thomas Paine were\nwell known and widely read in the United States in the 1840\u2019s. His\nbook Age of Reason was a deistic work and detrimental to Christian\nfaith and practice. The book began with the words \u201cI believe in one\nGod and no more.\u201d Paine had no faith in Christ, and he was used\nsuccessfully by Satan in his attacks upon the church. As Mrs. White\nindicated, if such a man as Paine could find entrance to heaven and\nbe highly honored there, any sinner, without a reformation of life\nand without faith in Jesus Christ, could find admittance. She exposed\nthis fallacy in vigorous language and pointed out the irrationality of\nspiritualism.\nPage 101: Perfectionism.\u2014Some of the early Adventists, shortly\nafter the 1844 experience, lost their hold on God and drifted into\nfanaticism. Ellen White met these extremists with a \u201cthus saith the\nLord.\u201d She rebuked those who taught a state of perfection in the\nflesh and therefore could not sin. Of such Mrs. White later wrote:\n\u201cThey held that those who are sanctified cannot sin. And this\nnaturally led to the belief that the affections and desires of the sanc-\ntified ones were always right, and never in danger of leading them\ninto sin. In harmony with these sophistries, they were practising\nAppendix 289\nthe worst sins under the garb of sanctification, and through their\ndeceptive, mesmeric influence were gaining a strange power over\nsome of their associates, who did not see the evil of these apparently\nbeautiful but seductive theories....\n\u201cClearly the deceptions of these false teachers were laid open\nbefore me, and I saw the fearful account that stood against them in\nthe book of records, and the terrible guilt that rested upon them for\nprofessing complete holiness while their daily acts were offensive\nin the sight of God.\u201d\u2014Life Sketches, 83, 84. [302]\nPages 116 and 117: The Lord\u2019s Supper; Women Washing Men\u2019s\nFeet, and the Holy Kiss.\u2014The pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist\nchurch, having accepted the Sabbath truth, eagerly reached out to\nfollow the Word of God in every particular, while at the same time\nthey were careful to protect themselves against distorted interpreta-\ntions of the Word and any extremes or fanaticism. They saw clearly\nthe privileges and the obligations of the Lord\u2019s Supper established\nfor the church by our Lord. There was some question about foot\nwashing and the holy kiss. In this vision the Lord made clear certain\ndelicate points that would guide and guard the emerging church.\nAs to the matter of the frequency with which the ordinances\nshould be observed, some insisted on once a year; but the instruction\nwas given that the Lord\u2019s Supper should be more frequently prac-\nticed. Today the church follows the plan of observing the ordinances\nfour times annually.\nCounsel was given concerning the washing of feet. Apparently\nthere were some differences of opinion as to the procedure to be fol-\nlowed. Some had moved injudiciously and the result had been \u201ccon-\nfusion.\u201d Counsel was given that this ordinance should be performed\nwith care and reserve, in such a way as not to arouse prejudice.\nThere was some question about the propriety of men and women\nwashing one another\u2019s feet. On this point Ellen White brought forth\nscripture evidence which indicated that it would be proper for a\nwoman\u2014apparently under certain conditions\u2014to wash the feet of a\nman, but she counseled against a man washing the feet of a woman.\nConcerning the holy kiss, the SDA Bible Commentary states:\n\u201cIn the East, especially, the kiss was a common mode of express-\ning love and friendship in greeting. (See Luke 7:45; Acts 20:37.)\nThe \u2018holy kiss,\u2019 or \u2018kiss of charity\u2019 (1 Peter 5:14), was a symbol of\n290 Early Writings\nChristian affection. It seems to have become a custom with early\nChristians to exchange this greeting at the time of the Lord\u2019s Sup-\nper (Justin Martyr First Apology 65). Later writings indicate that it\nwas not the custom to give this \u2018holy kiss\u2019 to one of the opposite\nsex (Apostolic Constitutions ii. 57; viii. 11).\u201d\u2014 The S.D.A. Bible\nCommentary 7:257, 258.\nIt was the custom among the early Sabbathkeeping Adventists\nto exchange the holy kiss at the ordinance of humility. No refer-\nence is made to obvious impropriety of exchanging the holy kiss\nbetween men and women, but there is a call for all to abstain from\nall appearance of evil.\nPage 118: Making a Noise.\u2014The gospel net draws in all types\nof people. There were some who felt that their religious experience\nwas not genuine unless marked by noisy, demonstrative shouts of\npraise to God, loud and excited prayers, and animated amens. Here\nagain the church in its early experience was given a note of warning,\ncalling for decorum and solemnity in the worship of God. [303]\nPages 229-232: William Miller.\u2014In the references to the great\nAdvent Awakening in America in the 1830\u2019s and 1840\u2019s, William\nMiller is often mentioned. In the book The Great Controversy an\nentire chapter is devoted to the life and ministry of William Miller\nunder the title \u201cAn American Reformer\u201d (pages 317-342). William\nMiller was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 1782 and died in\nLow Hampton, New York, in 1849. At the age of four he moved with\nhis parents to Low Hampton, New York, near Lake Champlain and\ngrew up on a frontier farm. He was always studious and a careful\nreader. He became a leader in his community. In 1816 he set about\nto give careful study to the Word of God, and his study led him to\nthe great time prophecies and the prophecies relating to the Second\nAdvent. He concluded that the second coming of Christ was near.\nAfter reviewing his positions over a period of years and assuring\nhimself as to their certainty, he responded in early August, 1831, to\nan invitation to publicly present his views on the prophecies. From\nthen on his time was devoted largely to the heralding of the Advent\nmessage. In due time he was joined by hundreds of other Protestant\nministers who participated in the great Advent Awakening of the\n1840\u2019s.\nAppendix 291\nAt the time of the disappointment on October 22, 1844, Miller\nwas worn and ill. He depended largely on his younger associates\nwho stood with him in proclaiming the Advent message. They led\nhim to reject the Sabbath truth as it came to his attention soon after\nthe Disappointment. For this they, and not William Miller, will be\nheld responsible. Ellen White writes of this experience on page 258,\nand assures us that Miller will be among those who will be called\nfrom their graves at the sound of the last trump.\nPages 232-240, 254-258: Three Angels\u2019 Messages of Revelation\n14.\u2014In a series of three chapters, beginning on page 232, Ellen\nWhite discusses the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. She\nwas writing for those who with her had passed through the great\nAdvent Awakening and the disappointments of the spring and fall\nof 1844. She did not attempt to enter into an explanation of these\nthree messages, but assumed that her readers had a full knowledge\nof this experience. She presented that which would bring courage\nand understanding to her fellow believers in the light of their ex-\nperience. We must turn to her book The Great Controversy for a\ndetailed account of the burden of these messages. The first angel\u2019s\nmessage sounded the warning of the approach of the hour of God\u2019s\njudgment. See The Great Controversy, chapters \u201cHeralds of the\nMorning,\u201d Pages 299-316; \u201cAn American Reformer,\u201d pages 317-\n342; and \u201cA Great Religious Awakening,\u201d Pages 355-374. For the\npresentation of the message of the second angel, see the chapter\n\u201cA Warning Rejected,\u201d beginning on page 375. The account of the\nDisappointment is presented in the chapters \u201cProphecies Fulfilled,\u201d\nPages 391-408; \u201cWhat is the Sanctuary?\u201d pages 409-422; and \u201cThe [304]\nHoly of Holies,\u201d pages 423-432. The third angel\u2019s message is set\nforth in the chapter \u201cGod\u2019s Law Immutable,\u201d pages 433-450; and \u201cA\nWork of Reform,\u201d pages 451-460.\nPage 238: Close of the Second Angel\u2019s Message .\u2014While we\nunderstand clearly that the messages of the first and second and third\nangels are messages that have their application today, we recognize\nalso that in their initial proclamation the sounding of the first angel\u2019s\nmessage with its declaration that \u201cthe hour of God\u2019s judgment is\ncome\u201d is linked with the proclamation of the expected advent of\nChrist in the 1830\u2019s and early 1840\u2019s. The second angel\u2019s message\nhad its initial sounding early in the summer of 1844 in the call to\n292 Early Writings\nthe Advent believers to come out of the nominal churches that had\nrejected the proclamation of the first angel\u2019s message. And while\nit is true that the second angel\u2019s message continues to be present\ntruth, there was a climactic closing up of the second angel\u2019s message\nimmediately preceding October 22, 1844. When the messages of the\nthree angels come prominently before the world again just before\nthe second advent of Christ, the angel of Revelation 18:1 joins in\nthe proclamation of the second angel in the message that \u201cBabylon\nis fallen.\u201d \u201cCome out of her, my people.\u201d See the chapter \u201cThe Final\nWarning\u201d in The Great Controversy, 603-612.\nPage 254: See Appendix note for pages 232-240.\nPage 276: Slaves and Master.\u2014According to Revelation 6:15,\n16 there will be slavery at the second advent of Christ. Here we find\nthe words \u201cevery bondman, and every free man.\u201d The statement by\nEllen White under discussion indicates that she was shown in vision\nthe slave and the slave master at the second advent of Christ. In this\nshe is in perfect accord with the Bible. Both John and Mrs. White\nwere shown conditions that would exist at the second coming of our\nLord. While it is true that Negro slaves in the United States were\nfreed by the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect six\nyears after the statement under discussion was penned, the message\nis not made invalid, for even today there are millions of men and\nwomen in actual or virtual slavery in different parts of the world. It\nis not possible to pass judgment on a prophecy of the future until we\nhave reached the time for the fulfillment of that prophecy.",
