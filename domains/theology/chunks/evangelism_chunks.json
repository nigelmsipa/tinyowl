We are in time\u2019s closing hours, and the Advent\nmessage, proclaimed to make ready a people prepared for our Lord\u2019s\nreturn, must swell to a loud cry reaching the uttermost parts of the\nearth.\nSince the early days of the work of Seventh-day Adventists, the\nSpirit of prophecy instruction placing special emphasis upon the\nprinciples and practice of soul winning has been given to guide in an\nexpanding work. Some phases of evangelism have been delineated\nin nearly all the Ellen G. White books. Through the years, in the\nReview and Herald, Signs of the Times, and other journals, articles\nfrom the Lord\u2019s messenger have given impetus to a growing evange-\nlistic ministry. Individual evangelists were also, from time to time,\nfavored in receiving instruction and warning regarding methods that\nshould characterize their labor. Occasionally groups of evangelists\nand denominational administrators were addressed by Mrs. White,\nand these addresses often embodied much helpful counsel.\nBut these periodical articles, special testimonies, personal coun-\nsels, and addresses are not generally available today. It is to make\nthis full body of timely instruction accessible to our present greatly\nenlarged Seventh-day Adventist evangelistic force that there is now\nissued this comprehensive, topically arranged compilation. Devoted [6]\nexclusively to the all-important subject of evangelism.\nThis volume not only sets forth the well-established guiding\nprinciples which should mold the work of the evangelist and Bible\ninstructor but also presents a wealth of minute counsel regarding the\napplication of those principles. As a compilation of the precious\ninstruction which the Lord has given all through the years, it is a\nveritable handbook of evangelism for the Advent movement.\nIn bringing together and arranging in logical order many state-\nments from various sources, it was found that certain general lines of\niii\ninstruction were repeatedly set forth. In the effort to place before the\nreader all that contributed to the subject, without presenting undue\nrepetition, only paragraphs or groups of paragraphs were selected.\nIn some cases repetitious sentences were dropped from even the\nbrief excerpts used, and in each case the deletion is indicated. Great\ncare has been exercised, however, to present statements of sufficient\nlength to give the correct setting for the counsel.\nAn endeavor has been made to make each section a complete\ntreatment of the subject presented. In so doing there accrues a cer-\ntain degree of unavoidable repetition of thought which emphasizes\nthe instruction. As an aid in making ready reference to the key\nstatements in this volume, side headings appearing in bold type have\nbeen supplied by the compilers. A source credit appears at the close\nof each excerpt, and as a further aid to the reader, there is given the\ndate of writing, in case of the manuscript quotations, or the date of\nfirst publication in the case of other reference.\nA knowledge of the time of the utterance sometimes serves as a[7]\nhelpful guide to the application of the counsel, for our work must\nbe conducted under changing conditions. And although in some\ninstances it may not be possible to employ in minute detail methods\nadvocated in earlier years, yet the basic principles enunciated or\nillustrated in these earlier counsels will today be a guide to safe and\nfruitful methods. Principle is changeless, though its application may\ncall for an adjustment and adaptation to meet present conditions. We\npresent a concrete illustration of this point.\nThe reader will find frequent mention of the camp meeting, and\ncounsel as to its conduct. In the seventies Seventh-day Adventist\ncamp meetings attracted very large non-Adventist week-end atten-\ndance, with congregations ranging from half church members and\nhalf non-Adventists to the unusual ratio of fifteen non-Adventists\nto one church member. In the nineties very successful evangelistic\ncamp meetings held in the suburbs of large cities lasted from two\nweeks to a month. Such meetings were of large soul-winning po-\ntentiality. Many statements commending such meetings and giving\ninstruction regarding their successful conduct were penned through\nthose years.\nBut times have changed; the camp meeting has become a gather-\ning almost exclusively for an enlarging church group. The non-Ad-\nventist throngs attracted in earlier years by the camp meeting are now\nreached more effectively through the tent or hall meeting. Neverthe-\nless, the principles guiding to successful methods in the evangelistic\ncamp meetings serve safely and well in leading to fruitful methods\nin present-day evangelism.\nThe instruction in this book is restricted almost entirely to the\nevangelistic work of the minister and the Bible instructor. The volu-\nminous counsel in regard to lay evangelism, set forth so fully in other [8]\nE. G. White productions, also guidance on literature evangelism\nwhich fills such an important place in our work, are not repeated\nhere because of space limitations. Likewise, medical evangelism,\ntreated so fully and well in Ministry of Healing, Medical Ministry,\nand Counsels on Health, is not dwelt upon except as it relates to the\npublic presentation of the message. Much more might be included\non the qualifications of the evangelist, but the quotations on this\ntopic are here limited to such points as have a direct bearing on his\nspecial work.\nThis volume is now sent into the field with the conviction that its\nappearance will mark a definite advance in methods of evangelism.\nIts constructive, up-to-date counsel, its timely cautions, its views of\nthe triumph of the message, will, we believe, constitute a \u201cblueprint,\u201d\nguiding an evangelism that will reach its glorious climax under the\nloud cry of the third angel.\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

dis-\nciples were: \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the\nworld.\u201d \u201cGo ye therefore, and teach all nations.\u201d Go to the farthest\nbounds of the habitable globe, and know that wherever you go My\npresence will attend you....\nTo us also the commission is given. We are bidden to go forth\nas Christ\u2019s messengers, to teach, instruct, and persuade men and\nwomen, to urge upon their attention the word of life. And to us also\nthe assurance of Christ\u2019s abiding presence is given. Whatever the\ndifficulties with which we may have to contend, whatever the trials\nwe may have to endure, the gracious promise is always ours, \u201cLo, I\nam with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d\u2014Manuscript\n24, 1903.\nThe Message a Living Force\u2014In the commission to His disci-\nples, Christ not only outlined their work but gave them their message.\nTeach the people, He said, \u201cto observe all things whatsoever I have\ncommanded you.\u201d The disciples were to teach what Christ had taught.\nThat which He had spoken, not only in person, but through all the\nprophets and teachers of the Old Testament, is here included. Hu-\nman teachings is shut out. There is no place for tradition, for man\u2019s\ntheories and conclusions, or for church legislation. No laws ordained\nby ecclesiastical authority are included in the commission. None of[16]\nthese are Christ\u2019s servants to teach. \u201cThe law and the prophets,\u201d with\nthe record of His own words and deeds, are the treasure committed\nto the disciples to be given to the world....\nThe gospel is to be presented, not as a lifeless theory, but as a\nliving force to change the life. God desires that the receivers of His\ngrace shall be witnesses to its power.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 826\n(1898).\nThe Church Entrusted With the Message\u2014We are now living\nin the closing scenes of this world\u2019s history. Let men tremble with\nthe sense of the responsibility of knowing the truth. The ends of the\n14\nProclaiming the Message 15\nworld are come. Proper consideration of these things will lead all\nto make an entire consecration of all that they have and are to their\nGod....\nThe weighty obligation of warning a world of its coming doom\nis upon us. From every direction, far and near, calls are coming to\nus for help. The church, devotedly consecrated to the work, is to\ncarry the message to the world: Come to the gospel feast; the supper\nis prepared, come.... Crowns, immortal crowns, are to be won. The\nkingdom of heaven is to be gained. A world, perishing in sin, is to\nbe enlightened. The lost pearl is to be found. The lost sheep is to\nbe brought back in safety to the fold. Who will join in the search?\nWho will bear the light to those who are wandering in the darkness\nof error?\u2014The Review and Herald, July 23, 1895.\nThe Present Crisis\u2014We should now feel the responsibility of\nlaboring with intense earnestness to impart to others the truths that\nGod has given for this time. We cannot be too much in earnest....\nNow is the time for the last warning to be given. There is a\nspecial power in the presentation of the truth at the present time; but [17]\nhow long will it continue?\u2014Only a little while. If there was ever a\ncrisis, it is now.\nAll are now deciding their eternal destiny. Men need to be\naroused to realize the solemnity of the time, the nearness of the\nday when human probation shall be ended. Decided efforts should\nbe made to bring the message for this time prominently before the\npeople. The third angel is to go forth with great power.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:16 (1900).\nEvangelism Our Real Work\u2014Evangelistic work, opening the\nScriptures to others, warning men and women of what is coming\nupon the world, is to occupy more and still more of the time of God\u2019s\nservants.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 2, 1906.\nSpeeding the Message\u2014As a people we greatly need to humble\nour hearts before God, pleading His forgiveness for our neglect to\nfulfill the gospel commission. We have made large centers in a few\nplaces, leaving unworked many important cities. Let us now take up\nthe work appointed us, and proclaim the message that is to arouse\nmen and women to a sense of their danger. If every Seventh-day\nAdventist had done the work laid upon him, the number of believers\n16 Evangelism\nwould now be much larger than it is.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n9:25 (1909).\nThe Call for Earnest Work \u2014If our ministers realized how\nsoon the inhabitants of the world are to be arraigned before the\njudgment seat of God, to answer for the deeds done in the body,\nhow earnestly they would work together with God to present the\ntruth! How earnestly they would strive to lead men to accept the\ntruth. How untiringly they would labor to advance God\u2019s cause in\nthe world, proclaiming in word and deed, \u201cThe end of all things is[18]\nat hand.\u201d\u2014Letter 43, 1902.\nAmid Confusion of Last Days\u2014The words of Jesus Christ are\nspoken to us living down here in the close of this earth\u2019s history.\n\u201cWhen these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up\nyour heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\u201d The nations are in\nunrest. Times of perplexity are upon us. The waves of the sea are\nroaring; men\u2019s hearts are failing them for fear and for expectation of\nthose things that are coming upon the earth; but those who believe\non the Son of God will hear His voice amid the storm, saying, \u201cIt is I;\nbe not afraid\u201d.... We see the world lying in wickedness and apostasy.\nRebellion to the commandments of God seems almost universal.\nAmid the tumult of excitement with confusion in every place, there\nis a work to be done in the world.\u2014Manuscript 44, 1900.\nPlanting the Standard in Dark Places \u2014Satan\u2019s armies are\nmany, and God\u2019s people must spread over all the world, planting\nthe standard of truth in the dark places of the earth and doing their\nutmost to destroy Satan\u2019s kingdom.\u2014Letter 91, 1900.\nThe Highest, Greatest Work\u2014The Lord designs that the pre-\nsentation of this message shall be the highest, greatest work carried\non in the world at this time.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:11\n(1900).\nMore Rapid Advancement \u2014In this country and in foreign\ncountries the cause of present truth is to make more rapid advance-\nment than it has yet made. If our people will go forth in faith, doing\nwhatever they can to make a beginning, and laboring in Christ\u2019s\nlines, the way will be opened before them. If they will show the\nenergy that is necessary in order to gain success, and the faith that[19]\ngoes forward unquestioningly in obedience to God\u2019s command, rich\nreturns will be theirs. They must go as far and as fast as possible,\nProclaiming the Message 17\nwith a determination to do the very things that the Lord has said\nshould be done. They must have push and earnest, unwavering\nfaith.... The world must hear the warning message.\u2014Manuscript\n162, 1905.\nEver-Widening Influence of the Gospel\nBelting the Earth \u2014Everywhere the light of truth is to shine\nforth, that hearts now in the sleep of ignorance may be awakened and\nconverted. In all countries and cities the gospel is to be proclaimed....\nChurches are to be organized and plans laid for work to be done\nby the members of the newly organized churches. This gospel\nmissionary work is to keep reaching out and annexing new territory,\nenlarging the cultivated portions of the vineyard. The circle is to\nextend until it belts the world.\u2014Letter 86, 1902.\nNorth, South, East, and West\u2014From town to town, from city\nto city, from country to country, the warning message is to be pro-\nclaimed, not with outward display, but in the power of the Spirit, by\nmen of faith.\nAnd it is necessary that the best kind of labor be given. The time\nhas come, the important time, when, through God\u2019s messengers, the\nscroll is being unrolled to the world. The truth comprised in the first,\nsecond, and third angels\u2019 messages must go to every nation, kindred,\ntongue, and people; it must lighten the darkness of every continent\nand extend to the islands of the sea....\nLet there be the wisest planning for the success of the work.\nDecided efforts should be made to open new fields in the north, the[20]\nsouth, the east, and the west.... The fact that the presentation of the\ntruth has been so long neglected should appeal to our ministers and\nworkers to enter these fields and not give up the work until they have\nclearly given the message.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1908.\nUnchecked by Barriers or Obstacles\u2014Truth, passing by those\nwho despise and reject it, will triumph. Although at times apparently\nretarded, its progress had never been checked. When the message\nof God meets with opposition, He gives it additional force, that it\nmay exert greater influence. Endowed with divine energy, it will\ncut its way through the strongest barriers, and triumph over every\nobstacle.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles, 601 (1911).\n18\nEver-Widening Influence of the Gospel 19\nA Substantial Work\u2014The work that the gospel embraces as\nmissionary work is a straightforward, substantial work which will\nshine brighter and brighter unto the perfect day.\u2014Letter 215b, 1899.\nAn Influence That Deepens and Widens \u2014The influence of\nthese messages has been deepening and widening, setting in motion\nthe springs of action in thousands of hearts, bringing into existence\ninstitutions of learning, publishing houses, and health institutions;\nall these are the instrumentalities of God to co-operate in the grand\nwork represented by the first, second, and third angels flying in the\nmidst of heaven to warn the inhabitants of the world that Christ is\ncoming again with power and great glory.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nDecember 6, 1892.\nProclaim Message in New Fields \u2014We have a most solemn,\ntesting message to give to the world. But too much time has been\ngiven to those who already know the truth. In the place of spending\ntime on those who have been given many opportunities to learn the [21]\ntruth, go to the people who have never heard your message. Hold\nyour camp meetings [Note.\u2014Seventh-day Adventist camp meetings\nof earlier years were great evangelistic agencies drawing large, at-\ntentive, non-Adventist audiences. In the frequent mention of camp\nmeetings in this volume the context clearly indicates that it is the tent\nmeeting of large evangelistic potentialities that is usually referred\nto. See pages 82, 83 for statements describing such meetings.] in\ncities where the truth has not been proclaimed. Some will attend the\nmeetings and receive the message.\u2014Letter 87, 1896.\nNew Places the Best Places\u2014The places in which the truth has\nnever been proclaimed are the best places in which to work. The\ntruth is to take possession of the will of those who have never before\nheard it. They will see the sinfulness of sin, and their repentance\nwill be thorough and sincere. The Lord will work upon hearts that\nin the past have not often been appealed to, hearts that heretofore\nhave not seen the enormity of sin.\u2014Letter 106, 1903.\nIf Truth Had Been Aggressively Proclaimed \u2014There was\nspread out before me city after city in need of evangelistic labors. If\ndiligent effort had been given to the work of making known the truth\nfor this time in the cities that are unwarned, they would not now be\nas impenitent as they are. From the light that has been given me I\nknow that we might have had today thousands more rejoicing in the\n20 Evangelism\ntruth if the work had been carried forward as the situation demands,\nin many aggressive lines.\u2014Letter 94a, 1909.\nThe Need of Evangelistic Workers\nThe Harvest Is Great\u2014The solemn, sacred message of warning\nmust be proclaimed in the most difficult fields and in the most sinful\ncities, in every place where the light of the great threefold gospel [22]\nmessage has not yet dawned. Everyone is to hear the last call to the\nmarriage supper of the Lamb....\nCountries hitherto closed to the gospel are opening their doors,\nand are pleading for the Word of God to be explained to them. Kings\nand princes are opening their long-closed gates, inviting the heralds\nof the cross to enter. The harvest truly is great. Eternity alone will\nreveal the results of well-directed efforts put forth now.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 27 (1915).\nAmbassadors for Christ\u2014Ministers of God, with hearts aglow\nwith love for Christ and your fellow men, seek to arouse those who\nare dead in trespasses and sins. Let your earnest entreaties and\nwarnings pierce their consciences. Let your fervent prayers melt\ntheir hearts, and lead them in penitence to the Saviour. You are\nambassadors for Christ, to proclaim His message of salvation.\u2014\nGospel Workers, 35 (1915).\nA Hundred Workers Where Now Is One \u2014Time is short.\nWorkers for Christ are needed everywhere. There should be one\nhundred earnest, faithful laborers in home and foreign mission fields\nwhere now there is one. The highways and the byways are yet un-\nworked. Urgent inducements should be held out to those who ought\nnow to be engaged in missionary work for the Master.\u2014Fundamen-\ntals of Christian Education, 488 (1903).\nA Wise Distribution of Men\u2014For the accomplishment of all\nthat God calls for in warning the cities, His servants must plan for\na wise distribution of the working forces. Often the laborers who\nmight be a power for good in public meetings, are engaged in other\nwork that allows them no time for active ministry among the people.\nFor the conduct of affairs at the various centers of our work, those in\nresponsibility must endeavor, as far as possible, to find consecrated [23]\n21\n22 Evangelism\nmen who have been trained in business lines. There is constant\nnecessity of guarding against the tendency to tie up at these centers\nof influence men who could do a larger and more important work on\nthe public platform, in presenting before unbelievers the truths of\nGod\u2019s Word.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 7, 1910.\nThe Highest Calling\u2014There must be no belittling of the gospel\nministry. No enterprise should be so conducted as to cause the\nministry of the Word to be looked upon as an inferior matter. It is\nnot so. Those who belittle the ministry are belittling Christ. The\nhighest of all work is ministry in its various lines, and it should be\nkept before the youth that there is no work more blessed of God than\nthat of the gospel minister.\nLet not our young men be deterred from entering the ministry.\nThere is danger that through glowing representations some will be\ndrawn away from the path where God bids them walk. Some have\nbeen encouraged to take a course of study in medical lines who ought\nto be preparing themselves to enter the ministry.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 6:411 (1900).\nYouth Replacing Standard-Bearers \u2014The standard-bearers\nare falling, and young men must be prepared to take the places\nleft vacant, that the message may still be proclaimed. The aggressive\nwarfare is to be extended. Those who have youth and strength are\nto go into the dark places of the earth, to call perishing souls to\nrepentance.\u2014Gospel Workers, 104 (1915).\nTo Speedily Prepare for Service\u2014Our schools have been es-\ntablished by the Lord, and if they are conducted in harmony with His\npurpose, the youth sent to them will quickly be prepared to engage in\nvarious lines of missionary work. Some will be trained to enter the\nfield as missionary nurses, some as canvassers, some as evangelists,[24]\nsome as teachers, and some as gospel ministers.\u2014Letter 113, 1903.\nTeach Them to Do Evangelistic Work\u2014The Lord calls upon\nthose connected with our sanitariums, publishing houses, and\nschools to teach the youth to do evangelistic work. Our time and\nenergy must not be so largely employed in establishing sanitari-\nums, food stores, and restaurants that other lines of work will be\nneglected. Young men and young women who should be engaged\nin the ministry, in Bible work, and in the canvassing work should\nNeed of Evangelistic Workers 23\nnot be bound down to mechanical employment.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, May 16, 1912.\nThe Call to Strong Young Men\u2014Where are the men who will\ngo forth to the work, fully trusting in God, ready to do and to dare?\nGod calls, \u201cSon, go work today in My vineyard.\u201d God will make the\nyoung men of today heaven\u2019s chosen repositories, to present before\nthe people truth in contrast with error and superstition, if they will\ngive themselves to Him. May God roll the burden on strong young\nmen, who have His word abiding in them and who will give the truth\nto others.\u2014Manuscript 134, 1898.\nMen Who Will Not Draw Back \u2014God calls for consecrated\nworkers who will be true to Him\u2014humble men who see the need of\nevangelistic work and do not draw back but do each day\u2019s work faith-\nfully, relying upon God for help and strength in every emergency.\nThe message is to be taken up by those who love and fear God. Lay\nnot your burden upon any conference. Go forth, and, as evangelists,\nin a humble way present a \u201cThus saith the Scriptures.\u201d\u2014Letter 43,\n1905.\n24 Evangelism\nSection 2\u2014The Metropolitan Masses [25]\nIn the Shadow of Impending Doom\nMillions in the Cities Must Soon Decide\u2014The spiritual dark-\nness that covers the whole earth today, is intensified in the crowded\ncenters of population. It is in the cities of the nations that the gospel\nworker finds the greatest impenitence and the greatest need....\nThe record of crime and iniquity in the large cities of the land\nis appalling. The wickedness of the wicked is almost beyond com-\nprehension. Many cities are becoming a very Sodom in the sight\nof heaven. The increasing wickedness is such that multitudes are\nrapidly approaching a point in their personal experience beyond\nwhich it will be exceedingly difficult to reach them with a saving\nknowledge of the third angel\u2019s message. The enemy of souls is\nworking in a masterful manner to gain full control of the human\nmind; and what God\u2019s servants do to warn and prepare men for the\nday of judgment, must be done quickly.\nThe conditions that face Christian workers in the great cities,\nconstitute a solemn appeal for untiring effort in behalf of the millions\nliving within the shadow of impending doom. Men will soon be\nforced to great decisions, and they must have opportunity to hear\nand to understand Bible truth, in order that they may take their\nstand intelligently on the right side. God is now calling upon His\nmessengers in no uncertain terms, to warn the cities while mercy still[26]\nlingers, and while multitudes are yet susceptible to the converting\ninfluence of Bible truth.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 7, 1910.\nOn the \u201cMarch to Death\u201d \u2014Satan is busily at work in our\ncrowded cities. His work is to be seen in the confusion, the strife and\ndiscord between labor and capital, and the hypocrisy that has come\ninto the churches. That men may not take time to meditate, Satan\nleads them into a round of gayety and pleasure-seeking, of eating\nand drinking. He fills them with ambition to make an exhibition that\nwill exalt self. Step by step, the world is reaching the conditions that\nexisted in the days of Noah. Every conceivable crime is committed.\nThe lust of the flesh, the pride of the eyes, the display of selfishness,\n26\nIn the Shadow of Impending Doom 27\nthe misuse of power, the cruelty, and the force used to cause men\nto unite with confederacies and unions\u2014binding themselves up in\nbundles for the burning of the great fires of the last days\u2014all these\nare the working of Satanic agencies. This round of crime and folly\nmen call \u201clife.\u201d...\nThe world, who act as though there were no God, absorbed in\nselfish pursuits, will soon experience sudden destruction, and shall\nnot escape. Many continue in the careless gratification of self until\nthey become so disgusted with life that they kill themselves. Danc-\ning and carousing, drinking and smoking, indulging their animal\npassions, they go as an ox to the slaughter. Satan is working with all\nhis art and enchantments to keep men marching blindly onward until\nthe Lord arises out of His place to punish the inhabitants of earth\nfor their iniquities, when the earth shall disclose her blood and no\nmore cover her slain. The whole world appears to be in the march to\ndeath.\u2014Manuscript 139, 1903.\nAmbitious Devisings\u2014Men and women living in these cities [27]\nare rapidly becoming more and still more entangled in their business\nrelations. They are acting wildly in the erection of buildings whose\ntowers reach high into the heavens. Their minds are filled with\nschemes and ambitious devisings.\u2014Manuscript 154, 1902.\nIf Heaven\u2019s Warnings Go Unheeded\u2014I am bidden to declare\nthe message that cities full of transgression, and sinful in the extreme,\nwill be destroyed by earthquakes, by fire, by flood. All the world\nwill be warned that there is a God who will display His authority as\nGod. His unseen agencies will cause destruction, devastation, and\ndeath. All the accumulated riches will be as nothingness....\nCalamities will come\u2014calamities most awful, most unexpected;\nand these destructions will follow one after another. If there will be\na heeding of the warnings that God has given, and if churches will\nrepent, returning to their allegiance, then other cities may be spared\nfor a time. But if men who have been deceived continue in the same\nway in which they have been walking, disregarding the law of God\nand presenting falsehoods before the people, God allows them to\nsuffer calamity, that their senses may be awakened....\nThe Lord will not suddenly cast off all transgressors or destroy\nentire nations; but He will punish cities and places where men have\ngiven themselves up to the possession of Satanic agencies. Strictly\n28 Evangelism\nwill the cities of the nations be dealt with, and yet they will not be\nvisited in the extreme of God\u2019s indignation, because some souls will\nyet break away from the delusions of the enemy, and will repent and\nbe converted, while the mass will be treasuring up wrath against the\nday of wrath.\u2014Manuscript 35, 1906.\nTo Arouse the People\u2014While at Loma Linda, California, April[28]\n16, 1906, there passed before me a most wonderful representation.\nDuring a vision of the night, I stood on an eminence, from which I\ncould see houses shaken like a reed in the wind. Buildings, great and\nsmall, were falling to the ground. Pleasure resorts, theaters, hotels,\nand the homes of the wealthy were shaken and shattered. Many lives\nwere blotted out of existence, and the air was filled with the shrieks\nof the injured and the terrified.\nThe destroying angels of God were at work. One touch, and\nbuildings so thoroughly constructed that men regarded them as se-\ncure against every danger, quickly became heaps of rubbish. There\nwas no assurance of safety in any place. I did not feel in any special\nperil, but the awfulness of the scenes that passed before me I cannot\nfind words to describe. It seemed that the forbearance of God was\nexhausted, and that the judgment day had come.\nThe angel that stood by my side then instructed me that but few\nhave any conception of the wickedness existing in our world today,\nand especially the wickedness in the large cities. He declared that\nthe Lord has appointed a time when He will visit transgressors in\nwrath for persistent disregard of His law.\nTerrible as was the representation that passed before me, that\nwhich impressed itself most vividly upon my mind was the instruc-\ntion given in connection with it. The angel that stood by my side\ndeclared that God\u2019s supreme rulership, and the sacredness of His\nlaw, must be revealed to those who persistently refuse to render obe-\ndience to the King of kings. Those who choose to remain disloyal\nmust be visited in mercy with judgments, in order that, if possi-\nble, they may be aroused to a realization of the sinfulness of their\ncourse.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:92 (1909).\nA View of Great Destruction\u2014Last Friday morning, just be-[29]\nfore I awoke, a very impressive scene was presented before me. I\nseemed to awake from sleep but was not in my home. From the\nwindows I could behold a terrible conflagration. Great balls of fire\nIn the Shadow of Impending Doom 29\nwere falling upon houses, and from these balls fiery arrows were\nflying in every direction. It was impossible to check the fires that\nwere kindled, and many places were being destroyed. The terror\nof the people was indescribable. After a time I awoke and found\nmyself at home.\u2014Letter 278, 1906.\nBecause Large Cities Will Be Swept Away \u2014Everywhere\nthere are men who should be out in active ministry, giving the last\nmessage of warning to a fallen world. The work that should long\nago have been in active operation to win souls to Christ has not been\ndone. The inhabitants of the ungodly cities so soon to be visited by\ncalamities have been cruelly neglected. The time is near when large\ncities will be swept away, and all should be warned of these coming\njudgments. But who is giving to the accomplishment of this work\nthe wholehearted service that God requires? ...\nAt the present time there is not a thousandth part being done in\nworking the cities, that should be done, and that would be done if\nmen and women would do their whole duty.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1910.\nDestruction of Thousands of Cities\u2014O that God\u2019s people had\na sense of the impending destruction of thousands of cities, now\nalmost given to idolatry.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 10,\n1903.\nHasten the Work\u2014As I consider the conditions in the cities\nthat are so manifestly under the power of Satan, I ask myself the\nquestion, What will be the end of these things? The wickedness in\nmany cities is increasing. Crime and iniquity are at work on every\nhand. New species of idolatry are continually being introduced into [30]\nsociety. In every nation the minds of men are turning to the invention\nof some new thing. Rashness of deed and confusion of mind are\neverywhere increasing. Surely the cities of the earth are becoming\nlike Sodom and Gomorrah.\nAs a people we need to hasten the work in the cities, which\nhas been hindered for lack of workers and means and a spirit of\nconsecration. At this time, the people of God need to turn their\nhearts fully to Him; for the end of all things is at hand. They need\nto humble their minds, and to be attentive to the will of the Lord,\nworking with earnest desire to do that which God has shown must\nbe done to warn the cities of their impending doom.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, January 25, 1912.\nIncreasing Difficulties\nAdvance With Increasing Effort \u2014We are nearing the great\nand final conflict. Every advance move made now must be made\nwith increasing effort; for Satan is working with all power to increase\nthe difficulties in our way. He works with all deceivableness of\nunrighteousness to secure the souls of men. I am charged to say\nto ministers of the gospel and to our missionary physicians, Go\nforward. The work to be done calls for self-sacrifice at every step,\nbut go forward.\u2014Letter 38, 1908.\nNo Time to Lose\u2014We have no time to lose. The end is near.\nThe passage from place to place to spread the truth will soon be\nhedged with dangers on the right hand and on the left. Everything\nwill be placed to obstruct the way of the Lord\u2019s messengers, so that\nthey will not be able to do that which it is possible for them to do[31]\nnow. We must look our work fairly in the face, and advance as fast\nas possible in aggressive warfare.\nFrom the light given me of God I know that the powers of dark-\nness are working with intense energy from beneath, and with stealthy\ntread Satan is advancing to take those who are now asleep, as a wolf\ntaking his prey. We have warnings now which we may give, a work\nnow which we may do; but soon it will be more difficult than we can\nimagine. God help us to keep in the channel of light, to work with\nour eyes fastened on Jesus our Leader, and patiently, perseveringly\npress on to gain the victory.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:22\n(1900).\nCity Evangelism Becoming More Difficult\u2014We do not realize\nthe extent to which Satanic agencies are at work in these large cities.\nThe work of bringing the message of present truth before the people\nis becoming more and more difficult. It is essential that new and\nvaried talents unite in intelligent labor for the people.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 300 (1909).\nFavorable Time for the Cities Passed By\u2014A great work is to\nbe done. I am moved by the Spirit of God to say to those engaged\n30\nIncreasing Difficulties 31\nin the Lord\u2019s work, that the favorable time for our message to be\ncarried to the cities has passed by, and this work has not been done. I\nfeel a heavy burden that we shall now redeem the time.\u2014Manuscript\n62, 1903.\nThe work which the church has failed to do in a time of peace\nand prosperity, she will have to do in a terrible crisis, under most dis-\ncouraging, forbidding circumstances.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n5:463 (1885).\nGod\u2019s Spirit Gradually Withdrawn\u2014The days in which we\nlive are solemn and important. The Spirit of God is gradually but\nsurely being withdrawn from the earth. Plagues and judgments [32]\nare already falling upon the despisers of the grace of God. The\ncalamities by land and sea, the unsettled state of society, the alarms\nof war, are portentous. They forecast approaching events of the\ngreatest magnitude.\nThe agencies of evil are combining their forces, and consolidat-\ning. They are strengthening for the last great crisis. Great changes\nare soon to take place in our world, and the final movements will be\nrapid ones.\u2014Testimonies, vol. 9, p 11. (1909).\nSpirit of War Stirring Nations\u2014Fearful tests and trials await\nthe people of God. The spirit of war is stirring the nations from one\nend of the earth to the other.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:17\n(1909).\nBefore Doors Now Open Shall Close\u2014Again and again I am\ninstructed to present to our churches the work that should be done in\nour large cities. There is a great work to be done, not only where we\nhave churches already established, but also in places where the truth\nhas never been fully presented. Right in our midst there are heathen\nas verily as in far-off lands. The way must be opened to reach these\nwith the truth for this time; and these openings should be made at\nonce....\nOften we have been told that our cities are to hear the message,\nbut how slow we are to heed the instruction. I saw One standing on\na high platform with arms extended. He turned and pointed in every\ndirection, saying, \u201cA world perishing in ignorance of God\u2019s holy law,\nand Seventh-day Adventists are asleep.\u201d The Lord is pleading for\nlaborers, for there is a great work to be done. There are conversions\n32 Evangelism\nto be made that will add to the church such as shall be saved. Men\nand women in the highways and byways are to be reached....\nWe are far behind in following the light God has given regarding[33]\nthe working of our large cities. The time is coming when laws will\nbe framed that will close doors now open to the message. We need\nto arouse to earnest effort now, while the angels of God are waiting\nto give their wonderful aid to all who will labor to arouse the con-\nsciences of men and women regarding righteousness, temperance,\nand judgment to come.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1908.\nWork While You Can\u2014My brethren, enter the cities while you\ncan. In the cities that have been already entered there are many\nwho have never heard the message of truth. Some who have heard\nhave been converted, and some have died in the faith. There are\nmany others who, if they were given an opportunity, might hear and\naccept the message of salvation.... These, our last efforts for the\nwork of God in the earth, must bear decidedly the impress of the\ndivine.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1908.\nThe Call for a Speedy Work\nTime Is Short\u2014The message that I am bidden to bear to our\npeople at this time is, Work the cities without delay, for time is short.\nThe Lord has kept this work before us for the last twenty years or\nmore. A little has been done in a few places, but much more might\nbe done.\u2014Letter 168, 1909.\nWhere Is Your Faith?\u2014When I think of the many cities yet\nunwarned, I cannot rest. It is distressing to think that they have\nbeen neglected so long. For many, many years the cities of America,\nincluding the cities in the South, have been set before our people\nas places needing special attention. A few have borne the burden\nof working in these cities; but, in comparison with the great needs [34]\nand the many opportunities, but little has been done. Where is your\nfaith, my brethren? Where are the workmen? ...\nShall we not plan to send messengers all through these fields,\nand support them liberally? Shall not the ministers of God go into\nthese crowded centers, and there lift up their voices in warning to\nmultitudes? At such a time as this, every hand is to be employed.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, November 25, 1909.\nMultitudes Unwarned\u2014In New York, [See also pp. 384-406,\n\u201cThe Work in the Large American Cities.\u201d] and in many other cities,\nthere are multitudes of people unwarned.... We must set about this\nwork in earnestness, and do it. Laying aside our peculiarities, and\nour own ideas, we are to preach Bible truth. Men of consecration and\ntalent are to be sent into these cities and set to work.\u2014Manuscript\n25, 1910.\nTime to Wake Up the Watchmen \u2014Our cities are to be\nworked.... Money is needed for the prosecution of the work in\nNew York, Boston, Portland, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Chicago, St.\nLouis, New Orleans, and many other cities. In some of these places\nthe people were mightily stirred by the message given in 1842 to\n1844, but of late years little has been done compared to the great\n33\n34 Evangelism\nwork that ought to be in progress. And it seems difficult to make our\npeople feel a special burden for the work in the large cities.\nI appeal to our brethren who have heard the message for many\nyears. It is time to wake up the watchmen. I have expended my\nstrength in giving the messages the Lord has given me. The burden\nof the needs of our cities has rested so heavily upon me that it has\nsometimes seemed that I should die. May the Lord give wisdom to\nour brethren, that they may know how to carry forward the work in[35]\nharmony with the will of the Lord.\u2014Manuscript 13, 1910.\nMillions to Hear the Message \u2014The cities must be worked.\nThe millions living in these congested centers are to hear the third\nangel\u2019s message. This work should have been developed rapidly\nduring the past few years.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 5, 1906.\nSpecial Opportunities for Evangelism\nAt Large Gatherings Like St. Louis Fair \u2014I was given in-\nstruction that as we approach the end, there will be large gatherings\nin our cities, as there has recently been in St. Louis, and that prepa-\nrations must be made to present the truth at these gatherings. When\nChrist was upon this earth, He took advantage of such opportunities.\nWherever a large number of people was gathered for any purpose,\nHis voice was heard, clear and distinct, giving His message. And\nas a result, after His crucifixion and ascension, thousands were con-\nverted in a day. The seed sown by Christ sank deep into hearts, and\ngerminated, and when the disciples received the gift of the Holy\nSpirit, the harvest was gathered in.\nThe disciples went forth and preached the word everywhere with\nsuch power that fear fell upon their opposers, and they dared not do\nthat which they would have done had not the evidence been so plain\nthat God was working.\nAt every large gathering some of our ministers should be in\nattendance. They should work wisely to obtain a hearing and to get\nthe light of the truth before as many as possible....\nWe should improve every such opportunity as that presented by [36]\nthe St. Louis Fair. At all such gatherings there should be present\nmen whom God can use. Leaflets containing the light of present\ntruth should be scattered among the people like the leaves of autumn.\nTo many who attend these gatherings these leaflets would be as the\nleaves of the tree of life, which are for the healing of the nations.\nI send you this, my brethren, that you may give it to others.\nThose who go forth to proclaim the truth shall be blessed by Him\nwho has given them the burden of proclaiming this truth....\nThe time has come when, as never before, Seventh-day Adven-\ntists are to arise and shine, because their light has come, and the\nglory of the Lord has risen upon them.\u2014Letter 296, 1904.\n35\nSurveying the Needs of the Large Cities\nCity Work Is Difficult\u2014We feel intensely regarding the work\nin our cities. There are few ready to engage in the work waiting to\nbe done. There are people of all classes to be met; and the work is\ndifficult. But we shall encourage all who have tact and the ability to\nunderstand the situation to give themselves to the work of sounding\nthe last note of warning to the world.\u2014Letter 82, 1910.\nThe Need of Study and Means\u2014A few faithful workers have\nbeen trying to do something in this great, wicked city [New York].\n[See also pp. 384-389, \u201cNew York.\u201d] But their work has been diffi-\ncult, because they have had so few facilities. Elder ----- and his wife\nhave labored faithfully. But who has felt the burden of sustaining[37]\nthem in their labors? Who among our leading men have visited\nthem, to learn the needs of the work?\u2014The General Conference\nBulletin, April 7, 1903.\nDifficulties and Fears the Cause of Neglect\u2014Time is rapidly\npassing into eternity, and these cities have as yet scarcely been\ntouched. There is a power that the Spirit of God can impart to truth.\nAs light is flashed into the mind, a conviction will take hold of hearts\nthat will be too powerful to resist....\nMy duty is to say that God is earnestly calling for a great work\nto be done in the cities. New fields are to be opened. Men who know\nthe message and who should feel the responsibilities of the work\nhave manifested so little faith that because of difficulties or fears\nthere has been a long neglect.\u2014Letter 150, 1909.\nCommission to Study Special Needs\u2014Seven men should have\nbeen chosen to be united with the president, to set in operation a\nwork in the great cities for those who are perishing without the truth,\nwhile no determined efforts are being put forth to save them. These\nseven men should be men who are wide awake, men that are humble\nand meek and lowly in heart. Never should the cities have been\nneglected as they are; for there has come most decidedly message\nafter message calling for earnest labor.\n36\nSurveying the Needs of the Large Cities 37\nNo less than seven men should be chosen to carry the large\nresponsibilities of the work of God in the great cities. And these men\nshould humble themselves daily and seek the Lord most earnestly\nfor sanctified wisdom. They should relate themselves to God as men\ndesirous to be taught. They must be men of prayer, who realize the\nperil of their own souls. What should be the work of these seven\nmen? They should investigate the needs of the cities and put forth\nearnest, decided efforts to advance the work.\u2014Letter 58, 1910. [38]\nTo See the Needs as God Sees Them\u2014The Lord desires us to\nproclaim the third angel\u2019s message with power in these cities.... As\nwe work with all the strength that God grants us, and in humility of\nheart, putting our entire trust in Him, our labors will not be without\nfruit. Our determined efforts to bring souls to a knowledge of the\ntruth for this time will be seconded by holy angels, and many souls\nwill be saved. The Lord never forsakes His faithful messengers. He\nsends to their aid heavenly agencies and accompanies their labors\nwith the power of His Holy Spirit to convince and to convert. All\nheaven will endorse your appeals.\nO that we might see the needs of these great cities as God sees\nthem! We must plan to place in these cities capable men who can\npresent the third angel\u2019s message in a manner so forceful that it\nwill strike home to the heart. Men who can do this, we cannot\nafford to gather into one place, to do a work that others might do.\u2014\nManuscript 53, 1909.\nProblems Peculiar to Metropolitan Evangelism\nLarge and Best Halls\u2014It has been a difficult problem to know\nhow to reach the people in the great centers of population. We are\nnot allowed entrance to the churches. In the cities the large halls are\nexpensive, and in most cases but few will come out to the best halls.\nWe have been spoken against by those who were not acquainted\nwith us. The reasons of our faith are not understood by the people,\nand we have been regarded as fanatics, who were ignorantly keeping[39]\nSaturday for Sunday. In our work we have been perplexed to know\nhow to break through the barriers of worldliness and prejudice, and\nbring before the people the precious truth which means so much to\nthem.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:31, 32 (1900).\nThe Practical Problem of Finding a Hall \u2014The difficulties\nmentioned are the ones to be met in almost every place, but not in so\nmanifest a form as in -----. We think Satan has made his seat in that\nplace, to work out his deeds, that the laborers shall be discouraged\nand give it up....\nWe must seek wisdom of God, for by faith I see a strong church\nin that city. Our work must be to watch and to pray, to seek counsel\nof the One wonderful and mighty in counsel. One mightier than the\nstrongest powers of hell can take the prey from Satan, and under His\nguidance the angels of heaven will carry on the battle against all the\npowers of darkness and plant the standard of truth and righteousness\nin that city....\nOur brethren have been searching for a place to hold meetings\nin. The theaters and halls present so many objectionable phases that\nwe think we shall use the skating rink, which has lately been used\nfor religious and temperance meetings.... If we get a place to hold\nforth the word of life, it will cost money. God will make a place\nfor His own truth to come to the people, for this is the way He has\nwrought.\u2014Letter 79, 1893.\nSecuring City Evangelists \u2014Now, when the Lord bids us to\nproclaim the message once more with power in the East, when\n38\nProblems Peculiar to Metropolitan Evangelism 39\nHe bids us enter the cities of the East and of the South and of the\nNorth and of the West, shall we not respond as one man and do His\nbidding? Shall we not plan to send messengers all through these\nfields and support them liberally? ... All our cities are to be worked. [40]\nThe Lord is coming. The end is near; yea, it hasteth greatly! In a\nlittle while from this we shall be unable to work with the freedom\nthat we now enjoy. Terrible scenes are before us, and what we do\nwe must do quickly. We must now build up the work in every place\npossible. And for the accomplishment of this work we greatly need\nin the field the help that can be given by our ministers of experience\nwho are able to hold the attention of large congregations....\nThe Lord desires us to proclaim the third angel\u2019s message with\npower in these cities. We cannot exercise this power ourselves. All\nwe can do is to choose men of capability and urge them to go into\nthese avenues of opportunity and there proclaim the message in the\npower of the Holy Spirit. As they talk the truth and live the truth and\npray the truth, God will move upon hearts.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1909.\n\u201cHighway\u201d Evangelists\u2014Elder -----\u2019s ability as a speaker is\nneeded in presenting the truth in the highways. When the truth\nis presented in the highways, the hedges will be opened and an\nextended work will be done.\u2014Letter 168, 1909.\nExtraordinary Efforts Demanded \u2014In the cities of today,\nwhere there is so much to attract and please, the people can be\ninterested by no ordinary efforts. Ministers of God\u2019s appointment\nwill find it necessary to put forth extraordinary efforts in order to\narrest the attention of the multitudes. And when they succeed in\nbringing together a large number of people, they must bear mes-\nsages of a character so out of the usual order that the people will\nbe aroused and warned. They must make use of every means that\ncan possibly be devised for causing the truth to stand out clearly and\ndistinctly. The testing message for this time is to be borne so plainly [41]\nand decidedly as to startle the hearers and lead them to desire to\nstudy the Scriptures.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:109 (1909).\nOpposition, Expense, and Changing Audiences \u2014I dreamed\nthat several of our brethren were in council, considering plans of\nlabor for this season [1874]. They thought it best not to enter the\nlarge cities, but to begin work in small places, remote from the cities;\nhere they would meet less opposition from the clergy, and would\n40 Evangelism\navoid great expense. They reasoned that our ministers, being few\nin number, could not be spared to instruct and care for those who\nmight accept the truth in the cities, and who, because of the greater\nopposition they would there meet, would need more help than would\nthe churches in small country places. Thus the fruit of giving a\ncourse of lectures in the city would, in a great measure, be lost.\nAgain, it was urged that, because of our limited means, and because\nof the many changes from moving that might be expected from a\nchurch in a large city, it would be difficult to build up a church\nthat would be a strength to the cause. My husband was urging\nthe brethren to make broader plans without delay, and put forth,\nin our large cities, extended and thorough effort, that would better\ncorrespond to the character of our message. One worker related\nincidents of his experience in the cities, showing that the work was\nnearly a failure, but he testified to better success in the small places.\nOne of dignity and authority\u2014One who is present in all our coun-\ncil meetings\u2014was listening with deepest interest to every word. He\nspoke with deliberation and perfect assurance. \u201cThe whole world,\u201d\nHe said, \u201cis God\u2019s great vineyard. The cities and villages constitute\na part of that vineyard. These must be worked.\u201d\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 7:34, 35 (1902).\nAn Expensive Work\u2014It almost seems as if scarcely anyone[42]\ndares ask a worker to go into the cities, because of the means that\nwould be required to carry on a strong, solid work. It is true that\nmuch means will be required in order to do our duty toward the\nunwarned in these places; and God desires us to lift our voices and\nour influence in favor of using means wisely in this special line of\neffort.\u2014Manuscript 45, 1910.\nHearty Co-operation Imperative \u2014In our large cities a de-\ncided effort should be made to work in unity. In the spirit and\nfear of God the laborers should unite as one man, working with\nstrength and with earnest zeal. There should be no sensational ef-\nforts, no strife. Let there be seen practical repentance, true sympathy,\nhearty co-operation, and decided emulation of one another in the\ngrand, earnest effort to learn lessons of self-denial and self-sacrifice\nby saving perishing souls from death.\u2014Manuscript 128, 1901.\nLet us thank the Lord that there are a few laborers doing every-\nthing possible to raise up some memorials for God in our neglected\nProblems Peculiar to Metropolitan Evangelism 41\ncities. Let us remember that it is our duty to give these workers\nencouragement. God is displeased with the lack of appreciation and\nsupport shown our faithful workers in our large cities.\u2014Manuscript\n154, 1902.\nHolding to the Work for a Fully Developed Conclusion\u2014In\nefforts made in large cities one half of the labor is lost because they\n[the laborers] close up the work too soon and go to a new field. Paul\nlabored long in his fields, continuing his work for one year in one\nplace and one year and a half in another place. The haste to close up\nan effort has frequently resulted in a great loss.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nThe Promise of an Abundant Harvest[43]\nAn Impressive Scene\u2014In the visions of the night a very im-\npressive scene passed before me. I saw an immense ball of fire fall\namong some beautiful mansions, causing their instant destruction.\nI heard someone say, \u201cWe knew that the judgments of God were\ncoming upon the earth, but we did not know that they would come\nso soon.\u201d Others, with agonized voices, said, \u201cYou knew!\u201d Why then\ndid you not tell us? We did not know.\u201d On every side I heard similar\nwords of reproach spoken.\nIn great distress I awoke. I went to sleep again, and I seemed\nto be in a large gathering. One of authority was addressing the\ncompany, before whom was spread out a map of the world. He said\nthat the map pictured God\u2019s vineyard, which must be cultivated. As\nlight from heaven shone upon any one, that one was to reflect the\nlight to others. Lights were to be kindled in many places, and from\nthese lights still other lights were to be kindled....\nI saw jets of light shining from cities and villages, and from\nthe high places and the low places of the earth. God\u2019s word was\nobeyed, and as a result there were memorials for Him in every\ncity and village. His truth was proclaimed throughout the world.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 9:28, 29 (1909).\nSolemn Warnings Stir Thousands\u2014Men of faith and prayer\nwill be constrained to go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words\nwhich God gives them. The sins of Babylon will be laid open.\nThe fearful results of enforcing the observances of the church by\ncivil authority, the inroads of Spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid\nprogress of the papal power,\u2014all will be unmasked. By these solemn\nwarnings the people will be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will[44]\nlisten who have never heard words like these. In amazement they\nhear the testimony that Babylon is the church, fallen because of her\nerrors and sins, because of her rejection of the truth sent to her from\nheaven.\u2014The Great Controversy, 606, 607 (1888).\n42\nPromise of an Abundant Harvest 43\nMany to Come to the Light \u2014Through the grace of Christ,\nGod\u2019s ministers are made messengers of light and blessing. As\nby earnest, persevering prayer they obtain the endowment of the\nHoly Spirit and go forth weighted with the burden of soulsaving,\ntheir hearts filled with zeal to extend the triumphs of the cross,\nthey will see fruit of their labors. Resolutely refusing to display\nhuman wisdom or to exalt self, they will accomplish a work that\nwill withstand the assaults of Satan. Many souls will be turned from\ndarkness to light, and many churches will be established. Men will\nbe converted, not to the human instrumentality, but to Christ.\u2014The\nActs of the Apostles, 278 (1911).\n44 Evangelism\nSection 3\u2014Smaller Communities and [45]\nRural Areas\nThe Highways and Byways\nOut-of-the-Way Places\u2014In our planning for the extension of\nthe work, far more than the cities alone must be comprehended.\nIn out-of-the-way places are many, many families that need to be\nlooked after in order to learn whether they understand the work that\nJesus is doing for His people.\nThose in the highways are not to be neglected; neither are those\nin the hedges; and as we journey about from place to place and pass\nby house after house, we should often inquire, \u201cHave the people\nwho are living in these places heard the message? Has the truth of\nGod\u2019s Word been brought to their ears? Do they understand that\nthe end of all things is at hand, and that the judgments of God are\nimpending? Do they realize that every soul has been bought with an\ninfinite price? As I meditate upon these things, my heart goes out in\ndeep longing to see the truth carried in its simplicity to the homes\nof these people along the highways and places far removed from\nthe crowded centers of population....It is our privilege to visit them\nand acquaint them with God\u2019s love for them and with His wonderful\nprovision for the salvation of their souls.\nIn this work in the highways and the hedges, there are serious\ndifficulties to be met and overcome. The worker, as he searches for\nsouls, is not to fear nor be discouraged, for God is his helper, and[46]\nwill continue to be his helper; and He will open up ways before His\nservants.\u2014Manuscript 15, 1909.\nA Call for Larger Plans\u2014We are altogether too narrow in our\nplans. We need to be broader minded. God wants us to carry out\nin our work for Him the principles of truth and righteousness. His\nwork is to go forward in cities and towns and villages....\nWe must get away from our smallness and make larger plans.\nThere must be a wider reaching forth to work for those who are nigh\nand those who are afar off.\u2014Manuscript 87, 1907.\nUnpromising Fields\u2014The field of labor is to be extended. The\ngospel message is to go to all parts of the world. The most unpromis-\n46\nHighways and Byways 47\ning fields must receive earnest, determined labor. The sons of God,\nearnest, true, unselfish, must use all the knowledge they possess in\nmanaging this important work.\u2014Manuscript 141, 1899.\nCountry People More Easily Reached\u2014The people who live\nin the country places are often more easily reached than are those\nwho dwell in the thickly populated cities. Here among the scenes\nof nature Christian character is more easily formed than amid the\nwickedness of city life. When the truth takes hold of the hearts of\nthe simplehearted, and the Spirit of God works upon their minds,\nleading them to respond to the proclamation of the Word, there will\nbe some raised up to help support the cause of God both by their\nmeans and their labors.\u2014Manuscript 65, 1908.\nTo All Classes\u2014Men and women in the highways and byways\nare to be reached. We read of Christ\u2019s labors: \u201cJesus went about all\nthe cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching\nthe gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every [47]\ndisease among the people.\u201d Just such a work as this is to be done in\nour cities and villages, in the highways and hedges. The gospel of\nthe third angel\u2019s message is to be carried to all classes.\u2014Manuscript\n7, 1908.\nSounding the Call in New Places\u2014Our Saviour\u2019s work was to\nwarn the cities and to ordain workers to go out of the cities to places\nwhere the light had never yet been given, and to lift up the standard\nof truth in new localities....The light is given me that we must not\nhave special anxiety to crowd too many interests into one locality,\nbut should look for places in out-of-the-way districts and work in\nnew places. Thus people may be reached and converted who know\nnothing of the precious, testing truths for this time. The last call\nshould be made just as important in new places in this country as in\ndistant lands. This word was spoken concerning some localities that\nhave not had the message brought to them. The seeds of truth are to\nbe sown in uncultivated centers....It will cultivate a missionary spirit\nto work in new localities. Selfishness in respect to keeping large\ncompanies together is not the Lord\u2019s plan. Enter every new place\npossible and begin the work of educating in vicinities that have not\nheard the truth.\nWhy did our Saviour labor to sow the seed in out-of-the-way\nplaces? Why did He travel slowly away from the villages which had\n48 Evangelism\nbeen His places for communicating light by opening the Scriptures?\nThere was a world to hear, and some souls would accept the truth\nwho had not yet heard it. Christ traveled slowly and opened the\nScriptures in their simplicity to minds that would receive the truth.\u2014\nLetter 318, 1908.\nSimultaneous Efforts in Smaller Cities \u2014During the time\nwhen camp meetings can be held in this conference, two or three[48]\nmeetings in different places should be in progress at the same time.\nThere is a time when these meetings cannot be held; but during\nthe months when we can use the tents to advantage, we are not to\nconfine our efforts to the largest cities. We must give the warning\nmessage to the people in every place.\u2014Manuscript 104, 1902.\nRural Workers\n[Note.\u2014While full recognition is given to the indispensable aid\nof laymen in all evangelistic activity (see pp. 110-115), it is clear\nthat the inhabitants of the rural areas will hear the warning message\nonly as regular workers and laymen unite in heralding the gospel.\nThus in this volume devoted solely to counsel to the evangelistic\nworker, in presenting the picture of evangelism in the rural areas,\nstatements appear calling the laymen to the work in the less densely\npopulated areas.\u2014Compilers.]\nBeginners enter unworked fields\u2014We are nearing the close of\nthis earth\u2019s history. We have before us a great work,\u2014the closing\nwork of giving the last warning message to a sinful world. There\nare men who will be taken from the plow, from the vineyard, from\nvarious other branches of work, and sent forth by the Lord to give\nthis message to the world.\nThe world is out of joint. As we look at the picture, the outlook\nseems discouraging. But Christ greets with hopeful assurance the\nvery men and women who cause us discouragement. In them He sees\nqualifications that will enable them to take a place in His vineyard.\nIf they will constantly be learners, through His providence He will\nmake them men and women fitted to do a work that is not beyond\ntheir capabilities; through the impartation of the Holy Spirit, He will\ngive them power of utterance.\nMany of the barren, unworked fields must be entered by begin-\nners. The brightness of the Saviour\u2019s view of the world will inspire\nconfidence in many workers, who, if they begin in humility, and [49]\nput their hearts into the work, will be found to be the right men for\nthe time and place. Christ sees all the misery and despair of the\nworld, the sight of which would bow down some of our workers of\nlarge capabilities with a weight of discouragement so great that they\nwould not know how even to begin the work of leading men and\nwomen to the first round of the ladder. Their precise methods are of\nlittle value. They would stand above the lower rounds of the ladder,\n49\n50 Evangelism\nsaying, \u201cCome up where we are.\u201d But the poor souls do not know\nwhere to put their feet.\nChrist\u2019s heart is cheered by the sight of those who are poor in\nevery sense of the term; cheered by His view of the ill-used ones\nwho are meek; cheered by the seemingly unsatisfied hungering after\nrighteousness, by the inability of many to begin. He welcomes, as\nit were, the very condition of things that would discourage many\nministers. He corrects our erring piety, giving the burden of the work\nfor the poor and needy in the rough places of the earth, to men and\nwomen who have hearts that can feel for the ignorant and for those\nthat are out of the way. The Lord teaches these workers how to meet\nthose whom He wishes them to help. They will be encouraged as\nthey see doors opening for them to enter places where they can do\nmedical missionary work. Having little self-confidence, they give\nGod all the glory....\nThe common people are to take their place as workers. Sharing\nthe sorrows of their fellow men as the Saviour shared the sorrows\nof humanity, they will by faith see Him working with them.\u2014Testi-\nmonies For The Church 7:270-272 (1902).\nYoung Workers for Hard Places\u2014The young men and women\nwho give themselves to the work of teaching the truth and laboring[50]\nfor the conversion of souls should first be vitalized by the Holy\nSpirit, and then they should go forth without the camp into the\nmost unpromising places. The Lord has not given to those of little\nexperience the work of preaching to the churches. The message is\nto be proclaimed in the highways and hedges.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1901.\nMarried Men and Women in Neglected Fields\u2014Let married\nmen and women who know the truth go forth to the neglected fields\nto enlighten others. Follow the example of those who have done\npioneer work in new fields. Wisely work in places where you can\nbest labor. Learn the principles of health reform, in order that you\nmay be able to teach them to others. By reading and studying the\nvarious books and periodicals on the subject of health, learn to give\ntreatment to the sick, and thus to do better work for the Master.\u2014\nLetter 136, 1902.\nCarried by Those From Large Centers\u2014Those of our people\nwho are living in large centers would gain a precious experience\nif, with their Bibles in their hands, and their hearts open to the\nRural Workers 51\nimpressions of the Holy Spirit, they would go forth to the highways\nand byways of the world with the message they have received.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, August 2, 1906.\nIn the Mountains and Valleys \u2014While I was in Lakeport\n[Northern California] I was deeply impressed with the fact that\nhere was a place where a faithful work should be done in giving the\nmessage of truth to the people. In this mountain region are many\nsouls who need the truths of the third angel\u2019s message. Under the\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit we are to proclaim the truth for this time\namong these settlements in the mountains and valleys. Its solemn\nwarnings are to be echoed and re-echoed. And the message must\ncome to the people quickly; it must be given line upon line, precept [51]\nupon precept, here a little and there a little. Without delay wise and\nintelligent men and women should engage in the work of sowing the\ngospel seed....\nThe Lord will work through those who will open the Scriptures\nto the people who have made their homes in these retired places of\nthe country. I appeal to my brethren and sisters to unite in doing this\ngood work, and carry it to completion....\nThe reason why I call your attention to Lakeport and its sur-\nrounding settlements is that these places have not yet received a\nright impression regarding the truth for this time. It may be that\namong our people there are those who will consent to use their\nmeans for the opening of missionary fields. To such I would say,\nFor the Master\u2019s sake, do what you can to help. We have not yet\ninvestigated fully how large a field for labor lies here, but Lakeport\nis one of the places presented to me as in need of our attention.\nI have much to say in regard to these settlements in the moun-\ntains. These are like settlements near Washington, where a similar\nwork should be done. Will not our people work more faithfully in\nthe highways and hedges? Commercial enterprises have so long\nabsorbed the interest and capabilities of so many Seventh-day Ad-\nventist that they are largely unfitted to do the work of bringing the\nlight of present truth before those who are ignorant of it. We should\nnot be content to permit such a condition to continue.\nThere are many of our people who, if they would go out of the\ncities and begin to labor in these byways, and also highways, would\nrecover physical health. I urge our brethren to go out as missionaries,\n52 Evangelism\ntwo and two, to these country places. Go in humility. Christ has\ngiven an example, and the Lord will certainly bless the efforts of[52]\nthose who will move out in the fear of God, bearing the message the\nSaviour gave to the first disciples, \u201cThe kingdom of God is come\nnigh unto you.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 65, 1908.\nMissionary Families for Towns and Villages\u2014Brethren who\nwish to change their location, who have the glory of God in view,\nand feel that individual responsibility rests upon them to do others\ngood, to benefit and save souls for whom Christ withheld not His\nprecious life, should move into towns and villages where there is\nlittle or no light and where they can be of real service and bless\nothers with their labor and experience. Missionaries are wanted to\ngo into towns and villages, and raise the standard of truth, that God\nmay have His witnesses scattered all over the land, that the light of\ntruth may penetrate where it has not yet reached, and the standard of\ntruth be raised where it is not yet known....\nJesus did not neglect the villages. The record declares that \u201cHe\nwent throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the\nglad tidings of the kingdom of God\u201d....\nNow is it not the duty of some who are standing idle here (Battle\nCreek), to go where they can represent Christ and His precious\ntruth?\u2014The General Conference Daily Bulletin, March 20, 1891.\nSection 4\u2014Planning for the Public [53]\nCampaign\nPatterning After the Master Evangelist\nStudy Christ\u2019s Methods\u2014If ever it has been essential that we\nunderstand and follow right methods of teaching and follow the\nexample of Christ, it is now.\u2014Letter 322, 1908.\nHow He Met the People \u2014If you would approach the people\nacceptably, humble your hearts before God, and learn His ways. We\nshall gain much instruction for our work from a study of Christ\u2019s\nmethods of labor and His manner of meeting the people. In the\ngospel story we have the record of how He worked for all classes,\nand of how as He labored in cities and towns, thousands were drawn\nto His side to hear His teaching. The words of the Master were\nclear and distinct, and were spoken in sympathy and tenderness.\nThey carried with them the assurance that here was truth. It was the\nsimplicity and earnestness with which Christ labored and spoke that\ndrew so many to Him.\nThe great Teacher laid plans for His work. Study these plans.\nWe find Him traveling from place to place, followed by crowds of\neager listeners. When He could, He would lead them away from the\ncrowded cities, to the quiet of the country. Here he would pray with[54]\nthem, and talk to them of eternal truths.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJanuary 18, 1912.\nIn the Synagogues\u2014By the Seaside \u2014Christ \u201cwent about all\nGalilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of\nthe kingdom and healing all manner of sickness.\u201d He preached in\nthe synagogues because thus He could reach the many who gathered\nthere. Then He went out and taught by the seaside and in the great\nthoroughfares of travel. The precious truths that He had to proclaim\nwere not to be confined to synagogues....\nChrist might have occupied the highest place among the highest\nteachers of the Jewish nation. But He chose rather to take the gospel\nto the poor. He went from place to place, that those in the highways\nand byways might catch the words of the gospel of truth. He labored\nin the way in which He desires His workers to labor today. By\n54\nPatterning After the Master Evangelist 55\nthe sea, on the mountainside, in the streets of the city, His voice\nwas heard explaining the Old Testament Scriptures. So unlike the\nexplanations of the scribes and Pharisees was His explanation that\nthe attention of the people was arrested. He taught as one having\nauthority, and not as the scribes. With clearness and power He\nproclaimed the gospel message.\u2014Letter 129, 1903.\nMethods Peculiarly His Own \u2014He attended the great yearly\nfestivals of the nation, and to the multitude absorbed in outward\nceremony He spoke of heavenly things, bringing eternity within\ntheir view. To all He brought treasures from the storehouse of\nwisdom. He spoke to them in language so simple that they could not\nfail of understanding. By methods peculiarly His own, He helped\nall who were in sorrow and affliction. With tender, courteous grace,\nHe ministered to the sin-sick soul, bringing healing and strength. [55]\nThe Prince of teachers, He sought access to the people by the\npathway of their most familiar associations. He presented the truth\nin such a way that ever after it was to His hearers intertwined with\ntheir most hallowed recollections and sympathies. He taught in\na way that made them feel the completeness of His identification\nwith their interests and happiness. His instruction was so direct,\nHis illustrations were so appropriate, His words so sympathetic\nand cheerful, that His hearers were charmed. The simplicity and\nearnestness with which He addressed the needy, hallowed every\nword.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 22-24 (1905).\nJesus Studied Faces\u2014Even the crowd that so often thronged\nHis steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate mass of human beings.\nHe spoke directly to every mind and appealed to every heart. He\nwatched the faces of His hearers, marked the lighting up of the\ncountenance, the quick, responsive glance, which told that truth had\nreached the soul; and there vibrated in His heart the answering chord\nof sympathetic joy.\u2014Education, 231 (1903).\nAppeal of Fallen Humanity\u2014In every human being, however\nfallen, He beheld a son of God, one who might be restored to the\nprivilege of His divine relationship.\u2014Education, 79 (1903).\nSimplicity, Directness, Repetition\u2014Christ\u2019s teaching was sim-\nplicity itself. He taught as one having authority. The Jews looked\nfor and claimed that the first advent of Christ should be with all\nthe representations of glory which should attend His second advent.\n56 Evangelism\nThe great Teacher proclaimed the truth to humanity, many of whom\ncould not be educated in the schools of the rabbis, neither in Greek [56]\nphilosophy. Jesus uttered truth in a plain, direct manner, giving vital\nforce and impressiveness to all His utterances. Had He raised His\nvoice to an unnatural key, as is customary with many preachers in\nthis day, the pathos and melody of the human voice would have been\nlost, and much of the force of the truth destroyed....\nIn His discourses Christ did not bring many things before them at\nonce, lest He might confuse their minds. He made every point clear\nand distinct. He did not disdain the repetition of old and familiar\ntruths in prophecies if they would serve His purpose to inculcate\nideas.\u2014Manuscript 25, 1890.\nHe Charmed the Greatest Minds\u2014Although the great truths\nuttered by our Lord were given in simple language, they were clothed\nwith such beauty that they interested and charmed the greatest intel-\nlects....\nTo give a true representation of the tender, loving, pitying care\nexercised by His Father, Jesus gave the parable of the prodigal\nson. Though His children err and stray from Him, if they repent\nand return, He will receive them with the joy manifested by an\nearthly father in receiving a long-lost son who in penitence returns.\u2014\nManuscript 132, 1902.\nThe Children Understood\u2014Christ\u2019s way of presenting truth\ncannot be improved upon.... The words of life were presented in\nsuch simplicity that a child could understand them. Men, women,\nand children were so impressed with His manner of explaining the\nScriptures that they would catch the very intonation of His voice,\nplace the same emphasis on their words, and imitate His gestures.\nYouth caught His spirit of ministry, and sought to pattern after His\ngracious ways by seeking to assist those whom they saw needing\nhelp.\u2014Counsels on Health, 498, 499 (1914).\nHe Reset Gems in the Framework of Truth\u2014In His teachings[57]\nChrist did not sermonize as ministers do today. His work was to\nbuild upon the framework of truth. He gathered up the precious gems\nof truth which had been appropriated by the enemy and placed in the\nframework of error, and reset them in the framework of truth, that\nall who received the word might be enriched thereby.\u2014Manuscript\n104, 1898.\nPatterning After the Master Evangelist 57\nHe Reinforced the Message\u2014Christ was always ready to an-\nswer the sincere inquirer after truth. When His disciples came to Him\nfor an explanation of some word He had spoken to the multitude,\nHe gladly repeated His lesson.\u2014Letter 164, 1902.\nHe Drew by Love \u2014Christ drew the hearts of His hearers to\nHim by the manifestation of His love, and then, little by little, as\nthey were able to bear it, He unfolded to them the great truths of the\nkingdom. We also must learn to adapt our labors to the condition of\nthe people\u2014to meet men where they are. While the claims of the\nlaw of God are to be presented to the world, we should never forget\nthat love, the love of Christ, is the only power that can soften the\nheart and lead to obedience.\u2014The Review and Herald, November\n25, 1890.\nHe Restrained Truth\u2014The great Teacher held in His hand the\nentire map of truth, but He did not disclose it all to His disciples.\nHe opened to them those subjects only which were essential to their\nadvancement in the path of heaven. There were many things in\nregard to which His wisdom kept Him silent.\nAs Christ withheld many things from His disciples, knowing\nthat then it would be impossible for them to comprehend, so today\nHe withholds many things from us, knowing the limited capacity of\nour understanding.\u2014Manuscript 118, 1902.\nIn Personal Interviews\u2014The work of Christ was largely com- [58]\nposed of personal interviews. He had a faithful regard for the one-\nsoul audience; and that one soul has carried to thousands the intelli-\ngence received.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 9, 1899.\nAt the Feasts \u2014When invited to a feast, Christ accepted the\ninvitation, that He might, while sitting at the table, sow the seeds\nof truth in the hearts of those present. He knew that the seed thus\nsown would spring up and bring forth fruit. He knew that some of\nthose sitting at meat with Him would afterward respond to His call,\n\u201cFollow Me.\u201d Ours is the privilege of studying Christ\u2019s manner of\nteaching as He went from place to place, everywhere sowing the\nseeds of truth.\u2014Manuscript 113, 1902.\nChrist\u2019s Follow-up Plan\u2014Christ sent out His disciples two and\ntwo, [See also pp. 72-74, \u201cTwo and Two.\u201d] to go to places to which\nHe would afterward follow.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1910.\n58 Evangelism\nWas Christ\u2019s Way Right?\u2014The Majesty of heaven journeyed\nfrom place to place on foot, teaching out of doors by the seaside,\nand in the mountain. Thus He drew the people to Him. Are we\ngreater than our Lord? Was His way the right way? Have we been\nworking unwisely in maintaining simplicity and godliness? We have\nnot learned our lesson yet as we should. Christ declares, Take My\nyoke of restraint and obedience upon you, and ye shall find rest unto\nyour souls. For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u2014Letter\n140, 1898.\nMolding and Correcting in Christ\u2019s Service \u2014The work of\nthe disciples needed molding and correcting by tenderest discipline,\nand by opening to others a knowledge of the word they themselves\nhad received; and Christ gave them special instruction in regard[59]\nto their course of action and their work. In His own life He had\ngiven them an example of strict conformity to the rules which He\nnow laid down for them. They were not to enter into controversies;\nthis was not their work. They were to reveal and advocate the\ntruth in their own characters, through earnest prayer and meditation\nrevealing personal experience in genuine Christianity. This would\nbe in decided contrast to the religion of the Pharisees and Sadducees.\nThey were to call the attention of their hearers to greater truths yet to\nbe revealed. They were to cast the arrow, and the Spirit of God was\nto guide the shaft into the heart.\u2014The Review and Herald, February\n1, 1898.\nPlanning an Expanding Evangelism\nThe Time for an Aggressive Work\u2014To all people and nations\nand kindreds and tongues the truth is to be proclaimed. The time\nhas come for much aggressive work to be done in the cities, and in\nall neglected, unworked fields.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 23,\n1904.\nWise Plans\u2014Diligent work is now called for. In this crisis, no\nhalfhearted efforts will prove successful. In all our city work, we\nare to hunt for souls. Wise plans are to be laid, in order that such\nwork may be done to the best possible advantage.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 27, 1906.\nLaunching Out Into the Deep\u2014There are those who think it\nis their duty to preach the truth, but they dare not venture from the\nshore, and they catch no fish. They will choose to go among the\nchurches, over and over the same ground. They report a good time,\na pleasant visit, but we look in vain for the souls that are converted [60]\nto the truth through their instrumentality. These ministers hug the\nshore too closely. Let them launch out into the deep, and cast their\nnet where the fish are. There is no lack of work to be done. There\ncould be hundreds employed in the vineyard of the Lord where there\nis now one.\u2014The True Missionary, February, 1874.\nA Challenge to the Leaders\u2014I ask those who have charge of\nour work: Why are so many places passed by? Look upon the towns\nand cities yet unworked. There are many large cities in America, not\nonly in the South, but in the North, yet to be worked. In every city\nin America there should be some memorial for God. But I could\nmention many places where the light of truth has not yet shone. The\nangels of heaven are waiting for human instrumentalities to enter the\nplaces where witness has not yet been borne to present truth.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, December 30, 1902.\nClear New Ground\u2014Establish New Centers\u2014Prepare work-\ners to go out in the highways and hedges. We need wise nurserymen\nwho will transplant trees to different localities and give them advan-\n59\n60 Evangelism\ntages, that they may grow. It is the positive duty of God\u2019s people to\ngo into the regions beyond. Let forces be set at work to clear new\nground, to establish new centers of influence wherever an opening\ncan be found.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1908.\nReach Beyond the Gospel-hardened Centers\u2014Let us remem-\nber that as a people entrusted with sacred truth, we have been ne-\nglectful and positively unfaithful. The work has been confined to a\nfew centers, until the people in them have become gospel hardened.\nIt is difficult to make an impression on those who have heard so\nmuch truth and yet have rejected it. In a few places too much has[61]\nbeen expended, while many, many cities have been left unwarned\nand unworked.\nAll this is against us now. Had we put forth earnest efforts to\nreach those who if converted would give a true representation of\nwhat present truth would do for human beings, how much further\nadvanced our work would now be. It is not right that a few places\nshould have all the advantages, while other places are neglected.\u2014\nLetter 132, 1902.\nPlanning Ahead for New Openings\u2014Oh, how I seem to hear\nthe voice day and night, \u201cGo forward; add new territory; enter new\nterritory with the tent, and give the last message of warning to the\nworld. There is no time to be lost. Leave My memorial in every\nplace where ye shall go. My Spirit will go before you, and the glory\nof the Lord shall be your rearward.\u201d\nThere are other towns not a long distance from here, which must\nhave a camp meeting next year. This is the very plan of God how\nthe work should be carried. Those who have had the light for years\nto enter new fields with the tent, and have held the camp meetings in\nthe same ground for years, need to be converted themselves, because\nthey do not heed the word of the Lord.\u2014Letter 174, 1900.\nMoving Forward by Faith\nAdvance in Faith\u2014Means Will Come \u2014Can we expect the\ninhabitants of these cities to come to us and say, \u201cIf you will come\nto us and preach, we will help you to do thus and so\u201d? They know\nnothing of our message. The Lord desires us to let our light so shine\nbefore men that His Holy Spirit may communicate the truth to the\nhonest in heart who are seeking after truth. As we do this work, we [62]\nshall find that means will flow into our treasuries, and we shall have\nmeans with which to carry on a still broader and more far-reaching\nwork.\nShall we not advance in faith, just as if we had thousands of\ndollars? We do not have half faith enough. Let us act our part in\nwarning these cities. The warning message must come to the people\nwho are ready to perish, unwarned, unsaved. How can we delay? As\nwe advance, the means will come. But we must advance by faith,\ntrusting in the Lord God of Israel.\nNight after night I am unable to sleep, because of this burden\nresting upon me in behalf of the unwarned cities. Night after night\nI am praying and trying to devise methods by which we can enter\nthese cities and give the warning message. Why, there is a world to\nbe warned and saved, and we are to go East and West and North and\nSouth, and work intelligently for the people all about us. As we un-\ndertake this work, we shall see the salvation of God. Encouragement\nwill come.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1909.\nFollow God\u2019s Opening Providence\u2014If we would follow the\nopening providence of God, we should be quick to discern every\nopening, and make the most of every advantage within our reach....\nThere is a fearfulness to venture out and run risks in this great work,\nfearing that the expenditure of means would not bring returns. What\nif means are used and yet we cannot see that souls have been saved\nby it? What if there is a dead loss of a portion of our means? Better\nwork and keep at work than to do nothing. You know not which\nshall prosper\u2014this or that.\n61\n62 Evangelism\nMen will invest in patent rights and meet with heavy losses, and\nit is taken as a matter of course. But in the work and cause of God,[63]\nmen are afraid to venture. Money seems to them to be a dead loss\nthat does not bring immediate returns when invested in the work of\nsaving souls. The very means that is now so sparingly invested in\nthe cause of God, and that is selfishly retained, will in a little while\nbe cast with all idols to the moles and to the bats. Money will soon\ndepreciate in value very suddenly when the reality of eternal scenes\nopens to the senses of man.\nGod will have men who will venture anything and everything to\nsave souls. Those who will not move until they can see every step\nof the way clearly before them will not be of advantage at this time\nto forward the truth of God. There must be workers now who will\npush ahead in the dark as well as in the light, and who will hold\nup bravely under discouragements and disappointed hopes, and yet\nwork on with faith, with tears and patient hope, sowing beside all\nwaters, trusting the Lord to bring the increase. God calls for men\nof nerve, of hope, faith, and endurance, to work to the point.\u2014The\nTrue Missionary, January, 1874.\nBe Resourceful\u2014In these perilous times we should leave un-\ntried no means of warning the people. We should be deeply inter-\nested in everything that will stay the tide of iniquity. Work on. Have\nfaith in God.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nNot in Our Own Strength\u2014I appeal to you, my brethren in the\nministry. Connect yourselves more closely with the work of God.\nMany souls that might be saved, will be lost, unless you strive more\nearnestly to make your work as perfect as possible. There is a great\nwork to be done in -----. It may seem to move slowly and hard at\nfirst; but God will work mightily through you if you will only make\nan entire surrender to Him. Much of the time you will have to walk[64]\nby faith, not by feeling....\nWherever you are, however trying your circumstances, do not\ntalk discouragement. The Bible is full of rich promises. Can you\nnot believe them? When we go out to labor for souls, God does not\nwant us to go a warfare at our own charges. What does this mean? It\nmeans that we need not go in our own strength, for God has pledged\nHis word that He will go with us.\u2014Historical Sketches, 128, 129\n(1886).\nMoving Forward by Faith 63\nIn the Early Days \u2014At God\u2019s command, \u201cGo forward,\u201d we\nadvanced when the difficulties to be surmounted made the advance\nseem impossible. We know how much it has cost to work out God\u2019s\nplans in the past, which have made us, as a people, what we are.\nThen let everyone be exceedingly careful not to unsettle minds in\nregard to those things that God has ordained for our prosperity and\nsuccess in advancing His cause.\u2014Letter 32, 1892.\nLeave Results With God\u2014The good seed sown may lie some\ntime in a cold, worldly, selfish heart, without evidencing that it has\ntaken root; but frequently the Spirit of God operates upon that heart,\nand waters it with the dew of heaven, and the long-hidden seed\nsprings up and finally bears fruit to the glory of God. We know\nnot in our lifework which shall prosper, this or that. These are not\nquestions for us poor mortals to settle. We are to do our work,\nleaving the result with God.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:248\n(1872).\nHelp Working Churches\u2014Every conference, whether large or\nsmall, is responsible for earnest, solemn work in preparing a people\nfor the coming of Christ. Those churches in the conference that\nare willing to work, and are in need of help in order to know how [65]\nto do effective work, should have the needed assistance. Let every\nconference worker become wide-awake to make his conference\nan intensely active agency for the upbuilding of the work of God.\nLet every church member become a working member, to build up\nspiritual interests. In holy love, by humble prayer and earnest work,\nlet the ministers act their part.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1908.\nGod\u2019s Hand on Wheel \u2014Fearful perils are before those who\nbear responsibilities in the cause of God\u2014perils the thought of which\nmake me tremble. But the word comes, \u201cMy hand is upon the wheel,\nand I will not allow men to control My work for these last days. My\nhand is turning the wheel, and My providence will continue to work\nout the divine plans, irrespective of human inventions.\u201d...\nIn the great closing work we shall meet with perplexities that\nwe know not how to deal with, but let us not forget that the three\ngreat powers of heaven are working, that a divine hand is on the\nwheel, and that God will bring His purposes to pass.\u2014Manuscript\n118, 1902.\n64 Evangelism\nFavor Until the Work Is Done \u2014A world is to be warned.\nWatch, wait, pray, work, and let nothing be done through strife\nand vainglory. Let nothing be done to increase prejudice, but every-\nthing possible to make prejudice less, by letting in light, the bright\nrays of the Sun of Righteousness amid the moral darkness. There\nis a great work to be done yet, and every effort possible must be\nmade to reveal Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour, Christ as the\nsin-bearer, Christ as the bright and morning star, and the Lord will\ngive us favor before the world until our work is done.\u2014Letter 35,\n1895.\nEvangelism of the Highest Type [66]\nWith Graceful Dignity and Simplicity \u2014Those who do the\nwork of the Lord in the cities must put forth calm, steady, devoted ef-\nfort for the education of the people. While they are to labor earnestly\nto interest the hearers, and to hold this interest, yet at the same time\nthey must carefully guard against anything that borders on sensa-\ntionalism. In this age of extravagance and outward show, when\nmen think it necessary to make a display in order to gain success,\nGod\u2019s chosen messengers are to show the fallacy of spending means\nneedlessly for effect. As they labor with simplicity, humility, and\ngraceful dignity, avoiding everything of a theatrical nature, their\nwork will make a lasting impression for good.\nThere is a necessity, it is true, for expending money judiciously\nin advertising the meetings, and in carrying forward the work solidly.\nYet the strength of every worker will be found to lie, not in these\noutward agencies, but in trustful dependence upon God, in earnest\nprayer to Him for help, in obedience to His Word. Much more prayer,\nmuch more Christlikeness, much more conformity to God\u2019s will, is\nto be brought into the Lord\u2019s work. Outward show and extravagant\noutlay of means will not accomplish the work to be done.\nGod\u2019s work is to be carried forward with power. We need the\nbaptism of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand that God will\nadd to the ranks of His people men of ability and influence who\nare to act their part in warning the world. Not all in the world are\nlawless and sinful. God has many thousands who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal. There are God-fearing men and women in the fallen\nchurches. If this were not so, we would not be given the message\nto bear: \u201cBabylon the great is fallen, is fallen.\u201d \u201cCome out of her, [67]\nMy people.\u201d Many of the honest in heart are gasping for a breath of\nlife from heaven. They will recognize the gospel when it is brought\nto them in the beauty and simplicity with which it is presented in\nGod\u2019s Word.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:109-111 (1909).\n65\n66 Evangelism\nGifted, Experienced Laborers for New City Fields\u2014Experi-\nenced laborers should be given the work of entering new places. A\ncourse is to be pursued that will maintain the sacred dignity of the\nwork. We are ever to remember that evil angels are watching for\nopportunities to defeat our efforts.\nThe cities are to be worked. A season of great trial is before us.\nThen let none lift up the soul unto vanity. It becomes those who are\nstriving for the crown of life to strive lawfully. All our capabilities\nand gifts are to be used in the work of saving perishing souls, thus\nwinning others to become co-laborers with Christ. The knowledge\nand powers that the Lord has given men and women will be largely\nincreased as they work to build up His kingdom.\u2014Manuscript 19,\n1910.\nElevated, Refined, Conscientious Manner\u2014 Throughout the\nages, God has been particular as to the design and the accomplish-\nment of His work. In this age, He has given His people much light\nand instruction in regard to how His work is to be carried forward\u2014\nin an elevated, refined, conscientious manner; and He is pleased\nwith those who in their service carry out His design.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, September 14, 1905.\nOn a High Plane \u2014During the years of Christ\u2019s ministry on\nearth, godly women assisted in the work that the Saviour and His\ndisciples were carrying forward. If those who were opposing this\nwork could have found anything out of the regular order in the[68]\nconduct of these women, it would have closed the work at once.\nBut while women were laboring with Christ and the apostles, the\nentire work was conducted on so high a plane as to be above the\nshadow of a suspicion. No occasion for any accusation could be\nfound. The minds of all were directed to the Scriptures, rather than\nto individuals. The truth was proclaimed intelligently, and so plainly\nthat all could understand....\nIn this message there is a beautiful consistency that appeals to the\njudgment. We cannot allow excitable elements among us to display\nthemselves in a way that would destroy our influence with those\nwhom we wish to reach with the truth.\u2014Manuscript 115, 1908.\nAvoid Undignified Methods\u2014While it is well to exercise econ-\nomy, let the work of God ever stand in its elevated noble dignity....\nDo not cheapen the work of God. Let it stand forth as from God; let\nEvangelism of the Highest Type 67\nit bear no human impress, but the impress of the divine. Self is to be\nlost sight of in Jesus....\nThere has been much lost through following the mistaken ideas\nof our good brethren whose plans were narrow, and they lowered\nthe work to their peculiar ways and ideas, so that the higher classes\nwere not reached. The appearance of the work impressed the minds\nof unbelievers as being of very little worth\u2014some stray offshoot of\nreligious theory, that was beneath their attention. Much has been\nlost for want of wise methods of labor.\nEvery effort should be made to give dignity and character to the\nwork. Special efforts should be made to secure the good will of men\nin responsible positions, without sacrificing one principle of truth\nor righteousness, but by sacrificing our own ways and manner of\napproaching the people. Much more would be effected by using [69]\nmore tact and discretion in the presentation of the truth.\u2014Letter 12,\n1887.\nDoctrine Must Bear Scrutiny of Great Men \u2014\u201cSearch the\nScriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life.\u201d Every po-\nsition of truth taken by our people will bear the criticism of the\ngreatest minds; the highest of the world\u2019s great men will be brought\nin contact with truth, and therefore every position we take should be\ncritically examined and tested by the Scriptures. Now we seem to\nbe unnoticed, but this will not always be. Movements are at work\nto bring us to the front, and if our theories of truth can be picked to\npieces by historians or the world\u2019s greatest men, it will be done.\nWe must individually know for ourselves what is truth, and be\nprepared to give a reason of the hope that we have with meekness\nand fear, not in a proud, boasting, self-sufficiency, but with the spirit\nof Christ. We are nearing the time when we shall stand individually\nalone to answer for our belief. Religious errors are multiplying and\nentwining themselves with Satanic power about the people. There is\nscarcely a doctrine of the Bible that has not been denied.\u2014Letter 6,\n1886.\nThe Evangelist and His Team\nEvangelism and Evangelists \u2014When I think of the cities in\nwhich so little work has been done, in which there are so many\nthousands to be warned of the soon coming of the Saviour, I feel an\nintensity of desire to see men and women going forth to the work in\nthe power of the Spirit filled with Christ\u2019s love for perishing souls....\nMy mind is deeply stirred. In every city there is work to be done.\nLaborers are to go into our large cities and hold camp meetings.[70]\nIn these meetings, the very best talent is to be employed, that the\ntruth may be proclaimed with power. Men of varied gifts are to be\nbrought in....\nNew methods must be introduced. God\u2019s people must awake\nto the necessities of the time in which they are living. God has\nmen whom He will call into His service,\u2014men who will not carry\nforward the work in the lifeless way in which it has been carried\nforward in the past....\nIn our large cities the message is to go forth as a lamp that\nburneth. God will raise up laborers for this work, and His angels will\ngo before them. Let no one hinder these men of God\u2019s appointment.\nForbid them not. God has given them their work. Let the message be\ngiven with so much power that the hearers shall be convinced.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, September 30, 1902.\nStrong Men Needed\u2014I call upon our ministering brethren to\nconsider this matter. Let strong men be appointed to work in the\ngreat centers.\u2014Manuscript 25, 1908.\nA Variety of Talent\u2014In our tent meetings we must have speak-\ners who can make a good impression on the people. The ability\nof one man, however intelligent this man may be, is insufficient to\nmeet the need. A variety of talents should be brought into these\nmeetings.\u2014Manuscript 104, 1902.\nSecond Man a Good Investment\u2014The Lord designs that His\nwork shall be carried solidly. To enter a new field involves large\nexpense. But the extra expense of a second man to help Brother\n68\nEvangelist and His Team 69\n_____ will be an investment that will bring returns. I feel to urge\nthis matter because so much is at stake. I pray the Lord to impress [71]\nyour minds to carry out His will.\u2014Letter 261, 1905.\nHolding Large Audiences\u2014The Lord has given to some min-\nisters the ability to gather and to hold large congregations. As they\nlabor in the fear of God, their efforts will be attended by the deep\nmovings of the Holy Spirit upon human hearts....\nI am charged to wake up the watchmen. The end of all things is at\nhand. Now is the accepted time. Let our ministers and presidents of\nconferences exercise their tact and skill in presenting the truth before\nlarge numbers of people in our cities. As you labor in simplicity,\nhearts will be melted. Bear in mind that as you deliver the testing\nmessage for this time, your own heart will be softened and quickened\nby the subduing influence of the Holy Spirit, and you will have\nsouls for your hire. As you stand before multitudes in the cities,\nremember that God is your helper, and that by His blessing you may\nbear a message of a character to reach the hearts of the hearers.\u2014\nManuscript 53, 1910.\nMen and Women to Teach Truth\u2014Wise teachers\u2014men and\nwomen who are apt in teaching the truths of the Word\u2014are needed\nin our cities. Let these present the truth in all its sacred dignity, and\nwith sanctified simplicity.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 25,\n1912.\nPaul a Traveling Evangelist\u2014Paul\u2019s was a life of intense and\nvaried activities. From city to city, from country to country, he\njourneyed, telling the story of the cross, winning converts to the\ngospel, and establishing churches.\u2014Gospel Workers, 58, 59 (1915).\nStrong, Courageous Workers \u2014Feeble or aged men and\nwomen should not be sent to labor in unhealthful, crowded cities.\nLet them labor where their lives will not be needlessly sacrificed. [72]\nOur brethren who bring the truth to the cities must not be obliged to\nimperil their health in the noise and bustle and confusion, if retired\nplaces can be secured.\nThose who are engaged in the difficult and trying work in the\ncities should receive every encouragement possible. Let them not\nbe subjected to unkind criticism from their brethren. We must have\na care for the Lord\u2019s workers who are opening the light of truth to\nthose who are in the darkness of error.\u2014Letter 168, 1909.\nAdvantages of Two and Two\nJesus Sent Out Brother With Brother \u2014Calling the twelve\nabout Him, Jesus bade them go out two and two through the towns\nand villages. None were sent forth alone, but brother was associated\nwith brother, friend with friend. Thus they could help and encourage\neach other, counseling and praying together, each one\u2019s strength\nsupplementing the other\u2019s weakness. In the same manner He after-\nward sent forth the seventy. It was the Saviour\u2019s purpose that the\nmessengers of the gospel should be associated in this way. In our\nown time evangelistic work would be far more successful if this\nexample were more closely followed.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 350\n(1898).\nGod\u2019s Plan for the Work Today\u2014When Jesus sent His disci-\nples forth to labor, ... they did not feel as some do now, that they\nwould rather work alone than have anyone with them who did not\nlabor just as they labored. Our Saviour understood what ones to\nassociate together. He did not connect with the mild, beloved John\none of the same temperament; but He connected with him the ardent,\nimpulsive Peter. These two men were not alike either in their dispo-[73]\nsition or in their manner of labor. Peter was prompt and zealous in\naction, bold and uncompromising, and would often wound; John was\never calm, and considerate of others\u2019 feelings, and would come after\nto bind up and encourage. Thus the defects in one were partially\ncovered by the virtues in the other. [See also pp. 103-107, \u201cAllowing\nfor More Than One Man\u2019s Method.\u201d]\nGod never designed that, as a rule, His servants should go out\nsingly to labor. To illustrate: Here are two brothers. They are not of\nthe same temperament; their minds do not run in the same channel.\nOne is in danger of doing too much; the other fails to carry the\nburdens that he should. If associated together, these might have a\nmolding influence upon each other, so that the extremes in their\ncharacters would not stand out so prominently in their labors. It\nmight not be necessary for them to be together in every meeting; but\n70\nAdvantages of Two and Two 71\nthey could labor in places ten, fifteen or even thirty miles apart,\u2014\nnear enough together, however, so that if one came to a crisis in his\nlabors, he could call on the other for assistance. They should also\ncome together as often as possible for prayer and consultation....\nWhen one labors alone continually, he is apt to think that his way\nis above criticism, and he feels no particular desire to have anyone\nlabor with him. But it is Christ\u2019s plan that someone should stand\nright by his side, so that the work shall not be molded entirely by\none man\u2019s mind, and so that his defects of character shall not be\nregarded as virtues by himself or by those who hear him.\nUnless a speaker has one by his side with whom he can share the\nlabor, he will many times be placed in circumstances where he will\nbe obliged to do violence to the laws of life and health. Then, again, [74]\nimportant things sometimes transpire to call him away right in the\ncrisis of an interest. If two are connected in labor, the work at such\ntimes need not be left alone.\u2014Historical Sketches, 126, 127 (1886).\nAdvantages of United Labor\u2014There is need of two working\ntogether; for one can encourage the other, and they can counsel,\npray, and search the Bible together. In this they may get a broader\nlight upon the truth; for one will see one phase, and the other another\nphase of the truth. If they are erring, they can correct one another\nin speech and attitude, so that the truth may not be lightly esteemed\nbecause of the defects of its advocates. If the workers are sent out\nalone, there is no one to see or correct their errors; but when two\ngo together, an educating work may be carried on, and each worker\nbecome what he should be\u2014a successful soul winner.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, July 4, 1893.\nWhy Not Today?\u2014Why is it that we have departed from the\nmethod of labor which was instituted by the Great Teacher? Why is\nit that the laborers in His cause today are not sent forth two and two?\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say, \u201cwe have not laborers enough to occupy the field.\u201d\nThen occupy less territory. Send forth the laborers into the places\nwhere the way seems to be opened, and teach the precious truth for\nthis time. Can we not see the wisdom of having two go together to\npreach the gospel?\u2014The Review and Herald, April 19, 1892.\nThe Evangelistic Site\n\u201cStudy Your Location\u201d\u2014Enter the large cities, and create an\ninterest among the high and the low. Make it your work to preach\nthe gospel to the poor, but do not stop there. Seek to reach the[75]\nhigher classes also. Study your location with a view to letting your\nlight shine forth to others. This work should have been done long\nsince.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 400 (1896).\nWork in Halls\u2014Let halls be hired, and let the message be given\nwith such power that the hearers will be convinced. God will raise up\nworkers who will occupy peculiar spheres of influence, workers who\nwill carry the truth to the most unpromising places.\u2014Manuscript\n127, 1901.\nLarge Halls in Our Cities\u2014The large halls in our cities should\nbe secured, that the third angel\u2019s message may be proclaimed by\nhuman lips. Thousands will appreciate the message.\u2014Letter 35,\n1895.\nThe Most Popular Halls\u2014It requires money to carry the mes-\nsage of warning to the cities. It is sometimes necessary to hire at\nlarge expense the most popular halls, in order that we may call the\npeople out. Then we can give them Bible evidence of the truth.\u2014\nManuscript 114, 1905.\nBegin Cautiously\u2014I have been and still am instructed regard-\ning the necessities required for the work in the cities. We must\nquietly secure buildings, without defining all we intend to do. We\nmust use great wisdom in what we say, lest our way be hedged up.\nLucifer is an ingenious worker, drawing from our people all possible\nknowledge, that he may, if possible, defeat the plans laid to arouse\nour cities. On some points silence is eloquence.\u2014Letter 84, 1910.\nLease Good Halls\u2014In some places the work must begin in a\nsmall way, and advance slowly. This is all that the laborers can do.\nBut in many cases a wider and more decided effort might be made\nat the outset, with good results. The work in _____ might now be[76]\nmuch further advanced than it is if our brethren, at the beginning of\n72\nEvangelistic Site 73\nthe work there, had not tried to work in so cheap a way. If they had\nhired good halls, and carried forward the work as though we had\ngreat truths, which would surely be victorious, they would have had\ngreater success. God would have the work started in such a way that\nthe first impressions given shall be, as far as they go, the very best\nthat can be made.\u2014Gospel Workers, 462 (1915).\nTents Pitched in Most Favorable Places\u2014We must carry the\ntruth to the cities. Tents are to be pitched in the most favorable\nplaces, and meetings held.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 25, 1905.\nCare of Tent Ground\u2014Elder _____ has had the big camp meet-\ning tent pitched in Oakland. During the preparations he was right on\nhand to direct, and worked very hard to have the grounds approach-\ning the tent as presentable as possible.\u2014Letter 352, 1906\nAdvantages of a Portable Meetinghouse \u2014I wish that you\nmight have a portable meetinghouse. This would be much more\nfavorable for your work than would a tent, especially in the rainy\nseason.\u2014Letter 376, 1906.\nThe Outpost Centers\nFrom Outpost Centers \u2014It is God\u2019s design that our people\nshould locate outside the cities, and from these outposts warn the\ncities, and raise in them memorials for God. There must be a force of\ninfluence in the cities, that the message of warning shall be heard.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, April 14, 1903.\nAs a Barrier to Contaminating Influence \u2014We must make\nwise plans to warn the cities, and at the same time live where we[77]\ncan shield our children and ourselves from the contaminating and\ndemoralizing influences so prevalent in these places.\u2014Life Sketches,\np. 410. (1915).\nLow-priced Rural Properties\u2014We are to be wise as serpents\nand harmless as doves in our efforts to secure country properties\nat a low figure, and from these outpost centers we are to work the\ncities.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 14, p. 7. (1902).\nIn Easy Access to the Cities\u2014Let men of sound judgment be\nappointed, not to publish abroad their intentions, but to search for\nsuch properties in the rural districts, in easy access to the cities,\nsuitable for small training schools for workers, and where facilities\nmay also be provided for treating the sick and weary souls who know\nnot the truth. Look for such places just out from the large cities,\nwhere suitable buildings may be secured, either as a gift from the\nowners, or purchased at a reasonable price by the gifts of our people.\nDo not erect buildings in the noisy cities.\u2014Medical Ministry, 308,\n309 (1909).\nWorking in, but Not Living in, Cities\u2014The truth must be spo-\nken, whether men will hear, or whether men will forbear. The cities\nare filled with temptation. We should plan our work in such a way as\nto keep our young people as far as possible from this contamination.\nThe cities are to be worked from outposts. Said the messenger\nof God, \u201cShall not the cities be warned? Yes, not by God\u2019s people\nliving in them, but by their visiting them, to warn them of what is\ncoming upon the earth.\u201d\u2014Letter 182, 1902.\n74\nOutpost Centers 75\nAs Did Enoch\u2014As God\u2019s commandment-keeping people, we\nmust leave the cities. As did Enoch, we must work in the cities but [78]\nnot dwell in them.\u2014Manuscript 85, 1899.\nLessons From Lot and Enoch \u2014When iniquity abounds in a\nnation, there is always to be heard some voice giving warning and\ninstruction, as the voice of Lot was heard in Sodom. Yet Lot could\nhave preserved his family from many evils had he not made his\nhome in this wicked, polluted city. All that Lot and his family did in\nSodom could have been done by them, even if they had lived in a\nplace some distance away from the city. Enoch walked with God,\nand yet he did not live in the midst of any city polluted with every\nkind of violence and wickedness, as did Lot in Sodom.\u2014Manuscript\n94, 1903.\nPlanning Sectional and Suburban Meetings\nLarge Cities\u2014Evangelistic Meetings in Different Areas \u2014\nNow is the opportune time to work the cities; for we must reach the\npeople there. As a people we have been in danger of centering too\nmany important interests in one place. This is not good judgment\nnor wisdom. An interest is now to be created in the principal cities.\nMany small centers must be established, rather than a few large\ncenters....\nLet missionaries be laboring two and two in different parts of\nall our large cities. The workers in each city should frequently meet\ntogether for counsel and prayer, that they may have wisdom and\ngrace to work together effectively and harmoniously. Let all be wide\nawake to make the most of every advantage. Our people must gird\nthe armor on and establish centers in all the large cities.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 300 (1909).\nReaching the Unwarned Sections of Our Cities\u2014There is to[79]\nbe an increased force of working agencies in every part of the field.\nLet the laborers go out two and two, that they may work together in\nthe many parts of our cities that have been left unwarned for a long\ntime.\u2014Letter 8, 1910.\nEvery Part to Be Worked\u2014Let a band of workers go to a city\nand work earnestly to proclaim the truth in every part of it. Let them\ncounsel together as to the best way of carrying on the work in the\nmost inexpensive manner. They are to do thorough work and are ever\nto keep the spiritual phase of their effort uppermost.\u2014Manuscript\n42, 1905.\nTents Repitched to Reach Various Sections of City \u2014Much\nwiser generalship should be shown in the location of camp meetings;\nthey should not be held in out-of-the-way places, for in the cities\nthere are people who need the truth. Camp meetings are to be held\nin places from which the people of our large cities can be reached....\nCamp meetings must be held in or near the cities, the workers at\none time pitching the tent in one part of the city and the next time in\n76\nPlanning Sectional and Suburban Meetings 77\nanother part. Right at our doors there are heathen who need to hear\nthe warning message. In the large cities of America memorials for\nGod are to be established.\u2014Letter 164, 1901.\nPlanning for a Permanent Work\n[See also pp. 321-326, \u201cBinding Off Thoroughly.\u201d]\nSurface Plowing\u2014A Limited Harvest\u2014We are in danger of\nspreading over more territory and starting more enterprises than we\ncan possibly attend to properly, and they will become a wearing[80]\nburden in absorbing means. There is danger to be guarded against of\noverdoing some branches of the work and leaving some important\nparts of the Lord\u2019s vineyard to be neglected. To undertake and plan\na large amount of work and do nothing perfectly, would be a bad\nplan. We are to move forward, but only in the counsel of God.\nWe must not get so far above the simplicity of the work we lose\nour spiritual perception and it will be impossible to look after the\nmany accumulated lines of work and enterprises entered into without\nsacrificing our best helpers to keep things in order. Life and health\nmust be regarded.\nWhile we should ever be ready to follow the opening providence\nof God, we should lay no larger plans in places where our work is\nrepresented, nor occupy more ground than there is help and means to\nbind off the work well. Surface plowing means a limited, scattered\nharvest. Keep up and increase the interest already started, until the\ncloud moves, then follow it. While there are broader plans and\nfields constantly opening for the laborers, our ideas and views must\nbroaden in regard to the workers who are to labor in new fields in\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard to bring souls into the truth.\u2014Letter 14, 1886.\nSpreading Too Thin\u2014Let not the means at your disposal be\nspent in so many places that nothing satisfactory is accomplished\nanywhere. It is possible for the workers to spread their efforts over so\nmuch territory that nothing will be properly done in the very places\nwhere, by the Lord\u2019s direction, the work should be strengthened and\nperfected.\u2014Letter 87, 1902.\nThoroughness in Evangelistic Details\u2014If our active tempera-\nment gathers in a large amount of work that we have not strength\n78\nPlanning for a Permanent Work 79\nnor the grace of Christ to do understandingly and with order and [81]\nexactitude, everything we undertake shows imperfection, and the\nwork is constantly marred. God is not glorified however good the\nmotive. There is a want of wisdom which is too plainly revealed.\nThe worker complains of constantly having too heavy burdens to\nbear, when God is not pleased with his taking these burdens; and\nhe makes his own life one of worriment and anxiety and weariness,\nbecause he will not learn the lessons Christ has given him: to wear\nHis yoke and bear His burdens rather than the yoke and burdens of\nhis own creating....\nGod wants intelligent workers, doing their work not hurriedly but\ncarefully and thoroughly, always preserving the humility of Jesus.\nThose who put thought and painstaking into the higher duties, should\nput care and thought into the smaller duties, showing exactitude and\ndiligence. Oh, how much neglected work is done, how much leaving\nthings at loose ends because there is a constant desire to take on\ngreater work. The work is slurred over that relates to the service\nof God, because they pile so much work before them that there is\nnothing done thoroughly. But all the work must bear the scrutiny\nof the Judge of all the earth. The smaller duties connected with\nthe service of the Master assume importance because it is Christ\u2019s\nservice.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nNo New Interests Till Others Bound Off\u2014We must not plan\nfor large beginnings while we have so little power to complete that\nwhich is already begun. Let not new enterprises come in before their\ntime, to absorb in other places the means that ought to be used to\nbuild up the work in_____. The interests in that place must be firmly\nestablished before other territory is entered.\u2014Letter 87, 1902.\nMaintaining Interest for the Message \u2014The experiences of [82]\nthis meeting, with what has been presented to me at various times\nregarding the holding of camp meetings in large cities, lead me to\nadvise that a larger number of camp meetings be held each year,\neven though some of them are small; for these meetings will be a\npowerful means of arresting the attention of the masses. By camp\nmeetings held in the cities, thousands will be called out to hear the\ninvitation to the feast, \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d\nAfter arousing an interest, we must not cut these meetings short,\npulling down the tents, leaving the people to think that the meeting\n80 Evangelism\nis over, just at the time when hundreds are becoming interested. It\nis just then that the greatest good may be accomplished by faithful,\nearnest work. The meetings must be so managed that the public\ninterest shall be maintained.\nIt may be difficult, sometimes, to hold the principal speakers\nfor some weeks to develop the interest awakened by the meeting;\nit may be expensive to retain the grounds, and to keep standing a\nsufficient number of the family tents to maintain the appearance of a\ncamp meeting; it may be at a sacrifice that several families remain\ncamping on the grounds, to assist the ministers and Bible workers\nin visiting and in holding Bible study with those who come on the\ngrounds, and in visiting the people at their homes, telling them of\nthe blessings received at the meetings, and inviting them to come;\nbut the results will be worthy of the effort. It is by such earnest,\nenergetic efforts as these that some of our camp meetings have been\ninstrumental in raising up strong, working churches; and it is by just\nsuch earnest work that the third angel\u2019s message must be carried to\nthe people of our cities.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 4, 1899.\nOrganized Protracted Effort\u2014Sometimes a large number of[83]\nspeakers attend a camp meeting for a few days; and just when the\ninterest of the people is beginning to be fully aroused, nearly all\nhurry away to another meeting, leaving two or three speakers behind\nto struggle against the depressing influence of the tearing down and\nremoval of all the family tents.\nHow much better it would be in many cases, if the meetings were\ncontinued for a longer time; if persons would come from each church,\nprepared to remain a month or longer, helping in the meetings, and\nlearning how to labor acceptably. Then they could carry a valuable\nexperience to their churches when they return home. How much\nbetter if some of the same speakers who arouse the interest of the\npeople during the largest attendance at the meeting would remain\nto follow up the work begun, by a thoroughly organized protracted\neffort.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 4, 1899.\nLeaving the Harvest Ungarnered \u2014It would be better, and\naccomplish more good, if there were fewer tent meetings, and a\nstronger force, or company, with different gifts to labor. Then there\nshould be a longer tarry in a place where an interest is awakened.\n[Note.\u2014The tent meeting when this was written was of only a few\nPlanning for a Permanent Work 81\ndays\u2019 duration.\u2014Compiler.] There has been too much haste in tak-\ning down the tent. Some begin to be favorably impressed, and there\nis need that persevering efforts be put forth till their minds become\nsettled, and they commit themselves on the truth.\nIn many places where the tent has been pitched, the ministers\nstay till the prejudice begins to wear away, and some would then\nlisten with minds free from prejudice; but just then the tent is taken\ndown, and sent on its way to another place. The rounds are gone [84]\nover, time and means spent, and the servants of God can see but very\nlittle accomplished through the tent season. But few are brought to\nacknowledge the truth, and God\u2019s servants, having seen but very little\nto cheer and encourage them, and call out the gift within them, lose\ninstead of gaining in strength, spirituality, and power.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 1:148 (1857).\nFollow-Up Workers\u2014I have been thinking of how it used to be\nwhen the loud cry of the first angel\u2019s message was given in Portland\nand in the city of Boston. These efforts were followed up with\ncontinuous work similar to that which you, Elder _____ and Sister\n_____, and your helpers are doing. This work is indeed the Lord\u2019s\nwork.\u2014Letter 182, 1906.\nLocate Families to Hold the Interest Awakened\u2014Then there\nis Toronto [Australia], a pleasure resort. These places are all within\nten and twenty miles of Cooranbong, and must be entered as soon\nas we can find consecrated families whom we can locate there to\nhold the interest awakened. All these fields are white for the harvest,\nbut we can do nothing without devoted workers, who can enter and\narouse and hold an interest.\u2014Letter 76, 1899.\nA Wise Generalship Needed\u2014Wise generalship is needed in\nthe selection of fields of labor. Plans should be made before a field is\nentered, [as to] how these souls are to be cared for. Who will minister\nunto these who shall take hold of the truth? They have accepted an\nunpopular truth. Who will educate them after they have learned their\nABC\u2019s? Who will give the spiritual mold to their experience?\nTo labor at considerable expense to bring souls into the truth and\nthen leave them to fashion their own experience according to false\nideas they have received and woven into their religious experience, [85]\nwould leave that work far worse than if the truth had never been\nbrought to them. To leave the work incomplete and to ravel out is\n82 Evangelism\nworse than to wait until there are plans well devised to take care of\nthose who do come into the faith.\u2014Letter 60, 1886.\nFinance and the Budget\nSit Down and Count the Cost \u2014God\u2019s people are not to go\nforward blindly in the investment of means that they have not and\nknow not where to obtain. We must show wisdom in the movements\nthat we make. Christ has laid before us the plan upon which His\nwork is to be conducted. Those who desire to build must first sit\ndown and count the cost, to see whether they are able to carry the\nbuilding to completion. Before they begin to carry out their plans,\nthey must advise with wise counselors. If one worker, failing to\nreason from cause to effect, is in danger of making unwise moves,\nhis fellow workers are to speak words of wisdom to him, showing\nhim where he is in error.\u2014Letter 182, 1902.\nStrict Economy\u2014Let all who take up the work in our large\ncities be careful in this respect\u2014in no place should there be any\nneedless expenditure of money. It is not by outward display that men\nand women are to learn what is comprehended by present truth. Our\nworkers are to practice strict economy. God forbids all extravagance.\nEvery dollar at our command is to be expended with economy. No\ngreat display is to be made. God\u2019s money is to be used to carry\nforward in His own way the work that He has declared must be done\nin our world.\u2014Letter 107, 1905.\nBegin Without Display\u2014Why should we delay to begin work [86]\nin our cities? We are not to wait for some wonderful thing to be done,\nor some costly apparatus to be provided, in order that a great display\nmay be made. What is the chaff to the wheat? If we walk and work\nhumbly before God, He will prepare the way before us.\u2014Letter 335,\n1904.\nBalanced Evangelism\u2014God forbid that there should be a large\noutlay of means in a few places, without considering the needs of\nthe many fields that have scarcely any help. Self-denial exercised by\nthe brethren in favored localities in order that adequate help may be\ngiven to needy fields, will aid in accomplishing a work that will bring\nglory to God. None can afford to build a high tower of influence\n83\n84 Evangelism\nin one locality, while they leave other places unworked. The Lord\ngrant that our senses may be sanctified, and that we may learn to\nmeasure our ideas by the work and the teachings of Christ.\u2014Letter\n320, 1908.\nBearing Expense of a Worker\u2014In the great cities many agen-\ncies are to be set at work. Those who are so situated that they cannot\nact a part in personal labor, may interest themselves in bearing the\nexpenses of a laborer who can go. Let not our brethren and sis-\nters make excuses for not engaging in earnest work. No practical\nChristian lives to himself.\u2014Manuscript 128, 1901.\nChurches Finance New Work\u2014Those who know the truth are\nto strengthen one another, saying to the ministers, \u201cGo forth into\nthe harvest field in the name of the Lord, and our prayers shall go\nwith you as sharp sickles.\u201d Thus our churches should bear decided\nwitness for God, and they should also bring Him their gifts and\nofferings, that those who go forth into the field may have wherewith[87]\nto labor for souls.\u2014Manuscript 73a, 1900.\nGod\u2019s Provision for City Work \u2014I have had messages from\nthe Lord, which I have given to our people over and over again, that\nthere are many monied men who are susceptible to the influences\nand impressions of the gospel message. The Lord has a people\nwho have never yet heard the truth. Keep to your work, and let the\nproperty that shall be donated to the advancement of the truth be so\nused that a center shall be established in _____. Let proper persons,\nwho have never revealed the selfish, grasping spirit which withholds\nthe means that ought to be used in the large cities, be selected to\ncarry forward the work, because God acknowledges them as His\nchosen ones....\nGod will move upon the hearts of monied men, when the Bible,\nand the Bible alone, is presented as the light of the world. In these\ncities the truth is to go forth as a lamp that burneth.\nThe question has been asked, Why have you made a specialty\nof laboring for the lowest, most debased class, passing by the men\nof discrimination and talent? There is a field all ripe for the harvest,\nand the Lord has means whereby this field shall be worked. There\nare men of large business capabilities who will accept the truth, men\nwho trust in the Scriptures, who, from the treasure house of the heart\ncan bring forth things new and old. Controlled by the Holy Spirit,\nFinance and the Budget 85\nthese men will move in a way that will clear away obstructions, so\nthat the people may be warned of the soon coming of the Lord....\nIn many testimonies I have stated that wealthy men, who have\ntheir Lord\u2019s money, will be moved by the Spirit of God to open doors\nfor the advancement of the truth in large cities. They will use their\nentrusted means to prepare the way of the Lord, to make straight in [88]\nthe desert a highway for our God.\nThose who work in the large cities are to reach if possible to\nthe high ones of the world, even to ruling powers. Where is our\nfaith? God has presented to me the case of Nebuchadnezzar. The\nLord worked with power to bring the mightiest king on the earth to\nacknowledge Him as King over all kings. He moved upon the mind\nof the proud king until Nebuchadnezzar acknowledged Him as \u201cthe\nmost high God,\u201d \u201cwhose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and\nHis kingdom is from generation to generation.\u201d\u2014Letter 132, 1901.\nSolicit the Wealthy\u2014Let those who labor in the interests of the\ncause of God lay the necessities of the work in _____ before the\nwealthy men of the world. Do this judiciously. Tell them what you\nare trying to do. Solicit donations from them. It is God\u2019s means\nwhich they have, means which should be used in enlightening the\nworld.\nThere are stored up in the earth large treasures of gold and silver.\nMen\u2019s riches have accumulated. Go to these men with a heart filled\nwith love for Christ and suffering humanity, and ask them to help\nyou in the work you are trying to do for the Master. As they see\nthat you reveal the sentiments of God\u2019s benevolence, a chord will be\ntouched in their hearts. They will realize that they can be Christ\u2019s\nhelping hand by doing medical missionary work. They will be led\nto co-operate with God, to provide the facilities necessary to set in\noperation the work that needs to be done.\u2014Manuscript 40, 1901.\nOthers, Too, Must Have Facilities \u2014Elder_____ uses with\nprodigality money that should go to the sustaining of workers in\ndifferent parts of the field. He needs to remember that others besides [89]\nhim are to have opportunity to use their talents in the Lord\u2019s work.\nAnd they are to be given facilities for work, so that they can labor\nwithout sacrificing health and even life itself. One worker is not\nto absorb a large amount of money to carry on his line of work\naccording to his own plans, leaving his fellow worker without the\n86 Evangelism\nmeans he ought to have in order to do the work assigned him. Even\nif this money comes from outsiders, it is still the Lord\u2019s money. God\nhas not ordained that one worker should have a superabundance,\nwhile his fellow worker is so bound about by a lack of means that he\ncannot accomplish the work that should be done.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nConverted Souls to Provide Means\u2014As men and women are\nbrought into the truth in the cities, the means will begin to come\nin. As surely as honest souls will be converted, their means will be\nconsecrated to the Lord\u2019s service, and we shall see an increase of\nour resources.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1909.\nBuild Up a Reserve Fund\u2014Evangelistic work is not to be car-\nried on in the selfish, self-exalted manner in which Elder _____ has\ncarried it on. The means that come into the hands of the workers in\nthe Lord\u2019s cause belong to God and are to be used in an economical\nmanner. When large sums of money are given to the work, let a\nportion of the means be laid by; for there will be emergencies to\nmeet in the Lord\u2019s great vineyard.\u2014Letter 149, 1901.\nWise Management in New Fields\u2014There is great importance\nattached to the starting in right at the beginning of our work. I have\nbeen shown that the work in _____ has been bound about without\nmaking that decided advancement that it might have made if the\nwork had commenced right. Far more might have been done with[90]\ndifferent modes of management, and there would have been less\nmeans actually taken from the treasury. We have a great and sacred\ntrust in the elevated truths committed to us.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nEconomy Not to Excess\u2014While we are to be economical, we\nare not to carry economy to excess. It is one of the sad, strange things\nin life that great mistakes are sometimes made in carrying the virtue\nof self-sacrifice to an extreme. It is possible for the Lord\u2019s workers to\nbe presumptuous, and to carry too far the self-sacrifice that prompts\nthem to go without sufficient food and without sufficient clothing, in\norder that they may make every dollar go as far as possible. Some\nlaborers overwork and do without things they ought to have, because\nthere is not enough money in the treasury to sustain the number of\nworkers that ought to be in the field. There would be more money if\nall would work in accordance with Christ\u2019s injunction: \u201cWhosoever\nwill come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and\nfollow Me.\u201d\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nFinance and the Budget 87\nAvoid Petty Meanness\u2014The one object to be kept before the\nmind is that you are reformers and not bigots. In dealing with\nunbelievers, do not show a contemptible spirit of littleness, for if\nyou stop to haggle over a small sum, you will, in the end, lose a\nmuch larger sum. They will say, \u201cThat man is a sharper; he would\ncheat you out of your rights if he possibly could, so be on your guard\nwhen you have any dealing with him.\u201d But if in a deal a trifle in\nyour favor is placed to the favor of another, that other will work\nwith you on the same generous plan. Littleness begets littleness,\npenuriousness begets penuriousness. Those who pursue this course\ndo not see how contemptible it appears to others; especially those\nnot of our faith; and the precious cause of truth bears the stamp of [91]\nthis defect.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nThe Business Management of the Campaign\nMinisters Not Burdened With Business \u2014To every man is\ngiven his work. Those who enter the ministry engage in a special\nwork and should give themselves to prayer and to the speaking of the\nWord. Their minds should not be burdened with business matters.\nFor years the Lord has been instructing me to warn our ministering\nbrethren against allowing their minds to become so engrossed with\nbusiness matters that they will have no time to commune with God\nand to have fellowship with the Spirit. A minister cannot keep in the\nbest spiritual frame of mind while he is called upon to settle little\ndifficulties in the various churches. This is not his appointed work.\nGod desires to use every faculty of His chosen messengers. Their\nmind should not be wearied by long committee meetings at night,\nfor God wants all their brain power to be used in proclaiming the\ngospel clearly and forcibly as it is in Christ Jesus.\nOverburdened, a minister is often so hurried that he scarcely finds\ntime to examine himself, whether he be in the faith. He finds very\nlittle time to meditate and pray. Christ in His ministry united prayer\nwith work. Night after night He spent wholly in prayer. Ministers\nmust seek God for His Holy Spirit, in order that they may present\nthe truth aright.\u2014Manuscript 127, 1902.\nBusiness Details Carried by Men of Business Ability\u2014It is a\ngreat mistake to keep a minister who is gifted with power to preach\nthe gospel, constantly at work in business matters. He who holds[92]\nforth the Word of life is not to allow too many burdens to be placed\nupon him....\nThe finances of the cause are to be properly managed by busi-\nnessmen of ability; but preachers and evangelists are set apart for\nanother line of work. Let the management of financial matters rest\non others than those set apart for the work of preaching the gospel.\nOur ministers are not to be heavily burdened with the business de-\ntails of the evangelical work carried on in our large cities. Those\nin charge of our conferences should find businessmen to look after\n88\nBusiness Management of the Campaign 89\nthe financial details of city work. If such men cannot be found, let\nfacilities be provided for training men to bear these burdens.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, October 5, 1905.\n90 Evangelism\nSection 5\u2014Organizing for Evangelistic [93]\nMeetings\nMethods and Organization\nA Great Work by Simple Means\u2014The striking feature of di-\nvine operations is the accomplishment of the greatest work that can\nbe done in our world by very simple means. It is God\u2019s plan that\nevery part of His government shall depend on every other part, the\nwhole as a wheel within a wheel, working with entire harmony.\nHe moves upon human forces, causing His Spirit to touch invisible\nchords, and the vibration rings to the extremity of the universe.\u2014\nManuscript 22, 1897.\nSuccess the Result of Order and Harmonious Action \u2014God\nis a God of order. Everything connected with heaven is in perfect\norder; subjection and thorough discipline mark the movements of\nthe angelic host. Success can only attend order and harmonious\naction. God requires order and system in His work now no less\nthan in the days of Israel. All who are working for Him are to labor\nintelligently, not in a careless, haphazard manner. He would have\nHis work done with faith and exactness, that He may place the seal\nof His approval upon it.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, 376 (1890).\nFollowing an Organized Plan [Note:\u2014The necessity and ad-[94]\nvantages of thorough organization are here set forth in several state-\nments some of which were directed to institutional managers. These\nprinciples, however, applying to all lines of work, justify their in-\nclusion here.\u2014Compilers.]\u2014It is essential to labor with order, fol-\nlowing an organized plan and a definite object. No one can properly\ninstruct another unless he sees to it that the work to be done shall be\ntaken hold of systematically and in order, so that it may be done at\nthe proper time....\nWell-defined plans should be freely presented to all whom they\nmay concern, and it should be ascertained that they are understood.\nThen require of all those who are at the head of the various depart-\nments to cooperate in the execution of these plans. If this sure and\nradical method is properly adopted and followed up with interest and\n92\nMethods and Organization 93\ngood will, it will avoid much work being done without any definite\nobject, much useless friction.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1887.\nWell-understood Plans\u2014The work you are engaged in cannot\nbe done except by forces which are the result of well-understood\nplans.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nForethought, Order, and Prayer\u2014It is a sin to be heedless,\npurposeless, and indifferent in any work in which we may engage,\nbut especially in the work of God. Every enterprise connected with\nHis cause should be carried forward with order, forethought, and\nearnest prayer.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 18, 1884.\nThoroughness and Promptness\u2014It will be easy to make great\nblunders if the business is not looked after with clear and sharp atten-\ntion. Although the novice or apprentice may be energetic, if there is\nnot in the various departments someone to oversee, someone who is\nproperly qualified for his work, there will be failure in many respects.\nAs the work grows, it will become impossible even occasionally to\npostpone jobs from one date to another. What is not done in due [95]\ntime, be it in sacred or in secular matters, runs a great risk of not\nbeing done at all; in any case, such work can never be done so well\nas at the proper time.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1887.\nEach in His Proper Sphere\u2014To every man God has appointed\nhis work, according to his capacities and capabilities. Wise planning\nis needed to place each one in his proper sphere in the work, in order\nthat he may obtain an experience which will fit him to bear increased\nresponsibility.\u2014Letter 45, 1889.\nWork Like Disciplined Army\u2014Let us remember that we are\nlaborers together with God. We are not wise enough to work by\nourselves. God has made us His stewards, to prove us and to try\nus, even as He proved and tried ancient Israel. He will not have His\narmy composed of undisciplined, unsanctified, erratic soldiers, who\nwould misrepresent His order and purity.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nOctober 8, 1901.\nGenius to Plan and Work\u2014Genius is wanted, ability to devise\nand plan and work harmoniously. We want those who will labor,\nnot merely to benefit themselves, receiving all they can get for their\nwork, but who will labor with an eye single to the glory of God, for\nthe rapid carrying forward of the work in various lines. This is a\nprecious opportunity to reveal their devotion to the Lord\u2019s work, and\n94 Evangelism\ntheir capability for it. To every man is given his work, not for the\npurpose of glorifying himself, but for the glory of God.\u2014Manuscript\n25, 1895.\nWise Planning Saves Overwork\u2014I must urge that the workers\nshall have their work so planned that they will not become wearied\nby overwork.\u2014Letter 17, 1902.\nThe Evangelistic Company [96]\nOrganization of Companies Called For \u2014God says, \u201cEnter\nthe cities. Give the inhabitants of these cities the call to prepare for\nthe coming of the Lord.\u201d...\nMany in the cities are still without the light of the gospel message.\nThose who neglect to sound forth the last message of warning will\nin the future suffer deep regret. My message is, \u201cLet companies\nbe organized to enter the cities. Seek proper locations for holding\nmeetings. Circulate our literature. Make earnest efforts to reach\npeople.\u201d\u2014Letter 106, 1910.\nCorps of Workers in Every Large City \u2014In every large city\nthere should be a corps of organized, well-disciplined workers; not\nmerely one or two, but scores should be set to work....\nEach company of workers should be under the direction of a\ncompetent leader, and it should ever be kept before them that they are\nto be missionaries in the highest sense of the term. Such systematic\nlabor, wisely conducted, would produce blessed results.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 300, 301 (1892).\nVaried Talents Needed\u2014The Lord desires that the cities shall\nbe worked by the united efforts of laborers of different capabilities.\nAll are to look to Jesus for direction, not depending on man for\nwisdom, lest they be led astray.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:109\n(1909).\nWell-trained Companies\u2014There should be companies orga-\nnized, and educated most thoroughly to work as nurses, as evan-\ngelists, as ministers, as canvassers, as gospel students, to perfect a\ncharacter after the divine similitude.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n9:171, 172 (1909).\nGeneralship Sets Men to Work\u2014Let every man work who can\nwork. The very best general is not the one who does the most work\nhimself, but one who will obtain the greatest amount of labor from [97]\nothers.\u2014Letter 1, 1883.\n95\nImportance of Prayerful Counseling\nMeeting the Issues With Counsel and Prayer \u2014There must\nbe something ventured, and some risks run by those on the field of\nbattle. They must not in every movement feel that they must receive\norders from headquarters. They must do the best they can under all\ncircumstances, all counseling together with much earnest prayer to\nGod for His wisdom. There must be union of effort.\u2014Letter 14,\n1887.\nFrequent Councils\u2014In connection with the proclamation of\nthe message in large cities, there are many kinds of work to be done\nby laborers with varied gifts. Some are to labor in one way, some in\nanother.... As laborers together with God, they should seek to be in\nharmony with one another. There should be frequent councils, and\nearnest, whole-hearted co-operation. Yet all are to look to Jesus for\nwisdom, not depending upon men alone for direction.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 9:109 (1909).\nBrother Consult With Brother\u2014As workers we need to coun-\nsel together over difficult matters. It is right that brother should\nconsult with brother. And it is our privilege after we have done\nthis, to bow together in prayer and ask for divine wisdom and coun-\nsel. But for one human voice to be a controlling power is a sad\nmistake.\u2014Letter 186, 1907.\nDefects Revealed\u2014In the work of the laborers there should be a\ncounseling together. No one is to strike out on his own independent\njudgment, and work according to his own mind, unless he has a trea-\nsury of his own from which to draw.... I have been shown that the[98]\nmanagement of the work must not be trusted to inexperienced hands.\nThose who have not had breadth of experience are not the ones to\ntake large responsibilities, although they may think themselves qual-\nified to do so. Their brethren may see defects where they themselves\nsee only perfection.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 8, 1885.\nMinisters to Take Time to Pray\u2014I am drawn out to call upon\nour people to make every effort to save souls. We need increased\n96\nImportance of Prayerful Counseling 97\nfaith. The hearts of our church members should be drawn out in\nprayer for those who are preaching the gospel. And ministers must\ntake time to pray for themselves and for the people of God, whom\nthey are appointed to serve.\u2014Letter 49, 1903.\nPrayer Seasons Bring Encouragement \u2014As workers, let us\nseek the Lord together. Of our own selves we can do nothing; but\nthrough Christ we can do all things. God intends that we shall be a\nhelp and blessing to one another, and that we shall be strong in the\nLord and in the power of His might.... God lives and reigns; and He\nwill give us all the help we need. It is our privilege at all times to\ndraw strength and encouragement from His blessed promise, \u201cMy\ngrace is sufficient for you.\u201d\u2014Historical Sketches, p. 129. (1886).\nUnity in Diversity\nGod\u2019s Plan in a Diversity of Gifts\u2014In all the Lord\u2019s arrange-\nments, there is nothing more beautiful than His plan of giving to men\nand women a diversity of gifts. The church is His garden, adorned\nwith a variety of trees, plants, and flowers. He does not expect the[99]\nhyssop to assume the proportions of the cedar, nor the olive to reach\nthe height of the stately palm. Many have received but a limited\nreligious and intellectual training, but God has a work for this class\nto do if they will labor in humility, trusting in Him.\u2014Letter 122,\n1902.\nCharacters as Varied as the Flowers\u2014From the endless vari-\nety of plants and flowers, we may learn an important lesson. All\nblossoms are not the same in form or color. Some possess healing\nvirtues. Some are always fragrant. There are professing Christians\nwho think it their duty to make every Christian like themselves. This\nis man\u2019s plan, not the plan of God. In the church of God there is\nroom for characters as varied as are the flowers in a garden. In\nHis spiritual garden there are many varieties of flowers.\u2014Letter 95,\n1902.\nDiverse in Mind and Ideas \u2014Diverse in mind, in ideas, one\nsubject is to bind heart to heart\u2014the conversion of souls to the truth,\nwhich draws all to the cross.\u2014Letter 31, 1892.\nSpecial Talents for Special Work\u2014One worker may be a ready\nspeaker; another a ready writer; another may have the gift of sincere,\nearnest, fervent prayer; another the gift of singing; another may have\nspecial power to explain the Word of God with clearness. And each\ngift is to become a power for God, because He works with the laborer.\nTo one God gives the word of wisdom, to another knowledge, to\nanother faith; but all are to work under the same Head. The diversity\nof gifts leads to a diversity of operations; but \u201cit is the same God\nwhich worketh all in all.\u201d 1 Corinthians 12:6.\nThe Lord desires His chosen servants to learn how to unite\ntogether in harmonious effort. It may seem to some that the contrast[100]\n98\nUnity in Diversity 99\nbetween their gifts and the gifts of a fellow laborer is too great to\nallow them to unite in harmonious effort; but when they remember\nthat there are varied minds to be reached, and that some will reject\nthe truth as it is presented by one laborer, only to open their hearts\nto God\u2019s truth as it is presented in a different manner by another\nlaborer, they will hopefully endeavor to labor together in unity. Their\ntalents, however diverse, may all be under the control of the same\nSpirit. In every word and act, kindness and love will be revealed;\nand as each worker fills his appointed place faithfully, the prayer of\nChrist for the unity of His followers will be answered, and the world\nwill know that these are His disciples....\nThe workers in the large cities must act their several parts, mak-\ning every effort to bring about the best results. They are to talk faith\nand to act in such a way as to impress the people. They are not\nto narrow the work down to their own particular ideas. In the past\ntoo much of this has been done by us as a people, and it has been\na drawback to the success of the work. Let us remember that the\nLord has different ways of working, that He has different workmen\nto whom He entrusts different gifts.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n9:144-146 (1909).\nSatan\u2019s Efforts to Divide Workers\u2014As we begin active work\nfor the multitudes in the cities, the enemy will work mightily to bring\nin confusion, hoping thus to break up the working forces. Some who\nare not thoroughly converted, are in constant danger of mistaking\nthe suggestions of the enemy as the leadings of the Spirit of God.\nAs the Lord has given us light, let us walk in the light.\u2014Manuscript\n13, 1910.\nBeware of Satan\u2019s Plans\u2014Not all who take hold of the work\nwill be of the same temperament. They will not be men of the [101]\nsame education or training, and they will just as surely work at cross\npurposes as they are different in character, unless they are daily\nconverted men.\nEvery day Satan has his plans to carry out\u2014certain lines that\nwill hedge up the way of those who are witnesses for Jesus Christ.\nNow, unless the living, human agents for Jesus are humble, meek,\nand lowly of heart because they have learned of Jesus, they will just\nas surely fall under temptation as they live; for Satan is watching\nand artful and subtle, and the workers, if not prayerful, will be taken\n100 Evangelism\nunawares. He steals upon them as a thief in the night and makes\nthem captives. Then he works upon the minds of individuals to\npervert their individual ideas and frame their plans; and if brethren\nsee danger and speak of it, they feel that a personal injury is done\nthem, that someone is trying to weaken their influence. One draws\none way, and another in an opposite direction.\nThe work has been bound about, false moves have been made,\nand Satan has been pleased. If self had not been so carefully, ten-\nderly cherished, lest it should not find room enough to preserve its\nnative dignity, the Lord could have used these differently constituted\ncharacters to do a good work and much larger; for in their diversity\nof talent, yet unity in Christ, was the power of their usefulness. If,\nlike the diverse branches of the vine, they were centered in the vine\nstock, all would bear the rich cluster of precious fruit. There would\nbe perfect harmony in their diversity, for they are partakers of the\nnourishment and fitness of the vine.\nThe Lord is displeased with the want of harmony that has existed\namong the workers. He cannot impart His Holy Spirit, for they\nare bent on having their own way, and the Lord presents to them\nHis way. Great discouragement will come in from Satan and his[102]\nconfederacy of evil, but \u201call ye are brethren,\u201d and it is an offense to\nGod when you allow your individual, unsanctified traits of character\nto be active agencies to discourage one another.\u2014Letter 31, 1892.\nPress Together, Press Together\u2014Love of self, pride, and self-\nsufficiency lie at the foundation of the greatest trials and discords\nthat have ever existed in the religious world. Again and again the\nangel has said to me, \u201cPress together, press together, be of one mind,\nof one judgment,\u201d Christ is the leader, and you are brethren; follow\nHim.\u2014Letter 4, 1890.\nStrife for Supremacy\u2014Linked together in confidence, in the\nbonds of holy love, brother may receive from brother all the help\nthat can possibly be obtained from one another....\nStrife for the supremacy makes manifest a spirit that, if cherished,\nwill eventually shut out from the kingdom of God those who cherish\nit. The peace of Christ cannot dwell in the mind and heart of a\nworkman who criticizes and finds fault with another workman simply\nbecause the other does not practice the methods he thinks best,\nor because he feels that he is not appreciated. The Lord never\nUnity in Diversity 101\nblesses him who criticizes and accuses his brethren, for this is Satan\u2019s\nwork.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1894.\nTo Value Gifts of Others \u2014My brethren, try the wearing of\nChrist\u2019s yoke. Come down from your spiritual stilts and practice the\ngrace of humility. Put away every evil surmising and be willing to\nsee the value of the gifts God has bestowed on your brethren.\u2014Letter\n125, 1903.\nDifferent in Temperament, but United in Spirit \u2014In our\nhome we have no dissension, no words of impatience. My workers [103]\nare different in temperament, and their ways and manners are differ-\nent, but we blend in action and stand united in spirit, seeking to help\nand strengthen one another. We know that we cannot afford to be\nat variance because we differ in temperament. We are God\u2019s little\nchildren, and we ask Him to help us to live, not to please ourselves\nand to have our own way, but to please and glorify Him.\u2014Letter\n252, 1903.\nAllowing for More Than One Man\u2019s Method\n[See also pp. 72-74, \u201cAdvantages of Two and Two.\u201d]\nVaried Gifts Combined\u2014In our association with one another\nwe are to remember that all have not the same talents or the same\ndisposition. The workers differ in plans and ideas. Varied gifts,\ncombined, are necessary for the success of the work. Let us re-\nmember that some can fill certain positions more successfully than\nothers. The worker who has been given tact and ability that fit him\nfor the accomplishment of some special line of work should not\nblame others for not being able to do that which he, perhaps, can do\nreadily. Are there not things that his fellow workers can do far more\nsuccessfully than he?\nThe various talents that the Lord has entrusted to His servants\nare essential in His work. The different parts of the work are to be\nbrought together, piece by piece, to make a complete whole. The\nparts of a building are not all the same; neither are they made by\nthe same process. The lines of God\u2019s work are not all the same, and\nneither are they to be carried forward in exactly the same way.\u2014\nLetter 116, 1903.\nInsufficiency of One Man\u2019s Gifts\u2014Let not one man feel that[104]\nhis gift alone is sufficient for the work of God; that he alone can carry\nthrough a series of meetings, and give perfection to the work. His\nmethods may be good, and yet varied gifts are essential; one man\u2019s\nmind is not to mold and fashion the work according to his special\nideas. In order for the work to be built up strong and symmetrical,\nthere is need of varied gifts and different agencies, all under the\nLord\u2019s direction; He will instruct the workers according to their\nseveral ability. Co-operation and unity are essential to a harmonious\nwhole, each laborer doing his God-given work, filling his appropriate\nposition, and supplying the deficiency of another. One worker left\nto labor alone is in danger of thinking that his talent is sufficient to\nmake a complete whole.\n102\nAllowing for More Than One Man\u2019s Method 103\nWhere there is a union of workers, there is opportunity for them\nto consult together, to pray together, to co-operate in labor. None\nshould feel that they cannot link up with their brethren because they\ndo not work in exactly the same line as they themselves do.\u2014Special\nTestimonies, Series A, No. 7, pp. 14, 15. (1874).\nWhere One Weak, Another Strong \u2014The Lord moves upon\nministers who have varied capabilities, that they may feed the flock\nof His heritage with food convenient for them. They will reveal\ntruth on points that their brother laborer did not regard as essential.\nWere the work of ministering to the flock left entirely to one man,\nthere would be deficiency in the results. In His providence the Lord\nsends various workmen. One is strong on some essential point where\nanother is weak.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1894.\nDo Not Block the Wheels\u2014There are some minds which do not\ngrow with the work but allow the work to grow far beyond them.... [105]\nThose who do not discern and adapt themselves to the increasing\ndemands of the work, should not stand blocking the wheels, and\nthus hindering the advancement of others.\u2014Letter 45, 1889.\nMethods to Be Improved\u2014There must be no fixed rules; our\nwork is a progressive work, and there must be room left for methods\nto be improved upon. But under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,\nunity must and will be preserved.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 23,\n1895.\nDifferent Methods From the Past \u2014Means will be devised\nto reach hearts. Some of the methods used in this work will be\ndifferent from the methods used in the work in the past; but let no\none, because of this, block the way by criticism.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 30, 1902.\nNew Life in Old Methods\u2014Men are needed who pray to God\nfor wisdom, and who, under the guidance of God, can put new life\ninto the old methods of labor and can invent new plans and new\nmethods of awakening the interest of church members and reaching\nthe men and women of the world.\u2014Manuscript 117, 1907.\nLimiting Power of God by One-Line Plans\u2014The kind of plan-\nning that would make one man a center and pattern, neither he nor\nany other man can carry out. This is not the way in which the Lord\nworks.... When one man thinks that his mind is to outline the large\nmoves in the work of God, that his abilities are to accomplish the\n104 Evangelism\ngreatest work, he limits the power of God to fulfill His purposes in\nthe earth.\nGod needs men and women who will work in the simplicity of\nChrist to bring the knowledge of truth before those who need its\nconverting power. But when a precise line is laid down which the[106]\nworkers must follow in their efforts to proclaim the message, a limit\nis set to the usefulness of a great number of workers.\u2014Letter 404,\n1907.\nAvoid a Rut\u2014God\u2019s workmen must labor to be many-sided\nmen; that is, to have a breadth of character, not to be one-idea\nmen, stereotyped in one manner of working, getting into a groove,\nand unable to see and sense that their words and their advocacy of\ntruth must vary with the class of people they are among, and the\ncircumstances that they have to meet.\u2014Letter 12, 1887.\nMethod Determined by Class of People\u2014Let us not forget that\ndifferent methods are to be employed to save different ones.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, April 14, 1903.\nYou have a hard field to handle, but the gospel is the power of\nGod. The classes of people you meet with decide for you the way in\nwhich the work should be handled.\u2014Letter 97a, 1901.\nNo Pulling to Pieces Another\u2019s Work \u2014Remember that we\nare laborers together with God. God is the all-powerful, effectual\nmover. His servants are His instruments. They are not to pull apart,\neveryone laboring in accordance with his own ideas. They are to\nlabor in harmony, fitting together in kindly, courteous, brotherly\norder, in love for one another. There is to be no unkind criticism, no\npulling to pieces of another\u2019s work. Together they are to carry the\nwork forward.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 11, 1900.\nA Warning to Workers of Experience\u2014I am bidden to say to\nmy aged brethren, walk humbly with God. Be not accusers of the\nbrethren. You are to do your appointed work under the direction of\nthe God of Israel. The inclination to criticize is the greatest danger[107]\nof many. The brethren whom you are tempted to criticize are called\nto bear responsibilities which you could not possibly carry; but you\ncan be their helpers. You can do great service to the cause if you\nwill, by presenting your experience in the past in connection with\nthe labors of others. The Lord has not given to any of you the work\nof correcting and censuring your brethren....\nAllowing for More Than One Man\u2019s Method 105\nFollow on with your brethren to know the Lord. Sympathize with\nthose who are bearing a heavy load, and encourage them wherever\nyou can. Your voices are to be heard in unity, and not in dissension.\u2014\nLetter 204, 1907.\nThe City Field Training School\nLaying the Foundation for Service \u2014Before a person is pre-\npared to become a teacher of the truth to those who are in darkness,\nhe must become a learner.... Whenever a special effort is to be made\nin an important place, a well-arranged system of labor should be\nestablished, so that those who wish to become colporteurs and can-\nvassers, and those who are adapted to give Bible readings in families,\nmay receive the necessary instruction....\nThere should be connected with our missions, training schools\nfor those who are about to enter the field as laborers. They should feel\nthat they must become as apprentices to learn the trade of laboring for\nthe conversion of souls. The labor in these schools should be varied.\nThe study of the Bible should be made of primary importance, and at\nthe same time there should be a systematic training of the mind and\nmanners, that they may learn to approach people in the best possible\nway. All should learn how to labor with tact and with courtesy, and[108]\nwith the Spirit of Christ.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 14, 1887.\nTraining Workers During Evangelistic Series \u2014A well-bal-\nanced work can be carried on best in the cities when a Bible school\nfor the training of workers is in progress while public meetings are\nbeing held. Connected with this training school or city mission\nshould be experienced laborers of deep spiritual understanding, who\ncan give the Bible workers daily instruction, and who can also unite\nwholeheartedly in the general public effort. And as men and women\nare converted to the truth, those standing at the head of the mis-\nsion should, with much prayer, show these new converts how to\nexperience the power of the truth in their hearts. Such a mission, if\nconducted by those who know how to manage wisely, will be a light\nshining in a dark place.\u2014Gospel Workers, 364, 365\nThe Field School in Action\u2014Brother and Sister Haskell have\nrented a house in one of the best parts of the city, and have gath-\nered round them a family of helpers, who day by day go out giving\nBible readings, selling our papers, and doing medical missionary\n106\nCity Field Training School 107\nwork. During the hour of worship, the workers relate their experi-\nences. Bible studies are regularly conducted in the home, and the\nyoung men and young women connected with the mission receive a\npractical, thorough training in holding Bible readings and in selling\nour publications. The Lord has blessed their labors, a number have\nembraced the truth, and many others are deeply interested....\nA similar work should be done in many cities. The young people\nwho go out to labor in these cities should be under the direction of\nexperienced, consecrated leaders. Let the workers be provided with\na good home, in which they may receive thorough training.\u2014The [109]\nReview and Herald, September 7, 1905.\nIn Association With Experienced Worker \u2014God calls for\nministers, Bible workers, and canvassers. Let our young men and\nyoung women go forth as evangelists and Bible workers, in com-\npany with a worker of experience who can show them how to labor\nsuccessfully.\u2014Manuscript 71, 1903.\nChrist\u2019s Method of Training \u2014In their association with the\nMaster the disciples obtained a practical training for missionary\nwork. They saw how He presented truth, and how He dealt with\nthe perplexing questions that arose in His ministry. They saw His\nministry in healing the sick wherever He went; they heard Him\npreach the gospel to the poor. In our day, from the record of His life,\nall must learn His methods of working.\u2014Letter 208a, 1902.\nProper Training Multiples Efficiency\u2014One worker who has\nbeen trained and educated for the work, who is controlled by the\nSpirit of Christ, will accomplish far more than ten laborers who go\nout deficient in knowledge, and weak in the faith. One who works\nin harmony with the counsel of God, and in unity with the brethren,\nwill be more efficient to do good, than ten will be who do not realize\nthe necessity of depending upon God, and of acting in harmony with\nthe general plan of the work.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 29,\n1888.\nThe Training Center and Follow-Up Work\u2014After the com-\nmunity has been stirred by a well-organized camp meeting, then\nshall the workers pull up stakes and leave to attend another camp\nmeeting and let the work ravel out? I say, Divide the workers and\nhave some take right hold, giving Bible readings, doing colporteur [110]\nwork, selling tracts, etc. Let there be a mission home to prepare\n108 Evangelism\nworkers by educating them in every line of the work. This will not\nleave the work to ravel out. The good impressions the messengers\nof God have made upon hearts and minds will not be lost.\nThis house-to-house labor, searching for souls, hunting for the\nlost sheep, is the most essential work that can be done. Seventy-\nfive souls have been organized into a church in -----. We thank\nGod for this. Fifty of these have embraced the truth since the camp\nmeeting.\u2014Letter 137, 1898.\nReviving and Organizing the Church for Service\nReviving Church Members\u2014The Lord does not now work to\nbring many souls into the truth, because of the church members who\nhave never been converted, and those who were once converted but\nwho have backslidden.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:371 (1900).\nTwenty Souls Instead of One\u2014There is a vast amount of rub-\nbish brought forward by professed believers in Christ, which blocks\nup the way to the cross. Notwithstanding all this, there are some\nwho are so deeply convicted that they will come through every dis-\ncouragement, and will surmount every obstacle in order to gain the\ntruth. But had the believers in the truth purified their minds by obey-\ning it, had they felt the importance of knowledge and refinement\nof manners in Christ\u2019s work, where one soul has been saved there\nmight have been twenty.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:68 (1876).\nFirst Train Church Members \u2014In laboring where there are\nalready some in the faith, the minister should at first seek not so much [111]\nto convert unbelievers, as to train the church members for acceptable\nco-operation. Let him labor for them individually, endeavoring to\narouse them to seek for a deeper experience themselves, and to work\nfor others. When they are prepared to sustain the minister by their\nprayers and labors, greater success will attend his efforts.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 196 (1915).\nClearing the King\u2019s Highway\u2014When a special effort to win\nsouls is put forth by laborers of experience in a community where\nour own people live, there rests upon every believer in that field a\nmost solemn obligation to do all in his power to clear the King\u2019s\nhighway, by putting away every sin that would hinder him from co-\noperating with God and with his brethren.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nDecember 6, 1906.\nCounsel to Churches Where City Efforts Are Held \u2014About\nfour years ago, when Elder Haskell and others were conducting a\nBible training school and evening services in New York City, the\nword of the Lord to the workers there was: \u201cLet the believers living\n109\n110 Evangelism\nnear the place where you are holding meetings, share the burden of\nthe work. They should feel it a duty and a privilege to help make\nthe meetings a success. God is pleased by efforts to set them at\nwork. He desires every church member to labor as His helping hand,\nseeking by loving ministry to win souls to Christ.\u201d...\nAnd to the church in Los Angeles, over a year ago, when the\nLord was mightily stirring the people through the tent meetings in\nprogress, was sent the word: \u201cLet the Los Angeles church have\nspecial seasons of prayer daily for the work that is being done. The\nblessing of the Lord will come to the church members who thus\nparticipate in the work, gathering in small groups daily to pray for[112]\nits success. Thus the believers will obtain grace for themselves, and\nthe work of the Lord will be advanced.\n\u201cThis is the way we used to do. We prayed for our own souls and\nfor those who were carrying on the work. The Lord Jesus declares\nthat where two or three are gathered together in His name, He is in\nthe midst of them, to bless them. Let there be less talking, and more\nsincere, earnest prayer.\n\u201cI fear that the effort that is being made to proclaim the truth in\nLos Angeles will not be appreciated. Let every man come up to the\nhelp of the Lord against the mighty foe. Where a special effort is\nmade, as has been revealed by the evangelistic work done in Los\nAngeles, let every member of the church draw near to God. Let all\nsearch their own hearts with the light that shines from the Word.\nIf sin is discovered, let it be confessed and repented of. Let every\nhelper be in good working order. The Lord will hear and answer\nprayer. Let not the church members think that efforts should be put\nforth for them by the one who is impressed to labor for those who\nhave been neglected, those in whose behalf special efforts have not\nheretofore been put forth.\nWhere such an effort is made as has been made in Los Angeles,\nlet the members of the church clear the King\u2019s highway, and help\nwith their means in the work being done. Let them show that they\nare in perfect harmony. Let them be on hand at the meetings, armed\nand equipped for service, ready to talk with anyone who may be\ninterested. Let them pray and work for the lost sheep.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, December 20, 1906.\nReviving and Organizing the Church for Service 111\nAn Example to New Converts\u2014Let the older members be an\nexample to those who have recently come into the truth. I entreat [113]\nthose who have been long in the truth not to hurt the new converts\nby living irreligious lives. Lay aside all murmuring and do thorough\nwork in your own hearts. Break up the fallow ground of your hearts\nand seek to know what you can do to advance the work....\nAwake, awake, and give to the unconverted evidence that you\nbelieve the truth of heavenly origin. Unless you do awake, the\nworld will not believe that you practice the truth that you profess to\nhold.\u2014Letter 75, 1905.\nThe Church Members to Help \u2014The Lord requires that far\ngreater personal effort shall be put forth by the members of our\nchurches. Souls have been neglected, towns and villages and cities\nhave not heard the truth for this time, because wise missionary efforts\nhave not been made.... Our ordained ministers must do what they\ncan, but it must not be expected that one man can do the work of\nall. The Master has appointed unto every man his work. There are\nvisits to be made, there is praying to be done, there is sympathy\nto be imparted; and the piety\u2014the heart and hand\u2014of the whole\nchurch is to be employed if the work is to be accomplished. You can\nsit down with your friends, and in a pleasant, social way, talk of the\nprecious Bible faith.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 13, 1889.\nMinisters Enlist Churches in Evangelism \u2014Sometimes min-\nisters do too much; they seek to embrace the whole work in their\narms. It absorbs and dwarfs them; yet they continue to grasp it all.\nThey seem to think that they alone are to work in the cause of God,\nwhile the members of the church stand idle. This is not God\u2019s order\nat all.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 18, 1884.\nA Working Force Augmented by Laymen \u2014How can our [114]\nbrethren and sisters continue to live close to large numbers of people\nwho have never been warned, without devising methods of set-\nting to work every agency through whom the Lord can work to the\nglory of His name? Our leaders who have had long experience will\nunderstand the importance of these matters, and can do much to\nincrease the working forces. They can plan to reach many in the\nhighways and in the hedges. As they put forth calm, steady, devoted\neffort to educate the church members to engage in personal work for\n112 Evangelism\nsouls wherever there are favorable openings, success will mark their\nlabors.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1910.\nThe Fields in Your Neighborhood Are Ripe\u2014The truth will\ntriumph gloriously. Let the churches begin to do the work that the\nLord has given them\u2014the work of opening the Scriptures to those\nwho are in darkness. My brethren and sisters, there are souls in your\nneighborhood who, if they were judiciously labored for, would be\nconverted. Efforts must be made for those who do not understand the\nWord. Let those who profess to believe the truth become partakers\nof the divine nature, and then they will see that the fields are ripe\nfor the work that all can do whose souls are prepared by living the\nWord.\u2014(Australasian) Union Conference Record, March 11, 1907.\nDistributing Literature From Door to Door \u2014Brethren and\nsisters, will you put on the Christian armor? \u201cYour feet shod with\nthe preparation of the gospel of peace,\u201d you will be prepared to walk\nfrom house to house, carrying the truth to the people. Sometimes\nyou will find it trying to do this kind of work; but if you go forth\nin faith, the Lord will go before you, and will let His light shine\nupon your pathway. Entering the homes of your neighbors to sell or[115]\nto give away our literature, and in humility to teach them the truth,\nyou will be accompanied by the light of heaven, which will abide in\nthese homes.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 24, 1906.\nOrganizing Into Working Bands\u2014In our churches let compa-\nnies be formed for service. In the Lord\u2019s work there are to be no\nidlers. Let different ones unite in labor as fishers of men. Let them\nseek to gather souls from the corruption of the world into the saving\npurity of Christ\u2019s love.\nThe formation of small companies as a basis of Christian effort\nis a plan that has been presented before me by One who cannot err.\nIf there is a large number in the church, let the members be formed\ninto small companies, to work not only for the church members\nbut for unbelievers also.\u2014(Australasian) Union Conference Record,\nAugust 15, 1902.\nLike a Well-drilled Company of Soldiers\u2014Ministers should\nlove order, and should discipline themselves, and then they can\nsuccessfully discipline the church of God and teach them to work\nharmoniously, like a well-drilled company of soldiers. If discipline\nand order are necessary for successful action on the battlefield, the\nReviving and Organizing the Church for Service 113\nsame are as much more needful in the warfare in which we are\nengaged as the object to be gained is of greater value and more\nelevated in character than those for which opposing forces contend\non the field of battle. In the conflict in which we are engaged eternal\ninterests are at stake.\nAngels work harmoniously. Perfect order characterizes all their\nmovements. The more closely we imitate the harmony and order\nof the angelic host, the more successful will be the efforts of these\nheavenly agents in our behalf.\u2014Letter 32, 1892.\nRelationship of Evangelist and Pastor[116]\nEvangelists and Pastors Needed \u2014God calls for evangelists.\nA true evangelist is a lover of souls. He hunts and fishes for men.\nPastors are needed [See also pp. 345-351, \u201cPastoral Evangelism.\u201d]\u2014\nfaithful shepherds\u2014who will not flatter God\u2019s people or treat them\nharshly, but who will feed them with the bread of life.\nThe work of every faithful laborer lies close to the heart of Him\nwho gave Himself for the redemption of the race.\u2014Letter 21, 1903.\nEvangelist-Pastor\u2014One man usually performs the labor which\nshould be shared by two; for the work of the evangelist is necessarily\ncombined with that of the pastor, bringing a double burden upon the\nworker in the field.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:260 (1876).\nConfidence in the New Laborer\u2014Let not the laborer be fearful\nthat because a new laborer is introduced to the people the interest\nwill be interrupted and the work in which he is engaged will be\nmarred.\nKeep your hands off the ark; God will take care of His work.\nAdditional light will flash forth from the men who are sent of God,\nwho are laborers together with God, and the original workers should\nreceive God\u2019s messengers cordially, treat them respectfully, and\ninvite them to unite with them and speak to the people.\u2014Manuscript\n21, 1894.\n114\nGuarding Against Overorganization\nMotion Not Necessarily Life\u2014It is not orthodox theories, not\nmembership in the church, not the diligent performance of a certain [117]\nround of duties, that gives evidence of life. In an ancient tower in\nSwitzerland I saw the image of a man that moved as if it possessed\nlife. It looked like a living man, and I whispered when I came near,\nas if it could hear me. But though the image looked like life, it had\nno real life. It was moved by machinery.\nMotion is not necessarily life. We may go through all the forms\nand ceremonies of religion; but unless we are alive in Christ, our\nwork is worthless. The Lord calls for living, working, believing\nChristians.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 21, 1903.\nWork Made Difficult by Useless Inventions\u2014Men make the\nwork of advancing the truth tenfold harder than it really is, by seeking\nto take God\u2019s work out of His hands into their own finite hands. They\nthink they must be constantly inventing something to make men do\nthings which they suppose these persons ought to do. The time thus\nspent is all the while making the work more complicated; for the\nGreat Chief Worker is left out of the question in the care of His\nown heritage. Men undertake the job of tinkering up the defective\ncharacters, and only succeed in making the defects much worse.\nThey would better leave God to do His own work, for He does not\nregard them as capable of reshaping character....\nInstead of toiling to prepare set rules and regulations, you might\nbetter be praying and submitting your own will and your ways to\nChrist. He is not pleased when you make hard the thing He has\nmade easy. He says, \u201cTake My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for\nI am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\nFor My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d The Lord Jesus loves\nHis heritage, and if men will not think it their special prerogative to [118]\nprescribe rules for their fellow laborers, but will bring Christ\u2019s rules\ninto their life and copy His lessons, then each will be an example,\nand not a judge.\u2014Manuscript 44, 1894.\n115\n116 Evangelism\nContrary to Human Planning\u2014Unless those who can help in\n_____ are aroused to a sense of their duty, they will not recognize\nthe work of God when the loud cry of the third angel shall be heard.\nWhen light goes forth to lighten the earth, instead of coming up to\nthe help of the Lord, they will want to bind about His work to meet\ntheir narrow ideas. Let me tell you that the Lord will work in this\nlast work in a manner very much out of the common order of things,\nand in a way that will be contrary to any human planning. There will\nbe those among us who will always want to control the work of God,\nto dictate even what movements shall be made when the work goes\nforward under the direction of the angel who joins the third angel in\nthe message to be given to the world. God will use ways and means\nby which it will be seen that He is taking the reins in His own hands.\nThe workers will be surprised by the simple means that He will use\nto bring about and perfect His work of righteousness.\u2014Testimonies\nto Ministers and Gospel Workers, 300 (1885).\nSection 6\u2014The Public Effort [119]\nOur Present Truth Message\nReaching Large Congregations\u2014We should make efforts to\ncall together large congregations to hear the words of the gospel\nminister. And those who preach the Word of the Lord should speak\nthe truth. They should bring their hearers, as it were, to the foot of\nSinai, to listen to the words spoken by God amid scenes of awful\ngrandeur.\u2014Letter 187, 1903.\nGive the Trumpet a Certain Sound\u2014Those who present the\ntruth are to enter into no controversy. They are to preach the gospel\nwith such faith and earnestness that an interest will be awakened. By\nthe words they speak, the prayers they offer, the influence they exert,\nthey are to sow seeds that will bear fruit to the glory of God. There\nis to be no wavering. The trumpet is to give a certain sound. The\nattention of the people is to be called to the third angel\u2019s message.\nLet not God\u2019s servants act like men walking in their sleep, but like\nmen preparing for the coming of Christ.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMarch 2, 1905.\nProclamation of Truth Our Work\u2014In a special sense Seventh-\nday Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light-\nbearers. To them has been entrusted the last warning for a perishing\nworld. On them is shining wonderful light from the Word of God.\nThey have been given a work of the most solemn import,\u2014the\nproclamation of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. There[120]\nis no other work of so great importance. They are to allow nothing\nelse to absorb their attention.\nThe most solemn truths ever entrusted to mortals have been given\nus to proclaim to the world. The proclamation of these truths is to\nbe our work. The world is to be warned, and God\u2019s people are to be\ntrue to the trust committed to them....\nShall we wait until God\u2019s judgments fall upon the transgressor\nbefore we tell him how to avoid them? Where is our faith in the\nWord of God? Must we see things foretold come to pass before we\nwill believe what He has said? In clear, distinct rays light has come\n118\nOur Present Truth Message 119\nto us, showing us that the great day of the Lord is near at hand, \u201ceven\nat the door.\u201d\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:19, 20 (1909).\nNot to Miss the Mark\u2014There must be no time uselessly em-\nployed in this great work. We must not miss the mark. Time is too\nshort for us to undertake to reveal all that might be opened up to\nview. Eternity will be required that we may know all the length and\nbreadth, the height and depth, of the Scriptures....\nTo the apostle John, on the Isle of Patmos, were revealed the\nthings that God desired him to give to the people. Study these\nrevelations. Here are themes worthy of our contemplation, large\nand comprehensive lessons, which all the angelic hosts are now\nseeking to communicate. Behold the life and character of Christ,\nand study His mediatorial work. Here are infinite wisdom, infinite\nlove, infinite justice, infinite mercy. Here are depths and heights,\nlengths and breadths, for our consideration. Numberless pens have\nbeen employed in presenting to the world the life, the character,\nand the mediatorial work of Christ; yet every mind through whom\nthe Holy Spirit has worked has presented these themes in a light [121]\nthat is fresh and new, according to the mind and spirit of the human\nagent....\nWe want the truth as it is in Jesus; for we desire to make the peo-\nple understand what Christ is to them, and what the responsibilities\nare that they are called upon to accept in Him. As His representatives\nand witnesses, we need to come to a full understanding of the saving\ntruths attained by an experimental knowledge.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, April 4, 1899.\nEmphasize Special Truths\u2014We are under obligation to declare\nfaithfully the whole counsel of God. We are not to make less promi-\nnent the special truths that have separated us from the world, and\nmade us what we are; for they are fraught with eternal interests.\nGod has given us light in regard to the things that are now taking\nplace in the last remnant of time, and with pen and voice we are to\nproclaim the truth to the world, not in a tame, spiritless way, but\nin demonstration of the Spirit and power of God.\u2014Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 470 (1890).\nA Seventh-day Adventist Message\u2014At this time, when we are\nso near the end, shall we become so like the world in practice that\nmen may look in vain to find God\u2019s denominated people? Shall\n120 Evangelism\nany man sell our peculiar characteristics as God\u2019s chosen people for\nany advantage the world has to give? Shall the favor of those who\ntransgress the law of God be looked upon as of great value? Shall\nthose whom the Lord has named His people suppose that there is\nany power higher than the great I AM? Shall we endeavor to blot\nout the distinguishing points of faith that have made us Seventh-day\nAdventists?\nOur only safety is in standing constantly in the light of God\u2019s\ncountenance.\u2014Manuscript 84, 1905.\nA Cheerful Present-Truth Message\u2014Now, just now, we are[122]\nto proclaim present truth, with assurance and with power. Do not\nstrike one dolorous note; do not sing funeral hymns.\u2014Letter 311,\n1905.\nConvinced by the Weight of Evidence\u2014God is presenting to\nthe minds of men divinely appointed precious gems of truth, appro-\npriate for our time. God has rescued these truths from the compan-\nionship of error, and has placed them in their proper frame-work.\nWhen these truths are given their rightful position in God\u2019s great\nplan, when they are presented intelligently and earnestly, and with\nreverential awe, by the Lord\u2019s servants, many will conscientiously\nbelieve because of the weight of evidence, without waiting for every\nsupposed difficulty which may suggest itself to their minds, to be\nremoved.\u2014Manuscript 8a, 1888.\nArresting Public Attention\nBy Extraordinary Methods\u2014In the cities of today, where there\nis so much to attract and please, the people can be interested by\nno ordinary efforts. Ministers of God\u2019s appointment will find it\nnecessary to put forth extraordinary efforts in order to arrest the\nattention of the multitudes. And when they succeed in bringing\ntogether a large number of people, they must bear messages of a\ncharacter so out of the usual order that the people will be aroused\nand warned. They must make use of every means that can possibly\nbe devised for causing the truth to stand out clearly and distinctly.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 9:109 (1909).\nDevise New and Unusual Plans\u2014Let every worker in the Mas-\nter\u2019s vineyard, study, plan, devise methods, to reach the people [123]\nwhere they are. We must do something out of the common course of\nthings. We must arrest the attention. We must be deadly in earnest.\nWe are on the very verge of times of trouble and perplexities that are\nscarcely dreamed of.\u2014Letter 20, 1893.\nChrist Used Various Methods\u2014From Christ\u2019s methods of la-\nbor we may learn many valuable lessons. He did not follow merely\none method; in various ways He sought to gain the attention of\nthe multitude; and then He proclaimed to them the truths of the\ngospel.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 17, 1907.\nSimple Sincerity Attracted Large Numbers \u2014His messages\nof mercy were varied to suit His audience. He knew \u201chow to speak\na word in season to him that is weary\u201d; for grace was poured upon\nHis lips, that He might convey to men in the most attractive way the\ntreasures of truth. He had tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and\nsurprise them with illustrations that won their attention. Through\nthe imagination He reached the heart. His illustrations were taken\nfrom the things of daily life, and although they were simple, they\nhad in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The birds of the air, the\nlilies of the field, the seed, the shepherd and the sheep,\u2014with these\nobjects Christ illustrated immortal truth; and ever afterward, when\n121\n122 Evangelism\nHis hearers chanced to see these things of nature, they recalled His\nwords. Christ\u2019s illustrations constantly repeated His lessons.\nChrist never flattered men. He never spoke that which would\nexalt their fancies and imaginations, nor did He praise them for\ntheir clever inventions; but deep, unprejudiced thinkers received His\nteaching, and found that it tested their wisdom. They marveled at the\nspiritual truth expressed in the simplest language. The most highly[124]\neducated were charmed with His words, and the uneducated were\nalways profited. He had a message for the illiterate; and He made\neven the heathen to understand that He had a message for them.\nHis tender compassion fell with a touch of healing upon weary\nand troubled hearts. Even amid the turbulence of angry enemies\nHe was surrounded with an atmosphere of peace. The beauty of\nHis countenance, the loveliness of His character, above all, the love\nexpressed in look and tone, drew to Him all who were not hardened\nin unbelief. Had it not been for the sweet, sympathetic spirit that\nshone out in every look and word, He would not have attracted the\nlarge congregations that He did. The afflicted ones who came to\nHim, felt that He linked His interest with theirs as a faithful and\ntender friend, and they desired to know more of the truths He taught.\nHeaven was brought near. They longed to abide in His presence,\nthat the comfort of His love might be with them continually.\u2014The\nDesire of Ages, 254 (1898).\nAttracting and Holding Large Numbers \u2014Those who will\nstudy the manner of Christ\u2019s teaching, and educate themselves to\nfollow His way, will attract and hold large numbers now, as Christ\nheld the people in His day.... When the truth in its practical charac-\nter is urged upon the people because you love them, souls will be\nconvicted, because the Holy Spirit of God will impress their hearts.\nArm yourselves with humility; pray that angels of God may\ncome close to your side to impress the mind; for it is not you that\nwork the Holy Spirit, but the Holy Spirit must work you. It is the\nHoly Spirit that makes the truth impressive. Keep practical truth\never before the people.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:57 (1900).\nAdvantage of Surprise Approach in Some Places\u2014Light was[125]\ngiven me by the Lord that it was not the best plan to make a display\nof what we were going to do; for just as soon as our intentions\nwere made known, our enemies would be roused to block the way.\nArresting Public Attention 123\nMinisters would be called into the field to resist the message of truth.\nWarnings from the pulpit would be given to the congregations, ...\ntelling them the things that the Adventists designed to do.\nFrom the light given me by the Lord, I have a warning to present\nto our brethren. Do not wise generals keep their movements strictly\nsecret, lest the enemy shall learn their plans, and work to counteract\nthem? If the enemy has no knowledge of their movements, they have\nan advantage.\nWe are to study the field carefully and are not to think that we\nmust follow the same methods in every place. If we move wisely,\nwithout one tinge of boasting, without stopping to challenge the\nenemy, if we advance one line of truth after another, crowding in the\nmost important and soul-testing [truths], the Lord will take care of\nthe result....\nWait; pitch the tents when the time for camp meeting comes. Put\nthem up rapidly, and then give notice of the meetings. Whatever may\nhave been your former practice, it is not necessary to repeat it again\nand again in the same way. God would have new and untried methods\nfollowed. Break in upon the people\u2014surprise them.\u2014Manuscript\n121, 1897.\nTactful Methods, Not Deception\u2014You need not feel that all\nthe truth is to be spoken to unbelievers on any and every occasion.\nYou should plan carefully what to say and what to leave unsaid. This\nis not practicing deception; it is to work as Paul worked. He says,\n\u201cBeing crafty, I caught you with guile.\u201d You must vary your labor, [126]\nand not have one way which you think must be followed at all times\nand in all places. Your ways may seem to you a success, but if you\nused more tact, more of the wisdom of the serpent, you would have\nseen much more real results of your work.\u2014Letter 12, 1887.\nPoor Hall Advertises Defeat\u2014I am convinced that we might\nhave had a good hearing if our brethren had secured a suitable hall\nto accommodate the people. But they did not expect much, and\ntherefore did not receive much. We cannot expect people to come\nout to hear unpopular truth when the meetings are advertised to be\nheld in a basement, or in a small hall that will seat only a hundred\npersons.... By their lack of faith our laborers sometimes make the\nwork very hard for themselves.\u2014Historical Sketches, p. 200. (1886).\n124 Evangelism\nIn God\u2019s Own Way\u2014It is not by outward display that men and\nwomen are to learn what is comprehended by present truth. Our\nworkers are to practice strict economy. God forbids all extravagance.\nEvery dollar at our command is to be expended with economy. No\ngreat display is to be made. God\u2019s money is to be used to carry\nforward in His own way the work that He has declared must be done\nin our world.\u2014Letter 107, 1905.\nDisplay Is Poor Advertising\u2014The large cities are to be warned,\nbut, my brother, not all the methods that you follow in this work are\nright. You think that you are at liberty to spend all the money that\nyou please to gain the attention of the people. But remember that in\nthe Lord\u2019s vineyard there are many, many places to be worked, and\nthat every dollar is needed.\nGod is not pleased by your large outlay of means to advertise[127]\nyour meetings, and by the display made in other features of your\nwork. The display is out of harmony with the principles of the Word\nof God. He is dishonored by your expensive preparations. At times\nyou do that which is represented to me as the shredding of wild\ngourds into the pot. This display makes the truth taste too strongly\nof the dish. Man is exalted. The truth is not advanced, but hindered.\nSensible men and women can see that the theatrical performances\nare not in harmony with the solemn message that you bear.\u2014Letter\n190, 1902.\nDisappointing Results From Expensive Methods\u2014Cut down\nthe expense of advertising your meetings, and if a large amount\nof money is given in the collections made at the meeting, use this\nmoney to carry on your efforts in new places.\nDo not hire worldly musicians if this can possibly be avoided.\nGather together singers who will sing with the spirit and with the\nunderstanding also. The extra display which you sometimes make\nentails unnecessary expense, which the brethren should not be asked\nto meet; and you will find that after a time unbelievers will not be\nwilling to give money to meet these expenses....\nI beg of you not to continue to follow such expensive methods of\nlabor. I must tell you that the Lord does not endorse these methods.\nAnd they do not accomplish what you suppose they do.\u2014Letter 51,\n1902.\nArresting Public Attention 125\nMust Depend on God \u2014There is far more being done by the\nuniverse of Heaven than we have any idea of, in preparing the way\nso that souls shall be converted. We want to work in harmony with\nthe messengers of Heaven. We want more of God; we do not want to [128]\nfeel that it is our talking and our sermonizing that is to do the work;\nwe want to feel that unless the people are reached through God, they\nnever will be reached.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nStudy Method of Approach \u2014The work of winning souls to\nChrist demands careful preparation. Man cannot enter the Lord\u2019s\nservice without the needed training, and expect the highest success....\nThe architect will tell you how long it took him to understand how to\nplan a tasteful, commodious building. And so it is in all the callings\nthat men follow. Should the servants of Christ show less diligence\nin preparing for work infinitely more important? Should they be\nignorant of the ways and means to be employed in winning souls? It\nrequires a knowledge of human nature, close study, careful thought,\nand earnest prayer, to know how to approach men and women on the\ngreat subjects that concern their eternal welfare.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n92 (1915).\nSuccessful and Impressive Advertising Methods\nOur Work Judged by Our Advertising \u2014The character and\nimportance of our work are judged by the efforts made to bring it\nbefore the public. When these efforts are so limited, the impression\nis given that the message we present is not worthy of notice.\u2014\nHistorical Sketches, p. 200. (1886).\nJudicious Advertising\u2014There is a necessity, it is true, for ex-\npending money judiciously in advertising the meetings, and in carry-\ning forward the work solidly. Yet the strength of every worker will be\nfound to lie, not in these outward agencies, but in trustful dependence[129]\nupon God, in earnest prayer to Him for help, in obedience to His\nWord.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:110 (1909).\nDevising Methods to Reach the People \u2014Workers with clear\nminds are needed to devise methods for reaching the people. Some-\nthing must be done to break down the prejudice existing in the world\nagainst the truth.\u2014Letter 152, 1901.\nArticles in Secular Papers \u2014Men will misrepresent the doc-\ntrines we believe and teach as Bible truth, and it is necessary that\nwise plans should be laid to secure the privilege of inserting articles\ninto the secular papers; for this will be a means of awakening souls\nto see the truth. God will raise up men who will be qualified to sow\nbeside all waters. God has given great light upon important truths,\nand it must come to the world.\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\nUnique Advertising for Business People\u2014With intense inter-\nest God is looking on this world. He has noted the capacity of\nhuman beings for service. Looking down the ages, He has counted\nHis workers, both men and women, and has prepared the way before\nthem, saying, \u201cI will send My messengers to them, and they shall see\ngreat light shining amid the darkness. Won to the service of Christ,\nthey will use their talents to the glory of My name. They will go\nforth to work for Me with zeal and devotion. Through their efforts\nthe truth will speak to thousands in a most forcible manner, and men\nspiritually blind will receive sight, and will see My salvation.\n126\nSuccessful and Impressive Advertising Methods 127\nTruth will be made so prominent that he who runs may read.\nMeans will be devised to reach hearts. Some of the methods used in\nthis work will be different from the methods used in the work in the\npast; but let no one, because of this, block the way by criticism.\u2014 [130]\nThe Review and Herald, September 30, 1902.\nUtilizing the Press\u2014We must take every justifiable means of\nbringing the light before the people. Let the press be utilized, and let\nevery advertising agency be employed that will call attention to the\nwork. This should not be regarded as nonessential. On every street\ncorner you may see placards and notices calling attention to various\nthings that are going on, some of them of the most objectionable\ncharacter; and shall those who have the light of life be satisfied with\nfeeble efforts to call the attention of the masses to the truth?\nThose who become interested have to meet sophistry and mis-\nrepresentation from popular ministers, and they know not how to\nanswer these things. The truth presented by the living preacher\nshould be published in as compact a form as possible, and circulated\nwidely. As far as practicable, let the important discourses given at\nour camp meetings be published in the newspapers. Thus the truth\nwhich was placed before a limited number may find access to many\nminds. And where the truth has been misrepresented, the people\nwill have an opportunity of knowing just what the minister said.\nPut your light on a candlestick, that it may give light to all who\nare in the house. If the truth has been given to us, we are to make\nit so plain to others that the honest in heart may recognize it and\nrejoice in its bright rays.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:36, 37\n(1900).\nAvoiding Excitement and Alarm \u2014I was not favorably im-\npressed with the startling notices of your meetings. They savor\nof fanaticism.... Do not issue notices so worded as to create an\nalarm. When the Lord is ready for the advanced denunciation of\nwicked cities, He will let His people know. But this will be after [131]\nthese wicked cities have had an opportunity to hear the word and to\nreceive the word that is unto life eternal.\nOur work now is to enlighten and educate minds as to the sayings\nof the Scripture. Doors are now opened for the entrance of truth.\nAvail yourselves of the opportunity to reach those who have never\nheard the truth. Explain the truth, as did Christ, in many ways, by\n128 Evangelism\nfigures and parables. And Elder _____\u2019s striking presentation of the\ntruth by the means of charts may be followed to advantage. Let these\nthings speak to the senses of the people. Do not encourage anything\nlike a fanatical movement. Satan works in this line, seeking to draw\naway disciples after him by representations that, if it were possible,\nwill deceive the very elect.\u2014Letter 17, 1902.\nStartling Notices \u2014Startling notices are detrimental to the\nprogress of the work.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 5, 1906.\nI assure you that we are praying for you and for the work in New\nYork City. But please do withdraw those startling notices of your\nmeetings. If a fanatical wave should strike New York now, Satan\nwould work upon human minds, setting in operation a work that\nnone of you are prepared to handle. It is not excitement that we need\nat this time, but calm, steady, devoted effort for the education of the\npeople.\u2014Letter 17, 1902.\nThe Evangelist in Publicity\nBoasting Out of Place \u2014All boasting of merit in ourselves is\nout of place.... Not in our learning, not in our position, not in our\nnumbers or entrusted talents, not in the will of man, is to be found [132]\nthe secret of success.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 401, 404 (1900).\nNot After the World\u2019s Manner \u2014We are not to make the\nworld\u2019s manner of dealing ours. We are to give to the world a\nnobler example, showing that our faith is of a high and elevated\ncharacter.... Therefore, all odd notions and individual peculiarities\nand narrow plans that would give false impressions of the greatness\nof the work, should be avoided.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nNo Misrepresentation to Gain Favor\u2014We are not to misrepre-\nsent what we profess to believe in order to gain favor. God despises\nmisrepresentation and prevarication. He will not tolerate the man\nwho says and does not. The best and noblest work is done by fair,\nhonest dealing.\u2014Letter 232, 1899.\nChrist Not Called Professor \u2014It is not the seeking to climb\nto eminence that will make you great in God\u2019s sight, but it is the\nhumble life of goodness, meekness, fidelity, and purity that will\nmake you the object of the heavenly angels\u2019 special guardianship.\nThe pattern Man, who thought it not robbery to be equal with God,\ntook upon Himself our nature and lived nearly thirty years in an\nobscure Galilean town, hidden among the hills. All the angel host\nwas at His command; yet He did not claim to be anything great or\nexalted. He did not attach \u201cProfessor\u201d to His name to please Himself.\nHe was a carpenter, working for wages, a servant to those for whom\nHe labored.\u2014Letter 1, 1880.\nChrist Reproved Their Vanity \u2014He ... reproved the vanity\nshown in coveting the title of rabbi, or master. Such a title, He\ndeclared, belonged not to men, but to Christ. Priests, scribes, and [133]\nrulers, expounders and administrators of the law, were all brethren,\nchildren of one Father. Jesus impressed upon the people that they\n129\n130 Evangelism\nwere to give no man a title of honor indicating his control of their\nconscience or their faith.\nIf Christ were on earth today, surrounded by those who bear\nthe title of \u201cReverend\u201d or \u201cRight Reverend,\u201d would He not repeat\nHis saying, \u201cNeither be ye called masters; for one is your Master,\neven Christ\u201d? The Scripture declares of God, \u201cHoly and reverend\nis His name.\u201d Psalm 111:9. To what human being is such a title\nbefitting?\u2014The Desire of Ages, 613 (1898).\nNo Right to the Title \u201cReverend\u201d\u2014There must be no lowering\nof the standard as to what constitutes true education. It must be raised\nfar above where it now stands. It is not men whom we are to exalt\nand worship; it is God, the only true and living God, to whom our\nworship and reverence are due.\nAccording to the teaching of the Scriptures, it dishonors God to\naddress ministers as \u201cReverend.\u201d No mortal has any right to attach\nthis to his own name or to the name of any other human being. It\nbelongs only to God, to distinguish Him from every other being.\nThose who lay claim to this title take to themselves God\u2019s holy\nhonor. They have no right to the stolen word, whatever their position\nmay be. \u201cHoly and reverend is His name.\u201d We dishonor God when\nwe use this word where it does not belong.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor,\nJuly 7, 1898.\nLittle Men Handling Great Subjects \u2014The ministers of the\ngospel are to present truth in its simplicity, through the blessing of\nGod making the Scriptures profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for[134]\ncorrection, for instruction in righteousness. \u201cRightly dividing the\nword of truth\u201d\u2014this is the word that should be spoken of all our\nministers.\nBut far, far from this, many of the ministers have departed from\nChrist\u2019s plans. The praise of men is coveted, and they strain ev-\nery faculty in an effort to hunt out and present wonderful things.\nThe Lord bids me counsel them to walk humbly and prayerfully\nwith Him.... Be willing to be little men handling great subjects.\u2014\nManuscript 62, 1905.\nNone Remarkable Men\u2014We have no great men among us, and\nnone need try to make themselves what they are not, remarkable men.\nIt is not wisdom for a single individual to strike out as though he had\nEvangelist in Publicity 131\nsome great talent, as though he were a Moody or a Sankey.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, December 8, 1885.\nThe Message, Not the Man \u2014The minister who has learned\nof Christ will ever be conscious that he is a messenger of God,\ncommissioned by Him to do a work both for time and eternity. It\nshould not be any part of his object to call attention to himself,\nhis learning, or his ability. But his whole aim should be to bring\nsinners to repentance, pointing them, both by precept and example,\nto the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world. Self\nshould be hidden in Jesus. Such men will speak as those conscious\nof possessing power and authority from God, being a mouthpiece\nfor Him. Their discourses will have an earnestness and fervor of\npersuasion that will lead sinners to see their lost condition, and take\nrefuge in Christ.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 8, 1878.\nJohn Only a Voice\u2014Looking in faith to the Redeemer, John\nhad risen to the height of self-abnegation. He sought not to attract [135]\nmen to himself, but to lift their thoughts higher and still higher, until\nthey should rest upon the Lamb of God. He himself had been only a\nvoice, a cry in the wilderness.\u2014Gospel Workers, 56 (1915).\nMen Like John Chosen Today \u2014To fill a high place before\nmen, Heaven chooses the worker who, like John the Baptist, takes\na lowly place before God. The most childlike disciple is the most\nefficient in labor for God. The heavenly intelligences can co-operate\nwith him who is seeking, not to exalt self, but to save souls.\u2014The\nDesire of Ages, 436 (1898).\nWork Marred by Self-glorification \u2014There is no religion in\nthe enthronement of self. He who makes self-glorification his aim,\nwill find himself destitute of that grace which alone can make him\nefficient in Christ\u2019s service. Whenever pride and self-complacency\nare indulged, the work is marred.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 402\n(1900).\nThe True Measure of a Man\u2014Christian worth does not depend\non brilliant talents, lofty birth, wonderful powers, but on a clean\nheart\u2014a heart purified and refined, that does not exalt self, but, by\nbeholding Christ, reflects the long lost image of divinity.\u2014Letter 16,\n1902.\nJesus Only\u2014Resolutely refusing to display human wisdom or\nto exalt self, they [God\u2019s ministers] will accomplish a work that will\n132 Evangelism\nwithstand the assaults of Satan. Many souls will be turned from\ndarkness to light, and many churches will be established. Men will\nbe converted, not to the human instrumentality, but to Christ. Self\nwill be kept in the background; Jesus only, the Man of Calvary, will\nappear.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles, 278 (1911).\nAvoiding Display and the Sensational [136]\nSuccess Not Dependent on Outward Display \u2014Some minis-\nters make the mistake of supposing that success depends on drawing\na large congregation by outward display, and then delivering the\nmessage of truth in a theatrical style. But this is using common fire\ninstead of the sacred fire of God\u2019s kindling. The Lord is not glorified\nby this manner of working. Not by startling notices and expensive\ndisplay is His work to be carried to completion, but by following\nChristlike methods. \u201cNot by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit,\nsaith the Lord of hosts.\u201d It is the naked truth which, like a sharp,\ntwo-edged sword, cuts both ways, arousing to spiritual life those\nwho are dead in trespasses and sins. Men will recognize the gospel\nwhen it is brought to them in a way that is in harmony with God\u2019s\npurposes.\u2014Gospel Workers, 383 (1915).\nMethods of Sound Sense\u2014There are persons that are ready to\ncatch at something strange, which they can bring as a surprise upon\nthe people, to awaken their fears and begin a strange work that will\nspoil the good work that has been begun right....\nThose who are handling the great, grand, ennobling truths of the\nWord must ever reveal a spirit deep, earnest, fervent, but calm, and\nfull of sound sense, that the mouths of gainsayers may be stopped.\nEncourage not a wave of fanaticism that will spoil a work begun as\nit should be, and carried on with the Word of God in your hands....\nThose engaged in the work in New York are not to suppose that\nsome strange thing must be brought in and mingled with their labor,\nas evidence of the supernatural character of the work, setting on it the [137]\nseal that it is of God. Their work is to speak to the people in humble,\ntrustful faith, asking counsel of God, not following their own ideas,\nnot trusting to the bringing out of fanciful things to arouse the senses\nof those who are dead in trespasses and sins. The system of truth\nfound in the Word of God is capable of making impressions such as\nthe great Teacher desires to have made upon the intellect.\u2014Letter\n17, 1902.\n133\n134 Evangelism\nNever Bring Truth to Low Level\u2014Never bring the truth down\nto a low level in order to obtain converts, but seek to bring the\nsinful and corrupted up to the high standard of the law of God.\u2014\nManuscript 7, 1900.\nRefrain From All Theatrical Display \u2014I have a message for\nthose in charge of our work. Do not encourage the men who are\nto engage in this work to think that they must proclaim the solemn,\nsacred message in a theatrical style. Not one jot or tittle of anything\ntheatrical is to be brought into our work. God\u2019s cause is to have a\nsacred, heavenly mold. Let everything connected with the giving of\nthe message for this time bear the divine impress. Let nothing of a\ntheatrical nature be permitted, for this would spoil the sacredness of\nthe work.\nI am instructed that we shall meet with all kinds of experiences\nand that men will try to bring strange performances into the work of\nGod. We have met such things in many places. In my very first labors\nthe message was given that all theatrical performances in connection\nwith the preaching of present truth were to be discouraged and\nforbidden. Men who thought they had a wonderful work to do\nsought to adopt a strange deportment and manifested oddities in\nbodily exercise. The light given me was, \u201cGive this no sanction.\u201d[138]\nThese performances, which savored of the theatrical, were to have\nno place in the proclamation of the solemn messages entrusted to us.\nThe enemy will watch closely and will take every advantage of\ncircumstances to degrade the truth by the introduction of undignified\ndemonstrations. None of these demonstrations are to be encouraged.\nThe precious truths given us are to be spoken in all solemnity and\nwith sacred awe.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1910.\nDanger of Sensational Teachings\u2014You may be sure that pure\nand undefiled religion is not a sensational religion. God has not laid\nupon anyone the burden of encouraging an appetite for encouraging\nspeculative doctrines and theories. My brethren, keep these things\nout of your teaching.\u2014(Australasian) Union Conference Record,\nMarch 15, 1904.\nAvoid Fanaticism\u2014We are not to encourage a spirit of enthu-\nsiasm that brings zeal for a while, but soon fades away, leaving\ndiscouragement and depression. We need the bread of life that\ncomes down from heaven to give life to the soul. Study the Word of\nAvoiding Display and the Sensational 135\nGod. Do not be controlled by feeling. All who labor in the vineyard\nof the Lord must learn that feeling is not faith. To be always in a\nstate of elevation is not required. But it is required that we have firm\nfaith in the Word of God as the flesh and blood of Christ.\nThose who do the work of the Lord in our cities must close and\nbolt the doors firmly against excitement and fanaticism. The Word\nof God is our sanctification and righteousness, because it is spiritual\nfood. To study it is to eat the leaves of the tree of life. Nothing is\nmore uplifting to God\u2019s servants than to teach the Scriptures just as\nChrist taught them. The Word of God contains divine nourishment, [139]\nwhich satisfies the appetite for spiritual food.\u2014Letter 17, 1902.\nExpensive and Peculiar Methods\u2014You have chosen to work\nin a way that wears yourself out and absorbs a large amount of\nmeans.\nThis expensive outlay of means has been presented before you in\nits true bearing, and you have been told that such a way of working\nis not in harmony with the will of God. Your expensive and peculiar\nmethods of labor may appear at first to make a strong impression\non the people, but they soon reach the conclusion that the display is\nmade to call attention to yourself and your wife and children. The\nlarge expenditure of means is not in harmony with the solemn truths\npresented. Self has been placed on exhibition.\u2014Letter 205, 1904.\nNot to Ape the World\u2014We are handling subjects which involve\neternal interests, and we are not to ape the world in any respect. We\nare to follow closely the footsteps of Christ. He is a satisfying\nportion and can meet all our wants and necessities.\u2014Manuscript 96,\n1898.\nOur success will depend on carrying forward the work in the\nsimplicity in which Christ carried it forward, without any theatrical\ndisplay.\u2014Letter 53, 1904.\nGuarding Proper Approaches\nJesus Studied Natural Train of Thought\u2014The beneficent op-\nerations of nature are not accomplished by abrupt and startling\ninterpositions; men are not permitted to take her work into their\nown hands. God works through the calm, regular operation of His\nappointed laws. So it is in spiritual things. Satan is constantly seek-[140]\ning to produce effects by rude and violent thrusts; but Jesus found\naccess to minds by the pathway of their most familiar associations.\nHe disturbed as little as possible their accustomed train of thought,\nby abrupt actions or prescribed rules. He honored man with His\nconfidence, and thus placed him on his honor. He introduced old\ntruths in a new and precious light. Thus, when only twelve years\nold, He astonished the doctors of the law by His questions in the\ntemple.\nJesus assumed humanity, that He might meet humanity. He\nbrings men under the transforming power of truth by meeting them\nwhere they are. He gains access to the heart by securing sympathy\nand confidence, making all feel that His identification with their na-\nture and interest is complete. The truth came from His lips beautiful\nin its simplicity, yet clothed with dignity and power. What a teacher\nwas our Lord Jesus Christ! How tenderly did He treat every honest\nenquirer after truth, that He might gain admission to the sympathies,\nand find a home in the heart.\u2014Manuscript 44, 1894.\nResults Determined by Approaches\u2014We are to stand in this\nworld as though there were all around us the purchase of the blood\nof Christ, and as though it depended very much upon our words,\ndeportment, and manner of labor, whether these souls shall be saved\nor not.... It depends very much on the way we take hold to labor\nwhether we shall have souls as the result of our efforts.\u2014Manuscript\n14, 1887.\nSound Methods for Meeting Prejudice \u2014Brethren, you who\ngo forth to labor for those who are bound in chains of prejudice\nand ignorance, need to exercise the same divine wisdom that Paul\n136\nGuarding Proper Approaches 137\nmanifested. When you are laboring in a place where souls are just [141]\nbeginning to get the scales from their eyes, and to see men as trees\nwalking, be very careful not to present the truth in such a way as\nto arouse prejudice, and to close the door of the heart to the truth.\nAgree with the people on every point where you can consistently do\nso. Let them see that you love their souls, and want to be in harmony\nwith them so far as possible. If the love of Christ is revealed in all\nyour efforts, you will be able to sow the seed of truth in some hearts;\nGod will water the seed sown, and the truth will spring up and bear\nfruit to His glory.\nOur ministers need more of the wisdom that Paul had. When he\nwent to labor for the Jews, he did not first make prominent the birth,\nbetrayal, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, notwithstanding\nthese were the special truths for that time. He first brought them\ndown step by step over the promises that had been made of a Saviour,\nand over the prophecies that pointed Him out. After dwelling upon\nthese until the specifications were distinct in the minds of all, and\nthey knew that they were to have a Saviour, he then presented the\nfact that this Saviour had already come. Christ Jesus fulfilled every\nspecification. This was the \u201cguile\u201d with which Paul caught souls. He\npresented the truth in such a manner that their former prejudice did\nnot arise to blind their eyes and pervert their judgment.\u2014Historical\nSketches, 121, 122 (1886).\nCaution in Presenting Opening Subjects\u2014The greatest care\nis needed in dealing with these souls. Be always on guard. Do not\nat the outset press before the people the most objectionable features\nof our faith, lest you close the ears of those to whom these things\ncome as a new revelation.\nLet such portions of truth be dealt out to them as they may be [142]\nable to grasp and appreciate; though it should appear strange and\nstartling, many will recognize with joy that new light is shed on the\nWord of God. Whereas if truth were presented in so large a measure\nthat they could not receive it, some would go away and never come\nagain. More than this, they would misrepresent the truth, and in their\nexplanation of what was said they would so wrest the Scriptures as to\nconfuse other minds. We must take advantage of circumstances now.\nPresent the truth as it is in Jesus. There must be no combative or\ncontroversial spirit in the advocacy of truth.\u2014Manuscript 44, 1894.\n138 Evangelism\nStudy Community Needs Before Choosing Subjects \u2014Be-\ncome acquainted with the people in their homes. Test the spiritual\npulse and carry war into the camp. Create an interest. Pray and be-\nlieve, and you will gain an experience which will be of value to you.\nDo not take up subjects which are so deep that they require mind\nstruggles to comprehend. Pray and believe as you work. Awaken\nthe people to do something. In the name of the Lord work with\npersevering intensity.\u2014Letter 189, 1899.\nPreparing the Soil for the Good Seed\u2014Remember that great\ncare is to be exercised in regard to the presentation of truth. Carry\nthe minds along guardedly. Dwell upon practical godliness, weaving\nthe same into doctrinal discourses. The teachings and love of Christ\nwill soften and subdue the soil of the heart for the good seed of\ntruth.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nDo Not Arouse Controversy and Opposition\u2014Learn to meet\nthe people where they are. Do not present subjects that will arouse\ncontroversy. Let not your instruction be of a character to perplex the[143]\nmind.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:58 (1900).\nDo not arouse opposition before the people have had opportunity\nto hear the truth and know what they are opposing.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:36 (1900).\nDo Not Drive People From the Truth \u2014Upon us there rests\nthe solemn responsibility of presenting the truth to unbelievers in\nthe most forcible manner. How careful we should be not to present\nthe truth in a way that will drive men and women from it. Religious\nteachers stand where they can do great good or great evil....\nThe Lord calls upon us to come to the banquet of truth, and then\ngo out into the highways and hedges, and compel souls to come\nin, by presenting the great and wonderful offering that Christ has\nmade to the world. We are to present the truth in the way that Christ\ntold His disciples to present it\u2014in simplicity and love.\u2014Letter 177,\n1903.\nConsidering Pastors of Other Denominations\u2014It should ever\nbe manifest that we are reformers, but not bigots. When our laborers\nenter a new field, they should seek to become acquainted with the\npastors of the several churches in the place. [See also pp. 562-\n564, \u201cMinisters of Other Denominations.\u201d] Much has been lost by\nneglecting to do this. If our ministers show themselves friendly and\nGuarding Proper Approaches 139\nsociable, and do not act as if they were ashamed of the message they\nbear, it will have an excellent effect, and may give these pastors and\ntheir congregations favorable impressions of the truth. At any rate,\nit is right to give them a chance to be kind and favorable if they will.\nOur laborers should be very careful not to give the impression\nthat they are wolves stealing in to get the sheep, but should let the [144]\nministers understand their position and the object of their mission\u2014\nto call the attention of the people to the truths of God\u2019s Word. There\nare many of these which are dear to all Christians. Here is common\nground, upon which we can meet people of other denominations;\nand in becoming acquainted with them we should dwell mostly upon\ntopics in which all feel an interest, and which will not lead directly\nand pointedly to the subjects of disagreement.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, June 13, 1912.\nAvoid Unnecessary Barriers\u2014We should not, upon entering a\nplace, build up unnecessary barriers between us and other denom-\ninations, especially the Catholics, so that they think we are their\navowed enemies. We should not create a prejudice in their minds\nunnecessarily, by making a raid upon them. There are many among\nthe Catholics who live up to the light they have far better than many\nwho claim to believe present truth, and God will just as surely test\nand prove them as He has tested and proved us.\u2014Manuscript 14,\n1887.\nSpiritual Eyesight Needed\u2014Time, precious time, has been lost.\nGolden opportunities have passed by unimproved, because of a lack\nof clear spiritual eyesight and wise generalship to plan and devise\nways and means to frustrate the enemy and preoccupy the field....\nSlumbering watchmen, what of the night? Do you not know the\ntime of night? Do you feel no burden to lift the danger signal and\ngive the warnings for this time? If you do not, come down from the\nwalls of Zion, for God will not entrust you with the light He has to\ngive. Light is only given to those who will reflect that light upon\nothers.\u2014Manuscript 107, 1898.\nPlatform Decorum, Announcements, and[145]\nPreliminaries\nDignity of the Messenger\u2014Decorum is necessary in the desk.\nA minister of the gospel should not be regardless of his attitude.\nIf he is the representative of Christ, his deportment, his attitude,\nhis gestures, should be of such a character as will not strike the\nbeholder with disgust. Ministers should possess refinement. They\nshould discard all uncouth manners, attitudes, and gestures, and\nshould encourage in themselves humble dignity of bearing. They\nshould be clothed in a manner befitting the dignity of their position.\nTheir speech should be in every respect solemn and well chosen.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 1:648, 649 (1868).\nPlatform Conduct\u2014But things that are wrong often transpire\nin the sacred desk. One minister conversing with another in the\ndesk before the congregation, laughing and appearing to have no\nburden of the work, or lacking a solemn sense of their sacred calling,\ndishonors the truth, and brings the sacred down upon the low level of\ncommon things.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:612, 613 (1871).\nAn Offense to God\u2014Sometimes the assemblies of God\u2019s peo-\nple have been treated with a commonness which has been an offense\nto God and has robbed the sacred work of its holiness and purity.\u2014\nLetter 155, 1900.\nWaste No Time With Apologies\u2014Many speakers waste their\ntime and strength in long preliminaries and excuses. Some use nearly\nhalf an hour in making apologies; thus time is wasted, and when\nthey reach their subject and try to fasten the points of truth in the[146]\nminds of their hearers, the people are wearied out and cannot see\ntheir force.\nInstead of apologizing because he is about to address the people,\nthe minister should begin as if he knew that he was bearing a message\nfrom God.\u2014Gospel Workers, 168 (1915).\nThe Public Prayer\u2014The prayers offered in public should be\nshort and to the point. God does not require us to make the season of\n140\nPlatform Decorum, Announcements, and Preliminaries 141\nworship tedious by lengthy petitions....A few minutes is long enough\nfor any ordinary public petition.\u2014Gospel Workers, 175 (1915).\nPray With Heartfelt Simplicity\u2014We need not make long pub-\nlic prayers. With heartfelt simplicity we should state our needs to\nthe Lord, and claim His promises with such faith and confidence\nthat the congregation will know that we have learned to prevail with\nGod in prayer. They will be encouraged to believe that the Lord\u2019s\npresence is in the meeting, and they will open their hearts to receive\nHis rich blessing. Their faith in your sincerity will be increased, and\nthey will be ready to listen with willing ears to the instruction given\nby the speaker.\u2014Manuscript 127, 1902.\nHurried, Rushed Movements\u2014The Lord gave you your work,\nnot to be done in a rush, but in a calm, considerate manner. The\nLord never compels hurried, complicated movements.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 8:189 (1904).\nAvoiding the Grotesque\u2014We cannot be shepherds of the flock\nunless we are divested of our own peculiar habits, manners, and\ncustoms, and come into Christ\u2019s likeness. When we eat His flesh\nand drink His blood, then the element of eternal life will be found [147]\nin the ministry. There will not be a fund of stale, oft-repeated ideas.\nThere will be a new perception of truth.\nSome who stand in the pulpit make the heavenly messengers in\nthe audience ashamed of them. The precious gospel, which it has\ncost so much to bring to the world, is abused. There is common,\ncheap talk; grotesque attitudes and workings of the features. There\nis, with some, rapid talking, with others a thick, indistinct utterance.\nEveryone who ministers before the people should feel it a solemn\nduty to take himself in hand. He should first give himself to the\nLord in complete self-renunciation, determined that he will have\nnone of self, but all of Jesus.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel\nWorkers, 339 (1896).\nDiscard Uncomely Gestures and Uncouth Speech \u2014The\nworkman for God should make earnest efforts to become a rep-\nresentative of Christ, discarding all uncomely gestures and uncouth\nspeech. He should endeavor to use correct language. There is a\nlarge class who are careless in the way they speak; yet by careful,\npainstaking attention, these may become representatives of the truth.\nEvery day they should make advancement. They should not detract\n142 Evangelism\nfrom their usefulness and influence by cherishing defects of manner,\ntone, or language.\u2014Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,\n238 (1913).\nEvangelist\u2019s Personality\u2014The position of our ministers calls\nfor health of body and discipline of mind. Good sound sense, strong\nnerves, and a cheerful temper will recommend the gospel minister\nanywhere. These should be sought for, and perseveringly culti-\nvated.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:466 (1875).\nInterest-Holding Features [148]\nTruth Should Charm\u2014Let not your efforts be to follow the\nworld\u2019s way but to follow God\u2019s way. Outward display will not do\nthe work the Lord desires to have done to arouse the higher classes\nto a conviction that they have heard the truth. Do not divest the\ntruth of its dignity and impressiveness by preliminaries that are more\nafter the order of the world than after the order of heaven. Let your\nhearers understand that you do not hold Sunday evening meetings\nto charm their senses with music and other things, but to preach the\ntruth in all its solemnity, that it may come to them as a warning,\narousing them from their deathlike sleep of self-indulgence. It is the\nnaked truth that, like a sharp, two-edged sword, cuts both ways....\nThose who in their work for God depend on worldly plans for\ngaining success will make a failure. The Lord calls for a change in\nyour manner of labor. He desires you to practice the lessons taught\nin the life of Christ. Then the mold of Christ will be seen on all the\nmeetings that you hold.\u2014Letter 48, 1902.\nCreative Teaching\u2014The Prince of teachers sought access to\nthe people by the pathway of their most familiar associations. He\npresented the truth in such a way that ever after it was to His hearers\nintertwined with their most hallowed recollections and sympathies.\nHe taught in a way that made them feel the completeness of His\nidentification with their interests and happiness. His instruction was\nso simple, His illustrations so appropriate, His words so sympathetic\nand so cheerful, that His hearers were charmed.\nChrist drew many of his illustrations and lessons from the great\ntreasure house of nature. He plucked a lily and pointed His hearers [149]\nto its simplicity and marvelous beauty. He pointed to the grass of\nthe field, saying, \u201cIf God so clothe the grass of the field, which\ntoday is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall He not much more\nclothe you?\u201d He desires us to see that the things of nature are an\nexpression of the love of God, and that, though marred by sin, they\nstill speak to us of the Eden home in which Adam and Eve were\n143\n144 Evangelism\nplaced. He desires us to be reminded by them of the time when this\nhome shall be restored, and the earth shall be filled with the praise\nof the Lord.\u2014Letter 213, 1902.\nHe Held Their Interest\u2014The people listened to the words of\nmercy flowing so freely from the lips of the Son of God. They heard\nthe gracious words, so simple and so plain that they were as the balm\nof Gilead to their souls. The healing of His divine hand brought\ngladness and life to the dying, and ease and health to those suffering\nwith disease. The day seemed to them like heaven upon earth, and\nthey were utterly unconscious of how long it had been since they\nhad eaten anything....\nHe who taught the people the way to secure peace and happiness\nwas just as thoughtful of their temporal necessities as of their spiritual\nneed. The people were weary and faint. There were mothers with\nbabes in their arms, and little children clinging to their skirts. Many\nhad been standing for hours. They had been so intensely interested\nin Christ\u2019s words that they had not once thought of sitting down, and\nthe crowd was so great that there was danger of their trampling on\none another. Jesus would give them a chance to rest, and He bade\nthem sit down. There was much grass in the place, and all could rest\nin comfort.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 365, 366 (1898).\nAn Effective Interest-holding Program\u2014There was given me[150]\nanother sight. Tents were taken to different places during camp\nmeeting season. Camp meetings were held in different locations.\nThese were conducted by able, God-fearing men, having suitable\nhelpers. There were children\u2019s meetings and revival meetings and\nan earnest effort to bring the people to a decision. A Paul may plant,\nan Apollos water, but God giveth the increase....\nLet the talent of singing be brought into the work. The use of\nmusical instruments is not at all objectionable. These were used\nin religious services in ancient times. The worshipers praised God\nupon the harp and cymbal, and music should have its place in our\nservices. It will add to the interest.\nBut hold the attention of the people by presenting before them\nthe truth as it is in Jesus. Keep before them the cross of Calvary.\nWhat called for the death of Christ? The transgression of the law.\nChrist died to give men an opportunity to become loyal subjects of\nHis kingdom.\nInterest-Holding Features 145\nLet there be short discourses, short and fervent prayers. Educate,\neducate in regard to thorough, whole-souled service. Thorough\nconsecration, much prayer, an intense earnestness, will make an\nimpression; for angels of God will be present to move upon the\nhearts of the people.\u2014Letter 132, 1898.\nVariety of Evangelistic Attractions \u2014At these meetings are\ngathered high and low, rich and poor, sinners of all degrees, and all\nhear the message of mercy given by the Lord\u2019s delegated servants.\nThere is a variety of Bible subjects presented, and a variety of\nexercises during the meeting.\nOld and young are called, and the Lord impresses the hearts\nof the hearers. By this means the call to the supper, as presented [151]\nin the parable, is given to all. Some who, according to their own\nconfession, have not entered a church for twelve, fourteen, and even\nsixteen years, are convicted and converted. Church members are\ndeeply stirred, and listen with astonishment to the sermons and Bible\nreadings explaining the Scriptures; and in the social meetings there\nis found something appropriate for every case.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1900.\nGreat Themes\u2014Up-to-Date Message\u2014Those who stand be-\nfore the people as teachers of truth are to grapple with great themes.\nThey are not to occupy precious time in talking of trivial subjects.\nLet them study the Word, and preach the Word. Let the Word be in\ntheir hands as a sharp, two-edged sword. Let it testify to past truths\nand show what is to be in the future.\nChrist came from heaven to give to John the great, wonderful\ntruths that are to shape our lives and that by us are to be proclaimed\nto the world. We are to keep abreast of the times, bearing a clear,\nintelligent testimony, guided by the unction of the Holy Spirit.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, April 19, 1906.\nInquiry and Question Meetings\nCall Interested to an Aftermeeting\u2014The testing truth for this\ntime is to be made known, and the explanation given. All classes, the\nhigher as well as the most lowly, come to these meetings, and we are\nto work for all. After the warning message has been given, let those\nwho are specially interested be called to the tent by themselves, and\nthere labor for their conversion. This kind of labor is missionary\nwork of the highest order.\u2014Letter 86, 1900.\nTeach How to Become Christians \u2014I wish you to distinctly[152]\nunderstand this point, that souls are kept from obeying the truth by\na confusion of ideas, and also because they do not know how to\nsurrender their wills and their minds to Jesus. They want special\ninstruction how to become Christians. The work done for Christ in\nthe world is not made of great deeds and wonderful achievements.\nThese will come in as needed. But the most successful work is that\nwhich keeps self as much as possible out of sight. It is the work\nof giving line upon line and precept upon precept, here a little and\nthere a little; coming close in sympathy with human hearts. This is\nthe service done to Jesus Christ that will be recognized at the last\nday.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nCome Close to the People in the Afterinterview \u2014There is\ndanger of passing too rapidly from point to point. Give short lessons,\nand often.... After you have opened to the people the precious mines\nof truth, there is yet a great work to be done for those who have\nbecome interested in the subjects presented.\nAfter a short discourse, change the order of the exercises, and\ngive opportunity for all who desire it, to remain for an afterinterview,\nor Bible class, where they can ask questions upon subjects that\ntrouble them. You will find great success in coming close to the\npeople in these Bible lessons. The workers who labor in connection\nwith the minister should make special efforts patiently and kindly to\nlead inquirers to an understanding of the truth.\n146\nInquiry and Question Meetings 147\nIf you have not more than one to instruct, that one, thoroughly\nconvinced, will communicate the light to others. These testing\ntruths are of so great importance that they may be presented again\nand again, and impressed upon the minds of the hearers.\u2014Special [153]\nTestimonies, Series A, No. 7, p. 7. (1874).\nAn Opportunity to Ask Questions\u2014Whenever practicable, ev-\nery important discourse should be followed by a Bible study. Here\nthe points that have been presented can be applied, questions can\nbe asked, and right ideas inculcated. More time should be devoted\nto patiently educating the people, giving them opportunity to ex-\npress themselves. It is instruction that men need, line upon line, and\nprecept upon precept.\nSpecial meetings also should be held for those who are becoming\ninterested in the truths presented and who need instruction. To these\nmeetings the people should be invited, and all, both believers and\nunbelievers, should have an opportunity to ask questions on points\nnot fully understood. Give all an opportunity to speak of their\nperplexities, for they will have them. In all the sermons and in\nall the Bible studies, let the people see that on every point a plain\n\u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d is given for the faith and doctrines which we\nadvocate.\nThis was the method of Christ\u2019s teaching. As he spoke to the\npeople, they would question as to His meaning. To those who\nwere humbly seeking for light, He was always ready to explain His\nwords. But Christ did not encourage criticism or caviling, nor should\nwe. When men try to provoke a discussion of controverted points\nof doctrine, tell them that the meeting was not appointed for that\npurpose.\nWhen you do answer a question, be sure to have the hearers see\nand acknowledge that it is answered. Do not let a question drop,\ntelling them to ask it again. Feel your way step by step, and know\nhow much you have gained.\nIn such meetings, those who understand the message can ask [154]\nquestions which will bring out light on points of truth. But some\nmay not have wisdom to do this. When any put questions that serve\nonly to confuse the mind and sow the seeds of doubt, they should\nbe advised to refrain from such questioning. We must learn when\nto speak and when to keep silent, learn to sow the seeds of faith, to\n148 Evangelism\nimpart light, not darkness.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:68, 69\n(1900).\nDraw the People Out by Questions \u2014After a short discourse\nkeep fresh, that you may give a Bible reading on the points spoken\nof, drawing the people out by questions. Come right to the hearts of\nyour hearers, urging them to present their difficulties to you, that you\nmay explain the Scriptures which they do not comprehend.\u2014Letter\n8, 1895.\nA Point to Guard Well\u2014Whenever the Lord has a special work\nto do among His people, when He would arouse their minds to con-\ntemplate vital truth, Satan will work to divert the mind by introducing\nminor points of difference, in order that he may create an issue con-\ncerning doctrines that are not essential to the understanding of the\npoint in hand, and thus bring about disunion, and distract attention\nfrom the essential point. When this occurs, the Lord is at work\nmaking impressions upon the hearts of men, concerning that which\nis necessary to their salvation. Then if Satan can draw the mind\naway to some unimportant issue, and cause the people to divide on\nsome minor point, so that their hearts are barricaded against light\nand truth, he exults in malicious triumph.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nOctober 18, 1892.\nCombativeness Raised; Conviction Quenched\u2014Satan is con-\nstantly at work to divert the mind with earthly things, that the truth\nmay lose its force upon the heart; and then there will be no progress,\nno advancement from light and knowledge, to greater light and[155]\nknowledge. Unless the followers of Christ are constantly stirred up\nto practice the truth, they will not be sanctified through it. Questions,\nspeculations, and matters of no vital importance will occupy the\nmind, and become the subject of conversation, and then there will\nbe caviling and striving about words, and presenting of different\nopinions, concerning points that are not vital or essential....\nThe laborer for God must be wise enough to see the design of\nthe enemy, and to refuse to be misled and diverted. The conversion\nof the souls of his hearers must be the burden of his work, and he\nmust keep out of controversy, and preach the Word of God....\nThe special, deceptive work of Satan has been to provoke con-\ntroversies, that there might be strivings about words to no profit. He\nwell knows that this will occupy the mind and the time. It raises the\nInquiry and Question Meetings 149\ncombativeness, and quenches the spirit of conviction, in the minds\nof many, drawing them into diversity of opinions, accusation, and\nprejudice, which closes the door to the truth.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 11, 1888.\nPraying With Those Under Conviction \u2014Let ministers and\nevangelists have more seasons of earnest prayer with those who\nare convicted by the truth. Remember that Christ is always with\nyou. The Lord has in readiness the most precious exhibitions of His\ngrace, to strengthen and encourage the sincere, humble worker.\u2014\nManuscript 78, 1900.\nHelp the Perplexed\u2014Many who come to the meeting are weary\nand heavy laden with sin. They do not feel safe in their religious\nfaith. Opportunity should be given for those who are troubled and\nwant rest in spirit to find help. After a discourse those who wish to\nfollow Christ should be invited to signify their desire. Invite all who [156]\nare not satisfied that they are prepared for Christ\u2019s coming, and all\nwho feel burdened and heavy laden, to come apart by themselves.\nLet those who are spiritual converse with these souls. Pray with and\nfor them. Let much time be spent in prayer and close searching of\nthe Word. Let all obtain the real facts of faith in their own souls\nthrough belief that the Holy Spirit will be imparted to them because\nthey have a real hungering and thirsting after righteousness. Teach\nthem how to surrender themselves to God, how to believe, how to\nclaim the promises. Let the deep love of God be expressed in words\nof encouragement, in words of intercession.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 6:65 (1900).\nGetting Acquainted With the People\nMeeting the People as They Come and Go\u2014In conducting the\nimportant interests of meetings near a large city, the co-operation of\nall the workers is essential. They should keep in the very atmosphere\nof the meetings, becoming acquainted with the people as they come\nin and go out, showing the utmost courtesy and kindness, and tender\nregard for their souls. They should be ready to speak to them in\nseason and out of season, watching to win souls. O that Christ\u2019s\nworkers would show one half as much vigilance as does Satan,\nwho is always on the track of human beings, always wide awake,\nwatching to lay some gin or snare for their destruction.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:46 (1900).\nEvangelist\u2019s Responsibility to the Interested\u2014It is important\nthat all who design to labor in the cause of God should learn the\nvery best manner of prosecuting their work.... I have been shown[157]\nthat many efforts which have been made at great expense to present\nthe truth, have been in a large measure unsuccessful, because the\nvery kind of labor that is required has not been done. We have tried\nfor years to present before our people the necessity of working more\nintelligently....\nWhen the discourses are given in the desk, the work is just en-\ntered upon. Then the minister should, by personal effort if possible,\nbecome acquainted with every one of his hearers. If they have inter-\nest enough to come out and hear what you have to say, you should\nrespond to it by a decided interest on your part to make their personal\nacquaintance....\nSatan and his agents are sharper than our workers. While he is\nplanning and devising and laying his nets to take souls unawares,\nour brethren are frequently taking things in a very easy manner, and\nSatan out-generals them almost every time. Now, if they would have\nthe field preoccupied by God and by heavenly angels, they must\nthrow their whole being, soul, body, and spirit, into the work of\n150\nGetting Acquainted With the People 151\nGod, and not make a pretense of doing the work, when it is not half\ndone....\nThe discourse given from the desk should not be lengthy, for this\nnot only wearies the people, but so draws upon the time and strength\nof the minister that he is not able to engage in the personal labor\nwhich should follow. He should go from house to house and labor\nwith families, calling their attention to eternal truths in the Word of\nGod. [See also pp. 429-455, \u201cPersonal Work.\u201d] If he does this labor\nin the meekness of Christ, he will surely have the angels of God to\nwork with his efforts. But we are altogether too faithless and too\nnarrow in our ideas and in our plans.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1887.\nHe will become acquainted with the parents and children in his [158]\ncongregation, and will speak kind, earnest words to them.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, January 21, 1902.\nGet Into the Families\u2014Come close to the people; get into the\nfamilies when you can; do not wait for the people to hunt up the\nshepherd. Bear with you the confidence and assurance of faith which\nevidences that you are not trusting in idle tales but in a plain \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord.\u201d\u2014Letter 8, 1895.\nContacts at Public Meetings \u2014When Christ was teaching on\nearth, He watched the countenances of His hearers, and the kindling\neye, the animated expression, told Him in a moment when one\nassented to the truth. Even so should the teachers of the people now\nstudy the countenances of their hearers.\nWhen they see a person in the audience who seems interested,\nthey should make it a point to form his acquaintance before leaving\nthe place of meeting, and, if possible, should ascertain where he\nlives, and visit him. It is this kind of personal labor that helps to\nmake him a perfect workman. It enables him to prove his work,\nto give full proof of his ministry. This is also the most successful\nway of reaching the people; for by this means their attention is best\nsecured.\u2014Historical Sketches, 147, 148 (1886).\nWinning Confidence by Home Contacts\u2014There are numbers\nof families who will never be reached by the truth of God\u2019s Word\nunless the stewards of the manifold grace of Christ enter their homes,\nand by earnest ministry, sanctified by the endorsement of the Holy\nSpirit, break down the barriers and enter the hearts of the people.\nAs the people see that these workers are messengers of mercy, the\n152 Evangelism\nministers of grace, they are ready to listen to the words spoken by\nthem. But the hearts of those who do this work must throb in unison[159]\nwith the heart of Christ. They must be wholly consecrated to the\nservice of God, ready to do His bidding, to go wheresoever His\nprovidence leads them, and speak the words He gives them. And\nif they are what God desires they shall be, if they are imbued with\nHis Holy Spirit, they co-operate with the heavenly agencies and are\nindeed \u201claborers together with God.\u201d\u2014Letter 95, 1896.\nPrinted Sermons And Literature\nThe Effective Use of Literature\u2014The truth must be published\nfar more extensively than it yet has been. It must be defined in\nclear, sharp lines before the people. It must be presented in short but\nconclusive arguments, and plans must be laid that at every meeting\nwhere the truth has been set before the people, it may be followed\nby the distribution of tracts and pamphlets. At the present time it\nmay be found necessary to give these away, but they will be a power\nfor good, and nothing will be lost.\nThe discourses given in the desk would be far more effective if\nreading matter were circulated, educating the hearers in the doctrines\nof the Bible. God will make many willing to read, but there will also\nbe many who will refuse to see or hear anything upon the present\ntruth. But we should not even think these cases beyond hope, for\nChrist is drawing many to Himself.... You should go forth with your\nhands filled with proper reading matter, and your heart filled with\nthe love of God.\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\nTo Forestall Effects of Opposition\u2014When a discourse is given,\nthe people may listen with interest, but it is all strange and new to [160]\nthem, and Satan is ready to suggest to their minds many things that\nare not true. He will seek to pervert and misrepresent the speaker\u2019s\nwords. What shall we do?\nThe discourses presenting the reasons of our faith should be pub-\nlished in little leaflets, and circulated as widely as possible. [Note.\u2014\nIn the matter of printing or mimeographing sermons, every worker\nshould labor in harmony with the counsel of the General Conference\nCommittee set forth in the following resolution adopted December\n15, 1941, relating to the safeguarding of our public utterance:\n\u201cThat before issuance, all mimeographed and printed sermons\nbe first approved by the leadership of the local conference in which\none is laboring, as a safeguarding, protective measure.\u201d] Thus the\nfalsehoods and misrepresentations which the enemy of truth con-\nstantly tries to keep in circulation would be revealed in their true\n153\n154 Evangelism\ncharacter, and the people would have an opportunity of knowing just\nwhat the minister said.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 14, 1902.\nShort Printed Discourses\u2014Let a synopsis of the discourses be\nprinted and widely circulated.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1905.\nHandbills\u2014If a press can be secured to be worked during the\nmeeting, printing leaflets, notices and papers for distribution, it will\nhave a telling influence.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:36 (1900).\nSome Only Reached by Literature\u2014Very much more can be\naccomplished by the living preacher with the circulation of papers\nand tracts than by the preaching of the Word alone without the\npublications.... Many minds can be reached in no other way. Here\nis true missionary work in which labor and means can be invested\nwith the best results.\u2014Life Sketches, p. 217. (1915).\nThe Power of the Press \u2014The press is a powerful means to\nmove the minds and hearts of the people. The men of this world seize\nthe press, and make the most of every opportunity to get poisonous[161]\nliterature before the people. If men, under the influence of the spirit\nof the world and of Satan, are earnest to circulate books, tracts,\nand papers of a corrupting nature, you should be more earnest to\nget reading matter of an elevating and saving character before the\npeople.\nGod has placed at the command of His people advantages in the\npress, which, combined with other agencies, will be successful in\nextending the knowledge of the truth. Tracts, papers, and books, as\nthe case demands, should be circulated in all the cities and villages\nin the land.\u2014Life Sketches, pp. 216, 217. (1915).\nTruth Given Wings\u2014There is great need of men who can use\nthe press to the best advantage, that the truth may be given wings to\nspeed it to every nation, and tongue, and people.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n25 (1915).\nThe Printed Page\u2014Though the minister may faithfully present\nthe message, the people are not able to retain it all. The printed page\nis therefore essential, not only in awakening them to the importance\nof the truth for this time, but in rooting and grounding them in the\ntruth, and establishing them against deceptive error. Papers and\nbooks are the Lord\u2019s means of keeping the message for this time\ncontinually before the people. In enlightening and confirming souls\nin the truth, the publications will do a far greater work than can\nPrinted Sermons And Literature 155\nbe accomplished by the ministry of the Word alone. The silent\nmessengers that are placed in the homes of the people through the\nwork of the canvasser, will strengthen the gospel ministry in every\nway; for the Holy Spirit will impress minds as they read the books,\njust as He impresses the minds of those who listen to the preaching [162]\nof the Word. The same ministry of angels attends the books that\ncontain the truth as attends the work of the ministry.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:315, 316 (1900).\nThe Debate\n[See also pp. 301-306, \u201cMeeting Prejudice and Opposition.\u201d]\nGod Is Seldom Glorified\u2014In some cases, it may be necessary\nto meet a proud boaster against the truth of God in open debate; but\ngenerally these discussions, either oral or written, result in more\nharm than good.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:213 (1872).\nDiscussions cannot always be avoided.... People who love to see\nopponents combat, may clamor for discussion. Others, who have\na desire to hear the evidences on both sides, may urge discussion\nin all honesty of motive; but whenever discussions can be avoided,\nthey should be.... God is seldom glorified or the truth advanced in\nthese combats.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:424 (1875).\nOpposers Must Sometimes Be Met \u2014There are occasions\nwhere their glaring misrepresentations will have to be met. When\nthis is the case, it should be done promptly and briefly, and we\nshould then pass on to our work.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:37\n(1872).\nTo Meet Defiance but Not Defy\u2014In the presentation of unpop-\nular truth, which involves a heavy cross, preachers should be careful\nthat every word is as God would have it. Their words should never\ncut. They should present the truth in humility, with the deepest love\nfor souls, and an earnest desire for their salvation, and let the truth\ncut. They should not defy ministers of other denominations, and[163]\nseek to provoke a debate. They should not stand in a position like\nthat of Goliath when he defied the armies of Israel. Israel did not\ndefy Goliath but Goliath made his proud boasts against God and His\npeople. The defying, the boasting, and the railing must come from\nthe opposers of truth, who act the Goliath. But none of this spirit\nshould be seen in those whom God has sent forth to proclaim the\nlast message of warning to a doomed world....\nIf they, like David, are brought into a position where God\u2019s cause\nreally calls for them to meet a defier of Israel, and if they go forth\nin the strength of God, relying wholly upon Him, He will carry\n156\nDebate 157\nthem through, and cause His truth to triumph gloriously. Christ has\ngiven us an example. \u201cYet Michael the Archangel, when contending\nwith the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring\nagainst him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.\u201d\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 3:218-220 (1872).\nControversial Spirit Lays Weak Foundation \u2014The spirit of\ndebate, of controversy, is a device of Satan to stir up combativeness,\nand thus eclipse the truth as it is in Jesus. Many have thus been\nrepulsed instead of being won to Christ....\nA controversial spirit is encouraged. Many dwell almost ex-\nclusively upon doctrinal subjects, while the nature of true piety,\nexperimental Godliness, receives little attention. Jesus, His love\nand grace, His self-denial and self-sacrifice, His meekness and for-\nbearance, are not brought before the people as they should be. The\nerrors existing everywhere have, like parasites, fastened their deadly\npoison upon the boughs of truth and in many minds have become\nidentified with it; many who accept the truth teach it in a harsh spirit. [164]\nA false conception of it is given to the people, and the truth is made\nof no effect to those whose hearts are not softened and subdued by\nthe Holy Spirit....\nIt is essential for all to discern and appreciate the truth; therefore\nit is of the greatest importance that the seed of the Word should fall\ninto soil prepared for its reception. The question with us individually\nshould be, How shall we sow the precious seed of truth so that it\nshall not be lost, but spring up and produce a harvest, that sheaves\nmay be brought to the master?\u2014The Review and Herald, February\n9, 1892.\nDanger of Excitement and Rapid Decision \u2014If the interest\nsteadily increases, and the people move understandingly, not from\nimpulse, but from principle, the interest is much more healthy and\ndurable than it is where a great excitement and interest are created\nsuddenly, and the feelings are excited by listening to a debate, a sharp\ncontest on both sides of the question, for and against the truth. Fierce\nopposition is thus created, positions are taken, and rapid decisions\nmade. A feverish state of things is the result. Calm consideration and\njudgment are wanting. Let this excitement subside, or let reaction\ntake place by indiscreet management, and the interest can never\nbe raised again. The feelings and sympathies of the people were\n158 Evangelism\nstirred, but their consciences were not convicted, their hearts were\nnot broken and humbled before God.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n3:218 (1872).\nPresenting Truth to Prejudiced Minds \u2014God\u2019s ministers\nshould not count the opportunity of engaging in discussion a great\nprivilege. All points of our faith are not to be borne to the front and\npresented before the prejudiced crowds.... The truths that we hold\nin common should be dwelt upon first, and the confidence of the[165]\nhearers obtained.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:426 (1875).\nIn Debate We Meet Satan \u2014Ministers who contend with op-\nposers of the truth of God, do not have to meet men merely, but\nSatan and his host of evil angels. Satan watches for a chance to get\nthe advantage of ministers who are advocating the truth, and when\nthey cease to put their entire trust in God, and their words are not\nin the spirit and love of Christ, the angels of God cannot strengthen\nand enlighten them. They leave them to their own strength, and evil\nangels press in their darkness; for this reason, the opponents of the\ntruth sometimes seem to have the advantage, and the discussion does\nmore harm than real good.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:220,\n221 (1872).\nIf Debate Cannot Be Avoided\u2014Whenever it is necessary for\nthe advancement of the cause of truth and the glory of God, that an\nopponent be met, how carefully, and with what humility should they\n[the advocates of truth] go into the conflict. With heartsearching,\nconfession of sin, and earnest prayer, and often fasting for a time,\nthey should entreat that God would especially help them, and give\nHis saving, precious truth a glorious victory, that error might appear\nin its true deformity, and its advocates be completely discomfited....\nNever should you enter upon a discussion, where so much is\nat stake, relying upon your aptness to handle strong arguments.\nIf it cannot be well avoided, enter the conflict, but enter upon it\nwith firm trust in God, and in the spirit of humility, in the spirit of\nJesus, who has bidden you learn of Him who is meek and lowly in\nheart.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:624, 626 (1867).\nPresent the Truth\u2014The best way to deal with error is to present[166]\nthe truth, and leave wild ideas to die for want of notice. Contrasted\nwith truth, the weakness of error is made apparent to every intelligent\nmind. The more the erroneous assertions of opposers, and of those\nDebate 159\nwho rise up among us to deceive souls, are repeated, the better\nthe cause of error is served. The more publicity is given to the\nsuggestions of Satan, the better pleased is his Satanic majesty.\u2014\nTestimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 165 (1892).\nUse Only Sound Arguments \u2014It is important that in defend-\ning the doctrines which we consider fundamental articles of faith,\nwe should never allow ourselves to employ arguments that are not\nwholly sound. These may avail to silence an opposer, but they do\nnot honor the truth. We should present sound arguments, that will\nnot only silence our opponents, but will bear the closest and most\nsearching scrutiny.\nWith those who have educated themselves as debaters, there\nis great danger that they will not handle the Word of God with\nfairness. In meeting an opponent, it should be our earnest effort to\npresent subjects in such a manner as to awaken conviction in his\nmind, instead of seeking merely to give confidence to the believer.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 5:708 (1889).\nLay Off the Pugilistic Armor \u2014Those who bear the most\nsolemn message ever given to our world must lay off the pugilistic\narmor, and put on the armor of Christ\u2019s righteousness. We have no\nneed to work in our own finite individuality, for then the angels of\nGod stand back and leave us to carry on the warfare alone. When\nwill our ministers learn of Jesus? Our preparation to meet opponents\nor to minister to the people must be obtained of God at the throne\nof heavenly grace. Here, in receiving the grace of God, our own [167]\nincompetence is seen and acknowledged. The dignity and glory of\nChrist is our strength. The Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance leads us into all\ntruth. The Holy Spirit takes the things of God and shows them unto\nus, conveying them as a living power into the obedient heart. We\nthen have the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, which\ntakes the perfect impress of its Author.\u2014Letter 21a, 1895.\n160 Evangelism\nSection 7\u2014The Message and its [168]\nPresentation\nSpirit and Manner of Presenting the Message\nImportance of the Manner of Presenting Truth\u2014The manner\nin which the truth is presented often has much to do in determin-\ning whether it will be accepted or rejected.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 4:404, 405 (1880).\nIt is to be regretted that many do not realize that the manner in\nwhich Bible truth is presented has much to do with the impressions\nmade upon minds, and with the Christian character afterward devel-\noped by those who receive the truth. Instead of imitating Christ in\nHis manner of labor, many are severe, critical, and dictatorial. They\nrepulse instead of winning souls. Such will never know how many\nweak ones their harsh words have wounded and discouraged.\u2014His-\ntorical Sketches, p. 121. (1886).\nStartling Messages\u2014Most startling messages will be borne by\nmen of God\u2019s appointment, messages of a character to warn the\npeople, to arouse them. And while some will be provoked by the\nwarning, and led to resist light and evidence, we are to see from this\nthat we are giving the testing message for this time.... We must also\nhave, in our cities, consecrated evangelists through whom a message\nis to be borne so decidedly as to startle the hearers.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 9:137 (1909).\nWith Certainty and Decision\u2014There is a living power in truth,[169]\nand the Holy Spirit is the agent that opens human minds to the truth.\nBut the ministers and workers who proclaim the truth must show\ncertainty and decision. They are to go forth in faith, and present the\nWord as though they believed it. Try to make those for whom you\nlabor understand that it is God\u2019s truth. Preach Jesus Christ and Him\ncrucified. This will confront Satan\u2019s lies.\u2014Letter 34, 1896.\nThe Word of the Living God\u2014If your way of presenting the\ntruth is God\u2019s way, your audience will be deeply impressed with the\ntruth you present. The conviction will come to them that it is the\nword of the living God, and you will accomplish the will of God in\npower.\u2014Letter 48, 1902.\n162\nSpirit and Manner of Presenting the Message 163\nBig Ideas of Scripture Truth \u2014You do not present yourself,\nbut the presence and preciousness of truth is so large, why, it is so\nfar-reaching, so deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of.... Preach so\nthat the people can catch hold of big ideas and dig out the precious\nore hid in the Scriptures.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1894.\nMeetings to Witness Deep Movings of Spirit \u2014At our meet-\nings held in the cities, and at our camp meetings, we do not ask for\ngreat demonstrations, but we ask that the men who come before the\npeople to present the truth shall be in earnest, and shall reveal that\nGod is with them. There must be a special seeking after God, that\nthe work of the meeting may be carried on under the deep movings\nof the Holy Spirit. There must be no mingling of the wrong with the\nright.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 23, 1908.\nMore Activity and Zeal\u2014We need to break up the monotony\nof our religious labor. We are doing a work in the world, but we are\nnot showing enough activity and zeal. If we were more in earnest, [170]\nmen would be convinced of the truth of our message. The tameness\nand monotony of our service for God repels many who are looking\nto see in us a deep, earnest, sanctified zeal. Legal religion will\nnot answer for this age. We may perform all the outward acts of\nservice, and yet be as destitute of the quickening influence of the\nHoly Spirit as the hills of Gilboa were destitute of dew and rain. We\nneed spiritual moisture; and we need also the bright beams of the\nSun of Righteousness to soften and subdue our hearts.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, May 26, 1903.\nCalm, Earnest Reasoning \u2014It is not excitement we wish to\ncreate, but deep, earnest consideration, that those who hear shall\ndo solid work, real, sound, genuine work that will be enduring as\neternity. We hunger not for excitement, for the sensational; the less\nwe have of this, the better. The calm, earnest reasoning from the\nScriptures is precious and fruitful. Here is the secret of success,\nin preaching a living personal Saviour in so simple and earnest a\nmanner that the people may be able to lay hold by faith of the power\nof the Word of life.\u2014Letter 102, 1894.\nPresent the Evidences of Truth\u2014People cannot be expected to\nsee at once the advantage of truth over the error they have cherished.\nThe best way to expose the fallacy of error is to present the evidences\nof truth. This is the greatest rebuke that can be given to error. Dispel\n164 Evangelism\nthe cloud of darkness resting on minds by reflecting the bright light\nof the Sun of Righteousness.\u2014Pacific Union Recorder, October 23,\n1902.\nWin Confidence of the People \u2014Those who labor for Christ\nshould be men and women of great discretion, so that those who do\nnot understand their doctrines may be led to respect them, and regard\nthem as persons void of fanaticism, void of rashness and impetuosity.[171]\nTheir discourses and conduct and conversation should be of a nature\nthat will lead men to the conclusion that these ministers are men\nof thought, of solidity of character, men who fear and love their\nheavenly Father. They should win the confidence of the people, so\nthat those who listen to the preaching may know that the ministers\nhave not come with some cunningly devised fable, but that their\nwords are words of worth, a testimony that demands thought and\nattention. Let the people see you exalting Jesus, and hiding self.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, April 26, 1892.\nNo Long, Far-fetched, Complicated Reasoning \u2014Christ sel-\ndom attempted to prove that truth is truth. He illustrated truth in\nall its bearings, and then left His hearers free to accept or reject it,\nas they might choose. He did not force anyone to believe. In the\nsermon on the mount He instructed the people in practical Godli-\nness, distinctly outlining their duty. He spoke in such a manner as\nto commend truth to the conscience. The power manifested by the\ndisciples was revealed in the clearness and earnestness with which\nthey expressed the truth.\nIn Christ\u2019s teaching there is no long, far-fetched, complicated\nreasoning. He comes right to the point. In His ministry He read\nevery heart as an open book, and from the inexhaustible store of\nHis treasure house He drew things both new and old to illustrate\nand enforce His teachings. He touched the heart, and awakened the\nsympathies.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1891.\nSimple, Forcible Doctrinal Teaching\u2014A few forcible remarks\nupon some point of doctrine will fasten it in the mind much more\nfirmly than if such a mass of matter were presented that nothing\nlies out clear and distinct in the mind of those ignorant of our faith. [172]\nThere should be interspersed with the prophecies practical lessons\nof the teachings of Christ.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nSpirit and Manner of Presenting the Message 165\nGod Will Give Fit Words\u2014What a privilege it is to labor for the\nconversion of souls! Our calling is high.... To fit us to do this work,\nHe will strengthen our mental faculties as verily as He did the mind\nof Daniel. As we teach those in darkness to understand the truths that\nhave enlightened us, God will teach us to understand these truths still\nbetter ourselves. He will give us apt words to speak, communicating\nto us through the angel standing by our side.\u2014Manuscript 126,\n1902.\nLess Controversy-More of Christ\u2014We need far less contro-\nversy, and far more presentation of Christ. Our Redeemer is the cen-\nter of all our faith and hope. Those who can present His matchless\nlove, and inspire hearts to give Him their best and holiest affections,\nare doing work that is great and holy.\u2014The Colporteur Evangelist,\n60, 61 (1902).\nThe many argumentative sermons preached seldom soften and\nsubdue the soul.\u2014Letter 15, 1892.\nDo Not Rail\u2014Those who advocate the truth can afford to be\nfair and pleasant. It does not need the human mixing in. It is not for\nyou to use the Holy Spirit of God, but it is for the Holy Spirit to use\nyou....\nBe careful that you do not rail once. We want the Holy Spirit\nof God to be life and voice for us. Our tongue should be as the pen\nof a ready writer, because the Spirit of God is speaking through the\nhuman agent. When you use that twit and fling, you have stirred in\nsome of yourself, and we do not want anything of that mixture.\u2014\nManuscript 7, 1894.\nDo Not Attack Authorities\u2014Our work is not to make a raid on [173]\nthe Government but to prepare a people to stand in the great day of\nthe Lord. The fewer attacks we make on authorities and powers, the\nmore work will we do for God....\nWhile the truth must be defended, this work is to be done in the\nspirit of Jesus. If God\u2019s people work without peace and love, they\nwork at a great loss, an irretrievable loss. Souls are driven from\nChrist even after they have been connected with His work.\nWe are not to pass judgment on those who have not had the\nopportunities and privileges we have had. Some of these will go into\nheaven before those who have had great light but have not lived up\nto the light.\n166 Evangelism\nIf we wish to convince unbelievers that we have the truth that\nsanctifies the soul and transforms the character, we must not vehe-\nmently charge them with their errors. Thus we force them to the\nconclusion that the truth does not make us kind and courteous, but\ncoarse and rough.\nSome, easily excited, are always ready to take up the weapons of\nwarfare. In times of trial they will show that they have not founded\ntheir faith on the solid rock....\nLet Seventh-day Adventists do nothing that will mark them as\nlawless and disobedient. Let them keep all inconsistency out of their\nlives. Our work is to proclaim the truth, leaving the issues with the\nLord.\nDo all in your power to reflect the light, but do not speak words\nthat will irritate or provoke.\u2014Manuscript 117a, 1901.\nPresenting Truth in Fierce Way \u2014In the past you have pre-\nsented the truth in a fierce way, using it as if it were a scourge. This\nhas not glorified the Lord. You have given the people the rich trea-[174]\nsures of God\u2019s Word, but your manner has been so condemnatory\nthat they have turned from them. You have not taught the truth in\nthe way that Christ taught it. You present it in a way that mars its\ninfluence.... Your heart needs to be filled with the converting grace\nof Christ.\u2014Letter 164, 1902.\nPresent the Truth Tenderly\u2014Let every minister learn to wear\nthe gospel shoes. He who is shod with the preparation of the gospel\nof peace will walk as Christ walked. He will be able to speak right\nwords, and to speak them in love. He will not try to drive home God\u2019s\nmessage of truth. He will deal tenderly with every heart, realizing\nthat the Spirit will impress the truth on those who are susceptible to\ndivine impressions. Never will he be vehement in his manner. Every\nword spoken will have a softening, subduing influence....\nIn speaking words of reproof, let us put all the Christlike ten-\nderness and love possible into the voice. The higher a minister\u2019s\nposition, the more circumspect should he be in word and act.\u2014\nManuscript 127, 1902.\nReclaim Rather Than Condemn \u2014All whose hearts are in\nsympathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to reclaim, and\nnot to condemn. Christ dwelling in the soul is a spring that never\nSpirit and Manner of Presenting the Message 167\nruns dry. Where He abides, there will be an overflowing of benefi-\ncence.\u2014Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, 39 (1896).\nThe Evangelistic Sermon\nSimple Speech; Clarity of Expression\u2014The Lord wishes you\nto learn how to use the gospel net. Many need to learn this art. In\norder for you to be successful in your work, the meshes of your net\u2014[175]\nthe application of the Scriptures\u2014must be close, and the meaning\neasily discerned. Then make the most of drawing in the net. Come\nright to the point. Make your illustrations self-evident. However\ngreat a man\u2019s knowledge, it is of no avail unless he is able to com-\nmunicate it to others. Let the pathos of your voice, its deep feeling,\nmake its impression on hearts. Urge your students to surrender\nthemselves to God....\nMake your explanations clear; for I know that there are many\nwho do not understand many of the things said to them. Let the Holy\nSpirit mold and fashion your speech, cleansing it from all dross.\nSpeak as to little children, remembering that there are many well\nadvanced in years who are but little children in understanding.\nBy earnest prayer and diligent effort we are to obtain a fitness\nfor speaking. This fitness includes uttering every syllable clearly,\nplacing the force and emphasis where it belongs. Speak slowly.\nMany speak rapidly, hurrying one word after another so fast that the\neffect of what they say is lost. Into what you say put the spirit and\nlife of Christ.... To those who hear, the gospel is made the power of\nGod unto salvation. Present the gospel in its simplicity.\u2014Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Students, 253-255 (1913).\nAttention to Sermon Preparation\u2014The discourses given upon\npresent truth are full of important matter, and if these discourses are\ncarefully considered before being presented to the people, if they\nare condensed and do not cover too much ground, if the spirit of the\nMaster goes with the utterances, no one will be left in darkness, no\none will have cause to complain of being unfed. The preparation,\nboth in preacher and hearer, has very much to do with the result.\nI will here quote a few words that have come under my notice[176]\njust now: \u201cI always know by the length of Cannon\u2019s sermon whether\n168\nEvangelistic Sermon 169\nhe has been much from home during the week,\u201d said one of his flock.\n\u201cWhen carefully studied, his discourses are of a moderate length,\nbut it is almost impossible for his hearers to forget the teachings\nconveyed in them. When he has had no time for preparation, his\nsermons are unreasonably long, and it is equally impossible to get\nanything out of them which will stick to the memory.\u201d\nAnother able minister was asked how long he was accustomed\nto preach. \u201cWhen I prepare thoroughly, half an hour; when only\npartially, an hour; but when I enter the pulpit without previous\npreparation, I go on for any length of time you like; in fact, I never\nknow when to stop.\u201d\nHere is another forcible statement: \u201cA good shepherd,\u201d says a\nwriter, \u201cshould always have abundance of bread in his scrip, and\nhis dog under command. The dog is his zeal, which he must lead,\norder, and moderate. His scrip full of bread is his mind full of useful\nknowledge, and he should ever be in readiness to give nourishment\nto his flock.\u201d\u2014Letter 47, 1886.\nGuard Spiritual Digestion\u2014\u201cI do not like to go much beyond\nthe half hour,\u201d said a faithful and earnest preacher, who certainly\nnever gave to his hearers that which cost him nothing in the prepara-\ntion. \u201cI know that the spiritual digestion of some is but weak, and\nI should be sorry for my hearers to spend the second half hour in\nforgetting what I had said in the first, or in wishing that I would cease\nwhen I had given them as much as they could carry away.\u201d\u2014Letter\n47, 1886.\nCut Down Your Lengthy Discourses\u2014Some of your lengthy\ndiscourses would have far better effect upon the people if cut up [177]\ninto three. The people cannot digest so much; their minds cannot\neven grasp it, and they become wearied and confused by having so\nmuch matter brought before them in one discourse. Two thirds of\nsuch long discourses are lost, and the preacher is exhausted. There\nare many of our ministers who err in this respect. The result upon\nthem is not good; for they become brain weary and feel that they are\ncarrying heavy loads for the Lord and having a hard time....\nThe truth is so different in character and work from the errors\npreached from popular pulpits that when it is brought before the\npeople for the first time, it almost overwhelms them. It is strong meat\nand should be dealt out judiciously. While some minds are quick\n170 Evangelism\nto catch an idea, others are slow to comprehend new and startling\ntruths which involve great changes and present a cross at every step.\nGive them time to digest the wonderful truths of the message you\nbear them.\nThe preacher should endeavor to carry the understanding and\nsympathies of the people with them. Do not soar too high, where\nthey cannot follow, but give the truth point after point, slowly and\ndistinctly, making a few essential points, then it will be as a nail fas-\ntened in a sure place by the Master of assemblies. If you stop when\nyou should, giving them no more at once than they can comprehend\nand profit by, they will be eager to hear more, and thus the interest\nwill be sustained.\u2014Letter 39, 1887.\nReputation of Being an Interesting Speaker \u2014Put into your\nwork all the enthusiasm that you can. Let your discourses be short.\nThere are two reasons why you should do this. One is that you may\ngain the reputation of being an interesting speaker. Another is that[178]\nyou may preserve your health.\u2014Letter 112, 1902.\nSermons With Fresh Ideas\u2014Never weary the hearers by long\ndiscourses. This is not wise. For many years I have been laboring\non this point, seeking to have our brethren sermonize less, and\ndevote their time and strength to making important points of truth\nplain, for every point will be assailed by our opponents. Everyone\nconnected with the work should keep fresh ideas; ... and by tact and\nforesight bring all that is possible into your work to interest your\nhearers.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nApply Truth to Heart \u2014In every address given, let there be\nan application of truth to the heart, that whosoever may hear shall\nunderstand, and that men, women, and youth may become alive unto\nGod.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 258 (1896).\nEasy to Comprehend\u2014Preach the Word so that it will be easy\nto comprehend. Bring the people right to Jesus Christ, in whom their\nhopes of eternal life are centered.... As you bring to them the Word\nof God, presenting it in a simple style, the seed will grow, and after\na time you will have a harvest. The seed sowing is your work; the\npropagation of the seed is the Lord\u2019s divine work.\u2014Letter 34, 1896.\nPractical Godliness in Every Discourse\u2014It is harder to reach\nthe hearts of men today than it was twenty years ago. The most\nconvincing arguments may be presented, and yet sinners seem as\nEvangelistic Sermon 171\nfar from salvation as ever. Ministers should not preach sermon after\nsermon on doctrinal subjects alone. Practical Godliness should find\na place in every discourse.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 23, 1908.\nPreach Realties of the Message\u2014On a certain occasion, when [179]\nBetterton, the celebrated actor, was dining with Dr. Sheldon, Arch-\nbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop said to him, \u201cPray, Mr. Bet-\nterton, tell me why it is that you actors affect your audiences so\npowerfully by speaking of things imaginary.\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d replied\nBetterton, \u201cwith due submission to Your Grace, permit me to say\nthat the reason is plain; it all lies in the power of enthusiasm. We on\nthe stage speak of things imaginary as if they were real; and you in\nthe pulpit speak of things real as if they were imaginary.\u201d\u2014Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Students, 255 (1913).\nNo Compromise\u2014We are not to cringe and beg pardon of the\nworld for telling them the truth: we should scorn concealment.\nUnfurl your colors to meet the cause of men and angels. Let it be\nunderstood that Seventh-day Adventists can make no compromise.\nIn your opinions and faith there must not be the least appearance\nof waverings: the world has a right to know what to expect of us.\u2014\nManuscript 16, 1890.\nOur World-wide Message\u2014We are one in faith in the funda-\nmental truths of God\u2019s Word.... We have a world-wide message. The\ncommandments of God and the testimonies of Jesus Christ are the\nburden of our work.\u2014Letter 37, 1887.\nPreaching for a Revival \u2014Repent, repent, was the message\nrung out by John the Baptist in the wilderness. Christ\u2019s message\nto the people was, \u201cExcept ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\u201d\nLuke 13:5. And the apostles were commanded to preach everywhere\nthat men should repent.\nThe Lord desires His servants today to preach the old gospel\ndoctrine, sorrow for sin, repentance, and confession. We want old-\nfashioned sermons, old-fashioned customs, old-fashioned fathers [180]\nand mothers in Israel. The sinner must be labored for, perseveringly,\nearnestly, wisely, until he shall see that he is a transgressor of God\u2019s\nlaw, and shall exercise repentance toward God and faith toward the\nLord Jesus Christ.\u2014Manuscript 82, 1894.\nComforting, Powerful Preaching \u2014You should have a clear\napprehension of the gospel. The religious life is not one of gloom\n172 Evangelism\nand of sadness but of peace and joy coupled with Christlike dignity\nand holy solemnity. We are not encouraged by our Saviour to cherish\ndoubts and fears and distressing forebodings; these bring no relief\nto the soul and should be rebuked rather than praised. We may have\njoy unspeakable and full of glory. Let us put away our indolence\nand study God\u2019s Word more constantly. If we ever needed the Holy\nGhost to be with us, if we ever needed to preach in the demonstration\nof the Spirit, it is at this very time.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1888.\nA Cheerful Present-Truth Message\u2014Now, just now, we are\nto proclaim present truth, with assurance and with power. Do not\nstrike one dolorous note; do not sing funeral hymns.\u2014Letter 311,\n1905.\nHow to Preach on Calamities\u2014Uplift those who are cast down.\nTreat of calamities as disguised blessings, of woes as mercies. Work\nin a way that will cause hope to spring up in the place of despair.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 7:272 (1902).\nHurry Produces Tame Discourses\u2014When you hurry from one\nthing to another, when you have so much to do that you cannot take\ntime to talk with God, how can you expect power in your work? The\nreason so many of our ministers preach tame, lifeless discourses is\nthat they allow a variety of things of a worldly nature to take their[181]\ntime and attention.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:251 (1902).\nAvoid Sickly Discourses\u2014Short, plainly made points, avoiding\nall rambling, will be of the greatest advantage. God would not have\nyou exhaust your energies before you come into the meeting, either\nin writing or in any other employment, for when you come with a\ntired mind you give a very imperfect discourse to the people. Put\nyour freshest energies into the work and let not the slightest dullness\nof imperfectness be seen in any of your efforts.\nIf from any cause you are tired and exhausted, for Christ\u2019s sake\ndo not attempt to give a discourse. Let another who is not thus\nexhausted speak, short, to the point, or else have a Bible reading;\nanything but sickly discourses. These will do less harm where all\nare believers, but when the truth is to be proclaimed before a people\nwho are not in the faith, the speaker must prepare himself for the\ntask. He must not ramble all through the Bible but give a clear,\nconnected discourse, showing that he understands the points he\nwould make.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nEvangelistic Sermon 173\nArtificial Embellishments\u2014God calls upon the ministers of\nthe gospel not to seek to stretch themselves beyond their measure\nby bringing forward artificial embellishments, striving for the praise\nand applause of men, being ambitious for a vain show of intellect\nand eloquence. Let the minister\u2019s ambition be carefully to search\nthe Bible, that they may know as much as possible of God and of\nJesus Christ, whom He has sent. The more clearly ministers discern\nChrist, and catch His spirit, the more forcibly will they preach the\nsimple truth of which Christ is the center.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMarch 24, 1896.\n\u201cEloquent\u201d Sermons\u2014The minister may make a high range [182]\ninto the heavens, by poetical descriptions and fanciful presentations\nwhich please the senses and feed the imagination, but which do not\ntouch the common life experience, the daily necessities; bringing\nhome to the heart the very truths which are of vital interest. The\nimmediate requirements, the present trials, need present help and\nstrength\u2014the faith that works by love and purifies the soul, not\nwords which have no real influence upon the living daily walk in\npractical Christianity.\nThe minister may think that with his fanciful eloquence he has\ndone great things in feeding the flock of God; the hearers may\nsuppose that they never before heard such beautiful themes, they\nhave never seen the truth dressed up in such beautiful language,\nand as God was represented before them in His greatness, they felt\na glow of emotion. But trace from cause to effect all this ecstasy\nof feeling caused by these fanciful representations. There may be\ntruths, but too often they are not the food that will fortify them for\nthe daily battles of life.\u2014Manuscript 59, 1900.\nIntroducing Side Issues\u2014Brethren should not feel that it is a\nvirtue to stand apart because they do not see all minor points in\nexactly the same light. If they agree on fundamental truths, they\nshould not differ and dispute about matters of little real importance.\nTo dwell on perplexing questions, that after all are of no vital conse-\nquence, tends to call the mind away from truths vital to the saving of\nthe soul. Brethren should be very modest in urging these side issues\nwhich often they do not themselves understand, points that they do\nnot know to be truth and that are not essential to salvation....\nI have been shown that it is the device of the enemy to divert [183]\n174 Evangelism\nmen\u2019s minds to some obscure or unimportant point, something that\nis not fully revealed or is not essential to salvation. This is made\nthe absorbing theme, the \u201cpresent truth,\u201d when all the investigations\nand suppositions only serve to make matters more obscure and to\nconfuse the minds of some who ought to be seeking for oneness\nthrough sanctification of the truth.\u2014Manuscript 82, 1894.\nPreach Testing Truths\u2014If we allow the mind to take its own\ncourse, there will be countless points of difference which may be\ndebated by men who make Christ their hope, and who love the truth\nin sincerity, and yet who hold opposite opinions upon subjects that\nare not of real importance. These unsettled questions should not be\nbrought to the front, and urged publicly, but should, if held by any,\nbe done quietly and without controversy....\nA noble, devoted, spiritual worker will see in the great testing\ntruths that constitute the solemn message to be given to the world,\nsufficient reason for keeping all minor differences concealed, rather\nthan to bring them forth to become subjects of contention. Let the\nmind dwell upon the great work of redemption, the soon coming\nof Christ, and the commandments of God; and it will be found that\nthere is enough food for thought in these subjects to take up the\nentire attention.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 11, 1888.\nVoice in Sermon Delivery\u2014Preach short, govern your voice,\n[See also pp. 665-670, \u201cThe V oice of the Gospel Worker.\u201d] put all\nthe pathos and melody into it you can, and this terrible exhaustion\nthat is liable to come through long, protracted preaching will be\navoided....\nMuch of the effect of discourses is lost because of the manner\nin which they are delivered. The speaker frequently forgets that he\nis God\u2019s messenger, and that Christ and angels are in his audience[184]\nas listeners. His voice should not be raised to a high key, shouting\nout the truth as through a trumpet; for this is more nervous power\nthan the calm spirit and power of the Holy Ghost. Jesus, the greatest\nTeacher the world ever knew, was calm, earnest, and impressive in\nHis discourses. He is our example in all things.\u2014Letter 47, 1886.\nViolent Gesticulations\u2014The Lord calls upon you to make de-\ncided improvement in your manner of presenting the truth. You need\nnot to be sensational. Preach the Word, as Christ, the Son of God,\npreached the Word. Violent gesticulations detract greatly from the\nEvangelistic Sermon 175\nimpressions the truth would make upon human hearts, and lessen\nthe force of the demonstrations of the Spirit of God. They efface the\nsolemn impressions regarding God\u2019s Word that holy angels desire\nshall be made upon minds....\nMy brother, the Lord has given me a message for you. The\ngospel minister is engaged in a very solemn, sacred work. In every\nmeeting where the Word of God is taught, angels are present, and\nthose who conduct these meetings are to labor with such solemnity\nas Christ manifested in His teachings. The right mold must be placed\nupon every presentation of Bible truth.\u2014Letter 366, 1906.\nChrist the Center of the Message\nJesus Christ the Great Center of Attraction \u2014The third an-\ngel\u2019s message calls for the presentation of the Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment, and this truth must be brought before the world; but\nthe great Center of attraction, Jesus Christ, must not be left out of\nthe third angel\u2019s message....\nThe sinner must ever look toward Calvary; and with the simple[185]\nfaith of a little child, he must rest in the merits of Christ, accepting\nHis righteousness and believing in His mercy. Laborers in the cause\nof truth should present the righteousness of Christ.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, March 20, 1894.\nLift Up Christ\u2014Christ crucified, Christ risen, Christ ascended\ninto the heavens, Christ coming again, should so soften, gladden,\nand fill the mind of the minister that he will present these truths to\nthe people in love and deep earnestness. The minister will then be\nlost sight of, and Jesus will be made manifest.\nLift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up in sermon,\nin song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to pointing souls,\nconfused, bewildered, lost, to \u201cthe Lamb of God.\u201d Lift Him up, the\nrisen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who \u201chath loved\nus, and hath given Himself for us.\u201d Let the science of salvation be the\nburden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be poured\nforth in every supplication. Bring nothing into your preaching to\nsupplement Christ, the wisdom and power of God. Hold forth the\nword of life, presenting Jesus as the hope of the penitent and the\nstronghold of every believer. Reveal the way of peace to the troubled\nand the despondent, and show forth the grace and completeness of\nthe Saviour.\u2014Gospel Workers, 159, 160 (1915).\nIn Every Discourse\u2014More people than we think are longing to\nfind the way to Christ. Those who preach the last message of mercy\nshould bear in mind that Christ is to be exalted as the sinner\u2019s refuge.\nSome ministers think that it is not necessary to preach repentance and\nfaith; they take it for granted that their hearers are acquainted with\n176\nChrist the Center of the Message 177\nthe gospel, and that matters of a different nature must be presented [186]\nin order to hold their attention. But many people are sadly ignorant\nin regard to the plan of salvation; they need more instruction upon\nthis all-important subject than upon any other.\nTheoretical discourses are essential, that people may see the\nchain of truth, link after link, uniting in a perfect whole; but no\ndiscourse should ever be preached without presenting Christ and\nHim crucified as the foundation of the gospel. Ministers would reach\nmore hearts if they would dwell more upon practical godliness.\u2014\nGospel Workers, 158, 159 (1915).\nPreaching Christ From Experience\u2014It should be the burden\nof every messenger to set forth the fullness of Christ. When the\nfree gift of Christ\u2019s righteousness is not presented, the discourses\nare dry and spiritless; the sheep and the lambs are not fed. Said\nPaul, \u201cMy speech and my preaching was not with enticing words\nof man\u2019s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.\u201d\nThere is marrow and fatness in the gospel. Jesus is the living center\nof everything. Put Christ into every sermon. Let the preciousness,\nmercy, and glory of Jesus Christ be dwelt upon until Christ is formed\nwithin, the hope of glory....\nLet us gather together that which our own experience has re-\nvealed to us of the preciousness of Christ, and present it to others\nas a precious gem that sparkles and shines. Thus will the sinner be\nattracted to Him who is represented as the Chief among ten thousand\nand the One altogether lovely. The cross of Calvary is a pledge to us\nof everlasting life. Faith in Christ means everything to the sincere\nbeliever. The merits of Jesus blot out transgressions, and clothe us\nwith the robe of righteousness woven in the loom of heaven. The\ncrown of life is presented before us as the honor to be given at the [187]\nend of the conflict. These precious truths are to be set forth in living\ncharacters.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 19, 1895.\nThe Themes for Our Discourses \u2014These are our themes\u2014\nChrist crucified for our sins, Christ risen from the dead, Christ\nour intercessor before God; and closely connected with these is the\noffice work of the Holy Spirit, the representative of Christ, sent forth\nwith divine power and gifts for men.\u2014Letter 86, 1895.\nHis pre-existence, [See also pp. 613-617, \u201cMisrepresentations\nof the Godhead.\u201d] His coming the second time in glory and power,\n178 Evangelism\nHis personal dignity, His holy law uplifted, are the themes that have\nbeen dwelt upon with simplicity and power.\u2014Letter 83, 1895.\nAffirmative Message\u2014Bear with a certain voice an affirmative\nmessage. Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and still higher.\nThere is power in the exaltation of the cross of Christ....\nChrist is to be preached, not controversially, but affirmatively.\nTake your stand without controversy. Let not your words at any time\nbe uncertain. The Word of the living God is to be the foundation of\nour faith. Gather up the strongest affirmative statements regarding\nthe atonement made by Christ for the sins of the world. Show the\nnecessity for this atonement and tell men and women that they may\nbe saved if they will repent and return to their loyalty to God\u2019s law.\nGather all the affirmatives and proofs that make the gospel the glad\ntidings of salvation to all who receive and believe on Christ as a\npersonal Saviour.\u2014Letter 65, 1905.\nSermon Like the Offering of Cain \u2014Many of our ministers\nhave merely sermonized, presenting subjects in an argumentative\nway, and scarcely mentioning the saving power of the Redeemer.[188]\nTheir testimony was destitute of the saving blood of Christ. Their\noffering resembled the offering of Cain. He brought to the Lord\nthe fruit of the ground, which in itself was acceptable in God\u2019s\nsight. Very good indeed was the fruit; but the virtue of the offering\u2014\nthe blood of the slain lamb, representing the blood of Christ\u2014was\nlacking. So it is with Christless sermons. By them men are not\npricked to the heart; they are not led to inquire, What must I do to be\nsaved? Of all professing Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should\nbe foremost in uplifting Christ before the world.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n156 (1915).\nIn a Clear, Simple Manner \u2014Ministers need to have a more\nclear, simple manner in presenting the truth as it is in Jesus. Their\nown minds need to comprehend the great plan of salvation more\nfully. Then they can carry the minds of the hearers away from\nearthly things to the spiritual and eternal. There are many who want\nto know what they must do to be saved. They want a plain and clear\nexplanation of the steps requisite in conversion, and there should not\na sermon be given unless a portion of that discourse is to especially\nmake plain the way that sinners may come to Christ and be saved.\nThey should point them to Christ, as did John and with touching\nChrist the Center of the Message 179\nsimplicity, their hearts aglow with the love of Christ, say, \u201cBehold\nthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\u201d Strong\nand earnest appeals should be made to the sinner to repent and be\nconverted.\u2014The Review and Herald, February 22, 1887.\nThe Truth as It Is in Jesus \u2014Teach the simple lessons given\nby Christ. Tell the story of His life of self-denial and sacrifice, His\nhumiliation and death, His resurrection and ascension, His interces-\nsion for sinners in the courts above. In every congregation there are [189]\nsouls upon whom the Spirit of the Lord is moving. Help them to\nunderstand what is truth; break the bread of life to them; call their\nattention to vital questions.\nMany voices are advocating error; let your voice advocate truth.\nPresent subjects that will be as green pastures to the sheep of God\u2019s\nfold. Do not lead your hearers into waste tracts, where they will be\nno nearer the fountain of living water than they were before hearing\nyou. Present the truth as it is in Jesus, making plain the requirements\nof the law and the gospel. Present Christ, the way, the truth, and the\nlife, and tell of His power to save all who come to Him. The Captain\nof our salvation is interceding for His people, not as a petitioner to\nmove the Father to compassion, but as a conqueror, who claims the\ntrophies of His victory. He is able to save to the uttermost all who\ncome to God by Him. Make this fact very plain.\nUnless ministers are guarded, they will hide the truth under\nhuman ornamentation. Let no minister suppose that he can convert\nsouls by eloquent sermons. Those who teach others should plead\nwith God to imbue them with His Spirit, and enable them to lift\nup Christ as the sinner\u2019s only hope. Flowery speeches, pleasing\ntales, or inappropriate anecdotes do not convict the sinner. Men\nlisten to such words as they would to a pleasant song. The message\nthat the sinner should hear is, \u201cGod so loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d\u2014Gospel Workers, 154, 155\n(1915).\nChrist\u2019s Love Uplifted\u2014In order to break down the barriers of\nprejudice and impenitence, the love of Christ must have a part in\nevery discourse. Make men to know how much Jesus loves them, [190]\nand what evidences He has given them of His love. What love can\nequal that which God has manifested for man, by the death of Christ\n180 Evangelism\non the cross? When the heart is filled with the love of Jesus, this\ncan be presented to the people, and it will affect hearts.\u2014Letter 48,\n1886.\nThe Cross Foundation of Every Discourse\u2014The sacrifice of\nChrist as an atonement for sin is the great truth around which all\nother truths cluster. In order to be rightly understood and appreci-\nated, every truth in the Word of God, from Genesis to Revelation,\nmust be studied in the light that streams from the cross of Calvary. I\npresent before you the great, grand monument of mercy and regen-\neration, salvation and redemption\u2014the Son of God uplifted on the\ncross. This is to be the foundation of every discourse given by our\nministers.\u2014Gospel Workers, 315 (1915).\nChrist and His Righteousness\u2014Christ and His righteousness\u2014\nlet this be our platform, the very life of our faith.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, August 31, 1905.\nThe Third Angel\u2019s Message in Verity\u2014Several have written\nto me, inquiring if the message of justification by faith is the third an-\ngel\u2019s message, and I have answered, \u201cIt is the third angel\u2019s message\nin verity.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, April 1, 1890.\nIt Presents an Uplifted Saviour\u2014This message was to bring\nmore prominently before the world the uplifted Saviour, the sacrifice\nfor the sins of the whole world. It presented justification through\nfaith in the Surety; it invited the people to receive the righteousness\nof Christ, which is made manifest in obedience to all the command-\nments of God. Many had lost sight of Jesus. They needed to have\ntheir eyes directed to His divine person, His merits, and His change-\nless love for the human family. All power is given into His hands,[191]\nthat He may dispense rich gifts unto men, imparting the priceless\ngift of His own righteousness to the helpless human agent. This is\nthe message that God commanded to be given to the world. It is the\nthird angel\u2019s message, which is to be proclaimed with a loud voice,\nand attended with the outpouring of His Spirit in a large measure.\nThe uplifted Saviour is to appear in His efficacious work as\nthe Lamb slain, sitting upon the throne, to dispense the priceless\ncovenant blessings, the benefits He died to purchase for every soul\nwho should believe on Him. John could not express that love in\nwords; it was too deep, too broad; he calls upon the human family\nto behold it. Christ is pleading for the church in the heavenly courts\nChrist the Center of the Message 181\nabove, pleading for those for whom He paid the redemption price of\nHis own lifeblood. Centuries, ages, can never diminish the efficacy\nof this atoning sacrifice. The message of the gospel of His grace was\nto be given to the church in clear and distinct lines, that the world\nshould no longer say that Seventh-day Adventists talk the law, the\nlaw, but do not teach or believe Christ.\nThe efficacy of the blood of Christ was to be presented to the\npeople with freshness and power, that their faith might lay hold upon\nits merits....\nFor years the church has been looking to man, and expecting\nmuch from man, but not looking to Jesus, in whom our hopes of\neternal life are centered. Therefore God gave to His servants a\ntestimony that presented the truth as it is in Jesus, which is the third\nangel\u2019s message, in clear, distinct lines.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers\nand Gospel Workers, 91-93 (1896).\nChrist vs. Penance \u2014When the third angel\u2019s message is\npreached as it should be, power attends its proclamation, and it be- [192]\ncomes an abiding influence. It must be attended with divine power,\nor it will accomplish nothing....\nPenances, mortifications of the flesh, constant confession of sin,\nwithout sincere repentance; fasts, festivals, and outward observances,\nunaccompanied by true devotion\u2014all these are of no value whatever.\nThe sacrifice of Christ is sufficient; He made a whole, efficacious\noffering to God; and human effort without the merit of Christ, is\nworthless....\nThe plan of salvation is not understood to be that through which\ndivine power is brought to man in order that his human effort may\nbe wholly successful....\nWithout the transforming process which can come alone through\ndivine power, the original propensities to sin are left in the heart in\nall their strength, to forge new chains, to impose a slavery that can\nnever be broken by human power.\u2014The Review and Herald, August\n19, 1890.\nA Present-Truth Message \u2014We thank the Lord with all the\nheart that we have precious light to present before the people, and\nwe rejoice that we have a message for this time which is present\ntruth. The tidings that Christ is our righteousness has brought relief\n182 Evangelism\nto many, many souls, and God says to His people, \u201cGo forward.\u201d\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, July 23, 1889.\nA Message for the Churches and New Fields\u2014Ministers are\nto present Christ in His fullness both in the churches and in new\nfields, that the hearers may have an intelligent faith. The people must\nbe instructed that Christ is unto them salvation and righteousness. It\nis Satan\u2019s studied purpose to keep souls from believing in Christ as\ntheir only hope; for the blood of Christ that cleanseth from all sin is\nefficacious in behalf of those only who believe in its merit.\u2014Gospel[193]\nWorkers, 162 (1915).\nSome Listening to the Last Sermon\u2014God would draw minds\nfrom the conviction of logic to a conviction deeper, purer, and more\nglorious. Often human logic has nearly quenched the light that God\nwould have shine forth in clear rays to convince men that the Lord\nof nature is worthy of all praise and glory, because He is the Creator\nof all things.\nSome ministers err in making their sermons wholly argumen-\ntative. There are those who listen to the theory of the truth, and\nare impressed with the evidences brought out; then, if Christ is pre-\nsented as the Saviour of the world, the seed sown may spring up\nand bear fruit to the glory of God. But often the cross of Calvary is\nnot presented before the people. Some may be listening to the last\nsermon they will ever hear, and the golden opportunity lost, is lost\nforever. If in connection with the theory of the truth, Christ and His\nredeeming love had been proclaimed, these might have been won to\nHis side.\u2014Gospel Workers, 157, 158 (1915).\nProphetic Preaching that Arrests Attention\nCall Attention to Prophecies\u2014The followers of Christ are to\ncombine in a strong effort to call the attention of the world to the\nfast-fulfilling prophecies of the Word of God.\u2014Manuscript 38, 1905.\nProphecy Alone Holds the Answer to the Questions of think-\ning People\u2014The prophecies which the great I AM has given in His\nWord, uniting link after link in the chain of events, from eternity\nin the past to eternity in the future, tell us where we are today in\nthe procession of the ages, and what may be expected in the time to [194]\ncome. All that prophecy has foretold as coming to pass, until the\npresent time, has been traced on the pages of history, and we may\nbe assured that all which is yet to come will be fulfilled in its order.\nToday the signs of the times declare that we are standing on the\nthreshold of great and solemn events. Everything in our world is\nin agitation. Before our eyes is fulfilling the Saviour\u2019s prophecy\nof the events to precede His coming: \u201cYe shall hear of wars and\nrumors of wars.... Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom\nagainst kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and\nearthquakes, in divers places.\u201d\nThe present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living.\nRulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and au-\nthority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention\nfixed upon the events taking place about us. They are watching the\nrelations that exist among the nations. They observe the intensity\nthat is taking possession of every earthly element, and they recognize\nthat something great and decisive is about to take place,\u2014that the\nworld is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.\nThe Bible, and the Bible only, gives a correct view of these\nthings. Here are revealed the great final scenes in the history of\nour world, events that already are casting their shadows before, the\nsound of their approach causing the earth to tremble, and men\u2019s\nhearts to fail them for fear.\u2014Prophets and Kings, 536, 537 (1916).\n183\n184 Evangelism\nGive the Trumpet a Certain Sound\u2014There are many who do\nnot understand the prophecies relating to these days, and they must\nbe enlightened. It is the duty of both watchmen and laymen to give[195]\nthe trumpet a certain sound. Be in earnest, \u201ccry aloud, spare not, lift\nup thy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\nCrowd in Clear-cut Prophetic Truths\u2014The perils of the last\ndays are upon us, and in our work we are to warn the people of\nthe danger they are in. Let not the solemn scenes which prophecy\nhas revealed, be left untouched. If our people were half awake, if\nthey realized the nearness of the events portrayed in the Revelation,\na reformation would be wrought in our churches, and many more\nwould believe the message.\nWe have no time to lose; God calls upon us to watch for souls\nas they that must give an account. Advance new principles, and\ncrowd in the clear-cut truth. It will be as a sword cutting both ways.\nBut be not too ready to take a controversial attitude. There will be\ntimes when we must stand still and see the salvation of God. Let\nDaniel speak, let the Revelation speak, and tell what is truth. But\nwhatever phase of the subject is presented, uplift Jesus as the center\nof all hope, \u201cthe Root and the Offspring of David, and the bright and\nmorning Star.\u201d\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 118\n(1896).\nIn a Fresh, Impressive Way\u2014Do not let the teaching be done\nin a dry, abstract way, which has been the manner of teaching in\ntoo many cases, but present the truths of God\u2019s Word in a fresh,\nimpressive way....\nThe book of Revelation must be opened to the people. Many\nhave been taught that it is a sealed book; but it is sealed only to those\nwho reject light and truth. The truth it contains must be proclaimed,\nthat people may have an opportunity to prepare for the events which[196]\nare so soon to transpire. The third angel\u2019s message must be presented\nas the only hope for the salvation of a perishing world.\u2014Letter 87,\n1896.\nThree Messages Important \u2014The theme of greatest impor-\ntance is the third angel\u2019s message, embracing the messages of the\nfirst and second angels. All should understand the truths contained\nin these messages and demonstrate them in daily life, for this is\nProphetic Preaching that Arrests Attention 185\nessential to salvation. We shall have to study earnestly, prayerfully,\nin order to understand these grand truths; and our power to learn and\ncomprehend will be taxed to the utmost.\u2014Letter 97, 1902.\nProphecy the Foundation of Our Faith \u2014Ministers should\npresent the sure word of prophecy as the foundation of the faith\nof Seventh-day Adventists. The prophecies of Daniel and the Reve-\nlation should be carefully studied, and in connection with them the\nwords, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the\nworld.\u201d\nThe twenty-fourth chapter of Matthew is presented to me again\nand again as something that is to be brought to the attention of all.\nWe are today living in the time when the predictions of this chapter\nare fulfilling. Let our ministers and teachers explain these prophecies\nto those whom they instruct. Let them leave out of their discourses\nmatters of minor consequence, and present the truths that will decide\nthe destiny of souls.\u2014Gospel Workers, 148 (1915).\nTruths That Concern All Living Today\u2014We are to proclaim\nto the world the great and solemn truths of Revelation. Into the very\ndesigns and principles of the church of God these truths are to enter.\nA benediction is pronounced upon those who pay due regard to this\ncommunication. The blessing is promised to encourage a study of [197]\nthis book. We are by no means to become weary of looking into\nit because of its apparently mystical symbols. Christ can give us\nunderstanding....\nThere should be a closer and more diligent study of the Revela-\ntion, and a more earnest presentation of the truths it contains\u2014truths\nwhich concern all who are living in these last days.\u2014Manuscript\n105, 1902.\nA Message for the Whole World\u2014The vision that Christ pre-\nsented to John, presenting the commandments of God and the faith\nof Jesus, is to be definitely proclaimed to all nations, people, and\ntongues. The churches, represented by Babylon, are represented\nas having fallen from their spiritual state to become a persecuting\npower against those who keep the commandments of God and have\nthe testimony of Jesus Christ. To John this persecuting power is\nrepresented as having horns like a lamb, but as speaking like a\ndragon.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 117 (1896).\n186 Evangelism\nReceiving Congregational Response \u2014Brother -----\u2019s meet-\nings were largely attended, and the people listened to his words\nwith spellbound interest; the interest continued from first to last.\nWith his Bible in his hand, and basing all his arguments on the\nWord of God, Brother -----traced out before them the prophecies\nof Daniel and Revelation. His own words were few; he made the\nScriptures themselves explain the truth to the people. After giving\nthem the truth, Elder -----would draw an expression of opinion from\nhis congregation. \u201cNow,\u201d he would say, \u201cthose who see the truth of\nwhat I am saying, raise your hands\u201d; and in response many hands\nwould be raised. I can only poorly represent to you the interest his\nwork has created.\u2014Letter 400, 1906.\nModern Attitude Toward Prophetic Truth \u2014As of old, the[198]\nplain testimony of God\u2019s Word was met with the inquiry, \u201cHave any\nof the rulers or of the Pharisees believed?\u201d And finding how difficult\na task it was to refute the arguments drawn from the prophetic\nperiods, many discouraged the study of the prophecies, teaching that\nthe prophetic books were sealed, and were not to be understood.\nMultitudes, trusting implicitly to their pastors, refused to listen to the\nwarning; and others, though convinced of the truth, dared not confess\nit, lest they should be \u201cput out of the synagogue.\u201d The message which\nGod had sent for the testing and purification of the church, revealed\nall too surely how great was the number who had set their affections\non this world rather than upon Christ. The ties which bound them\nto earth were stronger than the attractions heavenward. They chose\nto listen to the voice of worldly wisdom, and turned away from\nthe heartsearching message of truth.\u2014The Great Controversy, 380\n(1888).\nFamiliar With Every Line of Prophetic History\u2014Young men\nwho desire to give themselves to the ministry, or who have already\ndone so, should become familiar with every line of prophetic his-\ntory.\u2014Gospel Workers, 98 (1915).\nIncreased Light on the Prophecies\u2014Increased light will shine\nupon all the grand truths of prophecy, and they will be seen in\nfreshness and brilliancy, because the bright beams of the Sun of\nRighteousness will illuminate the whole.\nDo we believe that we are coming to the crisis, that we are living\nin the very last scenes of the earth\u2019s history? Will we now awaken\nProphetic Preaching that Arrests Attention 187\nand do the work which this time calls for, or will we wait till the\nthings which I have presented come upon us?\u2014Manuscript 18, 1888.\nProphecies Already Made Plain\u2014The Lord wants all to under- [199]\nstand His providential dealings now, just now, in the time in which\nwe live. There must be no long discussions, presenting new theo-\nries in regard to the prophecies which God has already made plain.\nNow the great work from which the mind should not be diverted is\nthe consideration of our personal safety in the sight of God. Are\nour feet on the rock of ages? Are we hiding ourselves in our only\nrefuge? The storm is coming, relentless in its fury. Are we prepared\nto meet it? Are we one with Christ as He is one with the Father?\nAre we heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ? Are we working in\ncopartnership with Christ?\u2014Manuscript 32a, 1896.\nTeach Lessons of Christ \u2014The apostle presents a solemn\ncharge to every minister of the gospel. He arrays them before God\nand the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead,\nto preach the Word, and they are not to show a partiality for merely\nthe prophecies and the argumentative portions of the Scriptures, but\nthe greatest and most important lessons that are given us are those\ngiven us by Jesus Christ Himself.\u2014Manuscript 13, 1888.\nRestraining Without Obscuring Truth\nStrongest Meat Not for Babes\u2014Let the truth be presented as\nit is in Jesus, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little,\nand there a little. Speak of the love of God in words easy to be\nunderstood. Bible truth, presented in the meekness and love of Jesus\nwill have a telling influence upon many minds.\nMany souls are hungering for the bread of life. Their cry is,[200]\n\u201cGive me bread; do not give me a stone. It is bread that I want.\u201d Feed\nthese perishing, starving souls. Let our ministers bear in mind that\nthe strongest meat is not to be given to babes who know not the first\nprinciples of the truth as we believe it. In every age the Lord has had\na special message for the people of that time; so we have a message\nfor the people in this age. But while we have many things to say,\nwe may be compelled to withhold some of them for a time, because\nthe people are not prepared to receive them now.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, October 14, 1902.\nPrepare the Soil Before Sowing the Seed \u2014In laboring in a\nnew field, do not think it your duty to say at once to the people,\nWe are Seventh-day Adventists; we believe that the seventh day is\nthe Sabbath; we believe in the nonimmortality of the soul. This\nwould often erect a formidable barrier between you and those you\nwish to reach. Speak to them, as you have opportunity, upon points\nof doctrine on which you can agree. Dwell on the necessity of\npractical godliness. Give them evidence that you are a Christian,\ndesiring peace, and that you love their souls. Let them see that you\nare conscientious. Thus you will gain their confidence; and there\nwill be time enough for doctrines. Let the heart be won, the soil\nprepared, and then sow the seed, presenting in love the truth as it is\nin Jesus.\u2014Gospel Workers, 119, 120 (1915).\nGuard Against Closing the Listeners\u2019 Ears\u2014Last night in my\nsleeping hours I seemed to be in meeting with my brethren, listening\nto One who spoke as having authority. He said: \u201cMany souls will\nattend this meeting who are honestly ignorant of the truths which will\n188\nRestraining Without Obscuring Truth 189\nbe presented before them. They will listen and become interested, [201]\nbecause Christ is drawing them. Conscience tells them that what\nthey hear is true, for it has the Bible for its foundation. The greatest\ncare is needed in dealing with these souls.\nDo not at the outset press before the people the most objection-\nable features of our faith, lest you close their ears to which these\nthings come as a new revelation. Let such portions of truth be dealt\nout to them as they may be able to grasp and appreciate; though it\nshould appear strange and startling, many will recognize with joy\nthe new light that is shed on the Word of God, whereas if truth were\npresented in so large a measure that they could not receive it, some\nwould go away, and never come again. More than this, they would\nmisrepresent the truth.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, February\n25, 1895.\nHere a Little, and There a Little \u2014Those who have been ed-\nucated in the truth by precept and example should make great al-\nlowance for others who have had no knowledge of the Scriptures\nexcept through the interpretations given by ministers and church\nmembers, and who have received traditions and fables as Bible truth.\nThey are surprised by the presentation of truth; it is as a new revela-\ntion to them, and they cannot bear to have all the truth, in its most\nstriking character, presented to them at the outset. All is new and\nstrange and wholly unlike that which they have heard from their min-\nisters, and they are inclined to believe what the ministers have told\nthem, that Seventh-day Adventists are infidels and do not believe\nthe Bible. Let the truth be presented as it is in Jesus, line upon line,\nprecept upon precept, here a little, and there a little.\u2014Manuscript\n95, 1894.\nTake One Point at a Time\u2014Teachers of the Word of God are\nnot to keep back any part of the counsel of God, lest the people [202]\nshall be ignorant of their duty and not understand what is the will\nof God concerning them, and stumble and fall into perdition. But\nwhile the teacher of truth should be faithful in presenting the gospel,\nlet him never pour out a mass of matter which the people cannot\ncomprehend because it is new to them and hard to understand. Take\none point at a time, and make that one point plain, speaking slowly\nand in a distinct voice. Speak in such a way that the people shall\nsee what is the relation of that one point to other truths of vital\n190 Evangelism\nimportance.... It will be difficult to create prejudice in the hearts\nof those who are seeking for truth as for hidden treasure, if the\nspeaker will hide himself in Christ; for he will then reveal Christ,\nnot himself.\u2014Manuscript 39, 1895.\nDwell on the Affirmative Truths\u2014Dwell not on the negative\npoints of questions that arise, but gather to your minds affirmative\ntruths, and fasten them there by much study and earnest prayer and\nheart consecration. Keep your lamps trimmed and burning; and let\nbright rays shine forth, that men, beholding your good works, may\nbe led to glorify your Father which is in heaven.\nThe Great Teacher held in His hand the entire map of truth,\nbut He did not disclose it all to His disciples. He opened to them\nthose subjects only which were essential for their advancement in\nthe path to heaven. There were many things in regard to which\nHis wisdom kept Him silent. As Christ withheld many things from\nHis first disciples, knowing that then it would be impossible for\nthem to comprehend them, so today he withholds many things from\nus, knowing the capacity of our understanding.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, April 23, 1908.\nTruth-Teaching Devices [203]\nChrist\u2019s Parables and Symbols \u2014We should seek to follow\nmore closely the example of Christ, the great Shepherd, as He\nworked with His little company of disciples, studying with them and\nwith the people the Old Testament Scriptures. His active ministry\nconsisted not merely in sermonizing but in educating the people. As\nHe passed through villages, He came in personal contact with the\npeople in their homes, teaching, and ministering to their necessities.\nAs the crowds that followed Him increased, when He came to a\nfavorable place, He would speak to them, simplifying His discourses\nby the use of parables and symbols.\u2014Letter 192, 1906.\nCharts Should Be Used \u2014You have given much study to the\nmatter of how to make the truth interesting, and the charts you have\nmade are in perfect accord with the work to be carried forward.\nThese charts are object lessons to the people. You have put intensity\nof thought into the work of getting out these striking illustrations.\nAnd they have a marked effect as they are presented to the people\nin vindication of truth. The Lord uses them to impress minds. In-\nstruction has been given me clearly and distinctly that charts should\nbe used in the presentation of truth. And these illustrations should\nbe made still more impressive by words showing the importance of\nobedience.\u2014Letter 51, 1902.\nProphecies Taught by Simple, Inexpensive Charts\u2014The use\nof charts is most effective in explaining the prophecies relating to\nthe past, the present, and the future. But we are to make our work\nas simple and inexpensive as possible. The truth is to be explained\nin simplicity. In no case are we to follow the example of outward [204]\ndisplay set by the world.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1905.\nEffective Use of Appropriate Devices\u2014Elder S is now making\nan effort in Oakland.... He has pitched his tent in a central location\nand has secured a good hearing, better than we had expected.\nBrother S is an intelligent evangelist. He speaks with the sim-\nplicity of a child. Never does he bring any slur into his discourses.\n191\n192 Evangelism\nHe preaches directly from the Word, letting the Word speak to all\nclasses. His strong arguments are the words of the Old and the New\nTestaments. He does not seek for words that would merely impress\nthe people with his learning, but he endeavors to let the Word of\nGod speak to them directly in clear, distinct utterance. If any refuse\nto accept the message, they must reject the Word.\nBrother S dwells especially upon the prophecies in the books\nof Daniel and the Revelation. He has large representations of the\nbeasts spoken of in these books. These beasts are made of papier-\nmache, and by an ingenious invention, they may be brought at the\nproper time before the congregation. Thus he holds the attention\nof the people, while he preaches the truth to them. Through this\neffort hundreds will be led to a better understanding of the Bible\nthan they ever had before, and we trust that there will be many\nconversions.\u2014Letter 326, 1906.\nA Sound Pedagogical Principle\u2014The labors of Elder S remind\nme of the labors put forth in 1842 to 1844. He uses the Bible, and\nthe Bible alone, to prove the truth of his arguments. He presents a\nplain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Then if any oppose his words, he makes\nit plain that they must have their controversy not with him.\nHe has large lifelike representations of the beasts and symbols[205]\nin Daniel and the Revelation, and these are brought forward at the\nproper time to illustrate his remarks. Not one careless or unnecessary\nword escapes his lips. He speaks forcibly and solemnly. Many of his\nhearers have never before heard discourses of so solemn a nature.\nThey manifest no spirit of levity, but a solemn awe seems to rest\nupon them.\u2014Letter 350, 1906.\nCatholics Attracted by Symbols\u2014Elder S is arousing a good\ninterest by his meetings. People of all classes come out to hear, and\nto see the life-size images that he has of the beasts of Revelation. A\ngreat many Catholics come to hear him.\u2014Letter 352, 1906.\nMethods to Be Used in Closing Work\u2014I am pleased with the\nmanner in which our brother [Elder S] has used his ingenuity and\ntact in providing suitable illustrations for the subjects presented\u2014\nrepresentations that have a convincing power. Such methods will be\nused more and more in this closing work.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1906.\nYoung Men Study How to Present Symbolic Truth \u2014The\nLord has been working with Elder S, teaching him how to give\nTruth-Teaching Devices 193\nto the people this last warning message. His method of making the\nwords of the Bible prove the truth for this time, and his use of the\nsymbols presented in Revelation and Daniel, are effective. Let the\nyoung men learn as for their lives what is truth and how it should\nbe presented. We are living in the last days of the great conflict; the\ntruth alone will hold us securely in this time of trouble. The way\nshould be prepared for Elder S to give the message, and our young\nmen should attend his evening meetings.\u2014Letter 349, 1906.\nWorkers to Originate Devices\u2014Let the workers for God man- [206]\nifest tact and talent, and originate devices by which to communicate\nlight to those who are near and to those who are afar off.... Time has\nbeen lost, golden opportunities have been unimproved, because men\nhave lacked clear, spiritual eyesight, and have not been wise to plan\nand devise means and ways whereby they might preoccupy the field\nbefore the enemy had taken possession.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMarch 24, 1896.\nDevices to Teach, Not Entertain\u2014By the use of charts, sym-\nbols, and representations of various kinds, the minister can make the\ntruth stand out clearly and distinctly. This is a help, and in harmony\nwith the Word of God. But when the worker makes his labors so\nexpensive that others are unable to secure from the treasury sufficient\nmeans to support them in the field, he is not working in harmony\nwith God\u2019s plan.\nThe work in the large cities is to be done after Christ\u2019s order,\nnot after the order of a theatrical performance. It is not a theatrical\nperformance that glorifies God, but the presentation of the truth in\nthe love of Christ.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:142 (1909).\nStories, Anecdotes, Jesting, and Joking\n[See also pp. 641-644, \u201cAvoid Jesting And Joking.\u201d]\nAn Ambassador for Christ\u2014The minister of the gospel who\nis a laborer together with God, will learn daily in the school of\nChrist.... No light, trifling words will fall from his lips; for is he\nnot an ambassador for Christ, bearing a divine message to perishing\nsouls? All jesting and joking, all lightness and trifling, is painful[207]\nto the cross-bearing disciple of Christ. He is weighed down by the\nburden he feels for souls. Constantly his heart is drawn out in prayer\nto God for the gift of His grace, that he may be a faithful steward. He\nprays to be kept pure and holy, and then refuses to rush heedlessly\ninto temptation.\nHe heeds the injunction, \u201cAs He which hath called you is holy,\nso be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be\nye holy; for I am holy\u201d.... Keeping close to his Master, he receives\nwords from Him to speak to the people. Lifting as Christ lifts, loving\nas Christ loves, working as Christ works, he goes about doing good.\nHe strives with all his power for self-improvement, that by precept\nand example he may lead others to a purer, higher, nobler life.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, January 21, 1902.\nLeave a Solemn Impression \u2014Ministers are not to preach\nmen\u2019s opinions, not to relate anecdotes, get up theatrical perfor-\nmances, not to exhibit self; but as though they were in the presence\nof God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, they are to preach the Word.\nLet them not bring levity into the work of the ministry, but let them\npreach the Word in a manner that will leave a most solemn impres-\nsion upon those who hear.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 28,\n1897.\nImpress Strangers With Character of the Truth\u2014It is God\u2019s\nwill that all parts of His service shall be managed in an orderly,\nbecoming manner, which will impress those strangers who may\n194\nStories, Anecdotes, Jesting, and Joking 195\nattend, as well as the regular attendants, with the elevated, ennobling\ncharacter of the truth and its power to cleanse the heart.\nIn His providence God impresses people to attend our tent meet-\nings and church services. Some come from curiosity, others to\ncriticize or ridicule. Often they are convicted of sin. The word spo- [208]\nken in the spirit of love makes a lasting impression on them. How\ncarefully, then, should these meetings be conducted. The words\nspoken should be of authority, that the Holy Spirit can impress them\non minds. The speaker who is controlled by the Spirit of God has\na sacred dignity, and his words are a savor of life unto life. Let not\nunsuitable illustrations or anecdotes be introduced into the discourse.\nLet the words spoken be for the edification of the hearers.\u2014Letter\n19, 1901.\nThe Illustrations Christ Used \u2014His [Christ\u2019s] messages of\nmercy were varied to suit His audience. He knew \u201chow to speak a\nword in season to him that is weary\u201d; for grace was poured upon\nHis lips, that He might convey to men in the most attractive way the\ntreasures of truth. He had tact to meet the prejudiced minds, and\nsurprised them with illustrations that won their attention.\nThrough the imagination He reached the heart. His illustrations\nwere taken from the things of daily life, and although they were\nsimple, they had in them a wonderful depth of meaning. The birds\nof the air, the lilies of the field, the seed, the shepherd and the\nsheep,\u2014with these objects Christ illustrated immortal truth; and\never afterward, when His hearers chanced to see these things of\nnature, they recalled His words. Christ\u2019s illustrations constantly\nrepeated His lessons.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 254 (1898).\nDepreciating the Message\u2014We do not want to lose sight of the\npeculiar sacredness of this mission of ministering in word and in\ndoctrine to the people. It is the work of the minister to speak the\nwords of truth to the people, solemn, sacred truth. Some form the\nhabit of relating anecdotes in their discourses, which have a tendency\nto amuse and remove from the mind of the hearer the sacredness of [209]\nthe word which they are handling. Such should consider that they are\nnot giving to the people the word of the Lord. Too many illustrations\ndo not have a correct influence; they belittle the sacred dignity that\nshould ever be maintained in the presentation of the Word of God to\nthe people.\u2014The Review and Herald, February 22, 1887.\n196 Evangelism\nVery Cheap Fodder\u2014There are men who stand in the pulpits as\nshepherds, professing to feed the flock, while the sheep are starving\nfor the bread of life. There are long-drawn-out discourses, largely\nmade up of the relation of anecdotes; but the hearts of the hearers\nare not touched. The feelings of some may be moved, they may\nshed a few tears, but their hearts are not broken. The Lord Jesus has\nbeen present when they have been presenting that which was called\nsermons, but their words were destitute of the dew and rain of heaven.\nThey evidenced that the anointed ones described by Zechariah (see\nchapter 4) had not ministered to them that they might minister to\nothers. When the anointed ones empty themselves through the\ngolden pipes, the golden oil flows out of themselves into the golden\nbowls, to flow forth into the lamps, the churches. This is the work\nof every true, devoted servant of the living God. The Lord God of\nheaven cannot approve much that is brought into the pulpit by those\nwho are professedly speaking the word of the Lord. They do not\ninculcate ideas that will be a blessing to those who hear. There is\ncheap, very cheap fodder placed before the people.\u2014Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 336, 337 (1896).\nStrange Fire\u2014The object of your ministerial labors is not to\namuse. It is not to convey information alone, not merely to convince\nthe intellect. The preaching of the Word should appeal to the intellect\nand impart knowledge, but it comprises much more than this. The[210]\nheart of the minister must reach the hearts of the hearers. Some have\nadopted a style of preaching that does not have a right influence....\nThe minister is using strange fire when he mixes storytelling\nwith his discourses.... You have men of all classes of minds to\nmeet, and as you deal with the Sacred Word, you should manifest\nearnestness, respect, reverence. Let not the impression be made\nupon any mind that you are a cheap, surface speaker. Weed out\nstorytelling from your discourses. Preach the Word. You would\nhave had more sheaves to bring to the Master if you had constantly\npreached the Word. You little understand the soul\u2019s great need and\nlonging. Some are wrestling with doubt, almost in despair, almost\nhopeless....\nGod is offended when His representatives descend to the use of\ncheap, trifling words. The cause of truth is dishonored. Men judge\nStories, Anecdotes, Jesting, and Joking 197\nof the whole ministry by the man whom they hear, and the enemies\nof the truth will make the most of his errors.\u2014Letter 61, 1896.\nHungry for the Bread of Life\u2014Keep your stories to yourself.\nThe people are not soul-hungry for these, but they want the bread\nof life, the word that liveth and abideth forever. What is the chaff to\nthe wheat?\u2014Letter 61, 1896.\nBurden of Conviction Lost by Cheap Nonsense \u2014After a\ngood work has been done, the ones who have been awakened to\na sense of sin should be taught how to take hold of the arm of the\nLord. But if the good impressions made are not followed up with\ntrue, earnest efforts, no permanent good is accomplished. The result\nmight be very different, did not a desire for amusement divert the [211]\nmind from the contemplation of serious things....\nAmusement is not to be interwoven with instruction in the Scrip-\ntures. When this is done, the hearers, amused by some cheap non-\nsense, lose the burden of conviction. The opportunity passes away,\nand no one is drawn by the cords of love to the Saviour.\u2014Manuscript\n83, 1901.\nFree From Cheap, Common Expressions\u2014The messages of\ntruth are to be kept entirely free from cheap, common words of\nhuman devising. Thus forcible impressions will be made upon\nhearts. Let not our ministers cherish the idea that they must bring\nforth something new and strange, or that cheap, common expressions\nwill give them influence. Ministers are to be the mouthpiece of God,\nand they must eradicate from their speech every expression that is\ncheap or common. Let them be careful lest by attempting during\ntheir discourse to cause laughter, they dishonor God.\nOur message is a solemn and sacred one, and we must watch\nunto prayer. The words uttered must be of such a character that\nthrough them God can make an impression on heart and mind. Let\nthe ministers of the gospel be sanctified through the truth.\u2014Letter\n356, 1906.\nFalse Tests and Man-Made Standards\nTeach Fundamental Truths\u2014Those who would labor in word\nand doctrine, should be firmly established in the truth before they\nare authorized to go out into the field to teach others. The truth, pure\nand unadulterated, must be presented to the people. It is the third[212]\nangel\u2019s message that bears the true test to the people. Satan will lead\nmen to manufacture false tests, and thus seek to obscure the value\nof, and make of none effect, the message of truth.\nThe commandment of God that has been almost universally made\nvoid, is the testing truth for this time.... The time is coming when all\nthose who worship God will be distinguished by this sign. They will\nbe known as the servants of God, by this mark of their allegiance to\nHeaven. But all man-made tests will divert the mind from the great\nand important doctrines that constitute the present truth.\nIt is the desire and plan of Satan to bring in among us those who\nwill go to great extremes\u2014people of narrow minds, who are critical\nand sharp, and very tenacious in holding their own conceptions\nof what the truth means. They will be exacting, and will seek to\nenforce rigorous duties, and go to great lengths in matters of minor\nimportance, while they neglect the weightier matters of the law\u2014\njudgment and mercy and the love of God. Through the work of a\nfew of this class of persons, the whole body of Sabbathkeepers will\nbe designated as bigoted, Pharisaical, and fanatical. The work of the\ntruth, because of these workers, will be thought to be unworthy of\nnotice.\nGod has a special work for the men of experience to do. They\nare to guard the cause of God. They are to see that the work of God\nis not committed to men who feel it their privilege to move out on\ntheir own independent judgment, to preach whatever they please,\nand to be responsible to no one for their instructions or work. Let\nthis spirit of self-sufficiency once rule in our midst, and there will\nbe no harmony of action, no unity of spirit, no safety for the work,\nand no healthful growth in the cause. There will be false teachers,\n198\nFalse Tests and Man-Made Standards 199\nevil workers who will, by insinuating error, draw away souls from [213]\nthe truth. Christ prayed that His followers might be one as He and\nthe Father were one. Those who desire to see this prayer answered,\nshould seek to discourage the slightest tendency to division, and try\nto keep the spirit of unity and love among brethren.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, May 29, 1888.\nLittle Fables\u2014Not Worth a Straw\u2014We are not to give the call\nto those who have received the truth and understand it, to whom it\nhas been repeated over and over again till someone thinks he must\nbring in something original. He brings in little fables which are not\nworth a straw. These he brings forward as tests God has given, when\nSatan has originated them to divert minds from the true tests God\nhas given.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, April 16, 1901.\nNew and Strange Human Tests\u2014No one is to put truth to the\ntorture by placing a forced, mystical construction upon the Word.\nThus some are in danger of turning the truth of God into a lie. There\nare those who need in their hearts the touch of the divine Spirit. Then\nthe message for this time will be their burden. They will not search\nfor human tests, for something new and strange. The Sabbath of the\nfourth commandment is the test for this time, and all connected with\nthis great memorial is to be kept before the people.\u2014Manuscript 82,\n1894.\nFreedom From Human Suppositions\u2014The work of God is a\ngreat work. Wise men are needed, to keep Bible principles free\nfrom a particle of worldly policy. Every worker is being tested.\nPaul speaks of those who bring to the foundation wood, hay, and\nstubble. This represents those who bring in as truth that which is not\ntruth, even their own suppositions and fabrications. If these souls\nare saved, it will be as by fire, because they conscientiously thought [214]\nthey were working in harmony with the Word. They will only be as\nbrands snatched out of the burning.\nThe work which might have been pure, elevated, and noble, has\nbeen mingled with fallacies brought in by men. Thus the beauty\nof the truth has been marred. Nothing stands forth untainted by\nselfishness. The mingling of these fallacies with the work of God\nmakes that which should stand out clearly and distinctly before the\nworld, a jumble of conflicting principles in its practical working.\u2014\nLetter 3, 1901.\n200 Evangelism\nPreach the Word\u2014I have words to speak to the young men\nwho have been teaching the truth. Preach the Word. You may have\ninventive minds. You may be expert, as were the Jewish teachers,\nin getting up new theories; but Christ said of them, \u201cIn vain they\ndo worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\u201d\nMatthew 15:9. They presented to the people traditions, suppositions,\nand fables of all kinds. The forms and ceremonies they enjoined\nmade it simply impossible for the people to know whether they were\nkeeping the Word of God or following the traditions of men.\nSatan is well pleased when he can thus confuse the mind. Let\nnot ministers preach their own suppositions. Let them search the\nScriptures earnestly, with a solemn realization that if they teach for\ndoctrine the things that are not contained in God\u2019s Word, they will\nbe as those represented in the last chapter of Revelation.\nLet those who are tempted to indulge in fanciful, imaginary doc-\ntrines sink the shaft deep into the mines of heavenly truth, and secure\nthe riches which mean life eternal to the receiver. Precious treasure\nwill be secured by those who study God\u2019s Word with earnestness,\nfor heavenly angels will direct the search.\u2014Manuscript 82, 1894. [215]\nWhen Men Weave in Human Threads\u2014When men begin to\nweave in the human threads to compose the pattern of the web, the\nLord is in no hurry. He waits until men shall lay down their own\nhuman inventions and will accept the Lord\u2019s way and the Lord\u2019s\nwill.\u2014Letter 181, 1901.\nMaking a World of an Atom\u2014O how many might do a noble\nwork in self-denial and self-sacrifice, who are absorbed in the little\nthings of life! They are blind and cannot see afar off. They make\na world of an atom and an atom of a world. They have become\nshallow streams, because they do not impart to others the water of\nlife.\u2014Manuscript 173, 1898.\nMessage Impaired by One-Idea Men \u2014There was precious\ntalent in the church at -----, but God could not use these brethren\nuntil they were converted. There were some who had capabilities to\nhelp the church, but who needed first to set their own hearts in order.\nSome had been bringing in false tests, and had made their own ideas\nand notions a criterion, magnifying matters of little importance into\ntests of Christian fellowship, and binding heavy burdens upon others.\nThus a spirit of criticism, fault-finding, and dissension had come in,\nFalse Tests and Man-Made Standards 201\nwhich had been a great injury to the church. And the impression was\ngiven to unbelievers that Sabbathkeeping Adventists were a set of\nfanatics and extremists, and that their peculiar faith rendered them\nunkind, uncourteous, and really unchristian in character. Thus the\ncourse of a few extremists prevented the influence of the truth from\nreaching the people.\nSome were making the matter of dress of first importance, crit-\nicizing articles of dress worn by others, and standing ready to [216]\ncondemn everyone who did not exactly meet their ideas. A few\ncondemned pictures, urging that they are prohibited by the second\ncommandment, and that everything of this kind should be destroyed.\nThese one-idea men can see nothing except to press the one\nthing that presents itself to their minds. Years ago we had to meet\nthis same spirit and work. Men arose claiming to have been sent\nwith a message condemning pictures, and urging that every likeness\nof anything should be destroyed. They went to such lengths as even\nto condemn clocks which had figures, or \u201cpictures,\u201d upon them....\nA few in ----- had gone so far as to burn all the pictures in their\npossession, destroying even the likenesses of their friends. While we\nhad no sympathy with these fanatical movements, we advised that\nthose who had burned their pictures should not incur the expense of\nreplacing them. If they had acted conscientiously, they should be\nsatisfied to let the matter rest where it was. But they ought not to\nrequire others to do as they had done. They should not endeavor to\nbe conscience for their brethren and sisters.\u2014Historical Sketches,\n211, 212 (1886).\n202 Evangelism\nSection 8\u2014Preaching the Distinctive [217]\nTruths\nHeralding the Second Advent\nRouse People to Preparation \u2014We are living in the close of\nthis earth\u2019s history.... Prophecy is fulfilling. Soon Christ will come\nwith power and great glory. We have no time to lose. Let the message\nsound forth in earnest words of warning.\nWe must persuade men everywhere to repent and flee from the\nwrath to come. They have souls to save or to lose. Let there be no\nindifference in this matter. The Lord calls for workers who are filled\nwith an earnest, decided purpose. Tell the people to be instant in\nseason and out of season. With the words of life upon your lips go\nforth to tell men and women that the end of all things is at hand.\nLet us keep our souls in the love of God. The note of warning\nmust be given. The truth must not languish upon our lips. We must\nrouse people to immediate preparation, for we little know what is\nbefore us. My faith is as strong as ever that we are living in the last\nremnant of time. Let every teacher present an open door before all\nwho will come to Jesus, repenting of their sins.\u2014Letter 105, 1903.\nProclaim It in Every Land \u2014I have been instructed to trace\nwords of warning for our brethren and sisters who are in danger of\nlosing sight of the special work for this time.... In every land we\nare to herald the second coming of Christ, in the language of the[218]\nrevelator proclaiming: \u201cBehold, He cometh with clouds; and every\neye shall see Him.\u201d\u2014Testimonies For The Church 8:116 (1904).\nThe time has come when the message of Christ\u2019s soon coming is\nto sound throughout the world.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:24\n(1909).\nMessage, \u201cThe Lord Is Coming\u201d\u2014The Lord is coming. Lift\nup your heads and rejoice. Oh, we would think that those who hear\nthe joyful news, who claim to love Jesus, would be filled with joy\nunutterable and full of glory. This is the good, the joyful news which\nshould electrify every soul, which should be repeated in our homes,\nand told to those whom we meet on the street. What more joyful\nnews can be communicated! ...\n204\nHeralding the Second Advent 205\nThe voice of the true watchman needs now to be heard all along\nthe line, \u201cThe morning cometh, and also the night.\u201d The trumpet\nmust give a certain sound, for we are in the great day of the Lord\u2019s\npreparation.\u2014Letter 55, 1886.\nNo Time to Lose\u2014Sound an alarm through the land. Tell the\npeople that the day of the Lord is near, and hasteth greatly. Let none\nbe left unwarned. We might have been in the place of the poor souls\nwho are in error. According to the truth that we have received above\nothers, we are debtors to impart the same to them.\nWe have no time to lose. The powers of darkness are working\nwith intense energy, and with stealthy tread Satan is advancing to\ntake those who are now asleep, as a wolf taking his prey. We have\nwarnings now which we may give, a work now which we may do,\nbut soon it will be more difficult than we imagine....\nThe coming of the Lord is nearer than when we first believed. [219]\nThe great controversy is nearing its end. Every report of calamity by\nsea or land is a testimony to the fact that the end of all things is at\nhand. Wars and rumors of wars declare it. Is there a Christian whose\npulse does not beat with quickened action as he anticipates the great\nevents opening before us?\nThe Lord is coming. We hear the footsteps of an approaching\nGod, as He comes to punish the world for its iniquity. We are to\nprepare the way for Him by acting our part in getting a people ready\nfor that great day.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 12, 1914.\nLiving Power Must Attend Message\u2014Living power must at-\ntend the message of Christ\u2019s second appearing. We must not rest\nuntil we see many souls converted to the blessed hope of the Lord\u2019s\nreturn. In the days of the apostles the message that they bore wrought\na real work, turning souls from idols to serve the living God. The\nwork to be done today is just as real, and the truth is just as much\ntruth; only we are to give the message with as much more earnest-\nness as the coming of the Lord is nearer. The message for this time\nis positive, simple, and of the deepest importance. We must act\nlike men and women who believe it. Waiting, watching, working,\npraying, warning the world\u2014this is our work....\nAll heaven is astir, engaged in preparing for the day of God\u2019s\nvengeance, the day of Zion\u2019s deliverance. The time of tarrying is\nalmost ended. The pilgrims and strangers who have so long been\n206 Evangelism\nseeking a better country are almost home. I feel as if I must cry\naloud, Homeward bound! Rapidly we are nearing the time when\nChrist will come to gather His redeemed to Himself.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, November 13, 1913.\nAll Discourses in Light of Christ\u2019s Coming \u2014The truths of[220]\nprophecy are bound up together, and as we study them, they form\na beautiful cluster of practical Christian truth. All the discourses\nthat we give are plainly to reveal that we are waiting, working, and\npraying for the coming of the Son of God. His coming is our hope.\nThis hope is to be bound up with all our words and works, with all\nour associations and relationships.\u2014Letter 150, 1902.\nKey to History\u2014An understanding of the hope of Christ\u2019s sec-\nond coming is the key that unlocks all the history that follows, and\nexplains all the future lessons.\u2014Letter 218, 1906.\nEffect of Preaching the Second Advent\u2014The second coming\nof the Son of man is to be the wonderful theme kept before the\npeople. Here is a subject that should not be left out of our discourses.\nEternal realities must be kept before the mind\u2019s eye, and the attrac-\ntions of the world will appear as they are, altogether profitless as\nvanity. What are we to do with the world\u2019s vanities, its praises, its\nriches, its honors, or its enjoyments?\nWe are pilgrims and strangers who are waiting, hoping, and\npraying for that blessed hope, the glorious appearing of our Lord\nand Saviour Jesus Christ. If we believe this and bring it into our\npractical life, what vigorous action would this faith and hope inspire;\nwhat fervent love one for another; what careful holy living for the\nglory of God; and in our respect for the recompense of the reward,\nwhat distinct lines of demarcation would be evidenced between us\nand the world.\u2014Manuscript 39, 1893.\nKeep It Before the People \u2014The truth that Christ is coming\nshould be kept before every mind.\u2014Letter 131, 1900.\nA Caution Against Time-Setting Expressions\u2014The times and[221]\nseasons God has put in His own power. And why has not God given\nus this knowledge?\u2014Because we would not make a right use of it\nif He did. A condition of things would result from this knowledge\namong our people that would greatly retard the work of God in\npreparing a people to stand in the great day that is to come. We are\nnot to be engrossed with speculations in regard to the times and the\nHeralding the Second Advent 207\nseasons which God has not revealed. Jesus has told His disciples\nto \u201cwatch,\u201d but not for definite time. His followers are to be in the\nposition of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain;\nthey are to watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time\nfor the coming of the Lord; but no one will be able to predict just\nwhen that time will come; for \u201cof that day and hour knoweth no\nman.\u201d You will not be able to say that He will come in one, two, or\nfive years, neither are you to put off His coming by stating that it\nmay not be for ten or twenty years.... We are not to know the definite\ntime either for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit or for the coming\nof Christ.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 22, 1892.\nThe Sanctuary Truth\nThe Foundation of Our Faith\u2014The correct understanding of\nthe ministration in the heavenly sanctuary is the foundation of our\nfaith.\u2014Letter 208, 1906.\nThe Center of Christ\u2019s Atoning Work \u2014The subject of the\nsanctuary and the investigative judgment should be clearly under-\nstood by the people of God. All need a knowledge for themselves\nof the position and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise, it[222]\nwill be impossible for them to exercise the faith which is essential\nat this time, or to occupy the position which God designs them to\nfill. Every individual has a soul to save or to lose. Each has a case\npending at the bar of God. Each must meet the great Judge face to\nface. How important, then, that every mind contemplate often the\nsolemn scene when the judgment shall sit and the books shall be\nopened, when, with Daniel, every individual must stand in his lot, at\nthe end of the days.\nAll who have received the light upon these subjects are to bear\ntestimony of the great truths which God has committed to them. The\nsanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ\u2019s work in behalf\nof men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to\nview the plan of redemption, bringing us down to the very close\nof time, and revealing the triumphant issue of the contest between\nrighteousness and sin. It is of the utmost importance that all should\nthoroughly investigate these subjects, and be able to give an answer\nto every one that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them.\u2014\nThe Great Controversy, 488, 489 (1888).\nThe Key to a Complete System of Truth\u2014The subject of the\nsanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the disap-\npointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth,\nconnected and harmonious, showing that God\u2019s hand had directed\nthe great advent movement, and revealing present duty as it brought\nto light the position and work of His people.\u2014The Great Contro-\nversy, 423 (1888).\n208\nSanctuary Truth 209\nEyes Fixed on Sanctuary\u2014As a people, we should be earnest\nstudents of prophecy; we should not rest until we become intelligent\nin regard to the subject of the sanctuary, which is brought out in the [223]\nvisions of Daniel and John. This subject sheds great light on our\npresent position and work, and gives us unmistakable proof that God\nhas led us in our past experience. It explains our disappointment\nin 1844, showing us that the sanctuary to be cleansed was not the\nearth, as we had supposed, but that Christ then entered into the most\nholy apartment of the heavenly sanctuary, and is there performing\nthe closing work of His priestly office, in fulfillment of the words\nof the angel to the prophet Daniel, \u201cUnto two thousand and three\nhundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.\u201d\nOur faith in reference to the messages of the first, second, and\nthird angels was correct. The great waymarks we have passed are\nimmovable. Although the hosts of hell may try to tear them from\ntheir foundation, and triumph in the thought that they have suc-\nceeded, yet they do not succeed. These pillars of truth stand firm as\nthe eternal hills, unmoved by all the efforts of men combined with\nthose of Satan and his host. We can learn much, and should be con-\nstantly searching the Scriptures to see if these things are so. God\u2019s\npeople are now to have their eyes fixed on the heavenly sanctuary,\nwhere the final ministration of our great High Priest in the work of\nthe judgment is going forward,\u2014where He is interceding for His\npeople.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 27, 1883.\nThe Central Truth in a Simple Theology \u2014In every school\nestablished the most simple theory of theology should be taught. In\nthis theory, the atonement of Christ should be the great substance,\nthe central truth. The wonderful theme of redemption should be\npresented to the students.\u2014Manuscript 156, 1898.\nSeriousness of Sanctuary Truth \u2014While Christ is cleansing [224]\nthe sanctuary, the worshipers on earth should carefully review their\nlife, and compare their character with the standard of righteous-\nness.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 8, 1890.\nPreaching the Sanctuary Doctrine Endorsed by Holy\nSpirit\u2014For more than half a century the different points of present\ntruth have been questioned and opposed. New theories have been ad-\nvanced as truth, which were not truth, and the Spirit of God revealed\ntheir error. As the great pillars of our faith have been presented,\n210 Evangelism\nthe Holy Spirit has borne witness to them, and especially is this so\nregarding the truths of the sanctuary question. Over and over again\nthe Holy Spirit has in a marked manner endorsed the preaching of\nthis doctrine. But today, as in the past, some will be led to form new\ntheories and to deny the truths upon which the Spirit of God has\nplaced His approval.\u2014Manuscript 125, 1907.\nFalse Theories Regarding the Sanctuary \u2014In the future, de-\nception of every kind is to arise, and we want solid ground for our\nfeet. We want solid pillars for the building. Not one pin is to be\nremoved from that which the Lord has established. The enemy will\nbring in false theories, such as the doctrine that there is no sanctuary.\nThis is one of the points on which there will be a departing from\nthe faith. Where shall we find safety unless it be in the truths that\nthe Lord has been giving for the last fifty years?\u2014The Review and\nHerald, May 25, 1905.\nContest Over Distinguishing Truth\u2014The time is near when\nthe deceptive powers of satanic agencies will be fully developed.\nOn one side is Christ, who has been given all power in heaven and\nearth. On the other side is Satan, continually exercising his power to[225]\nallure, to deceive with strong, spiritualistic sophistries, to remove\nGod out of the places that He should occupy in the minds of men.\nSatan is striving continually to bring in fanciful suppositions\nin regard to the sanctuary, degrading the wonderful representations\nof God and the ministry of Christ for our salvation into something\nthat suits the carnal mind. He removes its presiding power from\nthe hearts of believers, and supplies its place with fantastic theories\ninvented to make void the truths of the atonement, and destroy our\nconfidence in the doctrines which we have held sacred since the\nthird angel\u2019s message was first given. Thus he would rob us of our\nfaith in the very message that has made us a separate people, and\nhas given character and power to our work.\u2014Special Testimonies,\nSeries B, No. 7, p. 17. (1905).\nPresenting the Law and the Sabbath\nOur Special Message\u2014The Lord has a special message for His\nambassadors to bear. They are to give the people the warning, calling\nupon them to repair the breach that has been made by the Papacy\nin the law of God. The Sabbath has been made a nonentity, an\nunessential requirement, which human authority can set aside. The\nholy day of the Lord has been changed to a common working day.\nMen have torn down God\u2019s memorial, placing a false rest day in its\nstead.\u2014Manuscript 35, 1900.\nThe Last Message to the World\u2014The last message of warning\nto the world is to lead men to see the importance that God attaches to\nHis law. So plainly is the truth to be presented that no transgressor, [226]\nhearing it, shall be excusable in failing to discern the importance of\nobedience to God\u2019s commands.\nI am instructed to say, Gather from the Scriptures the proofs\nthat God has sanctified the seventh day, and let these proofs be read\nbefore the congregation. Let those who have not heard the truth be\nshown that all who turn aside from a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d\nmust suffer the result of their course. In all ages the Sabbath has\nbeen the test of loyalty to God. \u201cIt is a sign between Me and the\nchildren of Israel forever,\u201d the Lord declares.\u2014Gospel Workers, 148,\n149 (1915).\nThe Deciding Question for Whole World\u2014The light concern-\ning the binding claims of the law of God is to be presented every-\nwhere. This is to be a deciding question. It will test and prove the\nworld.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 7, pp. 17, 18. (1874).\nThe Build-up in New Fields\u2014I have had to break off writing\nto have an interview with Brother _____. He is in some perplexity....\nHe wished to know how to present the truth in entering new fields,\nwhether the Sabbath should be presented first.\nI told him that the best and wisest plan would be to dwell upon\nsubjects that would arouse the conscience. He could talk to them\nupon practical godliness; devotion and piety; and present the self-\n211\n212 Evangelism\ndenial, self-sacrificing life of Jesus as our example until they will\nsee the contrast in their self-indulgent life, and become dissatisfied\nwith their unchristian lives.\nThen present to them the prophecies; show them the purity and\nbinding claims of the Word of God. Not one jot or tittle of this law\nis to lose its force, but hold its binding claims on every soul to the\nend of time. When the law of God is made void; when the Christian[227]\nworld is joined to the Catholic and the worldly, in making of none\neffect the commandments of God, then God\u2019s chosen people arise to\ndefend the law of Jehovah.\nThis is the guile that Paul used; this is the wisdom of the serpent;\nthe harmlessness of the dove. When we come to a community that\nis acquainted with our faith, this cautious course need not to be\npursued, but in every case special efforts should be made to come\nclose to hearts by personal efforts. Avoid running down the churches;\ndo not let the people receive the idea that your work is to tear down,\nbut to build up, and to present the truth as it is in Jesus. Dwell much\nupon the necessity of vital godliness.\u2014Letter 2, 1885.\nBroaching the Sabbath in New Fields\u2014The message of truth\nis new and startling to the people of this country [Australia]. The\nBible doctrines presented are as a new revelation, and they really\nlook upon the sentiments advanced as infidelity. In presenting the\nSunday question, or the union of church and state, handle it carefully.\nIt will not answer to present the strong positions that have been and\nwill of necessity be presented in America.\nThese subjects must be broached guardedly. We have not as yet\nobtained standing place in this country. The enemy of all righteous-\nness has been and still is working by every device he can invent to\nhinder the work that ought to be done in enlightening and educating\nthe people; his forces are increasing. Delays have been giving Satan\nadvantage of the situation, and these delays have caused the loss\nof many souls. The Lord is not pleased with the retarding of the\nwork. Every delay renders more difficult the work that must be done,\nbecause advantage is given for Satan to preoccupy the field, and[228]\nprepare for determined resistance.\nThe tardy movements of our people in raising the standard in\nour large cities are not in harmony with the light given of God. A\nglimmering of light has been shining in the cities, but just enough to\nPresenting the Law and the Sabbath 213\nmake the false shepherds feel that it is time for them to be actively\nat work in presenting fables and falsehoods to turn the people away\nfrom the message of truth. Some little effort has been made, but\nmen and money are not furnished to do the work. Satan has worked\nand will work with his lying wonders, and strong delusions will\nbe accepted where the banner of truth should have been uplifted.\nNow the fact that God\u2019s people that know the truth have failed to do\ntheir duty according to the light given in the Word of God, makes\nit a necessity for us to be more guarded, lest we offend unbelievers\nbefore they have heard the reasons of our faith in regard to the\nSabbath and Sunday....\nThere is need now to give to the people patient, kind instruction;\nthe education of a lifetime is not to be readily counteracted; great\ntact and patient effort are needed by those who shall present the truth\nin any manner.\u2014Manuscript 95, 1894.\nDefer Its Presentation \u2014You should not feel it your duty to\nintroduce arguments upon the Sabbath question as you meet the\npeople. If persons mention the subject, tell them that this is not your\nburden now. But when they surrender heart and mind and will to\nGod, they are then prepared candidly to weigh evidence in regard to\nthese solemn, testing truths.\u2014Letter 77, 1895.\nCaution Against Undue Delay\u2014Caution is needed; but while\nsome of the workers are guarded, and make haste slowly, if there [229]\nare not united with them in the work those who see the necessity\nof being aggressive, very much will be lost; opportunities will pass,\nand the opening providence of God will not be discerned.\nWhen persons who are under conviction are not brought to make\na decision at the earliest period possible, there is danger that the\nconviction will gradually wear away....\nFrequently when a congregation is at the very point where the\nheart is prepared for the Sabbath question, it is delayed through fear\nof the consequences. This has been done, and the result has not been\ngood.\u2014Letter 31, 1892.\nIn a Brief Campaign\u2014When you have a congregation before\nyou for only two weeks, do not defer the presentation of the Sabbath\nquestion until everything else is presented, supposing that you thus\npave the way for it. Lift up the standard, the commandments of God,\nand the faith of Jesus. Make this the important theme. Then, by your\n214 Evangelism\nstrong arguments, make it of still greater force. Dwell more on the\nRevelation. Read, explain, and enforce its teaching.\nOur warfare is aggressive. Tremendous issues are before us, yea,\nand right upon us. Let our prayers ascend to God that the four angels\nmay still hold the four winds, that they may not blow to injure or\ndestroy until the last warning has been given to the world. Then\nlet us work in harmony with our prayers. Let nothing lessen the\nforce of the truth for this time. The present truth is to be our burden.\nThe third angel\u2019s message must do its work of separating from the\nchurches a people who will take their stand on the platform of eternal\ntruth.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:61 (1900).\nLife and Death Message \u2014We are as a people in danger of[230]\ngiving the third angel\u2019s message in such an indefinite manner that\nit does not impress the people.... Our message is a life-and-death\nmessage, and we must let this message appear as it is,\u2014the great\npower of God. Then the Lord will make it effectual. We are to\npresent it in all its telling force.\u2014Letter 209, 1899.\nMessage Not Muffled \u2014Satan has devised a state of things\nwhereby the proclamation of the third angel\u2019s message shall be\nbound about. We must beware of his plans and methods. There\nmust be no toning down of the truth, no muffling of the message\nfor this time. The third angel\u2019s message must be strengthened and\nconfirmed. The eighteenth chapter of Revelation reveals the impor-\ntance of presenting the truth in no measured terms but with boldness\nand power.... There has been too much beating about the bush in the\nproclamation of the third angel\u2019s message. The message has not been\ngiven as clearly and distinctly as it should have been.\u2014Manuscript\n16, 1900.\nAs Christ Presented the Law\u2014Christ presented the principles\nof the law of God in a direct, forcible way, showing His hearers that\nthey had neglected to carry out these principles. His words were so\ndefinite and pointed that the listeners found no opportunity to cavil\nor raise objections.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 13, 1906.\nPaul Adapted His Methods \u2014To the Gentiles, he [Paul]\npreached Christ as their only hope of salvation, but did not at first\nhave anything definite to say upon the law. But after their hearts\nwere warmed with the presentation of Christ as the gift of God to our\nworld, and what was comprehended in the work of the Redeemer\nPresenting the Law and the Sabbath 215\nin the costly sacrifice to manifest the love of God to man, in the [231]\nmost eloquent simplicity he showed that love for all mankind\u2014Jew\nand Gentile\u2014that they might be saved by surrendering their hearts\nto Him. Thus when, melted and subdued, they gave themselves to\nthe Lord, he presented the law of God as the test of their obedience.\nThis was the manner of his working\u2014adapting his methods to win\nsouls.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 6, p. 55. (1895).\nFirst the Fundamental Principles \u2014Do not make prominent\nthose features of the message which are a condemnation of the\ncustoms and practices of the people, until they have opportunity to\nknow that we are believers in Christ, that we believe in His divinity\nand in His pre-existence. Let the testimony of the world\u2019s Redeemer\nbe dwelt upon.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:58 (1900).\nWe Preach the Gospel\u2014Let the outsiders understand that we\npreach the gospel as well as the law, and they will feast upon these\ntruths, and many will take their stand for the truth.\u2014Letter 1, 1889.\nWill Convict of Sin\u2014The law and the gospel, revealed in the\nWord, are to be preached to the people; for the law and the gospel,\nblended, will convict of sin. God\u2019s law, while condemning sin,\npoints to the gospel, revealing Jesus Christ, in whom \u201cdwelleth all\nthe fullness of the Godhead bodily.\u201d The glory of the gospel reflects\nlight upon the Jewish age, giving significance to the whole Jewish\neconomy of types and shadows. Thus both the law and the gospel\nare blended. In no discourse are they to be divorced.\u2014Manuscript\n21, 1891.\nThe religionist generally has divorced the law and the gospel,\nwhile we have on the other hand almost done the same from another\nstandpoint. We have not held up before the people the righteousness\nof Christ and the full significance of His great plan of redemption. [232]\nWe have left out Christ and His matchless love, and brought in\nthe theories and reasonings, preached arguments.\u2014Manuscript 24,\n1890.\nThey Go Hand in Hand\u2014If we would have the spirit and power\nof the third angel\u2019s message, we must present the law and the gospel\ntogether, for they go hand in hand.\u2014Gospel Workers, 161 (1915).\nReinforce the Message With Literature\u2014The days in which\nwe live are times that call for constant vigilance, times in which\nGod\u2019s people should be awake to do a great work in presenting the\n216 Evangelism\nlight on the Sabbath question.... This last warning to the inhabitants\nof the earth is to make men see the importance God attaches to His\nholy law. So plainly is the truth to be presented that no transgressor,\nhearing it, shall fail to discern the importance of obedience to the\nSabbath commandment....\nThere is work for all to do in order that the simple truths of\nthe Word of God may be made known. The words of Scripture\nshould be printed and published just as they read. It would be well\nif the nineteenth and the greater portion of the twentieth chapters\nof Exodus, with verses twelve to eighteen of the thirty-first chapter,\nwere printed just as they stand. Crowd these truths into small books\nand pamphlets, and let the word of God speak to the people. When\na discourse concerning the law is preached that is right to the point,\nif you have any means of doing so, get it into a printed leaflet. Then\nwhen those who plead for Sunday laws meet you, place these leaflets\nin their hands. Tell them that you have no discussion over the Sunday\nquestion, for you have a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d for the keeping\nof the seventh day.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 26, 1908.\nMake the Distinguishing Mark Prominent \u2014We are to give[233]\nto the world a manifestation of the pure, noble, holy principles that\nare to distinguish the people of God from the world. Instead of the\npeople of God becoming less and less definitely distinguished from\nthose who do not keep the seventh-day Sabbath, they are to make\nthe observance of the Sabbath so prominent that the world cannot\nfail to recognize them as Seventh-day Adventist.\u2014Manuscript 162,\n1903.\nCalled to Expose Man of Sin \u2014In the very time in which we\nlive the Lord has called His people and has given them a message\nto bear. He has called them to expose the wickedness of the man\nof sin who has made the Sunday law a distinctive power, who has\nthought to change times and laws, and to oppress the people of God\nwho stand firmly to honor Him by keeping the only true Sabbath,\nthe Sabbath of creation, as holy unto the Lord.\u2014Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 118 (1903).\nA Distinct People With a Testing Message \u2014The Lord has\nbeen pleased to give His people the third angel\u2019s message as a\ntesting message to bear to the world. John beholds a people distinct\nand separate from the world, who refuse to worship the beast or\nPresenting the Law and the Sabbath 217\nhis image, who bear God\u2019s sign, keeping holy His Sabbath\u2014the\nseventh-day to be kept holy as a memorial of the living God, the\nCreator of heaven and earth. Of them the apostle writes, \u201cHere are\nthey that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d\u2014\nLetter 98, 1900.\nThe Mark of the Beast \u2014When Sunday observance shall be\nenforced by law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning the\nobligation of the true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the\ncommand of God, to obey a precept which has no higher author- [234]\nity than that of Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He\nis paying homage to Rome, and to the power which enforces the\ninstitution ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his\nimage. As men then reject the institution which God has declared to\nbe the sign of His authority, and honor in its stead that which Rome\nhas chosen as the token of her supremacy, they will thereby accept\nthe sign of allegiance to Rome,\u2014\u201cthe mark of the beast.\u201d And it\nis not until the issue is thus plainly set before the people, and they\nare brought to choose between the commandments of God and the\ncommandments of men, that those who continue in transgression\nwill receive \u201cthe mark of the beast.\u201d\u2014The Great Controversy, 449\n(1888).\nReception of Mark of the Beast Future \u2014The change of the\nSabbath is the sign or mark of the authority of the Romish church.\nThose who, understanding the claims of the fourth commandment,\nchoose to observe the false sabbath in the place of the true, are\nthereby paying homage to that power by which alone it is com-\nmanded. The mark of the beast is the papal sabbath, which has been\naccepted by the world in the place of the day of God\u2019s appointment.\nNo one has yet received the mark of the beast. The testing time\nhas not yet come. There are true Christians in every church, not\nexcepting the Roman Catholic communion. None are condemned\nuntil they have had the light and have seen the obligation of the\nfourth commandment. But when the decree shall go forth enforcing\nthe counterfeit sabbath, and the loud cry of the third angel shall warn\nmen against the worship of the beast and his image, the line will be\nclearly drawn between the false and the true. Then those who still [235]\ncontinue in transgression will receive the mark of the beast.\n218 Evangelism\nWith rapid steps we are approaching this period. When Protes-\ntant churches shall unite with the secular power to sustain a false\nreligion, for opposing which their ancestors endured the fiercest per-\nsecution, then will the papal sabbath be enforced by the combined\nauthority of church and state. There will be a national apostasy,\nwhich will end only in national ruin.\u2014Manuscript 51, 1899.\nWhen Seal of God Is Refused \u2014If the light of truth has been\npresented to you, revealing the Sabbath of the fourth commandment,\nand showing that there is no foundation in the Word of God for\nSunday observance, and yet you still cling to the false sabbath,\nrefusing to keep holy the Sabbath which God calls \u201cMy holy day,\u201d\nyou receive the mark of the beast. When does this take place? When\nyou obey the decree that commands you to cease from labor on\nSunday and worship God, while you know that there is not a word\nin the Bible showing Sunday to be other than a common working\nday, you consent to receive the mark of the beast, and refuse the seal\nof God.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 13, 1897.\nAs a Result of Disregard of Light \u2014God has given men the\nSabbath as a sign between Him and them, as a test of their loyalty.\nThose who, after the light regarding God\u2019s law comes to them,\ncontinue to disobey and exalt human laws above the law of God in\nthe great crisis before us will receive the mark of the beast.\u2014Letter\n98, 1900.\nCaution in Presenting the Sunday Question \u2014[We are] not\nto provoke those who have accepted this spurious sabbath, an in-\nstitution of the Papacy in the place of God\u2019s holy Sabbath. Their\nnot having the Bible arguments in their favor makes them all the[236]\nmore angry and determined to supply the place of arguments that\nare wanting in the Word of God by the power of their might. The\nforce of persecution follows the steps of the dragon. Therefore great\ncare should be exercised to give no provocation.\u2014Letter 55, 1886.\nLet the Truth Do the Cutting\u2014Satan\u2019s efforts against the ad-\nvocates of the truth will wax more bitter and determined to the very\nclose of time. As in Christ\u2019s day the chief priests and rulers stirred\nup the people against Him, so today the religious leaders will excite\nbitterness and prejudice against the truth for this time. The people\nwill be led to acts of violence and opposition which they would\nPresenting the Law and the Sabbath 219\nnever have thought of had they not been imbued with the animosity\nof professed Christians against the truth.\nAnd what course shall the advocates of truth pursue? They have\nthe unchangeable, eternal Word of God, and they should reveal the\nfact that they have the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not be\nrugged and sharp. In their presentation of truth they must manifest\nthe love and meekness and gentleness of Christ. Let the truth do the\ncutting; the Word of God is as a sharp, two-edged sword, and will\ncut its way to the heart. Those who know that they have the truth\nshould not, by the use of harsh and severe expressions, give Satan\none chance to misinterpret their spirit.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nOctober 14, 1902.\nA Call to Enlighten the Masses\u2014I have been shown that Satan\nis stealing a march upon us. The law of God, through the agency of\nSatan, is to be made void. In our land of boasted freedom, religious\nliberty will come to an end. The contest will be decided over the\nSabbath question, which will agitate the whole world.\nOur time for work is limited, and God calls us as ministers [237]\nand people to be minutemen. Teachers as wise as serpents and\nas harmless as doves must come to the help of the Lord, to the\nhelp of the Lord against the mighty. There are many who do not\nunderstand the prophecies relating to these days, and they must be\nenlightened.\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\nMeeting Sabbathkeeping Problems\nNo Cause to Worry or Fear\u2014Often when our workers present\nthe testing Sabbath truth to the people, some stand hesitating for fear\nof bringing poverty and hardship upon themselves and their families.\nThey say, Yes, I see what you are trying to show me in regard to the\nobservance of the seventh-day Sabbath; but I am afraid if I keep the\nSabbath I shall lose my position, and shall not be able to provide for\nmy family. And so, many keep their worldly position and disobey\nthe command of God. But these scriptures [Luke 12:1-7] teach us\nthat the Lord knows all about our experiences; He understands about\nour inconveniences; and He has a care for all who follow on to know\nthe Lord. He will never allow His children to be tempted above that\nthey are able to bear.\nChrist declared to His disciples: \u201cTake no thought for your life,\nwhat ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. The life\nis more than meat, and the body is more than raiment. Consider the\nravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse\nnor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than\nthe fowls? And which of you with taking thought can add to his\nstature one cubit? If ye then be not able to do that thing which is\nleast, why take ye thought for the rest?\u201d\nHolding up before them the lily of the field in its beauty and[238]\npurity, the Saviour continued: \u201cConsider the lilies how they grow:\nthey toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in\nall his glory was not arrayed like one of these. If then God so clothe\nthe grass, which is today in the field, and tomorrow is cast into the\noven; how much more will He clothe you, O ye of little faith?\n\u201cAnd seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither\nbe ye of doubtful mind. For all these things do the nations of the\nworld seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these\nthings. But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things\nshall be added unto you.\u201d\n220\nMeeting Sabbathkeeping Problems 221\nChrist is here teaching a precious lesson in regard to His service.\nWhatever experiences may come to you, He says, serve God. What-\never inconveniences and hardships you may encounter, trust in the\nLord. We have no cause to worry and fear if we take our position\nfor the truth, that we and our families will suffer. To do this is to\nmanifest unbelief in God. \u201cYour Father knoweth that ye have need\nof these things,\u201d the Saviour says. If we would study the Word more\nfaithfully, we would increase in faith.\u2014Manuscript 83, 1909.\nTime to Extend a Helping Hand\u2014It is an important time now\nfor these localities where an interest has been awakened. A large\nnumber ... are in the valley of decision. O that the Lord will give\nto His servants wisdom to speak to these souls such words as shall\ngive them courage to confess the truth and surrender their will, their\nheart\u2019s entire devotion, to God. We pray that the Lord will inspire\nwith faith these souls who are convinced of the truth, that the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord, that they shall not confer with their [239]\nown feelings and let the enemy lead them to decide that the sacrifice\nis too great.\nThey will suffer loss in temporal matters, and a helping hand\nmust not be wanting. Many ask, \u201cHow can we support our families?\nWe shall lose our positions as soon as we decide to keep holy the\nseventh day and do no work on the Sabbath. Our families, shall they\nstarve?\u201d What can we say? Poverty and want are seen everywhere,\nand honest souls know not what to do. They dare not venture out;\nyet they are fully convinced that the seventh day is the Sabbath of\nthe Lord. They know that God blessed the seventh day and set it\napart for man to observe as a memorial of His creating of the world\nin six days and His rest upon the seventh day.\nWhen we see the difficulties standing like mountains before their\nsouls, the prospect of want to themselves and children staring them\nin the face, our hearts are pained. Many a one says, \u201cI want to\nobserve the seventh day, but as soon as I state to my employer that I\nhave decided to keep the Sabbath, I shall be discharged.\u201d Hundreds\nare waiting to step into any place made vacant. I am sorely troubled.\nAll we can do is to encourage them to have faith, and pray for them.\nOh, sometimes I wish I had a million dollars. I could use every\ndollar in this work....\n222 Evangelism\nMany become decided transgressors of God\u2019s holy law as the\nresult of union, concord, and co-operation with companions who\nare instruments of Satan. God sends them light to undeceive them,\nbut they refuse to take the Word of God as it reads. They accept\nerror, choosing the lies of Satan rather than a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nAnd these advocates of error make it very hard for those who see the\ntruth to obey it. Human sight can see nothing but starvation before\nthose who keep the Sabbath.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1894.\nNever Results in Starvation\u2014Never need anyone fear that ob-[240]\nservance of the true Sabbath will result in starvation. [Isaiah 58:11,\n12; Proverbs 7:2; Isaiah 58:14.] These promises are a sufficient\nanswer to all the excuses that man may invent for refusing to keep\nthe Sabbath. Even if, after beginning to keep God\u2019s law, it seems\nimpossible to support one\u2019s family, let every doubting soul realize\nthat God has promised to care for those who obey His command-\nments.\u2014Manuscript 116, 1902.\nIt Takes Men of Courage\u2014It requires moral courage to take\na position to keep the commandments of the Lord. An opposer of\nthe truth once said that it was only weak-minded people, foolish,\nignorant persons, who would turn away from the churches to keep\nthe seventh day as the Sabbath. But a minister who had embraced\nthe truth, replied, \u201cIf you think it takes weak-minded persons, just\ntry it.\u201d It takes moral courage, firmness, decision, perseverance, and\nvery much prayer to step out on the unpopular side. We are thankful\nthat we can come to Christ as the poor suffering ones came to Christ\nin the temple....\nYou have not dared to trample under foot the commandments\nof God, and have stepped out on unpopular truth, let the result be\nwhat it may. Will the Saviour ever turn away to leave you to struggle\nalone? No, never. But He never told His disciples that they should\nhave no trials, no self-denial to endure, no sacrifices to make. The\nMaster was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. \u201cYe know\nthe grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that though He was rich, yet\nfor your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might\nbe rich.\u201d We thank God that in your poverty you can call God your\nFather.\nPoverty is coming upon this world, and there will be a time of[241]\ntrouble such as never was since there was a nation. There will be\nMeeting Sabbathkeeping Problems 223\nwars and rumors of wars, and the faces of men will gather paleness.\nYou may have to suffer distress; you may go hungry sometimes;\nbut God will not forsake you in your suffering. He will test your\nfaith. We are not to live to please ourselves. We are here to manifest\nChrist to the world, to represent Him and His power to mankind.\u2014\nManuscript 37, 1894.\nTime to Rely on God\u2019s Word \u2014In the wilderness, when all\nmeans of sustenance failed, God sent His people manna from heaven;\nand a sufficient and constant supply was given. This provision was\nto teach them that while they trusted in God, and walked in His ways,\nHe would not forsake them. The Saviour now practiced the lesson\nHe had taught to Israel. By the word of God, succor had been given\nto the Hebrew host, and by the same word it would be given to Jesus.\nHe awaited God\u2019s time to bring relief. He was in the wilderness in\nobedience to God, and He would not obtain food by following the\nsuggestions of Satan. In the presence of the witnessing universe, He\ntestified that it is a less calamity to suffer whatever may befall, than\nto depart in any manner from the will of God.\n\u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.\u201d\nOften the follower of Christ is brought where he cannot serve God\nand carry forward his worldly enterprises. Perhaps it appears that\nobedience to some plain requirement of God will cut off his means\nof support. Satan would make him believe that he must sacrifice\nhis conscientious convictions. But the only thing in our world upon\nwhich we can rely, is the Word of God. \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom\nof God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added\nunto you.\u201d Even in this life it is not for our good to depart from [242]\nthe will of our Father in heaven. When we learn the power of His\nword, we shall not follow the suggestions of Satan in order to obtain\nfood or to save our lives. Our only questions will be, What is God\u2019s\ncommand? and what His promise? Knowing these, we shall obey\nthe one, and trust the other.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 121 (1898).\nAn Appeal to One in the Valley of Decision\u2014The enemy was\ntelling you to wait for a more convenient season. He has been on\nhand with his devices presenting to you the advantages you would\ngain if you did not keep the Sabbath, and the disadvantages you\nwould realize in keeping the Sabbath. He has prepared these various\nexcuses why you should not make your decision to be obedient to\n224 Evangelism\nthe law of God. He is a deceiver. He falsifies the character of God,\nand you have accepted his temptation. All your imaginings have\nshown distrust of your heavenly Father.\nYou have thought when you could realize a certain prosperity\nin your business, then you would obey the Sabbath of the fourth\ncommandment. But the Lord requires of every one of His subjects\nentire obedience. God\u2019s requirements were upon you, and you have\nbeen making terms with God. And all the time Satan has been\nworking to make it more and still more impossible as you look at\nthe matter, to decide to keep the Sabbath. You have been growing\nless and less susceptible to the movings of the Spirit of God upon\nyour heart. The Lord has given me a message for you and for your\nchildren to take up your long-neglected duty, to walk in the light as\nHe is in the light. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy\nheart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all\nthy mind.\u201d \u201cThis do,\u201d said Christ of a lawyer, \u201cand thou shalt live.\u201d\nThis is the voice of God to yourself and to your children. The law of[243]\nGod is good as well as just and profitable to all who obey, and you\nwill show honor to Him whom you obey.\nWhen your mind is brought into conformity to the will of God,\nto obey His commandments, think you that the Lord will not have\na care for you and your temporal interests? You have been almost\npersuaded, but did not obey. You thought you would wait until\nthe way cleared before you. The Lord has left every human agent\nresponsible for his course of action. God\u2019s claims are to be your\nfirst consideration. Obedience to God is your first duty. You are to\nleave all the consequences in His hands. You have been hesitating\nbecause you do not now realize the strong convictions that you once\nhad, and would not yield to obey. You need not expect as forcible\nconviction again. You will have to obey God and take your position\non the truth, feeling or no feeling. Your business now is to work\ndecidedly from principle, to make your decisions irrespective of\nconsequences.\u2014Letter 72, 1893.\nLive Up to Every Ray of Light\u2014Live up to every ray of light\nthat you have received. Your eternal interests are involved here, and\nthat is why I say, \u201cCherish every ray of light.\u201d On your knees ask\nChrist to impress your heart by His Holy Spirit, and turn not away\nfrom His law.\u2014Manuscript 10, 1894.\nMeeting Sabbathkeeping Problems 225\nBetter Lose Position Than Jesus\u2014Do not think that if you take\nyour position for the Bible truth you will lose your position. You\nhad better lose your position than lose Jesus. You had better be\npartakers of the self-denial and self-sacrifice of the Lord than to go\nin your own way seeking to gather to yourself the treasures of this\nlife. You cannot carry any of it into the grave. You will come up\nfrom the grave without anything, but if you have Jesus you will have [244]\neverything. He is all that you will require to stand the test of the day\nof God, and is not this enough for you?\u2014Manuscript 20, 1894.\nA Decided Stand \u2014Men may raise up all the combativeness\nthey please, but the commandments of God are the commandments\nof God still. We have decided to keep God\u2019s commandments and\nlive, and [preserve] His law as the apple of our eye. Let men rail\nout against the law of God and trample His commandment-keeping\npeople under their feet. Can they do it and live? It is impossible.\nGod has His measurement of character, and it is those who obey\nHim that live, and those who keep His law as the apple of their eye\nthat He preserves.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1891.\nOffering Positions to New Sabbathkeepers \u2014Among those\nwho embraced the truth at _____ last winter was a young man who\nleft the school that he was attending, in order to keep the Sabbath.\nHe was asked what he expected to do for a living. He replied, \u201cGod\nhas given me physical strength, and I will work in any capacity rather\nthan break His commandments.\u201d Some felt anxious that he should\nbe given a place in the printing office, but one said, \u201cNo. When he\nshows that he will obey God at any cost, then we shall know that he\nis the very man we need in this office. But if he has not principle\nenough to do this, he is just the man that we do not want.\u201d\nElder _____ came to me, and asked me if he ought to give the\nyoung man encouragement to think that he would be given a place\nin the office. I said, \u201cThe God of heaven has presented before him\nthe eternal weight of glory that awaits the overcomer, and if like\nMoses, he has respect unto the recompense of reward, he will take\nhis position decidedly on the side of truth. But it would do harm [245]\nand not good to hold out before him any bribe or attraction. And yet\nyour duty is to help him to see that he must walk out by faith, but do\nnot leave him to wrestle this battle out alone, for Satan will tempt\n226 Evangelism\nhim, and you must render him every help possible.\u201d\u2014Manuscript\n26, 1886.\nBusiness Ties With Sabbathbreakers\u2014There is need of a Sab-\nbath reform among us, who profess to observe God\u2019s holy rest day.\nSome discuss their business matters and lay plans on the Sabbath,\nand God looks upon this in the same light as though they engaged in\nthe actual transaction of business.\nOthers who are well acquainted with the Bible evidences that the\nseventh day is the Sabbath, enter into partnership with men who have\nno respect for God\u2019s holy day. A Sabbathkeeper cannot allow men\nin his employ, paid by his money, to work on the Sabbath. If, for the\nsake of gain, he allows the business in which he has an interest to be\ncarried on on the Sabbath by his unbelieving partner, he is equally\nguilty with the unbeliever; and it is his duty to dissolve the relation,\nhowever much he may lose by so doing. Men may think they cannot\nafford to obey God, but they cannot afford to disobey Him. Those\nwho are careless in their observance of the Sabbath will suffer great\nloss.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 18, 1884.\nOne Kind of Employment for Sabbathkeepers\u2014We find here\nthe best class of people to work for. And for many of them it would\nnot be difficult to keep the Sabbath. _____is a place where a great\ndeal of poultry raising is done. With almost every dwelling house\non the outskirts of the city poultry yards are connected. The houses\nare not built in terraces, but stand apart from one another, often\nsurrounded by several acres of land. Poultry of all kinds is raised,\nand the eggs find a ready market in _____ and _____, and are taken[246]\nto the city by boat.\nI write this that you may understand the situation. In poultry\nraising many families find a means of livelihood, and these could\nnot raise the objection that many raise to keeping the Sabbath\u2014that\nit would interfere with their business. They could keep the Sabbath\nwithout fear of losing their employment.\u2014Letter 113, 1902.\nPreaching on Nonimmortality\nDelay Presentation of Objectionable Features \u2014Great wis-\ndom should be used in the presentation of a truth that comes directly\nin opposition to the opinions and practices of the people. Paul\u2019s\nhabit was to dwell upon the prophecies when with the Jewish people,\nand bring them down step by step, and then after some time open\nthe subject of Christ as the true Messiah.\nI have been shown that our ministers go too rapidly through their\nsubjects and bring the most objectionable features of our faith too\nearly into their effort. There are truths that will not involve so great a\ncross, that should be kept before their minds, day after day and even\nweeks before the Sabbath and immortality questions are entered\nupon. Then you gain the confidence of the people as being men who\nhave clear, forcible arguments, and they think you understand the\nScriptures. When once the confidence of the people is gained, then\nit is time enough to introduce publicly the Sabbath and immortality\nquestions.\nBut men who are not wise advance these questions too soon, and\nthus close the ears of the people, when with greater care and more\nfaith and aptness and wisdom they could have carried them along\nstep by step through the important events in the prophecies and in [247]\ndwelling upon practical subjects in the teachings of Christ.\u2014Letter\n48, 1886.\nOne of the Great Delusions\u2014Every species of delusion is now\nbeing brought in. The plainest truths of God\u2019s Word are covered\nwith a mass of man-made theories. Deadly errors are presented as\nthe truth to which all must bow. The simplicity of true godliness is\nburied beneath tradition.\nThe doctrine of the natural immortality of the soul is one error\nwith which the enemy is deceiving man. This error is well-nigh\nuniversal....\nThis is one of the lies forged in the synagogue of the enemy, one\nof the poisonous drafts of Babylon. \u201cAll nations have drunk of the\n227\n228 Evangelism\nwine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have\ncommitted fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are\nwaxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard\nanother voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people,\nthat ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her\nplagues.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, March 16, 1897.\nEmphasize Life Through Jesus\u2014The question of the nonim-\nmortality of the soul also needs to be treated with great care, lest\nin introducing the subject there be started a deep and exciting con-\ntroversy which will close the door to further investigation of the\ntruth.\nGreat wisdom is required in dealing with human minds, even\nin giving a reason of the hope that is within us....What is the hope\nof which we are to give a reason? The hope of eternal life through\nJesus Christ.... You dwell too much upon special ideas and doctrines,\nand the heart of the unbeliever is not softened. To try to impress him\nis like striking upon cold iron....\nWe are in constant need of wisdom to know when to speak and[248]\nwhen to keep silent. But there is always perfect safety in talking\nof the hope of eternal life. And when the heart is all melted and\nsubdued by the love of Jesus, the inquiry will be, \u201cLord, what must\nI do to be saved?\u201d\u2014Letter 12, 1890.\nWisdom Required in Presenting Testing Truths\u2014Our growth\nhas been, in untried fields, generally slow because of the seventh-day\nSabbath. There stands a sharp cross directly in the way of every soul\nwho accepts the truth.\nThere are other truths, such as the nonimmortality of the soul\nand the personal coming of Christ in the clouds of heaven to our\nearth in a short time. But these are not as objectionable as the\nSabbath. Some will conscientiously accept the truth for its own\nsake, because it is Bible truth, and they love the path of obedience\nto all the commandments of God. These objectionable features of\nour faith will bar the way to many souls who do not wish to be a\npeculiar people, distinct and separate from the world. Therefore,\ngreat wisdom is required to be exercised in the matter of how the\ntruth is brought before the people. There are certain clearly defined\nends to gain at the very introduction of missionary effort. If the\nplans and methods had been of a different character, even if they\nPreaching on Nonimmortality 229\nnecessarily involved more outlay of means, there would have been\nfar better results.\u2014Letter 14, 1887.\nLay Off Combative Armor\u2014Some ministers, when they find\nbefore them unbelievers who are prejudiced against our views upon\nthe nonimmortality of the soul out of Christ, feel all stirred up to\ngive a discourse on that very subject. This the hearers are in no way\nprepared to receive, and it only increases their prejudice and stirs up\ntheir opposition. Thus all the good impressions that might have been [249]\nmade if the worker had pursued a wise course are lost. The hearers\nare confirmed in their unbelief. Hearts might have been won, but\nthe combative armor was put on. Strong meat was thrust upon them\nand the souls that might have been won were driven farther off than\nbefore.\nThe combative armor, the debating spirit, must be laid off. If we\nwould be Christlike we must reach men where they are.\u2014Manuscript\n104, 1898.\nCorrect Understanding Vital \u2014A correct understanding of\n\u201cwhat saith the Scriptures\u201d in regard to the state of the dead is\nessential for this time. God\u2019s Word declares that the dead know\nnot anything, their hatred and love have alike perished. We must\ncome to the sure word of prophecy for our authority. Unless we are\nintelligent in the Scriptures, may we not, when this mighty miracle-\nworking power of Satan is manifested in our world, be deceived and\ncall it the workings of God; for the Word of God declares that, if\nit were possible, the very elect should be deceived. Unless we are\nrooted and grounded in the truth, we shall be swept away by Satan\u2019s\ndelusive snares. We must cling to our Bibles. If Satan can make you\nbelieve that there are things in the Word of God that are not inspired,\nhe will then be prepared to ensnare your soul. We shall have no\nassurance, no certainty, at the very time we need to know what is\ntruth.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 18, 1888.\nThe Message of Christian Stewardship\nTeach Every Convert\u2014Every soul converted is to have the light\nin regard to the Lord\u2019s requirement for tithes and offerings. All that\nmen enjoy they receive from the Lord\u2019s great farm, and He is pleased\nto have His heritage enjoy His goods; but He has made a special[250]\ncontract with all who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince\nImmanuel, that they may show their dependence and accountability\nto God, by returning to His treasury a certain portion as His own.\nThis is to be invested in supporting the missionary work which must\nbe done to fulfill the commission given to them by the Son of God\njust before He left His disciples.\u2014Manuscript 123, 1898.\nEach a Link in Chain of Salvation\u2014He who becomes a child\nof God should henceforth look upon himself as a link in the chain\nlet down to save the world, one with Christ in His plan of mercy,\ngoing forth with Him to seek and save the lost.\u2014The Ministry of\nHealing, 105 (1905).\nEvangelists\u2019 Responsibility\u2014It is part of your work to teach\nthose whom you bring into the truth to bring the tithe into the\nstorehouse as an acknowledgment of their dependence on God. They\nshould be fully enlightened as to their duty to return to the Lord His\nown. The command to pay tithe is so plain that there is no semblance\nof excuse for disregarding it. If you neglect to give the new converts\ninstruction on this point, you leave undone a most important part of\nyour work.\u2014Letter 51, 1902.\nGuiding the New Church \u2014Never should the laborer who\nraises up little companies here and there, give the impression to\nthose newly come to the faith, that God does not require them to\nwork systematically in helping to sustain the cause by their personal\nlabors and by their means....\nAll should be taught to do what they can for the Master; to\nrender to Him according as He has prospered them. He claims as\nHis just due a tenth of their income, be it large or small; and those[251]\nwho withhold this, commit robbery toward Him and cannot expect\n230\nMessage of Christian Stewardship 231\nHis prospering hand to be with them. Even if the church is com-\nposed mostly of poor brethren, the subject of systematic benevolence\nshould be thoroughly explained, and the plan heartily adopted. God\nis able to fulfill His promises. His resources are infinite, and He\nemploys them all in accomplishing His will. And when He sees a\nfaithful performance of duty in the payment of the tithes, He often,\nin His wise providence, opens ways whereby it shall increase. He\nwho follows God\u2019s arrangement in the little that has been given him,\nwill receive the same returns as he who bestows of his abundance.\u2014\nGospel Workers, 222, 223 (1915).\nTest of Heavenly Fellowship \u2014Our heavenly Father bestows\ngifts and solicits a portion back, that He may test us whether we are\nworthy to have the gift of everlasting life.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 3:408 (1875).\nA Point to Be Presented Tactfully and Repeatedly\u2014Teachers\nof the Word of God are not to keep back any part of the counsel of\nGod, lest the people shall be ignorant of their duty, and not under-\nstand what is the will of God concerning them, and stumble and fall\ninto perdition....\nLet no one neglect to give faithful and plain instruction upon\ntithing. Let there be instruction as to giving to the Lord that which\nHe claims as His own; for the commendation of the Lord will not\nrest upon a people who rob Him in tithes and offerings. There will be\nneed of often setting before the people their duty on this matter that\nthey may render unto God His own. Let the one who first presents\nthe truth be faithful in presenting this matter and let him also who\nfollows up the interest also make plain the requirement of God on [252]\ntithing, that the people may see that in all points the laborers are\nteaching the same truth and are of one mind in urging them to yield\nobedience to all the requirements of God.\nBut let laborers have discretion and not give strong meat to those\nwho are babes; feed them with the sincere milk of the Word. In no\ncase mingle your own spirit and ideas with the truth and cover up\nthe precepts of God by traditions or suppositions. Let the people\nhave the truth as it is in Jesus.\u2014Manuscript 39, 1895.\nA Neglected Work\u2014We are to give the message of warning\nto the world, and how are we doing our work? Are you, brethren,\npreaching that part of the truth that pleases the people, while other\n232 Evangelism\nparts of the work are left incomplete? Will it be necessary for\nsomeone to follow after you, and urge upon the people the duty\nof faithfully bringing all the tithes and offerings into the Lord\u2019s\ntreasury? This is the work of the minister, but it has been sadly\nneglected. The people have robbed God, and the wrong has been\nsuffered because the minister did not want to displease his brethren.\nGod calls these men unfaithful stewards.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJuly 8, 1884.\nFaithful Tithe, Adequate Means\u2014Should means flow into the\ntreasury exactly according to God\u2019s plan,\u2014a tenth of all the in-\ncrease,\u2014there would be abundance to carry forward His work.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 5:150 (1882).\nIngathering for Missions \u2014In the providence of God, those\nwho are bearing the burden of His work have been endeavoring to\nput new life into old methods of labor, and also to invent new plans\nand new methods of awakening the interest of church members in a\nunited effort to reach the world. One of the new plans for reaching[253]\nunbelievers is the Harvest Ingathering campaign for missions. In\nmany places, during the past few years, this has proved a success,\nbringing blessing to many, and increasing the flow of means into\nthe mission treasury. As those not of our faith have been made\nacquainted with the progress of the third angel\u2019s message in heathen\nlands, their sympathies have been aroused, and some have sought\nto learn more of the truth that has such power to transform hearts\nand lives. Men and women of all classes have been reached, and the\nname of God has been glorified.\u2014Counsels on Stewardship, 190,\n191.\nAvoid Worldly Methods\u2014We see the churches of our day en-\ncouraging feasting, gluttony, and dissipation, by the suppers, fairs,\ndances, and festivals gotten up for the purpose of gathering means\ninto the church treasury. Here is a method invented by carnal minds\nto secure means without sacrificing....\nLet us stand clear of all these church corruptions, dissipations,\nand festivals, which have a demoralizing influence upon young and\nold. We have no right to throw over them the cloak of sanctity\nbecause the means is to be used for church purposes. Such offerings\nare lame and diseased, and bear the curse of God. They are the price\nof souls. The pulpit may defend festivals, dancing, lotteries, fairs,\nMessage of Christian Stewardship 233\nand luxurious feasts, to obtain means for church purposes; but let us\nparticipate in none of these things; for if we do, God\u2019s displeasure\nwill be upon us. We do not propose to appeal to the lust of the\nappetite or resort to carnal amusements as an inducement to Christ\u2019s\nprofessed followers to give of the means which God has entrusted to\nthem. If they do not give willingly, for the love of Christ, the offering\nwill in no case be acceptable to God.\u2014Counsels on Stewardship,\n201, 202 (1878).\nBribed by Feasting and Merriment \u2014It is a deplorable fact [254]\nthat sacred and eternal considerations do not have that power to\nopen the hearts of the professed followers of Christ to make freewill\nofferings to sustain the gospel, as the tempting bribes of feasting\nand general merriment. It is a sad reality that these inducements\nwill prevail when sacred and eternal things will have no force to\ninfluence the heart to engage in works of benevolence.\nThe plan of Moses in the wilderness to raise means was highly\nsuccessful. There was no compulsion necessary. Moses made no\ngrand feast. He did not invite the people to scenes of gaiety, dancing,\nand general amusement. Neither did he institute lotteries or anything\nof this profane order to obtain means to erect the tabernacle of God\nin the wilderness. God commanded Moses to invite the children of\nIsrael to bring the offerings. Moses was to accept gifts of every man\nthat gave willingly from his heart. These freewill offerings came\nin so great abundance that Moses proclaimed it was enough. They\nmust cease their presents; for they had given abundantly, more than\nthey could use.\u2014Counsels on Stewardship, 203 (1874).\nAnd what impression is made upon the minds of unbelievers?\nThe holy standard of the Word of God is lowered into the dust.\nContempt is cast upon God and upon the Christian name. The most\ncorrupt principles are strengthened by this un-Scriptural way of\nraising means. And this is as Satan would have it. Men are repeating\nthe sin of Nadab and Abihu. They are using common instead of\nsacred fire in the service of God. The Lord accepts no such offerings.\nAll these methods for bringing money into His treasury are an\nabomination to Him. It is a spurious devotion that prompts all\nsuch devising. O what blindness, what infatuation, is upon many\nwho claim to be Christians! Church members are doing as did the [255]\ninhabitants of the world in the days of Noah, when the imagination\n234 Evangelism\nof their hearts was only evil continually. All who fear God will\nabhor such practices as a misrepresentation of the religion of Jesus\nChrist.\u2014Counsels on Stewardship, 205 (1896).\nMan\u2019s Stewardship\u2014There is a yet deeper significance to the\ngolden rule. Everyone who has been made a steward of the manifold\ngrace of God, is called upon to impart to souls in ignorance and\ndarkness, even as, were he in their place, he would desire them to\nimpart to him. The apostle Paul said, \u201cI am debtor both to the Greeks\nand to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.\u201d By all that\nyou have known of the love of God, by all that you have received of\nthe rich gifts of His grace, above the most benighted and degraded\nsoul upon the earth, are you in debt to that soul to impart these gifts\nunto him.\u2014Mount of Blessing, p. 193. (1896).\nPresentation of the Spirit of Prophecy\nNew Believers to Have Clear Understanding \u2014As the end\ndraws near, and the work of giving the last warning to the world\nextends, it becomes more important for those who accept present\ntruth to have a clear understanding of the nature and influence of the\nTestimonies, which God in His providence has linked with the work\nof the third angel\u2019s message from its very rise.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 5:654 (1889).\nGod\u2019s Present-Day Instruction\u2014In ancient times God spoke\nto men by the mouth of prophets and apostles. In these days He\nspeaks to them by the testimonies of His Spirit. There was never [256]\na time when God instructed His people more earnestly than He\ninstructs them now concerning His will, and the course that He would\nhave them pursue.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:661 (1889).\nFrequently Neglected\u2014Ministers frequently neglect these im-\nportant branches of the work\u2014health reform, spiritual gifts, system-\natic benevolence, and the great branches of the missionary work.\nUnder their labors large numbers may embrace the theory of the\ntruth, but in time it is found that there are many who will not bear the\nproving of God. The minister laid upon the foundation, hay, wood,\nand stubble, which would be consumed by the fire of temptation.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, December 12, 1878.\nNot to Take Place of the Bible \u2014The testimonies of Sister\nWhite should not be carried to the front. God\u2019s Word is the unerring\nstandard. The Testimonies are not to take the place of the Word.\nGreat care should be exercised by all believers to advance these ques-\ntions carefully, and always stop when you have said enough. Let\nall prove their positions from the Scriptures and substantiate every\npoint they claim as truth from the revealed Word of God.\u2014Letter\n12, 1890.\nTestimonies Not Ahead of Bible \u2014The more we look at the\npromises of the Word of God, the brighter they grow. The more we\npractice them, the deeper will be our understanding of them. Our\n235\n236 Evangelism\nposition and faith is in the Bible. And never do we want any soul to\nbring in the Testimonies ahead of the Bible.\u2014Manuscript 7, 1894.\nPurpose of the Testimonies \u2014The Word of God is sufficient\nto enlighten the most beclouded mind, and may be understood by[257]\nthose who have any desire to understand it. But notwithstanding all\nthis, some who profess to make the Word of God their study, are\nfound living in direct opposition to its plainest teachings. Then, to\nleave men and women without excuse, God gives plain and pointed\ntestimonies, bringing them back to the Word that they have neglected\nto follow. The Word of God abounds in general principles for the\nformation of correct habits of living, and the Testimonies, general\nand personal, have been calculated to call their attention more espe-\ncially to these principles.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:663, 664\n(1889).\nThe Greater and Lesser Lights \u2014Little heed is given to the\nBible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women\nto the greater light.\u2014The Colporteur Evangelist, 37 (1902).\nIllustration: Presenting the Spirit of Prophecy\u2014Elder ____-\n_ enters into no controversy with opponents. He presents the Bible\nso clearly that it is evident that anyone who differs must do so in\nopposition to the Word of God.\nFriday evening and Sabbath forenoon he spoke upon the subject\nof spiritual gifts, dwelling especially upon the Spirit of prophecy.\nThose who were present at these discourses say that he treated the\nsubject in a clear, forceful manner.\u2014Letter 388, 1906.\nIn his teaching Elder _____ showed that the Spirit of prophecy\nhas an important part to act in the establishment of the truth. When\nbinding off his work, he called for me ... to speak to the people.\u2014\nLetter 400, 1906.\nGive Time to Weigh Evidence\u2014In the last vision given at Bat-\ntle Creek I was shown that an unwise course was taken at _____ in[258]\nregard to the visions at the time of the organization of the church\nthere. There were some in _____ who were God\u2019s children, and yet\ndoubted the visions. Others had no opposition, yet dared not take\na decided stand in regard to them. Some were skeptical, and they\nhad sufficient cause to make them so. The false visions and fanatical\nexercises, and the wretched fruits following, had an influence upon\nthe cause in _____, to make minds jealous of everything bearing\nPresentation of the Spirit of Prophecy 237\nthe name of visions. All these things should have been taken into\nconsideration, and wisdom exercised. There should be no trial or\nlabor with those who have never seen the individual having visions,\nand who have had no personal knowledge of the influence of the\nvisions. Such should not be deprived of the benefits and privileges\nof the church, if their Christian course is otherwise correct, and they\nhave formed a good Christian character.\nSome, I was shown, could receive the published visions, judging\nof the tree by its fruits. Others are like doubting Thomas; they cannot\nbelieve the published Testimonies, nor receive evidence through the\ntestimony of others, but must see and have the evidence for them-\nselves. Such must not be set aside, but long patience and brotherly\nlove should be exercised toward them until they find their position\nand become established for or against. If they fight against the\nvisions, of which they have no knowledge; if they carry their oppo-\nsition so far as to oppose that in which they have had no experience,\nand feel annoyed when those who believe that the visions are of\nGod speak of them in meeting, and comfort themselves with the\ninstruction given through vision, the church may know that they are\nnot right.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:327-329 (1862).\nDriven to a Premature Position\u2014I have been shown that some, [259]\nespecially in _____, make the visions a rule by which to measure\nall; and have taken a course which my husband and myself have\nnever pursued. Some are unacquainted with me and my labors, and\nthey are very skeptical of anything bearing the name of visions.\nThis is all natural, and can be overcome only by experience. If\npersons are not settled in regard to the visions, they should not\nbe crowded off. The course to pursue with such may be found in\nTestimony No. 8 [volume 1, pages 328, 329], which I hope will be\nread by all. Ministers should have compassion of some, making a\ndifference; others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire. God\u2019s\nministers should have wisdom to give to everyone his portion of\nmeat, and to make that difference with different persons which their\ncases require. The course pursued with some in _____ who are\nunacquainted with me, has not been careful and consistent. Those\nwho were, comparatively, strangers to the visions, have been dealt\nwith in the same manner as those who have had much light and\nexperience in the visions. Some have been required to indorse the\n238 Evangelism\nvisions when they could not conscientiously do so, and in this way\nsome honest souls have been driven to take positions against the\nvisions and against the body, which they never would have taken had\ntheir cases been managed with discretion and mercy.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 1:382, 383 (1863).\nOvercoming the Opposition\u2014The ministers (non-S.D.A.) are\nopening up their tirade, and against Mrs. White in particular. But\nthis is only hurting themselves.... I am placing Desire of Ages, Great\nControversy, Patriarchs and Prophets, and Christ Our Saviour in\nfamilies; so while the ministers are working against me, I will speak[260]\nin my writings to the people. I believe souls will be converted to the\ntruth. We are now turning them to the law and to the testimonies. If\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light\nin them.\u2014Letter 217, 1899.\nJudged by Their Fruits \u2014Let the Testimonies be judged by\ntheir fruits. What is the spirit of their teaching? What has been\nthe result of their influence? All who desire to do so can acquaint\nthemselves with the fruits of these visions....\nGod is either teaching His church, reproving their wrongs, and\nstrengthening their faith, or He is not. This work is of God, or it is\nnot. God does nothing in partnership with Satan. My work ... bears\nthe stamp of God, or the stamp of the enemy. There is no halfway\nwork in the matter. The Testimonies are of the Spirit of God, or of\nthe devil.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:671 (1889).\nGod Speaks Through Testimonies \u2014We must follow the di-\nrections given through the Spirit of prophecy. We must love and\nobey the truth for this time. This will save us from accepting strong\ndelusions. God has spoken to us through His Word. He has spoken\nto us through the Testimonies to the church, and through the books\nthat have helped to make plain our present duty and the position that\nwe should now occupy.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 8:298 (1904).\nPresenting Health and Christian Standards\n[See also The Medical Evangelist, 513-551 and pp. 657-665,\n\u201cHealth and Health Principles.\u201d]\nPresenting Health Reform\u2014Our work is to be practical. We\nare to remember that man has a body as well as a soul to save. Our [261]\nwork includes far more than standing before the people to preach to\nthem. In our work we are to minister to the physical infirmities of\nthose with whom we are brought in contact. We are to present the\nprinciples of health reform, impressing our hearers with the thought\nthat they have a part to act in keeping themselves in health.\nThe body must be kept in a healthy condition in order that the\nsoul may be in health. The condition of the body affects the condition\nof the soul. He who would have physical and spiritual strength must\neducate his appetite in right lines. He must be careful not to burden\nthe soul by overtaxing his physical or spiritual powers. Faithful\nadherence to right principles in eating, drinking, and dressing is a\nduty that God has laid upon human beings.\nThe Lord desires us to obey the laws of health and life. He holds\neach one responsible to care properly for his body, that it may be\nkept in health.\u2014Letter 123, 1903.\nA Part of the Last Message\u2014The principles of health reform\nare found in the Word of God. The gospel of health is to be firmly\nlinked with the ministry of the Word. It is the Lord\u2019s design that the\nrestoring influence of health reform shall be a part of the last great\neffort to proclaim the gospel message.\u2014Medical Ministry, 259.\nAs a people we have been given the work of making known\nthe principles of health reform. There are some who think that the\nquestion of diet is not of sufficient importance to be included in their\nevangelistic work. But such make a great mistake. God\u2019s Word\ndeclares, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do,\ndo all to the glory of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:31. The subject of\ntemperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the work [262]\nof salvation.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:112 (1909).\n239\n240 Evangelism\nFully Established in Health Reform \u2014Those who live in the\nlast days of this earth\u2019s history need to be fully established in the\nprinciples of health reform....\nSickly men and sickly women need to become health reformers.\nGod will co-operate with His children in preserving their health,\nif they eat with care, refusing to put unnecessary burdens on the\nstomach. He has graciously made the path of nature sure and safe,\nwide enough for all who will walk in it. He has given for our\nsustenance the wholesome and health-giving productions of the\nearth....\nMany have done the body much injury by a disregard of the laws\nof life, and they may never recover from the effects of their neglect;\nbut even now they may repent and be converted. Man has tried to be\nwiser than God. He has become a law unto himself. God calls upon\nus to give attention to His requirements, no longer to dishonor Him\nby dwarfing the physical, mental, and spiritual capabilities.\u2014Letter\n135, 1902.\nHealth Reform Progressive and Practical\u2014The Lord desires\nour ministers, physicians, and church members to be careful not to\nurge those who are ignorant of our faith to make sudden changes in\ndiet, thus bringing men to a premature test. Hold up the principles\nof health reform, and let the Lord lead the honest in heart. They\nwill hear and believe. Nor does the Lord require His messengers\nto present the beautiful truths of healthful living in a way that will\nprejudice minds. Let no one put stumbling blocks before the feet that\nare walking in the dark paths of ignorance. Even in praising a good\nthing, it is well not to be too enthusiastic, lest you turn out of the[263]\nway those who come to hear. Present the principles of temperance\nin their most attractive form.\nWe must not move presumptuously. The laborers who enter\nnew territory to raise up churches must not create difficulties by\nattempting to make prominent the question of diet. They should be\ncareful not to draw the lines too closely, for impediments would thus\nbe thrown in the pathway of others. Do not drive the people; lead\nthem.\nWherever the truth is carried, instruction should be given in\nregard to the preparation of wholesome foods. God desires that in\nevery place the people shall be taught by skillful teachers how to\nPresenting Health and Christian Standards 241\nutilize wisely the products that they can raise or readily obtain in\ntheir section of the country. Thus the poor, as well as those in better\ncircumstances, can be taught to live healthfully.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n233 (1915).\nKeep It to the Front\u2014The work of health reform is the Lord\u2019s\nmeans for lessening suffering in our world and for purifying His\nchurch. Teach the people that they can act as God\u2019s helping hand,\nby co-operating with the Master worker in restoring physical and\nspiritual health. This work bears the signature of heaven, and will\nopen doors for the entrance of other precious truths. There is room\nfor all to labor who will take hold of this work intelligently.\nKeep the work of health reform to the front, is the message I\nam instructed to bear. Show so plainly its value that a wide-spread\nneed for it will be felt. Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink\nis the fruit of true religion. He who is thoroughly converted will\nabandon every injurious habit and appetite. By total abstinence he\nwill overcome his desire for health-destroying indulgences.\nI am instructed to say to health-reform educators, Go forward. [264]\nThe world needs every jot of the influence you can exert to press\nback the tide of moral woe. Let those who teach the third angel\u2019s\nmessage stand true to their colors.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n9:112, 113 (1909).\nTotal Abstinence From Liquor and Tobacco \u2014Men and\nwomen have many habits that are antagonistic to the principles\nof the Bible. The victims of strong drink and tobacco are corrupted,\nbody, soul, and spirit. Such ones should not be received into the\nchurch until they give evidence that they are truly converted, that\nthey feel the need of the faith that works by love and purifies the\nsoul. The truth of God will purify the true believer. He who is\nthoroughly converted will abandon every defiling habit and appetite.\nBy total abstinence he will overcome his desire for health-destroying\nindulgences.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nConversion the Secret of Victory\u2014The very first and the most\nimportant thing is to melt and subdue the soul by presenting our Lord\nJesus Christ as the sinbearer, the sin-pardoning Saviour, making the\ngospel as clear as possible.\nWhen the Holy Spirit works among us, as it surely has done at the\ncamp meeting in _____, souls who are unready for Christ\u2019s appearing\n242 Evangelism\nare convicted. Many come to our meetings and are converted who\nfor years have not attended meetings in any church. The simplicity\nof the truth reaches their hearts. It touches all classes. The tobacco\ndevotees sacrifice their idol and the liquor drinker his liquor. They\ncould not do this if they did not grasp by faith the promises of God\nfor the forgiveness of their sins. Is it not worth a decided effort to[265]\nsave these souls?\u2014Letter 4, 1899.\nBegin Reform at the Foundation \u2014Liquor drinking encour-\nages the vilest debauchery and strengthens the most Satanic propen-\nsities.... As we face these things, and see the terrible consequences\nof liquor drinking, shall we not do all in our power to rally to the help\nof God in fighting against this great evil? At the foundation of liquor\ndrinking lie wrong habits of eating. Those who believe present truth\nshould refuse to drink tea or coffee, for these excite a desire for\nstronger stimulant. They should refuse to eat flesh meat, for this too\nexcites a desire for strong drink. Wholesome food, prepared with\ntaste and skill, should be our diet now.\nThose who are not health reformers treat themselves unfairly and\nunwisely. By the indulgence of appetite they do themselves fearful\ninjury. Some may think that the question of diet is not important\nenough to be included in the question of religion. But such make a\ngreat mistake. God\u2019s Word declares, \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or\ndrink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.\u201d The subject\nof temperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the\nworking out of our salvation. Because of wrong habits of eating, the\nworld is becoming more and more immoral.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nPersonal Labor for Intemperate\u2014Missionary work does not\nconsist merely of preaching. It includes personal labor for those\nwho have abused their health and have placed themselves where they\nhave not moral power to control their appetites and passions. These\nsouls are to be labored for as those more favorably situated. Our\nworld is full of suffering ones.\nGod has written His law upon every nerve and muscle, every[266]\nfiber and function of the human body. The indulgence of unnatural\nappetite, whether for tea, coffee, tobacco, or liquor, is intemperance,\nand is at war with the laws of life and health. By using these forbid-\nden articles a condition of things is created in the system which the\nCreator never designed. This indulgence in any of the members of\nPresenting Health and Christian Standards 243\nthe human family is sin.... The eating of food that does not make\ngood blood is working against the laws of our physical organism, and\nis a violation of the law of God. The cause produces the effect. Suf-\nfering, disease, and death are the sure penalty of indulgence.\u2014Letter\n123, 1899.\nThe Quest for Pleasure\u2014Multitudes are vainly seeking happi-\nness in worldly amusements. They crave something which they do\nnot have. They are spending their money for that which is not bread,\nand their labor for that which satisfieth not. The hungering, thirsting\nsoul will continue to hunger and thirst as long as it partakes of these\nunsatisfying pleasures. O that every such one would listen to the\nvoice of Jesus, \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\u201d\nThose who drink of the living water will thirst no more for frivolous,\nexciting amusements. Christ, the wellspring of life, is the fountain\nof peace and happiness.\nGod bestows various talents and gifts upon men, not that they\nmay lie useless, nor that they may be employed in amusements or\nselfish gratification, but that they may be a blessing to others by\nenabling men to do earnest, self-sacrificing missionary work.\u2014The\nYouth\u2019s Instructor, November 6, 1902.\nShows and Theaters\u2014Satan\u2019s ruling passion is to pervert the\nintellect and cause men to long for shows and theatrical perfor-\nmances. The experience and character of all who engage in this [267]\nwork will be in accordance with the food given to the mind.\nThe Lord has given evidence of His love for the world. There\nwas no falsity, no acting, in what He did. He gave a living gift,\ncapable of suffering humiliation, neglect, shame, reproach. This\nChrist did that He might rescue the fallen. While human beings\nwere instituting schemes and methods to destroy Him, the Son of\nthe Infinite God came to our world to give an example of the great\nwork to be done to redeem and save man. But today the proud and\ndisobedient are striving to acquire a great name and great honor\nfrom their fellow men by using their God-given endowments to\namuse.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1898.\nWorking for Pleasure Lovers\u2014Instead of disparaging Jacob\u2019s\nwell, Christ presented something infinitely better.... He offered the\nwoman something better than anything she possessed, even living\nwater, the joy and hope of the gospel of His kingdom.\n244 Evangelism\nThis is an illustration of the way in which we are to work. It\nis of little use for us to go to pleasure lovers, theatergoers, horse\nracers, drunkards, gamblers, and scathingly rebuke them for their\nsins. This will do no good. We must offer them something better\nthan that which they have, even the peace of Christ, which passeth\nall understanding....\nThese poor souls are engaged in a wild chase after worldly plea-\nsure and earthly riches. They have no knowledge of anything more\ndesirable. But games, theaters, horse races, will not satisfy the soul.\nHuman beings were not created to be satisfied in this way, to spend\ntheir money for that which is not bread. Show them how infinitely\nsuperior to the fleeting joys and pleasures of the world is the im-\nperishable glory of heaven. Seek to convince them of the freedom\nand hope and rest and peace there is in the gospel. \u201cWhosoever[268]\ndrinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst,\u201d Christ\ndeclared.\u2014Manuscript 12, 1901.\nInstructions on Dress and Pleasure \u2014The principles of the\nChristian life should be made plain to those who have newly come\nto the truth. Faithful, Christian men and women should have an\nintense interest to bring the convicted soul to a correct knowledge\nof righteousness in Christ Jesus. If any have allowed the desire for\npleasure or the love of dress to become supreme, so that any portion\nof their mind, soul, and strength is devoted to selfish indulgences,\nthe faithful believers should watch for these souls as they that must\ngive an account. They must not neglect the faithful, tender, loving\ninstruction so essential to the young converts, that there may be no\nhalf-hearted work.\u2014Manuscript 56, 1900.\nInstructing New Converts on Idolatry of Dress\u2014 One of the\npoints upon which those newly come to the faith will need instruction\nis the subject of dress. Let the new converts be faithfully dealt with.\nAre they vain in dress? Do they cherish pride of heart? The idolatry\nof dress is a moral disease. It must not be taken over into the new life.\nIn most cases, submission to the gospel requirements will demand a\ndecided change in the dress.\nThere should be no carelessness in dress. For Christ\u2019s sake,\nwhose witnesses we are, we should seek to make the best of our\nappearance. In the tabernacle service, God specified every detail\nconcerning the garments of those who ministered before Him. Thus\nPresenting Health and Christian Standards 245\nwe are taught that He has a preference in regard to the dress of\nthose who serve Him. Very specific were the directions given in\nregard to Aaron\u2019s robes, for his dress was symbolic. So the dress [269]\nof Christ\u2019s followers should be symbolic. In all things we are to be\nrepresentatives of Him. Our appearance in every respect should be\ncharacterized by neatness, modesty, and purity. But the Word of God\ngives no sanction to the making of changes in apparel merely for the\nsake of fashion,\u2014that we may appear like the world. Christians are\nnot to decorate the person with costly array or expensive ornaments.\nThe words of Scripture in regard to dress should be carefully\nconsidered. We need to understand that which the Lord of heaven\nappreciates in even the dressing of the body. All who are in earnest\nin seeking for the grace of Christ will heed the precious words of\ninstruction inspired by God. Even the style of the apparel will\nexpress the truth of the gospel.\nAll who study the life of Christ and practice His teachings will\nbecome like Christ. Their influence will be like His. They will\nreveal soundness of character. As they walk in the humble path of\nobedience, doing the will of God, they exert an influence that tells\nfor the advancement of the cause of God and the healthful purity\nof His work. In these thoroughly converted souls the world is to\nhave a witness to the sanctifying power of truth upon the human\ncharacter.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:96, 97 (1900).\nIn Keeping With Our Faith\u2014Self-denial in dress is a part of\nour Christian duty. To dress plainly, and abstain from display of\njewelry and ornaments of every kind is in keeping with our faith.\nAre we of the number who see the folly of worldlings in indulging\nin extravagance of dress as well as in love of amusements? If so, we\nshould be of that class who shun everything that gives sanction to\nthis spirit which takes possession of the minds and hearts of those\nwho live for this world only, and who have no thought or care for [270]\nthe next.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:366 (1875).\nConformity to Christ or the World\u2014A sister who had spent\nsome weeks at one of our institutions in _____, said that she felt\nmuch disappointed in what she saw and heard there.... Before accept-\ning the truth, she had followed the fashions of the world in her dress,\nand had worn costly jewelry and other ornaments; but upon deciding\nto obey the Word of God, she felt that its teachings required her to\n246 Evangelism\nlay aside all extravagant and superfluous adorning. She was taught\nthat Seventh-day Adventists did not wear jewelry, gold, silver, or\nprecious stones, and that they did not conform to worldly fashions in\ntheir dress. When she saw among those who profess the faith such a\nwide departure from Bible simplicity, she felt bewildered. Had they\nnot the same Bible which she had been studying, and to which she\nhad endeavored to conform her life? Had her past experience been\nmere fanaticism? Had she misinterpreted the words of the apostle,\n\u201cThe friendship of the world is enmity with God, for whosoever will\nbe a friend of the world is the enemy of God\u201d?\nMrs. D, a lady occupying a position in the institution, was visit-\ning at Sr. _____\u2019s room one day, when the latter took out of her trunk\na gold necklace and chain, and said she wished to dispose of this\njewelry and put the proceeds into the Lord\u2019s treasury. Said the other,\n\u201cWhy do you sell it? I would wear it if it was mine.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied\nSr. _____, \u201cwhen I received the truth, I was taught that all these\nthings must be laid aside. Surely they are contrary to the teachings of\nGod\u2019s Word.\u201d And she cited her hearer to the words of the apostles,\nPaul and Peter, upon this point, \u201cIn like manner, also, that women\nadorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and so-[271]\nbriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;\nbut, as becometh women professing godliness, with good works.\u201d\n\u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the\nhair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel. But let it\nbe the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even\nthe ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.\u201d\nIn answer, the lady displayed a gold ring on her finger, given\nher by an unbeliever, and said she thought it no harm to wear such\nornaments. \u201cWe are not so particular,\u201d said she, \u201cas formerly. Our\npeople have been overscrupulous in their opinions upon the subject\nof dress. The ladies of this institution wear gold watches and gold\nchains, and dress like other people. It is not good policy to be\nsingular in our dress; for we cannot exert so much influence.\u201d\nWe inquire, Is this in accordance with the teachings of Christ?\nAre we to follow the Word of God, or the customs of the world? Our\nsister decided that it was the safest to adhere to the Bible standard.\nWill Mrs. D and others who pursue a similar course be pleased to\nPresenting Health and Christian Standards 247\nmeet the result of their influence, in that day when every man shall\nreceive according to his works?\nGod\u2019s Word is plain. Its teachings cannot be mistaken. Shall we\nobey it, just as He has given it to us, or shall we seek to find how far\nwe can digress and yet be saved? Would that all connected with our\ninstitutions would receive and follow the divine light, and thus be\nenabled to transmit light to those who walk in darkness.\nConformity to the world is a sin which is sapping the spirituality\nof our people, and seriously interfering with their usefulness. It is [272]\nidle to proclaim the warning message to the world, while we deny\nit in the transactions of daily life.\u2014The Review and Herald, March\n28, 1882.\nA Work of the Heart\u2014There are many who try to correct the\nlife of others by attacking what they consider are wrong habits. They\ngo to those whom they think are in error, and point out their defects.\nThey say, \u201cYou don\u2019t dress as you should.\u201d They try to pick off the\nornaments, or whatever seems offensive, but they do not seek to\nfasten the mind to the truth. Those who seek to correct others should\npresent the attractions of Jesus. They should talk of His love and\ncompassion, present His example and sacrifice, reveal His Spirit,\nand they need not touch the subject of dress at all. There is no need\nto make the dress question the main point of your religion. There is\nsomething richer to speak of. Talk of Christ, and when the heart is\nconverted, everything that is out of harmony with the Word of God\nwill drop off. It is only labor in vain to pick leaves off a living tree.\nThe leaves will reappear. The ax must be laid at the root of the tree,\nand then the leaves will fall off, never to return.\nIn order to teach men and women the worthlessness of earthly\nthings, you must lead them to the living Fountain, and get them to\ndrink of Christ, until their hearts are filled with the love of God,\nand Christ is in them, a well of water springing up into everlasting\nlife.\u2014The Signs of the Times, July 1, 1889.\nCleanse the fountain, and the streams will be pure. If the heart\nis right, your words, your dress, your acts, will all be right.\u2014Testi-\nmonies For The Church 1:158 (1857).\nSimplicity of Dress\u2014We are nearing the close of this world\u2019s\nhistory. A plain, direct testimony is now needed, as given in the [273]\nWord of God, in regard to plainness of dress. This should be our\n248 Evangelism\nburden. But it is too late now to become enthusiastic in making a\ntest of this matter. The dress of our people should be made most\nsimply.... No one precise style has been given me as the exact rule\nto guide all in their dress....\nOur sisters should clothe themselves with modest apparel. They\nshould dress with simplicity. Your hats and dresses need not the\nextra trimmings that are put upon them. You are to be clothed with\nmodest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety. Give to the\nworld a living illustration of the inward adorning of the grace of\nGod. Let our sisters dress plainly, as many do, having the dress of\ngood material, durable, modest, appropriate for this age, and let not\nthe dress question fill the mind.\u2014Manuscript 97, 1908.\nThe Ordinances\nThe Two Monumental Pillars\u2014The ordinances of baptism and\nthe Lord\u2019s supper are two monumental pillars, one within and one\nwithout the church. Upon these ordinances Christ has inscribed the\nname of the true God.\u2014Manuscript 27a, 1900.\nThe Lord\u2019s Supper a Continuing Memorial \u2014The symbols\nof the Lord\u2019s house are simple and plainly understood, and the\ntruths represented by them are of the deepest significance to us. In\ninstituting the sacramental service to take the place of the Passover,\nChrist left for His church a memorial of His great sacrifice for man.\n\u201cThis do,\u201d He said, \u201cin remembrance of Me.\u201d This was the point of\ntransition between two economies and their two great festivals. The\none was to close forever; the other, which He had just established, [274]\nwas to take its place, and to continue through all time as the memorial\nof His death.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 22, 1897.\nFeet Washing More Than a Form \u2014We do not come to the\nordinances of the Lord\u2019s house merely as a form....\nHe has instituted this service, that it may speak constantly to our\nsenses of the love of God that has been expressed in our behalf....\nThis service cannot be repeated without one thought linking itself\nwith another. Thus a chain of thought calls up remembrances of\nblessings, of kindnesses, and of favors received from friends and\nbrethren, that have passed out of mind. The Holy Spirit, with its\nquickening, vivifying power, presents the ingratitude and lack of\nlove that have sprung from the hateful root of bitterness. Link after\nlink of memory\u2019s chain is strengthened. The Spirit of God is at\nwork upon human minds. The defects of character, the neglect of\nduties, the ingratitude to God, are brought to the remembrance, and\nthe thoughts are brought into captivity to Christ.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, June 7, 1898.\nHeart Preparation\u2014In the early days of the advent movement,\nwhen our numbers were few, the celebration of the ordinances was\nmade a most profitable occasion. On the Friday before, every church\n249\n250 Evangelism\nmember endeavored to clear away everything that would tend to\nseparate him from his brethren and from God. Hearts were closely\nsearched; prayers for a divine revelation of hidden sin were earnestly\noffered; confessions of overreaching in trade, of ill-advised words\nhastily spoken, of sins cherished, were made. The Lord came near,\nand we were greatly strengthened and encouraged.\u2014Manuscript\n102, 1904.\nThe Purpose of the Ordinance of Service\u2014Reconciliation one[275]\nwith another is the work for which the ordinance of feet washing\nwas instituted. By the example of our Lord and Master, this humili-\nating ceremony has been made a sacred ordinance. Whenever it is\ncelebrated, Christ is present by His Holy Spirit. It is this Spirit that\nbrings conviction to hearts.\nAs Christ celebrated this ordinance with His disciples, conviction\ncame to the hearts of all save Judas. So we shall be convicted as\nChrist speaks to our hearts. The fountains of the soul will be broken\nup. The mind will be energized, and, springing into activity and\nlife, will break down every barrier that has caused disunion and\nalienation. Sins that have been committed will appear with more\ndistinctness than ever before; for the Holy Spirit will bring them to\nour remembrance. The words of Christ, \u201cIf ye know these things,\nhappy are ye if ye do them,\u201d will be clothed with new power.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, November 4, 1902.\nTest of the Heart\u2014This ordinance of feet washing was made a\nreligious service.... It was given as something to test and prove the\nloyalty of the children of God. When modern Israel observes the\nsacramental ordinance, this ceremony should precede the partaking\nof the emblems of the Lord\u2019s death.\nThis ordinance was given for the benefit of Christ\u2019s disciples.\nAnd Christ meant all that He said when His lips uttered the words,\n\u201cI have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to\nyou.... If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.\u201d He\ndesigned by this to test the true state of the heart and mind of those\nwho participated therein.\u2014Manuscript 8, 1897.\nFor All Time in Every Country\u2014In the place of the national\nfestival which the Jewish people had observed, He instituted a memo-[276]\nrial service, the ordinance of feet washing and the sacramental sup-\nper, to be observed through all time by His followers in every country.\nOrdinances 251\nThese should ever repeat Christ\u2019s act, that all may see that true ser-\nvice calls for unselfish ministry.\u2014The Signs of the Times, May 16,\n1900.\nTo Be Often Commemorated\u2014In this last act of Christ in par-\ntaking with His disciples of the bread and wine, He pledged Himself\nto them as their Redeemer by a new covenant, in which it was writ-\nten and sealed that upon all who will receive Christ by faith will be\nbestowed all the blessings that heaven can supply, both in this life\nand in the future immortal life.\nThis covenant deed was to be ratified by Christ\u2019s own blood,\nwhich it had been the office of the old sacrificial offerings to keep\nbefore the minds of His chosen people. Christ designed that this\nsupper should be often commemorated, in order to bring to our\nremembrance His sacrifice in giving His life for the remission of the\nsins of all who will believe on Him and receive Him. This ordinance\nis not to be exclusive, as many would make it. Each must participate\nin it publicly, and thus say: \u201cI accept Christ as my personal Saviour.\nHe gave His life for me, that I might be rescued from death.\u201d\u2014The\nReview and Herald, June 22, 1897.\nExperience: Dealing Faithfully With an Interested Minis-\nter\u2014Sabbath morning, when the church at _____ celebrated the\nordinances, Brother _____ was present. He was invited to unite in\nthe ordinance of feet washing, but said he preferred to witness it.\nHe asked if participation in this ordinance was required before one\ncould partake of communion, and was assured by our brethren that\nit was not obligatory, and that he would be welcome to the table of [277]\nthe Lord. This Sabbath was a most precious day to his soul; he said\nthat he had never had a happier day in his life.\nHe afterward desired an interview with me, and we had a pleasant\nvisit. His conversation was very interesting, and we had a precious\nseason of prayer together. I believe that he is a servant of God. I\ngave him my books Great Controversy, Patriarchs and Prophets,\nand Steps to Christ. He seemed much pleased, said he wanted all\nthe light he could get in order to meet the opponents of our faith. He\nwas baptized before leaving for his home, and will return to present\nthe truth to his own congregation.\u2014Letter 23a, 1893.\nNot Close Communion\u2014Christ\u2019s example forbids exclusive-\nness at the Lord\u2019s supper. It is true that open sin excludes the guilty.\n252 Evangelism\nThis the Holy Spirit plainly teaches. But beyond this none are to\npass judgment. God has not left it with men to say who shall present\nthemselves on these occasions. For who can read the heart? Who\ncan distinguish the tares from the wheat?\u2014The Desire of Ages, 656\n(1898).\nThere may come in among you those who are not in heart united\nwith truth and holiness, but who may wish to take part in these\nservices. Forbid them not.\u2014Manuscript 47, 1897.\nWith Reverence\u2014Everything connected with it should suggest\nas perfect a preparation as possible. Every ordinance of the church\nshould be uplifting. They should not be made common or cheap, or\nplaced on a level with common things.... Our churches need to be\neducated to a higher order of reverence and respect for the sacred\nservice of God.\u2014Manuscript 76, 1900.\nThis ceremony is not to be performed listlessly, but earnestly,[278]\nkeeping in view its purpose and object.\u2014Manuscript 8, 1897.\nA Blessed Meeting\u2014This day has been a most precious season\nof refreshment to my soul. The little company here are organized\ninto a church, and I met with them to celebrate the ordinances. I\nspoke from John 13, and precious ideas were impressed upon my\nmind in regard to the ordinance of humility.... There is much in\nthis simple rite that is not seen and appreciated. I was blessed in\npartaking of the symbols of the broken body and spilled blood of\nour precious Saviour, who became sin for us, that we might become\nthe righteousness of God in Him. He was our sin bearer.\nThe meeting today was a very solemn occasion for all present.\nThe testimony meeting was excellent. Everyone whose name was\ncalled responded willingly. I know that the Lord Jesus was in the\nmidst of us, and all heaven was pleased as we followed the example\nof Christ. On these occasions the Lord manifests Himself in a special\nmanner to so soften and subdue the soul, to expel selfishness, to\nimbue with His Holy Spirit, and to bring love and grace and peace\ninto hearts that are contrite.\nAs the meeting closed, and we turned to our tents in the woods,\na soft, sweet, holy influence pervaded our hearts. My soul was filled\nwith sweet peace.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1895.\nSection 9\u2014Clinching the Interest [279]\nPreaching for the Final Decision\nBy Simple Lessons\u2014Not Eloquence\u2014He who in his preach-\ning makes eloquence his highest aim, causes the people to forget the\ntruth that is mingled with his oratory. When the emotion has passed\naway, it will be found that the Word of God has not been fastened\nupon the mind, nor have the hearers gained in understanding. They\nmay speak in terms of admiration of the minister\u2019s eloquence, but\nthey are not brought any nearer to the point of decision. They speak\nof the sermon as they would of a play, and of the minister as they\nwould of an actor. They may come again to listen to the same kind\nof discourse, but they will go away unimpressed and unfed.\nIt is not flowery discourses that are needed, not a flood of words\nwithout meaning. Our ministers are to preach in a way that will help\npeople to grasp vital truth.\u2014Gospel Workers, 153, 154 (1915).\nUndecided Souls in Every Meeting\u2014There are souls in every\ncongregation who are hesitating, almost persuaded to be wholly for\nGod. The decision is being made for time and for eternity; but it is\ntoo often the case that the minister has not the spirit and power of\nthe message of truth in his own heart, hence no direct appeals are\nmade to those souls that are trembling in the balance. The result is\nthat impressions are not deepened upon the hearts of the convicted[280]\nones; and they leave the meeting feeling less inclined to accept the\nservice of Christ than when they came. They decide to wait for a\nmore favorable opportunity; but it never comes.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 4:447 (1880).\nSome Listening to Their Last Sermon\u2014Some may be listen-\ning to the last sermon they will ever hear, and some will never again\nbe so situated that they can have the chain of truth brought before\nthem, and a practical application made of it to their hearts. That\ngolden opportunity lost, is lost forever. Had Christ and His redeem-\ning love been exalted in connection with the theory of truth, it might\nhave balanced them on His side.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n4:394 (1880).\n254\nPreaching for the Final Decision 255\nAn Appeal in Every Sermon \u2014With an unction of the Holy\nSpirit upon him, giving him a burden for souls, he will not dismiss\na congregation without presenting before them Jesus Christ, the\nsinner\u2019s only refuge, making earnest appeals that will reach their\nhearts. He should feel that he may never meet these hearers again\nuntil the great day of God.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:316\n(1879).\nIn every discourse fervent appeals should be made to the people\nto forsake their sins and turn to Christ.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n4:396 (1880).\nCall for Decisions\u2014At our camp meetings there are far too few\nrevival efforts made. There is too little seeking of the Lord. Revival\nservices should be carried from the beginning to the close of the\nmeeting. The most determined efforts should be made to arouse\nthe people. Let all see that you are in earnest because you have a\nwonderful message from heaven. Tell them that the Lord is coming\nin judgment, and that neither kings nor rulers, wealth nor influence,\nwill avail to ward off the judgments soon to fall. At the close of [281]\nevery meeting, decisions should be called for.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 6:64, 65 (1900).\nSabbath Truth Boldly Proclaimed\u2014It is at this time that the\ntrue Sabbath must be brought before the people both by pen and by\nvoice. As the fourth commandment of the Decalogue and those who\nobserve it are ignored and despised, the faithful few know that it\nis the time not to hide their face but to exalt the law of Jehovah by\nunfurling the banner on which is inscribed the message of the third\nangel, \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments of God, and the\nfaith of Jesus.\u201d Revelation 14:12....\nThe truth must not be hid, it must not be denied or disguised, but\nfully avowed, and boldly proclaimed.\u2014Letter 3, 1890.\nTwo Extremes Affecting Decision\u2014There are two extremes to\nbe avoided, one is the shunning to declare the whole counsel of God,\nand running into the spirit of revivalists in this age of crying, \u201cPeace,\npeace; when there is no peace,\u201d and weaving into the labors an\nelement which moves the feelings and leaves the heart unchanged....\nThe second extreme is to be always hammering at the people\nand in a harsh un-Christlike manner talking in a way that they think\nyou are provoked.\u2014Letter 43, 1886.\n256 Evangelism\nMinister\u2019s Presentation May Mar Decision \u2014In the past the\nwork of Brother _____ has been represented to me in figures. It has\nseemed as if he was holding out to the people a vessel filled with\nmost beautiful fruit, but that while offering this fruit to them, his\nattitude and manner were such that no one wanted any. Thus it has\ntoo often been with the spiritual truths that he offers to the people.[282]\nIn his presentation of these truths, a spirit sometimes crops out that\nis not heaven born. Words are sometimes spoken, reproofs given,\nwith a drive, a vim, that causes the people to turn away from the\nbeautiful truths that he has for them.\nI have seen Brother _____ when the melting Spirit of God was\nupon him. His love for the truth was genuine, and not something that\nhe merely claimed to possess. He had cultivated and cherished this\nlove, and it is still within his heart. But our brother has a very poor\nway of manifesting the compassion, the tenderness, the lovable spirit\nof Christ.... He is in need of the holy oil that is poured out of the\ngolden pipes into the hearts of men. This oil is to fill his heart, and\nwhen he receives it, the Spirit of God will be upon him.\u2014Manuscript\n120, 1902.\nRejection of Light Serious\u2014When conviction is disregarded,\nwhen evidence is rejected, men are forced to take a position of active\nopposition and stubborn resistance.\u2014Manuscript 13, 1892.\nAn Earnest Work for Souls\u2014Work for the salvation of souls\nas though you knew by sight that you were in full view of the whole\nuniverse of heaven. Every angel in glory is interested in the work\nbeing done for the salvation of souls. We are not awake as we should\nbe. All the angelic host are our helpers. \u201cThe Lord thy God in the\nmidst of thee is mighty; He will save, He will rejoice over thee with\njoy; He will rest in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.\u201d O\ncannot we then work with courage and faith. \u201cIn that day it will be\nsaid to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, Let not thine hands\nbe slack.\u201d Only have faith. Pray and believe, and ye shall see the\nsalvation of God.\u2014Letter 126, 1896.\nAppeals and Altar Calls [283]\nUrging Souls to Decide \u2014It is the work of the Holy Spirit to\nconvince the soul of its need of Christ. Many are convicted of sin,\nand feel their need of a sin-pardoning Saviour; but they are merely\ndissatisfied with their pursuits and aims, and if there is not a decided\napplication of the truth to their hearts, if words are not spoken at\nthe right moment, calling for decision from the weight of evidence\nalready presented, the convicted ones pass on without identifying\nthemselves with Christ, the golden opportunity passes, and they\nhave not yielded, and they go farther and farther away from the truth,\nfarther away from Jesus and never take their stand on the Lord\u2019s\nside.\nNow the minister is not merely to present the Word of God in\nsuch a manner as to convince of sin in a general way, but he is to\nlift up Christ before his hearers. Christ\u2019s claims upon them are to be\nmade plain. The people should be urged to decide just now to be on\nthe Lord\u2019s side.\u2014Letter 29, 1890.\nSecuring Audience Response\u2014Elder _____ has had wonderful\nsuccess in this series of meetings. His method has been to make\nscripture explain scripture; and the Holy Spirit has convinced many\nhearts of the truth. The people can but accept a plain Thus saith the\nLord.... He has lectured only in the evening, when men are released\nfrom their work and can come out to hear. After a few weeks of\nlabor he presented the Sabbath, again making the Bible prove every\nstatement.\nThe first meeting on Sabbath was held in the large tent. After\nElder _____ had finished speaking, there was a social meeting,\nand then he asked all who were convinced of the truth and were\ndetermined to take their stand to obey the Word of God, to rise to\ntheir feet. Fifty responded; their names were taken and a meeting [284]\nappointed in which they should bear their testimony. Many had\nexcellent words to speak....\n257\n258 Evangelism\nAfter several weeks had passed, another call was made for those\nwho had decided to obey the truth. Between twenty-five and thirty\nresponded. Several ministers were present at this meeting and bore\nexcellent testimonies.\u2014Letter 372, 1906.\nAudience Response to Truth in 1844 Movement\u2014This is the\nmanner in which it was proclaimed in 1842, 1843, and 1844.... No\nunnecessary words were uttered by the speaker, but the Scripture\nwas clearly presented. Frequently a call would be made for those\nwho believed the truths that were proved by the Word, to rise to\ntheir feet, and large numbers would respond. Prayers were offered\nin behalf of those who wished special help.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1906.\nRecognizing Fresh Displays of Conviction\u2014To my minister-\ning brethren I would say: Every fresh display of the conviction of\nthe grace of God upon the souls of unbelievers, is divine. Everything\nthat you can do to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth, is a means\nof allowing the light to shine, the light of the glory of God, as it\nshines in the face of Jesus Christ. Direct the mind to Him who guides\nand controls all things. Christ will be the manna and the spiritual\ndew to these newly converted souls. In Him is no darkness at all.\nAs men of spiritual understanding conduct Bible studies with them,\ntelling them how to yield to the power of the Holy Spirit, that they\nmay be fully and firmly established in the truth, the power of God\nwill be revealed.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1906.\nFrequent Public Calls \u2014Throw off all appearance of apathy,\nand lead the people to think that there is life or death in these solemn\nquestions, according as they shall receive or reject them. As you[285]\npresent testing truth, ask often, who is now willing, as they have\nheard the words of God, pointing out their duty, to consecrate their\nhearts and minds, with all their affections, to Christ Jesus.\u2014Letter\n8, 1895.\nPersonally Speak to Inquirers \u2014After the meetings are\nthrough, there should be a personal investigation with each one\non the ground. Each one should be asked how he is going to take\nthese things, if he is going to make a personal application of them.\nAnd then you should watch and see if there is an interest in this one\nor that. Five words spoken to them privately will do more than the\nwhole discourse has done.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nAppeals and Altar Calls 259\nHoly Spirit Makes Appeals Effective \u2014If you will seek the\nLord, putting away all evil speaking and all selfishness, and con-\ntinuing instant in prayer, the Lord will draw nigh to you. It is the\npower of the Holy Spirit that gives efficacy to your efforts and your\nappeals. Humble yourselves before God, that in His strength you\nmay rise to a higher standard.\u2014Manuscript 20, 1905.\nLove of Jesus Moves Hearts\u2014God and His beloved Son must\nbe presented before the people in the wealth of the love they have\nevidenced for man. In order to break down the barriers of prejudice\nand impenitence the love of Christ must have a part in every dis-\ncourse. Make men to know how much Jesus loves them, and what\nevidences He has given them of His love. What love can equal that\nwhich God has manifested for man by the death of Christ on the\ncross. When the heart is filled with the love of Jesus, this can be\npresented to the people and it will affect hearts.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nHelping Souls to Be Converted[286]\nThe Experience of Genuine Conversion\u2014I have been shown\nthat many have confused ideas in regard to conversion. They have\noften heard the words repeated from the pulpit, \u201cYe must be born\nagain.\u201d \u201cYou must have a new heart.\u201d These expressions have per-\nplexed them. They could not comprehend the plan of salvation.\nMany have stumbled to ruin because of the erroneous doctrines\ntaught by some ministers concerning the change that takes place\nat conversion. Some have lived in sadness for years, waiting for\nsome marked evidence that they were accepted by God. They have\nseparated themselves in a large measure from the world, and find\npleasure in associating with the people of God; yet they dare not\nprofess Christ, because they fear it would be presumption to say that\nthey are children of God. They are waiting for that peculiar change\nthat they have been led to believe is connected with conversion.\nAfter a time some of these do receive evidence of their accep-\ntance with God, and are then led to identify themselves with His\npeople. And they date their conversion from this time. But I have\nbeen shown that they were adopted into the family of God before\nthat time. God accepted them when they became weary of sin, and\nhaving lost their desire for worldly pleasures, resolved to seek God\nearnestly. But, failing to understand the simplicity of the plan of\nsalvation, they lost many privileges and blessings which they might\nhave claimed had they only believed, when they first turned to God,\nthat He had accepted them.\nOthers fall into a more dangerous error. They are governed by\nimpulse. Their sympathies are stirred, and they regard this flight\nof feeling as an evidence that they are accepted by God and are[287]\nconverted. But the principles of their life are not changed. The\nevidences of a genuine work of grace on the heart are to be found\nnot in feeling, but in the life. \u201cBy their fruits,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cye\nshall know them.\u201d\n260\nHelping Souls to Be Converted 261\nMany precious souls, desiring earnestly to be Christians, are yet\nstumbling in darkness, waiting for their feelings to be powerfully\nexercised. They look for a special change to take place in their\nfeelings. They expect some irresistible force, over which they have\nno control, to overpower them. They overlook the fact that the\nbeliever in Christ is to work out his salvation with fear and trembling.\nThe convicted sinner has something to do besides repent; he\nmust act his part in order to be accepted by God. He must believe\nthat God accepts his repentance, according to His promise. \u201cWithout\nfaith it is impossible to please Him: for He that cometh to God must\nbelieve that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently\nseek Him.\u201d\nThe work of grace upon the heart is not an instantaneous work. It\nis effected by continuous, daily watching and believing the promises\nof God. The repentant, believing one, who cherishes faith and\nearnestly desires the renewing grace of Christ, God will not turn\naway empty. He will give him grace. And ministering angels will\naid him as he perseveres in his efforts to advance.\u2014Manuscript 55,\n1910.\nConversions\u2014Not All Alike \u2014All are not constituted alike.\nConversions are not all alike. Jesus impresses the heart, and the\nsinner is born again to new life. Often souls have been drawn to\nChrist when there was no violent conviction, no soul rending, no\nremorseful terrors. They looked upon an uplifted Saviour; they lived.\nThey saw the soul\u2019s need; they saw the Saviour\u2019s sufficiency and His [288]\nclaims; they heard His voice saying, \u201cFollow Me,\u201d and they rose up\nand followed Him. This conversion was genuine, and the religious\nlife was just as decided as was that of others who suffered all the\nagony of a violent process.\u2014Letter 15a, 1890.\nConversions Not Precise and Methodical \u2014Those men who\ncalculate just how religious exercises should be conducted, and are\nvery precise and methodical in diffusing the light and grace that they\nseem to have, simply do not have much of the Holy Spirit....\nThough we cannot see the Spirit of God, we know that men who\nhave been dead in trespasses and sins, become convicted and con-\nverted under its operations. The thoughtless and wayward become\nserious. The hardened repent of their sins, and the faithless believe.\nThe gambler, the drunkard, the licentious, become steady, sober,\n262 Evangelism\nand pure. The rebellious and obstinate become meek and Christlike.\nWhen we see these changes in the character, we may be assured that\nthe converting power of God has transformed the entire man. We\nsaw not the Holy Spirit, but we saw the evidence of its work on the\nchanged character of those who were hardened and obdurate sinners.\nAs the wind moves in its force upon the lofty trees and brings them\ndown, so the Holy Spirit can work upon human hearts, and no finite\nman can circumscribe the work of God.\nThe Spirit of God is manifested in different ways upon different\nmen. One under the movings of this power will tremble before the\nWord of God. His convictions will be so deep that a hurricane and\ntumult of feeling seem to rage in his heart, and his whole being is\nprostrate under the convicting power of the truth. When the Lord\nspeaks forgiveness to the repenting soul, he is full of ardor, full of[289]\nlove to God, full of earnestness and energy, and the life-giving spirit\nwhich he has received cannot be repressed. Christ is in him a well\nof water springing up into everlasting life. His feelings of love are\nas deep and ardent as was his distress and agony. His soul is like\nthe fountain of the great deep, broken up, and he pours forth his\nthanksgiving and praise, his gratitude and joy, until the heavenly\nharps are tuned to notes of rejoicing. He has a story to tell, but not\nin any precise, common, methodical way. He is a soul ransomed\nthrough the merits of Jesus Christ, and his whole being is thrilled\nwith the realization of the salvation of God.\nOthers are brought to Christ in a more gentle way. \u201cThe wind\nbloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but\ncanst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every\none that is born of the Spirit.\u201d You cannot see the operating agency,\nbut you can see its effects. When Nicodemus said unto Jesus, \u201cHow\ncan these things be?\u201d Jesus said to him, \u201cArt thou a master of Israel,\nand knowest not these things?\u201d A teacher in Israel, a man among\nwise men, a man who supposed that he was able to comprehend the\nscience of religion, and yet stumbling at the doctrine of conversion!\nHe was not willing to admit truth, because he could not understand\nall that was connected with the operation of the power of God, and\nyet he accepted the facts of nature although he could not explain\nor even comprehend them. Like others of all ages, he was looking\nto forms and precise ceremonies as more essential to religion than\nHelping Souls to Be Converted 263\nthe deep movements of the Spirit of God.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMay 5, 1896.\nConversion Leads On to Obedience \u2014The conversion of the\nhuman soul is of no little consequence. It is the greatest miracle [290]\nperformed by divine power. Actual results are to be reached through\na belief in Christ as a personal Saviour. Purified by obedience to the\nlaw of God, sanctified by a perfect observance of His holy Sabbath,\ntrusting, believing, patiently waiting, and earnestly working out\nour own salvation with fear and trembling, we shall learn that it is\nGod that worketh in us to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u2014\nManuscript 6, 1900.\nSanctification Only Through Practicing the Truth \u2014Man\nmust not only read the Word of God, supposing that a casual knowl-\nedge of this Word will bring about in him a reformation of character.\nThis work only the One who is the way, the truth, and the life can\naccomplish. Firmly may certain doctrines of truth be held. Again\nand again they may be reiterated, till the holders come to think that\nthey are indeed in possession of the great blessings which these\ndoctrines represent. But the greatest, most powerful truths may be\nheld, and yet kept in the outer court, exerting little influence to make\nthe daily life wholesome and fragrant. The soul is not sanctified\nthrough the truth that is not practiced.\u2014Letter 16, 1892.\nDoctrines or Church Membership Do Not Take Place of\nConversion\u2014All, high or low, if they are unconverted, are on one\ncommon platform. Men may turn from one doctrine to another. This\nis being done, and will be done. Papists may change from Catholi-\ncism to Protestantism; yet they may know nothing of the meaning\nof the words, \u201cA new heart also will I give you.\u201d Accepting new\ntheories, and uniting with a church, do not bring new life to anyone,\neven though the church with which he unites may be established\non the true foundation. Connection with a church does not take the\nplace of conversion. To subscribe the name to a church creed is not [291]\nof the least value to anyone if the heart is not truly changed....\nWe must have more than an intellectual belief in the truth. Many\nof the Jews were convinced that Jesus was the Son of God, but\nthey were too proud and ambitious to surrender. They decided to\nresist the truth, and they maintained their opposition. They did not\nreceive into the heart the truth as it is in Jesus. When truth is held\n264 Evangelism\nas truth only by the conscience, when the heart is not stimulated\nand made receptive, only the mind is affected. But when the truth is\nreceived as truth by the heart, it has passed through the conscience,\nand has captivated the soul with its pure principles. It is placed in\nthe heart by the Holy Spirit, who reveals its beauty to the mind, that\nits transforming power may be seen in the character.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, February 14, 1899.\nConversion the Result of United Effort\u2014In the recovering of\nlost, perishing souls, it is not man that effects the work of saving\nsouls, it is God who labors with him. God works and man works.\n\u201cYe are laborers together with God.\u201d We must work in different ways\nand devise different methods, and let God work in us to the revealing\nof truth and Himself as the sin-pardoning Saviour.\u2014Letter 20, 1893.\nHelping the Sinner Across the Line\u2014Be instant in season and\nout of season, warning the young, pleading with sinners, with the\nlove for them that Christ has. When there comes from the lips of\nthe sinner the cry, \u201cOh, my sins, my sins, I fear that they are too\ngrievous to be forgiven,\u201d encourage faith. Hold Jesus up higher and\nstill higher, saying, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which taketh away\nthe sin of the world.\u201d When the cry is heard, \u201cGod be merciful to me\na sinner,\u201d point the trembling soul to a sin-pardoning Saviour as a[292]\nrefuge.\u2014Manuscript 138, 1897.\nAngels Rejoice\u2014The conversion of souls to God is the greatest\nwork, the highest work, in which human beings can have a part. In\nthe conversion of souls God\u2019s forbearance, His unbounded love, His\nholiness, His power, are revealed. Every true conversion glorifies\nHim, and causes the angels to break forth into singing. \u201cMercy and\ntruth have met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each\nother.\u201d\u2014Letter 121, 1902.\nGathering in the Interested\nMany Looking Wistfully to Heaven\u2014All over the world men\nand women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and\ninquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy\nSpirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be\ngathered in.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles, 109 (1911).\nGo After the Lost\u2014When we engage with all our hearts in the\nwork, we are closely allied to the angels; we are co-workers with\nthe angels and with Christ; and there is a sympathy with heaven and\nwith us, a holy, elevated sympathy. We are brought a little closer\nto heaven, a little closer to the angelic hosts, a little closer to Jesus.\nThen let us engage in this work with all our energies.\nDo not become weary in the work. God will help us. Angels will\nhelp us; because it is their work, and the very work they are seeking\nto inspire us with....\nThis is a work you must take hold of earnestly; and when you\nfind a wandering sheep, call him to the fold; and leave him not until\nyou see him safely enfolded there. May Heaven let the Spirit that\nwas in our divine Lord rest upon us. This is what we want. He tells [293]\nus, \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you.\u201d Go out for the lost sheep\nof the house of Israel.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1877.\nTake Hold of Christ and Draw Men\u2014With one hand the work-\ners would take hold of Christ, while with the other they would grasp\nsinners and draw them to the Saviour.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nSeptember 10, 1903.\nHave faith and hope, and draw, yes, draw souls to the gospel\nbanquet.\u2014Letter 112, 1902.\nMay Not Reach Them Again\u2014It is as much our duty to look at\nthe afterinterests of a camp meeting as it is to look after the present\ninterests, because the next time you go, if they were impressed and\nconvicted, and did not yield to that conviction, it is harder to make\nan impression on their minds than it was before, and you cannot\nreach them again.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\n265\n266 Evangelism\nGetting Decision Now Difficult \u2014In our day it is a difficult\nmatter to bring those who profess to believe the truth to the experi-\nmental knowledge of its vitalizing, sanctifying power. This has been\nexperienced in years gone by, but form has taken the place of the\npower, and its simplicity has been lost in a round of ceremonies.\u2014\nManuscript 104, 1898.\nA Parable\u2014Gathering the Ripening Fruitage \u2014In a dream\ngiven me September 29, 1886, I was walking with a large company\nwho were looking for berries. ... The day wore on, and very little was\naccomplished. At last I said: \u201cBrethren, you call this an unsuccessful\nexpedition. If this is the way you work, I do not wonder at your\nlack of success. Your success or failure depends upon the way you\ntake hold of the work. There are berries here; for I have found them.[294]\nSome of you have been searching the low bushes in vain; others\nhave found a few berries; but the high bushes have been passed by,\nsimply because you did not expect to find fruit on them. You see\nthat the fruit which I have gathered is large and ripe. In a little while\nother berries will ripen, and we can go over the bushes again. This\nis the way in which I was taught to gather fruit. If you had searched\nnear the wagon, you might have found fruit as well as I....\n\u201cThe Lord has placed these fruit-bearing bushes right in the\nmidst of these thickly settled places, and He expects you to find\nthem. But you have been altogether too much engaged in eating, and\namusing yourselves. You did not come to the field with an earnest\ndetermination to find fruit....\n\u201cBy working in the right way, you will teach the younger workers\nthat such matters as eating and recreation are of minor importance. It\nhas been hard work to bring the wagon of supplies to the ground, but\nyou have thought more of the supplies than of the fruit you ought to\ncarry home as the result of your labors. You should be diligent, first\nto pick the berries nearest you, and then to search for those farther\naway; after that you can return and work near by again, and thus you\nwill be successful.\u201d\u2014Gospel Workers, 136-139 (1886).\nWrestle With God for Souls\u2014If we have the interest that John\nKnox had when he pleaded before God for Scotland, we shall have\nsuccess. He cried, \u201cGive me Scotland, Lord, or I die.\u201d And when we\ntake hold of the work and wrestle with God, saying, \u201cI must have\nGathering in the Interested 267\nsouls; I will never give up the struggle,\u201d we shall find that God will\nlook upon our efforts with favor.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1887.\nDo Not Force Results\u2014As an interest is about to close up, be [295]\ncareful not to ripen it off too suddenly, but keep the confidence of\nthe people if possible, that souls who are in the valley of decision\nmay find the true path, the way, and the life.\u2014Letter 7, 1885.\nMethods of Clinching Decisions\nChrist Spoke Directly to His Hearers \u2014Even the crowd that\nso often thronged His steps was not to Christ an indiscriminate mass\nof human beings. He spoke directly to every mind and appealed\nto every heart. He watched the faces of His hearers, marked the\nlighting up of the countenance, the quick, responsive glance, which\ntold that truth had reached the soul; and there vibrated in His heart\nthe answering chord of sympathetic joy.\u2014Education, 231 (1903).\nHe Watched the Changing Countenance \u2014Jesus watched\nwith deep earnestness the changing countenances of His hearers.\nThe faces that expressed interest and pleasure, gave Him great satis-\nfaction. As the arrows of truth pierced to the soul, breaking through\nthe barriers of selfishness, and working contrition, and finally grat-\nitude, the Saviour was made glad. When His eye swept over the\nthrong of listeners, and He recognized among them the faces He\nhad before seen, His countenance lighted up with joy. He saw in\nthem hopeful subjects for His kingdom. When the truth, plainly\nspoken, touched some cherished idol, He marked the change of\ncountenance, the cold, forbidding look, which told that the light was\nunwelcome. When He saw men refuse the message of peace, His\nheart was pierced to the very depths.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 254, 255\n(1898).\nPreaching for Decision \u2014Cultivate earnestness and positive-[296]\nness in addressing the people. Your subject matter may be excellent,\nand just what the people need, but you would do well to mingle a\npositiveness with persuasive entreaties....\nPresent the plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d with authority, and exalt\nthe wisdom of God in the written Word. Bring the people to a\ndecision; keep the voice of the Bible ever before them. Tell them\nyou speak that which you do know, and testify that which is truth,\nbecause God has spoken it. Let your preaching be short and right\nto the point, and then at the proper time call for a decision. Do not\npresent the truth in a formal manner, but let the heart be vitalized by\n268\nMethods of Clinching Decisions 269\nthe Spirit of God, and let your words be spoken with such certainty\nthat those who hear may know that the truth is a reality to you.\u2014\nLetter 8, 1895.\nDo Not Miss the Mark\u2014Do not encourage the presentation of\nScripture in any way to encourage vainglory in the one who shall\nopen the Word to others. The work for this time is to bring students\nand workers to the place where they will deal with subjects in a\nserious, solemn, plain manner, that there may be no time uselessly\nemployed in this great work. Do not miss the mark. Time is too\nshort to reveal all that might be opened up to view; eternity will be\nrequired to know the length and breadth, the depth and height of the\nScriptures. There are truths of more importance to some souls than\nothers. Skill is needed in educating in Scriptural lines.\u2014Manuscript\n153, 1898.\nContinual Advancement\u2014We must not think, \u201cWell, we have\nall the truth, we understand the main pillars of our faith, and we\nmay rest on this knowledge.\u201d The truth is an advancing truth, and [297]\nwe must walk in the increasing light.\nA brother asked, \u201cSister White, do you think we must under-\nstand the truth for ourselves? Why can we not take the truths that\nothers have gathered together, and believe them because they have\ninvestigated the subjects, and then we shall be free to go on without\nthe taxing of the powers of the mind in the investigation of all these\nsubjects? Do you not think that these men who have brought out the\ntruth in the past were inspired of God?\u201d\nI dare not say they were not led of God, for Christ leads into\nall truth; but when it comes to inspiration in the fullest sense of the\nword, I answer, No....\nWe must have living faith in our hearts, and reach out for larger\nknowledge and more advanced light.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMarch 25, 1890.\nMake a Charge Against the Enemy \u2014We are living in a per-\nilous time, and we need that grace that will make us valiant in fight,\nturning to flight the armies of the aliens. Dear brother, you need\nmore faith, more boldness and decision in your labors. You need\nmore push and less timidity.... Our warfare is aggressive. Your\nefforts are too tame; you need more force in your labor, else you will\nbe disappointed in its results. There are times when you must make\n270 Evangelism\na charge against the enemy. You must study methods and ways to\nreach the people. Go right to them and talk with them.... Let the\npeople understand that you have a message that means life, eternal\nlife to them if they accept it. If any subject should enthuse the soul\nit is the proclamation of the last message of mercy to a perishing\nworld. But if they reject this message it will be to them a savor of\ndeath unto death. Therefore there is need to work diligently, lest\nyour labors be in vain. O that you would realize this, and that you[298]\nwould urge the truth upon the conscience with the power of God.\nGive force to your words and make the truth appear essential to their\neducated minds.\u2014Letter 8, 1895.\nAggressiveness Necessary\u2014Caution is needed; but while some\nof the workers are guarded and make haste slowly, if there are not\nunited with them in the work those who see the necessity of being\naggressive, very much will be lost; opportunities will pass, and the\nopening providence of God will not be discerned.\nWhen persons who are under conviction are not brought to make\na decision at the earliest period possible, there is danger that the\nconviction will gradually wear away....\nFrequently, when a congregation is at the very point when the\nheart is prepared for the Sabbath question, it is delayed through fear\nof the consequences. This has been done, and the result has not\nbeen good. God has made us depositaries of sacred truth; we have a\nmessage, a saving message, which we are commanded to give to the\nworld, and which is pregnant with eternal results. To us as a people\nhas been committed light that must illuminate the world.\u2014Letter\n31, 1892.\nSpirit\u2019s Power for Victory\u2014Talk to souls in peril, and get them\nto behold Jesus upon the cross, dying to make it possible for Him\nto pardon. Talk to the sinner with your own heart overflowing with\nthe tender, pitying love of Christ. Let there be deep earnestness, but\nnot a harsh, loud note should be heard in the voice of one who is\ntrying to win the soul to look and live. First have your own soul\nconsecrated to God. As you look upon our Intercessor in heaven, let\nyour heart be broken. Then, softened and subdued, you can address[299]\nrepenting sinners as one who realizes the power of redeeming love.\nPray with these souls, by faith laying them at the foot of the cross;\ncarry their minds up with your mind, and fix the eye of faith where\nMethods of Clinching Decisions 271\nyou look, upon Jesus, the Sin Bearer. Get them to look away from\ntheir poor sinful selves to the Saviour, and the victory is won....\nThe inworking ministry of the Holy Spirit is our great need. The\nSpirit is all divine in its agency and demonstration. God wants you\nto have the gracious spiritual endowment; then you will work with\na power that you were never conscious of before.

You can go forth in faith,\nbelieving that the Holy Spirit accompanies you.\u2014Letter 77, 1895.\nThe Holy Spirit Impresses Truth \u2014It is the Holy Spirit that\nmakes the truth impressive. Keep practical truth ever before the\npeople.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:57 (1900).\nDecision Influenced by Our Words and Deportment\u2014When\nI saw this congregation yesterday, I thought, The decisions are to\ncome after this meeting and during the meeting. There will be some\nthat will take their position forever under the black banner of the\npowers of darkness; there are some that will take their position\nunder the blood-stained banner of Prince Immanuel. Our words,\nour deportment, how we present the truth, may balance minds for\nor against the truth; and we want in every discourse, whether it\nis doctrinal or not, we want that Jesus Christ should be presented\ndistinctly, as John declared, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world.\u201d\nEvery expression that you have ever been in the habit of making,\npeople and ministers, that is sharp or cutting, every practice of [300]\nthrusting upon the people the very strongest positions, that they are\nno more prepared to receive than a baby to receive strong meat, must\nbe put aside. There must be a leading along, Christ must be woven\ninto everything that is argumentative as the warp and the woof of\nthe garment. Christ, Christ, Christ is to be in it everywhere, and my\nheart feels the need of Christ, as I have, seems to me, never felt it\nmore sensibly.\nHere are an ignorant people; they do not know anything about\nthe truth; they have been educated by the ministers that this is so\nand that is so. When the Word of God is explained to the people,\nwhen it is presented in its purity, and they see what the Word of God\nsays, what are they going to do? There are very few that will take\ntheir position on that Word. But I tell you, be very careful how you\nhandle the Word, because that Word is to make the decisions with\n272 Evangelism\nthe people. Let the Word cut, and not your words. But when they\nmake their decision, what will it be?\u2014Manuscript 42, 1894.\nA Delayed Harvest\u2014The priests were convinced of the divine\npower of the Saviour.... Many hearts were moved that for a time\nmade no sign. During the Saviour\u2019s life, His mission seemed to call\nforth little response of love from the priests and teachers; but after\nHis ascension \u201ca great company of the priests were obedient to the\nfaith.\u201d\u2014The Desire of Ages, 266 (1898).\nLeave Listeners Approachable\u2014Why was it that Christ went\nout by the seaside, and into the mountains? He was to give the word\nof life to the people. They did not see it just that minute. A good\nmany do not see it now, to take their position, but these things are\ninfluencing their lives; and when the message goes with a loud voice,[301]\nthey will be ready for it. They will not hesitate long; they will come\nout and take their position.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nMeeting Prejudice and Opposition\n[See also pp. 445, 446, \u201cPrejudice Broken Down.\u201d]\nOpposition\u2014Those who introduce the leaven of truth amid the\nmass of false theories and doctrines may expect opposition. Satan\u2019s\nbatteries will be opened upon those who advocate the truth, and\nthe standard bearers must expect to meet many sneers, and much\nreviling that is hard to bear.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 14,\n1902.\nReformation Creates Opposition \u2014Jesus and His disciples\nwere surrounded with bigotry, pride, prejudice, unbelief, and hatred.\nMen were filled with false doctrines, and nothing but united, persis-\ntent endeavor could be attended with any measure of success; but\nthe great work of saving souls could not be laid aside because there\nwere difficulties to surmount. It was written of the Son of God that\nHe should \u201cnot fail nor be discouraged.\u201d\nThere is a great work before us. The work that engages the\ninterest and activity of heaven is committed to the church of Christ.\nJesus said: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to\nevery creature.\u201d The work for our time is attended with the same\ndifficulties that Jesus had to meet, and that the reformers of every\nage have had to overcome; and we must set our wills on the side\nof Christ, and move forward with firm confidence in God.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, March 13, 1888.\nPrejudice Rejects Light \u2014There is in the heart of man that [302]\nwhich is opposed to truth and righteousness.... Christ\u2019s miraculous\npower gave evidence that He was the Son of God. In the cities of\nJudah overwhelming evidence was given of the divinity and mission\nof Christ.... But prejudice is hard to deal with, even by Him who is\nLight and Truth, and the prejudice that filled the hearts of the Jews\nwould not allow them to accept the evidence given. With scorn they\nrejected the claims of Christ.\u2014Manuscript 104, 1898.\nHolding to the Affirmative the Best Way\u2014Often, as you seek\nto present the truth, opposition will be aroused; but if you seek to\n273\n274 Evangelism\nmeet the opposition with argument, you will only multiply it, and\nthis you cannot afford to do. Hold to the affirmative. Angels of God\nare watching you, and they understand how to impress those whose\nopposition you refuse to meet with arguments. Dwell not on the\nnegative points of questions that arise, but gather to your minds affir-\nmative truths, and fasten them there by much study, earnest prayer,\nand heart consecration. Keep your lamps trimmed and burning, and\nlet bright rays shine forth, that men, beholding your good works,\nmay be led to glorify your Father who is in heaven.\nIf Christ had not held to the affirmative in the wilderness of temp-\ntation, He would have lost all that He desired to gain. Christ\u2019s way is\nthe best way to meet our opponents. We strengthen their arguments\nwhen we repeat what they say. Keep always to the affirmative. It\nmay be that the very man who is opposing you will carry your words\nhome, and be converted to the sensible truth that has reached his\nunderstanding.\nI have often said to our brethren: Your opponents will make\nstatements about your work that are false. Do not repeat their state-[303]\nments, but hold to your assertions of the living truth; and angels of\nGod will open the way before you. We have a great work to carry\nforward, and we must carry it in a sensible way. Let us never get\nexcited, or allow evil feelings to arise. Christ did not do this, and He\nis our example in all things. For the work given us to do we need\nmuch more of heavenly, sanctified, humble wisdom, and much less\nof self. We need to lay hold firmly on divine power.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 9:147, 148 (1909).\nWhen Opposed\u2014Guard the Tongue \u2014When opposed, you\nwill be in danger of retaliating in a sharp debating manner, if you are\nnot constantly softened and subdued by the contemplation of Christ,\nand have a heart to pray, \u201cBe Thou my pattern.\u201d Looking unto Jesus\nconstantly, catching His spirit, you will be able to present the truth\nas it is in Jesus....\nLove must be the prevailing element in all our work. In the\nrepresentation of others who do not believe as we do, every speaker\nmust guard against making statements that will appear severe and\nlike judging. Present the truth, and let the truth, the Holy Spirit of\nGod, act as a reprover, as a judge; but let not your words bruise and\nwound the soul....\nMeeting Prejudice and Opposition 275\nLet not one rasping word be spoken. Let all sharp speeches that\nyou are disposed to make, be kept to your individual self. Be as true\nas steel to principle, wise as a serpent, but harmless as a dove. If\nyour words are not to hurt anyone, you will have to speak only the\nwords that you are sure will not be harsh and cold and severe.... Of\nall the people in the world, reformers should be the most unselfish,\nthe kindest, the most courteous, learning Christ\u2019s ways and words\nand works.\u2014Letter 11, 1894.\nThe Spirit of Controversy\u2014Do not cherish a spirit of contro- [304]\nversy. Little good is accomplished by denunciatory speeches. The\nsurest way to destroy false doctrine is to preach the truth. Keep to\nthe affirmative. Let the precious truths of the gospel kill the force of\nevil. Show a tender, pitiful spirit toward the erring. Come close to\nhearts.\u2014Letter 190, 1902.\nSarcasm Offensive\u2014When in your discourses, you denounce\nwith bitter sarcasm that which you wish to condemn, you some-\ntimes offend your hearers, and their ears are turned from hearing\nyou further. Carefully avoid any severity of speech that might give\noffense to those you desire to save from error; for it will be difficult\nto overcome the feelings of antagonism thus aroused....\nIf you will weed out the tares from your discourses, your influ-\nence for good will be increased.\u2014Letter 366, 1906.\nNot to Invite Persecution\u2014Let everyone bear in mind that we\nare in no case to invite persecution. We are not to use words that are\nharsh and cutting. Keep them out of every article written, drop them\nout of every address given. Let the Word of God do the cutting, the\nrebuking; let finite men hide and abide in Jesus Christ. Let the Spirit\nof Christ appear. Let all be guarded in their words, lest they place\nthose not of our faith in deadly opposition against us, and give Satan\nan opportunity to use the unadvised words to hedge up our way....\nWe all need more of the deep love of Jesus in the soul, and far\nless of the natural impetuosity. We are in danger of closing up our\nown path by arousing the determined spirit of opposition in men in\nauthority, before the people are really enlightened in regard to the\nmessage God would have us bear. God is not pleased when by our [305]\nown course of action we bar the way so that the truth is prevented\nfrom coming to the people.\u2014Manuscript 95, 1894.\n276 Evangelism\nOpposition Advertises Truth\u2014Satan is fruitful in bringing up\ndevices to evade the truth. But I call upon you to believe the words I\nspeak today. Truth of heavenly origin is confronting Satan\u2019s false-\nhoods, and this truth will prevail.... Opposition and resistance only\nserve to bring out truth in new, distinct lines. The more truth is\nspoken against, the brighter it will shine. Thus the precious ore is\npolished. Every word of slander spoken against it, every misrepre-\nsentation of its value, awakens attention, and is the means of leading\nto closer investigation as to what is saving truth. The truth becomes\nmore highly estimated. New beauty and greater value are revealed\nfrom every point of view.\u2014Manuscript 8a, 1888.\nTreat Opponents With Respect\u2014We must expect to meet un-\nbelief and opposition. The truth has always had to contend with\nthese elements. But though you should meet the bitterest opposition,\ndo not denounce your opponents. They may think, as did Paul, that\nthey are doing God service; and to such we must manifest patience,\nmeekness, and long-suffering....\nThe Lord wants His people to follow other methods than that of\ncondemning wrong, even though the condemnation is just. He wants\nus to do something more than to hurl at our adversaries charges that\nonly drive them farther from the truth. The work which Christ came\nto do in our world was not to erect barriers, and constantly thrust\nupon the people the fact that they were wrong. He who expects to\nenlighten a deceived people must come near to them and labor for\nthem in love. He must become a center of holy influence.\nIn the advocacy of truth the bitterest opponents should be treated[306]\nwith respect and deference. Some will not respond to our efforts, but\nwill make light of the gospel invitation. Others, even those whom\nwe suppose to have passed the boundary of God\u2019s mercy, will be\nwon to Christ. The very last work in the controversy may be the\nenlightenment of those who have not rejected light and evidence, but\nwho have been in midnight darkness, and have in ignorance worked\nagainst the truth. Therefore treat every man as honest. Speak no\nword, do no deed, that will confirm any in unbelief.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:120-122 (1900).\nHelp in Every Emergency\u2014Every teacher of the truth, every\nlaborer together with God, will pass through searching, trying hours,\nwhen faith and patience will be severely tested. You are to be\nMeeting Prejudice and Opposition 277\nprepared by the grace of Christ to go forward, although apparent\nimpossibilities obstruct the way. You have a present help in every\ntime of emergency. The Lord allows you to meet obstacles, that you\nmay seek unto Him who is your strength and sufficiency. Pray most\nearnestly for the wisdom that comes from God; He will open the\nway before you, and give you precious victories if you will walk\nhumbly before Him.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series A, No. 7, p. 18.\n(1874).\nBaptism and Church Membership\nBaptism Requisite in Conversion \u2014Repentance, faith, and\nbaptism are the requisite steps in conversion. Letter 174, 1909.\nClinching Decision for Baptism\u2014The souls under conviction\nof the truth need to be visited and labored for. Sinners need a special[307]\nwork done for them, that they may be converted and baptized.\u2014\nManuscript 17, 1908.\nThe Sign of Entrance to the Kingdom\u2014Christ has made bap-\ntism the sign of entrance to His spiritual kingdom. He has made\nthis a positive condition with which all must comply who wish to\nbe acknowledged as under the authority of the Father, the Son, and\nthe Holy Spirit. Before man can find a home in the church, before\npassing the threshold of God\u2019s spiritual kingdom, he is to receive the\nimpress of the divine name, \u201cThe Lord our righteousness.\u201d Jeremiah\n23:6.\nBaptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world. Those\nwho are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and\nthe Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare\npublicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan, and have\nbecome members of the royal family, children of the heavenly King.\nThey have obeyed the command, \u201cCome out from among them, and\nbe ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean thing.\u201d And to them\nis fulfilled the promise, \u201cI will receive you, and will be a Father\nunto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord\nAlmighty.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n6:91 (1900).\nThe Christian\u2019s Oath of Allegiance\u2014As Christians submit to\nthe solemn rite of baptism, He registers the vow that they make to be\ntrue to Him. This vow is their oath of allegiance. They are baptized\nin the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Thus\nthey are united with the three great powers of heaven. They pledge\nthemselves to renounce the world and to observe the laws of the\nkingdom of God. Henceforth they are to walk in newness of life. No\n278\nBaptism and Church Membership 279\nlonger are they to follow the traditions of men. No longer are they [308]\nto follow dishonest methods. They are to obey the statutes of the\nkingdom of heaven. They are to seek God\u2019s honor. If they will be\ntrue to their vow, they will be furnished with grace and power that\nwill enable them to fulfill all righteousness. \u201cAs many as received\nHim, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to\nthem that believe on His name.\u2014Letter 129, 1903.\nThorough Conversion to the Truth\u2014The preparation for bap-\ntism is a matter that needs to be carefully considered. The new con-\nverts to the truth should be faithfully instructed in the plain \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord.\u201d The Word of the Lord is to be read and explained to\nthem point by point.\nAll who enter upon the new life should understand, prior to\ntheir baptism, that the Lord requires the undivided affections.... The\npracticing of the truth is essential. The bearing of fruit testifies to the\ncharacter of the tree. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit. The\nline of demarcation will be plain and distinct between those who\nlove God and keep His commandments and those who love Him not\nand disregard His precepts. There is need of a thorough conversion\nto the truth.\u2014Manuscript 56, 1900.\nAccepted When Position Fully Understood\u2014The test of dis-\ncipleship is not brought to bear as closely as it should be upon those\nwho present themselves for baptism.... When they give evidence\nthat they fully understand their position, they are to be accepted.\u2014\nTestimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 128 (1897).\nThorough Preparation for Baptism\u2014There is need of a more\nthorough preparation on the part of candidates for baptism. They are\nin need of more faithful instruction than has usually been given them.\nThe principles of the Christian life should be made plain to those [309]\nwho have newly come to the truth. None can depend upon their\nprofession of faith as proof that they have a saving connection with\nChrist. We are not only to say, \u201cI believe,\u201d but to practice the truth.\nIt is by conformity to the will of God in our words, our deportment,\nour character, that we prove our connection with Him. Whenever\none renounces sin, which is the transgression of the law, his life will\nbe brought into conformity to the law, into perfect obedience. This is\nthe work of the Holy Spirit. The light of the Word carefully studied,\nthe voice of conscience, the strivings of the Spirit, produce in the\n280 Evangelism\nheart genuine love for Christ, who gave Himself a whole sacrifice\nto redeem the whole person, body, soul, and spirit. And love is\nmanifested in obedience.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:91, 92\n(1900).\nThe Baptizing of Children\u2014Parents whose children desire to\nbe baptized have a work to do, both in self-examination and in giving\nfaithful instruction to their children. Baptism is a most sacred and\nimportant ordinance, and there should be a thorough understanding\nas to its meaning. It means repentance for sin, and the entrance\nupon a new life in Christ Jesus. There should be no undue haste\nto receive the ordinance. Let both parents and children count the\ncost. In consenting to the baptism of their children, parents sacredly\npledge themselves to be faithful stewards over these children, to\nguide them in their character building. They pledge themselves to\nguard with special interest these lambs of the flock, that they may\nnot dishonor the faith they profess.\nReligious instruction should be given to children from their\nearliest years. It should be given, not in a condemnatory spirit,\nbut in a cheerful, happy spirit. Mothers need to be on the watch\nconstantly, lest temptation shall come to the children in such a form[310]\nas not to be recognized by them. The parents are to guard their\nchildren with wise, pleasant instruction. As the very best friends\nof these inexperienced ones, they should help them in the work of\novercoming, for it means everything to them to be victorious. They\nshould consider that their own dear children who are seeking to do\nright are younger members of the Lord\u2019s family, and they should\nfeel an intense interest in helping them to make straight paths in the\nKing\u2019s highway of obedience. With loving interest they should teach\nthem day by day what it means to be children of God and to yield\nthe will in obedience to Him. Teach them that obedience to God\ninvolves obedience to their parents. This must be a daily, hourly\nwork. Parents, watch, watch and pray, and make your children your\ncompanions.\nWhen the happiest period of their life has come, and they in their\nhearts love Jesus and wish to be baptized, then deal faithfully with\nthem. Before they receive the ordinance, ask them if it is to be their\nfirst purpose in life to work for God. Then tell them how to begin.\nIt is the first lessons that mean so much. In simplicity teach them\nBaptism and Church Membership 281\nhow to do their first service for God. Make the work as easy to be\nunderstood as possible. Explain what it means to give up self to the\nLord, to do just as His Word directs, under the counsel of Christian\nparents.\nAfter faithful labor, if you are satisfied that your children un-\nderstand the meaning of conversion and baptism, and are truly con-\nverted, let them be baptized. But, I repeat, first of all prepare your-\nselves to act as faithful shepherds in guiding their inexperienced feet\nin the narrow way of obedience. God must work in the parents that\nthey may give to their children a right example, in love, courtesy,\nand Christian humility, and in an entire giving up of self to Christ. [311]\nIf you consent to the baptism of your children and then leave them\nto do as they choose, feeling no special duty to keep their feet in\nthe straight path, you yourselves are responsible if they lose faith\nand courage and interest in the truth.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n6:93-95 (1900).\nPreparing Young People for Baptism\u2014Candidates who have\ngrown to manhood and womanhood should understand their duty\nbetter than do the younger ones; but the pastor of the church has a\nduty to do for these souls. Have they wrong habits and practices? It\nis the duty of the pastor to have special meetings with them. Give\nthem Bible readings, converse and pray with them, and plainly show\nthe claims of the Lord upon them. Read to them the teaching of the\nBible in regard to conversion. Show what is the fruit of conversion,\nthe evidence that they love God. Show that true conversion is a\nchange of heart, of thoughts and purposes. Evil habits are to be\ngiven up. The sins of evil-speaking, of jealousy, of disobedience,\nare to be put away. A warfare must be waged against every evil\ntrait of character. Then the believing one can understandingly take\nto himself the promise, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you.\u201d Matthew\n7:7.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:95 (1900).\nExamination of Candidates \u2014The test of discipleship is not\nbrought to bear as closely as it should be upon those who present\nthemselves for baptism. It should be understood whether they are\nsimply taking the name of Seventh-day Adventists, or whether they\nare taking their stand on the Lord\u2019s side, to come out from the\nworld and be separate, and touch not the unclean thing. Before\nbaptism, there should be a thorough inquiry as to the experience of\n282 Evangelism\nthe candidates. Let this inquiry be made, not in a cold and distant[312]\nway, but kindly, tenderly, pointing the new converts to the Lamb of\nGod that taketh away the sin of the world. Bring the requirements\nof the gospel to bear upon the candidates for baptism.\nOne of the points upon which those newly come to the faith will\nneed instruction is the subject of dress. Let the new converts be\nfaithfully dealt with. Are they vain in dress? Do they cherish pride\nof heart? The idolatry of dress is a moral disease. It must not be\ntaken over into the new life. In most cases, submission to the gospel\nrequirements will demand a decided change in the dress.\nThere should be no carelessness in dress. For Christ\u2019s sake,\nwhose witnesses we are, we should seek to make the best of our\nappearance. In the tabernacle service, God specified every detail\nconcerning the garments of those who ministered before Him. Thus\nwe are taught that He has a preference in regard to the dress of\nthose who serve Him. Very specific were the directions given in\nregard to Aaron\u2019s robes, for his dress was symbolic. So the dress\nof Christ\u2019s followers should be symbolic. In all things we are to be\nrepresentatives of Him. Our appearance in every respect should be\ncharacterized by neatness, modesty, and purity. But the Word of God\ngives no sanction to the making of changes in apparel merely for the\nsake of fashion,\u2014that we may appear like the world. Christians are\nnot to decorate the person with costly array or expensive ornaments.\nThe words of Scripture in regard to dress should be carefully\nconsidered. We need to understand that which the Lord of heaven\nappreciates in even the dressing of the body. All who are in earnest\nin seeking for the grace of Christ will heed the precious words of\ninstruction inspired by God. Even the style of the apparel will\nexpress the truth of the gospel.\nAll who study the life of Christ and practice His teachings will[313]\nbecome like Christ. Their influence will be like His. They will\nreveal soundness of character. As they walk in the humble path of\nobedience, doing the will of God, they exert an influence that tells\nfor the advancement of the cause of God and the healthful purity of\nHis work. In these thoroughly converted souls the world is to have a\nwitness to the sanctifying power of truth upon the human character.\nThe knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ, expressed in char-\nacter, is an exaltation above everything that is esteemed in earth or\nBaptism and Church Membership 283\nin heaven. It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens\nthe portals of the heavenly city. This knowledge it is God\u2019s purpose\nthat all who put on Christ by baptism shall possess. And it is the\nduty of God\u2019s servants to set before these souls the privilege of their\nhigh calling in Christ Jesus.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:95-97\n(1900).\nJudge by the Fruit of the Life\u2014There is one thing that we have\nno right to do, and that is to judge another man\u2019s heart or impugn\nhis motives. But when a person presents himself as a candidate for\nchurch membership, we are to examine the fruit of his life, and leave\nthe responsibility of his motive with himself. But great care should\nbe exercised in accepting members into the church; for Satan has his\nspecious devices through which he purposes to crowd false brethren\ninto the church, through whom he can work more successfully to\nweaken the cause of God.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 10,\n1893.\nAdministration of the Ordinance \u2014Whenever possible, let\nbaptism be administered in a clear lake or running stream. And\ngive to the occasion all the importance and solemnity that can be [314]\nbrought into it. At such a service angels of God are always present.\nThe one who administers the ordinance of baptism should seek to\nmake it an occasion of solemn, sacred influence upon all spectators.\nEvery ordinance of the church should be so conducted as to be\nuplifting in its influence. Nothing is to be made common or cheap,\nor placed on a level with common things. Our churches need to\nbe educated to greater respect and reverence for the sacred service\nof God. As ministers conduct the services connected with God\u2019s\nworship, so they are educating and training the people. Little acts\nthat educate and train and discipline the soul for eternity are of vast\nconsequence in the uplifting and sanctifying of the church.\nIn every church, baptismal robes should be provided for the\ncandidates. This should not be regarded as a needless outlay of\nmeans. It is one of the things required in obedience to the injunction,\n\u201cLet all things be done decently and in order.\u201d 1 Corinthians 14:40.\nIt is not well for one church to depend upon borrowing robes\nfrom another. Often when the robes are needed, they are not to be\nfound; some borrower has neglected to return them. Every church\nshould provide for its own necessities in this line. Let a fund be\n284 Evangelism\nraised for this purpose. If the whole church unite in this, it will not\nbe a heavy burden.\nThe robes should be made of substantial material, of some dark\ncolor that water will not injure, and they should be weighted at the\nbottom. Let them be neat, well-shaped garments, made after an\napproved pattern. There should be no attempt at ornamentation, no\nruffling or trimming. All display, whether of trimming or ornaments,\nis wholly out of place. When the candidates have a sense of the\nmeaning of the ordinance, they will have no desire for personal\nadornment. Yet there should be nothing shabby or unseemly, for this[315]\nis an offense to God. Everything connected with this holy ordinance\nshould reveal as perfect a preparation as possible.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 6:97, 98 (1900).\nAn Impressive Baptismal Service \u2014The efforts put forth in\nOakland have borne fruit in the salvation of precious souls. Sun-\nday morning, December 16, I attended a baptismal service at the\nPiedmont Baths. Thirty-two candidates were buried with their Lord\nin baptism, and arose to walk in newness of life. This was a scene\nthat angels of God witnessed with joy.... The entire service was\nimpressive. There was no confusion, and occasionally a verse of\nsome hymn of praise was sung.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1906.\nEmergency Baptism\u2014Arrangements will be made to fulfill the\naged man\u2019s request for baptism. He is not strong enough to go\nto _____ or to _____, and the only way in which the ceremony\ncan be performed is by getting a bathtub and letting him into the\nwater.\u2014Letter 126, 1901.\nGod\u2019s Keeping Power\u2014After the believing soul has received\nthe ordinance of baptism, he is to bear in mind that he is dedicated\nto God, to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit....\nAll who study the life of Christ and practice his teaching will\nbecome like Christ. Their influence will be like His. They will reveal\nsoundness of character. They are established in the faith, and will\nnot be overcome by the devil because of vanity and pride. They seek\nto walk the humble path of obedience, doing the will of God. Their\ncharacter exerts an influence that tells for the advancement of the\ncause of God and the healthful purity of His work....\nIn these thoroughly converted souls the world has a witness to[316]\nthe sanctifying power of truth upon the human character. Through\nBaptism and Church Membership 285\nthem Christ makes known to the world His character and will. In\nthe lives of God\u2019s children is revealed the blessedness of serving the\nLord, and the opposite is seen in those who do not keep His com-\nmandments. The line of demarcation is distinct. All who obey God\u2019s\ncommandments are kept by His mighty power amid the corrupting\ninfluence of the transgressors of His law. From the lowliest subject\nto the highest in positions of trust, they are kept by the power of God\nthrough faith unto salvation.\u2014Manuscript 56, 1900.\nDedicated to God\u2014Henceforth the believer is to bear in mind\nthat he is dedicated to God, to Christ, and to the Holy Spirit. He is\nto make all worldly considerations secondary to this new relation.\nPublicly he has declared that he will no longer live in pride and\nself-indulgence. He is no longer to live a careless, indifferent life.\nHe has made a covenant with God. He has died to the world. He\nis to live to the Lord, to use for Him all his entrusted capabilities,\nnever losing the realization that he bears God\u2019s signature, that he is\na subject of Christ\u2019s kingdom, a partaker of the divine nature. He is\nto surrender to God all that he is and all that he has, employing all\nhis gifts to His name\u2019s glory.\nThe obligations in the spiritual agreement entered into at baptism\nare mutual. As human beings act their part with whole-hearted\nobedience, they have a right to pray, \u201cLet it be known, Lord, that\nThou art God in Israel.\u201d The fact that you have been baptized in the\nname of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is an assurance\nthat if you will claim their help, these powers will help you in\nevery emergency. The Lord will hear and answer the prayers of His [317]\nsincere followers who wear Christ\u2019s yoke and learn in His school\nHis meekness and lowliness.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:98,\n99 (1900).\nThe Church\u2019s Responsibility for New Converts \u2014Faithful\nChristian men and women should have an intense interest to bring\nthe convicted soul to a correct knowledge of righteousness in Christ\nJesus. If any have allowed the desire for selfish indulgence to become\nsupreme in their life, the faithful believers should watch for these\nsouls as they that must give an account. They must not neglect the\nfaithful, tender, loving instruction so essential to the young converts\nthat there may be no halfhearted work. The very first experience\nshould be right.\n286 Evangelism\nSatan does not want anyone to see the necessity of an entire\nsurrender to God. When the soul fails to make this surrender, sin is\nnot forsaken; the appetites and passions are striving for the mastery;\ntemptations confuse the conscience, so that true conversion does not\ntake place. If all had a sense of the conflict which each soul must\nwage with satanic agencies that are seeking to ensnare, entice, and\ndeceive, there would be much more diligent labor for those who are\nyoung in the faith.\nThese souls, left to themselves, are often tempted, and do not\ndiscern the evil of the temptation. Let them feel that it is their\nprivilege to solicit counsel. Let them seek the society of those who\ncan help them. Through association with those who love and fear\nGod they will receive strength.\nOur conversation with these souls should be of a spiritual, en-\ncouraging character. The Lord marks the conflicts of every weak,\ndoubting, struggling one, and He will help all who call upon Him.\nThey will see heaven open before them, and angels of God descend-[318]\ning and ascending the ladder of shining brightness which they are\ntrying to climb.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:92, 93 (1900).\nChurch Membership\u2014Very close and sacred is the relation\nbetween Christ and His church,\u2014He the bridegroom, and the church\nthe bride; He the head, and the church the body. Connection with\nChrist, then, involves connection with His church.\u2014Education, 268\n(1903).\nSatan Discourages Joining the Church \u2014It is his [Satan\u2019s]\nstudied effort to lead professed Christians just as far from heaven\u2019s\narrangement as he can; therefore he deceives even the professed\npeople of God and makes them believe that order and discipline are\nenemies to spirituality; that the only safety for them is to let each\npursue his own course, and to remain especially distinct from bodies\nof Christians who are united and are laboring to establish discipline\nand harmony of action. All the efforts made to establish this are\nconsidered dangerous, a restriction of rightful liberty, and hence are\nfeared as popery. These deceived souls consider it a virtue to boast\nof their freedom to think and act independently. They will not take\nany man\u2019s say so. They are amenable to no man. It was and now\nis Satan\u2019s special work to lead men to feel that it is God\u2019s order to\nBaptism and Church Membership 287\nstrike out for themselves and choose their own order independent of\ntheir brethren.\u2014Letter 32, 1892.\nA Worthless Form Apart From Christ \u2014It is the grace of\nChrist that gives life to the soul. Apart from Christ, baptism, like\nany other service, is a worthless form. \u201cHe that believeth not the\nSon shall not see life.\u201d\u2014The Desire of Ages, 181 (1898).\nConversion, Not Just Baptism\u2014Salvation is not to be baptized, [319]\nnot to have our names upon the church books, not to preach the truth.\nBut it is a living union with Jesus Christ to be renewed in heart,\ndoing the works of Christ in faith and labor of love, in patience,\nmeekness, and hope. Every soul united to Christ will be a living\nmissionary to all around him.\u2014Letter 55, 1886.\nA Caution to Evangelists and Pastors \u2014Our ministering\nbrethren make a decided failure of doing their work in a manner\ndirected by the Lord. They fail to present every man perfect in Christ\nJesus. They have not gained an experience through personal com-\nmunion with God, or a true knowledge of what constitutes Christian\ncharacter; therefore many are baptized who have no fitness for this\nsacred ordinance, but who are knit to self and the world. They have\nnot seen Christ or received Him by faith.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nFebruary 4, 1890.\nA Weakness in Our Evangelism\u2014The accession of members\nwho have not been renewed in heart and reformed in life is a source\nof weakness to the church. This fact is often ignored. Some ministers\nand churches are so desirous of securing an increase of numbers\nthat they do not bear faithful testimony against unchristian habits\nand practices. Those who accept the truth are not taught that they\ncannot safely be worldlings in conduct while they are Christians in\nname. Heretofore they were Satan\u2019s subjects; henceforth they are to\nbe subjects of Christ. The life must testify to the change of leaders.\nPublic opinion favors a profession of Christianity. Little self-de-\nnial or self-sacrifice is required in order to put on a form of godliness,\nand to have one\u2019s name enrolled upon the church book. Hence many\njoin the church without first becoming united to Christ. In this Satan [320]\ntriumphs. Such converts are his most efficient agents. They serve\nas decoys to other souls. They are false lights, luring the unwary\nto perdition. It is in vain that men seek to make the Christian\u2019s\npath broad and pleasant for worldlings. God has not smoothed or\n288 Evangelism\nwidened the rugged, narrow way. If we would enter into life, we\nmust follow the same path which Jesus and His disciples trod,\u2014the\npath of humility, self-denial, and sacrifice.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 5:172 (1882).\nOur Goal\u2014Truly Converted Members\u2014Ministers who labor\nin towns and cities to present the truth should not feel content, nor\nthat their work is ended, until those who have accepted the theory\nof the truth realize indeed the effect of its sanctifying power, and\nare truly converted to God. God would be better pleased to have\nsix truly converted to the truth as the result of their labors, than to\nhave sixty make a nominal profession, and yet not be thoroughly\nconverted. These ministers should devote less time to preaching\nsermons, and reserve a portion of their strength to visit and pray\nwith those who are interested, giving them godly instruction, to the\nend that they may \u201cpresent every man perfect in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nThe love of God must be living in the heart of the teacher of the\ntruth. His own heart must be imbued with that deep and fervent love\nwhich Christ possessed; then it will flow out to others. Ministers\nshould teach that all who accept the truth should bring forth fruit to\nthe glory of God. They should teach that self-sacrifice must be prac-\nticed every day; that many things which have been cherished must be\nyielded; and that many duties, disagreeable though they may appear,\nmust be performed. Business interests, social endearments, ease,[321]\nhonor, reputation, in short, everything, must be held in subjection to\nthe superior and ever-paramount claims of Christ.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 4:317 (1879).\nBinding Off Thoroughly\nThe Evangelist Must Finish His Instruction \u2014A laborer\nshould never leave some portion of the work undone because it\nis not agreeable to perform, thinking that the minister coming next\nwill do it for him. When this is the case, if a second minister follows\nthe first, and presents the claims that God has upon His people,\nsome draw back, saying, \u201cThe minister who brought us the truth\ndid not mention these things.\u201d And they become offended because\nof the Word. Some refuse to accept the tithing system; they turn\naway, and no longer walk with those who believe and love the truth.\nWhen other lines are opened before them, they answer, \u201cIt was not\nso taught us,\u201d and they hesitate to move forward. How much better\nit would have been if the first messenger of truth had faithfully and\nthoroughly educated these converts in regard to all essential matters,\neven if fewer had been added to the church under his labors.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 369, 370 (1915).\nA Work That Will Not Ravel Out\u2014Ministers should not feel\nthat their work is finished until those who have accepted the theory\nof the truth realize indeed the influence of its sanctifying power,\nand are truly converted. When the Word of God, as a sharp, two-\nedged sword, cuts its way to the heart and arouses the conscience,\nmany suppose that this is enough; but the work is only begun. Good\nimpressions have been made, but unless these impressions are deep-\nened by careful, prayerful effort, Satan will counteract them. Let not [322]\nthe laborers rest content with what has been done. The plowshare of\ntruth must go deeper, and this it will surely do if thorough efforts are\nmade to direct the thoughts and establish the convictions of those\nwho are studying the truth.\nToo often the work is left in an unfinished state, and in many such\ncases it amounts to nothing. Sometimes, after a company of people\nhas accepted the truth, the minister thinks that he must immediately\ngo to a new field; and sometimes, without proper investigation, he is\nauthorized to go. This is wrong; he should finish the work begun;\n289\n290 Evangelism\nfor in leaving it incomplete, more harm than good is done. No field\nis so unpromising as one that has been cultivated just enough to give\nthe weeds a more luxuriant growth. By this method of labor many\nsouls have been left to the buffeting of Satan and the opposition of\nmembers of other churches who have rejected the truth; and many\nare driven where they can never again be reached. A minister might\nbetter not engage in the work unless he can bind it off thoroughly....\nUnless those who receive the truth are thoroughly converted,\nunless there is a radical change in the life and character, unless the\nsoul is riveted to the eternal Rock, they will not endure the test of\ntrial. After the minister leaves and the novelty has worn off, the truth\nloses its power to charm, and they exert no holier influence than\nbefore.\nGod\u2019s work is not to be done in a bungling, slipshod manner.\nWhen a minister enters a field, he should work that field thoroughly.\nHe should not be satisfied with his success until he can, through\nearnest labor and the blessing of Heaven, present to the Lord converts\nwho have a true sense of their responsibility, and who will do their\nappointed work. If he has properly instructed those under his care,[323]\nwhen he leaves for other fields of labor the work will not ravel out;\nit will be bound off so firmly as to be secure.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n367-369 (1915).\nTo Do a Thorough Work\u2014There is danger that those who hold\nmeetings in our cities will be satisfied with doing a surface work.\nLet the ministers and the presidents of our conferences arouse to the\nimportance of doing a thorough work. Let them labor and plan with\nthe thought in mind that time is nearly ended, and that because of\nthis they must work with redoubled zeal and energy.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, January 11, 1912.\nWhile we should be ever ready to follow the opening providence\nof God, we should lay no larger plans, occupy no more ground in\nbranching out than there is help and means to bind off the work\nwell and keep up and increase the interest already started. While\nthere are larger plans and broader fields constantly opening for the\nlaborers, there must be broader ideas, and broader views in regard\nto the workers who are to labor to bring souls into the truth.\u2014Letter\n34, 1886.\nBinding Off Thoroughly 291\nLeave a Well-Bound Off Work\u2014Churches are raised up and\nleft to go down while new fields are being entered. Now these\nchurches are raised up in much cost in labor and in means, and then\nneglected and allowed to ravel out. This is the way matters are going\nnow....\nWhile duties are suffering to be done right in our path, we should\nnot reach out and long and sigh for work at a great distance.... God\nwould not want you to leave so much work that you have planned,\nand started the people in upon, to be neglected, to run down, and be\nharder to bring up than if it had never been started....\nI hope you will look at things candidly and not move impulsively [324]\nor from feeling. Our ministers must be educated and trained to do\ntheir work more thoroughly. They should bind off the work and\nnot leave it to ravel out. And they should look especially after the\ninterests they have created, and not go away and never have any\nspecial interest after leaving a church. A great deal of this has been\ndone.\u2014Letter 1, 1879.\nSoul Interests Hold Priority\u2014For years light has been given\nupon this point, showing the necessity of following up an interest\nthat has been raised, and in no case leaving it until all have decided\nthat lean toward the truth, and have experienced the conversion\nnecessary for baptism, and united with some church, or formed one\nthemselves.\nThere are no circumstances of sufficient importance to call a\nminister from an interest created by the presentation of truth. Even\nsickness and death are of less consequence than the salvation of souls\nfor whom Christ made so immense a sacrifice. Those who feel the\nimportance of the truth, and the value of souls for whom Christ died,\nwill not leave an interest among the people for any consideration.\nThey will say, Let the dead bury their dead. Home interests, lands\nand houses, should not have the least power to attract from the field\nof labor.\nIf ministers allow these temporal things to divert them from the\nwork, the only course for them to pursue is to leave all, possess no\nlands or temporal interests which will have an influence to draw\nthem from the solemn work of these last days. One soul is of more\nvalue than the entire world. How can men who profess to have\ngiven themselves to the sacred work of saving souls, allow their\n292 Evangelism\nsmall temporal possessions to engross their minds and hearts, and\nkeep them from the high calling they profess to have received from[325]\nGod?\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:540, 541 (1870).\nLoss in Leaving an Unfinished Work Illustrated \u2014What\ncourage have we\u2014what courage can we have\u2014to put forth efforts\nin different places that use up our strength and vitality to the very\nlast edge; and then go away and leave it to all ravel out, with nobody\nto look after it?\nNow I will just mention my experience. After I stepped on\nAmerican soil, after coming from Europe, I did not go into a house\nbut went into a hotel and took my dinner, and then went to _____.\nThere was the place of all others where plans should have been laid\nto keep somebody there to bind off the work. There were a wealthy\npeople, and deeply convicted. It was a wonderful interest we had\nthere. The people would come out to the meeting and sit and listen\nwith tears in their eyes; they were deeply impressed; but the matter\nwas left with no one to follow up the interest; but everything was\nallowed to go right back. These things are not pleasing to God.\nWe are either spreading over too much ground and proposing to do\ntoo much work, or else matters are not arranged as they ought to\nbe.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nCreating a Difficult Field for Others\u2014Ministers who are not\nmen of vital piety, who stir up an interest among the people but leave\nthe work in the rough, leave an exceedingly difficult field for others\nto enter and finish the work they failed to complete. These men will\nbe proved; and if they do not do their work more faithfully, they will,\nafter a still further test, be laid aside as cumberers of the ground,\nunfaithful watchmen.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:317 (1879).\nResult of Haphazard Work\u2014Bind off your work thoroughly.\nLeave no dropped stitches for someone else to pick up. Do not[326]\ndisappoint Christ. Determine that you will succeed, and in the\nstrength of Christ you may give full proof of your ministry....\nNothing is so discouraging to the advancement of present truth as\nthe haphazard work done by some of the ministers for the churches.\nFaithful labor is needed. The churches are ready to die, because\nthey are not strengthened in Christlikeness. The Lord is not pleased\nwith the loose way in which the churches are left because men\nare not faithful stewards of God\u2019s grace. They do not receive His\nBinding Off Thoroughly 293\ngrace, and therefore cannot impart it. The churches are weak and\nsickly because of the unfaithfulness of those who are supposed to\nlabor among them, whose duty it is to have an oversight over them,\nwatching for souls as they that must give an account.\u2014Manuscript\n8a, 1888.\nLength of Effort and Closing The Campaign\nLength of Effort Not to be Prescribed\u2014Bear in mind that no\nliving man can tell the precise work, or bound the work of a man who\nis in God\u2019s service. No one can prescribe the days, the weeks, that\none should remain in a certain locality before pushing on to another\nplace. Circumstances must shape the labors of the minister of God,\nand if he seeks God he will understand that his work embraces every\npart of the Lord\u2019s vineyard, both that which is nigh and that which\nis afar off. The laborer is not to confine his work to a specified\nmeasurement. He must have no circumscribed limits, but extend his\nlabors wherever necessity demands. God is his co-laborer; he should\nseek wisdom and counsel of Him at every step and not depend upon\nhuman counsel.\nThe work has been greatly hindered in many fields because the[327]\nlaborers ask counsel from those who are not working in the field\nand who see not and feel not the demand, and therefore cannot\nunderstand the situation as well as the one who is on the ground.\u2014\nLetter 8, 1895.\nStudy Circumstances Carefully \u2014When a minister is ap-\npointed to a certain work, he is not to consider that he must ask\nthe president of the conference how many days he shall labor in\na certain locality, but he must seek wisdom from One who has\nappointed him his work, One who promised to give wisdom and\nunerring judgment, who giveth liberally and upbraideth not. He\nmust carefully consider every part of the vineyard apportioned to\nhim, and discern by the grace given what he shall do and what he\nshall not do. Circumstances will arise, which, if carefully studied,\nwith humility and faith, seeking wisdom of God, will make you a\nwise and successful laborer.\u2014Letter 8, 1895.\nA Complete Work\u2014The work in _____ must be carried for-\nward so long as the interest continues there. Some suitable place\nmust be provided where meetings can be held.... The work in ___-\n__ must not be cut short. For years I have pleaded that an earnest\n294\nLength of Effort and Closing The Campaign 295\neffort be put forth in this city, and now that this is being done, let us\ngo straight forward in right lines.\u2014Letter 380, 1906.\nPaul\u2019s Longer Campaign at Corinth\u2014The Lord God of Israel\nis hungry for fruit. He calls upon His workers to branch out more\nthan they are doing. The apostle Paul went from place to place,\npreaching the truth to those in the darkness of error. He labored for\na year and six months at Corinth, and proved the divine character of\nhis mission by raising up a flourishing church, composed of Jews [328]\nand Gentiles. The Gentile converts were more numerous than the\nJewish converts, and many of them were truly converted\u2014brought\nfrom darkness into the light of the gospel.\u2014Letter 96, 1902.\nLonger City Efforts\u2014In efforts made in large cities one half of\nthe effort is lost because they close up the work too soon and go to a\nnew field.... The haste to close up an effort has frequently resulted\nin a great loss.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nDetermining the Success of Meetings\nGod the Judge of the Worker\u2019s Success\u2014God, and not man,\nis the judge of man\u2019s work, and He will apportion to each his just\nreward. It is not given to any human being to judge between the\ndifferent servants of God. The Lord alone is the judge and rewarder\nof every good work.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 11, 1900.\nIf One Soul Endures, the Work Is a Success \u2014In the night\nseason I was conversing with you. I had a message for you and\nwas presenting that message. You were cast down and feeling dis-\ncouraged. I said to you, The Lord has bidden me speak to Brother\nand Sister _____. I said you are considering your work as almost\na failure, but if one soul holds fast to truth and endures unto the\nend, your work cannot be pronounced a failure. If one mother has\nbeen turned from her disloyalty to obedience, you may rejoice. The\nmother who follows on to know the Lord will teach her children to\nfollow in her footsteps. The promise is to fathers, to mothers, and to\ntheir children....\nThe Lord will not judge you by the amount of success manifested[329]\nin your efforts. I was bidden to tell you that your faith must be kept\nrevived and firm, and constantly increasing. When you see that those\nwho have ears will not hear, and, that those who are intelligent will\nnot understand, after you have done your best, pass on to regions\nbeyond and leave the result with God. But let not your faith fail.\u2014\nLetter 8, 1895.\nBe Not Discouraged With Small Returns \u2014The work that is\ndone to the honor and glory of God will bear the seal of God. Christ\nwill endorse the work of those who will do their best. And as they\ncontinue to do their best, they will increase in knowledge, and the\ncharacter of their work will be improved.\u2014Letter 153, 1903.\nIn comparison to the number that reject the truth, those that\nreceive it will be very small, but one soul is of more value than\nworlds beside. We must not become discouraged, although our work\ndoes not seem to bring large returns.\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\n296\nDetermining the Success of Meetings 297\nUnited, Steady Effort for Good Results\u2014Individual, constant,\nunited efforts will bring the reward of success. Those who desire\nto do a great deal of good in our world must be willing to do it in\nGod\u2019s way by doing little things. He who wishes to reach the loftiest\nheights of achievement by doing something great and wonderful,\nwill fail of doing anything.\nSteady progress in a good work, the frequent repetition of one\nkind of faithful service, is of more value in God\u2019s sight than the\ndoing of one great work, and wins of His children a good report,\ngiving character to their efforts. Those who are true and faithful to\ntheir divinely appointed duties are not fitful but steadfast in purpose,\npressing their way through evil, as well as good reports. They are [330]\ninstant in season and out of season.\u2014Letter 122, 1902.\nRight Methods Produce a Soul Harvest\u2014When in our work\nfor God right methods are energetically followed, a harvest of souls\nwill be gathered.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 28, 1904.\nEvil of Idolizing the Minister\u2014The fact that a minister is ap-\nplauded and praised is no evidence that he has spoken under the\ninfluence of the Spirit. It is too frequently the case that young\nconverts, unless guarded, will set their affections more upon their\nminister than upon their Redeemer. They feel that they have been\ngreatly benefited by their minister\u2019s labors. They conceive that he\npossesses the most exalted gifts and graces, and that no other can\ndo as well as he; therefore they attach undue importance to the man\nand his labors. This is a confidence that disposes them to idolize\nthe man, and look to him more than to God, and in doing this they\ndo not please God nor grow in grace. They do great harm to the\nminister, especially if he is young, and developing into a promising\ngospel laborer....\nThe minister of Christ who is imbued with the Spirit and love of\nhis Master, will so labor that the character of God and of His dear\nSon may be made manifest in the fullest and clearest manner. He\nwill strive to have his hearers become intelligent in their conceptions\nof the character of God, that His glory may be acknowledged on the\nearth.\u2014Gospel Workers, 44, 45 (1892).\nConverted to Man Rather Than Christ\u2014Four years ago there\nwas an effort made by Elder _____ in _____, and the people turned\nout in a wonderful manner to hear. If right plans had been made there\n298 Evangelism\nmight have been many souls brought to truth. Brother _____ was not[331]\nworking in the right lines, his main purpose was to get the largest\nkind of congregation by fanciful preaching, which differed vastly\nfrom the preaching of John, the forerunner of Christ. Many signed\nthe covenant, but when he left it was demonstrated that they believed\nin _____, were attracted to the man and not to Jesus Christ. Many\nwho signed the covenant were unconverted, and when left alone they\nwithdrew their names.\u2014Letter 79, 1893.\nElder _____\u2019s Church \u2014In working for those who are con-\nverted under your labors, you would be highly pleased if they were\ncalled Elder_____\u2019s church. You would like to manipulate their\nminds in such a way that they would be guided by sentiments of\nyour choosing. But God forbid! In fastening minds to yourself,\nyou lead them to disconnect from the Source of their wisdom and\nefficiency. Their dependence must not be in you but be wholly in\nGod. Only thus can they grow in grace. They are dependent on Him\nfor success, for usefulness, for power to be laborers together with\nGod.\u2014Letter 39, 1902.\nChrist\u2019s Property\u2014Not Ours \u2014Let us always remember,\nBrother _____, that no matter how great and good a work the human\nagent may do, he does not gain the ownership of those who through\nhis instrumentality have been converted to the truth. None are to\nplace themselves under the control of the minister who has been\ninstrumental in their conversion. In our ministry we are to bring\nsouls direct to Christ. They are Christ\u2019s property, and must ever be\namenable to Him alone. Every person possesses an individuality\nthat no other person can claim.\u2014Letter 193, 1903.\nGod to Receive the Glory for Success\u2014After the warning has\nbeen given, after the truth has been presented from the Scriptures,[332]\nmany souls will be convicted. Then great carefulness is needed. The\nhuman agent cannot do the work of the Holy Spirit, we are only\nthe channels through which the Lord works. Too often a spirit of\nself-sufficiency comes in, if a measure of success attends the efforts\nof the worker. But there must be no exaltation of self, nothing should\nbe attributed to self; the work is the Lord\u2019s, and His precious name\nis to receive all the glory. Let self be hid in Jesus.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, October 14, 1902.\nDetermining the Success of Meetings 299\nSuccess Fades With Self-praise\u2014Every man who praises him-\nself, brushes the luster from his best efforts.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 4:607 (1881).\nFull Credit to Associate Workers\u2014Each is to act his part faith-\nfully, and each is to give credit to his brother worker for the part\nwhich he performs. Let not your conversation be covetous, taking\ncredit to self. God has used many instrumentalities in His work.\nThat which you have done is only a part of that work. Others have\nworked diligently and prayerfully and intelligently and they must\nnot be overlooked. \u201cHis reward is with Him, and His work before\nHim.\u201d In the day of final reckoning God will justly reckon with His\nservants, and He will give to every man according as his works have\nbeen. God has marked the lives of the self-denying, self-sacrificing\nworkers who have carried the work in difficult fields.\nThese are things that you are to consider. The Lord is not pleased\nwith His servants when they take credit to themselves. In our old age\nlet us be just, and not appropriate to ourselves that which belongs\nto others. It has taken years to accomplish the work that has been\ndone, and one group after another of noble workers have acted their\npart in it.\u2014Letter 204, 1907.\nThe Lord Restricted by Our Attitude \u2014The Lord would do [333]\ngreat things for the workers, but their hearts are not humble. Should\nthe Lord work in them, they would become lifted up, filled with\nself-esteem, and would demerit their brethren.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, July 12, 1887.\nWhy Lack of Success \u2014In the pride of worldly wisdom and\nworldly ambition to be first, may be found the reason that the work\nof the gospel, notwithstanding its boundless resources, meets with\nso little success comparatively. Our Saviour rejoiced in spirit and of-\nfered thanks to God as He thought of how the value of truth, though\nhidden from the wise and prudent, is revealed to babes\u2014those\nwho realize their weakness and feel their dependence on Him.\u2014\nManuscript 118, 1902.\nReward of Soul Winning\u2014A rich reward will be given to the\ntrue workers, who put all there is of them into the work. There is no\ngreater bliss on this side of heaven than in winning souls to Christ.\nJoy fills the heart as the workers realize that this great miracle could\nnever have been wrought by human agencies, but only through the\n300 Evangelism\nOne who loves souls ready to perish. The divine presence is close\nbeside every true worker, making souls penitent. Thus the Christian\nbrotherhood is formed. The worker and those worked for are touched\nwith the love of Christ. Heart touches heart, and the blending of\nsoul with soul is like the heavenly intercourse between ministering\nangels.\u2014Manuscript 36, 1901.\nSection 10\u2014Establishing and Holding New [334]\nConverts\nFollow-up Methods\nThe Second Series of Meetings \u2014When the arguments for\npresent truth are presented for the first time, it is difficult to fasten\nthe points upon the mind. And although some may see sufficiently\nto decide, yet for all this, there is need of going all over the very\nsame ground again, and giving another course of lectures.\u2014Letter\n60, 1886.\nTo Fix the Truth Distinctly\u2014After the first efforts have been\nmade in a place by giving a course of lectures, there is really greater\nnecessity for a second course than for the first. The truth is new\nand startling, and the people need to have the same presented the\nsecond time, to get the points distinct and the ideas fixed in the\nmind.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\nImportance of Repeating Points of Truth\u2014If those who knew\nthe truth and were established in it were indeed in need of having\nits importance kept over before them and their minds stirred up by\nthe repetition of it, how important that this work is not neglected for\nthose newly come to the faith. Everything in the interpretation of the\nScripture is new and strange to them, and they will be in danger of\nlosing the force of the truth and receiving ideas not correct. In many[335]\nefforts that have been made the work has been left incomplete.\u2014\nLetter 60, 1886.\nCareful Plans for the Follow-up Series\u2014It may be advisable\nto change locations and have new congregations, but all the time you\nare making a second effort, do it just as perfectly as if the first effort\nhad not been made. Let every talent of the workers be put out to the\nexchangers. Let everyone do his level best and act an energetic part\nin the work and service of God.\nThere are different kinds of work to be done. Souls are precious\nin the sight of God; educate them, teach them, as they embrace the\ntruth, how to bear responsibilities. He who sees the end from the\nbeginning, who can make the seeds sown wholly fruitful, will be\nwith you in your efforts.\u2014Letter 48, 1886.\n302\nFollow-up Methods 303\nAn Example of Thorough Follow-up Work\u2014Our meeting has\nended. From the very first day, October 21, up to the present time\n(November 10), the interest has not abated. At the first meeting the\nlarge tent was crowded, and a wall of people stood round the outside.\nI spoke six times on Sabbath, Sunday, and Wednesday afternoons\nto the crowd that assembled, and five times in various lines to our\npeople. We had the best of ministerial labor.... The word was spoken\nin no faltering, hesitating manner, but in the demonstration of the\nSpirit and with power. The interest was superior to anything we have\nseen in any camp meeting in this country. We feel very grateful to\nthe Lord for this opportunity of making known the light of present\ntruth. As in Christ\u2019s day, the people listen and are astonished and\ncaptivated. They say, \u201cWe never heard anything like this. Oh, how I\nwish I could have heard all these things before. I never knew such [336]\nthings were in the Bible. I see that the work before me is to search\nthe Scriptures as I have never done before.\u201d\nThe Word of God has indeed been like a sword, quick and pow-\nerful. The crowds of people listened interestedly for one and nearly\ntwo hours without showing any appearance of weariness. Oh, I\nam so glad, so thankful. I praise the Lord with heart and soul and\nvoice....\nSeveral workers are keeping up the interest in Stanmore. This\ninterest does not flag. The big tent has been taken down and sent\nto Melbourne. The forty-foot tent is being spliced in the center so\nthat it will seat as many as possible, and will be used here. A house\nhas been rented to accommodate the workers. A room has been\nprepared for me, and if I am able I shall probably go to Sydney this\nweek to join the workers. We must do all we possibly can to make\nthis effort a success. Elder Haskell writes cheeringly in regard to the\nwork there and the unflagging interest.\u2014Letter 27, 1897.\nBuilding on Interest Created\u2014The laborers who may come in\nafter an interest has been created, may be men who have even less\nability than those who have started the work; but if they are humble\nmen of God, they may present the truth in such a way as to arouse\nand impress the hearts of some who have hitherto been untouched.\nThe Lord reveals truth to different minds in different aspects, so that\nthrough one man\u2019s presentation some point of truth is made clearer\nthan through another man\u2019s presentation, and for this very reason\n304 Evangelism\nthe Lord does not permit one man alone the work of dealing with\nhuman minds....\nOne man may carry his part of the work as far as he can, and\nthen the Lord will send another of His workmen to do another part of[337]\nthe work that the first worker did not feel the necessity of doing, and\nyet it was essential that the work should be done. Therefore let no\nman feel that it is his duty to begin and carry forward a work entirely\nhimself. If it is possible for Him to have other gifts in other laborers\nto work for the conversion of souls, let him gladly co-operate with\nthem.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1894.\nNew Converts Thoroughly Instructed\u2014Our efforts are not to\ncease because public meetings have been discontinued for a time.\nSo long as there are interested ones, we must give them opportunity\nto learn the truth. And the new converts will need to be instructed\nby faithful teachers of God\u2019s Word, that they may increase in a\nknowledge and love of the truth, and may grow to the full stature of\nmen and women in Christ Jesus. They must now be surrounded by\nthe influences most favorable to spiritual growth.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, February 14, 1907.\nDevelop the Local Talent \u2014Do the work of an evangelist\u2014\nwater and cultivate the seed already sown. When a new church\nhas been raised up, it should not be left destitute of help. The\nminister should develop the talent in the church, that meetings may\nbe profitably kept up. Timothy was commanded to go from church\nto church, as one who should do this kind of work, and build up\nthe churches in the most holy faith. He was to do the work of an\nevangelist, and this is an even more important work than that of the\nministers. He was to preach the Word, but he was not to be settled\nover one church.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 28, 1897.\nVisit New Members Often\u2014The work should not be left pre-\nmaturely. See that all are intelligent in the truth, established in the\nfaith, and interested in every branch of the work, before leaving[338]\nthem for another field. And then, like the apostle Paul, visit them\noften to see how they do. Oh, the slack work that is done by many\nwho claim to be commissioned of God to preach His Word, makes\nangels weep.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:256 (1885).\nLine Upon Line, Precept Upon Precept \u2014It is not preaching\nalone that must be done. Far less preaching is needed. More time\nFollow-up Methods 305\nshould be devoted to patiently educating others, giving the hearers\nopportunity to express themselves. It is instruction that many need,\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and there a little.\nBut it is very difficult to impress the minds of our ministering\nbrethren with the idea that sermons alone cannot do the work that\nis needed for our churches. Personal efforts are wanted; they are\nessential for the prosperity of individuals and churches.\u2014Manuscript\n7, 1891.\nHelp in Beginning the New Life \u2014Wherever such an interest\nis awakened as that which is now shown in _____, men of the best\nability should be chosen to help in the effort. They should enter\nheartily into the work of visiting and holding Bible readings with\nthose newly come to the faith, and with those who are interested,\nendeavoring to establish them in the faith. The new believers are to\nbe carefully instructed, that they may have an intelligent knowledge\nof the various lines of work committed to the church of Christ. One\nor two men should not be left alone with the burden of such a work.\nMuch depends upon the work done by the members of the church\nin connection with and following the tent meetings that shall be held\nin our cities. During the meeting, many, convicted by the Spirit,\nmay be filled with a desire to begin the Christian life; but unless [339]\nthere is constant watchfulness on the part of the workers who remain\nto follow up the interest, the good impressions made on the minds\nof the people will become indistinct. The enemy, full of subtle\nreasoning, will take advantage of every failure on the part of God\u2019s\nworkers to watch for souls as they that must give an account.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, March 2, 1905.\nCreate a Bulwark Around New Believers\u2014Just after the de-\ncisions are made, the forces of the powers of darkness take these\nminds that have been convicted, and that have resisted the conviction\nof the Spirit of God. They have a superstition, and Satan works upon\nthose minds until there is an intensity of opposition to the truth and\neverybody that believes it, and they think they are in God\u2019s service,\nas Christ told us, \u201cWhosoever killeth you will think that he doeth\nGod service.\u201d\nNow we can see the intensity of their minds. Where is the\nintensity on the other side? Unite with the Spirit of the living God\nto present a bulwark around our people and around our youth, to\n306 Evangelism\neducate and train them. This must be met, and we must carry right\nthrough the truth of God at any cost. We understand something\nabout it, but there are many who do not understand anything about\nit, therefore we need to lead them along, to instruct them kindly and\ntenderly, and if the spirit of God is with us, we will know just what\nto say.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1894.\nComprehension of God\u2019s Over-all Purpose \u2014The student\nshould learn to view the Word as a whole, and to see the relation of\nits parts. He should gain a knowledge of its grand, central theme,\nof God\u2019s original purpose for the world, of the rise of the great\ncontroversy, and of the work of redemption. He should understand[340]\nthe nature of the two principles that are contending for supremacy,\nand should learn to trace their working through the records of his-\ntory and prophecy, to the great consummation. He should see how\nthis controversy enters into every phase of human experience; how\nin every act of life he himself reveals the one or the other of the\ntwo antagonistic motives; and how, whether he will or not, he is\neven now deciding upon which side of the controversy he will be\nfound.\u2014Education, 190 (1903).\nTeaching New Believers How to Meet Enemy\u2014It is poor pol-\nicy to leave a few here and there, unfed and uncared for, for devour-\ning wolves, or to become targets for the enemy to open fire upon. I\nhave been shown that there has been much of such work done among\nus as a people. Promising fields have been spoiled for future effort\nby striking in prematurely without counting the cost, and leaving the\nwork half done. Because there has been a course of lectures given,\nthen stop the work, rush into a new field to half do the work there,\nand these poor souls who have but a slight knowledge of the truth are\nleft without proper measures being taken to confirm and establish\nthem in the faith and educate them like well-drilled soldiers how to\nmeet the enemy\u2019s attacks and vanquish him.\u2014Letter 60, 1886.\nIntegrating New Believers into the Church\nTo Be Guided as Children\u2014\u201cAt the same time came the dis-\nciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of\nheaven? And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in\nthe midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be [341]\nconverted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the\nkingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as\nthis little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And\nwhoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me.\nBut whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me,\nit were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,\nand that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.\u201d\nBy \u201clittle ones\u201d Christ does not mean babies. Those to whom\nHe refers are \u201clittle ones which believe in Me\u201d\u2014those who have\nnot gained an experience in following Him, those who need to be\nled like children, as it were, in seeking the things of the kingdom of\nheaven.\u2014Manuscript 60, 1904.\nCounsel to Those New in the Faith\u2014I would address you who\nhave come to a knowledge of the truth in _____. You are young in\nthe faith, and there is great need of your walking humbly with God,\nand of learning daily in the school of Christ by dwelling particularly\nin meditation and conversation upon the lessons which He gave\nto His disciples. Walk in all humility of mind, distrustful of self,\nseeking wisdom from the God of wisdom, that all your ways and\nmethods may be in firm and close connection with the ways and the\nwill of God, that there may be no confusion....\nWe must never forget how hard it is to remove long-cherished\nerrors from the minds of men, which have been taught from child-\nhood. We must bear in mind that earth is not heaven, and that there\nwill be discouragements to meet and to overcome, but forbearance\nand tenderness and pity should be exercised toward all who are in\ndarkness. If we bring them to see the light, it will not be solely by [342]\narguments, it must be by the work of the grace of Christ on your\n307\n308 Evangelism\nown hearts, revealed in your own characters with firmness, yet with\nthe meekness and simplicity of Christ. Through much prayer you\nmust labor for souls, for this is the only method by which you can\nreach hearts. It is not your work, but the work of Christ who is by\nyour side, that impresses hearts....\nBe determined that you will not be at variance among yourselves,\nbut will have the peace of Christ in your own hearts, and then it will\nbe an easy work to have it brought into your own families. But\nwhen the garden of the heart is neglected, poisonous weeds of pride,\nself-esteem, self-sufficiency, obtain a rank growth. We individually\nmust watch unto prayer.\nThe characters we form will speak in the home life. If there is\nsweet accord in the home circle, the angels of God may minister in\nthe home. If there is wise management at home, kindness, meekness,\nforbearance, combined with firm principles, then be assured that\nthe husband is a house band; he binds the family together with holy\ncords and presents them to God, binding himself with them upon\nthe altar of God. What a light shines forth from such a family!\nThat family, properly conducted, is a favorable argument to the\ntruth, and the head of such a family will carry out the very same\nkind of work in the church as is revealed in the family. Wherever\nseverity, harshness, and want of affection and love are exhibited in\nthe sacred circle of the home, there will most assuredly be a failure\nin the plans and management in the church. Unity in the home,\nunity in the church, reveals Christ\u2019s manner and grace more than\nsermons and arguments.... Is the truth, the advanced truth we have\nreceived, producing in our own hearts the fruits of patience, faith,\nhope, charity, and thus leaving its saving influence upon human[343]\nminds, revealing that we are branches of the true Vine because we\nbear rich clusters of fruit?\u2014Letter 6b, 1890.\nTo Have Root in Themselves\u2014It is not in God\u2019s purpose that\nthe church shall be sustained by life drawn from the minister. They\nare to have root in themselves. The gospel news, the message\nof warnings, the third angel\u2019s message, is to be voiced by church\nmembers.\u2014Manuscript 83, 1897.\nEveryone who claims to be a Christian is to bear the responsibil-\nity of keeping himself in harmony with the guidance of the Word of\nGod. God holds each soul accountable for following, for himself,\nIntegrating New Believers into the Church 309\nthe pattern given in the life of Christ and for having a character that\nis cleansed and sanctified.\u2014Manuscript 63, 1907.\nNot to Put Ministers in Place of God\u2014While the new converts\nshould be taught to ask counsel from those more experienced in the\nwork, they should also be taught not to put the minister in the place\nof God. Ministers are but human beings, men compassed with\ninfirmities. Christ is the One to whom we are to look for guidance.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 7:20 (1904).\nPoints on Which to Establish the New Believers \u2014Ministers\nfrequently neglect these important branches of the work\u2014health re-\nform, spiritual gifts, systematic benevolence, and the great branches\nof the missionary work. Under their labors large numbers may em-\nbrace the theory of the truth, but in time it is found that there are\nmany who will not bear the proving of God....\nHow much better it would be for the cause, if the messenger of\ntruth had faithfully and thoroughly educated these converts in regard\nto all these essential matters, even if there were less whom he could\nnumber as being added to the church under his labors.\nMinisters must impress upon those for whom they labor the [344]\nimportance of their bearing burdens in connection with the work of\nGod. They should be instructed that every department of the work of\nGod should enlist their support and engage their interest. The great\nmissionary field is open to men, and the subject must be agitated,\nagitated, again and again. The people must understand that it is not\nthe hearers of the Word but the doers of the Word that will have\neternal life. Not one is exempted from this work of beneficence.\nGod requires of all men to whom He imparts the gifts of His grace\nto communicate, not only of their substance to meet the demands for\nthe time in successfully advancing His truth, but to give themselves\nto God without reserve....\nIt is not a trait of the natural heart to be beneficent; men must be\ntaught, giving them line upon line and precept upon precept, how to\nwork and how to give after God\u2019s order.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nDecember 12, 1878.\nDeveloping New Attitudes for God\u2019s Work \u2014How much\nmeans are spent for things that are mere idols, things that engross\nthe thoughts and affections, little ornaments that require attention\nto be kept free from dust and placed in order. The moments spent\n310 Evangelism\nin arranging these little idols might be spent in speaking a word\nin season to some soul, awakening an interest to inquire, \u201cWhat\nshall I do to be saved?\u201d These little things take the time that should\nbe devoted to prayer, seeking the Lord, and grasping by faith the\npromises....\nWhen I see how much might be done in such countries as I am\nnow in, my heart burns within me to show to those who profess to\nbe the children of God how much money they are wasting on dress,\non expensive furniture, or selfish pleasures, in excursions merely\nfor selfish gratifications. All this is embezzling the Lord\u2019s goods,[345]\nusing to please self that means that is wholly His and which should\nbe devoted to His service.\u2014Letter 42a, 1893.\nServiceable Christians \u2014The work of the ambassadors for\nChrist is far greater and more responsible than many dream of. They\nshould not be at all satisfied with their success until they can, by their\nearnest labors and the blessing of God, present to Him serviceable\nChristians, who have a true sense of their responsibility, and will do\ntheir appointed work. The proper labor and instruction will result in\nbringing into working order those men and women whose characters\nare strong, and their convictions so firm that nothing of a selfish\ncharacter is permitted to hinder them in their work, to lessen their\nfaith, or to deter them from duty.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n4:398, 399 (1880).\nPastoral Evangelism\nLooking After New Believers\u2014When men and women accept\nthe truth, we are not to go away and leave them and have no further\nburden for them. They are to be looked after. They are to be carried\nas a burden upon the soul, and we must watch over them as stewards\nwho must render an account. Then as you speak to the people, give\nto every man his portion of meat in due season, but you want to be in\nthat position where you can give this food.\u2014Manuscript 13, 1888.\nFeed My Lambs\u2014The Lord Jesus said to Peter, \u201cWhen thou\nart converted, strengthen thy brethren\u201d; and after His resurrection,\njust before His ascension, He said to His disciple, \u201cSimon, son of\nJonas, lovest thou Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, [346]\nLord; Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My\nlambs.\u201d\nThis was a work in which Peter had but little experience; but he\ncould not be complete in Christian life unless he learned to feed the\nlambs, those who are young in the faith. It would require great care,\nmuch patience and perseverance, to give those who are ignorant the\nsuitable teachings, opening up the Scriptures and educating them\nfor usefulness and duty. This is the work that must be done in the\nchurch at this day, or the advocates of truth will have a dwarfed\nexperience and will be exposed to temptation and deception. The\ncharge given to Peter should come home to nearly every minister.\nAgain and again the voice of Christ is heard repeating the charge to\nHis undershepherds, \u201cFeed My lambs,\u201d \u201cFeed My sheep.\u201d\nIn the words addressed to Peter the responsibilities of the gospel\nminister who has charge of the flock of God are laid before him.\u2014\nLetter 3, 1892.\nFeeding the Flock\u2014My brethren in the gospel ministry, let us\nfeed the flock of God. Let us bring encouragement and cheerfulness\nto every heart. Let us turn the eyes of our brethren and sisters away\nfrom the unlovely traits of character possessed by nearly everyone,\n311\n312 Evangelism\nand teach them to behold Christ, the One altogether lovely, the\nChiefest among ten thousand....\nGod has entrusted to mortals precious treasures of truth. These\ntreasures may be likened to beautiful fruit, which is to be presented\nto the people in vessels that are clean and pure and holy, so that they\nwill accept this fruit and enjoy it, to the glory of God.\u2014Manuscript\n127, 1902.\nVisit Every Family\u2014As the shepherd of the flock he [the min-\nister] should care for the sheep and the lambs, searching out the[347]\nlost and straying, and bringing them back to the fold. He should\nvisit every family, not merely as a guest to enjoy their hospitality,\nbut to inquire into the spiritual condition of every member of the\nhousehold. His own soul must be imbued with the love of God; then\nby kindly courtesy he may win his way to the hearts of all, and labor\nsuccessfully for parents and children, entreating, warning, encour-\naging, as the case demands.\u2014The Signs of the Times, January 28,\n1886.\nCome Close to Hearts\u2014Come close to your brethren; seek for\nthem, help them; come close to their hearts as one touched with the\nfeelings of their infirmities. Thus we may achieve victories that our\nsmall faith has not grasped. The members of these families should\nbe given some labor to perform for the good of souls. Mutual love\nand confidence will give them moral force to be laborers together\nwith God.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1898.\nThorns Must Be Uprooted and Cast Out\u2014Many who profess\nto be Christians are so engrossed with earthly cares that they have\nno time for the cultivation of piety. They do not regard true religion\nas of the first importance. A man may seem to receive the truth, but\nif he does not overcome his un-Christlike traits of character, these\nthorns grow and strengthen, killing the precious graces of the Spirit.\nThe thorns in the heart must be uprooted and cast out, for good and\nevil cannot grow in the heart at the same time. Unsanctified human\ninclinations and desires must be cut away from the life as hindrances\nto Christian growth.\u2014Letter 13, 1902.\nReprove and Exhort\u2014There is pastoral work to do, and this\nmeans to reprove and exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine;\nthat is, he should present the Word of God, to show wherein there[348]\nis a deficiency. If there is anything in the character of the professed\nPastoral Evangelism 313\nfollowers of Christ, the burden should certainly be felt by the minis-\nter, and not that he should lord it over God\u2019s heritage. To deal with\nhuman minds is the nicest job that was ever committed to mortal\nman.\u2014Manuscript 13, 1888.\nOften Make Sabbath Meeting a Bible Class \u2014It has often\nbeen presented to me that there should be less sermonizing by min-\nisters acting merely as local pastors of churches, and that greater\npersonal efforts should be put forth. Our people should not be made\nto think that they need to listen to a sermon every Sabbath. Many\nwho listen frequently to sermons, even though the truth be presented\nin clear lines, learn but little. Often it would be more profitable if the\nSabbath meetings were of the nature of a Bible class study. Bible\ntruth should be presented in such a simple, interesting manner that all\ncan easily understand and grasp the principles of salvation.\u2014Letter\n192, 1906.\nMore Than Sermons Needed\u2014A minister is one who minis-\nters. If you confine your work to sermonizing, the flock of God will\nsuffer; for they need personal effort. Let your discourses be short.\nLong sermons wear out both you and the people. If ministers would\nmake their sermons only half as long, they would do more good\nand would have strength left for personal work. Visit families, pray\nwith them, converse with them, search the Scriptures with them,\nand you will do them good. Give them evidence that you seek their\nprosperity, and want them to be healthy Christians.\u2014Manuscript 8a,\n1888.\nBearing the Censer of Fragrant Love \u2014The Lord\u2019s workers\nneed the melting love of Jesus in their hearts. Let every minister [349]\nlive as a man among men. Let him, in well-regulated methods, go\nfrom house to house, bearing ever the censer of heaven\u2019s fragrant\natmosphere of love. Anticipate the sorrows, the difficulties, the\ntroubles of others. Enter into the joys and cares of both high and\nlow, rich and poor.\u2014Letter 50, 1897.\nPreaching for Children\u2014At every suitable opportunity let the\nstory of Jesus\u2019 love be repeated to the children. In every sermon let a\nlittle corner be left for their benefit. The servant of Christ may make\nlasting friends of these little ones. Then let him lose no opportunity\nof helping them to become more intelligent in a knowledge of the\nScriptures. This will do more than we realize to bar the way against\n314 Evangelism\nSatan\u2019s devices. If children early become familiar with the truths of\nGod\u2019s Word, a barrier against ungodliness will be erected, and they\nwill be able to meet the foe with the words, \u201cIt is written.\u201d\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 208 (1915).\nDedicating Children\u2014Let the minister not forget to encourage\nthe precious lambs of the flock. Christ, the majesty of heaven, said,\n\u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for\nof such is the kingdom of God.\u201d Jesus does not send the children to\nthe rabbis; He does not send them to the Pharisees; for He knows\nthat these men would teach them to reject their best friend. The\nmothers that brought their children to Jesus, did well. Remember\nthe text, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them\nnot: for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d Let mothers now lead their\nchildren to Christ. Let ministers of the gospel take the little children\nin their arms, and bless them in the name of Jesus. Let words of\ntenderest love be spoken to the little ones; for Jesus took the lambs of[350]\nthe flock in His arms, and blessed them.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nMarch 24, 1896.\nSabbath Sermons for Visitors\u2014When learned men, statesmen,\nand so-called honorable men are present in a place of worship,\nthe minister thinks he must give them an intellectual treat; but in\nattempting to do this he loses a precious opportunity of teaching\nthe very lessons that were presented by the greatest Teacher the\nworld ever knew. All the congregations in our land need to learn\nmore of Christ and Him crucified. A religious experience that is\nnot founded in Christ and Him alone is worthless. These men of\nintellectual powers need a clear, Scriptural presentation of the plan\nof salvation. Let the truth, in its simplicity and power, be presented\nto them. If this does not hold the attention and arouse the interest,\nthey never can be interested in heavenly and divine things. In every\ncongregation there are souls who are unsatisfied. Every Sabbath\nthey want to hear something definite explaining how they can be\nsaved, how they are to become Christians. The important thing for\nthem to know is, How can a sinner be presented before God? Let\nthe way of salvation be presented before them in simplicity, just\nas plainly as you would speak to a little child. Lift up Jesus as the\nsinner\u2019s only hope.\u2014Manuscript 4, 1893.\nPastoral Evangelism 315\nNeglecting the Work for Reading and Study\u2014The duties of\na pastor are often shamelessly neglected because the minister lacks\nstrength to sacrifice his personal inclinations for seclusion and study.\nThe pastor should visit from house to house among his flock, teach-\ning, conversing, and praying with each family, and looking out for\nthe welfare of their souls. Those who have manifested a desire to\nbecome acquainted with the principles of our faith should not be\nneglected, but thoroughly instructed in the truth.\u2014Gospel Workers, [351]\n337 (1915).\nResponsibility of Spiritual Laymen to New Converts\nChurch Patiently to Help New Converts \u2014Those who have\nnewly come to the faith should be patiently and tenderly dealt with,\nand it is the duty of the older members of the church to devise ways\nand means to provide help and sympathy and instruction for those\nwho have conscientiously withdrawn from other churches for the\ntruth\u2019s sake, and thus cut themselves off from the pastoral labor to\nwhich they have been accustomed. The church has a special respon-\nsibility laid upon her to attend to these souls who have followed\nthe first rays of light they have received; and if the members of the\nchurch neglect this duty, they will be unfaithful to the trust that God\nhas given them.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 28, 1896.\nWatchful Attention and Encouragement\u2014After individuals\nhave been converted to the truth, they need to be looked after. The\nzeal of many ministers seems to fail as soon as a measure of success\nattends their efforts. They do not realize that these newly converted\nones need nursing,\u2014watchful attention, help, and encouragement.\nThese should not be left alone, a prey to Satan\u2019s most powerful\ntemptations; they need to be educated in regard to their duties, to be\nkindly dealt with, to be led along, and to be visited and prayed with.\nThese souls need the meat apportioned to every man in due season.\nNo wonder that some become discouraged, linger by the way,\nand are left for wolves to devour. Satan is upon the track of all. He\nsends his agents forth to gather back to his ranks the souls he has[352]\nlost. There should be more fathers and mothers to take these babes\nin the truth to their hearts, and to encourage them and pray for them,\nthat their faith be not confused.\nPreaching is a small part of the work to be done for the salvation\nof souls. God\u2019s Spirit convicts sinners of the truth, and He places\nthem in the arms of the church. The ministers may do their part,\nbut they can never perform the work that the church should do.\nGod requires His church to nurse those who are young in faith and\nexperience, to go to them, not for the purpose of gossiping with\n316\nResponsibility of Spiritual Laymen to New Converts 317\nthem, but to pray, to speak unto them words that are \u201clike apples of\ngold in pictures of silver.\u201d\nWe all need to study character and manner that we may know\nhow to deal judiciously with different minds, that we may use our\nbest endeavors to help them to a correct understanding of the Word\nof God, and to a true Christian life. We should read the Bible with\nthem, and draw their minds away from temporal things to their\neternal interests. It is the duty of God\u2019s children to be missionaries\nfor Him, to become acquainted with those who need help. If one is\nstaggering under temptation, his case should be taken up carefully\nand managed wisely; for his eternal interest is at stake, and the words\nand acts of those laboring for him may be a savor of life unto life, or\nof death unto death.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:68, 69 (1876).\nThe Guardianship Plan\u2014In Christ we are all members of one\nfamily. God is our Father, and He expects us to take an interest\nin the members of His household, not a casual interest, but a de-\ncided, continual interest. As branches of the parent vine, we derive\nnourishment from the same source, and by willing obedience, we [353]\nbecome one with Christ.\nIf one member of Christ\u2019s household falls into temptation, the\nother members are to look after him with kindly interest, seeking\nto arrest the feet that are straying into false paths, and win him to\na pure, holy life. This service God requires from every member of\nHis church.... The members of the Lord\u2019s family are to be wise and\nwatchful, doing all in their power to save their weaker brethren from\nSatan\u2019s concealed nets.\nThis is home missionary work, and it is as helpful to those who\ndo it as to those for whom it is done. The kindly interest we manifest\nin the home circle, the words of sympathy we speak to our brothers\nand sisters, fit us to work for the members of the Lord\u2019s household,\nwith whom, if we remain loyal to Christ, we shall live through eternal\nages. \u201cBe thou faithful unto death,\u201d Christ says, \u201cand I will give\nthee a crown of life.\u201d Then how carefully should the members of the\nLord\u2019s family guard their brethren and sisters! Make yourself their\nfriend. If they are poor and in need of food and clothing, minister to\ntheir temporal as well as their spiritual wants. Thus you will be a\ndouble blessing to them.\u2014Manuscript 63, 1898.\nHelping New Believers to Win Souls\nMinister to Educate New Believers in Soul Winning\u2014Place\nafter place is to be visited; church after church is to be raised up.\nThose who take their stand for the truth are to be organized into\nchurches, and then the minister is to pass on to other equally impor-\ntant fields.\nJust as soon as a church is organized, let the minister set the[354]\nmembers at work. They will need to be taught how to labor success-\nfully....\nThe power of the gospel is to come upon the companies raised\nup, fitting them for service. Some of the new converts will be so\nfilled with the power of God that they will at once enter the work.\nThey will labor so diligently that they will have neither time nor\ndisposition to weaken the hands of their brethren by unkind criticism.\nTheir one desire will be to carry the truth to the regions beyond.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 7:20 (1902).\nStress Personal Responsibility to God\u2014Personal responsibil-\nity, personal activity in seeking the salvation of others, must be the\neducation given to all newly come to the faith.... Personal faith is\nto be acted and practiced, personal holiness is to be cultivated, and\nthe meekness and lowliness of Christ is to become a part of our\npractical life. The work is to be thorough and deep in the heart of\nevery human agent.\nThose who profess to receive and believe the truth are to be\nshown the deadly influence of selfishness and its tainting, corrupting\npower. The Holy Spirit must work upon the human agent, else\nanother power will control mind and judgment. Spiritual knowledge\nof God and Jesus Christ whom He hath sent is the only hope of the\nsoul. Each soul is to be taught of God, line upon line, precept upon\nprecept; he must feel his individual accountability to God to engage\nin service for his Master, whose he is, and whom he is required to\nserve in the work of saving souls from death.\u2014Manuscript 25, 1899.\n318\nHelping New Believers to Win Souls 319\nBaptismal Vows\u2014Pledge to Win Souls\u2014God\u2019s people are to\nfeel a noble, generous sympathy for every line of work carried on\nin the great harvest field. By their baptismal vows they are pledged\nto make earnest, self-denying efforts to promote, in the hardest [355]\nparts of the field, the work of soulsaving. God has placed on every\nbeliever the responsibility of striving to rescue the helpless and the\noppressed.\u2014(Australasian) Union Conference Record, June 1, 1903.\nTruly Converted Will Work for Others\u2014Divine grace in the\nnewly converted soul is progressive. It gives an increase of grace,\nwhich is received, not to be hidden under a bushel, but to be imparted,\nthat others may be benefited. He who is truly converted will work\nto save others who are in darkness. One truly converted soul will\nreach out in faith to save another and still another. Those who do\nthis are God\u2019s agencies, His sons and daughters. They are a part of\nHis great firm, and their work is to help to repair the breach which\nSatan and his agencies have made in the law of God by trampling\nunderfoot the genuine Sabbath, and putting in its place a spurious\nrest day.\u2014Letter 29, 1900.\nWhy Some New Believers Do Not Advance \u2014Humble, sim-\nplehearted, trusting souls may do a work which will cause rejoicing\nin heaven among the angels of God. Their work at home, in their\nneighborhood, and in the church will be in its results as far-reaching\nas eternity. It is because this work is not done that the experience\nof young converts never reaches beyond the ABC in divine things.\nThey are always babes, always needing to be fed upon milk, and\nnever able to partake of true gospel meat.\u2014Letter 61, 1895.\nConfirmed in the Faith by Service\u2014When souls are converted,\nset them to work at once. And as they labor according to their ability,\nthey will grow stronger. It is by meeting opposing influences that we\nbecome confirmed in the faith. As the light shines into their hearts, [356]\nlet them diffuse its rays. Teach the newly converted that they are to\nenter into fellowship with Christ, to be His witnesses, and to make\nHim known unto the world.\nNone should be forward to enter into controversy, but they should\ntell the simple story of the love of Jesus. All should constantly search\nthe Scriptures for the reason of their faith, so that, if asked, they may\ngive \u201ca reason of the hope that is in them, with meekness and fear.\u201d\n320 Evangelism\nThe best medicine you can give the church is not preaching\nor sermonizing, but planning work for them. If set to work, the\ndespondent would soon forget their despondency, the weak would\nbecome strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all would be prepared to\npresent the truth as it is in Jesus. They would find an unfailing helper\nin Him who has promised to save all who come unto Him.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, June 25, 1895.\nRelation of Activity to Spirituality\u2014Those who are most ac-\ntively employed in doing with interested fidelity their work to win\nsouls to Jesus Christ, are the best developed in spirituality and devo-\ntion. Their very active working formed the means of their spirituality.\nThere is danger of religion losing in depth that which it gains in\nbreadth. This need not be, if, in the place of long sermons, there\nis wise education given to those newly come to the faith. Teach\nthem by giving them something to do, in some line of spiritual work,\nthat their first love will not die but increase in fervor. Let them feel\nthat they are not to be carried and to lean for support on the church;\nbut they are to have root in themselves. They can be in many lines,\naccording to their several abilities, useful in helping the church to\ncome nearer to God, and working in various ways to act upon the[357]\nelements outside the church which will be a means of acting bene-\nficially upon the church. The wisdom and prosperity of the church\ncasts a telling influence upon her favor. The psalmist prayed for the\nprosperity of the church, \u201cGod be merciful unto us, and bless us;\nand cause His face to shine upon us.... That Thy way may be known\nupon the earth, Thy saving health among all nations.\u201d\u2014Letter 44,\n1892.\nChristian Growth Will Be Evident\u2014Nothing saps spirituality\nfrom the soul more quickly than to enclose it in selfishness and self-\ncaring. Those who indulge self and neglect to care for the souls and\nbodies of those for whom Christ has given His life, are not eating of\nthe bread of life, nor drinking of the water of the well of salvation.\nThey are dry and sapless, like a tree that bears no fruit. They are\nspiritual dwarfs, who consume their means on self; but \u201cwhatsoever\na man soweth, that shall he also reap.\u201d\nChristian principles will always be made visible. In a thousand\nways the inward principles will be made manifest. Christ abiding in\nHelping New Believers to Win Souls 321\nthe soul is as a well that never runs dry.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJanuary 15, 1895.\nTo Keep the Church Alive by Service\u2014Let him seek to keep\nthe church alive by teaching its members how to labor with him for\nthe conversion of sinners. This is good generalship; and the result\nwill be found far better than if he should seek to perform the work\nalone.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 23, 1908.\nGuarding New Members Against Error And\nFanaticism\nSatan Annoys and Distracts New Believers\u2014Wherever there\nis a little company raised up, Satan is constantly trying to annoy and[358]\ndistract them. When one of the people turns away from his sins,\ndo you suppose that he will let him alone? No, indeed. We want\nyou to look well to the foundation of your hope. We want you to let\nyour life and your actions testify of you that you are the children of\nGod.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1885.\nNo Lack of Isms to Delude New Converts \u2014Satan is con-\nstantly seeking to lead men into error. He is the God of all dissension,\nand he has no lack of isms to bring forward to delude. New sects\nare constantly arising to lead from the truth; and instead of being\nfed with the bread of life, the people are served with a dish of fables.\nThe Scriptures are wrested and, taken from their true connection,\nare quoted to give falsehood the appearance of truth. The garments\nof truth are stolen to hide the features of heresy.\nPaul planted the pure truths of the gospel in Galatia. He preached\nthe doctrine of righteousness by faith, and his work was rewarded\nin seeing the Galatian church converted to the gospel. Then Satan\nbegan to work through false teachers to confuse the minds of some\nof the believers. The boasting of these teachers, and the setting forth\nof their wonder-working powers, blinded the spiritual eyesight of\nmany of the new converts, and they were led into error....\nFor a time Paul lost his hold on the minds of those who had\nbeen deceived; but relying on the word and power of God, and\nrefusing the interpretations of the apostate teachers, he was able\nto lead the converts to see that they had been deceived, and thus\ndefeat the purposes of Satan. The new converts came back to the\nfaith, prepared to take their position intelligently for the truth.\u2014\nManuscript 43, 1907.\nErroneous Doctrines by Professed Believers\u2014We shall all be[359]\nseverely tested. Persons who pretend to believe the truth will come\n322\nGuarding New Members Against Error And Fanaticism 323\nto us and urge upon us erroneous doctrines, which will unsettle our\nfaith in present truth if we pay heed to them. True religion alone will\nstand the test of the judgment.\u2014The Review and Herald, December\n2, 1884.\nSatan\u2019s Efforts to Divide God\u2019s People\u2014Christ foretold that\nthe going forth of deceivers would be accompanied with more danger\nto His disciples than would persecution.\nThis warning is repeated several times. Seducers, with their sci-\nentific problems, were to be guarded against more carefully than any\nother peril that they would meet; for the entrance of these seductive\nspirits meant the entrance of the specious errors that Satan has inge-\nniously prepared to dim the spiritual perceptions of those who have\nhad but little experience in the workings of the Holy Spirit, and of\nthose who remain satisfied with a very limited spiritual knowledge.\nThe effort of seducers has been to undermine confidence in the truth\nof God and to make it impossible to distinguish truth from error.\nWonderfully pleasing, fanciful, scientific problems are introduced\nand urged upon the attention of the unwary; and unless believers are\non their guard, the enemy, disguised as an angel of light, will lead\nthem into false paths....\nSatan can skillfully play the game of life with many souls, and\nhe acts in a most underhanded, deceptive manner to spoil the faith\nof the people of God and to discourage them.... He works today as\nhe worked in heaven, to divide the people of God in the very last\nstage of this earth\u2019s history. He seeks to create dissension, and to\narouse contention and discussion, and to remove if possible the old\nlandmarks of truth committed to God\u2019s people. He tries to make it [360]\nappear as if the Lord contradicts Himself.\nIt is when Satan appears as an angel of light that he takes souls\nin his snare, deceiving them. Men who pretend to have been taught\nof God, will adopt fallacious theories, and in their teaching will so\nadorn these fallacies as to bring in Satanic delusions. Thus Satan\nwill be introduced as an angel of light and will have opportunity to\npresent his pleasing fables.\nThese false prophets will have to be met. They will make an\neffort to deceive many, by leading them to accept false theories.\nMany scriptures will be misapplied in such a way that deceptive\ntheories will apparently be based upon the words that God has spo-\n324 Evangelism\nken. Precious truth will be appropriated to substantiate and establish\nerror. These false prophets, who claim to be taught of God, will take\nbeautiful scriptures that have been given to adorn the truth, and will\nuse them as a robe of righteousness to cover false and dangerous\ntheories. And even some of those who, in times past, the Lord has\nhonored, will depart so far from the truth as to advocate misleading\ntheories regarding many phases of truth, including the sanctuary\nquestion.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1906.\nThe Church to Be Sifted\u2014It is always difficult to hold fast the\nbeginning of our confidence firm unto the end, and the difficulty\nincreases when there are hidden influences constantly at work to\nbring in another spirit, a counterworking element, on Satan\u2019s side of\nthe question.\nIn the absence of the persecution there have drifted into our ranks\nmen who appear sound and their Christianity unquestionable, but\nwho, if persecution should arise, would go out from us. In the crisis\nthey would see force in specious reasons that have had an influence[361]\non their minds. Satan has prepared various snares to meet varied\nminds.\nWhen the law of God is made void, the church will be sifted by\nfiery trials, and a larger proportion than we now anticipate will give\nheed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils. Instead of being\nstrengthened when brought into strait places, many prove that they\nare not living branches of the true Vine, they bear no fruit, and the\nhusbandman taketh them away.\u2014Letter 3, 1890.\nTo Keep a Firm Hold on Bible Truth\u2014The Christian is to be\n\u201crooted and grounded\u201d in the truth, that he may stand firm against\nthe temptations of the enemy. He must have a continual renewal\nof strength, and he must hold firmly to Bible truth. Fables of every\nkind will be brought in to seduce the believer from his allegiance to\nGod, but he is to look up, believe in God, and stand firmly rooted\nand grounded in the truth.\nKeep a firm hold upon the Lord Jesus, and never let go. Have\nfirm convictions as to what you believe. Let the truths of God\u2019s\nWord lead you to devote heart, mind, soul, and strength to the doing\nof His will. Lay hold resolutely upon a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nLet your only argument be, \u201cIt is written.\u201d Thus we are to contend\nfor the faith once delivered to the saints. That faith has not lost any\nGuarding New Members Against Error And Fanaticism 325\nof its sacred, holy character, however objectionable its opposers may\nthink it to be.\nThose who follow their own mind and walk in their own way will\nform crooked characters. Vain doctrines and subtle sentiments will\nbe introduced with plausible presentations, to deceive, if possible,\nthe very elect. Are church members building upon the Rock? The\nstorm is coming, the storm that will try every man\u2019s faith, of what [362]\nsort it is. Believers must now be firmly rooted in Christ, or else\nthey will be led astray by some phase of error. Let your faith be\nsubstantiated by the Word of God. Grasp firmly the living testimony\nof truth. Have faith in Christ as a personal Saviour. He has been and\never will be our Rock of Ages. The testimony of the Spirit of God\nis true. Change not your faith for any phase of doctrine, however\npleasing it may appear, that will seduce the soul.\nThe fallacies of Satan are now being multiplied, and those who\nswerve from the path of truth will lose their bearings. Having nothing\nto which to anchor, they will drift from one delusion to another,\nblown about by the winds of strange doctrines. Satan has come\ndown with great power. Many will be deceived by his miracles....\nI entreat everyone to be clear and firm regarding the certain truths\nthat we have heard and received and advocated. The statements of\nGod\u2019s Word are plain. Plant your feet firmly on the platform of\neternal truth. Reject every phase of error, even though it be covered\nwith a semblance of reality.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 31,\n1905.\nDrifting Away From Bible Landmarks\u2014Many know so little\nabout their Bibles that they are unsettled in the faith. They remove\nthe old landmarks, and fallacies and winds of doctrine blow them\nhither and thither. Science, falsely so-called, is wearing away the\nfoundation of Christian principle; and those who once were in the\nfaith drift away from the Bible landmarks, and divorce themselves\nfrom God, while still claiming to be His children.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, December 29, 1896.\nNew Parties of Professed Believers \u2014The church needs to\nawake to an understanding of the subtle powers of satanic agen- [363]\ncies that must be met. If they will keep on the whole armor, they\nwill be able to conquer all the foes they meet, some of which are not\nyet developed.\n326 Evangelism\nConfederacies will increase in number and power as we draw\nnearer to the end of time. These confederacies will create opposing\ninfluences to the truth, forming new parties of professed believers\nwho will act out their own delusive theories. The apostasy will\nincrease. \u201cSome shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing\nspirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d Men and women have confederated\nto oppose the Lord God of heaven, and the church is only half awake\nto the situation. There needs to be much more prayer, much more of\nearnest effort, among professed believers.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nAugust 5, 1909.\nDanger in Ignorance of Our Past History\u2014All genuine expe-\nrience in religious doctrines will bear the impress of Jehovah. All\nshould see the necessity of understanding the truth for themselves\nindividually. We must understand the doctrines that have been stud-\nied out carefully and prayerfully. It has been revealed to me that\nthere is among our people a great lack of knowledge in regard to the\nrise and progress of the third angel\u2019s message. There is great need\nto search the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation, and learn\nthe texts thoroughly, that we may know what is written.\nThe light given me has been very forcible that many would go\nout from us, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.\nThe Lord desires that every soul who claims to believe the truth shall\nhave an intelligent knowledge of what is truth. False prophets will\narise and will deceive many. Everything is to be shaken that can be\nshaken. Then does it not become everyone to understand the reasons[364]\nfor our faith? In place of having so many sermons, there should be\na more close searching of the Word of God, opening the Scriptures\ntext by text, and searching for the strong evidences that sustain the\nfundamental doctrines that have brought us where we now are, upon\nthe platform of eternal truth.\nMy soul is made very sad to see how quickly some who have had\nlight and truth will accept the deceptions of Satan, and be charmed\nwith a spurious holiness. When men turn away from the landmarks\nthe Lord has established that we may understand our position as\nmarked out in prophecy, they are going they know not whither.\u2014\nManuscript 185, 1897.\nErrors Attractively Taught \u2014Spurious doctrines, spurious\npiety, spurious faith, much that is fair in appearance, abound all\nGuarding New Members Against Error And Fanaticism 327\naround us. Teachers will come clothed as angels of light; and if\npossible, they will deceive the very elect. The youth need to learn\nall they can of the truth if they would not be deceived by the tissue\nof falsehood that Satan will invent. They need to live in the sunlight\nof Christ\u2019s righteousness. They need to be rooted and grounded in\nthe truth, that they may impart to others the light they receive.\u2014The\nYouth\u2019s Instructor, April 22, 1897.\nDangers of Sensational Religion \u2014There is no safety, much\nless benefit, for our people in attending these popular holiness meet-\nings; let us rather search the Scriptures with much carefulness and\nearnest prayer, that we may understand the ground of our faith. Then\nwe shall not be tempted to mingle with those who, while making\nhigh claims, are in opposition to the law of God.\nWe must not have a sensational religion, which has no root in\ntruth. Solid instruction must be given to the people upon the reasons [365]\nof our faith. They must be educated to a far greater extent than\nthey have been in the doctrines of the Bible, and especially in the\npractical lessons that Jesus gave to His disciples. The believers\nmust be impressed with their great need of Bible knowledge. There\nmust be painstaking effort to fasten in the minds of all, the solid\narguments of the truth; for everyone will be tested, and those who\nare rooted and grounded in the work of God will be unmoved by the\nheresies that will arise on all sides; but if any neglect to obtain the\nnecessary preparation, they will be swept away by errors that have\nthe appearance of truth.\u2014Gospel Workers, 228, 229 (1892).\nConfusions of Babylon and Antichrist \u2014It is our individual\nduty to walk humbly with God. We are not to seek any strange,\nnew message. We are not to think that the chosen ones of God\nwho are trying to walk in the light, compose Babylon. The fallen\ndenominational churches are Babylon. Babylon has been fostering\npoisonous doctrines, the wine of error. This wine of error is made\nup of false doctrines, such as the natural immortality of the soul,\nthe eternal torment of the wicked, the denial of the pre-existence of\nChrist prior to His birth in Bethlehem, and advocating and exalting\nthe first day of the week above God\u2019s holy, sanctified day. These and\nkindred errors are presented to the world by the various churches....\nFallen angels upon earth form confederations with evil men. In\nthis age antichrist will appear as the true Christ, and then the law of\n328 Evangelism\nGod will be fully made void in the nations of our world. Rebellion\nagainst God\u2019s holy law will be fully ripe. But the true leader of all\nthis rebellion is Satan, clothed as an angel of light. Men will be\ndeceived and will exalt him to the place of God, and deify him.\u2014The[366]\nReview and Herald, September 12, 1893.\nBelievers to Continue Searching the Scriptures \u2014It is not\nenough to merely read, but the Word of God must enter into our\nhearts and our understanding, in order that we may be established in\nthe blessed truth. If we should neglect to search the Scriptures for\nourselves, that we may know what is truth, then if we are led astray,\nwe are accountable for it. We must search the Scriptures carefully,\nso that we will know every condition that the Lord has given us;\nand if we have minds of limited capacity, by diligently searching\nthe Word of God we may become mighty in the Scriptures, and may\nexplain them to others.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 3, 1888.\nOur Books Helpful in Establishing New Believers \u2014Many\nwill depart from the faith and give heed to seducing spirits. Pa-\ntriarchs and Prophets and Great Controversy are books that are\nespecially adapted to those who have newly come to the faith, that\nthey may be established in the truth. The dangers are pointed out that\nshould be avoided by the churches. Those who become thoroughly\nacquainted with the lessons in these books will see the dangers be-\nfore them, and will be able to discern the plain, straight path marked\nout for them. They will be kept from strange paths. They will make\nstraight paths for their feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.\nIn Desire of Ages, Patriarchs and Prophets, Great Controversy,\nand Daniel and the Revelation, there is precious instruction. These\nbooks must be regarded as of special importance, and every effort\nshould be made to get them before the people.\u2014Letter 229, 1903.\nGood Judgment in Dealing With New Members\u2014Hasty and\ninconsiderate actions result from a lack of judgment, and lead to[367]\nwrongdoing. But that which is most to be lamented is that the young\nconverts will be hurt by this influence, and their confidence in the\ncause of God shaken. Let us pray that when the time shall come to\nact we may be ready.\u2014Letter 16, 1907.\nReclaiming Backsliders\nGuard Against Apostasy\u2014Care should be exercised to educate\nthe young converts. They are not to be left to themselves, to be led\naway by false presentations, to walk in a false way. Let the watchmen\nbe constantly on guard, lest souls shall be beguiled by soft words\nand fair speech and sophistry. Teach faithfully all that Christ has\ncommanded. Everyone who receives Christ is to be trained to act\nsome part in the great work to be accomplished in our world.\u2014Letter\n279, 1905.\nCause for Backsliding by New Members\u2014Upon all new con-\nverts should be impressed the truth that abiding knowledge can be\ngained only by earnest labor and persevering study. As a rule, those\nwho are converted to the truth we preach have not previously been\ndiligent students of the Scriptures; for in the popular churches there\nis little real study of the Word of God. The people look to the min-\nisters to search the Scriptures for them and to explain what they\nteach.\nMany accept the truth without digging down deep to understand\nits foundation principles; and when it is opposed, they forget the\narguments and evidences that sustain it. They have been led to\nbelieve the truth, but have not been fully instructed as to what truth\nis, or carried forward from point to point in the knowledge of Christ.\nToo often their piety degenerates into a form, and when the appeals [368]\nthat first aroused them are no longer heard, they become spiritually\ndead.\u2014Gospel Workers, 368 (1915).\nDealing With Backsliders\u2014Those who are sent by God to do\na special work will be called to rebuke heresies and errors. They\nshould exercise Bible charity toward all men, presenting the truth as\nit is in Jesus. Some will be most earnest and zealous in their resis-\ntance to the truth; but while their faults must be exposed unflinch-\ningly and their evil practices condemned, long-suffering, patience,\nand forbearance must be exercised toward them. \u201cAnd of some have\n329\n330 Evangelism\ncompassion, making a difference: and others save with fear, pulling\nthem out of the fire; hating even the garments spotted by the flesh.\u201d\nThe church may be called upon to dismiss from their fellowship\nthose who will not be corrected. It is a painful duty that has to be\ndone. Sad indeed is such a step, and it should not be taken until every\nother means of correcting and saving the one in error has failed.\nChrist never made peace by anything like compromise. The\nhearts of God\u2019s servants will overflow with love and sympathy for\nthe erring, as represented by the parable of the lost sheep; but they\nwill have no soft words for sin. They show the truest friendship\nwho reprove error and sin without partiality and without hypocrisy.\nJesus lived in the midst of a sinful and perverse generation. He\ncould not be at peace with the world unless He left them unwarned,\nunreproved, and this would not be in accordance with the plan of\nsalvation.\u2014Letter 12, 1890.\nDealing With Wrongs in God\u2019s Way\u2014God is not pleased with\nthe slothful work done in the churches. He expects His stewards to\nbe true and faithful in giving reproof and correction. They are to[369]\nexpel wrong after the rule God has given in His Word, not according\nto their own ideas and impulses. No harsh means must be used, no\nunfair, hasty, impulsive work done. The efforts made to cleanse the\nchurch from moral uncleanness must be made in God\u2019s way. There\nmust be no partiality, no hypocrisy. There must be no favorites,\nwhose sins are regarded as less sinful than those of others. Oh, how\nmuch we all need the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Then we shall\nalways work with the mind of Christ, with kindness, compassion,\nand sympathy, showing love for the sinner while hating sin with a\nperfect hatred.\u2014Manuscript 8a, 1888.\nHow Paul Corrected Wrongs \u2014Contentions in the body of\nbelievers are not after the order of God. They result from the mani-\nfestation of the attributes of the natural heart. To all who bring in\ndisorder and disunion, the words of Paul are applicable: \u201cI, brethren,\ncould not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even\nas unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with\nmeat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are\nye able.\u201d Paul here addressed a people whose advancement was not\nproportionate to their privileges and opportunities. They ought to\nhave been able to bear the hearing of the plain Word of God, but\nReclaiming Backsliders 331\nthey were in the position in which the disciples were when Christ\nsaid to them, \u201cI have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot\nbear them now.\u201d They ought to have been far advanced in spiritual\nknowledge, able to comprehend and practice the higher truths of the\nWord; but they were unsanctified. They had forgotten that they must\nbe purged from their hereditary and cultivated tendencies to wrong,\nand that they must not cherish carnal attributes.\nIt was impossible for the apostle to reprove wrongdoing without [370]\nsome who claimed to believe the truth becoming offended. The\ninspired testimony could do these no good; for they had lost their\nspiritual discernment. Jealousy, evil surmising, and accusing closed\nthe door to the working of the Holy Spirit. Paul would gladly have\ndwelt upon higher and more difficult truths, truths which were rich in\nnourishment, but his instruction would have cut directly across their\ntendencies to jealousy, and would not have been received. The divine\nmysteries of godliness, which would have enabled them to grasp the\ntruths necessary for that time, could not be spoken. The apostle must\nselect lessons, which, like milk, could be taken without irritating\nthe digestive organs. Truths of the deepest interest could not be\nspoken, because the hearers would misapply and misappropriate\nthem, presenting them to young converts who needed only the more\nsimple truths of the Word....\nHoliness to God through Christ is required of Christians. If there\nare wrongs in the church, they should receive immediate attention.\nSome may have to be sharply rebuked. This is not doing the erring\none any wrong. The faithful physician of the soul cuts deep, that no\npestilent matter may be left to burst forth again. After the reproof\nhas been given, then comes repentance and confession, and God\nwill freely pardon and heal. He always pardons when confession is\nmade.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 11, 1900.\nTroublers of Zion\u2014There are in our churches those who pro-\nfess the truth who are only hindrances to the work of reform. They\nare clogs to the wheels of the car of salvation. This class are fre-\nquently in trial. Doubts, jealousies, and suspicion are the fruits of\nselfishness, and seem to be interwoven with their very natures. I [371]\nshall name this class chronic church grumblers. They do more harm\nin a church than two ministers can undo. They are a tax to the\nchurch and a great weight to the ministers of Christ. They live in an\n332 Evangelism\natmosphere of doubts, jealousies, and surmisings. Much time and\nlabor of the ambassadors of Christ are required to undo their work\nof evil, and restore harmony and union in the church. This takes\nfrom the courage and strength of God\u2019s servants and unfits them for\nthe work He has for them to do in saving perishing souls from ruin.\nGod will reward these troublers of Zion according to their works.\nThe ministers of Christ should take their position, and not be\nhindered in their work by these agents of Satan. There will be\nenough of these to question, and quibble, and criticize, to keep the\nministers of God constantly busy, if they will allow themselves to\nbe detained from the great work of giving the last saving message of\nwarning to the world. If the church has no strength to stand against\nthe unsanctified, rebellious feelings of church grumblers, it is better\nto let church and grumblers go overboard together than lose the\nopportunity of saving hundreds who would make better churches,\nand have the elements existing within themselves of strength and\nunion and power.\nThe very best way for ministers and churches is to let this fault-\nfinding, crooked class fall back into their own element, and pull away\nfrom the shore, launch out into the deep, and cast out the gospel net\nagain for fish that may pay for the labor bestowed upon them. Satan\nexults when men and women embrace the truth who are naturally\nfaultfinding and who will throw all the darkness and hindrance they\ncan against the advancement of the work of God. Ministers cannot\nnow in this important period of the work be detained to prop up men\nand women who see and have felt once the force of the truth. They[372]\nshould fasten believing Christians on Christ, who is able to hold\nthem up and preserve them blameless unto His appearing, while they\ngo forth to new fields of labor.\u2014The True Missionary, February,\n1874.\nRebaptism\nWhen the Former Baptism Does Not Satisfy \u2014There are\nmany at the present day who have unwittingly violated one of the\nprecepts of God\u2019s law. When the understanding is enlightened, and\nthe claims of the fourth commandment are urged upon the con-\nscience, they see themselves sinners in the sight of God. \u201cSin is the\ntransgression of the law\u201d and \u201che that shall offend on one point is\nguilty of all.\u201d\nThe honest seeker after truth will not plead ignorance of the law\nas an excuse for transgression. Light was within his reach. God\u2019s\nWord is plain, and Christ has bidden him search the Scriptures. He\nreveres God\u2019s law as holy, just, and good, and he repents of his\ntransgression. By faith he pleads the atoning blood of Christ, and\ngrasps the promise of pardon. His former baptism does not satisfy\nhim now. He has seen himself a sinner, condemned by the law of\nGod. He has experienced anew a death to sin, and he desires again\nto be buried with Christ by baptism, that he may rise to walk in\nnewness of life. Such a course is in harmony with the example of\nPaul in baptizing the Jewish converts. That incident was recorded\nby the Holy Spirit as an instructive lesson for the church.\u2014Sketches\nfrom the Life of Paul, 133 (1883).\nNot to Be Made a Testing Question for New Believers\u2014The\nsubject of rebaptism should be handled with the greatest care. After [373]\nthe truth is presented upon the Sabbath question and other important\npoints of our faith, and souls manifest the moral courage to take their\nposition upon the truth, they will see this question in the Bible light\nif they are fully converted. But by some these questions have been\nhandled unwisely, and God has sent reproof many times on this point.\nThose who place the subject of rebaptism in the front, making it of as\nmuch importance as the Sabbath question, are not leaving the right\nimpression upon the minds and correctly representing the subject.\nIt requires great discrimination to bring in kindred truths with the\n333\n334 Evangelism\nSabbath, rightly dividing the Word, giving to each his portion of\nmeat in due season.\nThose who lift the cross of the Sabbath have a tremendous battle\nto fight with self and with selfish interests which would interpose\nbetween their souls and God. Then when they have taken this\ngreat step and their feet have been planted upon the platform of\neternal truth, they must have time to become accustomed to their new\nposition, and not be hurried on the question of rebaptism. No one\nshould become a conscience for another or urge and press rebaptism.\nThis is a subject which each individual must conscientiously\ntake his position upon in the fear of God. This subject should be\ncarefully presented in the spirit of tenderness and love. Then the\nduty of urging belongs to no one but God; give God a chance to\nwork with His Holy Spirit upon the minds, so that the individual will\nbe perfectly convinced and satisfied in regard to this advanced step.\nA spirit of controversy and contention should never be allowed to\ncome in and prevail on this subject. Do not take the Lord\u2019s work out\nof His hands into your own hands. Those who have conscientiously\ntaken their position upon the commandments of God, will, if rightly[374]\ndealt with, accept all essential truth. But it needs wisdom to deal\nwith human minds. Some will be longer in seeing and understanding\nsome kindred truths than others, especially will this be the case in\nregard to the subject of rebaptism, but there is a divine hand that is\nleading them\u2014a divine spirit impressing their hearts, and they will\nknow what they ought to do and do it.\nLet none of our zealous brethren overdo this matter. They will\nbe in danger of getting before the Lord and making tests for others\nwhich the Lord has not bidden them to make. It is not the work\nof any of our teachers to urge rebaptism upon anyone. It is their\nbusiness to lay down the great principles of Bible truths, especially\nis this the case in regard to rebaptism. Then let God do the work of\nconvicting the mind and heart....\nEvery honest soul who accepts the Sabbath of the fourth com-\nmandment will see and understand his duty in time. But it will\ntake time for some. It is not a subject to be driven and forced upon\nthose newly come to the truth, but this subject will work like leaven;\nthe process will be slow and quiet, but it will do its work, if our\nRebaptism 335\nministering brethren will not be too fast and defeat the purpose of\nGod.\nThose who have long looked upon this subject see it quite clearly\nand think all others should see it just as they do. They do not consider\nthat with some newly come to the faith this matter looks like denying\nall their former religious experience. But in time they will come to\nregard the matter differently. As the truth is constantly unfolding to\ntheir minds, they will see advanced steps to be taken; new light will\nflash upon their pathway; God\u2019s Spirit will work upon their minds, if\nmen will not interfere and seek to drive them to the positions which\nthey think are truth.\nNow let it be distinctly understood, from time to time all through [375]\nour experience, God has given me testimonies of caution to our\nbrethren in regard to handling the subject of rebaptism. Our good\nBrother _____ and several others of our ministers I was shown were\nmaking a mistake at some point in their experience in putting in the\nfront and making a test question of rebaptism. This is not the way\nthat the subject should be treated. It is a matter to be treated as a\ngreat privilege and blessing, and all who are rebaptized, if they have\nthe right ideas upon this subject, will thus consider it. These good\nbrethren were not bringing those newly come to the faith along step\nby step, cautiously and guardedly, and the result was that some were\nturned from the truth, when a little time and tender, careful dealing\nwith them would have prevented all such sad results.\u2014Letter 56,\n1886.\nReconversion and Rebaptism of Seventh-day Adventists \u2014\nThe Lord calls for a decided reformation. And when a soul is truly\nreconverted, let him be rebaptized. Let him renew his covenant with\nGod, and God will renew His covenant with him.... Reconversion\nmust take place among the members, that as God\u2019s witnesses they\nmay testify to the authoritative power of the truth that sanctifies the\nsoul.\u2014Letter 63, 1903.\nProviding Church Buildings\nMemorials for the Truth\u2014When an interest is aroused in any\ntown or city, that interest should be followed up. The place should be\nthoroughly worked, until a humble house of worship stands as a sign,\na memorial of God\u2019s Sabbath, a light amid the moral darkness. These[376]\nmemorials are to stand in many places as witnesses to the truth. God\nin His mercy has provided that the messengers of the gospel shall\ngo to all countries, tongues, and peoples, until the standard of truth\nshall be established in all parts of the inhabited world.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:100 (1900).\nIt Assures a Stable Work\u2014Wherever a company of believers\nis raised up, a house of worship should be built. Let not the workers\nleave the place without accomplishing this.\nIn many places where the message has been preached and souls\nhave accepted it, they are in limited circumstances, and can do but\nlittle toward securing advantages that would give character to the\nwork. Often this renders it difficult to extend the work. As persons\nbecome interested in the truth, they are told by the ministers of other\nchurches,\u2014and these words are echoed by the church members,\u2014\n\u201cThese people have no church, and you have no place of worship.\nYou are a small company, poor and unlearned. In a short time the\nministers will go away, and then the interest will die down. Then\nyou will give up all these new ideas which you have received.\u201d\nCan we suppose that this will not bring strong temptation to\nthose who see the reasons of our faith and are convicted by the Spirit\nof God in regard to present truth? It has to be often repeated, that\nfrom a small beginning large interests may grow. If wisdom and\nsanctified judgment and skillful generalship are manifested by us\nin building up the interests of our Redeemer\u2019s kingdom, we shall\ndo all in our power to assure the people of the stability of our work.\nHumble sanctuaries will be erected where those who accept the truth\nmay find a place to worship God according to the dictates of their[377]\nown conscience.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:100, 101 (1900).\n336\nProviding Church Buildings 337\nSecuring City Properties\u2014In every city where the truth is pro-\nclaimed, churches are to be raised up. In some large cities there\nmust be churches in various parts of the city. In some places, meet-\ninghouses will be offered for sale at reasonable rates, which can be\npurchased advantageously.\u2014Letter 168, 1909.\nNo Less Humble Than Our Homes \u2014There have been times\nwhen it seemed necessary to worship God in very humble places;\nbut the Lord did not withhold His Spirit nor refuse His presence\nbecause of this. It was the best His people could do at the time, and\nif they worshiped Him in spirit and in truth, He never reproved or\ncondemned their efforts. But He has blessed us with means, and\nwe expend that means in making our houses attractive, in planning\nand executing to please, to honor, and to glorify ourselves; if we are\ncontent to thus leave the Lord out of our plans and to worship Him\nin a much poorer and more inconvenient place than we are willing\nto live in ourselves; if, I say, our selfish purposes are thus made\nsupreme and God and His worship secondary, He will not bestow\nupon us His blessing.\u2014Manuscript 23, 1886.\nPlain, Neat, and Perfect in Design \u2014We have no command\nfrom God to erect a building which will compare for richness and\nsplendor with the temple. But we are to build a humble house of\nworship, plain and simple, neat and perfect in its design.\nThen let those who have means look to it that they are as liberal\nand tasteful in erecting a temple wherein we may worship God as\nthey have been in locating and building and furnishing their own\nhouses. Let them manifest a willingness and a desire to show greater [378]\nhonor to God than to themselves. Let them build with nicety but\nnot with extravagance. Let the house be built conveniently and\nthoroughly so that when it is presented to God He can accept it and\nlet His Spirit rest upon the worshipers who have an eye single to\nHis glory. Nothing must interfere between God\u2019s glory and us; no\nselfish plans, no selfish schemes, no selfish purposes. There must be\nan agreement.\u2014Manuscript 23, 1886.\nSubstantial Buildings\u2014Some may ask, Why does Sister White\nalways use the words, \u201cplain, neat, and substantial,\u201d when speaking\nof buildings? It is because I wish our buildings to represent the\nperfection God requires from His people.\n338 Evangelism\n\u201cBut,\u201d some say, \u201cif the Lord is so soon to come, why do you\nurge our builders to put the best material into the buildings they\nerect?\u201d Would we dare to dedicate to God a house made of cheap\nmaterial, and put together so faultily as to be almost lifted from its\nfoundation when struck by a strong wind? We would be ashamed\nto put worthless material into a building for the Lord. And I would\nnot advise anyone to put worthless material into a house. It does\nnot pay. The floors of our houses should be made of well-seasoned\nwood. This will cost a little more, but will in the end save a great\ndeal of vexation. The frame of a building should be well matched\nand well put together. Christ is our example in all things. He worked\nat the carpenter\u2019s trade with His father Joseph, and every article He\nmade was well made, the different parts fitting exactly, the whole\nable to bear test.\nWhatever you do, let it be done as well as upright principles and\nyour strength and skill can do it. Let your work be like the pattern\nshown you in the mount. The buildings erected will soon be severely[379]\ntried.\u2014Manuscript 127, 1901.\nMembers to Help Build\u2014When a church is raised up, the mem-\nbers are to arise and build. Let the newly converted ones, under the\ndirection of a minister who is guided by the advice of his fellow\nministers, work with their own hands, saying, We need a church and\nwe must have a church and we will each do our best in helping in\nthe building....\nLet us reveal Christ by making advancement. God calls upon\nthose who claim to follow Jesus to make cheerful, united efforts\nin His cause. Let this be done and soon will be heard the voice of\nthanksgiving, \u201cSee what the Lord hath wrought.\u201d\u2014Letter 65, 1900.\nFinancial Help From the Outside \u2014We all need to be wide\nawake, that, as the way opens, we may advance the work in the large\ncities. We are far behind in following the instruction to enter these\ncities and erect memorials for God. Step by step we are to lead souls\ninto the full light of truth. We are to continue working until a church\nis organized, and a humble house of worship built. I am greatly\nencouraged to believe that many persons not of our faith will help\nconsiderably by their means. The light given me is that in many\nplaces, especially in the great cities of America, help will be given\nby such persons.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 30, 1902.\nProviding Church Buildings 339\nDifferent Styles of Architecture\u2014Churches are built in many\nplaces, but they need not all be built in precisely the same style.\nDifferent styles of building may be appropriate to different locations.\nIn the breastplate of the high priest there were many stones,\nbut each stone had its special light, adding to the beauty of the\nwhole. Every stone had its special significance, bearing its important\nmessage from God. There were many stones, but one breastplate. [380]\nSo there are many minds, but one Mind. In the church there are\nmany members, each having his peculiar characteristics, but they\nform one family.\u2014Letter 53, 1900.\nVentilation Given Consideration \u2014Sabbath afternoon the\nbeautiful and commodious meetinghouse in _____ was crowded\nto its utmost capacity. The day was warm, and abundant ventila-\ntion was needed. But the beautiful colored windows were not built\nto open. As a result, the congregation suffered intensely, and the\nspeaker was so poisoned that she experienced great suffering for\na week, and was barely able to fill one of her three appointments\nin New York City. Why will a people having abundance of infor-\nmation on health, sanitation, and ventilation, allow wrongly built\nmeetinghouses to stand year after year as closed reservoirs for poison\nair?\u2014W. C. White in The Review and Herald, November 25, 1909.\nProvide for the Church School \u2014Workers in new territory\nshould not feel free to leave their field of labor till the needed fa-\ncilities have been provided for the churches under their care. Not\nonly should a humble house of worship be erected, but all necessary\narrangements should be made for the permanent establishment of\nthe church school.\nThis matter has been plainly presented before me. I saw in\ndifferent places new companies of believers being raised up, and\nmeetinghouses being erected. Those newly come to the faith were\nhelping with willing hands, and those who had means were assisting\nwith their means. In the basement of the church, above ground, I\nwas shown a room provided for a school where the children could\nbe educated in the truths of God\u2019s Word. Consecrated teachers were\nselected to go to these places. The numbers in the school were not [381]\nlarge, but it was a happy beginning.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n6:108 (1900).\n340 Evangelism\nGo Forward\u2014When we open up the work in one field, and\ngather out a company, we consecrate them to God and then draw\nthem to unite with us in building a humble house of worship. Then\nwhen the church is finished, and dedicated to the Master, we pass\non to other fields. Distinct and plain the word has come to us, \u201cGo\nforward,\u201d and just as soon as the warning message has been given in\none place, and men and women raised up to continue the work there,\nwe pass to the unworked parts of the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\u2014Letter 154,\n1899.\nOn to New Fields\nChurch Members Taught to Stand Alone \u2014As I traveled\nthrough the South on my way to the conference, I saw city after city\nthat was unworked. What is the matter? The ministers are hovering\nover churches which know the truth while thousands are perishing\nout of Christ.\nIf the proper instruction were given, if the proper methods were\nfollowed, every church member would do his work as a member of\nthe body. He would do Christian missionary work. But the churches\nare dying, and they want a minister to preach to them.\nThey should be taught to bring a faithful tithe to God, that He\nmay strengthen and bless them. They should be brought into working\norder, that the breath of God may come to them. They should be\ntaught that unless they can stand alone, without a minister, they need\nto be converted anew, and baptized anew. They need to be born\nagain.\u2014Manuscript 150, 1901.\nGo Work for Souls\u2014Instead of keeping the ministers at work [382]\nfor the churches that already know the truth, let the members of the\nchurches say to these laborers: \u201cGo work for souls that are perishing\nin darkness. We ourselves will carry forward the services of the\nchurch. We will keep up the meetings, and, by abiding in Christ,\nwill maintain spiritual life. We will work for souls that are about us,\nand we will send our prayers and our gifts to sustain the laborers\nin more needy and destitute fields.\u201d\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n6:30 (1900).\nConference Workers Called to New Fields\u2014As a general rule,\nthe conference laborers should go out from the churches into new\nfields, using their God-given ability to a purpose in seeking and\nsaving the lost.\u2014Letter 136, 1902.\nAggressive Work Called For \u2014Our ministers should plan\nwisely, as faithful stewards. They should feel that it is not their\nduty to hover over the churches already raised up, but that they\nshould be doing aggressive evangelistic work, preaching the Word\n341\n342 Evangelism\nand doing house-to-house work in places that have not yet heard\nthe truth.... They will find that nothing is so encouraging as doing\nevangelistic work in new fields.\u2014Letter 169, 1904.\nIf the ministers would get out of the way, if they would go forth\ninto new fields, the members would be obliged to bear responsi-\nbilities, and their capabilities would increase by use.\u2014Letter 56,\n1901.\nMinisterial Forces Exhausted on Established Churches \u2014\nOur people have had great light, and yet much of our ministerial\nforce is exhausted on the churches, in teaching those who should\nbe teachers; enlightening those who should be \u201cthe light of the\nworld\u201d; watering those from whom should flow springs of living[383]\nwater; enriching those who might be veritable mines of precious\ntruth; repeating the gospel invitation to such as should be scattered\nto the uttermost parts of the earth, communicating the message of\nHeaven to many who have not had the privileges which they have\nenjoyed; feeding those who should be in the byways and highways\nheralding the invitation, \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d Come\nto the gospel feast; come to the supper of the Lamb; \u201cfor all things\nare now ready.\u201d\nNow is the time for earnest wrestling with God. Our voices\nshould join with the Saviour\u2019s in that wonderful prayer: \u201cThy king-\ndom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\u201d Let\nthe whole earth be filled with His glory. Many may ask, \u201cWho\nis sufficient for these things?\u201d The responsibility rests upon every\nindividual. \u201cNot that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything\nas of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God.\u201d\u2014The Review and\nHerald, July 23, 1895.\nSection 11\u2014The Work in the Large [384]\nAmerican Cities\nNew York\nThe Message to Go\u2014While in New York in the winter of 1901,\nI received light in regard to the work in that great city. Night after\nnight the course that our brethren should pursue passed before me.\nIn Greater New York the message is to go forth as a lamp that\nburneth. God will raise up laborers for this work, and His angels\nwill go before them. Though our large cities are fast reaching a\ncondition similar to the condition of the world before the Flood,\nthough they are as Sodom for wickedness, yet there are in them\nmany honest souls, who, as they listen to the startling truths of the\nadvent message, will feel the conviction of the Spirit. New York is\nready to be worked. In that great city the message of truth will be\ngiven with the power of God. The Lord calls for workmen. He calls\nupon those who have gained an experience in the cause to take up\nand carry forward in His fear the work to be done in New York and\nin other large cities of America. He calls also for means to be used\nin this work.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:54, 55 (1902).\nNew York\u2014A Symbol of Work in the World \u2014Those who\nbear the burden of the work in Greater New York should have the\nhelp of the best workers that can be secured. Here let a center for\nGod\u2019s work be made, and let all that is done be a symbol of the work[385]\nthe Lord desires to see done in the world....\nIn Greater New York, the Lord has many precious souls who\nhave not bowed the knee to Baal; and there are those who through\nignorance have walked in the ways of error. On these the light of\ntruth is to shine, that they may see Christ as the Way, the Truth, and\nthe Life.\nWe are to present the truth in the love of Christ. No extravagance\nor display should attend the work. It is to be done after Christ\u2019s\norder. It is to be carried forward in humility, in the simplicity of the\ngospel. Let not the workers be intimidated by outward appearances,\nhowever forbidding. Teach the Word, and the Lord by His Holy\n344\nNew York 345\nSpirit will send conviction to the hearers.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 7:38 (1902).\nWorking After God\u2019s Order\u2014Our manner of working must\nbe after God\u2019s order. The work that is done for God in our large\ncities must not be according to man\u2019s devising....\nIn our work we are to remember the way in which Christ worked.\nHe made the world. He made man. Then He came in person to the\nworld to show its inhabitants how to live sinless lives.\nBrother _____, the Lord has given you an opening in New York\nCity, and your mission work there is to be an example of what\nmission work in other cities should be. You are to show how the\nwork should be carried forward, sowing the seed, and then gathering\nthe harvest. There are those who can unite with you in your labor,\nengaging in the work understandingly, and in full sympathy with\nyou....\nYour work in New York has been started in right lines. You are to\nmake in New York a center for missionary effort, from which work\ncan be carried forward successfully. The Lord desires this center [386]\nto be a training school for workers, and nothing is to be allowed to\ninterrupt the work. After the people have embraced the truth and\ntaken their stand, then the Lord will prepare them to be educated\nfor the full reception of Bible truth. You must select as helpers men\nwho can carry the work forward solidly and thoroughly, laboring for\nthe conversion of the whole being, body, soul, and spirit. A solid\nfoundation, laid upon gospel plans, must be laid for the building up\nof the church.\u2014Letter 150, 1901.\nMedical Missionary and School Needs of the Great\nMetropolis\u2014We need a sanitarium and a school in the vicinity\nof New York City, and the longer the delay in the securing of these,\nthe more difficult it will become.\nIt would be well to secure a place as a home for our mission\nworkers outside the city. It is of great importance that they have\nthe advantages of pure water, free from all contamination. For this\nreason, it is often well to consider the advantages of locations among\nthe hills. And there should be some land, where fruit and vegetables\nmight be raised for the benefit of the workers. Let it be a mission in\nas healthful a place as possible, and let there be connected with it a\n346 Evangelism\nsmall sanitarium. A place in the city should also be secured where\nsimple treatments might be administered.\nSuch a home would be a welcome retreat for our workers, where\nthey may be away from the bustle and confusion of the city. The\nexercise called for in climbing hills is often a great benefit to our\nministers, physicians, or other workers who are in danger of failing\nto take sufficient exercise.\nLet such homes be secured in the neighborhood of several cities,[387]\nand earnest, determined efforts be put forth by capable men to give\nin these cities the warning message that is to go to all the world. We\nhave only touched, as it were, a few of the cities.\u2014Medical Ministry,\n308 (1909).\nThe Best Help\u2014To start medical missionary work in New York\nwill be the best thing that you can do. I have been shown that if\nin this work there could be men and women of experience, who\nwould give a correct representation of true medical missionary work,\nit would have great power in making a correct impression on the\npeople.\u2014Letter 195, 1901.\nCosmopolitan Medical Evangelism \u2014In New York there are\nmany who are ripe for the harvest. In this great city there are thou-\nsands who have not bowed the knee to Baal. The angel said, \u201cBehold,\nI bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.\u201d\nNew York contains a part of the \u201call people.\u201d We desire to see the\nnew year open with teachers at work in all parts of New York. There\nis a work to be done in this city.... In our large cities the medical\nmissionary work must go hand in hand with the gospel ministry. It\nwill open doors for the entrance of truth.\u2014Manuscript 117, 1901.\nStartling Notices Detrimental \u2014Some time ago Elder ____-\n_ got out some very startling notices regarding the destruction of\nNew York. I wrote immediately to the ones in charge of the work\nthere, saying that it was not wise to publish such notices, that thus\nan excitement might be aroused which would result in a fanatical\nmovement, hurting the cause of God. It is enough to present the truth\nof the Word of God to the people. Startling notices are detrimental\nto the progress of His work....\nI have sent cautions to the brethren working in New York, saying[388]\nthat these flaming, terrifying notices should not be published. When\nNew York 347\nmy brethren go to extremes, it reacts on me, and I have to bear the\nreproach of being called a false prophet.\nThink you that if I had said that New York would be destroyed\nby a tidal wave, I should have urged the purchase of property only\nsixty miles away from this city, as a sanitarium site, and a place from\nwhich New York could be worked?\u2014Letter 176, 1903.\nPlans to Reach Businessmen \u2014You should feel a decided re-\nsponsibility for the working of New York City. The men in the\nbusiness houses of New York and other large cities, as verily as the\nheathen in foreign lands, must be reached with the message.\u2014Letter\n168, 1909.\nHalls and Church Building Problems\u2014Go to New York City.\nLook the ground over carefully, and see whether it is advisable to\npurchase the hall and the land on which it stands. Perhaps the land\ncould be leased for a term of years. I have been instructed that some\nsuch methods will have to be followed in the work in the large cities.\nIf, after careful consideration, you decide that it is best to purchase\nthe hall, we shall do all in our power to raise the money. But it is\nbest to move understandingly. Pray, pray, pray, for if possible Satan\nwill close the doors which have opened for the entrance of truth.\nThe Lord desires a center for the truth to be established in the great,\nwicked city of New York....\nI ask you to investigate the work in New York, and lay plans\nfor establishing a memorial for God in this city. It is to be a center\nfor missionary effort, and in it a sanitarium is to be established....\nA determined effort must be made to unify our churches in New\nYork and the surrounding cities. This can be done, and it must [389]\nbe done if aggressive warfare in New York is successfully carried\nforward.\u2014Letter 154, 1901.\nResults to Follow Proper Effort\u2014God wants the work to go\nforward in New York. There ought to be thousands of Sabbathkeep-\ners in that place, and there would be if the work were carried on as\nit should be. But prejudices spring up. Men want the work to go in\ntheir lines, and they refuse to accept broader plans from others. Thus\nopportunities are lost. In New York there should be several small\ncompanies established, and workers should be sent out. It does not\nfollow that because a man is not ordained as a preacher he cannot\nwork for God. Let such ones as these be taught how to work, then\n348 Evangelism\nlet them go out to labor. On returning, let them tell what they have\ndone. Let them praise the Lord for His blessing, and then go out\nagain. Encourage them. A few words of encouragement will be an\ninspiration to them.\u2014Life Sketches, p. 385. (1915).\nBoston and New England\nUnworked Cities of New England \u2014My mind has been bur-\ndened in behalf of the large cities of the East. Besides New York\nCity, where you labored last summer, there is the important city\nof Boston, near which is situated the Melrose Sanitarium. And I\nknow of no place where there is a greater need for a rebuilding of\nthe first works than in Boston and in Portland, Maine, where the first\nmessages were given in power, but where now there is but a little\nhandful of our people.\u2014Letter 4, 1910.\nTo Be Worked Without Delay\u2014If in the city of Boston and\nother cities of the East, you and your wife will unite in medical [390]\nevangelistic work, your usefulness will increase, and there will open\nbefore you clear views of duty. In these cities the message of the first\nangel went with great power in 1842 and 1843, and now the time\nhas come when the message of the third angel is to be proclaimed\nextensively in the East. There is a grand work before our Eastern\nsanitariums. The message is to go with power as the work closes\nup. Portland, Maine, a city that has been foremost in temperance\nreform, is to be worked without delay.\u2014Letter 20, 1910.\nThere are towns in Maine, like Brunswick and Bangor, that must\nbe worked faithfully. All through the cities and towns of the East,\nthe truth is to shine forth as a lamp that burneth.\u2014Letter 28, 1910.\nImportance of the Near-by Sanitarium \u2014The buildings and\ngrounds at Melrose are of a character to recommend our medical\nmissionary work, which is to be carried forward not only in Boston,\nbut in many other unworked cities in New England. The Melrose\nproperty is such that conveniences can be provided that will draw to\nthat sanitarium persons not of our faith. The aristocratic as well as\nthe common people will visit that institution to avail themselves of\nthe advantages offered for restoration of health.\nBoston has been pointed out to me repeatedly as a place that\nmust be faithfully worked. The light must shine in the outskirts and\nin the inmost parts. The Melrose sanitarium is one of the greatest\n349\n350 Evangelism\nagencies that can be employed to reach Boston with the truth. The\ncity and its suburbs must hear the last message of mercy to be given\nto our world. Tent meetings must be held in many places. The\nworkers must put to the very best use the abilities God has given\nthem. The gifts of grace will increase by wise use. But there must[391]\nbe no self-exaltation. No precise lines are to be laid down. Let the\nHoly Spirit direct the workers. They are to keep looking unto Jesus,\nthe author and finisher of their faith. The work for this great city will\nbe signalized by the revelation of the Holy Spirit, if all will walk\nhumbly with God....\nWe hope that those in charge of the work in New England will co-\noperate with the Melrose sanitarium managers in taking aggressive\nsteps to do the work that should be done in Boston. A hundred\nworkers could be laboring to advantage in different portions of the\ncity, in varied lines of service....\nThe medical missionary work is a door through which the truth\nis to find entrance to many homes in the cities. In every city will\nbe found those who will appreciate the truths of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage....\nThe Lord will work with power, as we strive to do our part\nfaithfully. He will cause Boston to hear the message of present truth.\nCo-operate with Him in bringing this about, my brother, my sister,\nand He will help you, strengthen you, and encourage your hearts\nthrough the salvation of many precious souls.\u2014Special Testimonies,\nSeries B, No. 13, pp. 12-16. (1906).\nBoston\u2019s Thousands Craving for Simple Truths \u2014I feel a\ndeep anxiety that Boston shall hear the Word of the Lord and the rea-\nsons of our faith. Ask the Lord to raise up laborers to enter the field.\nAsk Him to raise up laborers who can gain access to the people of\nBoston. The message must be sounding forth. There are thousands\nin Boston craving for the simple truth as it is in Jesus. Cannot you\nwho minister in word and doctrine prepare the way for this truth to\nreach souls?\u2014Letter 25, 1905.\nIf We Move Out by Faith\u2014It was in the plan of God that the[392]\nMelrose sanitarium should come into the hands of our people, as a\nmeans of reaching the higher classes. The city of Boston and the\nsurrounding country should be thoroughly worked. I am instructed\nto say to Elder _____ and Elder _____ that they should connect with\nBoston and New England 351\nthem men and women who can help them sound the note of warning.\nWith the sanitarium should be connected the best help possible to\ngive a religious mold to the institution.\nLet Elder _____ secure the best help he can, and pitch a tent in\nthe vicinity of the city of Boston, and speak to the people as the\nLord gives utterance. There should be no delay in taking up this\nwork. Elder _____ might strengthen the effort by laboring for the\nJewish people. Physicians might help much by giving health talks\nin connection with the meetings....\nThe Lord is calling for a work to be done in the city of Boston. If\nyou will move out by faith in this work, God will greatly bless you.\nThere need be no great outward demonstration, but work quietly\nand earnestly. The Lord will help His humble, earnest workers.\nMake determined efforts. Say continually, \u201cI will not fail nor be\ndiscouraged.\u201d\u2014Letter 202, 1906.\nGod Will Lead in Establishing Institutions \u2014Do not worry,\nmy sister. The Lord is acquainted with your situation. Nothing\nescapes His notice. He will hear your prayers; for He is a prayer-\nhearing and a prayer-answering God. Put your trust in Him, and\nHe will certainly bring relief, in His own way. I am very thankful\nfor what I hear of the blessing that has attended the work in New\nBedford. Let us trust in God, and let our faith take hold of Him most\nearnestly.\nIf Brother _____ does not feel free to give his means to establish [393]\na sanitarium at this time, it is best not to urge him. The ideas that\nwe think are good may not always be the best. Let the Lord\u2019s way\nbe established.\nOh, how I long to see the work going with power in New Bedford\nand Fairhaven, and in many other places just as greatly in need of the\ntruth as these places. We hope that sometime a sanitarium may be\nestablished in New Bedford. Medical missionary workers are needed\nin such cities. But, dear sister, it requires talent of no ordinary ability\nto manage a sanitarium. Men of experience, tried and tested, must\ntake hold of the work. That part of the workers who undertake to\nestablish such an institution are experienced and qualified, is not\nsufficient. For their own sake, for the sake of the institution, and for\nthe sake of the cause at large, it is important that a complete corps\nof well-qualified men and women be found to enter upon the work.\n352 Evangelism\nThe Lord\u2019s eye is over the whole field, and when the time is ripe for\nan institution to be started in a certain field, He can turn toward that\nplace the minds of the men and women best prepared to enter the\ninstitution.\nThere are many lines of work to be carried forward. There is an\nopening for well-trained nurses to go among families, and awaken\nin households an interest in the truth. There is urgent need of many\nevangelists and Bible workers in such cities as Boston and New\nBedford. Such workers would find many opportunities to sow the\ngood seed. There is work for every energetic, thorough, earnest\nworker. The teaching of Christ, the simple truths taught by His\nparables, are just as much needed today as they were when He was\nin the world in person.\u2014Letter 29, 1905.\nRepeat the Message in the Eastern Cities \u2014What is being[394]\ndone in the Eastern cities where the advent message was first pro-\nclaimed? The cities of the West have had advantages, but who in\nthe East have been burdened to take up the work of going over the\nground that in the early days of the message was baptized with the\ntruth of the Lord\u2019s soon coming? The light has been given that the\ntruth should go again to the Eastern States where we first began our\nwork, and where we had our first experiences. We must make every\neffort to spread a knowledge of the truth to all who will hear, and\nthere are many who will listen. All through our large cities God has\nhonest souls who are interested in what is truth. There is earnest\nwork to be done in the Eastern States. Repeat the message, repeat\nthe message, were the words spoken to me over and over again. Tell\nMy people to repeat the message in the places where it was first\npreached, and where church after church took its position for the\ntruth, the power of God witnessing to the message in a remarkable\nmanner.\u2014Manuscript 29, 1909.\nCities of the East and South\nMessage to Reach the Cities and Suburbs \u2014There is New\nYork City, and the populous cities close by; there is Philadelphia and\nBaltimore and Washington. I need not enumerate all these places;\nyou know where they are. The Lord desires us to proclaim the third\nangel\u2019s message with power in these cities.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1909.\nPhiladelphia: Agitation Provides Evangelistic Opportuni-\nties\u2014Philadelphia and other important places should be worked.\nEvangelists should be finding their way into all the places where the\nminds of men are agitated over the question of Sunday legislation [395]\nand of the teaching of religion in the public schools. It is the neglect\nof Seventh-day Adventists to improve these providential opportuni-\nties to present the truth that burdens my heart and keeps me awake\nnight after night.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 20, 1905.\nAt the National Capital\u2014I have been writing much in regard\nto the need of making more decided efforts in Washington, D.C....\nWashington, the capital of the United States, is the very place from\nwhich this truth should shine forth.\u2014Letter 132, 1903.\nSensible, Rational Methods for Washington\u2014A strong evan-\ngelistic effort must be put forth in the capital of the nation.... I rejoice\nthat you have taken up this evangelistic work in Washington, and that\nso deep an interest has already been aroused. The accounts given\nregarding the work there correspond as nearly as possible to the\nrepresentation given me of what would be. I am sure, for the matter\nhas been presented to me, and this work must not be weakened by\nthe necessary laborers being called to other places....\nEvangelistic work must be done in Washington, and it must not\nbe broken into by calls from other places. God would have His work\nin the highways carried forward in straight lines.\nYou are where the Lord would have you. Elder _____ and your-\nself must not be loaded down with a great many burdens. Washington\nhas been neglected long enough. A decided work must now be done\nthere. The Lord will give strength and grace. The workers must not\n353\n354 Evangelism\nallow themselves to be diverted from the work by the many things\nthat will be sure to press for attention. This is the reason that I have\nfelt anxious that every talent of the workers in Washington shall be\nused in a way that will best advance His work.\nBrother _____ has mentioned several that he thought might be a[396]\nhelp to the work in Washington. But be cautious as to whom you\nemploy in the work there. Everything must be kept up to the Bible\nstandard....\nIn our work we are not to go onto a hilltop to shine. We are not\ntold that we must make a special, wonderful display. The truth must\nbe proclaimed in the highways and the byways, and thus work is\nto be done by sensible, rational methods. The life of every worker,\nif he is under the training of the Lord Jesus Christ, will reveal the\nexcellence of His life. The work that Christ did in our world is to be\nour example, as far as display is concerned. We are to keep as far\nfrom the theatrical and the extraordinary as Christ kept in His work.\nSensation is not religion, although religion will exert its own pure,\nsacred, uplifting, sanctifying influence, bringing spiritual life, and\nsalvation.\u2014Letter 53, 1904.\nEvangelistic Meetings for Washington Area \u2014There are\nplaces all around Washington in which missionary effort is needed.\nRight in Washington itself is a small world of unconverted souls,\nboth white and colored. Who is feeling the burden for them? And\nthere are many other important places yet unwarned. When I see\nthis neglect, I feel sore at heart. I am praying night and day that the\nburden may be rolled onto the men who are acting as leaders in the\nwork. Let those who are already at work, open the way for others\nwho desire to labor, and who are qualified to take part in missionary\neffort....\nThere are important cities needing labor, that are near by Wash-\nington\u2014our next-door neighbors, as it were. If our brethren and\nsisters will do earnest missionary work for all with whom they come\nin contact, new fields of labor right around us will be opened up.[397]\nThe burden to labor for souls will come to many of those settled\nhere, and they will desire to take an active part in the proclamation\nof the truth.\nWe plead that those settled in Takoma Park shall become laborers\ntogether with God in planting the standard of truth in unworked\nCities of the East and South 355\nterritories. Let a part of the large donations called for be used to\nfurnish workers in our cities close by Washington. Let faithful house-\nto-house work be done. Souls are perishing out of the ark of safety.\nLet the standard of truth be lifted up by the church members in their\nneighborhoods. Let ministers pitch their tent, and preach the truth to\nthe people with power, and then move to another vicinity and preach\nthe truth there.\u2014Letter 94a, 1909.\nProclaiming a Decided Message\u2014I call upon the believers in\nWashington to come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the\nLord against the mighty powers of darkness. Personal labor will be\nneeded in this city and its suburbs. Clear the King\u2019s highway. Lift\nup the standard higher and still higher. There is evangelistic work to\nbe done in Washington and Baltimore and in the many other large\ncities of the South and the East. Let the work of teaching and healing\nbe combined. Let ministers and medical missionaries put on the\nwhole armor of God and go forth to proclaim the gospel message. A\ndecided message is to be proclaimed in Washington. The trumpet is\nto be given a certain sound.\u2014Letter 304, 1908.\nNashville, St. Louis, New Orleans \u2014Every effort possible\nshould now be made to advance the work of God. Soon circum-\nstances will arise which will make it more difficult than it is now\nto present the truth to many who are at present within our reach.\nMost earnest efforts should be put forth in Washington, in Boston, [398]\nin Nashville, St. Louis, New Orleans, and in many other large cities.\nA comprehensive work will be accomplished when men and women\nstand in their places, faithfully doing their part. There is a call for\nhundreds of young men and women to be educated and trained for\nservice.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1908.\nNashville a Center\u2014Nashville has been presented to me as the\nmost favorable center from which to do a general work for all classes\nin the Southern States. In and near Nashville there are established\ninstitutions of learning which should be respected by our people.\nTheir influence has helped to make it possible for us to carry forward\nsuccessfully many lines of work from that center.\u2014Letter 262, 1903.\nMemphis and the Southern Cities\u2014The Lord gave me a mes-\nsage for Brother _____, instructing him to take up the work in\nMemphis.... He obeyed the word of the Lord, and he has reported\nexcellent success in his work in Memphis.\n356 Evangelism\nI am instructed to say to our people throughout the cities of the\nSouth, Let everything be done under the direction of the Lord. The\nwork is nearing its close. We are nearer the end than when we first\nbelieved.\u2014Letter 6, 1909.\nNew Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis\u2014There is a great work to\nbe done, and we have only a little while in which to do it. There are\ncities in the South\u2014New Orleans, Memphis, St. Louis\u2014in which\nbut little has been done, and there are others that have not been\nentered. In these places the standard of truth is to be uplifted. With\nmight and power we are to carry the truth to the people.\u2014Manuscript\n56, 1904.\nEvangelism for New Orleans and Southern Cities\u2014There is\na great work to be done, and we have only a little while in which[399]\nto do it. There are cities in the South\u2014New Orleans, Memphis, St.\nLouis\u2014in which but little has been done; and there are others that\nhave not been entered. In these places the standard of truth must be\nuplifted. With might and with power we are to carry the truth to the\npeople....\nNew Orleans is to be worked. At a proper time of the year a\npublic effort is to be made there. Camp meetings are to be held\nin many places, and evangelistic work is to be done after the camp\nmeeting is over. Thus the sheaves are to be gathered in.\nNow that the work in New Orleans is to be more fully entered\nupon, I am bidden to say, Let men and women who have a knowledge\nof the truth, and understand the way of the Lord, enter this city to\nwork with wisdom and in the fear of the Lord. The laborers who\nare chosen for the work in New Orleans should be those who have\nthe good of the cause at heart, men who will keep the glory of God\nalways in view, and who will make the strength of the God of Israel\ntheir front guard and their rearward. The Lord will certainly hear\nand answer the prayers of His workers if they will seek Him for\ncounsel and instruction.\nTo the workers who enter that field I would say, Exercise faith\nin God; and in your association with those not of our faith, let the\npractice of the truth appear in your lives. In presenting the doctrines\nof your faith, use the persuasive arguments of the Word of God, and\nlet your hearers see that it is your desire not to have controversy\nCities of the East and South 357\nwith them over their beliefs, but to present to them a \u201cThus saith the\nLord.\u201d \u201cIt is written,\u201d was Christ\u2019s forcible appeal on every occasion.\nPreach in your lives the practical godliness of the faith that you [400]\nbelieve. Let it be seen that the truth never degrades the receiver, mak-\ning him rough and coarse, or fretful and impatient. Make apparent\nto all your patience, your kindness, your long-suffering, gentleness,\ncompassion, and true goodness; for these graces are the expression\nof the character of the God whom you serve.\u2014Manuscript 49, 1907.\nWorkers for the Southland\u2014Let missionaries work quietly for\nboth white and colored people in the South. Let them work in a\nway to help those who most need help, who are surrounded with\ninfluences that are misleading. Many of them are under the control\nof those who will stir up the worst passions of the human heart.\nThe priests and rulers in Christ\u2019s day worked most successfully in\nstirring up the passions of the mob, because they were ignorant,\nand had placed their trust in man. Thus they were led to denounce\nand reject Christ and to choose a robber and murderer in His place.\nThe work in the South should be done without noise or parade. Let\nmissionaries who are truly converted, and who feel the burden of\nthe work, seek wisdom from God, and with all the tact they can\ncommand, let them go into this field. Medical missionaries can find\na field in which to relieve the distress of those who are falling under\nbodily ailments. They should have means so that they may clothe\nthe naked and feed the hungry. Christian help work will do more\nthan the preaching of sermons.... Let the workers be Christlike, that\nthey may by precept and example exert an elevating influence. Let\nthem furnish themselves with the most appropriate, simple lessons\nfrom the life of Christ to present to the people. Let them not dwell\ntoo much upon doctrinal points, or upon features of our faith that\nwill seem strange and new; but let them present the sufferings and [401]\nthe sacrifice of Christ; let them hold up His righteousness and reveal\nHis grace; let them manifest His purity and holiness of character.\nWorkers in the Southern field will need to teach the people line\nupon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, December 24, 1895.\nSouthern City Workers to Receive Encouragement \u2014The\nLord God has been at work. My brethren, instead of criticizing\nwhat has been done, save your speech for the great cities that have\n358 Evangelism\nnot yet been worked, such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis.\nGo to these places and labor for the people, but do not speak a word\nof censure regarding those who have tried so hard to do everything\nin their power for the advancement of the work. Sometimes these\nworkers would be almost discouraged, but we kept praying for them.\nWherever I was, I would ask the prayers of God\u2019s people in their\nbehalf.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 25, 1905.\nPhiladelphia, New Orleans, and St. Louis\u2014You speak of the\nwork which should be done in America, but which is undone. I\nwish to speak of these neglected fields as they are presented to me.\nI wish to speak, not merely in behalf of the Southern field, but in\nbehalf of the large cities, whose neglected, unwarned condition is a\ncondemnation to our people, who claim to be missionaries for the\nMaster....\nWe stand rebuked by God because the large cities right within\nour sight are unworked and unwarned. A terrible charge of neglect\nis brought against those who have been long in the work, in this very\nAmerica, and yet have not entered the large cities. What has been\ndone in Philadelphia, in New Orleans, in St. Louis, and in other\ncities that I might name? We have done none too much for foreign[402]\nfields, but we have done comparatively nothing for the great cities\nright beside our own doors.\u2014Letter 187, 1905.\nCities of the Central States\nNeeds of Large Cities, Including Detroit\u2014In New York, De-\ntroit, and many other large cities, little has been done. The cities of\nthe South, though kept before our people in the testimonies of God\u2019s\nSpirit, have been neglected. While I would not stay the hand that is\nstretched out to labor in far-off countries, I would have our people\nunderstand that there is a work to be done in the home field.\u2014Letter\n43, 1903.\nCleveland and Cincinnati\u2014The Lord has many precious souls\nin Cleveland, in Cincinnati, and other cities, who should be reached\nby the special truths for this time.\u2014Manuscript 19a, 1890.\nWarning Chicago From Rural Working Center \u2014For the\npresent, some will be obliged to labor in Chicago; but these should\nbe preparing working centers in rural districts, from which to work\nthe city. The Lord would have His people looking about them, and\nsecuring humble, inexpensive places as centers for their work. And\nfrom time to time, larger places will come to their notice, which they\nwill be able to secure at a surprisingly low price.\u2014Medical Ministry,\n305, 306 (1906).\nA Substantial Work in Denver \u2014As the matter is laid open\nbefore me, I see that there is need of substantial work being done in\nDenver. In the past many things have worked against the prosperity\nof the work there, and this unfavorable influence is not yet entirely\nremoved.\nThere is a large class of colored people in Denver. Let special [403]\nefforts be made for them, both by the white and the colored members\nof the church. Let the missionary spirit be awakened. Let earnest\nwork be done for those who know not the truth.\u2014Letter 84, 1901.\n359\nThe Western Cities\nThe Cities of California\u2014There is work to be done in Califor-\nnia,\u2014a work that has been strangely neglected. Let this work be\ndelayed no longer. As doors open for the presentation of truth, let\nus be ready to enter. Some work has been done in the large city of\nSan Francisco, but as we study the field we see plainly that only\na beginning has been made. As soon as possible, well-organized\nefforts should be put forth in different sections of this city, and also\nin Oakland. The wickedness of San Francisco is not realized. Our\nwork in this city must broaden and deepen. God sees in it many\nsouls to be saved.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:110 (1902).\nShall we not do all in our power to establish the work in the great\ncities of San Francisco and Oakland, and in all the other cities of\nCalifornia? Thousands upon thousands who live in the cities close\nby us need help in various ways. Let the ministers of the gospel\nrealize that the Lord Jesus Christ said to His disciples, \u201cYe are the\nlight of the world.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 79, 1900.\nWestern Tent Meetings\u2014Well-equipped tent meetings should\nbe held in the large cities, such as San Francisco; for not long hence\nthese cities will suffer under the judgments of God. [Note: Written\nin 1902.] San Francisco and Oakland are becoming as Sodom and[404]\nGomorrah, and the Lord will visit them in wrath.\u2014Manuscript 114,\n1902.\nThe Work Will Be Cut Short\u2014San Francisco has been visited\nwith heavy judgments, but Oakland has been thus far mercifully\nspared. The time will come when our labor in these places will be\ncut short, therefore it is important that earnest efforts be put forth\nnow to proclaim to their inhabitants the message of the Lord for\nthem.\u2014Manuscript 25, 1908.\nA Warning to San Francisco Workers\u2014The work going for-\nward in San Francisco is a good work. But at every step there must\nbe watchfulness and prayer; for many things will come in to confuse\nand entangle the workers. My brethren, the word has been given me\n360\nWestern Cities 361\nfor you, \u201cWatch and pray.\u201d Watch lest you stand in the way of the\nwork of God, making an impression that hurts the truth. Adorn your\nprofession by an honest conversation. Cherish the grace of the Holy\nSpirit, else you will stand as hindrances in the way of the work of\nGod. Make straight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out\nof the way.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1902.\nBay City Suburbs; Oakland\u2014My soul is filled with remorse\u2014\nI cannot word it in any other way\u2014that such places as this [Petaluma]\nshould be passed by. Once in a great while a minister has come to\nspeak to the believers, but no effort has been made to place the truth\nbefore the people. Why Petaluma should have been neglected is\nbeyond my comprehension. It is so near San Francisco, and yet it\nmight be as far off as Africa as far as any effort to proclaim the truth\nin it is concerned.\nA work is to be done in and around San Francisco and Oakland. [405]\nThe adjacent towns are to be worked. Oh, I see so much the need of\nour ministers getting the spirit of the loud cry before it is too late to\nwork for the conversion of souls.\u2014Letter 113, 1902.\nExperience With Open-Air Meetings in Resort Towns\u2014For\nsome months we have been planning to hold grove meetings near St.\nHelena, Calistoga, and other places in the Napa Valley. The first one\nwas held on Sunday, June 7, in the Hot Springs Park, at Calistoga.\nThe conference lent us some folding chairs. The members of the\nCalistoga church are anxious to carry the truth to those who have\nnot heard it, and they made thoughtful preparation for the meeting.\nWe were confident that open-air meetings would be the means of\nreaching some who would not attend a service held in a church. And\nthus they have proved.\nAlthough the day was oppressively warm, a goodly number\nwere present at the meeting. The Lord gave me much freedom in\nspeaking. The people seemed to enjoy the meeting very much, and\nan appointment was given out that meetings would be held in the\nsame place the following Sabbath and Sunday. Our people gathered\nearly Sunday morning, and spent the day together in the grove. A\nlarger number were present on the second Sunday than on the first.\nWe expect to continue these open-air meetings. I believe that by\nthem much good will be accomplished. The next one is to be held\nnear St. Helena, if a suitable place can be found.\n362 Evangelism\nWe desire to do all we can to warn those around us of the soon\ncoming of the Saviour. My heart is drawn out to those who know\nnot the truth for this time.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 14, 1903.\nIn Southern California\u2014There is a work to be done in Los\nAngeles. In Southern California and in many other places there[406]\nare promising opportunities for labor in connection with the health\nresorts. Our ministers and canvassers should be on the ground,\nwatching their chance to present the message, and holding meetings\nas they have opportunity....Let them speak the Word of God with\nclearness and power, that those who have ears to hear, may hear\nthe truth. Speakers should find their places in different localities in\nsouthern California to place the gospel of present truth in the way of\nthose who know it not.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1902.\nLos Angeles\u2014Special light has been given me regarding the\ncharacter and magnitude of the work to be done in Los Angeles.\nSeveral times messages have been given regarding the duty that rests\nupon us of proclaiming the third angel\u2019s message with power in that\ncity.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 2, 1905.\nRedlands and Riverside \u2014There is important work to do in\nRedlands and in Riverside. The churches in these places are to be\nadded to. Let the work advance.\u2014Letter 193, 1905.\nThe Message in Large Western Cities\u2014It would be a mistake\nto build or purchase large buildings in the cities of southern Califor-\nnia. Those who seem to see such great advantages in so doing are\nwithout understanding.\nThere is a great work to be done in sounding the gospel message\nfor this time in these large cities, but the fitting up of large buildings\nfor some apparently wonderful work has been a mistake. The Lord\nwould have men walk humbly with Him. The message of warning\nshould be sounded in the large, wicked cities.\u2014Manuscript 30, 1903.\nSection 12\u2014Heralding the Message in [407]\nOther Continents\nSounding the Message in Europe\nThe Whole Earth to Be Illuminated \u2014At this time there\nshould be representatives of present truth in every city, and in the\nremote parts of the earth. The whole earth is to be illuminated with\nthe glory of God\u2019s truth. The light is to shine to all lands and all\npeoples. And it is from those who have received the light that it is to\nshine forth....\nCertain countries have advantages that mark them as centers\nof education and influence. In the English-speaking nations and\nthe Protestant nations of Europe it is comparatively easy to find\naccess to the people, and there are many advantages for establishing\ninstitutions and carrying forward our work....America has many\ninstitutions to give character to the work. Similar facilities should\nbe furnished for England, Australia, Germany, and Scandinavia, and\nother continental countries as the work advances. In these countries\nthe Lord has able workmen, laborers of experience. These can\nlead out in the establishment of institutions, the training of workers,\nand the carrying forward of the work in its different lines. God\ndesigns that they shall be furnished with means and facilities. The\ninstitutions established would give character to the work in other\ncountries, and would give opportunity for the training of workers[408]\nfor the darker heathen nations. In this way the efficiency of our\nexperienced workers would be multiplied a hundredfold....\nIt pains me to think that greater facilities are not provided for the\nwork throughout Europe. I have sore heartache as I think of the work\nin Switzerland, Germany, Norway, and Sweden. Where there are\none or two men struggling to carry forward the different branches of\nthe cause, there should be hundreds at work.\u2014Testimonies for the\nChurch 6:24-26 (1900).\nGreat Work in Europe\u2014There is a great work to be done in\nEurope. All heaven takes an interest not only in lands that are\nnigh and that need our help, but in lands that are afar off. All the\ninhabitants of heaven are in active service, ministering to a fallen\n364\nSounding the Message in Europe 365\nworld. They take a deep and fervent interest in the salvation of men,\nthe fallen inhabitants of this world.\u2014Manuscript 65, 1900.\nA great work is committed to those who present the truth in\nEurope.... There are France and Germany, with their great cities\nand teeming population. There are Italy, Spain, and Portugal, after\nso many centuries of darkness, ... opened to the Word of God\u2014\nopened to receive the last message of warning to the world. There\nare Holland, Austria, Rumania, Turkey, Greece, and Russia, the\nhome of millions upon millions, whose souls are as precious in the\nsight of God as our own, who know nothing of the special truths for\nthis time....\nA good work has already been done in these countries. There\nare those who have received the truth, scattered as light bearers in\nalmost every land.... But how little has been done in comparison\nwith the great work before us! Angels of God are moving upon the [409]\nminds of the people, and preparing them to receive the warning.\nMissionaries are needed in fields that have yet been scarcely entered.\nNew fields are constantly opening. The truth must be translated into\ndifferent languages, that all nations may enjoy its pure, life-giving\ninfluences.\u2014Life Sketches of Ellen G. White, 304, 305 (1915).\nThe Call for a Broad, Substantial Work\u2014The time has come\nfor much to be accomplished in Europe. A large work, such as\nhas been done in America, can be done in Europe. Let sanitariums\nbe established, let hygienic restaurants be started. Let the light of\npresent truth shine forth from the press. Let the work of translating\nour books go forward. I have been shown that in the European\ncountries lights will be kindled in many places.\nThere are many places where the Lord\u2019s work has not a proper\nshowing. Help is needed in Italy, in France, in Scotland, and in\nmany other countries. A larger work should be done in these places.\nLaborers are needed. There is talent among God\u2019s people in Europe,\nand the Lord desires this talent to be employed in establishing all\nthrough Great Britain and the continent centers from which the light\nof his truth may shine forth.\nThere is a work to be done in Scandinavia. God is just as will-\ning to work through Scandinavian believers as through American\nbelievers.\n366 Evangelism\nMy brethren, bind up with the Lord God of hosts. Let Him be\nyour fear, and let Him be your dread. The time has come for His\nwork to be enlarged. Troublous times are before us, but if we stand\ntogether in Christian fellowship, none striving for supremacy, God\nwill work mightily for us.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 8:38 (1904).\nGreater Effort Needed in Europe\u2014It will require far greater[410]\neffort to accomplish the work than in America because of the poverty\nof the people. Then the ministers are so plentiful. We think of\nthe words of the apostle, They shall \u201cheap to themselves teachers\nhaving itching ears.\u201d As soon as the truth is brought to the place the\nministers of the different churches become alarmed and send at once\nfor ministers to come in and commence revival meetings. Here they\nare called conferences. These meetings will continue for weeks, and\nno less than ten ministers will be on hand; the very best talent will\nbe enlisted, and warnings and threatenings will be poured out from\nthe churches against the seventh-day people, who are classed with\nMormons, and who they say are breaking up churches and causing\ndivisions.\nIt is very hard to get any hold of the people. The only way that\nwe find to be successful is in holding Bible readings, and in this way\nthe interest is started with one or two or three; then these visit others\nand try to interest others, and thus the work moves slowly as it has\ndone in Lausanne; but twenty have embraced the truth there, and this\nis not all the good that has been accomplished, for the young men\nwho are preparing themselves for laborers have here had a good drill\nand received an education that will fit them for greater usefulness in\nthe cause of God.\u2014Letter 44, 1886.\nReaching European State Church Members\u2014From the light\nthat has been given me concerning the people in this part of the\ncountry, and perhaps all through Europe, there is danger, in pre-\nsenting the truth, of arousing their combativeness. There is little\nharmony between present truth and the doctrines of the church in\nwhich many of the people have been born and brought up; and they[411]\nare so filled with prejudice, and so completely under the control of\ntheir ministers, that in many cases they dare not even come to hear\nthe truth presented. The question then arises, How can these people\nbe reached? How can the great work of the third angel\u2019s message\nbe accomplished? It must be largely accomplished by persevering,\nSounding the Message in Europe 367\nindividual effort; by visiting the people at their homes.\u2014Historical\nSketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists,\n149, 150 (1886).\nThe Silent Messenger\u2014\u201cBut,\u201d says one, \u201csuppose we cannot\ngain admittance to the homes of the people; and if we do, suppose\nthey rise up against the truths that we present. Shall we not then feel\nexcused from making further efforts for them?\u201d By no means. Even\nif they shut the door in your face, do not hasten away in indignation,\nand make no further effort to save them. Ask God in faith to give\nyou access to those very souls. Cease not your efforts, but study and\nplan until you find some other means of reaching them. If you do\nnot succeed by personal visits, try sending them the silent messenger\nof truth. There is so much pride of opinion in the human heart that\nour publications often gain admittance where the living messenger\ncannot.\nI have been shown how reading matter on present truth is some-\ntimes treated by many people in Europe and in other countries. A\nperson receives a tract or paper. He reads a little in it, finds some-\nthing that does not agree with his former views, and throws it aside.\nBut the few words he did read are not forgotten. Unwelcome though\nthey are, they remain in the mind until an interest is awakened to\nread further on the subject. Again the paper is taken up; again the\nreader finds something in it that is opposed to his long-cherished\nopinions and customs, and he angrily flings it aside. But the rejected [412]\nmessenger says nothing to increase his opposition or arouse his\ncombativeness; and when the force of his anger dies away, and the\npaper is again brought out, it tells the same simple, straightforward\nstory, and he finds in it precious gems. Angels of God are near\nto impress the unspoken word upon his heart; and, although loath\nto do so, he at last yields, and light takes possession of his soul.\nThose who are thus unwillingly converted, often prove to be among\nthe most substantial believers; and their experience teaches them to\nlabor perseveringly for others.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign\nMissions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 150 (1886).\nOpen-Air and Tent Meetings \u2014I was requested to speak in\nregard to holding tent meetings in Europe. I told them according\nto the light the Lord had given me, tents could be used to good\nadvantage in some places, and if conducted properly would result in\n368 Evangelism\ngreat good. I did not know at this time why they called me out on\nthis, but learned that it was because Brother _____ had previously\nspoken rather against tents being the best for meetinghouse purposes.\nI then presented my objections in regard to open-air meetings.\nIt was very wearing to our ministers, because taxing to the vocal\norgans. The voice was strained to an unnatural pitch, and would be\ngreatly injured by this method of labor. Another objection was that\ndiscipline and order could not be preserved; such labor would not\nencourage studious habits in diligently searching the Scriptures to\nbring from God\u2019s storehouse things both new and old.\u2014Letter 2,\n1885.\nGod Will Work Mightily\u2014There is a great work to be done\nin Europe. It may seem to move slowly and hard at first; but God\nwill work mightily through you if you will only make an entire\nsurrender to Him. Much of the time you will have to walk by faith,[413]\nnot by feeling.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the\nSeventh-day Adventists, 128, 129 (1886).\nTo the Ends of the Earth\u2014The light of truth is to shine to the\nends of the earth. Greater and still greater light is beaming with\ncelestial brightness from the Redeemer\u2019s face upon His representa-\ntives, to be diffused through the darkness of a benighted world. As\nlaborers together with Him, let us pray for the sanctification of His\nSpirit, that we may shine more and more brightly....\nOur efforts are not to be confined to a few places where the\nlight has become so abundant that it is not appreciated. The gospel\nmessage is to be proclaimed to all nations and kindreds and tongues\nand peoples.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 8:40 (1904).\nTo Belt the World\u2014God has qualified His people to enlighten\nthe world. He has entrusted men with faculties that adapt them to\nextend and accomplish a work that will belt the world. Sanitariums,\nschools, printing offices, and kindred facilities are to be established\nin all parts of the earth.\nBut this work has not yet been done. In foreign countries many\nenterprises that require means must yet be begun and carried for-\nward. The opening of hygienic restaurants, the establishment of\nsanitariums for the care of the sick and suffering, is just as necessary\nin Germany as in America. Let all do their best, making their boast\nin the Lord, and blessing others by their good works.\nSounding the Message in Europe 369\nChrist co-operates with those who engage in medical missionary\nwork. Men and women who unselfishly do what they can to estab-\nlish sanitariums and treatment rooms in many lands will be richly\nrewarded. Those who visit these institutions will be benefited physi-\ncally, mentally, and spiritually. The weary will be refreshed, the sick [414]\nwill be restored to health, and the sin-burdened will be relieved. In\nfar-off countries thanksgiving will be heard from the lips of those\nwhose hearts are turned from the service of sin unto righteousness.\nBy their songs of grateful praise a testimony is borne that will win\nother souls to the truth.\u2014Letter 121, 1902.\nEngland and Its Cities\nHow Are They to Be Warned? \u2014Here are the great cities in\nEngland and on the continent with their millions of inhabitants that\nhave not yet heard the last warning message. How are these to be\nwarned? If the people of God would only exercise faith, He would\nwork in a wonderful manner to accomplish this work. Hear the\nwords of Christ: \u201cIf two of you shall agree on earth as touching\nanything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father\nwhich is in heaven.\u201d Precious promise! Do we believe it? What\nmarvelous results would appear if the united prayers of this company\nwere to ascend to God in living faith! Jesus stands ready to take\nthese petitions and present them to His Father, saying, \u201cI know these\npersons by name. Send answers to their prayers; for I have graven\ntheir names on the palms of My hands.\u201d\u2014Historical Sketches of the\nForeign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 152 (1886).\nPresenting the Truth in London\u2014There is need of zeal in the\nchurch, and wisdom to manage that zeal. You have made altogether\ntoo tame work of saving souls. If you see a work done in London\nand the surrounding cities, you must have a united, irresistible force;\npress the battle to the gate, and plant the standard firmly, as if you\nmeant that the truth should triumph. The timidity, the cautious\nmovements, have been faithless; there has been little expectation of[415]\nresults....\nThe fact that things move slowly in England is no reason why\nthe great missionary work shall move slowly to meet men\u2019s habits\nand customs for fear of surprising the people. They need to be\nmuch more surprised than they have hitherto been. The Lord\u2019s\nbusiness requires haste; souls are perishing without a knowledge of\nthe truth....\nCaution is needed; but while some of the workers are guarded,\nand make haste slowly, if there are not united with them in the work\nthose who see the necessity of being aggressive, very much will be\n370\nEngland and Its Cities 371\nlost, opportunities will pass, and the opening providence of God will\nnot be discerned.\u2014Letter 31, 1892.\nA Great Work in England\u2014There is a great work to be done\nin England. The light radiating from London should beam forth in\nclear, distinct rays to regions beyond. God has wrought in England,\nbut this English-speaking world has been terribly neglected. England\nhas needed many more laborers and much more means. London has\nbeen scarcely touched. My heart is deeply moved as the situation in\nthat great city is presented before me....\nIn the city of London alone no fewer than one hundred men\nshould be engaged. The Lord marks the neglect of His work, and\nthere will be a heavy account to settle by and by.\u2014Testimonies for\nthe Church 6:25, 26 (1900).\nAn Army of Workers\u2014It seems to me that the necessity of the\nwork in England is a very important question to us in this country.\nWe talk about China and other countries. Let us not forget the\nEnglish-speaking countries, where, if the truth were presented, many\nwould receive and practice it.\nWhy is it that more work has not been done in England? What [416]\nhas been the matter? The workers could not get means. Does not\nthis speak to us of the necessity of economy in every line? ...\nLet no one suppose that the work in London can be carried\nforward by one or two. This is not the right plan. While there must\nbe those who can oversee the work, there is to be an army of workers\nstriving to reach the different classes of people. House-to-house\nwork must be done.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, April 22,\n1901.\nFinancial Help Will Come \u2014There is a work to be done in\nLondon. I have been given light that this work can be done, and\nthat help will come from outside. Those who have money will give\nof their means. You need not be delicate about asking them for\nmoney.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, April 22, 1901.\nPlace of Meeting; Hire Good Halls \u2014The work in England\nmight now be much farther advanced than it is if our brethren, at the\nbeginning of the work there, had not tried to work in so cheap a way.\nIf they had hired good halls, and carried forward the work as though\nwe had great truths, which would surely be victorious, they would\nhave had greater success. God would have the work started in such\n372 Evangelism\na way that the first impressions given shall be, as far as they go, the\nvery best that can be made.\u2014Gospel Workers, 462 (1915).\nCaste and Class Problems\u2014True, there are many difficulties\nto be met in presenting the truth even in Christian England. One of\nthe greatest of these is the difference in the condition of the three\nprincipal classes, and the feeling of caste, which is very strong in\nthis country. In the city the capitalists, the shop-keepers, and the day\nlaborers, and in the country the landlords, the tenant farmers, and the[417]\nfarm laborers, form three general classes, between whom there are\nwide differences in education, in sentiment, and in circumstances.\nIt is very difficult for one person to labor for all classes at the same\ntime. Wealth means greatness and power; poverty, little less than\nslavery. This is an order of things that God never designed should\nexist.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-\nday Adventists, 164 (1886).\nThe Higher Classes Reached Through Lower\u2014In a country\nwhere so large a part of the people are kept in such a state of servitude\nto the wealthy, and the higher classes are held in bondage by long-\nestablished customs, it is only to be expected that the advancement\nof unpopular truth will at first be slow. But if the brethren will\nbe patient, and the laborers will be fully awake and thoroughly\nin earnest to improve every opportunity which presents itself for\nspreading the light, we are sure that an abundant harvest of souls will\nyet be reaped from English soil. By tact and perseverance, ample\nmeans will be found for reaching the people.\nThere will no doubt always be difficulty in reaching the higher\nclasses. But the truth will often find its way to the noblemen by first\nreaching the middle and poorer classes.\u2014Historical Sketches of the\nForeign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 166 (1886).\nA Careful Work Called For\u2014Because you do not see the same\nresults in old England that you did in Australia you should not\ndemerit that which has already been gained. There are some precious\nsouls in Grimsby, in Ulceby, and others will be gathered in. There are\nsome good souls in Southampton, and the brother I met at Brother_-\n____\u2019s and the few who are connected with him are, I judge, good\nmaterial. Because they do not see every point just as we do requires\nwisdom in treating their cases, that we should unite wherever we[418]\ncan and not make the breach any greater between us.\nEngland and Its Cities 373\nThat Sister_____, I believe, will come to the front if wise man-\nagement is exercised in her case. Such ones must not be left indif-\nferently, but efforts should be made to bring them into the noble\ntruth. We want that woman as a worker.... It is a nice work to hunt\nup the sheep and to make every exertion to bring them in. It will\ntake time to rid them of all their strange ideas and erratic views, but\nwe must be patient and not drive them from us. God is working with\nthem, and as I look over the past I see discouragements just as great\nthat we have had to master and still have to contend with as in old\nEngland.\u2014Letter 50, 1887.\nGod Will Care for the Faithful in England \u2014Accompanied\nby Brother S. H. Lane, we went to Risely, a small town about forty\nmiles from London. Here Brethren Lane and Durland had been\nholding a tent meeting for four weeks. The tent seated about three\nhundred, and in the evening it was full, and a large number stood\noutside.\nMy heart was especially drawn out for this people, and I would\ngladly have remained longer with them. Of the audience it could be\nsaid, There were honorable women not a few. Several of those had\ncommenced to keep the Sabbath. Many of the men were convinced\nof the truth; but the question with them was not whether they could\nkeep the Sabbath and have the conveniences and luxuries of life, but\nwhether they could obtain bread, simple bread, for their children.\nSome conscientious souls have begun to keep the Sabbath. The faith\nof such will be severely tested. But will not He who careth for the\nravens care much more for those who love and fear Him? God\u2019s eye\nis upon His conscientious, faithful children in England, and He will [419]\nmake a way for them to keep all His commandments.\u2014Historical\nSketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists,\n163 (1886).\nThe Cities of Northern Europe\nCome Up to the Help of the Lord \u2014In my last vision I was\nshown the importance of the work in Northern Europe. The people\nare awakening to the truth. The Lord has given Elder Matteson a\ntestimony to reach hearts. But the work is just entered upon. With\njudicious, self-sacrificing labor, many souls will be brought to the\nknowledge of the truth. There should be several unselfish, God-\nfearing workers in this missionary field, who will labor for souls as\nthey that must give account in the day of judgment.\nI have been shown that not all is being done by our Swedish,\nNorwegian, and Danish brethren that they might and should do for\ntheir own countrymen. As soon as they embrace the truth, they ought\nto feel the fire of missionary zeal kindled in their hearts for their\nbrethren in the darkness of error. Many are looking for help from\ntheir American brethren while they do not do their duty and feel the\nburden God requires them to feel for those of their own nation. They\nmay do very much more than they are now doing if they will. These\nbrethren must overcome selfishness and arouse to a sense of their\nresponsibilities to God and their fellow countrymen, or they will\nlose the precious reward they might secure by putting their talents\nof means into the treasury of God, and by wisely directed personal\neffort, thus being instrumental in the salvation of many souls.\nYoung men should be educated to become missionaries to their\nown nation, to teach the truth to those in darkness. Publications[420]\nshould be printed in Europe. But at the present time [Note: Written\nin 1879.] there is altogether too much ease and too little zeal among\nthe Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians who believe the truth in this\ncountry to sustain such a continual drain upon their funds. And\nfor this reason I urge upon them the necessity of coming up into\nworking order, feeling even a greater interest for their own people\nthan their American brethren have shown. God requires that these\nbrethren should come up to the help of the Lord without delay.\u2014The\nAdvent Review Supplement, February 6, 1879.\n374\nCities of Northern Europe 375\nHabits and Customs Vary, but Human Nature Is the Same\u2014\nYou must go to work here just as we did in America; have your tract\nsocieties and other facilities, and although it may seem at times that\nthe publications in some places do not accomplish much, you must\ngo right on. We had just such experiences in America. But we kept\nto the point in sending out these publications to different classes,\nand it was some time before we could make any advancement.\nI have been shown that there must be a different mold put upon\nthe work here in these kingdoms, and there must be a power from\nthe God of heaven to inspire you to work in a different way; and\nwhile Brethren Matteson and Olsen will help you in the work here, I\nwish to throw this out to you now so that you can begin to think in a\ndifferent strain. Why, you can do tenfold more than you think you\ncan; but unbelief stands right here to say you cannot do anything in\nthis line, or that, but you can, brethren.\nHabits and customs are different here from what they are in\nAmerica, but human nature is the same here as there, and the brethren\nwho have taken hold of the truth in the heart are willing to work if [421]\nthey are only educated up to the point to know how to work. Why,\nbrethren, I have not slept night after night more than three hours,\nthinking of the work in Europe, and it seems to me that I can hardly\ncontain myself in the body when I realize these things.\nI have seen what God is willing to do for you, but it is just\naccording to your faith what God will do for you. Therefore we\nwant to arouse your faith, and to get your ideas broadened, and may\nthe Lord roll the burden of the work upon every one of you who\nbelieve the truth.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1886.\nBroad Plans for Copenhagen\u2014If in this rich and beautiful city\n[Copenhagen] there is no suitable room where the truth can be\npresented to the people, we remember that there was no room in the\ninn at Bethlehem for the mother of Jesus, and that the Saviour of the\nworld was born in a stable....\nI am far from being convinced that these small and obscure\nhalls were the best places that could be secured, or that in this great\ncity of three hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants, the message\nshould be given in a basement room that will accommodate but\ntwo hundred, and this but half seated, so that a large part of the\ncongregation have to stand. When God sends our brethren help, they\n376 Evangelism\nshould make earnest effort, even at some expense, to bring the light\nbefore the people. This message is to be given to the world; but\nunless our brethren have broad ideas and plans, they will not see\nmuch accomplished.\nWhile we should labor earnestly for the poorer classes, we are\nnot to confine our efforts to them, nor should our plans be so laid that\nwe shall have only this class of hearers. Men of ability are needed.\nThe more intellectual ability is brought into the work, so long as[422]\nthe talent is consecrated to God and sanctified by His Spirit, the\nmore perfect the work will be, and the higher it will stand before the\nworld. The people generally will refuse the message of warning; yet\nefforts must be made to bring the truth before those of position and\neducation as well as the poor and illiterate.\u2014Historical Sketches\nof the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 183, 184\n(1886).\nSweden\u2019s Hall Problem\u2014In Orebro, as well as in Copenhagen,\nI am convinced that we might have had a good hearing if our brethren\nhad secured a suitable hall to accommodate the people. But they did\nnot expect much, and therefore did not receive much. We cannot\nexpect people to come out to hear unpopular truth when the meetings\nare advertised to be held in a basement, or in a small hall that\nwill seat only a hundred persons. The character and importance\nof our work are judged by the efforts made to bring it before the\npublic. When these efforts are so limited, the impression is given\nthat the message we present is not worthy of notice. Thus by their\nlack of faith our laborers sometimes make the work very hard for\nthemselves.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the\nSeventh-day Adventists, 200 (1886).\nNorthern Europe\u2019s Harvest Evident\u2014I was shown that many\nin Northern Europe had embraced the truth through reading. Their\nsouls were hungering for light and knowledge when some tracts\nor papers came into their hands, and they were represented to me\nas reading. The wants of their souls were met; the Spirit of God\nsoftened and impressed their hearts; tears were in their eyes, and\nsobs came from burdened hearts. They knelt with the leaflets in their\nhands, and with earnest prayer besought the Lord to lead them and\nhelp them to receive the light as it was from Him. Some surrendered\nthemselves to God. Uncertainty was gone; and as they accepted the\nCities of Northern Europe 377\ntruth upon the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, they felt that [423]\nthey were indeed standing upon the Rock of Ages. Many persons\nscattered all through Northern Europe were presented to me as being\nready to accept the light of truth.\u2014The Advent Review Supplement,\nFebruary 6, 1879.\nIn Southern Europe\nPreaching and Personal Ministry in Italy\u2014The Piedmont val-\nleys have been spoken of. From the light that I have had, there are,\nall through these valleys, precious souls who will receive the truth. I\nhave no personal knowledge of these places; but they were presented\nto me as being in some way connected with God\u2019s work of the past.\nHe now has an advance step for this people to take.\nThose who labor in these valleys must take a deep interest in\ntheir work, or they will not succeed. The third angel is represented\nas flying through the midst of heaven. The work is one that must\nbe done quickly. They must keep in working order, laboring intelli-\ngently and with consecration, and be prepared by the grace of God\nto meet opposition.\nThey are not only to preach, but to minister. As they go forth to\nlabor, they are to make personal efforts for the people, coming heart\nto heart with them, as they open to them the Scriptures. There may\nat first be only a few here and there who will accept the truth; but\nwhen these are truly converted, they will labor for others, and soon,\nwith proper efforts, larger companies will be raised up, and the work\nwill move forward more rapidly.\nThere is a great work yet to be accomplished in all the fields\nfrom which we have heard reports. All through these countries there[424]\nis precious talent that God will use; and we must be wide awake\nto secure it.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the\nSeventh-day Adventists, 147 (1886).\nMany Will Take Their Stand for the Truth\u2014The angel that\njoins the third angel is to lighten the earth with his glory. There will\nbe many, even in these valleys (in northern Italy), where the work\nseems to start with such difficulty, who will recognize the voice of\nGod speaking to them through His Word, and, coming out from\nunder the influence of the clergy, will take their stand for God and\nthe truth. This field is not an easy one in which to labor, nor is it one\nwhich will show immediate results; but there is an honest people\n378\nIn Southern Europe 379\nhere who will obey in time.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign\nMissions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 249 (1886).\nEffective Personal Work in Italy\u2014It is not always pleasant for\nour brethren to live where the people need help most; but their labors\nwould often be productive of far more good if they would do so.\nThey ought to come close to the people, sit with them at their tables,\nand lodge in their humble homes. The laborers may have to take their\nfamilies to places not at all desirable; but they should remember that\nJesus did not remain in the most desirable places. He came down\nto earth that He might help those who needed help.\u2014Historical\nSketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists,\n148 (1886).\nUnless the attention of the people is gained, all effort for them\nwill be useless. The Word of God cannot be understood by the\ninattentive. They need a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d to arrest their\nattention. Let them see that their cases are tried and condemned\nby the Bible, not by the lips of man; that they are arraigned at the\nbar of infinite justice, not before an earthly tribunal. When the\nplain, cutting truth of the Bible is presented before them, it comes\ndirectly across long-cherished desires and confirmed habits. They [425]\nare convicted, and then it is that they specially need your counsel,\nencouragement, and prayer. Many a precious soul balances for a\ntime, and then takes his position on the side of error, because he does\nnot have this personal effort at the right time.\u2014Historical Sketches\nof the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 148 (1886).\nWorking the Australasian Cities\nMany Souls From Sydney\u2014There is a work to do all over the\nworld, and as we near the time of the end, the Lord will impress\nmany minds to engage in this work. If you are able to use your\ninfluence in setting in operation the work that needs to be done in\nSydney, many souls will be saved who have never yet heard the truth.\nThe cities are to be worked. The saving power of God is to go forth\nthrough them as a lamp that burneth.\u2014Letter 79, 1905.\nOpportune Evangelism in Sydney\u2014There is now a more de-\ncided work to be done in Sydney and the vicinity. All the suburbs\nare in a better condition to be worked than at any former period, and\nthe advantages now presented in doing medical missionary work\nneed more calculation and experience brought into the management\nof the work....\nThere are many branches that will grow out of the plant now\nmade in Sydney, and every line of work needs experienced managers,\nthat part may unite with part, making a harmonious whole.\u2014Letter\n63a, 1898.\nPromises More in Some Lands\u2014The medical missionary work\npromises to do more in Australia than it has in America to open the\nway for the truth to gain access to the people. May the Lord\u2019s people\nnow heed the invitations of God\u2019s opening providence, and realize[426]\nthat it is an opportune time to work.\u2014Letter 41, 1899.\nEvery Town and Village to Hear\u2014There are many places to\nbe worked. Every town or village on the railway is to have the\nmessage the Lord has given us. We cannot stop to rejoice over a few\nvictories. We must press the battle to the very gate. The Lord has\nnever left Himself without a witness. The truth must be presented in\nthe different suburbs of Newcastle. At times we may have to speak\nin the open air. I have done this on two Sunday afternoons with good\nresults. . . .\nThere is Auburn, a place eight miles from Cooranbong, where\nthey have secured a church in which I am to speak as soon as I can\n380\nWorking the Australasian Cities 381\nfind time, which will be next Sunday, or one week from Sunday. If\nthey had not given us permission to speak in the church, we should\nhave held a meeting in the open air.\u2014Letter 76, 1899.\nExperience in the Rural Areas\u2014We are now holding meetings\nin the open air. I have spoken twice recently to ninety people at Dora\nCreek, a place three miles from Cooranbong, and two weeks ago last\nSunday at Martinsville, in a grassy paddock, to sixty souls. Planks\nhad been arranged in a half circle for seats. Some were seated on\nrugs on the grass; others were in carriages just outside the fence.\nThere is no other way to reach these people but by holding open-\nair meetings. There seemed to be a deep interest manifested by some.\nTwo or three are now on the point of deciding, and the ripening fields\nare all ready for the harvest. Unless we make decided effort to go\noutside our own immediate circle to meet the people where they are,\nwe shall miss the saving of many souls.\nThere is not the least chance of getting into the little rough [427]\nchurches in the bush. We have been refused all chance to speak\nto the people in this way. But in the Lord\u2019s great temple, the open\nair\u2014the heavens our dome, and the earth our floor\u2014we can obtain\nhearers who otherwise would not hear. We feel intensely over the\nmatter of lifting the standard of truth in these places. The people\nhave no shepherd. The state church in Cooranbong stands locked\nweek after week, and the people hear no preaching. We see that\nthere is a great work to be done in out-of-the-way places in the open\nair. I have an appointment for such a meeting next Sunday afternoon\nat Dora Creek. We have now two places where these meetings are\nheld.\u2014Letter 79, 1899.\nExperience in Reaching Those Who Would Not Enter a\nHall\u2014I see so much to do. I cannot see any place where I can\nlet go my hold. Souls are perishing, and I must help them. I speak\nin the church and out of the church. We drive out into the country\nplaces, and speak in the open air, because the prejudice against the\ntruth is so great that the people will not consent to our speaking in\nthe little rough house where they assemble for worship....\nOn Sunday we went to Dora Creek, three miles away, and spoke\nto the people in the open air. About ninety persons were gathered\nthere, and I had much freedom in presenting to them Christ as the\ngreat Healer and wonderful Teacher. All listened with interest. By\n382 Evangelism\nthis means I can reach a class who will not come to any hall or\nmeetinghouse. We have good singing.\u2014Letter 74, 1899.\nA Great Work Called for in New Zealand \u2014We see a great\nwork to be done in this field, and long to have facilities to work\nwith. I will speak of Wellington. It is a place where churches are[428]\nabundant and [there are] plenty of ministers....This is the capital and\ngreat center of New Zealand. A mission should be established here.\nA church, if ever so humble, should be erected.\u2014Letter 9a, 1893.\nCities of Europe, Australia, and Regions Beyond \u2014There is\nmeans now tied up that should be in use for the unworked cities in\nEurope, Australia, and America, and in the regions beyond. These\ncities have been neglected for years. The angels of God are waiting\nfor us to give our labors for their inhabitants. From town to town,\nfrom city to city, from country to country, the warning message is\nto be proclaimed, not with outward display, but in the power of the\nSpirit, by men of faith.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1908.\nSection 13\u2014Personal Work [429]\nThe Need for Personal Work\nPublic Effort and Personal Work\u2014Of equal importance with\npublic effort is house-to-house work in the homes of the people.\nAs the result of the presentation of truth in large congregations,\na spirit of inquiry is awakened, and it is especially important that\nthis interest be followed by personal labor. Those who desire to\ninvestigate the truth need to be taught to study diligently the Word of\nGod. Someone must help them to build on a sure foundation. At this\ncritical time in their religious experience, how important it is that\nwisely directed Bible workers come to their help, and open to their\nunderstanding the treasure house of God\u2019s Word!\u2014Gospel Workers,\n364 (1915).\nCultivate the Soil\u2014When a discourse is given, precious seed\nis sown. But if personal effort is not made to cultivate the soil, the\nseed does not take root. Unless the heart is softened and subdued\nby the Spirit of God, much of the discourse is lost. Observe those\nin the congregation who seem to be interested, and speak to them\nafter the service. A few words spoken in private will often do more\ngood than the whole discourse has done. Inquire how the subjects\npresented appear to the hearers, whether the matter is clear to their\nminds. By kindness and courtesy show that you have a real interest[430]\nin them and a care for their souls.\u2014Testimonies for the Church 6:68\n(1900).\nCome Close to Individuals\u2014In Christlike sympathy the minis-\nter should come close to men individually, and seek to awaken their\ninterest in the great things of eternal life. Their hearts may be as\nhard as the beaten highway, and apparently it may be a useless effort\nto present the Saviour to them; but while logic may fail to move,\nand argument be powerless to convince, the love of Christ, revealed\nin personal ministry, may soften the stony heart, so that the seed of\ntruth can take root.\u2014Gospel Workers, 185 (1915).\nPlaces to Be Worked, Not Just Preached To\u2014The cities are\nto be worked, not merely preached to; there must be house-to-house\n384\nNeed for Personal Work 385\nlabor. After the warning has been given, after the truth has been\npresented from the Scriptures, many souls will be convicted.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, October 14, 1902.\nLess Sermonizing, More Personal Work \u2014If one half of the\nsermonizing were done, and double the amount of personal labor\ngiven to souls in their homes and in the congregations, a result would\nbe seen that would be surprising.\u2014Manuscript 139, 1897.\nOpportunities Lost\u2014When personal work is neglected, many\nprecious opportunities are lost, which, were they improved, would\nadvance the work decidedly.\u2014Gospel Workers, 364 (1915).\nSouls Perishing for Lack of Personal Work\u2014We may speak\nwords of encouragement to those whom we meet. \u201cA word spoken in\nseason, how good is it!\u201d Souls are perishing for the lack of personal\nlabor.\u2014Letter 151, 1903.\nInstant in and out of Season\u2014The minister must be instant in [431]\nseason and out of season, ready to seize and improve every oppor-\ntunity to further the work of God. To be \u201cinstant in season\u201d is to\nbe alert to the privileges of the house and hour of worship, and to\nthe times when men are conversing on topics of religion. And to\nbe instant \u201cout of season\u201d is to be ready, when at the fireside, in\nthe field, by the wayside, in the market, to turn the minds of men,\nin a suitable manner, to the great themes of the Bible, with tender,\nfervent spirit urging upon them the claims of God. Many, many\nsuch opportunities are allowed to slip by unimproved, because men\nare persuaded that it is out of season. But who knows what might\nbe the effect of a wise appeal to the conscience?\u2014Gospel Workers,\n186-187(1915).\nLove Souls as Christ Loved\u2014We are called upon to love souls\nas Christ loved them, to feel a travail of soul that sinners shall be\nconverted. Present the matchless love of Christ. Hide self out of\nsight.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1898.\nHouse-to-House Visitation\nHouse-to-House Work\u2014Not only is the truth to be presented\nin public assemblies; house-to-house work is to be done. Let this\nwork go forward in the name of the Lord.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nAugust 11, 1903.\nThis house-to-house labor, searching for souls, hunting for the\nlost sheep, is the most essential work that can be done.\u2014Letter 137,\n1898.\nThe Objective of House-to-House Labor\u2014Our people make\na great mistake when, after holding a camp meeting and gathering a\nfew souls, they take down the tents and feel that their duty is done.\nTheir work had only just begun. They have preached doctrines that[432]\nare new and strange to the people who heard them, and then left the\nseed sown to be picked up by the birds, or else to wither away for\nwant of moisture....\nAfter the truth has been presented to souls, there are those, min-\nisters, friends, and acquaintances, who will pick up the seed sown\nif possible. These human birds make the truth appear as error, and\ndo not give the one convicted any rest until they have devoured the\nseed by false assertions.\nWhat should be done? After the camp meeting is over, establish\na mission. Let the very best workers that can be found be organized\ninto a company to sell our literature and also give away papers to\nsome that cannot buy. Preparatory work is not of one half the value\nthat the afterwork is.\nAfter the people have heard the reasons of our faith, let the house-\nto-house work begin. Become acquainted with the people and read\nto them the precious words of Christ. Lift up Jesus crucified among\nthem, and soon those who have listened to the messages of warning\nfrom the ministers of God in the tent, and have been convicted, will\nbe drawn out to inquire in regard to what they have heard. This is the\ntime to present the reasons of our faith, with meekness and fear, not\na slavish fear, but a cautious fear lest you should speak unadvisedly.\n386\nHouse-to-House Visitation 387\nPresent the truth as it is in Jesus, with all meekness and lowliness,\nwhich means with simplicity and in sincerity, giving meat in due\nseason, and to every man his portion of meat.\u2014Letter 18, 1898.\nPreaching Made Effectual by House-to-House Labor\u2014From\nthe experience of the workers in _____, we see that the efforts made\nafter a camp meeting has closed are of far more consequence than the\nwork done before. For years I have been shown that house-to-house [433]\nlabor is the work that will make the preaching of the word a success.\nIf those interested are not visited by our workers, other ministers\nget upon their tracks and confuse them by misquoting and wresting\nthe Scriptures. These people are not familiar with the Word; they\nthink that their ministers must be true and unprejudiced men, and\nthey give up their convictions. But if our workers can visit those\ninterested, to explain the Word of truth to them more fully, revealing\nthe truth in contrast to error, they will become established.\nHad this work been done earnestly and vigilantly, had the work-\ners perseveringly watched for souls as they that must give an account,\nmany more sheaves would have been the fruit of the seed sown at\nour camp meetings.\nThis work has also been carried on in _____. There are now\nno less than fifty new Sabbathkeepers as the result of this personal\nlabor, this hunting for souls. Unless the workers appointed by God\ndo the most interested hunting for lost sheep, Satan will succeed in\nhis work of destroying, and souls will be lost that might have been\nfound and restored.\u2014Letter 18, 1898.\nSome Not Reached by the Public Effort\u2014In large cities there\nare certain classes that cannot be reached by public meetings. These\nmust be searched out as the shepherd searches for his lost sheep.\nDiligent, personal effort must be put forth in their behalf.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 364 (1915).\nTo Those Who Will Not Come to the Feast\u2014If they will not\ncome to the gospel feast to which the call of Christ invites them,\nthen God\u2019s messengers must accommodate themselves to the cir-\ncumstances and bear the message to them in house-to-house labor, [434]\nthus extending their ministry to the highways and byways, giving\nthe last message to the world.\u2014Letter 164, 1899.\nEven to the Disinterested\u2014Go to the homes of those even who\nmanifest no interest. While mercy\u2019s sweet voice invites the sinner,\n388 Evangelism\nwork with every energy of heart and brain, as did Paul, \u201cwho ceased\nnot to warn everyone night and day with tears.\u201d In the day of God,\nhow many will confront us, and say, \u201cI am lost! I am lost! And you\nnever warned me; you never entreated me to come to Jesus. Had I\nbelieved as you did, I would have followed every Judgment-bound\nsoul within my reach with prayers and tears and warnings.\u201d\u2014Review\nand Herald, June 24, 1884 .\nCarry God\u2019s Word to Every Man\u2019s Door \u2014The press is an\ninstrumentality by which many are reached whom it would be im-\npossible to reach by ministerial effort. A great work can be done by\npresenting to the people the Bible just as it reads. Carry the Word\nof God to every man\u2019s door, urge its plain statements upon every\nman\u2019s conscience, repeat to all the Saviour\u2019s command, \u201cSearch the\nScriptures.\u201d Admonish them to take the Bible as it is, to implore the\ndivine enlightenment, and then, when the light shines, to gladly ac-\ncept each precious ray, and fearlessly abide the consequences.\u2014.The\nReview and Herald, July 10, 1883.\nGod Will Guide to Homes \u2014Light, light from the Word of\nGod,\u2014this is what the people need. If the teachers of the Word\nare willing, the Lord will lead them into close relation with the\npeople. He will guide them to the homes of those who need and\ndesire the truth; and as the servants of God engage in the work of\nseeking for the lost sheep, their spiritual faculties are awakened and\nenergized. Knowing that they are in harmony with God, they feel[435]\njoyous and happy. Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they obtain\nan experience that is invaluable to them. Their intellectual and moral\npowers attain their highest development; for grace is given in answer\nto the demand.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 29, 1904.\nWinning Families\nTo Pray and Study With Families\u2014While the minds of many\nare stirred and convicted of the truth, the interest should be followed\nup by wise, earnest, and persevering labor.... The call is for men\nwho will go forth imbued with the Spirit of Christ, and work for\nsouls. The minister should not confine his labors to the desk, nor\nshould he settle down in some pleasant home among the brethren.\nHe must watch for souls. He must visit the people at their homes,\nand by personal efforts seek to impress the truth upon hearts and\nconsciences. He must pray with families and hold Bible readings\nwith them. While with tact and wisdom he urges home upon his\nfellow men their duty to obey the Word of God, his daily intercourse\nwith them should reveal whatever in his character is good and pure,\nexcellent and lovely, kind and courteous.\nIn the messages of the first and second angels, the work was\ndone in this manner. Men and women were moved to search the\nScriptures, and they called the attention of others to the truths re-\nvealed. It was personal labor for individuals and families that gave\nthese messages their wonderful success.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJanuary 27, 1885.\nSome Families Reached Only Within Homes\u2014There are fam-\nilies who will never be reached by the truth of God\u2019s Word unless [436]\nHis servants enter their homes, and by earnest ministry, sanctified by\nthe indorsement of the Holy Spirit, break down the barriers. As the\npeople see that these workers are messengers of mercy, the ministers\nof grace, they are ready to listen to the words spoken by them....\nWhen such a worker offers prayer to God in the family where he\nis visiting, the hearts of the members are touched as they would not\nbe by prayer offered in a public assembly. Angels of God enter the\nfamily circle with him; and the minds of the hearers are prepared\nto receive the Word of God: for if the messenger is humble and\ncontrite, if he has a living connection with God, the Holy Spirit takes\nthe Word, and shows it to those for whom he is laboring....\n389\n390 Evangelism\nThe Lord desires that the truth shall come close to the people,\nand this can be accomplished only by personal labor. Much is\ncomprehended in the command, \u201cGo out into the highways and\nhedges, and compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\u201d\nThere is a work to be done in this line that has not yet been done. Let\nGod\u2019s workers teach the truth in families, drawing close to those for\nwhom they labor. If they thus co-operate with God, He will clothe\nthem with spiritual power. Christ will guide them in their work,\nentering the houses of the people with them, and giving them words\nto speak that will sink deep into the hearts of the listeners. The Holy\nSpirit will open hearts and minds to receive the rays coming from the\nsource of all light.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 29, 1904.\nFind the Way to the Heart\u2014To all who are working with Christ\nI would say, Wherever you can gain access to the people by the\nfireside, improve your opportunity. Take your Bible, and open before\nthem its great truths. Your success will not depend so much upon[437]\nyour knowledge and accomplishments, as upon your ability to find\nyour way to the heart. By being social and coming close to the\npeople, you may turn the current of their thoughts more readily than\nby the most able discourse. The presentation of Christ in the family,\nby the fireside, and in small gatherings in private houses, is often\nmore successful in winning souls to Jesus than are sermons delivered\nin the open air, to the moving throng, or even in halls or churches.\nAll who engage in this personal labor should be just as careful\nnot to become mechanical in their manner of working as should\nthe minister who preaches the Word. They should be constantly\nlearning. They should have a conscientious zeal to obtain the high-\nest qualifications, to become men able in the Scriptures.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 193 (1915).\nTwo and Two in Personal Work\u2014There should always be two\nand two of our brethren to go out together, and then as many more\nas they can rally to engage in the work of visiting and seeking to\ninterest families, making personal efforts.\u2014Letter 34, 1886.\nMinister and Wife\u2014Keep on the track of souls. Show tact and\nskill when visiting families. Pray with them and for them. Bear the\ntruth to them in great tenderness and love, and returns will surely\ncome. If the minister and his wife can jointly engage in this work,\nthey should do so.\u2014Letter 18, 1898.\nEvangelistic Visiting\nFollowing Up the Interest\u2014A minister may enjoy sermoniz-\ning; for it is the pleasant part of the work, and is comparatively\neasy; but no minister should be measured by his ability as a speaker. [438]\nThe harder part comes after he leaves the desk, in watering the seed\nsown. The interest awakened should be followed up by personal\nlabor,\u2014visiting, holding Bible readings, teaching how to search the\nScriptures, praying with families and interested ones, seeking to\ndeepen the impression made upon hearts and consciences.\u2014Testi-\nmonies for the Church 5:255 (1885).\nThe Answering of Questions \u2014No minister is sufficiently\nequipped for his work who does not know how to meet the peo-\nple at their homes, and come into close relation to their needs. The\npeople should be allowed to ask questions concerning subjects pre-\nsented that seem to be obscure to them. The light of God is to be\nbrought before their vision. How often when this has been done, and\nthe minister has been able to answer their inquiries, has a flood of\nlight broken into some darkened mind, and hearts have been com-\nforted together in the faith of the gospel. This is the way we are\nto work in order to flash the light into the minds of those who are\nseeking a knowledge of the way of salvation.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, April 19, 1892.\nTraining Follow-up Workers\u2014Some should now be in train-\ning, connected with you, so that if you should be called away to some\nother place, they might continue to exercise a gathering influence.\nLet us pray in regard to this matter. We must pray and work and\nbelieve. The Lord is our efficiency.\u2014Letter 376, 1906.\nEffective Method for Men of Ordinary Talent\u2014Men of ordi-\nnary talents can accomplish more by personal labor from house to\nhouse than by placing themselves in popular places at great expense,\nor by entering halls and trying to call out the crowd. Personal in-\nfluence is a power. The more direct our labor for our fellow men, [439]\nthe greater good will be accomplished.... You must come close to\n391\n392 Evangelism\nthose for whom you labor, that they may not only hear your voice,\nbut shake your hand, learn your principles, and realize your sympa-\nthy.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 8, 1885.\nTeaching Healthful Living by Personal Work\u2014No teacher of\ntruth should feel that his education is completed till he has studied\nthe laws of health and knows the bearing of right practices on the\nspiritual life. He should be qualified to speak to the people intel-\nligently in regard to these things, and to set them an example that\nwill give force to his words. The teaching of correct habits is a part\nof the work of the gospel minister, and the minister will find many\nopportunities of instructing those with whom he comes in contact.\nAs he visits from house to house he should seek to understand the\nneeds of the people, presenting right principles and giving instruction\nas to what is for their best good. To those who have a meager diet he\nshould suggest additions, and to those who live extravagantly, who\nload their tables with unnecessary and hurtful dishes, rich cakes,\npastry, and condiments, he should present the diet that is essential\nfor health and conducive to spirituality.\u2014Letter 19, 1892.\nMinisters Giving Bible Readings\nShort Talks\u2014More Bible Readings\u2014Avoid lengthy sermons.\nThe people cannot retain one half of the discourses which they hear.\nGive short talks and more Bible readings. This is the time to make\nevery point as plain as mileposts.\u2014Letter 102a, 1897.\nNot to Be Shifted to Helpers\u2014We must embrace every oppor-\ntunity to put forth personal labor. The personal labor must be done, [440]\neven if there has to be less preaching done.....\nThis part of the pastoral work is not to be neglected or shifted\nupon your wives or some other person. You must educate and train\nyourselves to visit every family that you can possibly get access to.\nThe results of this work will testify that it is the most profitable work\na gospel minister can do.\nIf he neglects this work, the visiting of the people in their homes,\nhe is an unfaithful shepherd, and the rebuke of God is upon him. His\nwork is not half done. If he had given personal labor, there would\nhave been a large work done and many souls gathered.\nNo excuse will God accept for thus neglecting the most essential\npart of the ministry, which is the proper binding off of the work,\nand binding the messenger bearing the truth up with the flock, the\nsheep, and the lambs of the Lord\u2019s pasture. The Lord Himself makes\nthe human instrument a channel of light to the people, through his\npersonal efforts, in identifying himself with the people for whom he\nis laboring.\nThe weak of the flock need strengthening at the right time\u2014\nwords spoken that will comfort, strengthen, and establish them that\nthey will become rooted, grounded, and established in the faith. This\nis the way and the means God has ordained to meet the people where\nthey are. I recognize in the places where I have thus far labored, the\nvery places which have been lost to the cause of God because the\nmessengers who have brought to them the truth have not ministered\nbecause it was not pleasant business to engage in this work.\u2014Letter\n18, 1893.\n393\n394 Evangelism\nWork Cannot Be Done by Proxy\u2014By personal labor reach the\npeople where they are. Become acquainted with them. This work\ncannot be done by proxy. Money loaned or given cannot accomplish[441]\nit. Sermons from the pulpit cannot do it. Teaching the Scriptures in\nfamilies,\u2014this is the work of an evangelist, and this work is to be\nunited with preaching. If it is omitted, the preaching will be, to a\ngreat extent, a failure.\nThose who are seeking for truth need to have words spoken to\nthem in season; for Satan is speaking to them by his temptations.\nIf you meet with repulse when trying to help souls, heed it not.\nIf there seems to be little good resulting from your work, do not\nbecome discouraged. Keep working; be discreet; know when to\nspeak, and when to keep silent; watch for souls as they that must\ngive an account; and watch for the devices of Satan, lest you be led\naside from duty. Do not allow difficulties to dishearten or intimidate\nyou. With strong faith, with intrepid purpose, meet and overcome\nthese difficulties. Sow the seed in faith, and with an unsparing\nhand.\u2014Gospel Workers, pp. 188, 189. (1915).\nTeach\u2014Hold Bible Readings\u2014You love to preach, and should\nhave a chance to preach wherever you go. You can do a good work\nin this line, but this is not all the work essential to be done\u2014the\npeople need to be taught, to be educated. Many of the sermons given\nwould, if cut short one half, be far more beneficial to the hearers.\nTake time to teach, to hold Bible readings. Get the points and\ntexts fastened in the minds of the hearers. Let them ask questions,\nand answer them in the plainest, simplest manner possible, so that\nthe mind can grasp the truths presented.....\nTeach as Christ taught, study His example, His methods of teach-\ning. He preached few sermons, but wherever He went, crowds gath-\nered to listen to His instruction. The ministers must be educated to[442]\nwork more according to the divine pattern. You have not yet taken\nup the work of educating. The people will listen to sermon after\nsermon, and they can retain but a very few points in the discourse,\nand these lose their force upon the mind; other things come in to\nchoke the seed of truth. Now the Lord\u2019s way is the best way, to im-\npress upon minds, point by point, the truths that are for their eternal\ninterest to know. Let the soil of the heart be prepared and the seed\nso planted that it will spring up and bear fruit.\u2014Letter 29, 1890.\nLearning the Art of Personal Work\nAll Who Can to Do Bible Work \u2014All who can, should do\npersonal labor. As they go from house to house, explaining the\nScriptures to the people in a clear, simple manner, God makes\nthe truth powerful to save. The Saviour blesses those who do this\nwork.\u2014Letter 108, 1901.\nTeaching Doctrine Not Initial Object of Personal Work \u2014\nThere are many souls yearning unutterably for light, for assurance\nand strength beyond what they have been able to grasp. They need\nto be sought out and labored for patiently, perseveringly. Beseech\nthe Lord in fervent prayer for help. Present Jesus because you know\nHim as your personal Saviour. Let His melting love, His rich grace,\nflow forth from human lips. You need not present doctrinal points\nunless questioned. But take the Word, and with tender, yearning\nlove for souls, show them the precious righteousness of Christ, to\nwhom you and they must come to be saved.\u2014Manuscript 27, 1895.\nLearning to Gather the Crop\u2014There is need of education\u2014\nthe training of everyone who shall enter the gospel field, not only [443]\nto use the scythe and mow the crop, but to rake it, to gather it, to\ncare for it properly. This mowing has been done everywhere, and\namounted to very little because there has been so little earnest work\ndone by personal effort to gather the wheat from the chaff and bind\nit in bundles for the garner.\u2014Letter 16e, 1892.\nLearn the Art of Handling the Gospel Net \u2014The mind must\nbe active to invent the best ways and means of reaching the people\nnext us. We should not be far-reaching, incurring great expense.\nThere are individuals and families near us for whom we should\nmake personal efforts. We often let opportunities within our reach\nslip away, in order to do a work at a distance from us which is less\nhopeful, and thus our time and means may be lost in both places. The\nstudy of the workers now should be to learn the trade of gathering\nsouls into the gospel net.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 8,\n1885.\n395\n396 Evangelism\nNatural Simplicity in Soul Winning\u2014The work of Christ was\nlargely composed of personal interviews. He had a faithful regard\nfor the one-soul audience; and that one soul has carried to thousands\nthe intelligence received.\nEducate the youth to help the youth; and in seeking to do this\nwork each will gain experience that will qualify him to become a\nconsecrated worker in a larger sphere. Thousands of hearts can\nbe reached in the most simple way. The most intellectual, those\nwho are looked upon and praised as the world\u2019s great and gifted\nmen and women, are often refreshed by the most humble, simple\nwords spoken by one who loves God, who can speak of that love\nas naturally as worldlings can speak of those things which their\nminds contemplate and feed upon. Words, even if well prepared and[444]\nstudied, have little influence; but the true, honest work of a son or\na daughter of God in words, or in a service of little things, done in\nnatural simplicity, will unbolt the door, which has long been locked,\nto many souls.\u2014.The Review and Herald, May 9, 1899.\nThe Approach\u2014Persuasive, Kindly \u2014Approach the people\nin a persuasive, kindly manner, full of cheerfulness and love for\nChrist..... No human tongue can express the preciousness of the\nministration of the Word and the Holy Spirit. No human expression\ncan portray to the finite mind the value of understanding and by\nliving faith receiving the blessing that is given as Jesus of Nazareth\npasses by.\u2014Letter 60, 1903.\nImportance of Handshake\u2014Much depends upon the manner\nin which you meet those whom you visit. You can take hold of a\nperson\u2019s hand in greeting in such a way as to gain his confidence at\nonce, or in so cold a manner that he will think you have no interest\nin him.\u2014Gospel Workers, 189 (1915).\nYoung Men for City Bible Work\u2014Young men should be in-\nstructed that they may labor in these cities. They may never be able\nto present the truth from the desk, but they could go from house to\nhouse, and point the people to the Lamb of God that taketh away\nthe sin of the world. The dust and rubbish of error have buried the\nprecious jewels of truth; but the Lord\u2019s workers can uncover these\ntreasures, so that many will look upon them with delight and awe.\nThere is a great variety of work, adapted to different minds and\nLearning the Art of Personal Work 397\nvaried capabilities.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of\nthe Seventh-day Adventists, 182 (1886).\nPrejudice Broken Down[445]\nBible Readings and Visitation Prepare for the Effort \u2014The\nwork is to commence quietly without noise or trumpeting. It is to\ncommence by giving Bible readings and thus educating the people.\nThis plan will be far more efficient than starting in with sermons.\u2014\nLetter 89a, 1895.\nOpposition Avoided by Personal Work\u2014In God\u2019s service ob-\nstacles must be met and difficulties encountered. Events belong to\nGod; and His servants must meet with difficulties and opposition;\nfor they are His chosen methods of discipline and His appointed\nconditions of sure progress, advancement, and success. But I entreat\nthe servants of the Lord Jesus to remember that there is a work which\nmay be done quietly, without arousing that strong opposition which\ncloses hearts to the truth.\u2014Letter 95, 1896.\nVisitation Determines Wisdom of Public Effort \u2014I tell you\nin the name of the Lord that with your present force of workers,\nyou are not prepared to engage in work in a hard place where the\nprejudice is strong. If half of the time usually spent in making public\neffort were devoted to house-to-house teaching, till the people had\nbecome acquainted with the religious sincerity of the workers and\nwith the reasons of their faith, it would be much better. After this\nwork has been done, it could be decided whether a more expensive\neffort would be advisable.\nPublic efforts have been made which have accomplished good.\nSome have responded and received the truth, but, oh, how few these\nhave been. The Lord desires that the truth shall come close to the\npeople, and this work can only be accomplished by personal labor.\u2014\nLetter 95, 1896.\nTact Required to Break Down Prejudice \u2014Nathanael was[446]\npraying to know whether this was indeed the Christ of whom Moses\nand the prophets had spoken. While he continued to pray, one of\nthose who had been brought to Christ, Philip by name, called to him\nand said, \u201cWe have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the\n398\nPrejudice Broken Down 399\nprophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.\u201d Notice\nhow quickly prejudice arises. Nathanael says, \u201cCan there any good\nthing come out of Nazareth?\u201d Philip knew the strong prejudice that\nexisted in the minds of many against Nazareth, and he did not try\nto argue with him, for fear of raising his combativeness, but simply\nsaid, \u201cCome and see.\u201d\nHere is a lesson for all our ministers, colporteurs, and missionary\nworkers. When you meet those, who, like Nathanael, are prejudiced\nagainst the truth, do not urge your peculiar views too strongly. Talk\nwith them at first of subjects upon which you can agree. Bow with\nthem in prayer, and in humble faith present your petitions at the\nthrone of grace. Both you and they will be brought into a closer\nconnection with heaven, prejudice will be weakened, and it will\nbe easier to reach the heart.\u2014Historical Sketches of the Foreign\nMissions of the Seventh-day Adventists, 149 (1886).\nWorking for the Aged\nWaiting for the Truth\u2014It is wonderful how many aged people\nthe workers find who need but little labor to lead them to receive\nthe truth, Sabbath and all. Why, they say, this is what we have been\npraying for. We knew that the Scriptures had much to say upon\nsubjects that the clergymen did not and could not explain to us.\nThese do little else but rejoice in the light and in the truth. Their joy[447]\nseems to be full.\u2014Letter 18, 1898.\nLife Begins at Conversion\u2014I have just read the following in-\ncident:\n\u201cAn old man, about seventy or eighty years of age, was once\nbrought to me, as a monument of God\u2019s mercy. I asked him how old\nhe was. He looked at me for a little while, and then said in faltering\ntones, while the tears ran down his cheeks, \u2018I am two years old.\u2019 I\nexpressed my surprise, and then he said, \u2018Ah, until two years ago I\nlived the life of a dead man. I never knew what it was to live until I\nmet with the life that is hid with Christ in God.\u2019\u201d\u2014Letter 160, 1903.\n400\nEllen G. White\u2019s Experience and Methods as a\nPersonal Worker\nAn Early Experience\u2014The reality of true conversion seemed\nso plain to me that I felt like helping my young friends into the light,\nand at every opportunity exerted my influence toward this end.\nI arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were\nconsiderably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A\nnumber of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded\nto them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I\ndetermined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls,\nfor whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire\nnights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had\nsought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and\npraying with them.\nSome of these had met with us from curiosity to hear what I had\nto say; others thought me beside myself to be so persistent in my [448]\nefforts, especially when they manifested no concern on their own\npart. But at every one of our little meetings I continued to exhort and\npray for each one separately, until every one had yielded to Jesus,\nacknowledging the merits of His pardoning love. Every one was\nconverted to God.\nNight after night in my dreams I seemed to be laboring for the\nsalvation of souls. At such times special cases were presented to\nmy mind; these I afterward sought out and prayed with. In every\ninstance but one these persons yielded themselves to the Lord.\u2014Life\nSketches, 41, 42(1915).\nTwenty-two Years After the Seed Sowing\u2014After the meeting\nclosed [a service at the Michigan camp meeting], a sister took me\nheartily by the hand, expressing great joy at meeting Sister White\nagain. She inquired if I remembered calling at a log house in the\nwoods twenty-two years before. She gave us refreshments and I left\nwith them a little book, Experience and Views.\n401\n402 Evangelism\nShe stated that she had lent that little book to her neighbors,\nas new families had settled around her, until there was very little\nleft of it; and she expressed a great desire to obtain another copy\nof the work. Her neighbors were deeply interested in it, and were\ndesirous of seeing the writer. She said that when I called upon her I\ntalked to her of Jesus and the beauties of heaven, and that the words\nwere spoken with such fervor that she was charmed, and had never\nforgotten them. Since that time the Lord had sent ministers to preach\nthe truth to them, and now there was quite a company observing\nthe Sabbath. The influence of that little book, now worn out with\nperusing, had extended from one another, performing its silent work,\nuntil the soil was ready for the seeds of truth.\nI well remember the long journey we took twenty-two years ago,[449]\nin Michigan. We were on our way to hold a meeting in Vergennes.\nWe were fifteen miles from our destination. Our driver had passed\nover the road repeatedly and was well acquainted with it, but was\ncompelled to acknowledge that he had lost the way. We traveled\nforty miles that day, through the woods, over logs and fallen trees,\nwhere there was scarcely a trace of road....\nWe could not understand why we should be left to this singular\nwandering in the wilderness. We were never more pleased than when\nwe came in sight of a little clearing on which was a log cabin, where\nwe found the sister I have mentioned. She kindly welcomed us to\nher home, and provided us with refreshments, which were gratefully\nreceived. As we rested, I talked with the family and left them the\nlittle book. She gladly accepted it, and has preserved it until the\npresent time.\nFor twenty-two years our wanderings on this journey have\nseemed indeed mysterious to us, but here we met quite a com-\npany who are now believers in the truth, and who date their first\nexperience from the influence of that little book. The sister who so\nkindly administered to our wants is now, with many of her neigh-\nbors, rejoicing in the light of present truth.\u2014The Signs of the Times,\nOctober 19, 1876.\nAn Experience in Nimes, France\u2014When laboring in Nimes,\nFrance, we made it our work to save souls. There was a young\nman who had become discouraged through the temptations of Satan\nand through some mistakes of our brethren who did not understand\nEllen G. White\u2019s Experience and Methods as a Personal Worker 403\nhow to deal with the minds of the youth. He gave up the Sabbath\nand engaged to work in a manufacturing establishment to perfect\nhis trade in watchmaking. He is a very promising young man. My [450]\nwatch needed repairing, which brought us together.\nI was introduced to him, and as soon as I looked upon his coun-\ntenance I knew that he was the one whom the Lord had presented\nbefore me in vision. The whole circumstance came distinctly before\nme....\nHe attended the meeting when he thought I would speak, and\nwould sit with his eyes riveted on me through the entire discourse,\nwhich was translated into French by Brother Bourdeau. I felt a duty\nto labor for this young man. I talked two hours with him and urged\nupon him the peril of his situation. I told him because his brethren\nhad made a mistake that was no reason that he should grieve the\nheart of Christ, who had loved him so much that He had died to\nredeem him....\nI told him I knew the history of his life and his errors (which\nwere the simple errors of youthful indiscretion), which were not of a\ncharacter that should have been treated with so great severity. I then\nentreated him with tears to turn square about, to leave the service\nof Satan and of sin, for he had become a thorough backslider, and\nreturn like the prodigal to his Father\u2019s house, his Father\u2019s service.\nHe was in good business learning his trade. If he kept the Sabbath\nhe would lose his position.... A few months more would finish his\napprenticeship, and then he would have a good trade. But I urged an\nimmediate decision.\nWe prayed with him most earnestly, and I told him that I dared\nnot have him cross the threshold of the door until he would before\nGod and angels and those present say, \u201cI will from this day be a\nChristian.\u201d How my heart rejoiced when he said this. He slept none\nthat night. He said as soon as he made the promise he seemed to [451]\nbe in a new channel. His thoughts seemed purified, his purposes\nchanged, and the responsibility that he had taken seemed so solemn\nthat he could not sleep. The next day he notified his employer that\nhe could work for him no longer. He slept but little for three nights.\nHe was happy, so thankful that the Lord had evidenced to him His\npardon and His love.\u2014Letter 59, 1886.\n404 Evangelism\nAn Effective Use of Literature \u2014There was one man whom,\nwith his whole family, we highly prized. He is a reading man, and\nhas a large farm, on which grow the choicest of oranges and lemons,\nwith other fruit. But he did not in the beginning fully take his position\nfor the truth, and went back. They told me about this. In the night\nseason the angel of the Lord seemed to stand by me, saying, \u201cGo to\nBrother _____, place your books before him, and this will save his\nsoul.\u201d I visited with him, taking with me a few of my large books.\nI talked with him just as though he were with us. I talked of his\nresponsibilities. I said, \u201cYou have great responsibilities, my brother.\nHere are your neighbors all around you. You are accountable for\nevery one of them. You have a knowledge of the truth, and if you\nlove the truth, and stand in your integrity, you will win souls for\nChrist.\u201d\nHe looked at me in a queer way, as much as to say, \u201cI do not\nthink you know that I have given up the truth, that I have allowed\nmy girls to go to dances, and to the Sunday school, that we do not\nkeep the Sabbath.\u201d But I did know it. However, I talked to him just\nas though he were with us. \u201cNow,\u201d I said, \u201cwe are going to help\nyou to begin to work for your neighbors. I want to make you a\npresent of some books.\u201d He said, \u201cWe have a library, from which we\ndraw books.\u201d I said, \u201cI do not see any books here. Perhaps you feel[452]\ndelicate about drawing from the library. I have come to give you\nthese books, so that your children can read them, and this will be a\nstrength to you.\u201d I knelt down and prayed with him, and when we\nrose, the tears were rolling down his face, as he said, \u201cI am glad that\nyou came to see me. I thank you for the books.\u201d\nThe next time I visited him, he told me that he had read part of\nPatriarchs and Prophets. He said, \u201cThere is not one syllable I could\nchange. Every paragraph speaks right to the soul.\u201d\nI asked Brother _____ which of my large books he considered\nthe most important. He said, \u201cI lend them all to my neighbors, and\nthe hotelkeeper thinks that Great Controversy is the best. But,\u201d he\nsaid, while his lips quivered, \u201cI think that Patriarchs and Prophets\nis the best. It is that which pulled me out of the mire.\u201d\nBut suffice it to say, he took his position firmly for the truth.\nHis whole family united with him, and they have been the means of\nEllen G. White\u2019s Experience and Methods as a Personal Worker 405\nsaving other families.\u2014.The General Conference Bulletin, April 5,\n1901.\nChatting With a New Believer About the Work \u2014A woman\nabout forty years of age was introduced to me, who has just decided\nto obey the truth, in Canterbury. Her husband is in full sympathy\nwith his wife and does everything he can to get her to the meetings.\nThey have a nice little cottage, which they own and which is paid\nfor. She came out to the carriage and talked with us. She said the\npeople in Canterbury are not a churchgoing people, but the tent at\n_____ has been an advertisement, and they are curious to know what\nit all means. In this way they are brought out to attend the meetings,\nand many are interested. You cannot get them into a church or a [453]\nhall, but the tent they will patronize....\nThe sister mentioned, who talked with me at the carriage, said,\n\u201cThese precious things of the Bible are wonderful to me. Strange\nwe could not see them before. The Bible is full of riches, and I want\nto have all the opportunity to hear and improve, so that I can help\nothers. People here in Canterbury are in need of this kind of labor.\nIf you will pitch the tent, they will come.\u201d\u2014Letter 89a, 1895.\nLeaves From the Diary of 1892 \u2014October 26 . We had\npromised to visit Brother and Sister H, and after dinner today Elder\nDaniells, May Walling, and I went to fill the appointment. Through\nthe temptations of the enemy, Sister H has given up the truth.... After\na short conversation we all bowed in prayer, and the Lord breathed\nupon us His Holy Spirit. We felt the presence of God, and we greatly\nhope that this effort shall not be in vain.\nNovember 5. It has been a pleasant day, but I have been almost\nstrengthless. We attended meeting, and invited our next-door neigh-\nbor to go with us. She readily consented to go and seemed much\naffected. She talked freely as we drove to the meeting place, but\non our return she looked very solemn and said nothing. I spoke on\nthe parable of the man without a wedding garment, and we had a\nsolemn meeting. The lady afterward told my niece, May Walling,\nthat she was sorry that she had not attended all the meetings that\nhave been held since we came. She declared that she would not miss\none while we remained.\nNovember 6. We had planned to drive into the mountains, ... but\nI had a burden of soul for Brother and Sister H, and felt that I could\n406 Evangelism\nnot go into the mountains and delay the Lord\u2019s business. With very\nimperfect directions May Walling and I started out to find Brother[454]\nH\u2019s place.... At last we were successful. I told Brother and Sister\nH that I had come to talk with them. We began talking at half past\ntwo, and continued until five.... I tried to do all in my power to help\nSister H. She wept nearly all the time that we were talking. I think\nthe Spirit of the Lord touched her heart. I prayed with them and then\nleft them in the hands of God.\nNovember 7. I rested well through the night. At half past four\nI arose and began writing. At ten o\u2019clock, May Walling and I rode\nout to visit Sister E.\nNovember 8. I slept well through the night. During the day I\ndrove to the house where Sister F is boarding with her children. We\ntook her out to ride with us, and had a long talk with her. She is a\nwoman who has seen great trouble.\nNovember 9. In response to an earnest invitation, we drove out\nto a pleasant grove, where the parents and children of the Sabbath\nschool were having a picnic.... I spoke for about half an hour. A\nnumber of unbelievers were present.\nNovember 10. I wrote till noon, and after dinner we drove to\nBourdon, to fill an appointment to meet with some sisters there. We\nhad a very precious season of prayer, believing Christ\u2019s promise that\nwhere two or three meet together in His name, He meets with them\nto bless them. I read some important matter to those present, and\ntalked with them. I labored harder than when I speak on the Sabbath;\nfor I was with them for nearly two hours. It was almost dark when\nwe reached home; but I was blessed of the Lord, and we were happy\nin His love.\nNovember 11. I fear that I have been doing too much. Since\nSabbath I have written eighty-six pages, letter paper, besides making[455]\nseveral visits to people in their homes. This afternoon I called at\nBrother and Sister H\u2019s and left some books.\nNovember 21. At two o\u2019clock today I visited Brother and Sister\nH and read some things that I had been writing to meet the difficulties\nexisting in Sister H\u2019s mind.\nNovember 27. Today I visited Sister K and her daughter. The\ndaughter recently met with an accident.... We talked and prayed with\nEllen G. White\u2019s Experience and Methods as a Personal Worker 407\nher, and the Lord drew very near as we entreated Him to bless both\nmother and daughter.\nWe next visited Sister G, who is a widow.... We had a season\nof prayer with this sister, and the tender Spirit of the Lord rested\nupon us. We talked with Sister G\u2019s daughter, a girl of about sixteen,\ntelling her of the love of Jesus and entreating her to give her heart to\nthe Saviour. I told her that if she would accept Christ as her Saviour,\nHe would be her support in every trial and would give her peace and\nrest in His love. She seemed to be influenced by our words. We then\nwent to see Brother and Sister H.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1892.\nFields Endeared to the Worker\u2014Dora Ceek and Martinsville\nand the other settlements in the woods in which we labored are dear\nto me. I hope that the most tender solicitude will be shown for the\nsouls in these places and that earnest efforts will be made to draw\nthem to Christ. Much has been done in these places, and much more\nwill need to be done.\u2014Letter 113, 1902.\n408 Evangelism\nSection 14\u2014The Bible Instructor [456]\n[Note: \u201cBible Instructor\u201d is the term adopted in 1942 by the\nGeneral Conference Committee, to designate the personal worker\nformerly known as \u201cBible Worker.\u201d\u2014Compilers.]\nBible Teaching the Objective\nNeed of a Bible-Study Revival \u2014A revival in Bible study is\nneeded throughout the world. Attention is to be called, not to the\nassertions of men, but to the Word of God. As this is done, a mighty\nwork will be wrought. When God declared that His Word should not\nreturn unto Him void, He meant all that He said. The gospel is to be\npreached to all nations. The Bible is to be opened to the people. A\nknowledge of God is the highest education, and it will cover the earth\nwith its wonderful truth as the waters cover the sea.\u2014Manuscript\n139, 1898.\nBible Work Marked Out by Heavenly Father\u2014Our work has\nbeen marked out for us by our heavenly Father. We are to take our\nBibles, and go forth to warn the world. We are to be God\u2019s helping\nhands in saving souls\u2014channels through which His love is day by\nday to flow to the perishing.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:150\n(1909).\nA Heaven-born Method\u2014The plan of holding Bible readings\nwas a heaven-born idea. There are many, both men and women, who\ncan engage in this branch of missionary labor. Workers may thus\nbe developed who will become mighty men of God. By this means\nthe Word of God has been given to thousands; and the workers are[457]\nbrought into personal contact with people of all nations and tongues.\nThe Bible is brought into families, and its sacred truths come home\nto the conscience. Men are entreated to read, examine, and judge for\nthemselves, and they must abide the responsibility of receiving or\nrejecting the divine enlightenment. God will not permit this precious\nwork for Him to go unrewarded. He will crown with success every\nhumble effort made in His name.\u2014Gospel Workers, 192 (1915).\nBible Work a Thorough Method\u2014In every city that is entered,\na solid foundation is to be laid for permanent work. The Lord\u2019s\nmethods are to be followed. By doing house-to-house work, by\ngiving Bible readings in families, the worker may gain access to\nmany who are seeking for truth. By opening the Scriptures, by\n410\nBible Teaching the Objective 411\nprayer, by exercising faith, he is to teach the people the way of the\nLord.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:38 (1902).\nIn Some Places Bible Work Better Than Public Effort \u2014I\nwas once shown a place in which a tent effort had been made. Great\npreparations were made, and the expense entailed was large. Enough\nwas done to awaken the whole community, and in one sense it\nwas awakened; but it was to warn of the dangerous errors held by\nthose who were preaching the truth. An alarm was sounded, and\nfalsehoods were repeated again and again. The stay-away argument\nwas urged with much effect. The laborers were disappointed with\ntheir efforts, for only a few came to hear, and very few decided to\nobey the truth.\nI was shown this same place at another time. I saw two Bible\nworkers seated in a family. With the open Bibles before them,\nthey presented the Lord Jesus Christ as the sin-pardoning Saviour. [458]\nTheir words were spoken with freshness and power. Earnest prayer\nwas offered to God, and hearts were softened and subdued by the\nsoftening influence of the Spirit of God. As the Word of God was\nexplained, I saw that a soft, radiant light illuminated the Scriptures,\nand I said softly, \u201cGo out into the highways and hedges, and compel\nthem to come in, that my house may be filled.\u201d\nThese workers were not boastful but humble and contrite in\nheart, realizing always that the Holy Spirit was their efficiency.\nUnder its divine influence, indifference was dispelled, and an earnest\ninterest was manifested. The precious light was communicated from\nneighbor to neighbor. Family altars which had been broken down\nwere again erected, and many were converted to the truth.\u2014Letter\n95, 1896.\nExplaining the Word\u2014Right where you are, right where the\npeople are, let earnest effort be put forth. The Word of God has been,\nas it were, hid under a bushel. That Word must be explained to those\nwho are now in ignorance of its requirements. Search the Scriptures\nwith those who are willing to be taught. The work may be small in\nits beginning, but others will unite to carry it forward; and as in faith\nand dependence on God earnest labor is put forth to enlighten and\ninstruct the people in the simple truths of the Word, those who listen\nwill catch the meaning of true discipleship.\u2014Letter 30, 1911.\nPersonal Workers and Wise Counselors\nOur Example Affects Our Counsel\u2014When a crisis comes in\nthe life of any soul, and you attempt to give counsel or admonition,\nyour words will have only the weight of influence for good that your[459]\nown example and spirit have gained for you. You must be good\nbefore you can do good. You cannot exert an influence that will\ntransform others until your own heart has been humbled and refined\nand made tender by the grace of Christ. When this change has been\nwrought in you, it will be as natural for you to live to bless others as\nit is for the rosebush to yield its fragrant bloom or the vine its purple\nclusters.\u2014Mount of Blessing, p. 183. (1896).\nPersonal Ministry in Bible Work \u2014There is need of coming\nclose to the people by personal effort. If less time were given to\nsermonizing, and more time were spent in personal ministry, greater\nresults would be seen. The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for,\nthe sorrowing and the bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed,\nthe inexperienced counseled. We are to weep with those that weep,\nand rejoice with those that rejoice. Accompanied by the power of\npersuasion, the power of prayer, the power of the love of God, this\nwork will not, cannot, be without fruit.\u2014The Ministry of Healing,\n143, 144 (1905).\nWomen as Messengers of Mercy \u2014We greatly need conse-\ncrated women who, as messengers of mercy, shall visit the mothers\nand the children in their homes, and help them in the everyday house-\nhold duties, if need be, before beginning to talk to them regarding\nthe truth for this time. You will find that by this method you will\nhave souls as the result of your ministry.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nJuly 12, 1906.\nReaching Hearts by Interest in the Sick \u2014My brethren and\nsisters, give yourselves to the Lord for service. Allow no opportunity\nto pass unimproved. Visit the sick and suffering, and show a kindly\ninterest in them. If possible, do something to make them more\ncomfortable. Through this means you can reach their hearts, and[460]\n412\nPersonal Workers and Wise Counselors 413\nspeak a word for Christ.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:36 (1909).\nBeing a Friend to the Family \u2014The sisters can do much to\nreach the heart and make it tender. Wherever you are, my sisters,\nwork in simplicity. If you are in a home where there are children,\nshow an interest in them. Let them see that you love them. If one is\nsick, offer to give him treatment; help the careworn, anxious mother\nto relieve her suffering child.\u2014The Review and Herald, November\n11, 1902.\nPeople Saved as Individuals, Not in Masses \u2014Salt must be\nmingled with the substance to which it is added; it must penetrate\nand infuse in order to preserve. So it is through personal contact\nand association that men are reached by the saving power of the\ngospel. They are not saved in masses, but as individuals. Personal\ninfluence is a power. We must come close to those whom we desire\nto benefit.\u2014Mount of Blessing, p. 59. (1896).\nNeed for Women Counselors\u2014If any woman, no matter who,\ncasts herself upon your sympathy, [Addressed to a Conference Pres-\nident.\u2014Compilers.] are you to take her up and encourage her and\nreceive letters from her and feel a special responsibility to help her?\nMy brother, you should change your course with regard to such\nmatters, and set a right example before your brother ministers. Keep\nyour sympathy for the members of your own family, who need all\nthat you can give them.\nWhen a woman is in trouble, let her take her trouble to women. If\nthis woman who has come to you has cause of complaint against her\nhusband, she should take her trouble to some other woman who can,\nif necessary, talk with you in regard to it, without any appearance of [461]\nevil.\nYou do not seem to realize that your course in this matter is\nexerting a wrong influence. Be guarded in your words and actions.\u2014\nLetter 164, 1902.\nA Grand Work in Which Heaven Unites\u2014The work you are\ndoing [Addressed to a woman of broad public experience who had\njoined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.\u2014Compilers.] To help our\nsisters feel their individual accountability to God is a good and nec-\nessary work. Long has it been neglected. But when this work is laid\nout in clear, simple, definite lines, we may expect that home duties,\ninstead of being neglected, will be done much more intelligently.\n414 Evangelism\nThe lord would have us ever to urge the worth of the human soul\nupon those who do not understand its value.\nIf we can arrange to have regular, organized companies instructed\nintelligently in regard to the part they should act as servants of the\nMaster, our churches will have a life and vitality that they have long\nneeded. The excellency of the soul Christ has saved will be appre-\nciated. Our sisters generally have a hard time with their increasing\nfamilies and their unappreciated trials. I have so longed for women\nwho could be educated to help our sisters rise from their discour-\nagement and feel that they could do a work for the Lord. This is\nbringing rays of sunshine into their own lives, which are reflected\ninto the hearts of others. God will bless you and all who unite with\nyou in this grand work.\u2014Letter 54, 1899.\nSearching for the Lost\nBible Carried to Every Man\u2019s Door\u2014The Bible is unchained.\nIt can be carried to every man\u2019s door, and its truths may be presented [462]\nto every man\u2019s conscience. There are many who, like the noble\nBereans, will search the Scriptures daily for themselves, when the\ntruth is presented, to see whether or not these things are so. Christ has\nsaid, \u201cSearch the Scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life,\nand they are they which testify of Me.\u201d Jesus, the world\u2019s Redeemer,\nbids men not only to read but to \u201csearch the Scriptures.\u201d This is a\ngreat and important work, and it is committed to us, and in doing this\nwe shall be greatly benefited; for obedience to Christ\u2019s command\nwill not go unrewarded. He will crown with especial tokens of\nHis favor this act of loyalty in following the light revealed in His\nWord.\u2014Counsels on Sabbath School Work, 84 (1889).\nMany Waiting to Be Gathered In \u2014All over the world men\nand women are looking wistfully to heaven. Prayers and tears and\ninquiries go up from souls longing for light, for grace, for the Holy\nSpirit. Many are on the verge of the kingdom, waiting only to be\ngathered in.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles, 109 (1911).\nSearching for the Lost\u2014This work is to be a determined work.\nThe lost sheep are all through the country where you are. You are to\nseek and to save that which is lost. They know not how to recover\nthemselves.\u2014Letter 189, 1899.\nFinding Openings for Studies \u2014In every city that is entered,\na solid foundation is to be laid for permanent work. The Lord\u2019s\nmethods are to be followed. By doing house-to-house work, by\ngiving Bible readings in families, the worker may gain access to\nmany who are seeking for truth. By opening the Scriptures, by\nprayer, by exercising faith, he is to teach the people the way of the\nLord.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:38 (1902).\nSeeking Out the Honest Souls\u2014I must do my best in bearing [463]\nto our people the message that the Lord has honest souls in all our\ncities, and that they must be sought out. The Lord is not pleased\n415\n416 Evangelism\nwith the showing we have made. Many cities still remain practically\nuntouched. Those who engage in the work of warning the inhabitants\nof our great cities, will obtain an education in winning souls to\nChrist.... How shall they be converted unless they have truth set\nbefore them diligently, line upon line, precept upon precept? ...\nThe workers must not spend their time in going over and over the\nground among churches that are already confirmed in the truth, while\non every hand are many who have never had the truth explained to\nthem.\u2014Letter 8, 1909.\nWorker Guided to Homes of Interested \u2014Light, light from\nthe Word of God,\u2014this is what the people need. If the teachers of\nthe Word are willing, the Lord will lead them into close relation with\nthe people. He will guide them to the homes of those who need and\ndesire the truth; and as the servants of God engage in the work of\nseeking for the lost sheep, their spiritual faculties are awakened and\nenergized.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 29, 1904.\nWith Tenfold More Force \u2014If half the time now spent in\npreaching, were given to house-to-house labor, favorable results\nwould be seen. Much good would be accomplished, for the workers\ncould come close to the people. The time spent in quietly visit-\ning families, and when there speaking to God in prayer, singing His\npraise, and explaining His Word, will often do more good than a pub-\nlic effort. Many times minds are impressed with tenfold more force\nby personal appeals than by any other kind of labor. The family that[464]\nis visited in this way is spoken to personally. The members are not\nin a promiscuous assembly where they can apply to their neighbors\nthe truths which they hear. They themselves are spoken to, earnestly,\nand with a kindhearted solicitude. They are allowed to express their\nobjections freely, and these objections can each be met with a \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord.\u201d If this work is done in humility, by those whose\nhearts are imbued with the love of God, the words are fulfilled, \u201cThe\nentrance of Thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding to the\nsimple.\u201d\u2014Letter 95, 1896.\nSome Seem Unapproachable\u2014Those who work for God will\nfind some people unapproachable. They appear to be offended that\nyou should invade the privacy of their faith and devotion, and do\nnot look graciously upon those who are workers together with God.\nSearching for the Lost 417\nThese workers must look away from self to Jesus, giving careful\nattention to the directions found in His Word.\u2014Letter 5, 1896.\nWomen in Evangelism\nIn This Time of Crisis \u2014The Lord has a work for women as\nwell as for men. They may take their places in His work at this\ncrisis, and He will work through them. If they are imbued with a\nsense of their duty, and labor under the influence of the Holy Spirit,\nthey will have just the self-possession required for this time. The\nSaviour will reflect upon these self-sacrificing women the light of\nHis countenance, and will give them a power that exceeds that of\nmen. They can do in families a work that men cannot do, a work that\nreaches the inner life. They can come close to the hearts of those[465]\nwhom men cannot reach. Their labor is needed.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, August 26, 1902.\nWomen With Work at Heart\u2014Women who have the cause of\nGod at heart can do a good work in the districts in which they reside.\nChrist speaks of women who helped Him in presenting the truth\nbefore others, and Paul also speaks of women who labored with him\nin the gospel. But how very limited is the work done by those who\ncould do a large work if they would.\u2014Letter 31, 1894.\nWhen Believing Women Feel the Burden of Souls \u2014I have\nthought, with your experience, under the supervision of God you\ncould exert your influence to set in operation lines of work where\nwomen could unite together to work for the Lord. There certainly\nshould be a larger number of women engaged in the work of min-\nistering to suffering humanity, uplifting, educating them how to\nbelieve\u2014simply to believe\u2014in Jesus Christ our Saviour. And as\nsouls give themselves to the Lord Jesus, making an entire surrender,\nthey will understand the doctrine....\nI am pained because our sisters in America are not more of them\ndoing the work they might do for the Lord Jesus. Abiding in Christ,\nthey would receive courage and strength and faith for the work.\nMany women love to talk. Why can\u2019t they talk the words of Christ to\nperishing souls? The more closely we are related to Christ, the heart\nlearns the wretchedness of souls that do not know God, and who do\n418\nWomen in Evangelism 419\nnot feel the dishonor they are doing to Christ who has bought them\nwith a price.\nWhen the believing women shall feel the burden of souls, and\nburden of sins not their own, they will be working as Christ worked.\nThey will consider no sacrifice too great to make to win souls to [466]\nChrist. And everyone who has this love for souls, is born of God;\nthey are ready to follow in His footsteps, and their words and voice\nwould be talents employed in the Master\u2019s service; the very nourish-\nment coming from the parent stock to their own souls would flow\nout in distinct channels of love to souls who are withered and dried\nup.\nIn this work is a constant education. The desire to be a blessing\ndiscovers the weakness and inefficiency of the worker. This drives\nthe soul to God in prayer, and the Lord Jesus gives light and His Holy\nSpirit, and they understand that it is Christ who does the melting and\nbreaking of the hard hearts.\u2014Letter 133, 1898.\nNeeded in Various Branches of the Work \u2014In the various\nbranches of the work of God\u2019s cause, there is a wide field in which\nour sisters may do good service for the Master. Many lines of mis-\nsionary work are neglected. In the different churches, much work\nwhich is often left undone or done imperfectly, could be well accom-\nplished by the help that our sisters, if properly instructed, can give.\nThrough various lines of home missionary effort they can reach a\nclass that is not reached by our ministers. Among the noble women\nwho have had the moral courage to decide in favor of the truth for\nthis time are many who have tact, perception, and good ability, and\nwho may make successful workers. The labors of such Christian\nwomen are needed.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 10, 1914.\nWomen\u2019s Part in Evangelism\u2014In the various lines of home\nmissionary work, the modest, intelligent woman may use her powers\nto the very highest account. Who can have so deep a love for the\nsouls of men and women for whom Christ has died as those who are [467]\npartakers of His grace? Who can represent the truth and the example\nof Christ better than Christian women who themselves are practicing\nthe truth?\u2014The Review and Herald, December 10, 1914.\nAs Counselor, Companion, and Co-Worker\u2014Woman, if she\nwisely improves her time and her faculties, relying upon God for\nwisdom and strength, may stand on an equality with her husband as\n420 Evangelism\nadviser, counselor, companion, and co-worker, and yet lose none of\nher womanly grace or modesty. She may elevate her own character,\nand just as she does this she is elevating and ennobling the char-\nacters of her family, and exerting a powerful though unconscious\ninfluence upon others around her. Why should not women cultivate\nthe intellect? Why should they not answer the purpose of God in\ntheir existence? Why may they not understand their own powers,\nand realizing that these powers are given of God, strive to make use\nof them to the fullest extent in doing good to others, in advancing\nthe work of reform, of truth and real goodness in the world? Satan\nknows that women have a power of influence for good or for evil;\ntherefore he seeks to enlist them in his cause.\u2014Good Health, June,\n1880.\nThe Power of a Consistent Life\u2014Wonderful is the mission of\nthe wives and mothers and the younger women workers. If they will,\nthey can exert an influence for good to all around them. By modesty\nin dress and circumspect deportment, they may bear witness to the\ntruth in its simplicity. They may let their light so shine before all, that\nothers will see their good works and glorify their Father which is in\nheaven. A truly converted woman will exert a powerful transforming\ninfluence for good. Connected with her husband, she may aid him in[468]\nhis work, and become the means of encouragement and blessing to\nhim. When the will and way are brought into subjection to the Spirit\nof God, there is no limit to the good that can be accomplished.\u2014\nManuscript 91, 1908.\nBurden Bearers for Jesus\u2014Our sisters, the youth, the middle-\naged, and those of advanced years, may act a part in the closing\nwork for this time; and in doing this as they have opportunity, they\nwill obtain an experience of the highest value to themselves. In\nforgetfulness of self, they will grow in grace. By training the mind\nin this direction, they will learn how to bear burdens for Jesus.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, January 2, 1879.\nThose Who Work at Home \u2014Those who employ men or\nwomen to assist in the work of the home should give them a just\nwage. And they should give them also a just appreciation. Do not\nlet them think that their faithfulness in service is not appreciated.\nTheir work is just as essential as is the work of those who give Bible\nreadings, and they should receive words of appreciation. They of-\nWomen in Evangelism 421\nten hunger for compassion and sympathy, and this should not be\nwithheld from them, for they deserve it.\nThose who do the cooking and the other work of the home are as\nverily engaged in the service of God as are those engaged in Bible\nwork. And they are in greater need of sympathy and compassion; for\nthere is in spiritual lines of work that which keeps the spirits cheered,\nuplifted, and comforted. And remember, we are all servants. The\none who does your housework is no less highly regarded by the Lord\nthan the one whose work is to give Bible readings.\u2014Manuscript\n128, 1905.\nBoth Men and Women Called to Bible Work[469]\nCombine Talents for a Decisive Work\u2014When a great and de-\ncisive work is to be done, God chooses men and women to do this\nwork, and it will feel the loss if the talents of both are not com-\nbined.\u2014Letter 77, 1898.\nWomen as well as men can engage in the work of hiding the\ntruth where it can work out and be made manifest.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 9:128 (1909).\nSome Women Adapted to Bible Work \u2014There are women\nwho are especially adapted for the work of giving Bible readings,\nand they are very successful in presenting the Word of God in its\nsimplicity to others. They become a great blessing in reaching moth-\ners and their daughters. This is a sacred work, and those engaged in\nit should receive encouragement.\u2014Letter 108, 1910.\nColored Women Called to the Work \u2014Of late, as the needs\nof this field have been pressed upon me. I have been able to sleep\nbut little. Medical missionary work must be carried on among this\n[the colored] people, who must be given a training in nursing, cook-\ning, and in other important lines of work. There are those among\nthem who must be trained to labor as teachers, Bible workers, and\ncanvassers.\u2014Letter 221, 1904.\nTrained Colored Men\u2014Colored men are to be thoroughly ed-\nucated and trained to give Bible readings and hold tent meetings\namong their own people. There are many having capability, who\nshould be prepared for this work.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n9:207 (1909).\nBible Studies by Men of Spiritual Understanding \u2014Hearts[470]\nhave been impressed, and souls converted, as you have presented the\ngrand, testing truths of the Bible, the truths of the grace of Christ.\nThere should now be connected with you in your labors, men of\nspiritual understanding, who will co-operate with you, who will in\nthe daytime conduct Bible studies with the new converts, telling\nthem how to yield to the power of the Holy Spirit, that these souls\n422\nBoth Men and Women Called to Bible Work 423\nmay be fully and firmly established in the truth. They need personal\ninstruction upon many matters.\u2014Letter 376, 1906.\nTraining Men and Women for Bible Work\u2014Elder and Mrs.\nHaskell were conducting Bible studies in the forenoons, and in the\nafternoons the workers in training were going out and visiting from\nhouse to house. These missionary visits, and the sale of many books\nand periodicals, opened the way for the holding of Bible readings.\nAbout forty men and women were attending the morning classes,\nand a goodly number of these students engaged in the afternoon\nwork.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 29, 1906.\nThe Gospel Visitor\nBoth Bible Instructors and Visitors \u2014There are those who\nhave some experience who should, with every effort they make\nin dying churches as well as in new places, select young men or\nmen of mature age to assist in the work. Thus they will be obtaining\nknowledge by interesting themselves in personal effort, and scores of\nhelpers will be fitting for usefulness as Bible readers, as canvassers,\nand as visitors in the families.\u2014Letter 34, 1886.\nYouth Called as Gospel Visitors \u2014There are many lines in[471]\nwhich the youth can find opportunity for helpful effort. Companies\nshould be organized and thoroughly educated to work as nurses,\ngospel visitors, and Bible readers, as canvassers, ministers, and\nmedical missionary evangelists.\u2014Counsels to Parents, Teachers,\nand Students, 546 (1913).\nWomen to Do Visiting\u2014Women may accomplish a good work\nfor God if they will first learn the precious, all-important lesson\nof meekness in the school of Christ. They will be able to benefit\nhumanity by presenting to them the all-sufficiency of Jesus....\nMany who are entrusted with some humble line of work to do for\nthe Master, soon become dissatisfied, and think that they should be\nteachers and leaders. They want to leave their humble ministering,\nwhich is just as important in its place as the larger responsibilities.\nThose who are set to do visiting, soon come to think that anyone\ncan do that work, that anyone can speak words of sympathy and\nencouragement, and lead men in a humble, quiet way to a correct un-\nderstanding of the Scriptures. But it is a work which demands much\ngrace, much patience, and an ever-increasing stock of wisdom....\nNo work done for the Master must be considered inferior and of\nlittle account.... If it is done cheerfully, humbly, and in the meekness\nof Christ, it will result in the glory of God.\u2014Letter 88, 1895.\n424\nWomen in Public Ministry\nThe Effectiveness of Women\u2019s Work\u2014Women can be the in-\nstruments of righteousness, rendering holy service. It was Mary that\nfirst preached a risen Jesus.... If there were twenty women where\nnow there is one, who would make this holy mission their cherished [472]\nwork, we should see many more converted to the truth. The refining,\nsoftening influence of Christian women is needed in the great work\nof preaching the truth.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 2, 1879.\nHusband and Wife in a United Work\u2014There are women who\nshould labor in the gospel ministry. In many respects they would\ndo more good than the ministers who neglect to visit the flock of\nGod.\u2014Manuscript 43a, 1898.\nWisdom Needed to Choose Gospel Teachers\u2014There should\nbe selected for the work wise, consecrated men who can do a good\nwork in reaching souls. Women also should be chosen who can\npresent the truth in a clear, intelligent, straightforward manner. We\nneed among us laborers who see the need of a deep work of grace\nto be done in hearts; and such should be encouraged to engage in\nearnest missionary effort. There has long been the need for more of\nthis class of workers. We must pray most earnestly, \u201cLord, help us\nto help one another.\u201d Self must be buried with Christ, and we must\nbe baptized with the Holy Spirit of God. Then will be revealed in\nspeech, in spirit, and in our manner of labor the fact that the Spirit\nof God is guiding.\nWe need as workers men and women who understand the reasons\nof our faith and who realize the work to be done in communicating\ntruth, and who will refuse to speak any words that will weaken the\nconfidence of any soul in the Word of God or destroy the fellowship\nthat should exist between those of like faith.\u2014Letter 54, 1909.\nA Bible Instructor Addresses Congregation \u2014Every week\ntells its story; one soul or two souls receive the truth, and the won-\nderful change in their features and in their character is so marked by [473]\ntheir neighbor that the conviction of the very life of their neighbors is\n425\n426 Evangelism\nleading others to the truth; and they are now searching the Scriptures\ndiligently....\nSister R and Sister W are doing just as efficient work as the\nministers; and some meetings when the ministers are all called away,\nSister W takes the Bible and addresses the congregation.\u2014Letter\n169, 1900.\nA Sister to Address the Crowd \u2014We believe fully in church\norganization, but in nothing that is to prescribe the precise way in\nwhich we must work; for all minds are not reached by the same\nmethods....\nEach person has his own lamp to keep burning.... Very much\nmore light shines from one such lamp onto the path of the wanderer,\nthan would be given by a whole torchlight procession got up for\nparade and show. Oh, what a work may be done if we will not stretch\nourselves beyond our measure!\nTeach this, my sister. You have many ways opened before you.\nAddress the crowd whenever you can; hold every jot of influence you\ncan by any association that can be made the means of introducing\nthe leaven to the meal. Every man and every woman has a work to\ndo for the Master. Personal consecration and sanctification to God\nwill accomplish, through the most simple methods, more than the\nmost imposing display.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 9, 1899.\nCamp Meeting Bible Class Conducted by Women \u2014Our\ncamp meetings are to be conducted in such a way that they shall\nbe schools for the education of workers. We need to have a better\nunderstanding of the division of labor, and educate all how to carry\neach part of the work successfully.... Let short discourses be given,\nand then let Bible classes be held. Let the speaker be sure to rivet\nthe truth upon minds. Intelligent women, if truly converted, can act[474]\na part in this work of holding Bible classes. There is a wide field of\nservice for women as well as for men.\u2014Letter 84, 1910.\nTraining and Background\nThe Value of Well-trained Workers\u2014God calls for laborers;\nbut He wants those who are willing to submit their wills to His, and\nwho will teach the truth as it is in Jesus. One worker who has been\ntrained and educated for the work, who is controlled by the Spirit\nof Christ, will accomplish far more than ten laborers who go out\ndeficient in knowledge and weak in the faith. One who works in\nharmony with the counsel of God, and in unity with the brethren,\nwill be more efficient to do good than ten will be who do not realize\nthe necessity of depending upon God and of acting in harmony with\nthe general plan of the work.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 29,\n1888.\nBible Workers From Our Schools\u2014In every school that God\nhas established there will be, as never before, demand for Bible in-\nstruction. Our students are to be educated to become Bible workers,\nand the Bible teachers can do a most wonderful work if they will\nthemselves learn from the great Teacher.\nGod\u2019s Word is true philosophy, true science. Human opinions\nand sensational preaching amount to very little. Those who are\nimbued with the Word of God can teach it in the same simple way\nin which Christ taught it. Too much depends on the opening of the\nScriptures to those in darkness for us to use one word that cannot be\nreadily understood....\nThere is need of workers who will come close to unbelievers,\nnot waiting for unbelievers to come close to them, workers who will [475]\nsearch for the lost sheep, who will do personal labor, and who will\ngive clear, definite instruction.\nIt should be the aim of our schools to provide the best instruction\nand training for Bible workers. Our conferences should see that the\nschools are provided with teachers who are thorough Bible teachers\nand who have a deep Christian experience. The best ministerial\ntalent should be brought into schools.\u2014Manuscript 139, 1898.\n427\n428 Evangelism\nA Broad Education Including Bible Work\u2014The Lord designs\nthat the school should also be a place where a training may be gained\nin women\u2019s work\u2014cooking, housework, dressmaking, bookkeeping,\ncorrect reading, and pronunciation. They are to be qualified to\ntake any post that may be offered\u2014superintendents, Sabbath school\nteachers, Bible workers. They must be prepared to teach day schools\nfor children.\u2014Letter 3, 1898.\nExperienced Workers Not Boys and Girls\u2014Ministerial labor\ncannot and should not be entrusted to boys, neither should the work\nof giving Bible readings be entrusted to inexperienced girls, because\nthey offer their services and are willing to take responsible positions,\nbut who are wanting in religious experience, without a thorough\neducation and training. They must be proved to see if they will\nbear the test; and unless there is developed as firm, conscientious\nprinciple to be all that God would have them to be, they will not\ncorrectly represent our cause and work for this time.\nThere must be with our sisters engaged in the work in every\nmission, a depth of experience, gained from those who have had an\nexperience, and who understand the manners and ways of working.\nThe missionary operations are constantly embarrassed for the want [476]\nof workers of the right class of minds, and the devotion and piety\nthat will correctly represent our faith.\u2014Christian Education, 45, 46\n(1894).\nWork Calls for Intelligence \u2014Young men should not enter\nupon the work of explaining the Scriptures and lecturing upon the\nprophecies, when they do not have a knowledge of the important\nBible truths they try to explain to others. They may be deficient\nin the common branches of education, and therefore fail to do the\namount of good they could do if they had had the advantages of a\ngood school. Ignorance will not increase the humility or spirituality\nof any professed follower of Christ. The truths of the divine Word\ncan be best appreciated by an intellectual Christian. Christ can be\nbest glorified by those who serve Him intelligently. The great object\nof education is to enable us to use the powers which God has given\nus in such a manner as will best represent the religion of the Bible\nand promote the glory of God.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:160\n(1872).\nTraining and Background 429\nThoroughly Trained Workers\u2014The third angel is represented\nas flying in the midst of the heavens, showing that the message is\nto go forth throughout the length and breadth of the earth. It is the\nmost solemn message ever given to mortals, and all who connect\nwith the work should first feel their need of an education, and a most\nthorough training process for the work, in reference to their future\nusefulness; and there should be plans made and efforts adopted for\nthe improvement of that class who anticipate connecting with any\nbranch of the work.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 21, 1887.\nTeacher Must Know Real Principles of Truth\u2014Be sure that\nyou know the real principles of the truth; and then when you meet [477]\nopponents, it will not be in your own strength; an angel of God will\nstand by your side, to help in answering every question that may\nbe asked. Day by day you are to be shut in, as it were, with Jesus;\nand then your words and example will have a strong influence for\ngood.\u2014Gospel Workers, 105 (1915).\nAn Appeal for More Educated Bible Instructors \u2014I wish to\ncreate a fund for the payment of these devoted women who are the\nmost useful workers in giving Bible readings. I am also led to say\nthat we must educate more workers to give Bible readings.\u2014Letter\n83, 1899.\nBible Instructor\u2019s Qualifications\nCaliber of Women for God\u2019s Work\u2014Women of firm principle\nand decided character are needed, women who believe that we are\nindeed living in the last days, and that we have the last solemn\nmessage of warning to be given to the world. They should feel that\nthey are engaged in an important work in spreading the rays of light\nwhich Heaven has shed upon them. Nothing will deter this class from\ntheir duty. Nothing will discourage them in the work. They have\nfaith to work for time and for eternity. They fear God, and will not\nbe diverted from the work by the temptation of lucrative situations\nand attractive prospects. The Sabbath of the fourth commandment\nis sacredly kept by them, because God has placed His sanctity upon\nit, and has bidden them to keep it holy. They will preserve their\nintegrity at any cost to themselves.... These are the ones who will\ncorrectly represent our faith, whose words will be fitly spoken, like\napples of gold in pictures of silver....Sisters, God calls you to work[478]\nin the harvest field and help gather in the sheaves.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, December 19, 1878.\nFresh, Uncrippled Energies\u2014In order that the work may go\nforward in all its branches, God calls for youthful vigor, zeal, and\ncourage. He has chosen the youth to aid in the advancement of\nHis cause. To plan with clear mind and execute with courageous\nhand demands fresh, uncrippled energies. Young men and women\nare invited to give God the strength of their youth, that through\nthe exercise of their powers, through keen thought and vigorous\naction, they may bring glory to Him and salvation to their fellow\nmen.\u2014Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 535 (1913).\nThere is need of young men and women who will not be swayed\nby circumstances, who walk with God, who pray much, and who\nput forth earnest efforts to gather all the light they can.\u2014Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Students, 537 (1913).\nPersevering Women\u2014All who work for God should have the\nMartha and the Mary attributes blended\u2014a willingness to minister,\n430\nBible Instructor\u2019s Qualifications 431\nand a sincere love of the truth. Self and selfishness must be put\nout of sight. God calls for earnest women workers, workers who\nare prudent, warmhearted, tender, and true to principle. He calls\nfor persevering women, who will take their minds from self and\ntheir personal convenience, and will center them on Christ, speaking\nwords of truth, praying with the persons to whom they can obtain\naccess, laboring for the conversion of souls.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 6:118 (1900).\nWomen With Powers to Make Right Decisions \u2014There are\nnoble women who have had moral courage to decide in favor of\nthe truth from the weight of evidence. They have conscientiously\naccepted the truth. They have tact, perception, and good ability, and [479]\nwill make successful workers for their Master. Christian women are\ncalled for.\u2014The Review and Herald, December 19, 1878.\nForce of Character and Power of Influence\u2014Some who en-\ngage in missionary service are weak, nerveless, spiritless, easily\ndiscouraged. They lack push. They have not those positive traits of\ncharacter that give power to do something\u2014the spirit and energy\nthat kindle enthusiasm. Those who would win success must be\ncourageous and hopeful. They should cultivate not only the passive\nbut the active virtues. While they are to give the soft answer that\nturns away wrath, they must possess the courage of a hero to resist\nevil. With the charity that endures all things, they need the force\nof character that will make their influence a positive power.\u2014.The\nMinistry of Healing, 497, 498 (1905).\nGo to Bottom of Every Subject \u2014If you are called to be a\nteacher in any branch of the work of God, you are called also to be\na learner in the school of Christ. If you take upon you the sacred\nresponsibility of teaching others, you take upon you the duty of\ngoing to the bottom of every subject you seek to teach.\u2014Counsels\non Sabbath School Work, 31 (1892).\nCourage, Force, Energy, Perseverance\u2014Christian life is more\nthat many take it to be. It does not consist wholly in gentleness,\npatience, meekness, and kindliness. These graces are essential; but\nthere is need also of courage, force, energy, and perseverance. The\npath that Christ marks out is a narrow, self-denying path. To enter\nthat path and press on through difficulties and discouragements,\nrequires men who are more than weaklings....\n432 Evangelism\nSome have no firmness of character. Their plans and purposes[480]\nhave no definite form and consistency. They are of but little practical\nuse in the world. This weakness, indecision, and inefficiency should\nbe overcome. There is in true Christian character an indomitableness\nthat cannot be molded or subdued by adverse circumstances. We\nmust have moral backbone, an integrity that cannot be flattered,\nbribed, or terrified.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 497, 498 (1905).\nAlertness and Precision\u2014The cause of God demands men who\ncan see quickly and act instantaneously at the right time and with\npower. If you wait to measure every difficulty and balance every\nperplexity you meet, you will do but little. You will have obstacles\nand difficulties to encounter at every turn, and you must with firm\npurpose decide to conquer them, or they will conquer you.\u2014Testi-\nmonies For The Church 3:497 (1875).\nSystem and Speed in All Work\u2014Your room may contain many\nlittle ornaments placed there for admiration; but if you would have\nan eye single to the glory of God, you would do well to pack away\nthese little idols. In handling, dusting, and replacing them, many\nprecious moments are spent that might be employed in needful work.\nBut if these trinkets are not to be stored away, then you have another\nlesson to learn. Be expeditious. Do not dreamily take up every\narticle, and keep it in your hand, as though loath to lay it down. It\nis the duty of those who are slow in their movements to improve in\nthis respect. The Lord has said, \u201cNot slothful in business; fervent in\nspirit; serving the Lord.\u201d\nIn preparing the meals, make your calculations, giving yourself\nall the time that you know by experience you will require in order to[481]\ncook the food thoroughly and place it upon the table at the proper\ntime. But it is better to be ready five minutes before the time than to\nbe five minutes late. In washing dishes, also, the work may be done\nwith dispatch, and yet with care and thoroughness. Slow, dilatory\nhabits make much work out of very little. But if you will, you may\novercome these fussy, lingering habits. The exercise of the will\npower will make the hands move deftly.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor,\nJanuary 28, 1897.\nBible Work Techniques\nSimple, Spirited Bible Readings\u2014We must arise, and co-op-\nerate with Christ.... Obey the gospel commission; go forth into the\nhighways and hedges. Visit as many places as possible. Conduct\nsimple, spirited Bible readings, which will have a correct influence\nupon minds.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1910.\nA Message to Startle People to Study \u2014The testing message\nfor this time is to be borne so plainly and decidedly as to startle\nthe hearers, and lead them to desire to study the Scriptures.\u2014Testi-\nmonies For The Church 9:109 (1909).\nTeach to Approach Bible in Spirit of Learner\u2014The student\nof the Bible should be taught to approach it in the spirit of a learner.\nWe are to search its pages, not for proof to sustain our opinions, but\nin order to know what God says.\u2014Education, 189 (1903).\nEvery Bible Study Must Have a Distinct Plan\u2014Every teacher\nshould see to it that his work tends to definite results. Before at-\ntempting to teach a subject, he should have a distinct plan in mind,\nand should know just what he desires to accomplish. He should not [482]\nrest satisfied with the presentation of any subject until the student\nunderstands the principle involved, perceives its truth, and is able to\nstate clearly what he has learned.\u2014Education, 233, 234 (1903).\nSimplicity in Words\u2014Never search for words that will give the\nimpression that you are learned. The greater your simplicity, the\nbetter will your words be understood.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n6:383 (1900).\nSimple Explanation Better Than Argument \u2014Argument is\ngood in its place, but far more can be accomplished by simple expla-\nnations of the Word of God. The lessons of Christ were illustrated\nso clearly that the most ignorant could readily comprehend them.\nJesus did not use long and difficult words in His discourses; He used\nplain language, adapted to the minds of the common people. He\nwent no farther into the subject He was expounding than they were\nable to follow Him.\u2014Gospel Workers, 169 (1915).\n433\n434 Evangelism\nFew Arguments May Suffice\u2014It is not the best policy to be so\nvery explicit, and say all upon a point that can be said, when a few\narguments will cover the ground, and be sufficient for all practical\npurposes, to convince or silence opponents.\u2014Gospel Workers, 376\n(1915).\nPresent Truth in Easy Style\u2014In this age, when pleasing fables\nare drifting upon the surface and attracting the mind, truth presented\nin an easy style, backed up with a few strong proofs, is better than\nto search and bring forth an overwhelming array of evidence; for\nthe point then does not stand so distinct in many minds as before\nthe objections and evidences were brought before them. With many,\nassertions will go farther than long arguments. They take many\nthings for granted. Proof does not help the case in the minds of[483]\nsuch.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:36 (1872).\nLine Upon Line\u2014Let the truth be presented as it is in Jesus,\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 9:240 (1909).\nThe Power of Christian Sympathy\u2014Kindly words simply spo-\nken, little attentions simply bestowed, will sweep away the clouds\nof temptation and doubt that gather over the soul. The true heart-ex-\npression of Christlike sympathy, given in simplicity, has power to\nopen the door of hearts that need the simple, delicate touch of the\nSpirit of Christ.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:30 (1909).\nFind Your Way to Their Hearts\u2014Wherever you can gain ac-\ncess to the people by the fireside, improve your opportunity. Take\nyour Bible, and open before them its great truths. Your success will\nnot depend so much upon your knowledge and accomplishments,\nas upon your ability to find your way to the heart. By being social\nand coming close to the people, you may turn the current of their\nthoughts more readily than by the most able discourse.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 193 (1915).\nTeaching and Practicing Principles\u2014Not as a dry theory were\nthese things to be taught. Those who would impart truth must\nthemselves practice its principles. Only reflecting the character of\nGod in the uprightness, nobility, and unselfishness of their own lives\ncan they impress others.\u2014Education, 41, (1903).\nInfluence of Cross on Soul Winning \u2014The cross of Calvary\nis to be lifted high above the people, absorbing their minds, and\nBible Work Techniques 435\nconcentrating their thoughts.... The workers will send forth to the\nworld beams of light, as living agencies to enlighten the earth.\u2014 [484]\nMount of Blessing, p. 70. (1896).\nAnswer Questions\u2014The best work you can do is to teach, to\neducate. Whenever you can find an opportunity to do so, sit down\nwith some family, and let them ask questions. Then answer them\npatiently, humbly. Continue this work in connection with your\nmore public efforts. Preach less, and educate more, by holding\nBible readings, and by praying with families and little companies.\u2014\nGospel Workers, 193 (1915).\nPersonal, Patient, Thorough Bible Work \u2014Many a laborer\nfails in his work because he does not come close to those who\nmost need his help. With the Bible in hand, he should seek in a\ncourteous manner to learn the objections which exist in the minds\nof those who are beginning to inquire, \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d Carefully\nand tenderly should he lead and educate them, as pupils in a school.\nMany have to unlearn theories which they have long believed to\nbe truth. As they become convinced that they have been in error\nconcerning Bible subjects, they are thrown into perplexity and doubt.\nThey need the tenderest sympathy and the most judicious help; they\nshould be carefully instructed, and should be prayed for and prayed\nwith, watched and guarded with the kindest solicitude.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 190, 191 (1915).\nWhere There Is Prejudice\u2014Christ drew the hearts of His hear-\ners to Him by the manifestation of His love, and then, little by little,\nas they were able to bear it, He unfolded to them the great truths of\nthe kingdom. We also must learn to adapt our labors to the condition\nof the people\u2014to meet men where they are. While the claims of the\nlaw of God are to be presented to the world, we should never forget\nthat love\u2014the love of Christ\u2014is the only power that can soften the [485]\nheart and lead to obedience.\nAll the great truths of the Scriptures center in Christ; rightly\nunderstood, all lead to Him. Let Christ be presented as the alpha and\nomega, the beginning and the end, of the great plan of redemption.\nPresent to the people such subjects as will strengthen their confidence\nin God and in His Word, and lead them to investigate its teachings\nfor themselves. And as they go forward, step by step, in the study of\nthe Bible, they will be better prepared to appreciate the beauty and\n436 Evangelism\nharmony of its precious truths.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 13,\n1912.\nPresent Testing Truths After Conversion \u2014You should not\nfeel it your duty to introduce arguments upon the Sabbath question\nas you meet the people. If persons mention the subject, tell them that\nthis is not your burden now. But when they surrender heart and mind\nand will to God, they are then prepared candidly to weigh evidence\nin regard to these solemn, testing truths.\u2014Letter 77, 1895.\nMessage More Than Argument\u2014Formal, set phrases, the pre-\nsentation of merely argumentative subjects, is not productive of\ngood. The melting love of God in the hearts of the workers will\nbe recognized by those for whom they labor. Souls are thirsting\nfor the waters of life. Do not be empty cisterns. If you reveal the\nlove of Christ to them, you may lead the hungering, thirsting ones\nto Jesus, and He will give them the bread of life and the waters of\nsalvation.\u2014Letter 77, 1895.\nRecount Your Own Experience in Conversion\u2014Arouse every\nspiritual energy to action. Tell those whom you visit the end of all\nthings is at hand. The Lord Jesus Christ will open the door of their\nhearts, and will make upon their minds lasting impressions. Strive to[486]\narouse men and women from their spiritual insensibility. Tell them\nhow you found Jesus, and how blessed you have been since you\ngained an experience in His service. Tell them what blessing comes\nto you as you sit at the feet of Jesus, and learn precious lessons\nfrom His Word. Tell them of the gladness and joy that there is in the\nChristian life. Your warm, fervent words will convince them that you\nhave found the pearl of great price. Let your cheerful, encouraging\nwords show that you have certainly found the higher way. This is\ngenuine missionary work, and as it is done, many will awake as from\na dream.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:38 (1909).\nSoul Winner\u2019s Intercession the Secret of Success \u2014In times\npast there were those who fastened their minds upon one soul after\nanother, saying, \u201cLord, help me to save this soul.\u201d But now such\ninstances are rare. How many act as if they realized the peril of\nsinners? How many take those whom they know to be in peril,\npresenting them to God in prayer, and supplicating Him to save\nthem?\u2014Gospel Workers, 65.\nLessons from the Master Teacher\nPresent Word in Christ\u2019s Way\u2014If you are presenting the Word\nin Christ\u2019s way, your audience will be deeply impressed with the\ntruths you teach. The conviction will come to them that this is the\nWord of the living God.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:143 (1909).\nPatient Love and Interest in the Lost\u2014He taught the people\nwith patient love. His deep, searching wisdom knew the wants of\nevery soul among His listeners; and when He saw them refuse the [487]\nmessage of peace and love that He came to give them, His heart felt\nanguish to the very depths.\u2014Gospel Workers, 49 (1915).\nMeekness and Humility\u2014There was in His manner no taint of\nbigotry, no cold austerity. The world\u2019s Redeemer had a greater than\nangelic nature, yet united with His divine majesty were meekness\nand humility that attracted all to Himself.\u2014Mount of Blessing, pp.\n29, 30. (1896).\nHope Inspires Desire and Faith \u2014In every human being He\ndiscerned infinite possibilities. He saw men as they might be, trans-\nfigured by His grace,\u2014in \u201cthe beauty of the Lord our God.\u201d Looking\nupon them with hope, He inspired hope. Meeting them with confi-\ndence, He inspired trust. Revealing in Himself man\u2019s true ideal, He\nawakened, for its attainment, both desire and faith. In His presence\nsouls despised and fallen realized that they still were men, and they\nlonged to prove themselves worthy of His regard. In many a heart\nthat seemed dead to all things holy were awakened new impulses.\nTo many a despairing one there opened the possibility of a new\nlife.\u2014Education, 80 (1903).\nEarnestness and Convicting Power\u2014As men and women lis-\ntened to the truths that fell from His lips, so different from the\ntraditions and dogmas taught by the rabbis, hope sprang up in their\nhearts. In His teaching there was an earnestness that sent His words\nhome with convicting power.\u2014Gospel Workers, 188 (1915).\nRadiating Life and Cheer\u2014As He passed through the towns\nand cities, He was like a vital current, diffusing life and joy.\u2014The [488]\n437\n438 Evangelism\nMinistry of Healing, 20 (1905).\nWe may be cheerful. God does not want any sour faces on this\nground; the Lord does not want anyone in gloom and sadness; He\nwants you to lift up your countenance to Him, and let Him just pour\nupon it the brightness of the light of the Sun of Righteousness.\u2014\nManuscript 42, 1894.\nChrist Taught With Authority\u2014While His teaching was sim-\nple, He spoke as one having authority. This characteristic set His\nteaching in contrast with that of all others. The rabbis spoke with\ndoubt and hesitancy, as if the Scriptures might be interpreted to\nmean one thing or exactly the opposite. The hearers were daily\ninvolved in greater uncertainty. But Jesus taught the Scriptures as\nof unquestionable authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented\nwith power, as if His words could not be controverted.\u2014The Desire\nof Ages, 253 (1898).\nDesire to Save Sinners\u2014The same intensity of desire to save\nsinners that marked the life of the Saviour marks the life of His true\nfollower.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:10 (1902).\nImpelling Power\u2014The prompt, unquestioning obedience of\nthese men, with no promise of wages, seems remarkable; but the\nwords of Christ were an invitation that carried with it an impelling\npower.\u2014Gospel Workers, 24 (1915).\nResults of Bible Work\nAngels Close to Worker\u2014As the worker seeks to give to others\nthe light God has given him, the Lord imparts increased light; and\ndoing his best, with an eye single to the glory of God, he realizes [489]\nthe value of souls. As he visits from house to house, opening the\nScriptures to those whose understanding is darkened, angels of God\nwill be close beside him to impress the heart of the one who is athirst\nfor the water of life.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 6, 1896.\nLord Works With Bible Instructors\u2014Let strong reasons for\nour faith be presented from the Word of God, and let the truth in\nits sanctifying power melt its way to the hearts and minds of those\nwho are under conviction. As the helpers give Bible readings in the\nhomes of the people, the Lord just as surely works on minds as He\ndoes in the public services.\u2014Letter 160, 1901.\nMiracles Wrought Through the Word\u2014There will constantly\nbe a struggle in order to gain access to the hearts of the ignorant and\nwicked. But do we individually try as earnestly and faithfully by\npersonal effort as we should? Do we not hold ourselves too much\naloof from the poor souls dead in trespasses and sins? Can we not,\nevery one of us, arm ourselves with the intense earnestness of Christ,\nand do more?\nI fear that there is not that faith that is essential. Shall we not\nbrace ourselves against disappointments and temptations to be dis-\ncouraged? God is merciful, and with the truth rejoicing, purifying,\nennobling the life, we can do a sound and solid work for God. Prayer\nand faith will do wonderful things. The Word must be our weapon\nof warfare. Miracles can be wrought through the Word; for it is\nprofitable for all things.\u2014Letter 75, 1896.\nThe Worth of a Soul\u2014The soul that has given himself to Christ\nis more precious in His sight than the whole world.\u2014The Desire of\nAges, 480 (1898).\nIf but one soul would have accepted the gospel of His grace, [490]\nChrist would, to save that one, have chosen His life of toil and\n439\n440 Evangelism\nhumiliation and His death of shame.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 135\n(1905).\nLet This Work Go Forward\u2014Many will hear the message, but\nwill refuse to heed; nevertheless the warning is to be given to all\nin clear, plain tones. Not only is the truth to be presented in public\nassemblies; house-to-house work is to be done. Let this work go\nforward in the name of the Lord. Those who engage in it have the\nheavenly angels as their companions. They will resist the attacks\nmade by the enemy on those who are co-operating with God.\u2014Letter\n140, 1903.\nIn the Confidence of God\u2019s Promises \u2014The good seed may\nfor a time lie unnoticed in a cold, selfish, worldly heart, giving no\nevidence that it has taken root; but afterward, as the Spirit of God\nbreathes on the soul, the hidden seed springs up, and at last bears\nfruit to the glory of God. In our lifework we know not which shall\nprosper, this or that. This is not a question for us to settle. We are to\ndo our work, and leave the results with God. \u201cIn the morning sow\nthy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand.\u201d\nGod\u2019s great covenant declares that \u201cwhile the earth remaineth,\nseedtime and harvest ... shall not cease.\u201d In the confidence of this\npromise the husbandman tills and sows. Not less confidently are\nwe in the spiritual sowing to labor, trusting His assurance, \u201cSo shall\nMy word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return\nunto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it\nshall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\u201d \u201cHe that goeth forth and\nweepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with\nrejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.\u201d\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons,\n65 (1900).\nAdequate Wages for Women Workers [491]\nTo be Paid as Verily as Their Husbands\u2014When it is possible,\nlet the minister and his wife go forth together. The wife can often\nlabor by the side of her husband, accomplishing a noble work. She\ncan visit the homes of the people and help the women in these\nfamilies in a way that her husband cannot....\nSelect women who will act an earnest part. The Lord will use\nintelligent women in the work of teaching. And let none feel that\nthese women, who understand the Word, and who have ability to\nteach, should not receive remuneration for their labors. They should\nbe paid as verily as are their husbands. There is a great work for\nwomen to do in the cause of present truth. Through the exercise\nof womanly tact and a wise use of their knowledge of Bible truth,\nthey can remove difficulties that our brethren cannot meet. We\nneed women workers to labor in connection with their husbands, and\nshould encourage those who wish to engage in this line of missionary\neffort.\u2014Letter 142, 1909.\nSacrificing Not to Be Limited to Faithful Women \u2014A great\nwork is to be done in our world, and every talent is to be used in\naccordance with righteous principles. If a woman is appointed by\nthe Lord to do a certain work, her work is to be estimated according\nto its value. Every laborer is to receive his or her just due.\nIt may be thought to be a good plan to allow persons to give\ntalent and earnest labor to the work of God, while they draw nothing\nfrom the treasury. But this is making a difference, and selfishly\nwithholding from such workers their due. God will not put His\nsanction on any such plan. Those who invented this method may [492]\nhave thought that they were doing God service by not drawing from\nthe treasury to pay these God-fearing, soul-loving laborers. But\nthere will be an account to settle by and by, and then those who now\nthink this exaction, this partiality in dealing, a wise scheme, will\nbe ashamed of their selfishness. God sees these things in a light\naltogether different from the light in which finite men view them.\n441\n442 Evangelism\nThose who work earnestly and unselfishly, be they men or\nwomen, bring sheaves to the Master; and the souls converted by\ntheir labor will bring their tithes to the treasury. When self-denial is\nrequired because of a dearth of means, do not let a few hard-working\nwomen do all the sacrificing. Let all share in making the sacrifice.\nGod declares, I hate robbery for burnt offering.\u2014Manuscript 47,\n1898.\nTo Be Paid From the Tithe\u2014The tithe should go to those who\nlabor in word and doctrine, be they men or women.\u2014Manuscript\n149, 1899.\nA Procedure Which Will Limit Women Workers\u2014Injustice\nhas sometimes been done to women who labor just as devotedly as\ntheir husbands, and who are recognized by God as being necessary\nto the work of the ministry. The method of paying men laborers, and\nnot paying their wives who share their labors with them, is a plan not\naccording to the Lord\u2019s order, and if carried out in our conferences,\nis liable to discourage our sisters from qualifying themselves for\nthe work they should engage in. God is a God of justice, and if the\nministers receive a salary for their work, their wives who devote\nthemselves just as disinterestedly to the work, should be paid in\naddition to the wages their husbands receive, even though they may\nnot ask for this.\nSeventh-day Adventists are not in any way to belittle woman\u2019s[493]\nwork. If a woman puts her housework in the hands of a faithful, pru-\ndent helper, and leaves her children in good care, while she engages\nin the work, the conference should have wisdom to understand the\njustice of her receiving wages.\u2014Gospel Workers, 452, 453 (1915).\nGod Has Settled This Question \u2014If women do the work that\nis not the most agreeable to many of those who labor in word and\ndoctrine, and if their works testify that they are accomplishing a\nwork that has been manifestly neglected, should not such labor be\nlooked upon as being as rich in results as the work of the ordained\nministers? Should it not command the hire of the laborer? ...\nThis question is not for men to settle. The Lord has settled it.\nYou are to do your duty to the women who labor in the gospel,\nwhose work testifies that they are essential to carrying the truth into\nfamilies. Their work is just the work that must be done, and should\nbe encouraged. In many respects a woman can impart knowledge\nAdequate Wages for Women Workers 443\nto her sisters that a man cannot. The cause would suffer great loss\nwithout this kind of labor by women. Again and again the Lord has\nshown me that women teachers are just as greatly needed to do the\nwork to which He has appointed them as are men.\u2014Manuscript 142,\n1903.\nCautions to the Bible Instructor\nPersonal Work More Taxing\u2014Women, as well as men, are\nneeded in the work that must be done. Those women who give\nthemselves to the service of the Lord, who labor for the salvation\nof others by doing house-to-house work, which is as taxing as, and\nmore taxing than, standing before a congregation, should receive[494]\npayment for their labor.\u2014Manuscript 149, 1899.\nAvoid Overwork\u2014There is danger that the women connected\nwith the work will be required to labor too hard without proper\nperiods or rest. Such severe taxation should not be brought upon\nthe workers. Some will not injure themselves, but others, who are\nconscientious, will certainly overwork. Periods of rest are necessary\nfor all, especially women.\u2014Letter 61, 1896.\nWe Are Mortal\u2014Brother _____, I hope you will be very careful\nof Sister _____\u2019s health. Do not allow her to work too much on the\nnerve-taxing strain. You will understand what I mean. She needs to\nunderstand that we are mortal and that if we are not careful of our\nhealth we may lose it.\u2014Letter 44, 1900.\nWhen to Act Independently\u2014There are circumstances under\nwhich it is proper for a women to act promptly and independently,\nmoving with decision in the way she knows to be the way of the\nLord. The wife is to stand by the side of the husband as his equal,\nsharing all the responsibilities of life, rendering due respect to him\nwho has selected her for his life-long companion.\u2014Manuscript 17,\n1891.\nAvoid Praising Men and Familiarity\u2014I am pained when I see\nmen praised, flattered, and petted. God has revealed the fact that\nsome who receive these attentions are unworthy to take His name\ninto their lips; yet they are exalted to heaven in the estimation of\nfinite man, who reads only from outward appearance. My sisters,\nnever pet and flatter poor, failing, erring men, either young or old,\nmarried or unmarried. You know not their weaknesses, and you\nknow not but these very attentions and this profuse praise may prove[495]\n444\nCautions to the Bible Instructor 445\ntheir ruin. I am alarmed at the shortsightedness, the want of wisdom,\nthat many manifest in respect to this familiarity....\nMarried men who accept the attention, the praise and petting, of\nwomen, should be assured that the love and sympathy of this class\nis not worth the obtaining; it is valueless....\nAgain I urge upon you the necessity of purity in every thought,\nin every word, in every action. We have an individual accountability\nto God, an individual work which no one can do for us. It is to make\nthe world better by precept, personal effort, and example. While we\nshould cultivate sociability, let it not be merely for amusement, but\nfor a purpose. There are souls to save.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nNovember 10, 1885.\n446 Evangelism\nSection 15\u2014Song Evangelism [496]\nThe Ministry of Song\nA Soul-saving Instrumentality\u2014The melody of song, poured\nforth from many hearts in clear, distinct utterance, is one of God\u2019s\ninstrumentalities in the work of saving souls.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 5:493 (1889).\nThe Power of Song \u2014As the children of Israel, journeying\nthrough the wilderness, cheered their way by the music of sacred\nsong, so God bids His children today gladden their pilgrim life.\nThere are few means more effective for fixing His words in the\nmemory than repeating them in song. And such song has wonderful\npower. It has power to subdue rude and uncultivated natures; power\nto quicken thought and to awaken sympathy, to promote harmony of\naction, and to banish the gloom and foreboding that destroy courage\nand weaken effort.\nIt is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart\nwith spiritual truth. How often to the soul hard-pressed and ready to\ndespair, memory recalls some word of God\u2019s\u2014the long forgotten\nburden of a childhood song\u2014and temptations lose their power, life\ntakes on new meaning and new purpose, and courage and gladness\nare imparted to other souls!\u2014Education, 167, 168 (1903).\nA Continual Sermon\u2014These words [song of Moses] were re-\npeated unto all Israel, and formed a song which was often sung,\npoured forth in exalted strains of melody. This was the wisdom of[497]\nMoses to present the truth to them in song, that in strains of melody\nthey should become familiar with them, and be impressed upon\nthe minds of the whole nation, young and old. It was important\nfor the children to learn the song; for this would speak to them,\nto warn, to restrain, to reprove, and encourage. It was a continual\nsermon.\u2014Manuscript 71, 1897.\nFar-reaching Influence\u2014The service of song was made a reg-\nular part of religious worship, and David composed psalms, not\nonly for the use of the priests in the sanctuary service, but also to\nbe sung by the people in their journeys to the national altar at the\n448\nMinistry of Song 449\nannual feasts. The influence thus exerted was far-reaching, and it\nresulted in freeing the nation from idolatry. Many of the surround-\ning peoples, beholding the prosperity of Israel, were led to think\nfavorably of Israel\u2019s God, who had done such great things for His\npeople.\u2014Patriarchs and Prophets, 711 (1890).\nAttracting to the Truth \u2014A few nights since, my mind was\nmuch troubled in contemplating what we could do to get the truth\nbefore the people in these large cities. We are sure if they would\nonly hear the message, some would receive the truth and in their\nturn communicate it to others.\nThe ministers warn their congregations and say it is dangerous\ndoctrine that is presented, and if they go out to hear they will be\ndeceived and deluded with this strange doctrine. The prejudices\nwould be removed if we could get the people out to hear. We are\npraying over this matter and believe that the Lord will make a place\nfor the message of warning and instruction to come to the people in\nthese last days.\nOne night I seemed to be in a council meeting where these\nmatters were being talked over. And a very grave, dignified man [498]\nsaid, \u201cYou are praying for the Lord to raise up men and women\nof talent to give themselves to the work. You have talent in your\nmidst which needs to be recognized.\u201d Several wise propositions were\nmade and then words were spoken in substance as I write them. He\nsaid, \u201cI call your attention to the singing talent which should be\ncultivated; for the human voice in singing is one of God\u2019s entrusted\ntalents to be employed to His glory. The enemy of righteousness\nmakes a great account of this talent in his service. And that which is\nthe gift of God, to be a blessing to souls, is perverted, misapplied,\nand serves the purpose of Satan. This talent of voice is a blessing\nif consecrated to the Lord to serve His cause. _____ has talent,\nbut it is not appreciated. Her position should be considered and\nher talent will attract the people, and they will hear the message of\ntruth.\u2014Letter 62, 1893.\nA Connecting Link With God \u2014There must be a living con-\nnection with God in prayer, a living connection with God in songs\nof praise and thanksgiving.\u2014Letter 96, 1898.\nTo Resist the Enemy\u2014When Christ was a child like these chil-\ndren here, He was tempted to sin, but He did not yield to temptation.\n450 Evangelism\nAs He grew older He was tempted, but the songs His mother had\ntaught Him to sing came into His mind, and He would lift His\nvoice in praise. And before His companions were aware of it, they\nwould be singing with Him. God wants us to use every facility\nwhich Heaven has provided for resisting the enemy.\u2014Manuscript\n65, 1901.\nBringing Heaven\u2019s Gladness\u2014The early morning often found\nHim in some secluded place, meditating, searching the Scriptures,\nor in prayer. With the voice of singing He welcomed the morning\nlight. With songs of thanksgiving He cheered His hours of labor, and[499]\nbrought heaven\u2019s gladness to the toil-worn and disheartened.\u2014The\nMinistry of Healing, 52 (1905).\nThe Song of Praise\u2014Often He expressed the gladness of His\nheart by singing psalms and heavenly songs. Often the dwellers in\nNazareth heard His voice raised in praise and thanksgiving to God.\nHe held communion with heaven in song; and as His companions\ncomplained of weariness from labor, they were cheered by the sweet\nmelody from His lips. His praise seemed to banish the evil angels,\nand, like incense, fill the place with fragrance. The minds of His\nhearers were carried away from their earthly exile, to the heavenly\nhome.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 73, 74.\nA Weapon Against Discouragement\u2014If there was much more\npraising the Lord, and far less doleful recitation of discouragements,\nmany more victories would be achieved.\u2014Letter 53, 1896.\nLet praise and thanksgiving be expressed in song. When tempted,\ninstead of giving utterance to our feelings, let us by faith lift up a\nsong of thanksgiving to God.\nSong is a weapon that we can always use against discouragement.\nAs we thus open the heart to the sunlight of the Saviour\u2019s presence,\nwe shall have health and His blessing.\u2014The Ministry of Healing,\n254 (1905).\nTo Conserve Christian Experience \u2014Evening and morning\njoin with your children in God\u2019s worship, reading His Word and\nsinging His praise. Teach them to repeat God\u2019s law. Concerning the\ncommandments, the Israelites were instructed: \u201cThou shalt teach\nthem diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou\nsittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when\nthou liest down, and when thou risest up.\u201d Accordingly, Moses\nMinistry of Song 451\ndirected the Israelites to set the words of the law to music. While [500]\nthe older children played on instruments, the younger ones marched,\nsinging in concert the song of God\u2019s commandments. In later years\nthey retained in their minds the words of the law which they learned\nduring childhood.\nIf it was essential for Moses to embody the commandments in\nsacred song, so that as they marched in the wilderness, the children\ncould learn to sing the law verse by verse, how essential it is at this\ntime to teach our children God\u2019s Word! Let us come up to the help\nof the Lord, instructing our children to keep the commandments to\nthe letter. Let us do everything in our power to make music in our\nhomes, that God may come in.\u2014The Review and Herald, September\n8, 1904.\nAll Heaven Echoes the Note of Joy \u2014We must bear in mind\nthe great joy manifested by the Shepherd at the recovery of the lost.\nHe calls upon His neighbors, \u201cRejoice with Me; for I have found\nMy sheep which was lost.\u201d And all heaven echoes the note of joy.\nThe Father Himself joys over the rescued one with singing. What a\nholy ecstasy of joy is expressed in this parable! That joy it is your\nprivilege to share.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:125 (1900).\nMusic in Evangelism\nTo Impress Spiritual Truth\u2014Song is one of the most effective\nmeans of impressing spiritual truth upon the heart. Often by the\nwords of sacred song, the springs of penitence and faith have been\nunsealed.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 6, 1912.\nMusical Instruments\u2014Let the talent of singing be brought into\nthe work. The use of musical instruments is not at all objectionable.[501]\nThese were used in religious services in ancient times. The wor-\nshipers praised God upon the harp and cymbal, and music should\nhave its place in our services. It will add to the interest.\u2014Letter 132,\n1898.\nSong Service Not a Concert\u2014The presentation before me was\nthat if Elder _____ would heed the counsel of his brethren, and\nnot rush on in the way he does in making a great effort to secure\nlarge congregations, he would have more influence for good, and his\nwork would have a more telling effect. He should cut off from his\nmeetings everything that has a semblance of theatrical display; for\nsuch outward appearances give no strength to the message that he\nbears. When the Lord can co-operate with him, his work will not\nneed to be done in so expensive a manner. He will not need then\nto go to so much expense in advertising his meetings. He will not\nplace so much dependence on the musical program. This part of his\nservices is conducted more after the order of a concert in a theater,\nthan a song service in a religious meeting.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nLonging for the Word \u2014The hearts of many in the world as\nwell as many church members are hungering for the bread of life\nand thirsting for the waters of salvation. They are interested in the\nservice of song, but they are not longing for that or even prayer.\nThey want to know the Scriptures. What saith the Word of God to\nme? The Holy Spirit is working on mind and heart, drawing them to\nthe bread of life. They see everything round them changing. Human\nfeelings, human ideas of what constitutes religion, change. They\ncome to hear the Word just as it reads.\u2014Manuscript 11, 1899.\n452\nMusic in Evangelism 453\nThe Theme of Every Song\u2014The science of salvation is to be [502]\nthe burden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let it be\npoured forth in every supplication.\u2014Manuscript 107, 1898.\nAvoid Emotionalism\u2014Still others go to the opposite extreme,\nmaking religious emotions prominent, and on special occasions\nmanifesting intense zeal. Their religion seems to be more of the\nnature of a stimulus rather than an abiding faith in Christ.\nTrue ministers know the value of the inward working of the\nHoly Spirit upon human hearts. They are content with simplicity in\nreligious services. Instead of making much of popular singing, they\ngive their principal attention to the study of the Word, and render\npraise to God from the heart. Above the outward adorning they\nregard the inward adorning, the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit.\nIn their mouths is found no guile.\u2014Manuscript 21, 1891.\nMinistry of Song in Homes \u2014Students, go out into the high-\nways and the hedges. Endeavor to reach the higher as well as the\nlower classes. Enter the homes of the rich and the poor, and as you\nhave opportunity, ask, \u201cWould you be pleased to have us sing? We\nshould be glad to hold a song service with you.\u201d Then as hearts are\nsoftened, the way may open for you to offer a few words of prayer\nfor the blessing of God. Not many will refuse.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, August 27, 1903.\nIn House-to-House Ministry \u2014Learn to sing the simplest of\nsongs. These will help you in house-to-house labor, and hearts will\nbe touched by the influence of the Holy Spirit.... We learn from the\nWord that there is joy among the angels over one repentant sinner,\nand that the Lord Himself rejoices over His church with singing.\u2014 [503]\nThe Review and Herald, November 11, 1902.\nCalling for Decisions in Song\u2014In my dreams last night I was\nspeaking to a company of young men. I asked them to sing \u201cAlmost\nPersuaded.\u201d Some present were deeply moved. I knew that they\nwere almost persuaded, but that if they did not make decided efforts\nto return to Christ, the conviction of their sinfulness would leave\nthem. You made some confessions, and I asked you, \u201cWill you not\nfrom this time stand on the Lord\u2019s side?\u201d If you will receive Jesus,\nHe will receive you.\u2014Letter 137, 1904.\nExperience With Song Service on the Cars\u2014On Sabbath we\nhad a song service. Brother Lawrence, who is a musician, led the\n454 Evangelism\nsinging. All the passengers in the car seemed to enjoy the service\ngreatly, many of them joining in the singing.\nOn Sunday we had another song service, after which Elder\nCorliss gave a short talk, taking as his text the words, \u201cBehold, what\nmanner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should\nbe called the sons of God.\u201d The passengers listened attentively and\nseemed to enjoy what was said.\nOn Monday we had more singing, and we all seemed to be\ndrawing closer together.\u2014Letter 135, 1905.\nMusic in the New Earth \u2014Those who, regardless of all else,\nplace themselves in God\u2019s hands, to be and do all that He would\nhave them, will see the King in His beauty. They will behold His\nmatchless charms, and, touching their golden harps, they will fill all\nheaven with rich music and with songs to the Lamb.\nI am glad to hear the musical instruments that you have here.\nGod wants us to have them. He wants us to praise Him with heart\nand soul and voice, magnifying His name before the world.\u2014The[504]\nReview and Herald, June 15, 1905.\nThe Singing Evangelist\nPreparing for Song Evangelism\u2014There should be much more\ninterest in voice culture than is now generally manifested. Students\nwho have learned to sing sweet gospel songs with melody and dis-\ntinctness can do much good as singing evangelists. They will find\nmany opportunities to use the talent that God has given them, carry-\ning melody and sunshine into many lonely places darkened by sin\nand sorrow and affliction, singing to those who seldom have church\nprivileges.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 27, 1903.\nA Power to Win Souls\u2014There is great pathos and music in the\nhuman voice, and if the learner will make determined efforts, he will\nacquire habits of talking and singing that will be to him a power to\nwin souls to Christ.\u2014Manuscript 22, 1886.\nBearing a Special Message in Song\u2014There are those who have\na special gift of song, and there are times when a special message\nis borne by one singing alone or by several uniting in song. But\nthe singing is seldom to be done by a few. The ability to sing is a\ntalent of influence, which God desires all to cultivate and use to His\nname\u2019s glory.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:115, 116 (1902).\nClear Intonations\u2014Distinct Utterance\u2014No words can prop-\nerly set forth the deep blessedness of genuine worship. When human\nbeings sing with the Spirit and the understanding, heavenly musi-\ncians take up the strain, and join in the song of thanksgiving. He\nwho has bestowed upon us all the gifts that enable us to be workers [505]\ntogether with God, expects His servants to cultivate their voices,\nso that they can speak and sing in a way that all can understand.\nIt is not loud singing that is needed, but clear intonation, correct\npronunciation, and distinct utterance. Let all take time to cultivate\nthe voice, so that God\u2019s praise can be sung in clear, soft tones, not\nwith harshness and shrillness that offend the ear. The ability to sing\nis the gift of God; let it be used to His glory.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 9:143, 144 (1909).\n455\n456 Evangelism\nFactors in Effectual Music\u2014Music can be a great power for\ngood; yet we do not make the most of this branch of worship. The\nsinging is generally done from impulse or to meet special cases, and\nat other times those who sing are left to blunder along, and the music\nloses its proper effect upon the minds of those present. Music should\nhave beauty, pathos, and power. Let the voices be lifted in songs of\npraise and devotion. Call to your aid, if practicable, instrumental\nmusic, and let the glorious harmony ascend to God, an acceptable\noffering.\nBut it is sometimes more difficult to discipline the singers and\nkeep them in working order, than to improve the habits of praying\nand exhorting. Many want to do things after their own style; they\nobject to consultation, and are impatient under leadership. Well-\nmatured plans are needed in the service of God. Common sense is\nan excellent thing in the worship of the Lord.\u2014Gospel Workers, 325\n(1892).\nThe Heavenly Song Director \u2014I have been shown the order,\nthe perfect order, of heaven, and have been enraptured as I listened\nto the perfect music there. After coming out of vision, the singing\nhere has sounded very harsh and discordant. I have seen companies\nof angels, who stood in a hollow square, every one having a harp of[506]\ngold.... There is one angel who always leads, who first touches the\nharp and strikes the note, then all join in the rich, perfect music of\nheaven. It cannot be described. It is melody, heavenly, divine, while\nfrom every countenance beams the image of Jesus, shining with\nglory unspeakable.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:146 (1857).\nA Well-directed Song Program\u2014A minister should not give\nout hymns to be sung until it has first been ascertained that they are\nfamiliar to those who sing. A proper person should be appointed\nto take charge of this exercise, and it should be his duty to see that\nsuch hymns are selected as can be sung with the spirit and with the\nunderstanding also.\nSinging is a part of the worship of God, but in the bungling\nmanner in which it is often conducted, it is no credit to the truth,\nand no honor to God. There should be system and order in this as\nwell as every other part of the Lord\u2019s work. Organize a company of\nthe best singers, whose voices can lead the congregation, and then\nlet all who will, unite with them. Those who sing should make an\nSinging Evangelist 457\neffort to sing in harmony; they should devote some time to practice,\nthat they may employ this talent to the glory of God.\nBut singing should not be allowed to divert the mind from the\nhours of devotion. If one must be neglected, let it be the singing.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, July 24, 1883.\nAttractiveness of the Human Voice \u2014The human voice that\nsings the music of God from a heart filled with gratitude and thanks-\ngiving is far more pleasing to Him than the melody of all the musical\ninstruments ever invented by human hands.\u2014Letter 2c, 1892.\nCautions\u2014I was taken into some of your singing exercises, and [507]\nwas made to read the feelings that existed in the company, you\nbeing the prominent one. There were petty jealousies, envy, evil\nsurmisings, and evil speaking.... The heart service is what God\nrequires; the forms and lip service are as sounding brass and a\ntinkling cymbal. Your singing is for display, not to praise God with\nthe spirit and understanding. The state of the heart reveals the quality\nof the religion of the professor of godliness.\u2014Letter 1a, 1890.\nEmphasis in Congregational Singing\nChoir and Congregational Singing\u2014In the meetings held, let\na number be chosen to take part in the song service. And let the\nsinging be accompanied with musical instruments skillfully handled.\nWe are not to oppose the use of instrumental music in our work. This\npart of the service is to be carefully conducted; for it is the praise of\nGod in song.\nThe singing is not always to be done by a few. As often as\npossible, let the entire congregation join.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 9:144 (1909).\nThe Song Service\u2014The singing should not be done by a few\nonly. All present should be encouraged to join in the song service.\u2014\nLetter 157, 1902.\nApproach Harmony of Heavenly Choir\u2014Music forms a part\nof God\u2019s worship in the courts above. We should endeavor in our\nsongs of praise to approach as nearly as possible to the harmony\nof the heavenly choirs. I have often been pained to hear untrained\nvoices, pitched to the highest key, literally shrieking the sacred words\nof some hymn of praise. How inappropriate those sharp, rasping\nvoices for the solemn, joyous worship of God. I long to stop my[508]\nears, or flee from the place, and I rejoice when the painful exercise\nis ended.\nThose who make singing a part of divine worship should select\nhymns with music appropriate to the occasion, not funeral notes,\nbut cheerful, yet solemn melodies. The voice can and should be\nmodulated, softened, and subdued.\u2014The Signs of the Times, June\n22, 1882.\nWith Heart and Understanding \u2014I saw that all should sing\nwith the spirit and with the understanding also. God is not pleased\nwith jargon and discord. Right is always more pleasing to Him than\nwrong. And the nearer the people of God can approach to correct,\nharmonious singing, the more is He glorified, the church benefited,\n458\nEmphasis in Congregational Singing 459\nand unbelievers favorably affected.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n1:146 (1857).\nWithout Spirit and Understanding\u2014Many are singing beau-\ntiful songs in the meetings, songs of what they will do, and what\nthey mean to do; but some do not do these things; they do not sing\nwith the spirit and the understanding also. So in the reading of the\nWord of God, some are not benefited, because they do not take it\ninto their very life, they do not practice it.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nSeptember 27, 1892.\nThe Music Personnel\nThose Whose Hearts Are in the Effort \u2014In their efforts to\nreach the people, the Lord\u2019s messengers are not to follow the ways\nof the world. In the meetings that are held, they are not to depend on\nworldly singers and theatrical display to awaken an interest. How\ncan those who have no interest in the Word of God, who have never[509]\nread His Word with a sincere desire to understand its truths, be\nexpected to sing with the spirit and the understanding? How can\ntheir hearts be in harmony with the words of sacred song? How can\nthe heavenly choir join in music that is only a form?\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 9:143 (1909).\nOnly Sweet, Simple Singing\u2014How can God be glorified when\nyou depend for your singing on a worldly choir that sings for money?\nMy brother, when you see these things in a right light, you will\nhave in your meetings only sweet, simple singing, and you will\nask the whole congregation to join in the song. What if among\nthose present there are some whose voices are not so musical as the\nvoices of others. When the singing is such that angels can unite\nwith the singers, an impression is made on minds that singing from\nunsanctified lips cannot make.\u2014Letter 190, 1902.\nWorldly Musicians\u2014Do not hire worldly musicians if this can\npossibly be avoided. Gather together singers who will sing with the\nspirit and with the understanding also. The extra display which you\nsometimes make entails unnecessary expense, which the brethren\nshould not be asked to meet; and you will find that after a time\nunbelievers will not be willing to give money to meet these ex-\npenses.\u2014Letter 51, 1902.\nAccepting Musical Help Offered \u2014In the meetings held the\nsinging should not be neglected. God can be glorified by this part\nof the service. And when singers offer their services, they should\nbe accepted. But money should not be used to hire singers. Often\nthe singing of simple hymns by the congregation has a charm that\n460\nMusic Personnel 461\nis not possessed by the singing of a choir, however skilled it may\nbe.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nMusic That Offends God\u2014Display is not religion nor sanctifi- [510]\ncation. There is nothing more offensive in God\u2019s sight than a display\nof instrumental music when those taking part are not consecrated,\nare not making melody in their hearts to the Lord. The offering\nmost sweet and acceptable in God\u2019s sight is a heart made humble by\nself-denial, by lifting the cross and following Jesus.\nWe have no time now to spend in seeking those things that only\nplease the senses. Close heart searching is needed. With tears and\nheartbroken confession we need to draw nigh to God that He may\ndraw nigh to us.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 14, 1899.\nGod Glorified\u2014God is glorified by songs of praise from a pure\nheart filled with love and devotion to Him.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 1:509 (1867).\nTimely Cautions\nQualities of Good Music\u2014Great improvement can be made in\nsinging. Some think that the louder they sing the more music they\nmake; but noise is not music. Good singing is like the music of the\nbirds\u2014subdued and melodious.\nIn some of our churches I have heard solos that were altogether\nunsuitable for the service of the Lord\u2019s house. The long-drawn-out\nnotes and the peculiar sounds common in operatic singing are not\npleasing to the angels. They delight to hear the simple songs of\npraise sung in a natural tone. The songs in which every word is\nuttered clearly, in a musical tone, are the songs that they join us in\nsinging. They take up the refrain that is sung from the heart with the\nspirit and the understanding.\u2014Manuscript 91, 1903.\nProper Balance in Time Given to Singing \u2014Improvements[511]\ncan be made in our manner of conducting camp meetings, so that\nall who attend may receive more direct labor. There are some social\nmeetings held in the large tent, where all assemble for worship; but\nthese are so large that only a small number can take part, and many\nspeak so low that but few can hear them.... In some instances much\ntime was devoted to singing. There was a long hymn before prayer,\na long hymn after prayer, and much singing interspersed all through\nthe meeting. Thus golden moments were used unwisely, and not\none-half the good was done that might have been realized had these\nprecious seasons been properly managed.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nNovember 27, 1883.\nCeremony and Display \u2014Form and ceremony do not consti-\ntute the kingdom of God. Ceremonies become multitudinous and\nextravagant as the vital principles of the kingdom of God are lost.\nBut it is not form and ceremony that Christ requires. He hungers to\nreceive from His vineyard fruit in holiness and unselfishness, deeds\nof goodness, mercy, and truth.\nGorgeous apparel, fine singing, and instrumental music in the\nchurch do not call forth the songs of the angel choir. In the sight\n462\nTimely Cautions 463\nof God these things are like the branches of the unfruitful fig tree\nwhich bore nothing but pretentious leaves. Christ looks for fruit,\nfor principles of goodness and sympathy and love. These are the\nprinciples of heaven, and when they are revealed in the lives of\nhuman beings, we may know that Christ is formed within, the hope\nand glory. A congregation may be the poorest in the land, without\nmusic or outward show, but if it possesses these principles, the\nmembers can sing, for the joy of Christ is in their souls, and this [512]\nthey can offer as a sweet oblation to God.\u2014Manuscript 123, 1899.\nMusic Acceptable to God\u2014The superfluities which have been\nbrought into the worship in _____ must be strenuously avoided....\nMusic is acceptable to God only when the heart is sanctified and\nmade soft and holy by its facilities. But many who delight in music\nknow nothing of making melody in their hearts to the Lord. Their\nheart is gone \u201cafter their idols.\u201d\u2014Letter 198, 1899.\nA Misuse of Music\u2014When professing Christians reach the high\nstandard which it is their privilege to reach, the simplicity of Christ\nwill be maintained in all their worship. Forms and ceremonies and\nmusical accomplishments are not the strength of the church. Yet\nthese things have taken the place that God should have, even as they\ndid in the worship of the Jews.\nThe Lord has revealed to me that when the heart is cleansed and\nsanctified, and the members of the church are partakers of the divine\nnature, a power will go forth from the church, who believe the truth,\nthat will cause melody in the heart. Men and women will not then\ndepend upon their instrumental music but on the power and grace of\nGod, which will give fullness of joy. There is a work to be done in\nclearing away the rubbish which has been brought into the church....\nThis message is not only for the church at _____, but for every\nother church that has followed her example.\u2014Manuscript 157, 1899.\n464 Evangelism\nSection 16\u2014Medical Evangelism [513]\n[See pages 657-665 for counsel to the evangelist regarding his\npersonal relationship to health reform.]\nAn Entering Wedge\nOpening Doors for Evangelism\u2014Nothing will open doors for\nthe truth like evangelistic medical missionary work. This will find\naccess to hearts and minds, and will be a means of converting many\nto the truth.\nThe evangelist who is prepared to minister to a diseased body\nis given the grandest opportunity of ministering to the sinsick soul.\nSuch an evangelist should be empowered to administer baptism to\nthose who are converted and desire baptism.... Medical missionary\nwork is the right, helping hand of the gospel, to open doors for the\nproclamation of the message....\nDoors that have been closed to him who merely preaches the\ngospel will be opened to the intelligent medical missionary. God\nreaches hearts through the relief of physical suffering.\u2014Manuscript\n58, 1901.\nThe Great Entering Wedge \u2014I can see in the Lord\u2019s provi-\ndence that the medical missionary work is to be a great entering\nwedge, whereby the diseased soul may be reached.\u2014Counsels on\nHealth, 535 (1893).\nIt Removes Prejudice\u2014Medical missionary work is the pioneer\nwork of the gospel, the door through which the truth for this time is\nto find entrance to many homes.... A demonstration of the principles[514]\nof health reform will do much toward removing prejudice against\nour evangelical work. The Great Physician, the originator of medical\nmissionary work, will bless all who thus seek to impart the truth for\nthis time.\u2014Counsels on Health, 497 (1902).\nIt Gives Access to Hearts\u2014Do medical missionary work. Thus\nyou will gain access to the hearts of the people. The way will be\nprepared for more decided proclamation of the truth. You will find\nthat relieving their physical suffering gives an opportunity to minister\nto their spiritual needs....\n466\nEntering Wedge 467\nThe union of Christlike work for the body and Christlike work\nfor the soul is the true interpretation of the gospel.\u2014An Appeal for\nthe Medical Missionary College, pp. 14, 15. (1902).\nReformative Discourses\u2014I have been informed by my guide\nthat not only should those who believe the truth practice health\nreform but they should also teach it diligently to others; for it will be\nan agency through which the truth can be presented to the attention\nof unbelievers. They will reason that if we have such sound ideas\nin regard to health and temperance, there must be something in our\nreligious belief that is worth investigation. If we backslide in health\nreform we shall lose much of our influence with the outside world.\nThe discourses preached at our large gatherings should be of a\nreformative nature. All the talent possible should be employed to\nset it before the people.\nMany are disgusted with the dry formalism which exists in the\nChristian world. Many are becoming infidels because they see the\nlack of true piety in those who profess to be Christians. A good work\ncould be done to prepare the way for the introduction of the truth [515]\nif decided testimonies were borne upon the health and temperance\nbranch of the work....\nThe matter of presenting true principles of health and temperance\nmust not be passed over as unessential; for nearly every family needs\nto be instructed on this point. Nearly every person needs to have his\nconscience aroused to become a doer of the Word of God, practicing\nself-denial, and abstaining from the unlawful indulgence of appetite.\nWhen you make the people intelligent concerning the principles of\nhealth reform you do much to prepare the way for the introduction of\npresent truth. Said my Guide, \u201cEducate, educate, educate.\u201d The mind\nmust be enlightened, for the understanding of the people is darkened.\nSatan can find access to the soul through perverted appetite, to debase\nand destroy it.\u2014Letter 1, 1875.\nFirmly Linked With Ministry of the Word \u2014The principles\nof health reform are found in the Word of God. The gospel of health\nis to be firmly linked with the ministry of the Word. It is the Lord\u2019s\ndesign that the restoring influence of health reform shall be a part\nof the last great effort to proclaim the gospel message.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 259 (1899).\n468 Evangelism\nIn Many Places \u2014As a means of overcoming prejudice and\ngaining access to minds, medical missionary work must be done,\nnot in one or two places only, but in many places where the truth\nhas not yet been proclaimed. We are to work as gospel medical\nmissionaries, to heal the sin-sick souls by giving them the message\nof salvation. This work will break down prejudice as nothing else\ncan.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:211 (1909).\nNecessary to the Advancement of the Cause \u2014Medical mis-\nsionary work is the right hand of the gospel. It is necessary to the\nadvancement of the cause of God. As through it men and women[516]\nare led to see the importance of right habits of living, the saving\npower of the truth will be made known. Every city is to be entered\nby workers trained to do medical missionary work. As the right hand\nof the third angel\u2019s message, God\u2019s methods of treating disease will\nopen doors for the entrance of present truth.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 7:59 (1902).\nIt Opens Doors \u2014In every place the sick may be found, and\nthose who go forth as workers for Christ should be true health\nreformers, prepared to give those who are sick the simple treatments\nthat will relieve them, and then pray with them. Thus they will open\nthe door for the entrance of the truth. The doing of this work will be\nfollowed by good results.\u2014Medical Ministry, 320 (1911).\nThe True Objective of Medical Evangelism\nYields a Precious Harvest \u2014Medical missionary work gives\nopportunity for carrying forward successful evangelistic work. It is\nas these lines of effort are united, that we may expect to gather the\nmost precious fruit of the Lord.\u2014The Review and Herald, September\n7, 1905.\nComforting, Healing, and Relieving\u2014Christ sought the peo-\nple where they were, and placed before them the great truths in\nregard to His kingdom. As He went from place to place, He blessed\nand comforted the suffering, and healed the sick. This is our work.\nGod would have us relieve the necessities of the destitute.\u2014Letter\n54, 1898.\nThe Pattern in Isaiah 58 \u2014The fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah\ncontains present truth for the people of God. Here we see how [517]\nmedical missionary work and the gospel ministry are to be bound\ntogether as the message is given to the world. Upon those who keep\nthe Sabbath of the Lord is laid the responsibility of doing a work of\nmercy and benevolence. Medical missionary work is to be bound up\nwith the message, and sealed with the seal of God.\u2014Manuscript 22,\n1901.\nHearts Are Softened\u2014The world must have an antidote for sin.\nAs the medical missionary works intelligently to relieve suffering\nand save life, hearts are softened. Those who are helped are filled\nwith gratitude.\nAs the medical missionary works upon the body, God works\nupon the heart. The comforting words that are spoken are a soothing\nbalm, bringing assurance and trust. Often the skilful operator will\nhave an opportunity to tell of the work Christ did while He was\nupon this earth. Tell the suffering one the story of God\u2019s love.\u2014\nManuscript 58, 1901.\nRestoring Faith in God and Man\u2014Many have lost the sense\nof eternal realities, lost the similitude of God, and they hardly know\nwhether they have souls to be saved or not. They have neither faith\n469\n470 Evangelism\nin God nor confidence in man. As they see one with no inducement\nof earthly praise or compensation come into their wretched homes,\nministering to the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and\ntenderly pointing all to Him of whose love and pity the human worker\nis but the messenger\u2014as they see this, their hearts are touched.\nGratitude springs up. Faith is kindled. They see that God cares for\nthem, and they are prepared to listen as His Word is opened.\nAs God\u2019s children devote themselves to this work, many will lay\nhold of the hand stretched out to save them. They are constrained to\nturn from their evil ways. Some of the rescued ones may, through[518]\nfaith in Christ, rise to high places of service, and be entrusted with\nresponsibilities in the work of saving souls. They know by experi-\nence the necessities of those for whom they labor; and they know\nhow to help them; they know what means can best be used to recover\nthe perishing. They are filled with gratitude to God for the blessings\nthey have received; their hearts are quickened by love, and their\nenergies are strengthened to lift up others who can never rise without\nhelp.\u2014The Review and Herald, August 3, 1905.\nThe True Science of Medical Missionary Work \u2014The study\nof surgery and other medical science receives much attention in\nthe world, but the true science of medical missionary work, carried\nforward as Christ carried it, is new and strange to the denominational\nchurches and to the world. But it will find its rightful place when as\na people who have had great light, Seventh-day Adventists awaken\nto their responsibilities and improve their opportunities.\nYoung men and young women must be fitted to engage in med-\nical missionary work as physicians and nurses. But before these\nworkers are sent into the field, they must give evidence that they have\nthe spirit of service, that they are breathing a medical missionary\natmosphere, that they are prepared for evangelical work.\nStudents should be prepared for pioneer missionary work. The\nmedical missionaries who are sent to foreign countries should first\nreceive a most careful education. They are Christ\u2019s ambassadors,\nand they are to work for Him with all the skill they have, praying fer-\nvently that the great Physician will pity and save by His miraculous\npower.\u2014Manuscript 33, 1901.\nTrue Medical Missionary Work\u2014The lesson that we need to[519]\nlearn is, What is true medical missionary work in practical gospel\nTrue Objective of Medical Evangelism 471\nlines? Let us keep before the people everywhere the terms of eternal\nlife, as given in the Word of God. Those who obey this Word,\nreverently giving God the honor that is due Him, will show in their\npractice that they have a knowledge of what constitutes true medical\nmissionary work. Self is to be humbled, not exalted.... It is of\ngreat consequence that all who claim to understand gospel medical\nmissionary work, teach the principles of truth.\u2014Manuscript 126,\n1905.\nRelationship to Gospel Ministry\nMakes Evangelism Twice as Successful\u2014Some utterly fail to\nrealize the importance of missionaries being also medical mission-\naries. A gospel minister will be twice as successful in his work if\nhe understands how to treat disease.... A minister of the gospel,\nwho is also a medical missionary, who can cure physical ailments,\nis a much more efficient worker than one who cannot do this. His\nwork as a minister of the gospel is much more complete.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 245 (1901).\nNot to Be Divorced\u2014Medical missionary work is in no case to\nbe divorced from the gospel ministry. The Lord has specified that\nthe two shall be as closely connected as the arm is with the body.\nWithout this union neither part of the work is complete. The medical\nmissionary work is the gospel in illustration.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 6:240, 241 (1900).\nThe Lord\u2019s Plans for a United Work\u2014But the world\u2019s need\ntoday cannot be met fully by the ministry of God\u2019s servants who[520]\nhave been called to preach the everlasting gospel to every creature.\nWhile it is well, so far as possible, for evangelical workers to learn\nhow to minister to the necessities of the body as well as of the soul,\nthus following the example of Christ, yet they cannot spend all their\ntime and strength in relieving those in need of help. The Lord has\nordained that with those who preach the Word shall be associated\nHis medical missionary workers,\u2014Christian physicians and nurses,\nwho have received special training in the healing of disease and in\nsoul winning.\u2014Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, 468\n(1913).\nMedical Missionaries Are Evangelists\u2014Physicians should re-\nmember that they will often be required to perform the duties of a\nminister. Medical missionaries come under the head of evangelists.\nThe workers should go forth two by two, that they may pray and\nconsult together. Never should they be sent out alone. The Lord\nJesus Christ sent forth His disciples two and two into all the cities of\n472\nRelationship to Gospel Ministry 473\nIsrael. He gave them the commission, \u201cHeal the sick that are therein,\nand say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\u201d\nWe are instructed in the Word of God that an evangelist is a\nteacher. He should also be a medical missionary. But all are not given\nthe same work. \u201cHe gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and\nsome, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting\nof the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the\nbody of Christ\u201d....\nThose who labor in our conferences as ministers should become\nacquainted with the work of ministering to the sick. No minister\nshould be proud that he is ignorant where he should be wise. Medical\nmissionary work connects man with his fellow men and with God. [521]\nThe manifestation of sympathy and confidence is not to be limited\nby time or space.\u2014Medical Ministry, 249, 250 (1901).\nIndifference Among Ministers\u2014There are in our world many\nChristian workers who have not yet heard the grand and wonderful\ntruths that have come to us. These are doing a good work in accor-\ndance with the light which they have, and many of them are more\nadvanced in the knowledge of practical work than are those who\nhave had great light and opportunities.\nThe indifference which has existed among our ministers in regard\nto health reform and medical missionary work is surprising. Some\nwho do not profess to be Christians treat these matters with greater\nreverence than do some of our own people, and unless we arouse,\nthey will go in advance of us.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel\nWorkers, 416, 417 (1898).\nThe Conference President to Recognize It\u2014We now ask those\nwho shall be chosen as presidents of our conferences to make a right\nbeginning in places where nothing has been done. Recognize the\nmedical missionary work as God\u2019s helping hand. As His appointed\nagency it is to have room and encouragement. Medical missionaries\nare to have as much encouragement as any accredited evangelist.\nPray with these workers. Counsel with them if they need counsel.\nDo not dampen their zeal and energy. Be sure by your own conse-\ncration and devotion to keep a high standard before them. Laborers\nare greatly needed in the Lord\u2019s vineyard, and not a word of discour-\nagement should be spoken to those who consecrate themselves to\nthe work.\u2014Medical Ministry, 240, 241 (1901).\n474 Evangelism\nThe Conference Medical Missionary Secretary \u2014The medi-\ncal missionary work is to be closely connected with the work of[522]\npreaching. Men should be appointed to do this work who have\nshown themselves trustworthy, who are true to principle. In every\nconference one man should be set apart to have the oversight. He\nshould be a man who gives evidence that he is conscientious, that\nhe is straightforward when dealing with worldlings and those of our\nfaith. He should be free from covetousness and selfishness.\u2014Letter\n139, 1898.\nCaution Against an Independent Work\u2014As the medical mis-\nsionary work becomes more extended, there will be a temptation to\nmake it independent of our conferences. But it has been presented\nto me that this plan is not right. The different lines of our work are\nbut parts of one great whole. They have one center....\nIn the work of the gospel the Lord uses different instrumentali-\nties, and nothing is to be allowed to separate these instrumentalities.\nNever should a sanitarium be established as an enterprise indepen-\ndent of the church. Our physicians are to unite with the work of the\nministers of the gospel. Through their labors, souls are to be saved,\nthat the name of God may be magnified....\nGod did not design that the medical missionary work should\neclipse the work of the third angel\u2019s message. The arm is not to\nbecome the body. The third angel\u2019s message is the gospel message\nfor these last days, and in no case is it to be overshadowed by other\ninterests and made to appear an unessential consideration. When in\nour institutions anything is placed above the third angel\u2019s message,\nthe gospel is not there the great leading power.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 6:235-241 (1900).\nMedical Ministry Not to Take the Place of Evangelism \u2014[523]\nMedical missionary work is not to take the place of the ministry\nof the Word. It is not to absorb the means which should be used\nto sustain the Lord\u2019s work in foreign fields. From wheresoever the\nmoney in the treasury shall come, it is the Lord\u2019s, and it is not to\nbe used so largely in erecting buildings in America. The donations\nof the people are not to be sunk in lines of work which show little\nresults. The truth is to be proclaimed, that the way of the Lord may\nbe prepared. The trumpet must give no uncertain sound....\nRelationship to Gospel Ministry 475\nMedical missionary work must leave room for the ministry of\nthe Word. Contempt is never to be expressed in regard to the pro-\nmulgation of God\u2019s Word. The third angel\u2019s message must not be\nsmothered to death.\u2014Manuscript 177, 1899.\nThe Last Ministerial Work\u2014I wish to tell you that soon there\nwill be no work done in ministerial lines but medical missionary\nwork. The work of a minister is to minister. Our ministers are to\nwork on the gospel plan of ministering....\nYou will never be ministers after the gospel order till you show\na decided interest in medical missionary work, the gospel of healing\nand blessing and strengthening....\nIt is because of the directions I have received from the Lord\nthat I have the courage to stand among you and speak as I do,\nnotwithstanding the way in which you may look at the medical\nmissionary work. I wish to say that the medical missionary work\nis God\u2019s work. The Lord wants every one of His ministers to come\ninto line. Take hold of the medical missionary work, and it will\ngive you access to the people. Their hearts will be touched as you\nminister to their necessities. As you relieve their sufferings, you will [524]\nfind opportunity to speak to them of the love of Jesus.\u2014Counsels\non Health, 533 (1901).\nSimplicity of Method\nChrist Has Shown How to Help Humanity\u2014Read the record\nof how the Saviour fed the multitude with five loaves and two\nfishes.... This merciful provision for temporal need helped to fasten\nin the minds of the people the gracious words of truth which He had\nspoken....\nIn this miracle Christ has shown how medical missionary work\nis to be bound up with the ministry of the Word. His disciples are\nto take the bread of life and the water of salvation, and give it to\nthose who are longing for spiritual help. And as there is need, they\nare to feed the hungry and clothe the naked. Thus they do double\nservice for the Master. The beauty and utility of the work we do\nfor God consists in its symmetry and harmony and in its all-round\nadaptability and efficiency.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1901.\nCome Close to Suffering Humanity\u2014Christ has left us an ex-\nample, that we should follow in His steps. He always drew near to\nthe most needy, the most hopeless, and, attracted by His sympathy,\nthey came close to Him. He assures every suffering, needy, sinful\nsoul that he will never want for a great Physician to give him spiritual\nhelp. We stand too far away from suffering humanity. Let us draw\nnearer to Christ, that our souls may be filled with His grace, and\nwith a desire to give this grace to others.\u2014Letter 17, 1903.\nIn Practical Lines\u2014We are to remember that the work of reach-\ning souls cannot be confined to any one method. Gospel medical[525]\nmissionary work is to be carried forward, not in the precision of\none man\u2019s lines, but in Christ\u2019s lines. All that is done is to bear the\nimpress of the Holy Spirit. We are to work as Christ worked, in the\nsame practical lines. Then we shall be safe.\nThe divine commission needs no reform. Christ\u2019s way of pre-\nsenting truth cannot be improved upon. The worker who tries to\nbring in methods that will attract the worldly minded, supposing that\nthis will remove the objections that they feel to taking up the cross,\n476\nSimplicity of Method 477\nlessens his influence. Preserve the simplicity of godliness.\u2014Letter\n123, 1903.\nPrepared to Give Simple Treatments\u2014Let our ministers who\nhave gained an experience in preaching the Word learn how to\ngive simple treatments, and then go forth as medical missionary\nevangelists. Workers\u2014gospel medical missionaries\u2014are needed\nnow.\u2014Manuscript 141, 1903.\nTeaching the Principles of Healthful Living\u2014Gospel workers\nshould be able also to give instruction in the principles of healthful\nliving. There is sickness everywhere, and much of it might be\nprevented by attention to the laws of health. The people need to\nsee the bearing of health principles upon their well-being, both for\nthis life and for the life to come. They need to be awakened to their\nresponsibility for the human habitation fitted up by their Creator as\nHis dwelling place, and over which He desires them to be faithful\nstewards.\nThousands need and would gladly receive instruction concerning\nthe simple methods of treating the sick,\u2014methods that are taking\nthe place of the use of poisonous drugs. There is great need of\ninstruction in regard to dietetic reform. Wrong habits of eating and [526]\nthe use of unhealthful food are in no small degree responsible for\nthe intemperance and crime and wretchedness that curse the world.\nIn teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great ob-\nject of reform,\u2014that its purpose is to secure the highest development\nof body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of nature, being\nthe laws of God, are designed for our good; that obedience to them\npromotes happiness in this life, and aids in the preparation for the\nlife to come.\nEncourage the people to study that marvelous organism, the\nhuman system, and the laws by which it is governed. Those who per-\nceive the evidences of God\u2019s love, who understand something of the\nwisdom and beneficence of His laws, and the results of obedience,\nwill come to regard their duties and obligations from an altogether\ndifferent point of view. Instead of looking upon an observance of\nthe laws of health as a matter of sacrifice or self-denial, they will\nregard it as it really is, an inestimable blessing.\nEvery gospel worker should feel that to teach the principles of\nhealthful living is a part of his appointed work. Of this work there is\n478 Evangelism\ngreat need, and the world is open for it.\u2014Counsels on Health, 389,\n390 (1914).\nTo Instruct in Healthful Cookery \u2014Cooking schools should\nbe established, and house-to-house instruction should be given in the\nart of cooking wholesome food. Old and young should learn how to\ncook more simply. Wherever the truth is presented, the people are to\nbe taught how to prepare food in a simple, yet appetizing way. They\nare to be shown that a nourishing diet can be provided without the\nuse of flesh foods.\nTeach the people that it is better to know how to keep well than[527]\nhow to cure disease. Our physicians should be wise educators,\nwarning all against self-indulgence, and showing that abstinence\nfrom the things that God has prohibited is the only way to prevent\nruin of body and mind.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:161 (1909).\nImportance of Cooking Schools\u2014Cooking schools are to be\nestablished in many places. This work may begin in a humble way,\nbut as intelligent cooks do their best to enlighten others, the Lord\nwill give them skill and understanding. The word of the Lord is,\n\u201cForbid them not; for I will reveal Myself to them as their Instructor.\u201d\nHe will work with those who carry out His plans, teaching the people\nhow to bring about a reformation in their diet by the preparation of\nhealthful, inexpensive foods. Thus the poor will be encouraged to\nadopt the principles of health reform; they will be helped to become\nindustrious and self-reliant.\nIt has been presented to me that men and women of capability\nwere being taught of God how to prepare wholesome, palatable\nfoods in an acceptable manner. Many of these were young, and there\nwere also those of mature age. I have been instructed to encourage\nthe conducting of cooking schools in all places where medical mis-\nsionary work is being done. Every inducement to lead the people to\nreform must be held out before them. Let as much light as possible\nshine upon them. Teach them to make every improvement that they\ncan in the preparation of food, and encourage them to impart to\nothers that which they learn.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:113\n(1902).\nGoing From House to House to Teach Cooking \u2014Some\nshould labor from house to house, giving instruction in the art of\ncooking wholesome foods. Many, many will be rescued from physi-[528]\nSimplicity of Method 479\ncal, mental, and moral degeneracy through the influence of health\nreform. These principles will commend themselves to those who\nare seeking for light; and such will advance from this to receive the\nfull truth for this time.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 6, 1912.\nEducate, Educate, Educate\u2014We must educate, educate, edu-\ncate, pleasantly and intelligently. We must preach the truth, pray the\ntruth, and live the truth, bringing it, with its gracious, health-giving\ninfluences, within the reach of those who know it not. As the sick\nare brought into touch with the Life-giver, their faculties of mind and\nbody will be renewed. But in order for this to be, they must practice\nself-denial, and be temperate in all things. Thus only can they be\nsaved from physical and spiritual death, and restored to health.\nWhen the human machinery moves in harmony with the life-\ngiving arrangements of God, as brought to light through the gospel,\ndisease is overcome and health springs forth speedily. When human\nbeings work in union with the Life-giver, who offered up His life\nfor them, happy thoughts fill the mind. Body and mind and soul are\nsanctified. Human beings learn of the great Teacher, and all upon\nwhich they look ennobles and enriches the thoughts. The affections\nare drawn out in gladness and thankfulness to the Creator. The life\nof the man who is renewed in the image of Christ is as a light shining\nin darkness.\u2014Medical Ministry, 262, 263 (1905).\nBroad Views of the Work\u2014There is a science in dealing with\nthose who seem especially weak. If we would teach others, we\nourselves must first learn of Christ. We need broad views, that we\nmay do true medical missionary work....\nWe must exercise tact in dealing with those who seem to be [529]\nignorant and out of the way. By persevering effort in their behalf,\nwe must help them to become useful in the Lord\u2019s work. They will\nrespond readily to a patient, tender, loving interest.\nWe are to co-operate with the Lord Jesus in restoring the inef-\nficient and the erring to intelligence and purity. This work ranks\nequally in importance with the work of the gospel ministry.\u2014Medi-\ncal Ministry, 208, 209 (1905).\nAn Antitobacco and Temperance Message\nMan has Sold His Reason\u2014Satan is taking the world captive\nthrough the use of liquor and tobacco, tea and coffee. The God-\ngiven mind, which should be kept clear, is perverted by the use of\nnarcotics. The brain is no longer able to distinguish correctly. The\nenemy has control. Man has sold his reason for that which makes\nhim mad. He has no sense of what is right. Yet the liquor curse is\nlegalized, and works untold ruin in the hands of those who love to\ntamper with that which not only ruins the poor victim but his whole\nfamily.\nThe curse of liquor-drinking is demonstrated by the awful mur-\nders that take place. Intemperance is widespread. How much man\u2019s\nsenses are perverted by intoxicating drugs it is impossible to say.\u2014\nManuscript 11, 1899.\nAn Important Duty\u2014Years ago we regarded the spread of the\ntemperance principles as one of our most important duties. It should\nbe so today.\u2014Medical Ministry, 266 (1907).\nMethods for Presenting the Temperance Message\u2014The sub-[530]\nject of temperance should be strongly and clearly presented. Let the\npeople be shown what a blessing the practice of health principles\nwill be to them. Let them see what God designed men and women\nto become. Point to the great sacrifice made for the uplifting and\nennobling of the human race. With the Bible in hand, present the\nrequirements of God. Tell the hearers that He expects them to use\nthe powers of mind and body in a way that will honor Him. Show\nthem how the enemy is trying to drag human beings down by leading\nthem to indulge perverted appetite.\nClearly, plainly, earnestly, tell them how thousands of men and\nwomen are using God\u2019s money to corrupt themselves and to make\nthis world a hell. Millions of dollars are spent for that which makes\nmen mad. Present this matter so clearly that its force cannot but be\nseen. Then tell your hearers of the Saviour, who came to this world\nto save men and women from all sinful practices. \u201cGod so loved the\n480\nAntitobacco and Temperance Message 481\nworld, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth\nin Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d\nAsk those who attend the meetings to help you in the work\nthat you are trying to do. Show them how evil habits result in\ndiseased bodies and diseased minds\u2014in wretchedness that no pen\ncan describe. The use of intoxicating liquor is robbing thousands\nof their reason. And yet the sale of this liquor is legalized. Tell\nthem that they have a heaven to win and a hell to shun. Ask them\nto sign the pledge. The commission of the great I AM is to be your\nauthority. Have the pledges prepared, and present them at the close\nof the meeting.\nOne man should not try to do this work alone. Let several unite [531]\nin such an effort. Let them come to the front with a message from\nheaven, imbued with the power of the Holy Spirit. Let them draw\nwith all their strength, with words made eloquent by the Spirit\u2019s\nefficiency. Let them ask their hearers to assist in the work of warning\nthe cities. Let men and women be shown the evil of spending money\nin indulgences that destroy the health of mind and soul and body....\nNot by outward display, not by worldly patronage, is the kingdom\nof Christ established, but by the implanting of Christ\u2019s nature in\nhumanity through the work of the Holy Spirit. \u201cAs many as received\nHim, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to\nthem that believe on His name: which were born, not of blood, nor\nof the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.\u201d Here is\nthe only power that can work for the uplifting of humanity. And the\nhuman agency for the accomplishment of this work is the teaching\nand preaching of the Word of God.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1905.\nExperience in Helping Tobacco Users \u2014In Australia I met a\nman considered free from everything like intemperance, except for\none habit. He used tobacco. He came to hear us at the tent, and\none night after he went home, as he afterward told us, he wrestled\nagainst the habit of tobacco-using, and obtained the victory. Some\nof his relatives had told him that they would give him fifty pounds\nif he would throw away his tobacco. He would not do it. \u201cBut,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cwhen you present the principles of temperance before us\nas you have done, I cannot resist them. You present before us the\nself-denial of One who gave His life for us. I do not know Him now,\nbut I desire to know Him. I have never offered a prayer in my house. [532]\n482 Evangelism\nI have cast away my tobacco, but that is as far as I have gone.\u201d\nWe prayed with him, and after we left him we wrote to him and\nlater visited him again. He finally reached the point where he gave\nhimself to God, and he is becoming the very pillar of the church in\nthe place where he lives. He is working with all his soul to bring\nhis relatives to a knowledge of the truth.\u2014The General Conference\nBulletin, April 23, 1901.\nVictory Through Faith \u2014In this work all classes will be\nreached. When the Holy Spirit works among us, souls who are\nunready for Christ\u2019s appearing are convicted. Many come to our\nmeetings and are converted who for years have not attended meet-\nings in any church. The simplicity of the truth reaches their hearts.\nThe tobacco devotees sacrifice their idol, and the liquor drinker his\nliquor. They could not do this if they did not by faith grasp the\npromises of God for the forgiveness of their sins. The truth as it is\nin the Word comes before high and low, rich and poor, and those\nwho receive the message become workers with us and with God,\nand a strong force is raised up to labor harmoniously. This is our\nwork.\u2014Manuscript 3, 1899.\nMedical Evangelism in the Cities\nFrom City to City and Town to Town\u2014To all people, rich and\npoor, free and bond, Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, brought\nthe tidings of salvation. How the people flocked to Him! From far\nand near they came for healing, and He healed them all. His fame\nas the Great Healer spread throughout Palestine, from Jerusalem to\nSyria. The sick came to the places through which they thought He\nwould pass, that they might call on Him for help, and He healed [533]\nthem of their diseases. Hither, too, came the rich, anxious to hear\nHis words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from\ncity to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing\nthe sick\u2014the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, July 23, 1914.\nGod\u2019s Call Today\u2014God is calling not only upon ministers, but\nalso upon physicians, nurses, colporteurs, Bible workers, and other\nconsecrated laymen of varied talent who have a knowledge of the\nWord of God and who know the power of His grace, to consider the\nneeds of the unwarned cities. Time is rapidly passing, and there is\nmuch to be done. Every agency must be set in operation, that present\nopportunities may be wisely improved.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles,\n158, 159 (1913).\nA Door of Entrance to City Homes\u2014The medical missionary\nwork is a door through which the truth is to find entrance to many\nhomes in the cities. In every city will be found those who will\nappreciate the truths of the third angel\u2019s message.\u2014Counsels on\nHealth, 556 (1906).\nIn Every City Effort\u2014The principles of health reform are to\nbe promulgated as a part of the work in these cities. The voice of the\nthird angel\u2019s message is to be heard with power. Let the teachings\nof health reform be brought into every effort made to get the light of\ntruth before the people. Let workers be selected who are qualified to\nteach the truth wisely in clear, simple lines.\u2014Medical Ministry, 304\n(1910).\n483\n484 Evangelism\nFar Behind in the Work\u2014We are far behind in doing the work\nthat should have been done in these long-neglected cities. The work\nwill now be more difficult than it would have been a few years ago.[534]\nBut if we take up the work in the name of the Lord, barriers will be\nbroken down, and decided victories will be ours.\nIn this work physicians and gospel ministers are needed. We\nmust press our petitions to the Lord, and do our best, pressing for-\nward with all the energy possible to make an opening in the large\ncities. Had we in the past worked after the Lord\u2019s plans, many lights\nwould be shining brightly that are going out.\u2014Medical Ministry,\n301, 302 (1909).\nHealth and Temperance Messages to Masses \u2014There is a\ngreat work to be done in bringing the principles of health reform to\nthe notice of the people. Public meetings should be held to intro-\nduce the subject, and schools should be held in which those who are\ninterested can be told more particularly about our health foods and\nof how a wholesome, nourishing, appetizing diet can be provided\nwithout the use of meat, tea, or coffee....\nPress home the temperance question with all the force of the\nHoly Spirit\u2019s unction. Show the need of total abstinence from all\nintoxicating liquor. Show the terrible harm that is wrought in the\nhuman system by the use of tobacco and alcohol. Explain your\nmethods of giving treatment. Let the talks given be such as will\nenlighten your hearers. God has mercy on the unrighteous. This\nservice will be an opportunity to tell what health reform really is.\u2014\nLetter 343, 1904.\nSanitariums Near Important Cities\u2014The Lord has shown me\nthat there should be sanitariums near many important cities.... Suit-\nable places must be provided to which we can bring the sick and\nsuffering away from the cities, who know nothing of our people,\nand scarcely anything of Bible truth. Every effort possible is to be[535]\nmade to show the sick that disease may be cured by rational methods\nof treatment, without having recourse to injurious drugs. Let the\nsick be separated from harmful surroundings and associations, and\nplaced in our sanitariums, where they can receive treatment from\nChristian nurses and physicians, and thus they become acquainted\nwith the Word of God.\u2014Letter 63, 1905.\nMedical Evangelism in the Cities 485\nPlanting Bases for the Message \u2014It is the Lord\u2019s desire that\nrenewed efforts shall be put forth in many places, and small plants\nbe established. A work is to be done that is to open the way for the\nadvancement of the truth, and that will increase the faith of souls....\nThere are many fields to be worked, and calculations should not\nbe made to plant many large interests in a few favored localities.\nThe Lord has instructed me that we are not to make many large\ncenters; for in every field there should be facilities for the successful\ncarrying on of the work. For this reason a few large institutions\nshould not be allowed to exhaust all the income of means. In small\nand large cities, and in settlements that lie outside the cities, there\nshould be maintained small centers where faithful watchmen are\nstationed who will labor for souls. Wherever the missionary worker\ngoes, there should follow his efforts the establishment of some small\nplant that the advance of the work may be hastened. When God\u2019s\nservants do their work faithfully, Providence will open the way for\nthese facilities in many places.\nIn the highways and the byways efforts are to be put forth. We\nare not developing the work according to the best plans. We should\nplan to divide and subdivide our working forces, that we may work [536]\nnew fields. Letter 30, 1911.\nCities in Many Lands\u2014Medical missionary work is the right\nhand of the gospel. It is necessary to the advancement of the cause\nof God. As through it men and women are led to see the importance\nof right habits of living, the saving power of the truth will be made\nknown. Every city is to be entered by workers trained to do medical\nmissionary work. As the right hand of the third angel\u2019s message,\nGod\u2019s methods of treating disease will open doors for the entrance\nof present truth. Health literature must be circulated in many lands.\nOur physicians in Europe and other countries should awake to the\nnecessity of having health works prepared by men who are on the\nground and who can meet the people where they are with the most\nessential instruction.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 7:59 (1902).\nInstitutional Evangelism\nEstablished to Promote the Gospel Message\u2014To preach the\ngospel means much more than many realize. It is a broad, far-\nreaching work. Our sanitariums have been presented to me as\nmost efficient mediums for the promotion of the gospel message.\u2014\nManuscript 5, 1908.\nTo Bring Health to the Soul\u2014Some will be attracted by one\nphase of the gospel, and some by another. We are instructed by our\nLord to work in such a way that all classes will be reached. The\nmessage must go to the whole world. Our sanitariums are to help\nto make up the number of God\u2019s people. We are not to establish a\nfew mammoth institutions; for thus it would be impossible to give\nthe patients the messages that will bring health to the soul. Small[537]\nsanitariums are to be established in many places.\u2014Medical Ministry,\n327 (1905).\nTo Make the Gospel Attractive \u2014Those who are connected\nwith our sanitariums are to be educators. By pleasant words and\nkindly deeds they are to make the gospel attractive. As followers of\nChrist, they should seek to make the most favorable impression of\nthe religion they profess, and to inspire noble thoughts. Some will\nbe affected by their influence for time and for eternity.\nIn the work of helping others, we may gain most precious vic-\ntories. We should devote ourselves with untiring zeal, with earnest\nfidelity, with self-denial, and with patience, to the work of helping\nthose who need to develop. Kind, encouraging words will do won-\nders. There are many who, if a constant, cheerful effort is put forth\nin their behalf, without faultfinding or chiding, will show themselves\nsusceptible of improvement. The less we criticize others, the greater\nwill be our influence over them for good. To many, frequent, positive\nadmonitions will do more harm than good. Let Christlike kindness\nbe enjoined upon all.\u2014Medical Ministry, 208, 209 (1905).\nThe Great Objective\u2014The conversion of souls is the one great\nobject to be sought for in our medical institutions. It is for this that\n486\nInstitutional Evangelism 487\nthese institutions are established. The sick and the afflicted, coming\nto our sanitariums, are brought within reach of the gospel workers\nlaboring there. Oh, what precious opportunities are thus offered to\nsow the seeds of truth.\u2014Letter 213, 1902.\nPresenting the Message Judiciously\u2014Let the spiritual atmo-\nsphere of these institutions be such that men and women who are\nbrought to the sanitariums to receive treatment for their bodily ills [538]\nshall learn the lesson that their diseased souls need healing....\nSimple, earnest talks may be given in the parlors, pointing the\nsufferers to their only hope for the salvation of the soul. These\nreligious meetings should be short and right to the point, and they\nwill prove a blessing to the hearers. The word of Him who founded\nthe world in six days, and on the seventh \u201crested and was refreshed,\u201d\nshould be effectively brought before the mind....\nPublications containing the precious truths of the gospel should\nbe in the rooms of the patients, or where they can have easy access\nto them. There should be a library in every sanitarium, and it should\nbe supplied with books containing the light of the gospel. Judicious\nplans should be laid that the patients may have constant access to\nreading matter that contains the light of present truth....\nLet our sanitariums become what they should be\u2014homes where\nhealing is ministered to sin-sick souls. And this will be done\nwhen the workers have a living connection with the Great Healer.\u2014\nManuscript 5, 1908.\nWorkers Who Can Give Spiritual Help\u2014In our sanitariums,\nof all places in the world, we need soundly converted physicians\nand wise workers\u2014men and women who will not urge their peculiar\nideas upon the sick, but who will present the truths of the Word\nof God in a way that will bring comfort and encouragement and\nblessing to the patients. This is the work for which our sanitariums\nare established\u2014to correctly represent the truths of the Word of God\nand to lead the minds of men and women to Christ.\nLet the religious services held each day be short but educational\nin character. Present the Bible and its Author, the God of heaven and [539]\nearth, and Christ the Son, the great gift of God to the world. Tell the\npatients how the Saviour came to the earth to reveal the love of God\nfor men. Present before them His great sacrifice in thus coming here\nto live and die. Let it be known that through faith in Christ every\n488 Evangelism\nsinful human being may become a partaker of the divine nature, and\nlearn to co-operate with God in the work of salvation.\u2014Medical\nMinistry, 208 (1909).\nRemoving Prejudice\u2014The instruction given to the patients in\nour sanitariums is not to be presented in the form of laws that must\nbe obeyed. The word was spoken: \u201cEverything that can be done\nis to be done to bring the sick and afflicted to the way of truth and\nrighteousness. Medical missionary work is one means of doing\nthis. We do not know how much prejudice is removed as people\nare brought in contact with true medical missionary workers. As\nphysicians and nurses strive to do for the suffering the work that\nChrist did when He was upon this earth, the truth for this time will\nfind access to minds and hearts\u201d....\nThe evening seasons of worship at our sanitariums should be\nconducted in a way that will give opportunity for the asking of\nquestions.\u2014Letter 213, 1902.\nDoctrinal Questions\u2014The sanitarium parlor, where are gath-\nered a promiscuous crowd of patients, is not the place to talk upon\ndoctrinal subjects. Let our consistent lives win confidence and\nawaken a desire to know why we believe as we do. Then invite\nthose who inquire to attend the Sabbath meetings.\u2014Manuscript 53,\n1899.\nA Wise Restraint\u2014You have an important work to do in the\nsanitariums. In your work for the patients, do not allow them to\nreceive an impression that you are intensely anxious for them to\nunderstand and to accept our faith. It is natural that there should[540]\nbe an intense fervency to this end. But often a wise restraint is\nnecessary. In some cases the words that might seem appropriate\nwould do grave injury, and close a door that might have opened\nwider.\nManifest tender love, and exercise judicious forbearance. If you\nsee a good opportunity to make a sharp point in argument, it is better\noften to forbear. Do not on all occasions present the strongest proofs\nyou know; for this would arouse a suspicion that you were trying\nmerely to convert your hearer to the Seventh-day Adventist faith.\nThe simple Word of God has great power to convince of the truth.\nLet the Word speak and do its work. Let there be wise restraint in\nevangelistic effort. Do not force the presentation of a testing point.\nInstitutional Evangelism 489\nWait till inquiries are made. Let your example teach. Let the words\nand works show that you believe the words of the living Teacher.\u2014\nLetter 308, 1906.\nA Tactful Approach\u2014The living truth of God is to be made\nknown in our medical institutions. This does not mean that the\ndoctor or any of the workers are to introduce the truth to everyone.\nThat is not the way to do. The truth can be presented without doing\nthis. The nurses and workers are not to go to the patients, saying,\nWe believe in the third angel\u2019s message. That is not their work,\nunless the patients desire to hear, unless their objections have been\nremoved, and their hearts have been softened.\nAct so that the patients will see that Seventh-day Adventists are\na people who have common sense. Act so that they will feel that\nthe institution is a restful place. Bible truth is to be presented, but\nspecial points of the truth are not to be brought out before all the\npatients. If they ask you questions, give them the reasons of your [541]\nfaith. In this way light will shine forth.\nPatients may be asked to attend our meeting, and there they will\nhear the truth, knowing at the same time that it is not pressed upon\nthem. Then when they leave the sanitarium and hear people saying,\nI do not want to go there to be made a Seventh-day Adventist, they\nwill tell them that the workers at the sanitarium press the truth upon\nno one.\nIt will be impossible to keep patients from inquiring in regard to\nour faith. There are those who hunger and thirst for truth, and such\nones will find it. That is why we want our institution established at\nonce.\u2014Manuscript 111, 1899.\nThe Witness of a Consistent Christian Life \u2014These sacred\ntruths, believed and practiced, are not to be carried in any coercive\nmanner, but in the spirit of the Master. The Holy Spirit will reach\nnoble minds and the better spirit of men. In all our sanitariums there\nshould be men who understand the doctrine of truth and who can\npresent it by pen and voice. They will be brought in contact with\nmen of no mean minds, and they should plead with them as they\nwould plead with an only son. It should be our aim, saith the Lord,\nnot to put in responsible positions of trust men who are not fitted by\nexperience, men who do not take deep views of Bible truth.\n490 Evangelism\nMany suppose that appearance and style and pretense are to do\na great work in reaching the higher classes. But this is an error.\nThese persons can read these things. Appearance has something,\nyes, much to do with the impressions made upon minds, but the\nappearance must be after a godly sort. Let it be seen that the workers\nare bound up with God and heaven. There should be no striving for\nrecognition by worldly men in order to give character and influence\nto the work in these last days. Consistency is a jewel. Our faith, our[542]\ndress, and our deportment must be in harmony with the character of\nour work, the presentation of the most solemn message ever given\nto the world.\nOur work is to win men to belief of the truth, win by preaching\nand by example also, by living godly lives. The truth in all its\nbearings is to be acted, showing the consistency of faith with practice.\nThe value of our faith will be shown by its fruit. The Lord can\nand will impress men by our intense earnestness. Our dress, our\ndeportment, our conversation and the depth of a growing experience\nin spiritual lines, all are to show that the great principles of truth\nwe are handling are a reality to us. Thus the truth is to be made\nimpressive as a great whole and command the intellect. Truth, Bible\ntruth, is to become the authority for the conscience and the love and\nlife of the soul.\u2014Letter 121, 1900.\nNot Words, but Deeds\u2014In regard to making known our faith\nno decided effort should be made to conceal it, and no unwise efforts\nput forth to make it prominent. Persons will come to the sanitarium\nwho are in a favorable condition to be impressed by the truth. If\nthey ask questions in regard to our faith, it would be proper to state\nwhat we believe, in a clear, simple manner. Indwelling godliness\nimparts a power to the conduct of the true believer that gives him an\ninfluence for the right.\nBut in this matter we should act with discretion. There are\nconscientious persons who think it their duty to talk freely upon\npoints of faith on which there is a difference of opinion, in a manner\nwhich arouses the combativeness of those with whom they converse.\nOne such premature, injudicious effort may close the ears of one who\notherwise would have heard patiently, but who will now influence[543]\nothers unfavorably. Thus spring up the roots of bitterness, whereby\nInstitutional Evangelism 491\nmany are defiled. Through the indiscretion of one, the ears and\nhearts of many may be closed to the truth.\nIt is a fact that is known to all that the zealous religionists of\nthe different sects have cultivated and manifested very little can-\ndor in their estimation of those who differ with them on religious\nsubjects. Those of this class expect to meet the same unreasonable\nspirit among Seventh-day Adventists, and then put on their armor,\nprepared to resist anything that will reflect on their peculiar views.\nIn times past some in the sanitarium have felt it their duty to\nintroduce the Sabbath question in all places. They have urged it upon\nthe patients with earnestness and persistency. To such the angels of\nGod would say, Notwords, but deeds. The daily life tells much more\nthan any number of words. A uniform cheerfulness, tender kindness,\nChristian benevolence, patience, and love will melt away prejudice,\nand open the heart to the reception of the truth. Few understand the\npower of these precious influences.\u2014Manuscript 53, 1899.\nThe Consecrated Physician and the Missionary\nNurse\nChristian Physicians and Nurses\u2014The Lord has ordained that\nChristian physicians and nurses shall labor in connection with those\nwho preach the Word. The medical missionary work is to be bound\nup with the gospel ministry.\u2014Medical Ministry, 240 (1908).\nLuke an Example\u2014In our work today the ministry of the Word\nand medical missionary work are to be combined.\nLuke is called \u201cthe beloved physician.\u201d Paul heard of his skill[544]\nas a physician, and he sought him out as one to whom the Lord\nhad entrusted a special work. He secured his co-operation in his\nwork. After a time he left him at Philippi. Here Luke continued to\nlabor for several years, doing double service as a physician and a\ngospel minister. He was indeed a medical missionary. He did his\npart, and then besought the Lord to let His healing power rest upon\nthe afflicted ones. His medical skill opened the way for the gospel\nmessage to find access to hearts. It opened many doors for him,\ngiving him opportunity to preach the gospel among the heathen....\nIt is the divine plan that we shall work as the disciples worked.\nConnected with the divine Healer, we may do great good in the\nworld. The gospel is the only antidote for sin. As Christ\u2019s witnesses\nwe are to bear testimony to its power. We are to bring the afflicted\nones to the Saviour. His transforming grace and miracle-working\npower will win many souls to the truth. His healing power, united\nwith the gospel message, will bring success in emergencies. The\nHoly Spirit will work upon hearts, and we shall see the salvation of\nGod. In a special sense the healing of the sick is our work....\nThe lapse of time has wrought no change in Christ\u2019s parting\npromise. He is with us today as He was with the disciples, and He\nwill be with us \u201cunto the end.\u201d Christ ordained that a succession of\nmen should proclaim the gospel, deriving their authority from Him,\nthe great Teacher.\u2014Letter 134, 1903.\n492\nConsecrated Physician and the Missionary Nurse 493\nPublic Lectures by Physicians\u2014One who is a physician and a\nreligious teacher will find a work to do that will result in the salvation\nof souls. The form of sound words in religious teaching, sustained\nby a \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d will have a saving influence. A physician [545]\ncan so express himself that he will be invited to speak before various\ncompanies, and will be received. As a teacher, a physician can watch\nhis opportunities, for the Word of God is to go freely.\u2014Letter 4,\n1910.\nSingular Opportunities of Missionary Nurses \u2014In every\nplace where the truth is presented, earnest efforts should be made\nfrom the first to preach the gospel to the poor and to heal the sick.\nThis work, faithfully done, will add to the church many souls of\nsuch as shall be saved.\nThose who engage in house-to-house labor will find opportuni-\nties for ministry in many lines. They should pray for the sick, and\nshould do all in their power to relieve them from suffering. They\nshould work among the lowly, the poor, and the oppressed. We\nshould pray for and with the helpless ones who have not strength\nof will to control the appetites that passion has degraded. Earnest,\npersevering effort must be made for the salvation of those in whose\nhearts an interest is awakened. Many can be reached only through\nacts of disinterested kindness. Their physical wants must first be\nrelieved. As they see evidence of our unselfish love, it will be easier\nfor them to believe in the love of Christ.\nMissionary nurses are best qualified for this work; but others\nshould be connected with them. These, although not specially ed-\nucated and trained in nursing, can learn from their fellow workers\nthe best manner of labor.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:83, 84\n(1900).\nReaching the Higher Classes\u2014Physicians whose professional\nabilities are above those of the common worker, should be engaged\nin the service of God in large cities. They should seek to reach the [546]\nhigher classes....\nMedical missionaries who labor in evangelistic lines are doing\na work of as high an order as are their ministerial fellow laborers.\nThis kind of medical work, combined with ministerial work, is not\nto be limited to the poorer classes. The higher classes have been\nstrangely passed by. In the higher walks of life will be found many\n494 Evangelism\nwho will respond to the truth because it is consistent, bearing the\nstamp of the high character of the gospel. Not a few men of ability\nwill enter energetically into the work. Using their God-given talents,\nthey will be producers, as well as consumers.\nThe faithful physician and the minister are engaged in the same\nwork. They should work in complete harmony. They are to counsel\ntogether. By their unity they will bear witness that God has sent His\nonly-begotten Son into the world to save all who will believe in Him\nas their personal Saviour.\u2014Manuscript 79, 1900.\nSpiritual Ministry of Physician\u2014The work of the true medical\nmissionary is largely a spiritual work. It includes prayer and the\nlaying on of hands; he therefore should be as sacredly set apart for\nhis work as is the minister of the gospel. Those who are selected\nto act the part of missionary physicians, are to be set apart as such.\nThis will strengthen them against the temptation to withdraw from\nthe sanitarium work to engage in private practice. No selfish motive\nshould be allowed to draw the worker from his post of duty. We\nare living in a time of solemn responsibilities; a time when con-\nsecrated work is to be done. Let us seek the Lord diligently and\nunderstandingly.\u2014Manuscript 5, 1908.\nBalancing Cautions [547]\nOur Threefold Ministry\u2014God works by means of instruments,\nor second causes. He uses the gospel ministry, medical missionary\nwork, and the publications containing present truth to impress hearts.\nAll are made effectual by means of faith. As the truth is heard or\nread, the Holy Spirit sends it home to those who hear and read with\nan earnest desire to know what is right. The gospel ministry, medical\nmissionary work, and our publications are God\u2019s agencies. One is\nnot to supersede the other.\u2014Letter 54, 1903.\nAttach the Word \u201cMedical\u201d\u2014The work of the gospel ministry\nis not to decrease in efficiency, but is to increase until it becomes the\ngreat enlightening agency in our world. Everything possible should\nbe done to send more laborers into the field. No influence should\nbe exerted to turn young men aside from qualifying themselves\nfor ministerial missionary work. To this we may attach the word\n\u201cmedical\u201d; for it is essential that the gospel minister shall have a\nknowledge of disease and its causes. He should know how to give\nhelp to the sick. He should be able to teach the people how to treat\nthe house we live in. This is a part of the gospel.\u2014Letter 123, 1900.\nOur Work as Distinctive as Muller\u2019s\u2014God does not now lay\nupon His people the same work which was laid upon Muller. [George\nMuller, Bristol, England.] Muller did a noble work. But God has\ngiven His people a work to do after a different plan. To them He\nhas given a message for the whole world. They are to enter territory\nafter territory, and make aggressive warfare against soul-destroying\nsins.\u2014Letter 33, 1900.\nA Balanced Work\u2014for Rich and Poor \u2014Of late [1899], a [548]\ngreat interest has been aroused for the poor and outcast classes;\na great work has been entered upon for the uplifting of the fallen\nand degraded. This in itself is a good work. We should ever have\nthe spirit of Christ, and we are to do the same class of work that\nHe did for suffering humanity. The Lord has a work to be done for\nthe outcasts. There is no question but that it is the duty of some to\n495\n496 Evangelism\nlabor among them, and try to save the souls that are perishing. This\nwill have its place in connection with the proclamation of the third\nangel\u2019s message and the reception of Bible truth. But there is danger\nof loading down everyone with this class of work, because of the\nintensity with which it is carried on. There is danger of leading men\nto center their energies in this line, when God has called them to\nanother work.\nThe great question of our duty to humanity is a serious one, and\nmuch of the grace of God is needed in deciding how to work so as\nto accomplish the greatest amount of good. Not all are called to\nbegin their work by laboring among the lowest classes. God does\nnot require His workmen to obtain their education and training in\norder to devote themselves exclusively to these classes.\nThe working of God is manifest in a way which will establish\nconfidence that the work is of His devising, and that sound principles\nunderlie every action. But I have had instruction from God that there\nis danger of planning for the outcasts in a way which will lead to\nspasmodic and excitable movements. These will produce no really\nbeneficial results. A class will be encouraged to do a kind of work\nwhich will amount to the least in strengthening all parts of the work\nby harmonious action.\nThe gospel invitation is to be given to the rich and the poor, the [549]\nhigh and the low, and we must devise means for carrying the truth\ninto new places, and to all classes of people. The Lord bids us,\n\u201cGo out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come\nin, that My house may be filled.\u201d He says, \u201cBegin in the highways;\nthoroughly work the highways; prepare a company who in unity\nwith you can go forth to do the very work that Christ did in seeking\nand saving the lost.\u201d\nChrist preached the gospel to the poor, but He did not confine His\nlabors to this class. He worked for all who would hear His Word\u2014\nnot only the publican and the outcasts, but the rich and cultivated\nPharisee, the Jewish nobleman, the centurion, and the Roman ruler.\nThis is the kind of work I have ever seen should be done. We are\nnot to strain every spiritual sinew and nerve to work for the lowest\nclasses, and make that work the all in all. There are others whom we\nmust bring to the Master, souls who need the truth, who are bearing\nBalancing Cautions 497\nresponsibilities, and who will work with all their sanctified ability\nfor the high places as well as for the low places.\nThe work for the poorer classes has no limit. It can never be got\nthrough with, and it must be treated as a part of the great whole. To\ngive our first attention to this work, while there are vast portions\nof the Lord\u2019s vineyard open to culture and yet untouched, is to\nbegin in the wrong place. As the right arm is to the body, so is\nthe medical missionary work to the third angel\u2019s message. But the\nright arm is not to become the whole body. The work of seeking the\noutcasts is important, but it is not to become the great burden of our\nmission.\u2014Medical Ministry, 311, 312 (1899).\nA Proportionate Work\u2014The medical missionary work must [550]\nnot become disproportionate. It must be a work that is in order with\nthe rest of the work.\u2014Letter 38, 1899.\nHealth of Workers\u2014Those who put their whole souls into the\nmedical missionary work, who labor untiringly, in peril, in privation,\nin watchings oft, in weariness, and painfulness, are in danger of\nforgetting that they must be faithful guardians of their own men-\ntal and physical powers. They are not to allow themselves to be\novertaxed. But they are filled with zeal and earnestness, and they\nsometimes move unadvisedly, putting themselves under too heavy a\nstrain. Unless such workers make a change, the result will be that\nsickness will come upon them, and they will break down.\nWhile God\u2019s workers are to be filled with a noble enthusiasm,\nand with a determination to follow the example of the divine worker,\nthe great Medical Missionary, they are not to crowd too many things\ninto the day\u2019s work. If they do, they will soon have to leave the\nwork entirely broken down because they have tried to carry too\nheavy a load. My brother, it is right for you to make the best use\nof the advantages given you of God in earnest effort for the relief\nof suffering and for the saving of souls. But do not sacrifice your\nhealth.\nWe have a calling as much higher than common, selfish interests\nas the heavens are higher than the earth. But this thought should\nnot lead the willing, hard-working servants of God to carry all the\nburdens they can possibly bear, without periods of rest.\nHow grand it would be if among all who were engaged in carry-\ning out God\u2019s wonderful plan for the salvation of souls, there were\n498 Evangelism\nno idlers! How much more would be accomplished if everyone[551]\nwould say, \u201cGod holds me accountable to be wide awake, and to let\nmy efforts speak in favor of the truth I profess to believe! I am to\nbe a practical worker, not a day-dreamer.\u201d\u2014Medical Ministry, 292,\n293 (1904).\nSection 17\u2014Laboring for Special Classes [552]\nWorking for All Classes\nPreach the Truth to All Classes \u2014The gospel invitation is to\nbe given to the rich and the poor, the high and the low, and we must\ndevise means for carrying the truth into new places, and to all classes\nof people.\u2014Medical Ministry, 312 (1899).\nGive Them an Opportunity to Understand\u2014Let none receive\nthe idea that the poor and unlearned are to be neglected. Right\nmethods of labor will not in any sense exclude these. It was one of\nthe evidences of Christ\u2019s Messiahship that the poor had the gospel\npreached to them. We should study to give all classes an opportunity\nto understand the special truths for this time.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, November 25, 1890.\nA Saving Message for Every Soul\u2014Many have a deep sense\nof need\u2014a need that earthly riches or pleasures cannot supply; but\nthey know not how to receive that for which they are longing.\nThe gospel of Christ is from beginning to end the gospel of\nsaving grace. It is a distinctive and controlling idea. It will be a\nhelp to the needy, light for the eyes that are blind to the truth, and a\nguide to souls seeking for the true foundation. Full and everlasting\nsalvation is within the reach of every soul. Christ is waiting and\nlonging to speak pardon, and impart the freely offered grace. He is\nwatching and waiting, saying as He said to the blind man at the gate[553]\nof Jericho, \u201cWhat wilt thou that I should do unto thee?\u201d I will take\naway thy sins; I will wash you in My blood.\nIn all the highways of life there are souls to be saved. The blind\nare groping in darkness. Give them the light, and God will bless you\nas His laborers.\u2014Letter 60, 1903.\nPlans for the High Classes Will Reach All\u2014Bring your minds\nup to the greatness of the work. Your narrow plans, your limited\nideas, are not to come into your methods of working. There must\nbe reform on this point, and there will be more means brought in to\nenable the work to be brought up to the high and exalted position it\nshould ever occupy. There will be men who have means who will\n500\nWorking for All Classes 501\ndiscern something of the character of the work, although they have\nnot the courage to lift the cross and to bear the reproach that attends\nunpopular truth. First reach the high classes if possible, but there\nshould be no neglect of the lower classes.\nBut it has been the case that the plans and the efforts have been\nso shaped in many fields that the lower classes only are the ones who\ncan be reached. But methods may be devised to reach the higher\nclasses who need the light of truth as well as the lower classes.\nThese see the truth, but they are, as it were, in the slavery of poverty,\nand see starvation before them should they accept the truth. Plan\nto reach the best classes, and you will not fail to reach the lower\nclasses. Letter 14, 1887.\nConverted Talent and Influence \u2014God\u2019s servants are not to\nexhaust their time and strength in work for those whose whole life-\ntime has been devoted to the service of Satan till the entire being is\ncorrupted. As the outcasts come, and they will come, as they came [554]\nto Christ, we are to forbid them not. But God calls for workers to\nreach those of the higher classes, who, if converted, could in turn\nwork for those of their own standing. He desires to see converted\ntalent and converted influence enlisted in His work. The Lord is\nworking upon men and women of talent and influence, leading them\nto connect with those who are giving the last message of mercy to\nthe world.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1902.\nPaul\u2019s Methods Reached All Nations and People\u2014Paul in his\njourneys combined home and foreign missions. Now he is preaching\nto the Jews in their own place of worship. Now he is preaching to\nthe Gentiles, before their own temple and in the very presence of\ntheir gods. Nor does Paul proclaim to the Jews a Messiah whose\nwork is to destroy the old dispensation, but a Messiah who came to\ndevelop the whole Jewish economy in accordance with the truth.\nThose of the disciples who carried the word of truth the widest\nwere ready to stand the test of any interview with those who remained\nclose at home. Here Christianity obtained a decided victory, and the\nhigh, elevated stand was taken by the converted Jews that Christianity\nand salvation were for all nations, tongues, and peoples upon the\nface of the earth.\u2014Letter 17, 1900.\nReaching Men of Means and Influence\nGive the Call to Leaders in Business and Government\u2014The\ncall to be given \u201cin the highways,\u201d is to be proclaimed to all who\nhave an active part in the world\u2019s work, to the teachers and leaders\nof the people. Those who bear heavy responsibilities in public life,[555]\nphysicians and teachers, lawyers and judges, public officers and busi-\nnessmen, should be given a clear, distinct message.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 6:78 (1900).\nSeek Out the Influential \u2014Those who belong to the higher\nranks of society are to be sought out with tender affection and broth-\nerly regard. Men in business life, in high positions of trust, men\nwith large inventive faculties and scientific insight, men of genius,\nteachers of the gospel whose minds have not been called to the\nspecial truths for this time,\u2014these should be the first to hear the\ncall.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 230 (1900).\nWe talk and write much of the neglected poor: should not some\nattention be given also to the neglected rich? Many look upon this\nclass as hopeless, and they do little to open the eyes of those who,\nblinded and dazed by the power of Satan, have lost eternity out\nof their reckoning. Thousands of wealthy men have gone to their\ngraves unwarned, because they have been judged by appearance,\nand passed by as hopeless subjects. But, indifferent as they may\nappear, I have been shown that most of this class are soul burdened.\nThere are thousands of rich men who are starving for spiritual food.\nMany in official life feel their need of something which they have\nnot. Few among them go to church; for they feel that they receive\nno benefit. The teaching they hear does not touch the soul. Shall\nwe make no personal effort in their behalf?\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 6:78 (1900).\nWorkers of Intelligence to Reach Higher Classes\u2014There has\nnot been the effort made that should have been made to reach the\nhigher classes. While we are to preach the gospel to the poor, we\nare also to present it in its most attractive light to those who have\n502\nReaching Men of Means and Influence 503\nability and talent, and make far more wise, determined, God-fearing [556]\nefforts than have hitherto been made, to win them to the truth.\nBut in order to do this all the workers will have to keep them-\nselves up to a high level of intelligence. They cannot do this work\nand sink down to a low, common level, feeling that it does not much\nmatter how they labor or what they say, since they are working for\nthe poor and ignorant classes. They will have to sharpen up, and be\narmed and equipped in order to present the truth intelligently and\nto reach the higher classes. Their minds must rise higher, and show\ngreater strength and clearness....\nOne reason why efforts have not heretofore been made for the\nhigher classes as I have presented before you, is a lack of faith and\nreal courage in God.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1887.\nWith a Hook Properly Baited \u2014The intelligent, the refined,\nare altogether too much passed by. The hook is not baited to catch\nthis class, and ways and methods are not prayerfully devised to\nreach them with truth that is able to make them wise unto salvation.\nMost generally the fashionable, the wealthy, the proud, understand\nby experience that happiness is not to be secured by the amount\nof money that they possess, or by costly edifices, and ornamental\nfurniture and pictures. They want something they have not. But this\nclass are attracted toward each other, and it is hard to find access\nto them; and because of this many are perishing in their sins who\nlong for something that will give them rest and peace and quietude\nof mind. They need Jesus, the light of righteousness.\nThere is a certain round of labor performed in a certain way that\nleaves a large class untouched....\nThe rich left alone without any effort to save them become shut [557]\nup more and more to their own ideas. Their own train of thoughts\nand associations lose eternity out of their reckoning. They grow\nmore proud and selfish, hardhearted and unimpressible, suspicious\nthat every one wants to get money, while the poor are envious of the\nrich, who need pity rather than to be envied. Bring these all under the\npower of saving truth, and the work of the upbuilding of the kingdom\nof God will go forward with much greater success.\u2014Manuscript 66,\n1894.\n504 Evangelism\nCharmed by Scripture Truth\u2014Men in high positions of trust\nin the world will be charmed by a plain, straightforward, Scriptural\nstatement of truth.\u2014Letter 111, 1904\nAvoid Sharp Arguments \u2014Great men, learned men, can be\nreached better by the simplicity of a godly life than by all the sharp\narguments that may be poured upon them. Good impressions will\nbe given when religion is full of vitality which will give life and\nprogress. Where the precious seed of truth finds lodgment in the\nheart, through the workings of the Spirit of Christ the receiver will\ndiscover the sinfulness of human passions, vanities, ignorance. All\nthese must be cleansed from the soul temple and the grace of God\nbecome an abiding principle. Then all the principles of truth bloom\nin the garden of God\u2014humility, meekness, patience, and love.\u2014\nLetter 6b, 1890.\nPresent Truth in Figures and Parables \u2014The truth is to be\npresented in various ways. Some in the higher walks of life will\ngrasp it as it is presented in figures and parables.\u2014Medical Ministry,\n318 (1905).\nDrawn by the Simplicity of the Gospel\u2014Even the great men\nare more easily drawn by the simplicity of the gospel than by any\neffort made in human power. We need more of God and far less[558]\nof self. God will work through the weakest human agent who is\ncharged with His Spirit.\u2014Letter 72, 1899.\nThe Talent of Intellect and Means\u2014We are to do special work\nfor those who are in high positions of trust. The Lord calls upon\nthose to whom He has entrusted His goods, to use in His service\ntheir talents of intellect and of means. Some will be impressed by\nthe Holy Spirit to invest the Lord\u2019s means in a way that will advance\nHis work. They will fulfill His purpose, by helping to create centers\nof influence in our large cities. Our workers should represent before\nthese men a plain statement of our needs. Let them know what we\nneed in order to help the poor and needy and to establish the work\non a firm basis.\u2014Medical Ministry, 329 (1900).\nWork for Men Like Cornelius \u2014From the case of Cornelius\nwe may learn a lesson that we would do well to understand. The\nGod of heaven sends His messengers to this earth to set in operation\na train of circumstances which will bring Peter into connection\nwith Cornelius, that Cornelius may learn the truth. Through angel\nReaching Men of Means and Influence 505\nministration Peter is brought into cooperation with the inquiring\nsouls who have all things in readiness to hear the truth and receive\nadvanced light....\nThe conversion of Cornelius and his household was only the\nfirst fruits of a harvest to be gathered in from the world. From this\nhousehold a widespread work of grace was carried on in a heathen\ncity.\u2014Letter 17, 1900.\nThere needs to be a waking up among God\u2019s people, that His\nwork may be carried forward with power. We need the baptism of\nthe Holy Spirit. We need to understand that God will add to the\nranks of His people men of ability and influence, who are to act [559]\ntheir part in warning the world. All in the world are not lawless and\nsinful. God has many thousands who have not bowed the knee to\nBaal. There are God-fearing men in the fallen churches. If this were\nnot so, we should not be given the message to bear, \u201cBabylon the\ngreat is fallen, is fallen.... Come out of her, My people.\u201d\nThe gospel is to be proclaimed in our cities. Men of learning and\ninfluence are to hear the message. Not only white men but colored\nmen of ability are to accept the faith. These are to work for their\nown people, and they are to be supported in doing the work the Lord\ndesires to have done.\nMuch more prayer, much more Christlikeness, much more con-\nformity to God\u2019s will, is to be brought into God\u2019s work. Outward\nshow, an extravagant outlay of means, will not accomplish the work\nto be done. Many are gasping for a breath of life from heaven. They\nwill recognize the gospel when it is brought to them in the way that\nGod designs it to be brought.\nInto the busy world, filled with the din of commerce and the\naltercation of trade, where men were trying selfishly to get all they\ncould for self, Christ came; and above the confusion, His voice, like\nthe trump of God, was heard: \u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall\ngain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man\ngive in exchange for his soul?\u201d\nChrist points men to the nobler world, which they have lost out of\ntheir reckoning, and declares that the only city that will endure is the\ncity whose builder and maker is God. He shows them the threshold\nof heaven, flushed with God\u2019s living glory, and assures them that the\nheavenly treasures are for those who overcome. He calls upon them\n506 Evangelism\nto strive with sanctified ambition to secure the immortal inheritance.[560]\nHe urges them to lay up their treasure beside the throne of God.\nThen, instead of taxing themselves almost beyond endurance to gain\nearthly riches, they will work with all the powers of body and mind\nfor Christ. By using their talent of means to win souls to Him, they\nwill be doing a work of more importance than any other work in the\nworld.\nThere are among the monied men of the world those who will\nheed the message of warning: \u201cCharge them that are rich in this\nworld, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches,\nbut in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that\nthey do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute,\nwilling to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good\nfoundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on\neternal life.\u201d\u2014Letter 51, 1902.\nKings and Governors Must Hear\u2014The light is to be brought\nbefore kings and before the great men of the earth, although they\nmay receive it in the same manner in which Pharaoh received the\ntestimony of the servants of the Lord, and asked, \u201cWho is the Lord,\nthat I should obey His voice?\u201d\nKings, governors, and great men will hear of you through the\nreports of those who are at enmity with you, and your faith and\ncharacter will be misrepresented before them. But those who are\nfalsely accused will have an opportunity to appear in the presence of\ntheir accusers to answer for themselves. They will have the privilege\nof bringing the light before those who are called the great men of\nthe earth, and if you have studied the Bible, if you are ready to give\nan answer to every man that asketh you of the hope that is in you\nwith meekness and fear, your enemies will not be able to gainsay[561]\nyour wisdom.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 26, 1892.\nWarning National Leaders\u2014The rulers of the nations need to\nplant their feet upon the platform of eternal truth. They should not\nbe allowed, because of ignorance, to build their houses on the sand.\nThese men are not to be worshiped as gods. They are accountable\nto God for their course of action. To Him they must answer if they\nbecome a savor of death unto death to those who are under their\njurisdiction.\u2014Letter 187, 1903.\nReaching Men of Means and Influence 507\nThe Dangers of Prosperity \u2014In the history of men we learn\nhow dangerous is prosperity. It is not the men who have lost their\nmoney and their property who are in the greatest danger, but those\nwho have obtained a fortune and are placed in a high position. These\nneed careful, earnest labor. Adversity may depress, but prosperity\nelevates to presumption.\nPrayers are often requested for men and women in affliction,\nand this is as it should be; but the most earnest prayers should be\nsolicited for those who are placed in a prosperous position. These\nmen are in the greatest danger of losing the soul. In the valley of\nhumiliation we can walk securely, while we reverence God and make\nHim our trust. On the lofty pinnacle, where praise is heard, where\nour wisdom and greatness are extolled, we need a special power, a\nspecial arm to sustain us.\nThis is the light in which we should regard those not of our\nfaith. The men who are exalted and praised need greater help in\nthe simplicity of Christ than they receive. They need more earnest,\npersevering prayer, that they may be saved from destruction.\u2014Letter\n72, 1899.\nMinisters of Other Denominations[562]\nDraw Near to Ministers of Other Faiths \u2014Our ministers\nshould seek to come near to the ministers of other denominations.\nPray for and with these men, for whom Christ is interceding. A\nsolemn responsibility is theirs. As Christ\u2019s messengers, we should\nmanifest a deep, earnest interest in these shepherds of the flock.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 6:78 (1900).\nImportance of Working for Other Ministers \u2014The wisest,\nfirmest labor should be given to those ministers who are not of\nour faith. There are many who know no better than to be misled\nby ministers of other churches. Let faithful, God-fearing, earnest\nworkers, their life hid with Christ in God, pray and work for honest\nministers who have been educated to misinterpret the Word of Life.\nOur ministers are to make it their special work to labor for min-\nisters. They are not to get into controversy with them, but, with their\nBible in their hand, urge them to study the Word. If this is done,\nthere are many ministers now preaching error, who will preach the\ntruth for this time.\u2014Letter 72, 1899.\nWhy Should They Be Neglected?\u2014Much has been lost by our\npeople through following such narrow plans that the more intelligent,\nbetter-educated classes are not reached. Too often the work has\nbeen so conducted as to impress unbelievers that it is of very little\nconsequence\u2014some stray offshoot of religious enthusiasm, entirely\nbeneath their notice. Much has been lost for want of wise methods\nof labor. Every effort should be made to give character and dignity\nto the work.\nIt requires much wisdom to reach ministers and men of influence.\nBut why should they be neglected as they have been by our people?[563]\nThese men are responsible to God just in proportion to the talents\nentrusted to them. Where much is given, much will be required.\nShould there not be deeper study and much more prayer for wisdom,\nthat we may learn how to reach these classes? Should not wisdom\nand tact be used to gain these souls, who, if truly converted, will be\n508\nMinisters of Other Denominations 509\npolished instruments in the hands of God to reach others? ... If we\ncan win to Christ and the truth souls to whom God has entrusted\nlarge capabilities, our influence will, through them, be constantly\nextending, and will become a far-reaching power for good.\nGod has a work to be done which the workers have not yet fully\ncomprehended. Ministers and the world\u2019s wise men are to be tested\nby the light of present truth. The third angel\u2019s message is to be set\nbefore them judiciously, in its true dignity. There must be most\nearnest seeking of God, most thorough study; for the mental powers\nwill be taxed to the utmost in laying plans which will place the work\nof God on a more elevated platform. That is where it should always\nhave stood, but men\u2019s narrow ideas and restricted plans have limited\nand lowered it.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 25, 1890.\nNot All Will Accept Truth\u2014After the most earnest efforts have\nbeen made to bring the truth before those whom God has entrusted\nwith large responsibilities, be not discouraged if they reject the truth.\nThey did the same in the days of Christ. Be sure to keep up the\ndignity of the work by well-ordered plans and a godly conversation.\nDo not think you have elevated the standard too high.\u2014Letter 12,\n1887.\nSpeaking in Other Churches\u2014You may have opportunity to\nspeak in other churches. In improving these opportunities, remember [564]\nthe words of the Saviour, \u201cBe ye therefore wise as serpents, and\nharmless as doves.\u201d Do not arouse the malignity of the enemy by\nmaking denunciatory speeches. Thus you will close doors against\nthe entrance of truth. Clear-cut messages are to be borne. But\nguard against arousing antagonism. There are many souls to be\nsaved. Restrain all harsh expressions. In word and deed be wise\nunto salvation, representing Christ to all with whom you come in\ncontact. Let all see that your feet are shod with the preparation of the\ngospel of peace and good will to men. Wonderful are the results we\nshall see if we enter into the work imbued with the Spirit of Christ.\nHelp will come in our necessity if we carry the work forward in\nrighteousness, mercy, and love. Truth will triumph, and bear away\nthe victory.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1902.\nLaboring for the Middle Class\nA Group More Easily Reached\u2014Then there is another class\nmore easily reached. Many of them are more worthy than the wealth-\niest, for those who are rich have not all obtained their riches by the\nstrictest principles of integrity. There are those who would not sac-\nrifice principle or strict honesty to possess any amount of means.\nThis is the class that if the truth were presented to them in wisdom\nwould receive it, and be reliable workers together with God. The\nlaborer through the wisdom given of God will work in such a way\nas to draw these parties together in Christ Jesus.\u2014Manuscript 66,\n1894.\nHow Can We Reach Them?\u2014And how can we reach the com-\nmon people? Christ tried to work with the highest dignitaries of the\nnation. But they would not receive Him, because He told them the[565]\ntruth. They had exalted ideas of their own piety. They would not be\ninstructed. They thought their work was to instruct others, not to be\ninstructed themselves. But of the poor the Scriptures testify, \u201cThe\ncommon people heard Him gladly.\u201d \u201cThou, O God, hast prepared of\nThy goodness for the poor.\u201d \u201cThe Lord gave the word: great was the\ncompany of those that published it.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 125, 1897.\nChrist Met Their Minds\u2014We may do much in a short time if\nwe will work as Christ worked. We may reflect with profit upon His\nmanner of teaching. He sought to meet the minds of the common\npeople. His style was plain, simple, comprehensive. He took His\nillustrations from the scenes with which His hearers were most\nfamiliar. By the things of nature He illustrated truths of eternal\nimportance, thus connecting heaven and earth.\u2014Manuscript 24,\n1903.\nStudy Christ\u2019s Simplicity\u2014The Saviour came \u201cto preach the\ngospel to the poor.\u201d In His teaching He used the simplest terms and\nthe plainest symbols. And it is said that \u201cthe common people heard\nHim gladly.\u201d Those who are seeking to do His work for this time\n510\nLaboring for the Middle Class 511\nneed a deeper insight into the lessons He has given.\u2014The Ministry\nof Healing, 443 (1905).\nLord\u2019s People Mainly Common People\u2014The Lord\u2019s people\nare mainly made up of the poor of this world, the common people.\nNot many wise, not many mighty, not many noble are called. God\nhath \u201cchosen the poor of this world.\u201d \u201cThe poor have the gospel\npreached to them.\u201d The wealthy are called, in one sense; they are in-\nvited, but they do not accept the invitation. But in these wicked cities\nthe Lord has many who are humble and yet trustful.\u2014Manuscript\n17, 1898.\nIf God\u2019s Light Is Cherished\u2014There is no caste with God. He [566]\nignores everything of the kind. All souls are of value with Him.\nLaboring for the salvation of the soul is employment worthy of the\nhighest honor. It matters not what may be the form of our labor,\nor among what class, whether high or low. In God\u2019s sight these\ndistinctions will not affect its true worth. The sincere, earnest,\ncontrite soul, however ignorant, is precious in the sight of the Lord.\nHe places His own signet upon men, judging, not by their rank,\nnot by their wealth, not by their intellectual greatness, but by their\noneness with Christ. The unlearned, the outcast, the slave, if he has\nmade the most of his opportunities and privileges, if he has cherished\nthe light given him of God, has done all that is required. The world\nmay call him ignorant, but God calls him wise and good, and thus\nhis name stands registered in the books of heaven. God will fit him\nup to do Him honor, not only in heaven, but on the earth.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 332 (1915).\nWorking for Fallen Humanity\nFallen Humanity Our Field\u2014The indolent, the tobacco devo-\ntees, and liquor drinkers are many. But the truth must go to them. It\nhas worked wonders in this very place [Australia], and will still do\ngreat things. Our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in present truth\nmust not abide alone with those who receive Christ. Christ died to\nsave the world, and we are to work more zealously in acting our\npart. We are to look upon fallen humanity as our field. God cares\nfor them.... Not one soul is to be left in darkness.\u2014Letter 76, 1899.\nSome Degraded Rich to Be Saved \u2014Our large cities are fast[567]\nreaching the condition represented by the condition of the world\nbefore the flood, when \u201cGod saw that the wickedness of man was\ngreat in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his\nheart was only evil continually.\u201d God-dishonoring sins are practiced\nby people living in lordly homes; but some of these very people,\nunder the preaching of the last testing message, will be convicted\nand converted.\nFrom His inexhaustible store of grace, God can endow all who\ncome to Him. Looking upon humanity, fallen and degraded, He\ndeclares that the Holy Spirit shall be poured out upon all flesh.\nMany who have never heard the special truths for this time will feel\nthe conviction of the Spirit as they listen to the message of startling\nimportance....\nGod will raise up workers who will occupy peculiar spheres of\ninfluence, workers who will carry the truth to the most unpromising\nplaces. Men will say, \u201cYea,\u201d where once they said, \u201cNay.\u201d Some\nwho were once enemies will become valuable helpers, advancing\nthe work with their means and their influence.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 30, 1902.\nWork for the Fallen\u2014Nothing will or ever can give character to\nthe work in the presentation of truth as that of helping the people just\nwhere they are, as this Samaritan work. A work properly conducted\nto save poor sinners that have been passed by the churches will be the\n512\nWorking for Fallen Humanity 513\nentering wedge where the truth will find standing room. A different\norder of things needs to be established among us as a people, and in\ndoing this class of work there would be created an entirely different\natmosphere surrounding the soul of the workers, for the Holy Spirit\ncommunicates to all those who are doing God\u2019s service, and those\nwho are worked by the Holy Spirit will be a power for good in lifting [568]\nup, strengthening, and saving the souls that are ready to perish.\u2014\nManuscript 14a, 1897.\nTo Keep People From Becoming Abandoned\u2014We are to use\nour means and our talents of influence in proclaiming the truth that\nwill keep people from becoming abandoned. If we will take up the\nwork the Lord has given us to do, the truth will reach many of this\nclass in various ways. But we are not to neglect the lines of work\nthat the Lord has especially directed us to carry forward. All classes\nare to be reached.\nIf those who labor for the abandoned and fallen would work in\nthe fear of the Lord, striving to make those for whom they labor un-\nderstand what is truth, many of these outcasts would be distinguished\nas children of God.\u2014Letter 143, 1904.\nSelection of Workers for the Outcasts\u2014Great care should be\ntaken in working for the outcasts. Neither young men nor young\nwomen should be sent into the lowest places of our cities. The sight\nof the eyes and the hearing of the ears of young men and women\nshould be kept from evil. There is much that the youth can do for\nthe Master. If they will watch and pray and make God their trust,\nthey will be prepared to do various kinds of excellent work under\nthe supervision of experienced laborers.\u2014Medical Ministry, 312\n(1901).\nThe Stranger in Our Midst\nReaching All Nationalities, Ranks, and Creeds \u2014Christ rec-\nognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. The scribes\nand Pharisees desired to make a local and national benefit of the\ngifts of heaven, and to exclude the rest of God\u2019s family in the world.\nBut Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to[569]\nshow that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the\nlight, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.\u2014The Ministry of\nHealing, 25 (1905).\nStrangers in a Strange Land \u2014In the courts and lanes of the\ngreat cities, in the lonely byways of the country, are families and\nindividuals\u2014perhaps strangers in a strange land\u2014who are without\nchurch relations, and who, in their loneliness, come to feel that God\nhas forgotten them. They do not understand what they must do to\nbe saved. Many are sunken in sin. Many are in distress. They are\npressed with suffering, want, unbelief, despondency. Disease of\nevery type afflicts them, both in body and in soul. They long to find\na solace for their troubles, and Satan tempts them to seek it in lusts\nand pleasures that lead to ruin and death. He is offering them the\napples of Sodom, that will turn to ashes upon their lips. They are\nspending their money for that which is not bread, and their labor for\nthat which satisfieth not.\u2014Christ\u2019s Object Lessons, 232, 233 (1900).\nGod\u2019s Purpose for the Strangers in Our Land\u2014While plans\nare being carried out to warn the inhabitants of various nations in\ndistant lands, much must be done in behalf of the foreigners who\nhave come to the shores of our own land. The souls in China are no\nmore precious than the souls within the shadow of our doors. God\u2019s\npeople are to labor faithfully in distant lands, as His providence\nmay open the way; and they are also to fulfill their duty toward\nthe foreigners of various nationalities in the cities and villages and\ncountry districts close by.\nIt is well that those in responsibility are now planning wisely to\nproclaim the third angel\u2019s message to the hundreds of thousands of[570]\n514\nStranger in Our Midst 515\nforeigners in America. God desires His servants to do their full duty\ntoward the unwarned millions of the cities, and especially toward\nthose who have come to these cities in our land from the nations of\nearth. Many of these foreigners are here in the providence of God,\nthat they may have opportunity to hear the truth for this time.\nGreat benefits would come to the cause of God in the regions\nbeyond if faithful effort were put forth in behalf of the foreigners\nin the cities of our homeland. Among these men and women are\nsome who, upon accepting the truth, could soon be fitted to labor\nfor their own people in this country and in other countries. Many\nmight return to the places from which they came, in the hope of win-\nning their friends to the truth. They could search out their kinsfolk\nand neighbors, and communicate to them a knowledge of the third\nangel\u2019s message.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 29, 1914.\nA Means of Extending the Work to All Nations\u2014God would\nbe pleased to see far more accomplished by His people in the pre-\nsentation of the truth for this time to the foreigners in America than\nhas been done in the past.... As I have testified for years, if we were\nquick in discerning the opening providences of God, we should be\nable to see in the multiplying opportunities to reach many foreigners\nin America a divinely appointed means of rapidly extending the\nthird angel\u2019s message into all the nations of earth. God in His provi-\ndence has brought men to our very doors and thrust them, as it were,\ninto our arms, that they might learn the truth, and be qualified to\ndo a work we could not do in getting the light before men of other\ntongues.\nThere is a great work before us. The world is to be warned. The\ntruth is to be translated into many languages, that all nations may\nenjoy its pure, life-giving influence. This work calls for the exercise [571]\nof all the talents that God has entrusted to our keeping\u2014the pen, the\npress, the voice, the purse, and the sanctified affections of the soul.\nChrist has made us ambassadors to make known His salvation to\nthe children of men; and if we are clothed with the righteousness of\nChrist and are filled with the joy of His indwelling Spirit, we shall\nnot be able to hold our peace.\u2014The Review and Herald, October\n29, 1914.\n516 Evangelism\nWithin the Shadow of Our Doors \u2014The message must be\ngiven to the thousands of foreigners living in these cities in the\nhome field....\nWho feels heavily burdened to see the message proclaimed in\nGreater New York and in the many other cities as yet unworked?\nNot all the means that can be gathered up is to be sent from America\nto distant lands, while in the home field there exist such providential\nopportunities to present the truth to millions who have never heard it.\nAmong these millions are the representatives of many nations, many\nof whom are prepared to receive the message. Much remains to be\ndone within the shadow of our doors\u2014in the cities of California,\nNew York, and many other States....\nWake up, wake up, my brethren and sisters, and enter the fields\nin America that have never been worked. After you have given\nsomething for foreign fields, do not think your duty done. There is a\nwork to be done in foreign fields, but there is a work to be done in\nAmerica that is just as important. In the cities of America there are\npeople of almost every language. These need the light that God has\ngiven to His church.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 8:34-36 (1904).\nWe rejoice that the efforts put forth by the pioneer workers among\nforeign nationalities in the United States and Canada have borne a[572]\nrich harvest of souls.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 29, 1914.\nCity Bases for Foreign Work\u2014We drove out to see the newly\nestablished Swedish Mission on Oak Street [in Chicago]. There we\nwere shown a building which our Swedish brethren, under the lead-\nership of Elder -----, have recently purchased for the headquarters\nof their work in Chicago. The building presents a good appearance.\nIn the basement they have a well-equipped vegetarian restaurant.\nOn the first floor there is a pleasant, commodious hall for meetings,\ncomfortably seated for a congregation of about one hundred and fifty,\nand the two upper stories are rented to lodgers. I was indeed glad to\nsee this evidence of progress in the Swedish work in Chicago.\nThere is a great work to be done for the people of all nations in\nthe large cities in America, and such rallying points as this may be a\ngreat help in the matter of gaining the attention of the people, and\nin the training of workers. In every large city of America there are\npeople of different nationalities, who must hear the message for this\ntime. I long to see evidence that the lines of work which the Lord has\nStranger in Our Midst 517\nmarked out are being disinterestedly taken up. A work similar to that\nwhich is being done in Chicago for the Swedish people should be\ndone in many places.\u2014The Review and Herald, February 9, 1905.\nCareful Methods to Be Employed \u2014There is one man who\nhas been laboring in -----, ... and we labored with him, and sought\nmost earnestly to help him to take hold of the work, not as a fighter,\ncontending and debating, as was his habit, driving people away from\nthe truth rather than into it. He saw we talked the truth, not with\nstorm; not pelting the people with denunciations like hailstones....\nThis brother ... said he had received much light, and would labor [573]\nin altogether a different manner than he had done. The _____ are an\nexcitable people. They will bring every power to bear suddenly, and\nunder great excitement will exclaim, \u201cIs this so? What will you do?\nWill you keep the Sabbath? Say Yes or No\u201c! They are as sharp as a\nrazor, [and] cut off the ears of the people, ... and that is the end of\nthe business so far as converting them to the truth is concerned.\nNow we have to work with these men who are really intelli-\ngent, just as we worked with them one by one in the infancy of the\nSeventh-day Adventist work; separating from these precious souls\ntheir unsanctified ways and manners; talking to them about Jesus,\nHis great love, His meekness, His lowliness, His self-denial. These\nrough stones we bring if possible into the workshop of God where\nthey will be hewed and squared, and all the rough edges removed,\nand they be polished under the divine hand until they will make pre-\ncious stones in the temple of God and shall be living stones emitting\nlight. Thus they may grow up into a holy temple for God.\u2014Letter\n44, 1886.\nPublications in Every Language\u2014To giveall nations the mes-\nsage of warning\u2014this is to be the object of our efforts....From city to\ncity, and from country to country, they are to carry the publications\ncontaining the promise of the Saviour\u2019s soon coming. These publi-\ncations are to be translated into every language; for to all the world\nthe gospel is to be preached.\u2014The Review and Herald, February 9,\n1905.\nReaching Catholics\nGuarding Our Approaches\u2014We should not, upon entering a\nplace, build up unnecessary barriers between us and other denomi-[574]\nnations, especially the Catholics, so that they shall think we are their\navowed enemies. We should not create a prejudice in their minds\nunnecessarily, by making a raid upon them.... From that which\nGod has shown me, a great number will be saved from among the\nCatholics.\u2014Manuscript 14, 1887.\nA Cautious Work\u2014Be cautious in your labors, brethren, not\nto assail the prejudices of the people too strongly. There should be\nno going out of the way to attack other denominations; for it only\ncreates a combative spirit and closes ears and hearts to the entrance\nof the truth. We have our work to do, which is not to tear down but\nto build up. We are to repair the breach that has been made in the\nlaw of God. It is the nobler work to build up, to present the truth\nin its force and power and let it cut its way through prejudice and\nreveal error in contrast with truth.\nThere is danger that our ministers will say too much against the\nCatholics and provoke against themselves the strongest prejudices\nof that church. There are many souls in the Roman Catholic faith\nwho are looking with interest to this people; but the power of the\npriest over his charges is great, and if he can prejudice the people by\nhis stay-away arguments, so that when the truth is uttered against\nthe fallen churches they may not hear it, he will surely do it. But as\nlaborers together with God, we are provided with spiritual weapons,\nmighty to the pulling down of the strongholds of the enemy.\u2014Letter\n39, 1887.\nAvoid Unkind Thrusts\u2014Let not those who write for our papers\nmake unkind thrusts and allusions that will certainly do harm, and\nthat will hedge up the way and hinder us from doing the work that\nwe should do in order to reach all classes, the Catholics included.\nIt is our work to speak the truth in love, and not to mix in with the[575]\ntruth the unsanctified elements of the natural heart, and speak things\n518\nReaching Catholics 519\nthat savor of the same spirit possessed by our enemies. All sharp\nthrusts will come back upon us in double measure when the power\nis in the hands of those who can exercise it for our injury. Over and\nover the message has been given to me that we are not to say one\nword, not to publish one sentence, especially by way of personalities,\nunless positively essential in vindicating the truth, that will stir up\nour enemies against us, and arouse their passions to a white heat....\nIt is true that we are commanded to \u201ccry aloud, spare not, lift up\nthe voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d Isaiah 58:1. This message must be\ngiven, but while it must be given, we should be careful not to thrust\nand crowd and condemn those who have not the light that we have.\nWe should not go out of our way to make hard thrusts at the Catholics.\nAmong the Catholics there are many who are most conscientious\nChristians, and who walk in all the light that shines upon them, and\nGod will work in their behalf. Those who have had great privileges\nand opportunities, and who have failed to improve their physical,\nmental, and moral powers, but who have lived to please themselves,\nand have refused to bear their responsibility, are in greater danger\nand in greater condemnation before God than those who are in error\nupon doctrinal points, yet who seek to live to do good to others. Do\nnot censure others; do not condemn them.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 9:241-244 (1909).\nShutting the Door in Their Faces \u2014Preach the truth, but re-\nstrain the words which show a harsh spirit; for such words cannot\nhelp or enlighten anyone. The Echo is a paper that should be circu- [576]\nlated largely. Do not do anything that would hinder its sale. There\nis no reason why it should not be as a light shining in a dark place.\nBut for Christ\u2019s sake heed the admonitions which have been given\nin regard to making scathing remarks about the Catholics. Many\nCatholics read the Echo, and among the number there are honest\nsouls who will accept the truth. But there is such a thing as shutting\nthe door in their faces as they are about to enter. Put more cheering\ntestimonies of thanksgiving into the Echo. Do not hedge up its way,\nand prevent it from going to all parts of the world by making it a\nmedium for hard expressions. Satan rejoices when one word of\nbitterness is found on its pages.\u2014Counsels to Editors, p. 45. (1896).\n520 Evangelism\nExpose Fallacy by Presenting Truth\u2014Decided proclamations\nare to be made. But in regard to this line of work, I am instructed\nto say to our people: Be guarded. In bearing the message, make\nno personal thrusts at other churches, not even the Roman Catholic\nChurch. Angels of God see in the different denominations many\nwho can be reached only by the greatest caution. Therefore let us\nbe careful of our words. Let not our ministers follow their own\nimpulses in denouncing and exposing the \u201cmysteries of iniquity.\u201d\nUpon these themes silence is eloquence. Many are deceived. Speak\nthe truth in tones and words of love. Let Christ Jesus be exalted.\nKeep to the affirmative of truth. Never leave the straight path God\nhas marked out, for the purpose of giving someone a thrust. That\nthrust may do much harm and no good. It may quench conviction in\nmany minds. Let the Word of God, which is the truth, tell the story\nof the inconsistency of those in error.\nPeople cannot be expected to see at once the advantage of the[577]\ntruth over the error they have cherished. The best way to expose\nthe fallacy of error is to present the evidences of truth. This is\nthe greatest rebuke that can be given to error. Dispel the cloud of\ndarkness resting on minds by reflecting the bright light of the Sun of\nRighteousness.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1902.\nWe May Have Less to Say \u2014There is need of a much closer\nstudy of the Word of God; especially should Daniel and the Revela-\ntion have attention as never before in the history of our work. We\nmay have less to say in some lines, in regard to the Roman power\nand the Papacy, but we should call attention to what the prophets and\napostles have written under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. The\nHoly Spirit has so shaped matters, both in the giving of the prophecy,\nand in the events portrayed, as to teach that the human agent is to be\nkept out of sight, hid in Christ, and the Lord God of heaven and His\nlaw are to be exalted.\u2014Counsels to Editors, pp. 45, 46. (1896).\nPictured Truth Appeals to Catholics\u2014Elder S is arousing a\ngood interest by his meetings. People of all classes come out to hear,\nand to see the life-size images that he has of the beasts of Revelation.\nA great many Catholics come to hear him. Much of his preaching\nis in the words of the Bible. He uses as few of his own words as\npossible. So if his hearers war against what he says, they war against\nthe Word of God.\u2014Letter 352, 1906.\nReaching Catholics 521\nNone need to feel that the Catholics are beyond their reach.\u2014\nManuscript 14, 1887.\nA Large Harvest from the Jews\nJews Being Numbered With the Israel of God \u2014In this our\nday, we see the Gentiles beginning to rejoice with the Jews. There[578]\nare converted Jews who are now laboring in ----- and in various other\ncities, in behalf of their own people. The Jews are coming into the\nranks of God\u2019s chosen followers, and are being numbered with the\nIsrael of God in these closing days. Thus some of the Jews will once\nmore be reinstated with the people of God, and the blessing of the\nLord will rest upon them richly, if they will come into the position\nof rejoicing that is represented in the Scripture, \u201cAnd again He saith,\nRejoice, ye Gentiles, with His people.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 95, 1906.\nMany Will Come to the Light\u2014There is a mighty work to be\ndone in our world. The Lord has declared that the Gentiles shall\nbe gathered in, and not the Gentiles only, but the Jews. There are\namong the Jews many who will be converted, and through whom\nwe shall see the salvation of God go forth as a lamp that burneth.\nThere are Jews everywhere, and to them the light of present truth is\nto be brought. There are among them many who will come to the\nlight, and who will proclaim the immutability of the law of God with\nwonderful power. The Lord God will work. He will do wonderful\nthings in righteousness.\u2014Manuscript 87, 1907.\nThe Jews in Many Lands\u2014It has been a strange thing to me\nthat there were so few who felt a burden to labor for the Jewish\npeople, who are scattered throughout so many lands. Christ will\nbe with you as you strive to strengthen your perceptive faculties,\nthat you may more clearly behold the Lamb of God, which taketh\naway the sin of the world. The slumbering faculties of the Jewish\npeople are to be aroused. The Old Testament scriptures, blending\nwith the New, will be to them as the dawning of a new creation, or\nas the resurrection of the soul. Memory will be awakened as Christ[579]\nis seen portrayed in the pages of the Old Testament. Souls will be\nsaved, from the Jewish nation, as the doors of the New Testament\nare unlocked with the key of the Old Testament. Christ will be\n522\nLarge Harvest from the Jews 523\nrecognized as the Saviour of the world, as it is seen how clearly the\nNew Testament explains the Old. Many of the Jewish people will by\nfaith receive Christ as their Redeemer.\u2014Letter 47, 1903.\nConverted Jews in the Closing Work \u2014There will be many\nconverted from among the Jews, and these converts will aid in prepar-\ning the way of the Lord, and making straight in the desert a highway\nfor our God. Converted Jews are to have an important part to act\nin the great preparations to be made in the future to receive Christ,\nour Prince. A nation shall be born in a day. How? By men whom\nGod has appointed being converted to the truth. There will be seen\n\u201cfirst the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.\u201d The\npredictions of prophecy will be fulfilled.\u2014Manuscript 75, 1905.\nChild Evangelism\nChildren Ready to Hear and Accept \u2014In the children who\nwere brought in contact with Him, Jesus saw the men and women\nwho should be heirs of His grace and subjects of His kingdom,\nand some of whom would become martyrs for His sake. He knew\nthat these children would listen to Him and accept Him as their\nRedeemer far more readily than would grownup people, many of\nwhom were the worldly-wise and hardhearted. In teaching, He\ncame down to their level. He, the majesty of heaven, answered their\nquestions and simplified His important lessons to meet their childish\nunderstanding. He planted in their minds the seeds of truth, which[580]\nin afteryears would spring up and bear fruit unto eternal life.\nWhen Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come\nto Him, He was speaking to His followers in all ages,\u2014to officers of\nthe church, ministers, helpers, and all Christians. Jesus is drawing\nthe children, and He bids us, \u201cSuffer them to come\u201d; as if He would\nsay, They will come, if you do not hinder them.\nLet not your unchristlike character misrepresent Jesus. Do not\nkeep the little ones away from Him by your coldness and harshness.\nNever give them cause to feel that heaven would not be a pleas-\nant place to them if you were there. Do not speak of religion as\nsomething that children cannot understand, or act as if they were not\nexpected to accept Christ in their childhood. Do not give them the\nfalse impression that the religion of Christ is a religion of gloom,\nand that in coming to the Saviour they must give up all that makes\nlife joyful.\nAs the Holy Spirit moves upon the hearts of the children, co-op-\nerate with His work. Teach them that the Saviour is calling them, that\nnothing can afford Him greater joy than for them to give themselves\nto Him in the bloom and freshness of their years.\nThe Saviour regards with infinite tenderness the souls whom He\nhas purchased with His blood. They are the claim of His love. He\nlooks upon them with unutterable longing. His heart is drawn out,\n524\nChild Evangelism 525\nnot only to the best-trained and most attractive children, but to those\nwho by inheritance and through neglect have objectionable traits of\ncharacter.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 42-44 (1905).\nEarly Impressions Influence Later Life\u2014The lessons taught\nto children and youth make an impression upon their minds which [581]\ninfluences their characters in a far greater degree than older persons\nimagine. In my childhood a minister who came to my father\u2019s\nhouse at Poland, Maine, read the chapter in Acts in regard to the\ndeliverance of Peter, when an angel of God took the prey from the\nenemy who had determined to destroy him. The chapter was read\nslowly and solemnly, and it made an impression on my young mind\nthat has kept the narrative vividly before me to this day.\nNow from the light given me of God, I know that as a people\nwe have not improved our opportunities for educating and training\nthe youth. We should teach them how to read and understand the\nScriptures. Wherever there is a Biblical institute for ministers and\npeople, we should, in connection with it, organize a class for the\nyouth. Their names should be registered. All should feel the im-\nportance of the scheme of educating the youth to understand the\nScriptures. Let the work be taken hold of in the very simplicity of\nthe truth itself. Lead the minds of the youth from truth to truth, up\nhigher and higher, showing them how scripture interprets scripture,\none passage being the key to other passages. Thus the Scripture\nitself will be the educating power, holding the thoughts in captivity\nto Christ.\u2014Letter 27a, 1892.\nChildren\u2019s Meetings in Evangelistic Efforts\u2014The third angel\nis flying in the midst of heaven and bears on his banner the inscrip-\ntion, \u201cThe commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\u201d In every\nplace where the tent is pitched earnest efforts should be made from\nthe first to preach the gospel to the poor and to heal the sick. The\nwork of giving spiritual sight to the blind has added many souls to\nour number of such as shall be saved.\nMeetings for the children should be held, not merely to educate [582]\nand entertain them, but that they may be converted. And this will\ncome to pass. If we exercise faith in God we shall be enabled to\npoint them to the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the\nworld. All who attend our large gatherings are to be labored for. The\n526 Evangelism\nhigh and the low, the rich and the poor, are to be reached by this\nclass of labor.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1900.\nLove Wins Children to Christ \u2014By your manner of dealing\nwith the little ones you can by the grace of Christ mold their charac-\nters for everlasting life, or by a wrong course of action you can give\nthem the impress of a satanic character. Never act from impulse in\ngoverning children. Let authority and affection be blended. Cherish\nand cultivate all that is good and lovely and lead them to desire the\nhigher good by revealing Christ to them. While you deny them those\nthings that would be an injury to them, let them see that you love\nthem and want to make them happy. The more unlovely they are, the\ngreater pains you should take to reveal your love for them. When\nthe child has confidence that you want to make him happy, love\nwill break every barrier down. This is the principle of the Saviour\u2019s\ndealing with men; it is the principle that must be brought into the\nchurch.\u2014Letter 23a, 1893.\nWell-planned Effort for the Children\u2014The interest here [Aus-\ntralia] in our camp meeting exceeds anything we have ever seen in\nany meeting in America or in any other country. Right through\nthe holidays, with all their exciting amusements, we have had on\nweekdays as many as twelve hundred people at the tent\u2014earnest,\nintelligent people. Many children of outsiders come in. On last\nSunday there were about four hundred in attendance at the children\u2019s[583]\nmeeting. These meetings are under the direction of Sister _____. She\nhas the children arranged in classes under appointed teachers, whom\nshe instructs and assists in the work. The kindergarten methods are\nfollowed as far as possible....\nThe money spent in Gospel Wagons would have been far better\nused if invested in something solid and abiding. It is true that the\nGospel Wagons will accomplish some good. But I saw that there\nwould be disappointment as to the final results. In contrast with this,\nanother work was presented to my sight. Tents were being taken to\ndifferent places during suitable seasons of the year. Camp meetings\nwere being held in many localities. These were conducted by able,\nGod-fearing men, assisted by suitable helpers. Children\u2019s meetings\nwere held, and revival meetings, to bring the people to take their\nstand for the truth....\nChild Evangelism 527\nAt this camp meeting the very work that should be done has been\ndone. The children\u2019s meetings, or Bible kindergarten, has done a\ngood work. The lessons given are repeated by the children in their\nhomes, and the mothers show their interest by preparing the children\nneatly for the school. Most are children of parents not of our faith.\nThe seeds of Bible truth have dropped into the soil of the heart. It is\nno easy exercise, but it is doing good. Impressions are being made\nupon the hearts of parents and children. The good these meetings\nhave done the great day of God will reveal. This is a large field to\ncultivate. Let this work be carried on. Where can the talents be better\nused? These workers are sowing for a harvest.... Men, women, and\nchildren are anxious to know what they shall do to inherit eternal\nlife.\u2014Letter 2, 1899.\nNature Lessons\u2014Children\u2019s meetings were held twice a day. [584]\nAfter the morning lesson, on pleasant days, teachers and children\ntook a long walk, and during the walk, by the banks of the river, or\nin the grassy fields, a halt was called, and a short lesson from nature\ngiven. It was noticeable that on those days when the children had a\nramble in the fields, they were very quiet and orderly in the camp.\nThe attendance at the morning meetings when only the children of\nthe camp were present was thirty. In the afternoon when the school\nchildren from the neighborhood came in, there were from fifty to\nsixty.\u2014Manuscript 27, 1895.\nReaching Parents Through Children \u2014Our camp meetings\nare one of the most important agencies in our work. At every camp\nmeeting work should be done for the children. Let suitable workers\nbe constantly educating the children. Ask the blessing of the Lord\non the seed sown, and the conviction of the Spirit of God will take\nhold of even the little ones. Through the children many parents will\nbe reached.\u2014Manuscript 52, 1900.\nThose in the Tourist Centers\nWhy Jesus Chose Capernaum\u2014During His earthly ministry,\nthe Saviour took advantage of the opportunities to be found along\nthe great thoroughfares of travel. It was at Capernaum that Jesus\ndwelt at the intervals of His journeys to and fro, and it came to be\nknown as \u201cHis own city.\u201d This city was well adapted to be the center\nof the Saviour\u2019s work. Being on the highway from Damascus to\nJerusalem and Egypt, and to the Mediterranean Sea, it was a great\nthoroughfare of travel. People from many lands passed through the\ncity, or tarried for rest on their journeyings to and fro. Here Jesus[585]\ncould meet all nations and all ranks, the rich and great, as well as the\npoor and lowly; and His lessons would be carried to other countries\nand into many households. Investigation of the prophecies would\nthus be excited; attention would be directed to the Saviour, and His\nmission would be brought before the world.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 9:121 (1909).\nTo Arrest the Attention of the Multitude \u2014In the world-\nrenowned health resorts and centers of tourist traffic, crowded with\nmany thousands of seekers after health and pleasure, there should\nbe stationed ministers and canvassers capable of arresting the at-\ntention of the multitudes. Let these workers watch their chance for\npresenting the message for this time, and hold meetings as they have\nopportunity. Let them be quick to seize opportunities to speak to the\npeople. Accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit, let them meet\nthe people with the message borne by John the Baptist, \u201cRepent ye:\nfor the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d Matthew 3:2. The Word of\nGod is to be presented with clearness and power, that those who\nhave ears to hear may hear the truth. Thus the gospel of present truth\nwill be placed in the way of those who know it not, and it will be\naccepted by not a few, and carried by them to their own homes in all\nparts of the world.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:122 (1909).\nTent Meetings in the Great Resorts\u2014Tent meetings must be\nheld in as many of the great tourist resorts, far and near, as the __-\n528\nThose in the Tourist Centers 529\n___ Conference can work, with the laborers that they have. If ever\nthere was need of awaking to the importance of working in such\nplaces, it is now.\u2014Letter 138, 1902.\nWhere the People Are Coming and Going\u2014A special work is\nto be done in places where people are constantly coming and going. [586]\nChrist labored in Capernaum much of the time, because this was a\nplace through which travelers were constantly passing, and where\nmany often tarried.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 12, 1906.\nWorkers for Tourist Centers \u2014It is difficult to find capable\nyoung men and young women who can enter the cities and do effec-\ntive service. In these tourist centers where many travelers come for\nhealth and pleasure, we greatly need young men who are thoroughly\ngrounded in the truth of the third angel\u2019s message, to go around\namong the people, and minister to them, speaking a word in season\nto this one, and offering encouragement to another.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, July 12, 1906.\nThe Street Meeting\nReaching Some by Open-Air Meetings\u2014The cities must have\nmore labor. There are places where the people can best be reached\nby open-air meetings. There are many who can do this line of work,\nbut they must be clad with the whole armor of righteousness. We are\naltogether too delicate in our work; yet propriety and sound sense\nare needed.\u2014An Appeal for Missions, 15, (1898).\nProblems of the Moving Throng\u2014These [open-air meetings]\nmay be held at times, and on special occasions will be the best means\nof reaching the people; but to make this a regular manner of labor\nwill not at present secure the desired results. The laborer cannot\nmake full proof of his ministry. A chance speech or discourse may\nset minds on a train of thought which will, through other influences\nthat may be brought to bear upon them, result in their conversion;[587]\nbut these cases are rare.\u2014Gospel Workers, 339, 340 (1892).\nIn the open-air meetings there cannot be that complete work\ndone in binding off the work that he may present every man perfect\nin Christ Jesus. Sometimes great good may be done by this manner\nof labor. But as a practice it is better to reach the people in some\nother way.\u2014Letter 2, 1885.\nThe presentation of Christ in the family, by the fireside, and\nin small gatherings in private houses, is often more successful in\nwinning souls to Jesus than are sermons delivered in the open air, to\nthe moving throng, or even in halls or churches.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n193 (1915).\nOpen-Air Temperance Meetings\u2014We ought to be at work in\nthe dark corners of the earth.... I have frequently stood in the open air\nto speak to companies gathered to hear me. I have seen women with\nchildren in their arms standing for an hour to listen to me. There\nwere men and women all around me. I have asked them, \u201cHow\nmany of you have an intelligent faith in Jesus Christ? How many are\nChristians? Those who are, hold up your hands.\u201d Not a hand would\nbe raised. Did they not need Christ? Did they not need a knowledge\n530\nStreet Meeting 531\nof the truth? Did they not need to learn lessons of temperance?\nIndeed they did.\nGod wants us to stand where we can warn the people. He desires\nus to take up the temperance question. By wrong habits of eating\nand drinking, men are destroying what power they have for thought\nand intelligence. We do not need to take an ax and break into their\nsaloons. We have a stronger weapon than this,\u2014the Word of the\nliving God. That will cleave its way through the hellish shadow\nwhich Satan seeks to cast athwart their pathway. God is mighty [588]\nand powerful. He will speak to their hearts. We have seen Him\ndoing this. We have seen souls brought to the truth.\u2014The General\nConference Bulletin, April 23, 1901.\n532 Evangelism\nSection 18\u2014Dealing With False Science, [589]\nCults, Isms, and Secret Societies\nSatan Gains Foothold Through False Doctrines\nError Draws Its Life From Truth \u2014Satan has wrought with\ndeceiving power, bringing in a multiplicity of errors that obscure the\ntruth. Error cannot stand alone, and would soon become extinct if it\ndid not fasten itself like a parasite upon the tree of truth. Error draws\nits life from the truth of God. The traditions of men, like floating\ngerms, attach themselves to the truth of God, and men regard them\nas a part of the truth. Through false doctrines, Satan gains a foothold,\nand captivates the minds of men, causing them to hold theories that\nhave no foundation in truth. Men boldly teach for doctrines the\ncommandments of men; and as traditions pass on, from age to age,\nthey acquire a power over human mind. But age does not make error\ntruth, neither does its burdensome weight cause the plant of truth\nto become a parasite. The tree of truth bears its own genuine fruit,\nshowing its true origin and nature. The parasite of error also bears\nits own fruit, and makes manifest that its character is diverse from\nthe plant of heavenly origin.\nIt is through false theories and traditions that Satan gains his\npower over the human mind. We can see the extent to which he[590]\nexercises his power by the disloyalty that is in the world. Even the\nchurches that profess to be Christian have turned from the law of\nJehovah, and have erected a false standard. Satan has had his hand\nin all this; for by directing men to false standards, he misshapes\nthe human character, and causes humanity to acknowledge him as\nsupreme. He works counter to the holy law of God, and denies God\u2019s\njurisdiction. It is at his throne that every evil work finds its starting\npoint and obtains its support.\u2014The Review and Herald, October 22,\n1895.\nDiverging Paths of Truth and Error\u2014Satan\u2019s angels are wise\nto do evil, and they will create that which some will claim to be\nadvanced light, and will proclaim it as new and wonderful; yet while\nin some respects the message may be truth, it will be mingled with\nhuman inventions, and will teach for doctrine the commandments\n534\nSatan Gains Foothold Through False Doctrines 535\nof men. If there was ever a time when we should watch and pray in\nreal earnest, it is now. Many apparently good things will need to be\ncarefully considered with much prayer, for they are specious devices\nof the enemy to lead souls in a path which lies so close to the path of\ntruth that it will be scarcely distinguishable from it. But the eye of\nfaith may discern that it is diverging, though almost imperceptibly,\nfrom the right path. At first it may be thought positively right, but\nafter a while it is seen to be widely divergent from the way which\nleads to holiness and heaven. My brethren, I warn you to make\nstraight paths for your feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.\u2014\nManuscript 82, 1894.\nHeresies Now Presented as Bible Doctrines \u2014The time has\ncome when we cannot depend upon the doctrine which comes to our\nears, unless we see that it harmonizes with the Word of God. There\nare dangerous heresies that will be presented as Bible doctrines; and [591]\nwe are to become acquainted with the Bible so that we may know\nhow to meet them. The faith of every individual will be tested, and\neveryone will pass through a trial of close criticism.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, May 3, 1887.\nSatan Misquotes Scripture\u2014All should become familiar with\nGod\u2019s Word; because Satan perverts and misquotes Scripture, and\nmen follow his example by presenting part of God\u2019s Word to those\nwhom they wish to lead in false paths, withholding the part which\nwould spoil their plans. All have the privilege of becoming ac-\nquainted with a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord\u201d....\nThere are false shepherds who will say and do perverse things.\nChildren should be so instructed that they will be familiar with God\u2019s\nWord, and be able to know when part of a Scripture is read and part\nleft unread in order to make a false impression.\u2014Manuscript 153,\n1899.\nFallacies Introduced by Religious Leaders \u2014With the open\nBible before them, and professing to reverence its teachings, many\nof the religious leaders of our time are destroying faith in it as the\nword of God. They busy themselves with dissecting the Word, and\nset their own opinions above its plainest statements. In their hands\nGod\u2019s Word loses its regenerating power. This is why infidelity runs\nriot, and iniquity is rife.\n536 Evangelism\nWhen Satan has undermined faith in the Bible, he directs men to\nother sources for light and power. Thus he insinuates himself. Those\nwho turn from the plain teaching of Scripture and the convicting\npower of God\u2019s Holy Spirit, are inviting the control of demons.\nCriticism and speculation concerning the Scriptures have opened[592]\nthe way for Spiritualism and Theosophy\u2014those modernized forms\nof ancient heathenism\u2014to gain a foothold even in the professed\nchurches of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nSide by side with the preaching of the gospel, agencies are at\nwork which are but the medium of lying spirits. Many a man tampers\nwith these merely from curiosity, but seeing evidence of the working\nof a more than human power, he is lured on and on, until he is\ncontrolled by a will stronger than his own. He cannot escape from\nits mysterious power.\nThe defenses of the soul are broken down. He has no barrier\nagainst sin. When once the restraints of God\u2019s Word and His Spirit\nare rejected, no man knows to what depths of degradation he may\nsink. Secret sin or master passion may hold him a captive as help-\nless as was the demoniac of Capernaum. Yet his condition is not\nhopeless.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 258 (1898).\nError and Fanaticism in a Confused Ministry \u2014God calls\nupon His people to be Christians in thought, in word, and in deed.\nLuther made the statement that religion is never so much in danger\nas among reverend men. I can say that many who handle the truth\nare not sanctified through the truth. They have not the faith that\nworks by love and purifies the soul. They become accustomed to\nhandling sacred things, and because of this, many handle the Word\nof God irreverently. They have not walked in the light but have\nclosed their eyes to light.\nThis is an age of signal rejection of the grace God has purposed\nto bestow upon His people, that in the perils of the last days they\nmay not be overcome by the prevailing iniquity and unite with the\nhostility of the world against God\u2019s remnant people. Under the\ncloak of Christianity and sanctification, far-spreading and manifest[593]\nungodliness will prevail to a terrible degree and will continue until\nChrist comes to be glorified in all them that believe. In the very\ncourts of the temple, scenes will be enacted that few realize. God\u2019s\npeople will, be proved and tested, that He may discern \u201cbetween\nSatan Gains Foothold Through False Doctrines 537\nhim that serveth God and him that serveth Him not.\u201d\u2014Manuscript\n15, 1886.\nConflict Between False Science and Religion \u2014I have been\nwarned that henceforth we shall have a constant contest. Science,\nso-called, and religion will be placed in opposition to each other,\nbecause finite men do not comprehend the power and greatness of\nGod. These words of Holy Writ were presented to me: \u201cOf your\nown selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away\ndisciples after them.\u201d This will surely be seen among the people\nof God, and there will be those who are unable to perceive the\nmost wonderful and important truths for this time, truths which are\nessential for their own safety and salvation, while matters that are in\ncomparison as the merest atoms, matters in which there is scarcely\na grain of truth, are dwelt upon and are magnified by the power of\nSatan so that they appear of the utmost importance.\nThe moral sight of these men is diseased; they do not feel their\nneed of the heavenly anointing that they may discern spiritual things.\nThey think themselves too wise to err. Men who have not a daily\nexperience in the things of God will not move wisely in dealing\nwith sacred responsibilities; they will mistake light for error, and\nspecious error they will pronounce light, mistaking phantoms for\nrealities, and realities for phantoms, calling a world an atom, and\nan atom a world. They will fall into deceptions and delusions that [594]\nSatan has prepared as concealed nets to entangle the feet of those\nwho think they can walk in their human wisdom without the special\ngrace of Christ. Jesus wants man to see not men as trees walking\nbut all things clearly. There is only one remedy for the sinful soul,\nand unless it is received, men will accept one delusion after another\nuntil their senses are perverted.\u2014Manuscript 16, 1890.\nMiracles Not a Test\nSatan Will Present Miracles\u2014Many who refuse the message\nwhich the Lord sends them are seeking to find pegs on which to\nhang doubts, to find some excuse for rejecting the light of heaven.\nIn the face of clear evidence they say, as did the Jews, \u201cShow us\na miracle, and we will believe. If these messengers have the truth,\nwhy do they not heal the sick?\u201d ...\nCould their eyes be opened, they would see evil angels exulting\naround them and triumphing in their power to deceive them. The\nday is just before us when Satan will answer the demand of these\ndoubters and present numerous miracles to confirm the faith of all\nthose who are seeking this kind of evidence. How terrible will be\nthe situation of those who close their eyes to the light of truth and\nask for miracles to establish them in deception!\u2014Letter 4, 1889.\nMiraculous Healing and Fanaticism\u2014Our sanitariums are to\nreach a class that can be reached by no other means. \u201cWhy,\u201d asks one\nand another, \u201cis not prayer offered for the miraculous healing of the\nsick, instead of so many sanitariums being established?\u201d Should this\nbe done, great fanaticism would arise in our ranks. Those who have\nmuch self-confidence would start into action, as did certain ones in [595]\n_____, who had a great deal to say about holy flesh. These were\ncarried away by a spiritualistic delusion. At the General Conference\nin 1901 they were rebuked by a message given me for them by the\nLord. Should we carry out the plans that some would be pleased to\nhave us carry out, companies would be formed who would bring in\nspiritualistic manifestations that would confuse the faith of many....\nErrors will come in, and strange doctrines will be advocated.\nSome will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits\nand doctrines of devils. As far back as the establishment of the\nfirst sanitarium these things began to appear. They were similar to\nthe errors that manifested themselves soon after the disappointment\nof 1844. A strong phase of fanaticism appeared, calling itself the\n538\nMiracles Not a Test 539\nwitness of the Holy Ghost. I was given a message to rebuke this evil\nwork.\u2014Letter 79, 1905.\nFalse Sanctification and Holiness\nBeware of Doctrine \u201cJust Believe\u201d\u2014We shall meet with false\ndoctrines of every kind, and unless we are acquainted with what\nChrist has said, and are following His instruction, we shall be led\nastray. One of the most dangerous of these doctrines is that of false\nsanctification. There are those who claim to be holy, and yet are\nbreaking God\u2019s commandments. Their assertion that they are sinless\nis false and should not be received....\nAnother doctrine that will be presented is that all that we have to\ndo is to believe in Christ\u2014to believe that He has forgiven our sins,\nand that after we are forgiven, it is impossible for us to sin. This is a[596]\nsnare of Satan. It is true that we must believe in Christ. He is our\nonly hope of salvation. But it is also true that we must work out our\nindividual salvation daily in faith, not boastingly but with fear and\ntrembling. We are to use every power of our being in His service,\nand after we have done our utmost, we are still to regard ourselves as\nunprofitable servants. Divine power will unite with our efforts, and\nas we cling to God with the hand of faith, Christ will impart to us\nHis wisdom and His righteousness. Thus, by His grace, we shall be\nenabled to build upon the sure foundation.\u2014Manuscript 27, 1886.\nA Shallow Profession of Holiness\u2014Those who would follow\nChrist must be grounded upon the principles of truth. They need to\nunderstand what the Bible teaches in regard to faith, and sanctifica-\ntion through the truth. They must be so established in this knowledge\nthat they cannot be moved to take false positions on the doctrine\nof holiness, but will be able to illustrate in their lives the practical\nworkings of this heaven-given principle. The people of God must be\nable to distinguish between the genuine and the spurious.\nThere are those who profess holiness, who declare that they are\nwholly the Lord\u2019s, who claim a right to the promises of God, while\nthey do not render obedience to His commandments....\nIt is true that there are many who have never had the light of\npresent truth, who, through the grace given them of Christ, are\n540\nFalse Sanctification and Holiness 541\nkeeping the law as far as they understand it. Those who are thus\nliving up to the best light they have, are not of the class whom the\napostle John condemns. His words apply to those who boast of\nbelieving in Jesus, who claim holiness, while they lightly regard [597]\nthe requirements of the law of God. While they talk of the love of\nJesus, their love is not deep enough to lead to obedience. The fruit\nthey bear, shows the character of the tree. It proves that their faith is\nnot genuine. Yet this class, though entitled to nothing, though they\nhave no right to the promises of God, boldly claim all His blessings.\nWhile they give nothing, they claim everything. They close their\nears to the truth, refuse to listen to the plain \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d\nbut by professing holiness they deceive many, leading souls away\nby their pretentious faith that has no foundation.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n226, 227 (1892).\nFalse Doctrine\u2014It Makes No Difference What You Be-\nlieve\u2014There are many whose religion consists in theory. To them\na happy emotion is godliness. They say, \u201cCome to Jesus, and be-\nlieve in Him. It makes no difference what you believe so long as\nyou are honest in your belief.\u201d They do not seek to make the sinner\nunderstand the true character of sin....\nSatan is willing that every transgressor of God\u2019s law shall claim\nto be holy. This is what he himself is doing. He is satisfied when\nmen rest their faith on spurious doctrines and religious enthusiasm;\nfor he can use such persons to good purpose in deceiving souls.\nThere are many professedly sanctified ones who are aiding Satan\nin his work. They talk much of feeling; they speak of their love for\nGod. But God does not recognize their love; for it is a delusion of\nthe enemy. God has given these persons light, but they have refused\nto accept it. With the father of lies, they will receive the reward of\ndisobedience.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 26, 1900.\nAnother Error\u2014Commandments Done Away\u2014Christ warns\nHis followers, \u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in [598]\nsheep\u2019s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.\u201d He exhorts\nus not to be deceived when false shepherds present their doctrines.\nThese men tell us that the commandments of God were done away\nat the death of Christ. Shall we believe them, these men who claim\nto be sanctified, while they refuse to obey God? They say the Lord\n542 Evangelism\nhas told them that they need not keep the Ten Commandments; but\nhas the Lord told them this? No, God does not lie.\nSatan, who is the father of lies, deceived Adam in a similar way,\ntelling him that he need not obey God, that he would not die if he\ntransgressed the law. But Adam fell, and by his sin he opened the\nfloodgates of woe upon our world. Again, Satan told Cain that he\nneed not follow expressly the command of God in presenting the\nslain lamb as an offering. Cain obeyed the voice of the deceiver;\nand because God did not accept his offering, while He showed His\napproval of Abel\u2019s offering, Cain rose up in anger and slew his\nbrother.\nWe need to know for ourselves what voice we are heeding,\nwhether it is the voice of the true and living God or the voice of the\ngreat apostate....\nWhen type met antitype in the death of Christ, the sacrificial\noffering ceased. The ceremonial law was done away. But by the\ncrucifixion the law of Ten Commandments was established. The\ngospel has not abrogated the law, nor detracted one tittle from its\nclaims. It still demands holiness in every part. It is the echo of God\u2019s\nown voice, giving to every soul the invitation, Come up higher. Be\nholy, holier still.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 26, 1900.\nA Timely Caution\u2014We as a people have fallen into the opposite\nerror. We acknowledge the claims of God\u2019s law, and teach the people[599]\nthe duty of rendering obedience. We believe in giving everything,\nbut we do not see that we must take as well as give. We fail to have\nthat trust, that faith, which keeps the soul abiding in Christ. We\nclaim little, when we might claim much; for there is no limit to the\npromises of God.\nThrough a lack of faith, many who seek to obey the command-\nments of God have little peace and joy; they do not correctly rep-\nresent the sanctification that is to come through obedience to the\ntruth. They are not anchored in Christ. Many feel a lack in their\nexperience; they desire something which they have not; and thus\nsome are led to attend holiness meetings, and are charmed with the\nsentiments of those who break the law of God.\nIt is our duty to preach faith, to present the love of Christ in\nconnection with the claims of the law; for neither can be rightly\nunderstood without the other. In every discourse the love of God, as\nFalse Sanctification and Holiness 543\nmanifested in Christ, the sinner\u2019s only hope, should be dwelt upon\nuntil the people realize something of its power and preciousness. If\nthis is done as it should be, it will not be said of this people that they\nteach the law but do not believe in repentance, faith, and conversion.\nWe want these subjects to be blended as God has blended them;\nthen will the truth be presented in its completeness, not as a mere\ntheory, but as a power that will transform the character. It will then\nbe preached in demonstration of the Spirit and with power. Then\nthose who have accepted the doctrines of the Bible will not be unfed;\nthey will feel the vivifying influence of the Holy Spirit.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 227, 228 (1892).\nPantheistic and Spiritualistic Theories[600]\nThe Peril of False Science and Deceptive Theories\u2014In New\nHampshire there were those who were active in disseminating false\nideas in regard to God. Light was given me that these men were\nmaking the truth of no effect by their ideas, some of which led to\nfree-lovism. I was shown that these men were seducing souls by\npresenting speculative theories regarding God....\nAmong other views, they held that those once sanctified could not\nsin, and this they were presenting as gospel food. Their false theories,\nwith their burden of deceptive influence, were working great harm to\nthemselves and to others. They were gaining a spiritualistic power\nover those who could not see the evil of these beautifully clothed\ntheories. Great evils had already resulted. The doctrine that all were\nholy had led to the belief that the affections of the sanctified were\nnever in danger of leading astray. The result of this belief was the\nfulfillment of the evil desires of hearts which, though professedly\nsanctified, were far from purity of thought and practice.\nThis is only one of the instances in which I was called upon to\nrebuke those who were presenting the doctrine of an impersonal god\ndiffused through nature, and the doctrine of holy flesh.\nIn the future, truth will be counterfeited by the precepts of men.\nDeceptive theories will be presented as safe doctrines. False science\nis one of the agencies that Satan used in the heavenly courts, and it\nis used by him today....\nI beseech those who are laboring for God not to accept the spuri-\nous for the genuine. We have a whole Bible full of the most precious\ntruth. We have no need for supposition or false excitement. In the[601]\ngolden censer of truth, as presented in Christ\u2019s teachings, we have\nthat which will convict and convert souls. Present in the simplicity\nof Christ the truths that He came to this world to proclaim, and the\npower of your message will make itself felt. Do not present theories\nor tests that have no foundation in the Bible. We have grand, solemn\n544\nPantheistic and Spiritualistic Theories 545\ntests to present. \u201cIt is written\u201d is the test that must be brought home\nto everyone.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 21, 1904.\nFalse Theory\u2014God Is an Essence\u2014Already there are coming\nin among our people spiritualistic teachings that will undermine the\nfaith of those who give heed to them. The theory that God is an\nessence pervading all nature, is one of Satan\u2019s most subtle devices.\nIt misrepresents God, and is a dishonor to His greatness and majesty.\nPantheistic theories are not sustained by the Word of God. The\nlight of His truth shows that these theories are soul-destroying agen-\ncies. Darkness is their element, sensuality their sphere. They gratify\nthe natural heart, and give license to inclination. Separation from\nGod is the result of accepting them....\nThere is but one power that can break the hold of evil from the\nhearts of men, and that is the power of God in Jesus Christ. Only\nthrough the blood of the Crucified One is there cleansing from sin.\nHis grace alone can enable us to resist and subdue the tendencies of\nour fallen nature. This power the spiritualistic theories concerning\nGod make of no effect. If God is an essence pervading all nature,\nthen He dwells in all men; and in order to attain holiness, man has\nonly to develop the power that is within him.\nThese theories, followed to their logical conclusion, sweep away\nthe whole Christian economy. They do away with the necessity [602]\nfor the atonement, and make man his own savior. These theories\nregarding God make His Word of no effect, and those who accept\nthem are in great danger of being led finally to look upon the whole\nBible as a fiction. They may regard virtue as better than vice; but\nGod being removed from His position of sovereignty, they place their\ndependence upon human power, which, without God, is worthless.\nThe unaided human will has no real power to resist and overcome\nevil. The defenses of the soul are broken down. Man has no barrier\nagainst sin. When once the restraints of God\u2019s Word and His Spirit\nare rejected, we know not to what depths one may sink.\nThose who continue to hold these spiritualistic theories will\nsurely spoil their Christian experience, sever their connection with\nGod, and lose eternal life.\nThe sophistries regarding God and nature that are flooding the\nworld with skepticism are the inspiration of the fallen foe, who is\nhimself a Bible student, who knows the truth that it is essential for\n546 Evangelism\nthe people to receive, and whose study it is to divert minds from\nthe great truths given to prepare them for what is coming upon the\nworld.\nI have seen the results of these fanciful views of God, in apostasy,\nspiritualism, and free-lovism. The free-love tendency of these teach-\nings was so concealed that at first it was difficult to make plain its real\ncharacter. Until the Lord presented it to me, I knew not what to call\nit, but I was instructed to call it unholy spiritual love.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 8:291, 292 (1904).\nVarious Forms of Spiritualism\nAbout to Take World Captive\u2014Spiritualism is about to take\nthe world captive. There are many who think that Spiritualism is [603]\nupheld through trickery and imposture, but this is far from the truth.\nSuperhuman power is working in a variety of ways, and few have\nany idea as to what will be the manifestations of Spiritualism in the\nfuture. The foundation for the success of Spiritualism has been laid\nin the assertions that have been made from the pulpits of our land.\nThe ministers have proclaimed as Bible doctrines falsehoods that\nhave originated with the arch deceiver.\nThe doctrine of consciousness after death, of the spirits of the\ndead being in communion with the living, has no foundation in the\nScriptures, and yet these theories are affirmed as truth. Through this\nfalse doctrine the way has been opened for the spirits of devils to\ndeceive the people in representing themselves as the dead. Satanic\nagencies personate the dead and thus bring souls into captivity.\nSatan has a religion, he has a synagogue and devout worshipers. To\nswell the ranks of his devotees, he uses all manner of deception.\u2014\nManuscript 92, 1894.\nA Deception Aimed at the Bereaved \u2014The deification of the\ndead has held a prominent place in nearly every system of hea-\nthenism, as has also the supposed communion with the dead. The\ngods were believed to communicate their will to men, and also, when\nconsulted, to give them counsel. Of this character were the famous\noracles of Greece and Rome.\nThe belief in communion with the dead is still held, even in\nprofessedly Christian lands. Under the name of Spiritualism, the\npractice of communicating with beings claiming to be the spirits of\nthe departed, has become widespread. It is calculated to take hold\nof the sympathies of those who have laid their loved ones in the\ngrave.\u2014The Signs of the Times, June 23, 1890.\nLaying the Foundation for Spiritism\u2014He [Satan] sometimes [604]\ncomes in the form of a lovely young person, or of a beautiful shadow.\n547\n548 Evangelism\nHe works cures, and is worshiped by deceived mortals as a bene-\nfactor of our race.... Thousands are conversing with, and receiving\ninstructions from, this demon-god, and acting according to his teach-\nings. The world, which is supposed to be benefited so much by\nphrenology and animal magnetism, never was so corrupt. Satan\nuses these very things to destroy virtue and lay the foundation of\nSpiritualism.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:296, 297 (1862).\nMore Frequent and Startling Manifestations \u2014Spiritualists\nare increasing in numbers. They will come to men who have the\ntruth as Satan came to Christ, tempting them to manifest their power\nand work miracles, and give evidence of their being favored of God,\nand of their being the people who have the truth.... The only safety\nfor the people of God is to be thoroughly conversant with their\nBibles, and be intelligent upon the reasons of our faith in regard to\nthe sleep of the dead.\nSatan is a cunning foe. And it is not difficult for the evil angels\nto represent both saints and sinners who have died, and make these\nrepresentations visible to human eyes. These manifestations will be\nmore frequent, and developments of a more startling character will\nappear as we near the close of time.\u2014The Review and Herald, April\n1, 1875.\nMinisters Dress It Up \u2014Ministers inspired of Satan can elo-\nquently dress up this hideous monster, hide its deformity, and make\nit appear beautiful to many. But it comes so direct from his satanic\nmajesty, that all who have to do with it, he claims as his to control,\nfor they have ventured upon forbidden ground, and have forfeited[605]\nthe protection of their Maker.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 13,\n1862.\nSpiritism and Cultism Debase Minds \u2014Thousands, I was\nshown, have been spoiled through the philosophy of phrenology\nand animal magnetism, and have been driven into infidelity. If the\nmind commences to run in this channel, it is almost sure to lose its\nbalance and be controlled by a demon.\n\u201cVain deceit\u201d fills the minds of poor mortals. They think there\nis such power in themselves to accomplish great works, that they\nrealize no necessity of a higher power. Their principles and faith are\n\u201cafter the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not\nafter Christ.\u201d Jesus has not taught them this philosophy. Nothing of\nVarious Forms of Spiritualism 549\nthe kind can be found in His teachings. He did not direct the minds\nof poor mortals to themselves, to a power which they possessed. He\nwas ever directing their minds to God, the Creator of the universe,\nas the source of their strength and wisdom....\nThe teachers of Spiritualism come in a pleasing, bewitching\nmanner to deceive you, and if you listen to their fables you are\nbeguiled by the enemy of righteousness, and will surely lose your\nreward. When once the fascinating influence of the arch-deceiver\novercomes you, you are poisoned, and its deadly influence adulter-\nates and destroys your faith in Christ\u2019s being the Son of God, and\nyou cease to rely on the merits of His blood. Those deceived by this\nphilosophy are beguiled of their reward through the deceptions of\nSatan. They rely upon their own merits, exercise voluntary humility,\nare even willing to make sacrifices, and debase themselves, and\nyield their minds to the belief of supreme nonsense, receiving the\nmost absurd ideas through those whom they believe to be their dead [606]\nfriends. Satan has so blinded their eyes and perverted their judgment\nthat they perceive not the evil; and they follow out the instructions\npurporting to be from their dead friends, now angels in a higher\nsphere.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:297, 298 (1862).\nChristian Science, Oriental and Healing Cults \u2014There are\nmany who shrink with horror from the thought of consulting spirit\nmediums, but who are attracted by more pleasing forms of spiritism,\nsuch as the Emmanuel movement. Still others are led astray by the\nteachings of Christian Science, and by the mysticism of theosophy\nand other Oriental religions.\nThe apostles of nearly all forms of spiritism claim to have the\npower to cure the diseased. They attribute their power to electricity,\nmagnetism, the so-called \u201csympathetic remedies,\u201d or to latent forces\nwithin the mind of man. And there are not a few, even in this\nChristian age, who go to these healers, instead of trusting in the\npower of the living God and the skill of well-qualified Christian\nphysicians.\nThe mother, watching by the sickbed of her child, exclaims, \u201cI\ncan do no more! Is there no physician who has power to restore my\nchild!\u201d She is told of the wonderful cures performed by some clair-\nvoyant or magnetic healer, and she trusts her dear one to his charge,\nplacing it as verily in the hand of Satan as if he were standing by her\n550 Evangelism\nside. In many instances the future life of the child is controlled by\na satanic power, which it seems impossible to break.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, January 15, 1914.\nDeceptive Benefits\u2014Those who give themselves up to the sor-\ncery of Satan, may boast of great benefit received, but does this prove\ntheir course to be wise or safe? What if life should be prolonged?\nWhat if temporal gain should be secured? Will it pay in the end to[607]\nhave disregarded the will of God? All such apparent gain will prove\nat last an irrecoverable loss. We cannot with impunity break down\na single barrier which God has erected to guard His people from\nSatan\u2019s power.\u2014The Review and Herald, January 15, 1914.\nDanger in Consulting Cultist Physicians \u2014There is danger\nin departing in the least from the Lord\u2019s instruction. When we\ndeviate from the plain path of duty, a train of circumstances will\narise that seem irresistibly to draw us farther and farther from the\nright. Needless intimacies with those who have no respect for God\nwill seduce us, ere we are aware. Fear to offend worldly friends will\ndeter us from expressing our gratitude to God or acknowledging our\ndependence upon Him....\nAngels of God will preserve His people while they walk in\nthe path of duty; but there is no assurance of such protection for\nthose who deliberately venture upon Satan\u2019s ground. An agent of\nthe great deceiver will say and do anything to gain his object. It\nmatters little whether he calls himself a spiritualist, an \u201celectric\nphysician,\u201d or a \u201cmagnetic healer.\u201d By specious pretenses he wins\nthe confidence of the unwary. He pretends to read the life-history\nand to understand all the difficulties and afflictions of those who\nresort to him. Disguising himself as an angel of light, while the\nblackness of the pit is in his heart, he manifests great interest in\nwomen who seek his counsel. He tells them that all their troubles\nare due to an unhappy marriage. This may be too true, but such a\ncounselor does not better their condition. He tells them that they\nneed love and sympathy. Pretending great interest in their welfare,\nhe casts a spell over his unsuspecting victims, charming them as\nthe serpent charms the trembling bird. Soon they are completely in [608]\nhis power, and sin, disgrace, and ruin are the terrible sequel.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, June 27, 1882.\nVarious Forms of Spiritualism 551\nVilest License, Despair, and Ruin\u2014The demon\u2019s message to\nSaul, although it was a denunciation of sin and a prophecy of retri-\nbution, was not meant to reform him, but to goad him to despair and\nruin. Oftener, however, it serves the tempter\u2019s purpose best to lure\nmen to destruction by flattery. The teaching of the demon-gods, in\nancient times, fostered the vilest license. The divine precepts con-\ndemning sin and enforcing righteousness, were set aside; truth was\nlightly regarded, and impurity was not only permitted, but enjoined.\nSpiritualism declares that there is no death, no sin, no judgment,\nno retribution; that \u201cmen are unfallen demigods\u201d; that desire is the\nhighest law; and that man is accountable only to himself. The bar-\nriers that God has erected to guard truth, purity, and reverence, are\nbroken down, and many are thus emboldened in sin. Does not such\nteaching suggest an origin similar to that of demon worship?\u2014The\nSigns of the Times, June 30, 1890.\nMystic Voices, Mediums, Clairvoyants, and Fortune-\ntellers\u2014The mystic voices that spoke at Ekron and Endor are still,\nby their lying words, misleading the children of men. The prince of\ndarkness has but appeared under a new guise. The heathen oracles\nof ages long past have their counterpart in the spiritualistic medi-\nums, the clairvoyants and fortune tellers of today. The mysteries of\nheathen worship are replaced by the secret associations and seances,\nthe obscurities and wonders, of the sorcerers of our time. And their\ndisclosures are eagerly received by thousands who refuse to accept\nlight from the Word or the Spirit of God. They speak with scorn of\nthe magicians of old, while the great deceiver laughs in triumph as [609]\nthey yield to his arts under a different form.\nThese Satanic agents claim to cure disease. They attribute their\npower to electricity, magnetism, or the so-called \u201csympathetic reme-\ndies,\u201d while in truth they are but channels for Satan\u2019s electric cur-\nrents. By this means he casts his spell over the bodies and souls of\nmen.\u2014The Signs of the Times, March 24, 1887.\nThe Path to Hell\u2014Vain philosophy is employed in representing\nthe path to hell as a path of safety. With the imagination highly\nwrought, and voices musically tuned, they picture the broad road as\none of happiness and glory. Ambition holds before deluded souls,\nas Satan presented to Eve, a freedom and bliss for them to enjoy\nwhich they never conceived was possible. Men are praised who\n552 Evangelism\nhave traveled the broad path to hell, and after they die are exalted\nto the highest positions in the eternal world. Satan, clothed in robes\nof brightness, appearing like an exalted angel, tempted the world\u2019s\nRedeemer without success. But as he comes to man robed as an\nangel of light, he has better success. He covers his hideous purposes,\nand succeeds too well in deluding the unwary who are not firmly\nanchored upon eternal truth.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 1,\n1875.\nThe Power of Prayer in Meeting Satan\u2014The prayer of faith\nis the great strength of the Christian, and will assuredly prevail\nagainst Satan. This is why he insinuates that we have no need of\nprayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests; and when we\nearnestly come to Him for help, Satan\u2019s host is alarmed. It serves his\npurpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for then his lying\nwonders are more readily received.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n1:296 (1862).\nFanaticism and Extremism [610]\nCounterfeiting Spiritual Gifts \u2014Many errors arose, and\nthough I was then little more than a child, I was sent by the Lord\nfrom place to place to rebuke those who were holding these false\ndoctrines. There were those who were in danger of going into fa-\nnaticism, and I was bidden in the name of the Lord to give them a\nwarning from heaven.\nWe shall have to meet these same false doctrines again. There\nwill be those who will claim to have visions. When God gives you\nclear evidence that the vision is from Him, you may accept it, but\ndo not accept it on any other evidence; for people are going to be\nled more and more astray in foreign countries and in America. The\nLord wants His people to act like men and women of sense.\nIn the future, deception of every kind is to arise, and we want\nsolid ground for our feet. We want solid pillars for the building. Not\none pin is to be removed from that which the Lord has established....\nWhere shall we find safety unless it be in the truths that the Lord has\nbeen giving for the last fifty years?\u2014The Review and Herald, May\n25, 1905.\nAs the Serpent Beguiled Eve\u2014False theories, repeated again\nand again, appear as falsely inviting today as did the fruit of the\nforbidden tree in the Garden of Eden. The fruit was very beautiful,\nand apparently desirable for food. Through false doctrines many\nsouls have already been destroyed.\u2014Manuscript 37, 1906.\nDiseased With Fanaticism and Extremism \u2014As the natural\neyesight of persons becomes so impaired as to be almost useless,\nso in the case of religious fanaticism and extremists, the eye of the\nsoul through which good and evil may be discerned, becomes so [611]\nperverted that nothing is distinguished clearly. A healthful discern-\nment is ruined, so the spirit of truth and righteousness cannot be\ndistinguished from the spirit of error and fanaticism.\nThere is a disease of the spiritual faculties when a man or woman\nfancies that he sees things which do not exist. He is intoxicated with\n553\n554 Evangelism\nan illusion as verily as the liquor drinker becomes intoxicated by\nusing strong drink. There is an inspiration, but not of God. The\nmental faculties are perverted. Let every soul make God his trust and\nobtain an experience that is wholesome and healthy.\u2014Manuscript\n41, 1900.\nIn the Fire or in the Water \u2014There is a class of people who\nare always ready to go off on some tangent, who want to catch up\nsomething strange and wonderful and new; but God desires us all to\nmove calmly, considerately, choosing our words in harmony with\nthe solid truth for this time. The truth should be presented to the\nmind as free as possible from that which is emotional, while still\nbearing the intensity and solemnity befitting its character. We must\nguard against encouraging extremists, those who would be either in\nthe fire or in the water.\nI beseech you to weed out of your teachings every extravagant\nexpression, everything that unbalanced minds and those who are\ninexperienced will catch up and which will lead them to make wild,\nimmature movements. It is necessary for you to cultivate caution\nin every statement, lest you start some on a wrong track, and make\nconfusion that will require much sorrowful labor to set in order,\nthus diverting the strength of the laborers into lines which God\ndoes not design shall be entered. One manifestation of fanaticism\namong us will close many doors against the soundest principles of[612]\ntruth.\u2014Manuscript 82, 1894.\nSacred Truth Dishonored by Excitement \u2014We need to be\nthoughtful and still, and to contemplate the truths of revelation.\nExcitement is not favorable to growth in grace, to true purity and\nsanctification of the Spirit.\nGod wants us to deal with sacred truth. This alone will convince\nthe gainsayer. Calm, sensible labor must be put forth....\nGod calls upon His people to walk with sobriety and holy consis-\ntency. They should be very careful not to misrepresent and dishonor\nthe holy doctrines of truth by strange performances, by confusion\nand tumult. By this unbelievers are led to think that Seventh-day\nAdventists are a set of fanatics. Thus prejudice is created that pre-\nvents souls from receiving the message for this time. When believers\nspeak the truth as it is in Jesus, they reveal a holy, sensible calm, not\na storm of confusion.\u2014Manuscript 76a, 1901.\nFanaticism and Extremism 555\nFalse Teachers Misplace Prophecy\u2014In our day as in Christ\u2019s\nday, there may be a misreading and misinterpreting of the Scriptures.\nIf the Jews had studied the Scriptures with earnest, prayerful hearts,\ntheir searching would have been rewarded with a true knowledge\nof the time, and not only the time, but also the manner of Christ\u2019s\nappearing. They would not have ascribed the glorious second ap-\npearing of Christ to His first advent. They had the testimony of\nDaniel; they had the testimony of Isaiah and the other prophets; they\nhad the teachings of Moses; and here was Christ in their very midst,\nand still they were searching the Scriptures for evidence in regard\nto His coming. And they were doing unto Christ the very things\nthat had been prophesied they would do. They were so blinded they [613]\nknew not what they were doing.\nAnd many are doing the same thing today, in 1897, because they\nhave not had experience in the testing messages comprehended in\nthe first, second, and third angel\u2019s messages. There are those who\nare searching the Scriptures for proof that these messages are still\nin the future. They gather together the truthfulness of the messages,\nbut they fail to give them their proper place in prophetic history.\nTherefore such are in danger of misleading the people in regard to\nlocating the messages. They do not see and understand the time\nof the end, or when to locate the messages. The day of God is\ncoming with stealthy tread, but the supposed wise and great men\nare prating about \u201chigher education.\u201d They know not the signs of\nChrist\u2019s coming, or of the end of the world.\u2014Manuscript 136, 1897.\nMisrepresentations of the Godhead\nLet People Know Our Position\u2014Our policy is, Do not make\nprominent the objectionable features of our faith, which strike most\ndecidedly against the practices and customs of the people, until the\nLord shall give the people a fair chance to know that we are believers\nin Christ, that we do believe in the divinity of Christ, and in His\npre-existence.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 253\n(1895).\nWe Shall Have to Meet Erroneous Teaching \u2014Again and\nagain we shall be called to meet the influence of men who are study-\ning sciences of satanic origin, through which Satan is working to\nmake a nonentity of God and of Christ. The Father and the Son each\nhave a personality. Christ declared, \u201cI and My Father are one.\u201d Yet it[614]\nwas the Son of God who came to the world in human form. Laying\naside His royal robe and kingly crown, He clothed His divinity with\nhumanity, that humanity through His infinite sacrifice might become\npartakers of the divine nature, and escape the corruption that is in\nthe world through lust.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:68 (1909).\nPositive Truth Versus Spiritualistic Representations\u2014I am\ninstructed to say, The sentiments of those who are searching for\nadvanced scientific ideas are not to be trusted. Such representations\nas the following are made: \u201cThe Father is as the light invisible: the\nSon is as the light embodied; the Spirit is the light shed abroad.\u201d\n\u201cThe Father is like the dew, invisible vapor; the Son is like the dew\ngathered in beauteous form; the Spirit is like the dew fallen to the\nseat of life.\u201d Another representation: \u201cThe Father is like the invisible\nvapor; the Son is like the leaden cloud; the Spirit is rain fallen and\nworking in refreshing power.\u201d\nAll these spiritualistic representations are simply nothingness.\nThey are imperfect, untrue. They weaken and diminish the Majesty\nwhich no earthly likeness can be compared to. God cannot be com-\npared with the things His hands have made. These are mere earthly\nthings, suffering under the curse of God because of the sins of man.\n556\nMisrepresentations of the Godhead 557\nThe Father cannot be described by the things of earth. The Father\nis all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and is invisible to mortal\nsight.\nThe Son is all the fullness of the Godhead manifested. The\nWord of God declares Him to be \u201cthe express image of His person.\u201d\n\u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that\nwhosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting [615]\nlife.\u201d Here is shown the personality of the Father.\nThe Comforter that Christ promised to send after He ascended\nto heaven, is the Spirit in all the fullness of the Godhead, making\nmanifest the power of divine grace to all who receive and believe\nin Christ as a personal Saviour. There are three living persons of\nthe heavenly trio; in the name of these three great powers\u2014the\nFather, the Son, and the Holy Spirit\u2014those who receive Christ by\nliving faith are baptized, and these powers will co-operate with the\nobedient subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life in\nChrist.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 7, pp. 62, 63. (1905).\nThe Pre-existent, Self-existent Son of God\u2014Christ is the pre-\nexistent, self-existent Son of God.... In speaking of his pre-existence,\nChrist carries the mind back through dateless ages. He assures us\nthat there never was a time when He was not in close fellowship with\nthe eternal God. He to whose voice the Jews were then listening\nhad been with God as one brought up with Him.\u2014The Signs of the\nTimes, August 29, 1900.\nHe was equal with God, infinite and omnipotent.... He is the\neternal, self-existent Son.\u2014Manuscript 101, 1897.\nFrom Everlasting\u2014While God\u2019s Word speaks of the humanity\nof Christ when upon this earth, it also speaks decidedly regarding\nHis pre-existence. The Word existed as a divine being, even as the\neternal Son of God, in union and oneness with His Father. From\neverlasting He was the Mediator of the covenant, the one in whom\nall nations of the earth, both Jews and Gentiles, if they accepted\nHim, were to be blessed. \u201cThe Word was with God, and the Word\nwas God.\u201d Before men or angels were created, the Word was with\nGod, and was God.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 5, 1906. [616]\nChrist shows them that, although they might reckon His life to\nbe less than fifty years, yet His divine life could not be reckoned by\n558 Evangelism\nhuman computation. The existence of Christ before His incarnation\nis not measured by figures.\u2014The Signs of the Times, May 3, 1899.\nLife, Original, Unborrowed, Underived \u2014Jesus declared, \u201cI\nam the resurrection, and the life.\u201d In Christ is life, original, unbor-\nrowed, underived. \u201cHe that hath the Son hath life.\u201d The divinity\nof Christ is the believer\u2019s assurance of eternal life.\u2014The Desire of\nAges, 530 (1898).\nWith the Father at Sinai\u2014When they [Israel] came to Sinai,\nHe took occasion to refresh their minds in regard to His requirements.\nChrist and the Father, standing side by side upon the mount, with\nsolemn majesty proclaimed the Ten Commandments.\u2014Historical\nSketches, p. 231. (1866).\nThe Eternal Dignitaries of the Trinity\u2014The eternal heavenly\ndignitaries\u2014God, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit\u2014arming them\n[the disciples] with more than mortal energy, ... would advance with\nthem to the work and convince the world of sin.\u2014Manuscript 130,\n1901.\nPersonality of the Holy Spirit \u2014We need to realize that the\nHoly Spirit, who is as much a person as God is a person, is walking\nthrough these grounds.\u2014Manuscript 66, 1899 (From a talk to the\nstudents at the Avondale School.).\nThe Holy Spirit is a person, for He beareth witness with our\nspirits that we are the children of God. When this witness is borne,\nit carries with it its own evidence. At such times we believe and are\nsure that we are the children of God....\nThe Holy Spirit has a personality, else He could not bear witness[617]\nto our spirits and with our spirits that we are the children of God. He\nmust also be a divine person, else He could not search out the secrets\nwhich lie hidden in the mind of God. \u201cFor what man knoweth the\nthings of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the\nthings of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.\u201d\u2014Manuscript\n20, 1906.\nThe Power of God in the Third Person \u2014The prince of the\npower of evil can only be held in check by the power of God in the\nthird person of the Godhead, the Holy Spirit.\u2014Special Testimonies,\nSeries A, No. 10, p. 37.

(1905).\nSecret Societies\nThe Perils of the Secret Societies\u2014The Lord\u2019s injunction, \u201cBe\nye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers,\u201d refers not only\nto the marriage of Christians with the ungodly, but to all alliances in\nwhich the parties are brought into intimate association, and in which\nthere is need of harmony in spirit and action....\nThe Lord declares through the prophet Isaiah: \u201cAssociate your-\nselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give\near, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken\nin pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. Take\ncounsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it[618]\nshall not stand: for God is with us. For the Lord spake thus to me\nwith a strong hand, and instructed me that I should not walk in the\nway of this people, saying, Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them\nto whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their\nfear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and let Him\nbe your fear, and let Him be your dread.\u201d Isaiah 8:9-13.\nThere are those who question whether it is right for Christians\nto belong to the Free Masons and other secret societies. Let all\nsuch consider the scriptures just quoted. If we are Christians at all,\nwe must be Christians everywhere, and must consider and heed the\ncounsel given to make us Christians according to the standard of\nGod\u2019s Word....\nWhen we accepted Christ as our Redeemer, we accepted the\ncondition of becoming laborers together with God. We made a\ncovenant with Him to be wholly for the Lord; as faithful stewards of\nthe grace of Christ, to labor for the upbuilding of His kingdom in the\nworld. Every follower of Christ stands pledged to dedicate all his\npowers, of mind and soul and body, to Him who has paid the ransom\nmoney for our souls. We engaged to be soldiers, to enter into active\nservice, to endure trials, shame, reproach, to fight the fight of faith,\nfollowing the Captain of our salvation.\n560\nSecret Societies 561\nIn your connection with worldly societies, are you keeping your\ncovenant with God? Do these associations tend to direct your own\nmind or that of others to God, or are they diverting the interest and\nattention from Him? Do they strengthen your connection with the\ndivine agencies, or turn your mind to the human in place of the\ndivine?\nAre you serving, honoring, and magnifying God, or are you [619]\ndishonoring Him and sinning against Him? Are you gathering with\nChrist or scattering abroad? All the thought and plan and earnest\ninterest devoted to these organizations, has been purchased by the\nprecious blood of Christ; but are you doing service for Him when\nuniting yourselves with atheists and infidels, men who profane the\nname of God, tipplers, drunkards, tobacco devotees?\nWhile there may be in these societies much that appears to be\ngood, there is, mingled with this, very much that makes the good of\nno effect, and renders these associations detrimental to the interests\nof the soul....\nI ask you who take pleasure in these associations, who love the\ngathering for indulgence in wit and merriment and feasting, Do you\ntake Jesus with you? Are you seeking to save the souls of your\ncompanions? Is that the object of your association with them? Do\nthey see and feel that there is in you a living embodiment of the Spirit\nof Christ? Is it manifest that you are a witness for Christ, that you\nbelong to a peculiar people, zealous of good works? Is it manifest\nthat your life is governed by the divine precepts, \u201cThou shalt love\nthe Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with\nall thy mind,\u201d and, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\u201d?....\nThose who cannot discern between him that serveth God and\nhim that serveth Him not, may be charmed with these societies that\nhave no connection with God, but no earnest Christian can prosper\nin such an atmosphere. The vital air of heaven is not there. His soul\nis barren, and he feels as destitute of the refreshing of the Holy Spirit\nas were the hills of Gilboa of dew and rain.\nAt times the follower of Christ may by circumstances be com- [620]\npelled to witness scenes of unholy pleasure, but it is with a sorrowful\nheart. The language is not the language of Canaan, and the child\nof God will never choose such associations. When he is necessar-\nily brought into society that he does not choose, let him lean upon\n562 Evangelism\nGod, and the Lord will preserve him. But he is not to sacrifice his\nprinciples in any cases, whatever the temptation.\nChrist will never lead His followers to take upon themselves\nvows that will unite them with men who have no connection with\nGod, who are not under the controlling influence of His Holy Spirit.\nThe only correct standard of character is the holy law of God, and it\nis impossible for those who make that law the rule of life to unite in\nconfidence and cordial brotherhood with those who turn the truth of\nGod into a lie, and regard the authority of God as a thing of nought.\nBetween the worldly man and the one who is faithfully serving\nGod, there is a great gulf fixed. Upon the most momentous sub-\njects,\u2014God and truth and eternity,\u2014their thoughts and sympathies\nand feelings are not in harmony. One class is ripening as wheat for\nthe garner of God, the other as tares for the fires of destruction. How\ncan there be unity of purpose or action between them? \u201cKnow ye\nnot that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever\ntherefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\u201d \u201cNo\nman can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love\nother; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye\ncannot serve God and mammon.\u201d\u2014Should Christians Be Members\nof Secret Societies? pp. 3-10. (1892).\nClear-cut Separation\u2014In the evening I met Brother _____ and\ntold him I had something for him from the Lord. He said, \u201cWhy not\nlet me have it now?\u201d I was quite weak, but he lived in _____, ten[621]\nmiles from the school building which was to be my home. So I arose\nand read to him fifty pages of letter pages, in reference to the office,\nand also particular ones working in the office. [Reference is made\nto a communication from which the preceding article is drawn.]\nI spoke ... plainly and in clear lines in reference to his past work\nand what a loss it had been to the office. His connection with Free\nMasonry had absorbed his time and blunted his spiritual perception.\nHis mind, his thoughts, had been upon this body, this association;\nand there were infidels, winebibbers, and every class. And he was\nbound up with these secret organizations. There was only one thing\nhe could do\u2014sever his connection with them and be wholly on the\nLord\u2019s side; for he could not possibly serve God and mammon.\nHe said, \u201cI receive the testimony; I shall heed its instruction.\u201d\u2014\nManuscript 17, 1892.\nSecret Societies 563\nBrother _____ was in a perilous condition, like a man about to\nlose his balance and fall over a precipice. I knew what nice work\nit is to deal with human minds, and I was thankful when the time\ncame when it was safe for me to present to him his danger. The\nLord of heaven would have us fear to judge one another; as finite,\nerring beings we should be suspicious of ourselves, we should fear\nlest we offend God in bruising the souls of His children. They are\nthe purchase of the Son of God, bought by His own precious blood,\nand are not to be accused or oppressed by word or act, for the Lord\nwill stand in their defense.\nWednesday I was drawn out to speak of the principles upon\nwhich we should deal with minds and direct them in the right way.\nMany in the world have their affections on things that may be good\nin themselves, but their minds are satisfied with these things, and do [622]\nnot seek the greater and higher good that Christ desires to give them.\nNow we must not rudely seek to deprive them of what they hold dear.\nReveal to them the beauty and preciousness of truth. Lead them\nto behold Christ and His loveliness, then they will turn aside from\neverything that will draw their affections away from Him.\u2014Letter\n23a, 1893.\nA Message of Commendation\u2014I am very thankful to our gra-\ncious heavenly Father that He has given you strength through His\nimparted grace to cut yourself loose from the Free Mason lodge and\nall that relates to the society. It was not safe for you to have any\npart with this secret order. Those who stand under the blood-stained\nbanner of Prince Immanuel cannot be united with the Free Masons\nor with any secret organization. The seal of the living God will not\nbe placed upon anyone who maintains such a connection after the\nlight of truth has shone upon his pathway. Christ is not divided, and\nChristians cannot serve God and mammon. The Lord says, \u201cCome\nout from among them, and be ye separate, ... and touch not the\nunclean thing; and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto\nyou, and ye shall be My sons and My daughters, saith the Lord\nAlmighty.\u201d\u2014Letter 21, 1893.\nDeceptions Through Secret Societies\u2014The world is a theater;\nthe actors, its inhabitants, are preparing to act their part in the last\ngreat drama. With the great masses of mankind, there is no unity,\nexcept as men confederate to accomplish their selfish purposes. God\n564 Evangelism\nis looking on. His purposes in regard to His rebellious subjects will\nbe fulfilled. The world has not been given into the hands of men,\nthough God is permitting the elements of confusion and disorder to\nbear sway for a season. A power from beneath is working to bring[623]\nabout the last great scenes in the drama,\u2014Satan coming as Christ,\nand working with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in those\nwho are binding themselves together in secret societies. Those who\nare yielding to the passion for confederation are working out the\nplans of the enemy. The cause will be followed by the effect.\nTransgression has almost reached its limit. Confusion fills the\nworld, and a great terror is soon to come upon human beings. The\nend is very near. We who know the truth should be preparing for\nwhat is soon to break upon the world as an overwhelming surprise.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 8:27-28 (1904).\nCombating Erroneous Teaching\nMeet Sophistries With Truth\u2014I am instructed to say to you\nthat it is not best to dwell upon the spiritualistic sentiments, the\nstrange, misleading theories, which have for years been coming in\namong us.\nIt is not best to preach on the subject of Pantheism or to read\nquotations from authors who write on this subject, and the specious,\ndeceptive errors that lead to it. The statements made in Testimonies,\nvolume 8, are sufficient to warn our people to avoid these errors.\nThese statements will do more to enlighten minds than all the ex-\nplanations or theories that our ministers and teachers may put forth\nconcerning these matters.\nIf you try to handle these subjects, you will be led to repeat the\nsophistries of Satan, and thus you will help Satan to present his\nfalse theories to the people. Resolve never, never to repeat error,\nbut always to teach the truth. Fill hearts and minds with the solemn,\nsacred truth for this time.\nDwell on present truth, on Christ\u2019s second coming. The Lord is [624]\ncoming very soon. We have only a little while in which to present\nthe truth for this time\u2014the truth that is to convert souls. This truth\nis to be presented in the utmost simplicity, even as Christ presented\nit, so that the people can understand what is truth. Truth will dispel\nthe clouds of error.\nGive the people present truth. Talk the truth. Fill their minds\nwith truth. Build up the strongholds of truth. And do not bring\nSatan\u2019s theories to minds that should not hear in regard to them.\nWhat the people need is not a representation of the seductive arts of\nSatan, but a presentation of the truth as it is in Jesus. Remember that\nthe devil can be served by a repetition of his lies. The less we handle\nthese objectionable subjects, the purer, cleaner, and less tainted will\nbe our minds and our principles....\nAnd I have been shown that we are not to enter into controversy\nover these spiritualistic theories, because such controversy will only\n565\n566 Evangelism\nconfuse minds. These things are not to be brought into our meetings.\nWe are not to labor to refute them. If our ministers and teachers\ngive themselves to the study of these erroneous theories, some will\ndepart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines\nof devils. It is not the work of the gospel minister to voice Satan\u2019s\ntheories....\nHold up the truth; magnify the truth; say, \u201cIt is written.\u201d\u2014Letter\n175, 1904.\nFalsehoods Must Be Skillfully Unmasked\u2014The apostle Paul\nwarns us that \u201csome shall depart from the faith, giving heed to\nseducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.\u201d This is what we may\nexpect. Our greatest trials will come because of that class who have\nonce advocated the truth, but who turn from it to the world, and[625]\ntrample it under their feet in hate and derision.\nGod has a work for His faithful servants to do. The attacks\nof the enemy must be met with the truth of His Word. Falsehood\nmust be unmasked, its true character must be revealed, and the light\nof the law of Jehovah must shine forth into the moral darkness of\nthe world. We are to present the claims of His Word. We shall\nnot be held guiltless if we neglect this solemn duty. But while we\nstand in defense of the truth, let us not stand in defense of self,\nand make a great ado because we are called to bear reproach and\nmisrepresentation. Let us not pity ourselves, but be very jealous for\nthe law of the Most High.\nSays the apostle, \u201cThe time will come when they will not endure\nsound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves\nteachers, having itching ears: and they shall turn away their ears\nfrom the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.\u201d On every side we\nsee men easily led captive by the delusive imaginations of those who\nmake void the Word of God; but when the truth is brought before\nthem, they are filled with impatience and anger. But the exhortation\nof the apostle to the servant of God is, \u201cWatch thou in all things,\nendure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of\nthy ministry.\u201d...\nWe must cherish carefully the words of our God lest we be\ncontaminated by the deceptive workings of those who have left\nthe faith. We are to resist their spirit and influence with the same\nweapon our Master used when assailed by the prince of darkness\u2014\nCombating Erroneous Teaching 567\n\u201cIt is written.\u201d We should learn to use the Word of God skillfully.\nThe exhortation is, \u201cStudy to show thyself approved unto God, a\nworkman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word [626]\nof truth.\u201d There must be diligent work and earnest prayer and faith to\nmeet the winding error of false teachers and seducers; for \u201cin the last\ndays perilous times shall come.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, January\n10, 1888.\nThe Sincere Rescued From Deceptions\u2014The means by which\nwe can overcome the wicked one is that by which Christ overcame\u2014\nthe power of the Word. God does not control our minds without our\nconsent; but if we desire to know and to do His will, His promises\nare ours: \u201cYe shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\u201d\n\u201cIf any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching.\u201d\nThrough faith in these promises, every man may be delivered from\nthe snares of error and the control of sin.\nEvery man is free to choose what power he will have to rule over\nhim. None have fallen so low, none are so vile, but that they can find\ndeliverance in Christ. The demoniac, in place of prayer, could utter\nonly the words of Satan; yet the heart\u2019s unspoken appeal was heard.\nNo cry from a soul in need, though it fail of utterance in words, will\nbe unheeded. Those who will consent to enter into covenant relation\nwith the God of heaven are not left to the power of Satan or to the\ninfirmity of their own nature. They are invited by the Saviour, \u201cLet\nhim take hold of My strength, that he may make peace with Me; and\nhe shall make peace with Me.\u201d The spirits of darkness will battle for\nthe soul once under their dominion, but angels of God will contend\nfor that soul with prevailing power.\u2014The Desire of Ages, 258, 259\n(1898).\nTo Curious Admit We Do Not Know\u2014Letters have come to\nus in regard to matters upon which God has given us no light, and\nwe are pleased to say to these inquirers, We do not know . The\ngreat anxiety in every mind should be to know God and do His [627]\nrequirements. Blessed are they that hear the Word of God and keep\nit....\nThose who are so curious to find out things that have not been\nmade known in the Scriptures are generally surface students in\nregard to those things which have a bearing on the daily life and\npractice.... We are to reveal to the world that which God has seen\n568 Evangelism\nnecessary to reveal to us. We are not doing the will of our heavenly\nFather when we speculate upon things which He has seen fit to\nwithhold from us. It is the privilege of everyone to reveal to others\nthat he appreciates the worth of divine truths, that he appreciates\nthe treasures of eternal life, by making every sacrifice to obtain the\nreward.\u2014Manuscript 104, 1898.\nSection 19\u2014The Worker and His [628]\nQualifications\nThe Spirit of the Ministry\nTravail for Souls\u2014As the shepherd is to go after the lost sheep,\nhe is not to have merely a casual interest, but an earnest travail\nfor souls. This calls for most earnest heart searching, most earnest\nprayerful seeking for God, in order that we may know Him and the\npower of His grace, \u201cthat in the ages to come He might show the\nexceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us through\nChrist Jesus.\u201d\u2014Letter 8, 1895.\nCompassion for the Unsaved\u2014But how few of us regard the\nsalvation of sinners in the light in which it is viewed by the heavenly\nuniverse,\u2014as a plan devised from eternity in the mind of God! How\nfew of us are heart to heart with the Redeemer in this solemn, closing\nwork! There is scarcely a tithe of the compassion that there should\nbe for souls unsaved. There are so many to be warned, and yet\nhow few sympathize with God sufficiently to be anything or nothing\nif only they can see souls won to Christ!\u2014Gospel Workers, 116\n(1915).\nConsecration, Love, and Self-Sacrifice\u2014The worker for God\nshould put forth the highest mental and moral energies with which\nnature, cultivation, and the grace of God have endowed him; but\nhis success will be proportionate to the degree of consecration and\nself-sacrifice in which his work is done, rather than to either natural[629]\nor acquired endowments.... Divine grace is the great element of\nsaving power; without it all human effort is unavailing.\u2014Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Students, 537, 538 (1913).\nLove and Compassion\u2014The Lord wants men to forget them-\nselves in the effort to save souls. Our life is worse than a failure if we\ngo through life without leaving waymarks of love and compassion.\nGod will not work with a harsh, stubborn, loveless man. Such a man\nspoils the pattern that Christ desires His workers to reveal to the\nworld. God\u2019s workers, in whatever line of service they are engaged,\nare to bring into their efforts the goodness and benevolence and love\nof Christ.\n570\nSpirit of the Ministry 571\nGod calls for light bearers who will fill the world with the light\nand peace and joy that come from Christ. God will use humble\nmen, men who will cherish a sense of their weakness, who will not\nthink that the work of God depends on them. Such men will remem-\nber what the service of God demands from them\u2014the propriety of\nspeech and action that God calls for. They will reveal that Christ\ndwells in the heart, imparting purity to the whole being.\u2014Letter\n197, 1902.\nThe Simplicity of Children\u2014Let us work with all our capabil-\nities, seeking to make the truth for this time plain to those who do\nnot understand it. The blessing of the Lord will rest upon every soul\nwho will take hold of His work intelligently....\nLet us cultivate the simplicity of little children. The precious\nBible, the Book of God, is our instructor. To all who will walk\nhumbly with God He will give His Holy Spirit and will minister to\nthem through the agency of holy angels to make right impressions\nupon human minds.\u2014Manuscript 77, 1909.\nWithout Praise\u2014We must do our work purely and faithfully [630]\neven though there is no one in the world to say, \u201cIt is well done.\u201d Our\nlives must be just what God designs they shall be\u2014faithful in good\nwords, in kind and thoughtful deeds, in the expression of meekness,\npurity, and love. Thus we represent Christ to the world....\nThe toilworn men, who are now first and foremost in the great\nwork of saving souls, are the ones whom God will honor.\u2014Letter\n120, 1898.\nDanger of Flattery\u2014Keep the eye fixed on Christ. Do not fix\nyour attention on some favorite minister, copying his example and\nimitating his gestures; in short, becoming his shadow. Let no man\nput his mold upon you....\nPraise no man; flatter no man; and permit no man to praise or\nflatter you. Satan will do enough of this work. Lose sight of the\ninstrument, and think of Jesus. Praise the Lord. Give glory to God.\nMake melody to God in your hearts. Talk of the truth. Talk of the\nChristian\u2019s hope, the Christian\u2019s heaven.\u2014Manuscript 8a, 1888.\nFeelings Not Easily Wounded\u2014We should not allow our feel-\nings to be easily wounded. We are to live not to guard our feelings\nor our reputation, but to save souls. As we become interested in\nthe salvation of souls, we cease to mind the little differences that\n572 Evangelism\nso often arise in our association with one another. Whatever others\nmay think of us, it need not disturb our oneness with Christ, the\nfellowship of the Spirit.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 485 (1905).\nCheerful and Joyful Spirit \u2014When we have an assurance,\nwhich is bright and clear, of our own salvation, we shall exhibit\ncheerfulness and joyfulness, which becomes every follower of Jesus[631]\nChrist. The softening, subduing influence of the love of God brought\ninto practical lives will make impressions upon minds that will be a\nsavor of life unto life. But a harsh denunciatory spirit, if manifested,\nwill turn many souls away from the truth into the ranks of the enemy.\nSolemn thought! To deal patiently with the tempted requires us to\nbattle with self.\u2014Letter 1a, 1894.\nMeek and Lowly in Heart \u2014The value of our work does not\nconsist in making a loud noise in the world, in being zealous, eager,\nand active in our own strength. The value of our work is in proportion\nto the impartation of the Holy Spirit. The value of our work comes\nthrough trust in God, which brings holier qualities of mind, so that\nin patience we may possess our souls. We should continually pray\nto God to increase our strength, to make us strong in His strength, to\nkindle in our hearts the flame of divine love. The cause of God is best\nadvanced by those who are meek and lowly in heart.\u2014Manuscript\n38, 1895.\nGod\u2019s Work, Not Ours\u2014Now, here is the very thing that we\nwant to understand, that it is not our work but God\u2019s work, and we\nare only instruments in His hands to accomplish it. We want to seek\nthe Lord with all our hearts, and the Lord will work for us.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, May 10, 1887.\nSacrifice at Every Step\u2014We are nearing the end of this earth\u2019s\nhistory, and the different departments of God\u2019s work are to be carried\nforward with much more self-sacrifice than has yet been practiced.\nThe work for these last days is a missionary work. Present truth,\nfrom the first to the last letter of its alphabet, means missionary effort.\nThe work to be done calls for sacrifice at every step of advance. The\nworkers are to come forth from trial, purified and refined, as gold[632]\ntried in the fire.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 18, 1902.\nTeaching and Living the Doctrines\u2014God\u2019s servants are to use\nthe greatest care in regard to the doctrines they teach, the example\nthey set, and the influence they exert on those associated with them.\nSpirit of the Ministry 573\nThe great apostle appeals to the church and to God to witness to the\ntruth and the sincerity of his profession. \u201cYe are witnesses, and God\nalso,\u201d he says, \u201chow holily and justly and unblamably we behaved\nourselves among you.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, December 11,\n1900.\nAvoid Business Entanglements \u2014We are to be workers to-\ngether with Him. Those who are in His service need to separate from\nall business entanglements that would tarnish their Christlikeness\nof character. The fishermen that the Saviour called, straightway left\ntheir nets. Those who give themselves to the work of the ministry\nmust not entangle themselves in business lines that will bring a\ncoarseness into their lives and will be a detriment to their spiritual\nadvancement in the work of the Lord has given them to do.\u2014Letter\n53, 1905.\nInsincerity Is Fatal\u2014There must be no duplicity, no crooked-\nness, in the life of the worker. While error even when held in sin-\ncerity, is dangerous to anyone, insincerity in the truth is fatal.\u2014The\nMedical Missionary, January, 1891.\nHarsh Spirit Denies Christ \u2014Men may speak fluently upon\ndoctrines, and may express strong faith in theories, but do they pos-\nsess Christianlike meekness and love? If they reveal a harsh, critical\nspirit, they are denying Christ. If they are not kind, tenderhearted,\nlong-suffering, they are not like Jesus; they are deceiving their own\nsouls. A spirit contrary to the love, humility, meekness, and gentle-\nness of Christ, denies Him, whatever may be the profession.\u2014The [633]\nReview and Herald, February 9, 1892.\nTalk Faith and Encouragement \u2014Let us take heed to our\nwords. Let us talk faith, and we shall have faith. Never give place to\na thought of discouragement in the work of God. Never utter a word\nof doubt. It is as seed sown in the heart of both speaker and hearers,\nto produce a harvest of discouragement and unbelief.\u2014Letter 77,\n1895.\nCriticism of Fellow Workers Depresses\u2014It is our privilege to\nspeak words that will encourage our associates and fellow laborers;\nit is not our privilege to speak works that will depress. It is not wise\nfor us to compare ourselves with other workers, speaking of their\nfailings, and raising objections to their methods of labor. It would\nbe no surprise if those who are laboring under grave responsibil-\n574 Evangelism\nities, and who have many trials to meet, should sometimes make\nmistakes....\nLet us become familiar with the good that is being done by our\nbrethren, and talk of that.\u2014Letter 204, 1907.\nJealousy and Suspicion Produce Disunion\u2014There is nothing\nthat so much retards and cripples the work in its various branches\nas jealousy and suspicion and evil surmisings. These reveal that\ndisunion prevails among the workers for God. Selfishness is the root\nof all evil.\u2014Letter 113a, 1897.\nIrreparable Harm to Associate Workers \u2014Let no one be\nsharp and dictatorial in his dealings with God\u2019s workers. Let those\nwho are inclined to censure remember that they have made mistakes\nas grievous as those they condemn in others. Let them bow in con-\ntrition before God, asking His pardon for the sharp speeches they[634]\nhave made and the unguarded spirit they have revealed. Remember\nthat God hears every word you speak, and that as you judge, you\nwill be judged....\nShall we not remedy the difficulties that exist by striving to\nrestore the wounded, not by cutting off their limbs, leaving them\ncrippled for life, their usefulness impaired, when they might have\nbeen restored?\u2014Manuscript 143, 1902.\nCriticism of Others Weakens Own Work \u2014The plans and\nmethods of God\u2019s workers are to be thoroughly sifted from worldly\npolicy. Their work is to be carried forward with Christlike simplic-\nity. Remember that he who takes the position of a criticizer greatly\nweakens his own hands. God has not made it the duty of men or of\nwomen to find fault with their fellow workers.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 2, 1902.\nSatan\u2019s Special Temptation\u2014If men desire to place themselves\nwhere they can be used by God, they must not criticize others, to\nmake their defects apparent. This is Satan\u2019s special temptation,\nwhereby he strives to hinder the work.\u2014Manuscript 152, 1898.\nSelf-sufficiency Tears Down the Work \u2014We want men who\nwill strengthen and build up the work, not tear down and seek to\ndestroy that which others are trying to do. We need men and women\nwhom God can work, the fallow ground of whose heart has been\nbroken up.\nSpirit of the Ministry 575\nWe do not need workers who must be supported and carried by\nthose who have long been in the faith, who regard themselves as a\nperfect whole. To such we would say, \u201cStay where you are.\u201d We have\nhad enough to do with this class of workers. We want workers who\nare not steeped in selfishness, those who are not self-sufficient.\u2014\nManuscript 173, 1898.\nComplicating Advancement of the Message \u2014The attributes [635]\nof the enemy of God and man too often find expression in their spirit\nand attitude toward one another. They hurt one another, because they\nare not partakers of the divine nature; and thus they work against the\nperfection of their own character. They bring trouble to themselves,\nand make the work hard and toilsome, because they regard their\nspirit and defects of character as precious virtues, to be clung to and\nfostered....\nMen make the work of advancing the truth tenfold harder than\nit really is, by seeking to take God\u2019s work out of His hands into\ntheir own finite hands. They think they must be constantly inventing\nsomething to make men do things which they suppose these persons\nought to do. The time thus spent is all the while making the work\nmore complicated; for the great Chief Worker is left out of the\nquestion in the care of His own heritage. Men undertake the job of\ntinkering up the defective character of others, and only succeed in\nmaking the defects much worse. They would better leave God to do\nHis own work; for He does not regard them as capable of reshaping\ncharacter.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, February 25, 1895.\nHewn and Polished in Service \u2014Those who are defective in\ncharacter, in conduct, in habits and practices, are to take heed to\ncounsel and reproof. This world is God\u2019s workshop, and every stone\nthat can be used in the heavenly temple, must be hewed and polished,\nuntil it is a tried and precious stone, fitted for its place in the Lord\u2019s\nbuilding. But if we refuse to be trained and disciplined, we shall be\nas stones that will not be hewed and polished, and that are cast aside\nat last as useless.\u2014The Youth\u2019s Instructor, August 31, 1893.\nThe Graces of Culture and Kindness[636]\nOur Great Example \u2014Christ carried out in His life His own\ndivine teachings. His zeal never led Him to become passionate.\nHe manifested consistency without obstinacy, benevolence without\nweakness, tenderness and sympathy without sentimentalism. He\nwas highly social; yet He possessed a reserved dignity that did not\nencourage undue familiarity. His temperance never led to bigotry\nor austerity. He was not conformed to this world; yet He was not\nindifferent to the wants of the least among men. He was awake to\nthe needs of all.\u2014Manuscript 132, 1902.\nThe Perfect Pattern\u2014From earliest years to manhood, Christ\nlived a life that was a perfect pattern of humility and industry and\nobedience. He was always thoughtful and considerate of others,\nalways self-denying. He came bearing the signature of heaven, not\nto be ministered unto, but to minister....\nThe unselfish life of Christ is an example to all. His character\nis a pattern of the characters we may form if we follow on in His\nfootsteps.\u2014Manuscript 108, 1903.\nDignity, Courtesy, Refinement\u2014Be sure to maintain the dig-\nnity of the work by a well-ordered life and godly conversation. Never\nbe afraid of raising the standard too high. The families who engage\nin the missionary work should come close to hearts. The spirit of\nJesus should pervade the soul of the worker; it is the pleasant, sym-\npathetic words, the manifestation of disinterested love for their souls,\nthat will break down the barriers of pride and selfishness, and show\nto unbelievers that we have the love of Christ; and then the truth\nwill find its way to the heart. This is our work, and the fulfilling of\nGod\u2019s plan. All coarseness and roughness must be put away from[637]\nus. Courtesy, refinement, Christian politeness, must be cherished.\nGuard against being abrupt and blunt. Do not regard such peculiar-\nities as virtues; for God does not so regard them. Endeavor not to\noffend any unnecessarily.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 25,\n1890.\n576\nGraces of Culture and Kindness 577\nChrist Our Exemplar of Etiquette \u2014Real refinement of\nthought and manner is better learned in the school of the divine\nTeacher than by any observance of set rules. His love pervading the\nheart gives to the character those refining touches that fashion it in\nthe semblance of His own. This education imparts a heaven-born\ndignity and sense of propriety. It gives a sweetness of disposition and\na gentleness of manner that can never be equaled by the superficial\npolish of fashionable society.\u2014Education, 241 (1903).\nTrue Etiquette\u2014Broad Sympathy and Kindness \u2014Many\nwho lay great stress upon etiquette show little respect for anything,\nhowever excellent, that fails of meeting their artificial standard. This\nis false education. It fosters critical pride and narrow exclusiveness.\nThe essence of true politeness is consideration for others. The\nessential, enduring education is that which broadens the sympathies\nand encourages universal kindness.\u2014Education, 241 (1903).\nTenderness and Kindness \u2014You both need a gentler touch.\nYour words are to soothe, not to harass. Let your hearts be filled with\nlove for souls. With a deep, tender interest, work for those around\nyou. If you see one making a mistake, go to him in the way Christ\nhas pointed out in His Word, and see if you cannot talk the matter\nover with Christlike tenderness. Pray with him, and believe that the\nSaviour will show you the way out of the difficulty.\nMinisters need much of the grace of God in order to do their [638]\nwork acceptably. When a minister finds the members of a church\narrayed against one another, let him call a halt, and endeavor to\nbring about a harmonious understanding. Let him never give sharp,\ndictatorial advice or orders. This is not necessary. It is labor worse\nthan wasted....\nThe Lord calls upon you to exert an uplifting influence. Receive\ninto the heart the truths of God\u2019s Word. Only thus can you have the\nmind of God. Place yourselves under the molding influence of the\nHoly Spirit. Then you will have much greater power for good....\nWherever the love of Jesus reigns, there is peace and rest. Where\nthis love is cherished, it is as a refreshing stream in a desert, trans-\nforming barrenness into fertility.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1902.\nTact and Good Judgment Melt Hearts\u2014Tact and good judg-\nment increase the usefulness of the laborer a hundredfold. If he will\nspeak the right words at the right time, and show the right spirit, this\n578 Evangelism\nwill exert a melting power on the heart of the one he is trying to help.\nGospel Workers, 119 (1915).\nKindness to Those Who Differ in Doctrine\u2014Those who differ\nwith us in faith and doctrine should be treated kindly. They are the\nproperty of Christ, and we must meet them in the great day of final\naccount. We shall have to face one another in the judgment, and\nbehold the record of our thoughts, words, and deeds, not as we have\nviewed them, but as they were in truth. God has enjoined upon us\nthe duty of loving one another as Christ has loved us.\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, December 9, 1897.\nWithout Personal Feeling and Selfishness \u2014Men must labor\naccording to His [God\u2019s] rules and arrangement if they would meet[639]\nwith success. God will accept only those efforts that are made will-\ningly and with humble hearts, without the trait of personal feelings\nor selfishness.\u2014Letter 66, 1887.\nPut On Gospel Shoes \u2014My brother, I have an intense desire\nthat you shall be a man after God\u2019s heart. You must make a change in\nyour life. You have most precious truth to present, but you must put\non the gospel shoes\u2014your feet must be \u201cshod with the preparation\nof the gospel of peace.\u201d Your manner of addressing people is not\nalways pleasing to God. You need to feel His converting power upon\nyour soul every day. You are full of physical strength and energy,\nand you need much of the grace of Christ, that it may be said of you\nas it was of Him, \u201cThy gentleness hath made me great.\u201d When the\nHoly Spirit takes possession of your mind and controls your strong\nfeelings, you will be more Christlike.\u2014Letter 164, 1902.\nSacredness of God\u2019s Work \u2014To handle sacred things as we\nwould common matters is an offense to God; for that which God has\nset apart to do His service in giving light to this world is holy. Those\nwho have any connection with the work of God are not to walk in\nthe vanity of their own wisdom, but in the wisdom of God, or they\nwill be in danger of placing sacred and common things on the same\nlevel, and thus separate themselves from God.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, September 8, 1896.\nSense of Sacred Responsibility \u2014Young men are arising to\nengage in the work of God, some of whom have scarcely any sense of\nthe sacredness and responsibility of the work.... They talk nonsense,\nand sport with young girls, while almost daily listening to the most\nGraces of Culture and Kindness 579\nsolemn, soul-stirring truths.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:473\n(1875).\nNot Actors, but Teachers of the Word\u2014I see that great refor- [640]\nmation must take place in the ministry before it shall be what God\nwould have it. Ministers in the desk have no license to behave like\ntheatrical performers, assuming attitudes and expressions calculated\nfor effect. They do not occupy the sacred desk as actors, but as\nteachers of solemn truths. There are also fanatical ministers, who,\nin attempting to preach Christ, storm, halloo, jump up and down,\nand pound the desk before them, as if this bodily exercise profited\nanything. Such antics lend no force to the truths uttered, but, on the\ncontrary, disgust men and women of calm judgment and elevated\nviews. It is the duty of men who give themselves to the ministry to\nleave all coarseness and boisterous conduct outside the desk at least.\nAwkward and uncouth gestures are not to be tolerated in the\ncommon walks of life; how much less, then, are they to be endured\nin the most sacred work of the gospel ministry. The minister should\ncultivate grace, courtesy, and refinement of manner. He should\ncarry himself with a quiet dignity becoming his elevated calling.\nSolemnity, a certain godly authority, mingled with meekness, should\ncharacterize the demeanor of him who is a teacher of God\u2019s truth.\nMinisters should not make a practice of relating anecdotes in the\ndesk; it detracts from the force and solemnity of the truth presented.\nThe relation of anecdotes or incidents which create a laugh or a\nlight thought in the minds of the hearers is severely censurable. The\ntruths should be clothed in chaste and dignified language; and the\nillustrations should be of a like character.\nWere the gospel ministry what it should and might be, the teach-\ners of Christ\u2019s truth would be working in harmony with the angels; [641]\nthey would be co-laborers with their great Teacher. There is too little\nprayer among the ministers of Christ, and too much self-exaltation.\nThere is too little weeping between the porch and the altar, and\ncrying, \u201cSpare Thy people, O Lord, and give not Thine heritage\nto reproach.\u201d There are too many long doctrinal sermons preached,\nwithout one spark of spiritual fervor and the love of God. There is\ntoo much gesticulation and relation of humorous anecdotes in the\npulpit, and too little said of the love and compassion of Jesus Christ.\n580 Evangelism\nIt is not enough to preach to men; we must pray with them and\nfor them; we must not hold ourselves coldly aloof from them, but\ncome in sympathy close to the souls we wish to save, visit and\nconverse with them. The minister who conducts the work outside\nthe pulpit in a proper manner will accomplish tenfold more than\nhe who confines his labor to the desk.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nAugust 8, 1878.\nAvoid Jesting and Joking\u2014This spirit of jesting and joking, of\nlightness and trifling, is a stumbling block to sinners and a worse\nstumbling block to those who give way to the inclination of the\nunsanctified heart. The fact that some have allowed this trait to\ndevelop and strengthen until jesting is as natural as their breath, does\nnot lessen its evil effects. When anyone can point to one trifling\nword spoken by our Lord, or to any lightness seen in His character,\nhe may feel that lightness and jesting are excusable in himself. This\nspirit is unchristian; for to be a Christian is to be Christlike. Jesus is\na perfect pattern, and we must imitate His example. A Christian is\nthe highest type of man, a representative of Christ.\nSome who are given to jesting, and to light and trifling remarks,\nmay appear in the sacred desk with becoming dignity. They may[642]\nbe able to pass at once to the contemplation of serious subjects,\nand present to their hearers the most important, testing truths ever\ncommitted to mortals; but perhaps their fellow laborers, whom they\nhave influenced, and who have joined with them in the careless jest,\ncannot change the current of their thoughts so readily. They feel\ncondemned, their minds are confused; and they are unfitted to enter\nupon the contemplation of heavenly themes, and preach Christ and\nHim crucified.\nThe disposition to say witty things that will create a laugh, when\nthe wants of the cause are under consideration, whether in a com-\nmittee meeting, a board meeting, or any other meeting for business,\nis not of Christ. This untimely mirth has a demoralizing tendency.\nGod is not honored when we turn everything to ridicule one day, and\nthe next day are discouraged and almost hopeless, having no light\nfrom Christ, and ready to find fault and murmur. He is pleased when\nHis people manifest solidity, strength, and firmness of character, and\nwhen they have cheerful, happy, hopeful dispositions....\nGraces of Culture and Kindness 581\nIf the mind is centered upon heavenly things, the conversation\nwill run in the same channel. The heart will overflow at the con-\ntemplation of the Christian\u2019s hope, the exceeding great and precious\npromises left on record for our encouragement; and our rejoicing in\nview of the mercy and goodness of God need not be repressed; it is\na joy that no man can take from us.\u2014The Review and Herald, June\n10, 1884.\n[See also pages 206-211, \u201cStories, Anecdotes, Jesting, and Joking.\u201d]\nJolly Ministers\u2014There is one man in your conference (I know\nnot his name) who should not be connected with the conference\nas a minister, for his influence on the minds of those seeking the\ntruth is unfavorable. He was pointed out to me, and these words [643]\nwere spoken: \u201cThe cause of God is in no need of unconverted, jolly\nministers. This man\u2019s spirit is not at all in harmony with the solemn\nwork in which we are engaged.\u201d The truth we profess to believe\nneeds no trifling men to present it. One man with a light and jovial\ndisposition will do more in leavening the churches with the same\nspirit than ten good men can do to remove the impression....\nThe converting power of God must come upon the hearts of\nthe ministers, or they should seek some other calling. If Christ\u2019s\nambassadors realize the solemnity of presenting the truth to the\npeople, they will be sober, thoughtful men, workers together with\nGod. If they have a true sense of the commission which Christ gave\nto His disciples, they will with reverence open the Word of God and\nlisten for instruction from the Lord, asking for wisdom from Heaven,\nthat as they stand between the living and the dead, they may realize\nthat they must render an account to God for the work coming forth\nfrom their hands.\nWhat can the minister do without Jesus? Verily, nothing. Then\nif he is a frivolous, joking man, he is not prepared to perform the\nduty laid upon him by the Lord. \u201cWithout Me,\u201d says Christ, \u201cye can\ndo nothing.\u201d The flippant words that fall from his lips, the trifling\nanecdotes, the words spoken to create a laugh, are all condemned by\nthe Word of God and are entirely out of place in the sacred desk....\nUnless the ministers are converted men, the churches will be\nsickly and ready to die. God\u2019s power alone can change the human\nheart and imbue it with the love of Christ. God\u2019s power alone can\ncorrect and subdue the passions and sanctify the affections. All who\n582 Evangelism\nminister must humble their proud hearts, submit their will to the will[644]\nof God, and hide their life with Christ in God.\nWhat is the object of the ministry? Is it to mix the comical with\nthe religious? The theater is the place for such exhibitions. If Christ\nis formed within, if the truth with its sanctifying power is brought\ninto the inner sanctuary of the soul, you will not have jolly men,\nneither will you have sour, cross, crabbed men to teach the precious\nlessons of Christ to perishing souls.\u2014Letter 15, 1890.\nWalking Circumspectly\u2014All the sang-froid, which is so com-\nmon, the theatrical gestures, all lightness and trifling, all jesting and\njoking, must be seen by the one who wears Christ\u2019s yoke to be \u201cnot\nconvenient\u201d\u2014an offense to God and a denial of Christ. It unfits the\nmind for solid thought and solid labor. It makes men inefficient,\nsuperficial, and spiritually diseased....\nLet every minister be sedate. As he studies the life of Christ he\nwill see the necessity of walking circumspectly. Yet he may be, and\nwill be, if connected with the Sun of Righteousness, cheerful and\nhappy, showing forth the praises of Him who hath called him out of\ndarkness into His marvelous light. The conversation will be pure,\nentirely free from all slang phrases.\u2014Manuscript 8a, 1888.\nApplication to the Work\nDevotion to His Work\u2014Christ was absorbed in the work that\nHe came to perform. His devotion to the work of saving the lost race\nwas manifest on all occasions.\u2014Manuscript 132, 1902.\nWorker\u2019s Heart Service \u2014Take up this work as the Lord\u2019s\nwork, doing it with thoughtfulness and patience. This is real service, [645]\nwhich the Master will approve. Work with a clear sense of the obli-\ngation resting upon you, knowing that angels of God are present, to\nset the seal of heaven on faithfulness, and to condemn unfaithfulness\nin any form.\nTaking hold courageously of the work that needs to be done\nand putting the heart into it, makes the work a pleasure and brings\nsuccess. Thus God is glorified....\nAs you faithfully do your work, your mind will be assimilated\nto the mind of Christ. By prayer and supplication seek for the\npromised blessing. Ask God to give you a true comprehension of\nthe work to be accomplished. Do not allow yourself to be drawn\naway or hindered by any counterinfluence. Act faithfully your part\nin bringing blessing to your fellow men. Praise God for the privilege\nof co-operating with Him in His work. As you put your whole heart\ninto the work to be done, you will enter into true companionship\nwith your fellow workers. You will see Christ in your brethren....\nAll duties are irksome into which the heart is not brought. Time\nis golden. There is a work to be done, and into the doing of this\nwork we are to put our whole hearts. The duties that God places\nin our way we are to perform, not as a cold, dreary exercise, but as\na service of love. Bring into your work your highest powers and\nsympathies. And you will find that Christ is in it. His presence will\nmake work light, and your heart will be filled with joy. You will\nwork in harmony with God, and in loyalty, love, and fidelity.\nWe are to be sincere, earnest Christians, doing faithfully the\nduties placed in our hands, and looking ever to Jesus, the author and\nfinisher of our faith. Our reward is not dependent upon our seeming [646]\n583\n584 Evangelism\nsuccess but upon the spirit in which our work is done....\nThe powers of the whole being are to be engaged in unselfish\nservice. Every talent is to be employed. Improve the future better\nthan you have the past. Put your talents out to the exchangers, for\nChrist is hungry for souls.\u2014Manuscript 20, 1905.\nEnergy and Thoroughness\u2014The Lord is not pleased to have\nHis work poorly and cheaply done, or to have it dragged along as\nthough it were a wearisome task. We have no time to squander\nin dilatory, unwilling movements. The interest we should take in\neverything that we do will make our work interesting and educat-\ning.\u2014Letter 147a, 1897.\nPersevering Energy and Close Application\u2014Where there is a\nlack of persevering energy and close application in temporal matters\nand business transactions, the same deficiency will be apparent in\nspiritual things.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:498 (1870).\nOutgeneraled by Satan \u2014After what has been shown you in\nreference to your inclination to be slow and moderate and to allow\nopportunities to pass by unimproved, you lose time, lose interest,\nand take things so moderately that Satan outgenerals you again and\nagain. It is no common indifferent work in which you are engaged\namid a people estranged from God, and who need the most zealous\nefforts made in their behalf....\nIf there is scarcely nothing to show for your labors all this time\nyou have been in the valleys, I think that you are not the man for\nthat field....\nHave you planned to make these meetings as interesting as possi-\nble? I hope that you will have the burden of the work upon your soul.\nHave you stayed by the tent, right on the ground, or have you made\na necessity of going home every day, and gathering on you burdens[647]\nthat have no part in the work? This work in God\u2019s service, to meet\nthe moral darkness, requires self-denial, toil, and persevering effort,\nand earnest faith. Many flatter themselves that they could do great\nthings if they only had the opportunity, but something has always\nprevented them; Providence has hedged their way in so that they\ncould not do what they desired to do. We expect no great opportunity\nwill meet us on the road, but by prompt and vigorous action we must\nseize the opportunities, make opportunities and master difficulties.\nApplication to the Work 585\nYou are in need of vital energy from heaven. We must in our\nwork not only strike the iron when it is hot but make the iron hot by\nstriking. Slow, easy, indolent movements will do nothing for us in\nthis work. We must be instant in season, out of season. These are\ncritical times for work. By hesitation and delay we lose many good\nopportunities....\nThat which stands most in the way of your performing duty is\nirresolution, weakness of purpose, indecision. May God help you to\ngird the armor on, and do your Master\u2019s work.\u2014Letter 13, 1886.\nDiligence\u2014Faithfulness\u2014Obedience to Leadership \u2014The\ninterests of Christ\u2019s kingdom call for diligence and faithfulness in\nas much greater degree as spiritual and eternal things are of more\nimportance than temporal things. There must be no feeble working,\nno sluggish, tardy action, for this would imperil our own souls and\nthe souls of others....\nWhat general would undertake the command of an army while\nthe officers, under him refused to obey until they had satisfied them-\nselves that his command was a reasonable one? Such a course would\nmean loss to the entire army. It would weaken the hands of the\nsoldiers. The question would arise in their minds, Is there not a [648]\nbetter way? But even though there be a better way, the orders must\nbe obeyed, or defeat and disaster would result. A moment\u2019s delay,\nand the advantage that would have been gained is lost.\nEvery good soldier is implicit and prompt in the obedience he\nrenders to his captain. The will of the commander is to be the will of\nthe soldier. Sometimes the soldier may be surprised at the command\ngiven, but he is not to stop to inquire the reason for it. When the\norder of the captain crosses the wishes of the soldier, he is not to\nhesitate and complain, saying, I see no consistency in these plans.\nHe must not frame excuses and leave his work undone. Such soldiers\nwould not be accepted as fitted to engage in earthly conflicts, and\nmuch more will they not be accepted in Christ\u2019s army. When Christ\ncommands, His soldiers must obey without hesitation. They must\nbe faithful soldiers, or He cannot accept them. Freedom of choice is\ngiven to every soul, but after a man has enlisted, he is required to be\nas true as steel, come life or come death.\u2014Manuscript 7a, 1900.\nDisciplined, Organized Mind Essential\u2014Those who teach the\nWord should not shun mental discipline. Every worker, or company\n586 Evangelism\nof workers, should by persevering effort establish such rules and\nregulations as will lead to the formation of correct habits of thought\nand action. Such a training is necessary not only for the young men\nbut for the older workers, in order that their ministry may be free\nfrom mistakes, and their sermons be clear, accurate, and convincing.\nSome minds are more like an old curiosity shop than anything\nelse. Many odd bits and ends of truth have been picked up and\nstored away there; but they know not how to present them in a clear,\nconnected manner. It is the relation that these ideas have to one[649]\nanother that gives them value. Every idea and statement should be\nas closely united as the links in a chain. When a minister throws out\na mass of matter before the people for them to pick up and arrange\nin order, his labors are lost; for there are few who will do it.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, April 6, 1886.\nMethodical Service Expedites Success \u2014There are some\nyoung men and women who have no method in doing their work.\nThough they are always busy, they can present but little results.\nThey have erroneous ideas of work, and think that they are working\nhard, when if they had practiced method in their work, and applied\nthemselves intelligently to what they had to do, they would have\naccomplished much more in a shorter time. By dallying over the\nless important matters, they find themselves hurried, perplexed, and\nconfused when they are called upon to do those duties that are more\nessential. They are always doing, and, they think, working very\nhard; and yet there is little to show for their efforts.\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, August 31, 1893.\nSystem and Promptness Save Time\u2014There must be men who\nwill begin a work in the right way, and hold to it and push it forward\nfirmly. Everything must be done according to a well-matured plan,\nand with system. God has entrusted His sacred work to men, and\nHe asks that they shall do it carefully. Regularity in all things is\nessential. Never be late to an appointment. In no department or\noffice should time be lost in unnecessary conversations. The work\nof God requires things which it does not receive, because men do\nnot learn from the God of wisdom. They press too many things\ninto their life, postpone until tomorrow that which demands their\nattention today, and much time is lost in painfully picking up the[650]\nlost stitches....\nApplication to the Work 587\nSome workers need to give up the slow methods of work which\nprevail, and to learn to be prompt. Promptness is necessary as well\nas diligence. If we wish to accomplish the work according to the will\nof God, it must be done in an expeditious manner, but not without\nthought and care.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1887.\nOrganizing Our Routine Work \u2014Persons who have not ac-\nquired habits of close industry and economy of time, should have set\nrules to prompt them to regularity and dispatch. George Washington\nwas enabled to perform a great amount of business because he was\nthorough in preserving order and regularity. Every paper had its\ndate and its place, and no time was lost in looking up what had been\nmislaid.\u2014Gospel Workers, 277, 278 (1880).\nTo Use Initiative\u2014When a laborer is set in a certain portion\nof the Lord\u2019s vineyard, his work is given him as a faithful laborer\ntogether with God to work that vineyard. He is not to wait to be told\nat every point by human minds what he must do, but plan his work\nto labor wherever he is needed. God has given you brain power to\nuse. The wants of the believers and the necessities of unbelievers are\nto be carefully studied, and your labors are to meet their necessities.\nYou are to inquire to God and not of any living man what you shall\ndo. You are a servant of the living God, and not a servant of any man.\nYou cannot do the work of God intelligently and be the shadow of\nanother man\u2019s thoughts and directions. You are under God.\u2014Letter\n8, 1895.\nPromptness Saves Confusion\u2014There is among the workers a\nlack of aptness, a confusion, a lack of mutual understanding and\npromptness. Things are not done on time. As a result, complications [651]\nand difficulties arise, which it is hard to overcome from a lack of\nunited action. This state of things, if it is not remedied, will be seen\nand felt still more in the future than in the past, for the work will\ngrow and the need of a perfect understanding of affairs in this house\nwill become greater. The unfortunate habit of neglecting a special\nwork which needs to be done at a certain time trebles the difficulty\nof performing it later with exactness and without leaving something\nneglected or unfinished.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1887.\nRising at Regular Time \u2014Some youth are much opposed to\norder and discipline. They do not respect the rules of the home\nby rising at a regular hour. They lie in bed some hours after day-\n588 Evangelism\nlight, when everyone should be astir. They burn the midnight oil,\ndepending upon artificial light to supply the place of the light that\nnature has provided at seasonable hours. In so doing they not only\nwaste precious opportunities but cause additional expense. But in\nalmost every case the plea is made, \u201cI cannot get through my work;\nI have something to do; I cannot retire early.\u201d Thus they are sleeping\nsoundly when they should be awake with nature and the early-rising\nbirds. The precious habits of order are broken; and the moments\nthus idled away in the early morning set things out of course for the\nwhole day.\nOur God is a God of order, and He desires that His children shall\nwill to bring themselves into order, and under His discipline. Would\nit not be better, therefore, to break up this habit of turning night into\nday, and the fresh hours of the morning into night?\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, January 28, 1897.\nAdvantages Through Proper Timing\u2014The timing of things\nmay tell much in favor of truth. Victories are frequently lost through[652]\ndelays. There will be crises in this cause. Prompt and decisive\naction at the right time will gain glorious triumphs, while delay\nand neglect will result in great failures and positive dishonor to\nGod.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:498 (1875).\nValue of Using Memorandum Book\u2014If the youth would form\nhabits of regularity and order, they would improve in health, in\nspirits, in memory, and in disposition.\nIt is the duty of all to observe strict rules in their habits of life.\nThis is for your own good, dear youth, both physically and morally.\nWhen you rise in the morning, take into consideration, as far as\npossible, the work you must accomplish during the day. If necessary,\nhave a small book in which to jot down the things that need to\nbe done, and set yourself a time in which to do your work.\u2014The\nYouth\u2019s Instructor, January 28, 1897.\nWork Not Confined to Certain Hours \u2014The eight-hour sys-\ntem finds no place in the program of the minister of God. He must\nhold himself in readiness for service at any hour.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n451 (1915).\nSaviour\u2019s Evening Work\u2014All day He ministered to those who\ncame to Him; in the evening He gave attention to such as through the\nApplication to the Work 589\nday must toil to earn a pittance for the support of their families.\u2014The\nMinistry of Healing, 18 (1905).\nEarnest Labor Helps Answer Prayer\u2014While we are to pray\nfor God\u2019s blessing, we are to second our prayers by most diligent,\nthorough, earnest labor.\u2014Manuscript 25, 1895.\nNot to Depend on Miracles\u2014God does not generally work mir-\nacles to advance His truth. If the husbandman neglects to cultivate\nthe soil after sowing his seed, God works no miracle to counteract [653]\nthe sure result of neglect. In the harvest he will find his field barren.\nGod works according to great principles which He has presented to\nthe human family, and it is our part to mature wise plans, and set in\noperation the means whereby God shall bring about certain results.\nThose who make no decided effort, but simply wait for the Holy\nSpirit to compel them to action, will perish in darkness. We would\nask those who are waiting for a miracle, What means have been\ntried which God has placed within your reach? We would ask those\nwho are hoping for some supernatural work to be done, who simply\nsay, \u201cBelieve, believe,\u201d Have you submitted yourself to the revealed\ncommand of God? The Lord has said, \u201cThou shalt,\u201d and, \u201cThou\nshalt not.\u201d\nLet all study the parable of the talents, and realize that to every\nman God has given his work\u2014to every man He has entrusted his\ntalents, that by exercising his ability, he may increase his efficiency.\nYou are not to sit still, and do nothing in the work of God.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, September 28, 1897.\nBe Not Slothful\u2014Labor for those who are loitering away their\nlives, accomplishing only half of what they might for the Master.\nStrive to arouse them to a sense of their responsibility. Pray for\nand exhort one another, and so much the more as ye see the day\napproaching. Let brother say to brother and sister to sister, \u201cCome,\nmy fellow laborer, let us put all earnestness into our work; for the\nnight is at hand, wherein no man can work.\u201d Let no one lose minutes\nby talking when he should be working.\nLet the talkative man remember that there are times when he has\nno right to talk. There are those who take time to stand still. Let [654]\nthe voice of the faithful sentinel be heard, \u201cNot slothful in business;\nfervent in spirit; serving the Lord.\u201d Have you work to do for the\nMaster? Is it building a house in which His work may be carried\n590 Evangelism\nforward? Close your lips. Make not others idle by tempting them\nto listen to your talk. The time of many is lost when a man uses his\ntongue instead of his tools.\u2014Manuscript 42, 1901.\nMinisters Not to Engage in Secular Affairs\u2014I wish to say to\nBrethren _____ and _____ that their work is largely among unbe-\nlievers. Those who are successful expositors of Bible truth are to\nstand before those who have not heard the message for this time.\nThese brethren whose names I have mentioned have a work to do in\nour camp meetings, which are to be held in the large cities. But they\nare in danger of disqualifying themselves for doing the work that\nGod has given them to do. Elder _____ will surely lose his bearings\nunless he ceases to interest himself in work that God does not re-\nquire him to do, work that demands attention to business details. By\nengaging in secular work he would not be doing that which has been\nappointed him by God. The proclamation of the gospel message will\nbe his light and life.\u2014Manuscript 105, 1902.\nWith an Eye Single to the Glory of God\u2014It is Satan\u2019s regular\nemployment to hinder the work of God, and to work for the destruc-\ntion of the race. Frequently when the interest in a certain locality\nis at its height, he makes it appear to the mind of the worker that\nsome trifling matter at home is of great importance, and demands\nhis immediate presence. The eye of the worker not being single to\nthe glory of God, he leaves the work unfinished, and rushes home.\nHe may be kept away for days and even weeks, and his former work[655]\nbecomes raveled and tangled. Stitch after stitch is dropped, never to\nbe taken up again. This pleases the enemy. And when he sees that\nhe is successful in making temporal matters supreme in the mind of\nthis person, he gives him his hands full of trouble. He at once begins\nto manufacture home difficulties, so as to entangle his mind, and, if\npossible, to keep him away from the work altogether....\nWhen souls are deciding for or against the truth, do not, I beseech\nyou, allow yourselves to be drawn away from your field of labor.\nDo not abandon it to the enemy, I might say, even if one lay dead\nin your house. Christ said, \u201cFollow me; and let the dead bury their\ndead.\u201d If you could only see the importance of the work as it has\nbeen presented to me, the paralysis that is upon many would be\nshaken off, and there would be a rising from the dead and a coming\nto life through Jesus Christ....\nApplication to the Work 591\nIf we firmly take our stand as God\u2019s workmen, saying, \u201cThe\nLord has given us a message, and we cannot be faithful watchmen\nunless we stand at our post of duty; we will carry the work through\nat all hazards,\u201d then we shall find that angels of God will minister to\nour households at home, and will say to the enemy, \u201cStand back.\u201d\u2014\nHistorical Sketches, 127, 128 (1886).\nConcentrating on the Main Task\nSouls Lost Because of Divided Efforts\u2014Some ministers have\ngiven themselves to the work of writing during a period of decided\nreligious interest, and it has frequently been the case that their writ-\nings have had no special connection with the work in hand. This\nis a glaring error; for at such times it is the duty of the minister to[656]\nuse his entire strength in pushing forward the cause of God. His\nmind should be clear, and centered upon the one object of saving\nsouls. Should his thoughts be preoccupied with other subjects, many\nmight be lost to the cause who could have been saved by timely\ninstruction.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:265 (1876).\nLoss Through Divided Effort \u2014Your mistake has been this:\nJust as soon as you enter upon an effort, you begin to do much\nwriting. Now if your part of the work is to write, if God has said\nto you, as He did to John, \u201cWrite these things,\u201d then give yourself\nto that, and do not attempt more. If you are to give discourses,\nyour mind is not vigorous enough, although intensely active, to\nsustain the strain of speaking and visiting and writing. You should\nlet your mind rest in a great degree when you engage in an effort to\npresent new and startling truths to the people, the reception of which\ninvolves a cross. You need to carefully select your subject, make\nyour discourses short, and important points of doctrine very plain....\nIn order to make a success in this work you must do one thing at\na time, concentrate your powers upon that one work. Your judgment\nin this direction is at fault. When you begin to give a series of\ndiscourses, make these discourses the main business. Do not begin to\nwrite letters and articles for the papers; for you divide your strength\nin doing this. Elder _____ and Elder ______ were corrected in this\nmatter. The Lord showed me that the important work of presenting\nthe truth was being marred in their hands; not one-half the strength\nwas brought into their work, because of their devoting so much time\nto letter writing. The visiting is the important part of the labor;\nbut the time of these brethren was occupied in almost constant\n592\nConcentrating on the Main Task 593\nwriting, which wearied them, occupied their time, and did not help [657]\nthe present work, but hindered it. The people were robbed of the\nclear, convincing exposition of Scripture, and the devotional part of\nthe work was neglected....\nNow the reason: Out of the desk they employed much of their\ntime in writing, excusing themselves from visiting because they\nwere so busy and so tired. As the result they were brain weary\nwhen they came into the desk; they were not prepared to do a work\nthat God could set His seal upon. They made nothing clear. Yet\nif they worked themselves up to a high pitch of excitement they\nthought their discourses were powerful. They touched here and there,\nbringing a large mass of matter which they regarded as convincing\nand overwhelming evidence, but in fact they buried the truth under a\nmass of matter poured out upon the hearers, so that the points never\ncould be found. Everything they presented was muddled. So many\nsubjects were brought into one discourse that no point stood proved\nand clear in the minds of those unacquainted with the truth.... One\nsubject, a few points made plain and clear, would be of more value\nto the hearer than this mass of matter which you may call evidence,\nand think your points substantiated.\u2014Letter 47, 1886.\nHealth and Health Principles\n[See also The Medical Evangelist, 513-551.]\nEvangelists Tempted to Be Careless of Health \u2014Satan is at\nwork to destroy. He would lead the minds of those who love God\nand are preaching the gospel to be careless of their physical health,\nfor this has a great deal to do with the general standard of virtue.[658]\nMinisters give too much time to preaching, and exhaust their vital\nforces.... It is the many long discourses that weary. One half of the\ngospel food presented would tell to much better advantage.\u2014Letter\n91, 1898.\nThe Strain of Evangelism\u2014Your Sunday night meetings are a\nheavy strain on you, for you allow yourself to become wrought up\nto a high tension. Then, afterward, a corresponding reaction comes,\nand as a result your association with the church does not bring peace\nand righteousness....\nThe tremendous efforts you make in preparing for your meetings\ndo not accomplish the work that is most needed. You may be praised\nand exalted by men, but this is no evidence that your work exerts the\nright influence.\nThus saith the Lord, \u201cYou must guard against becoming wrought\nup to a high tension in preparing to speak to the people.\u201d\u2014Letter\n51, 1902.\nTemperance in God\u2019s Work\u2014The servants of Christ are not\nto treat their health indifferently. Let no one labor to the point of\nexhaustion, thereby disqualifying himself for future effort. Do not\ntry to crowd into one day the work of two. At the end, those who\nwork carefully and wisely will be found to have accomplished as\nmuch as those who so expend their physical and mental strength that\nthey have no deposit from which to draw in time of need.\u2014Gospel\nWorkers, 244 (1915).\nLabor Intelligently\u2014Every worker should labor intelligently,\nwith an eye single to the glory of God. He should take special care\nnot to abuse any of his God-given faculties.\n594\nHealth and Health Principles 595\nThe Lord would have you, my brother, reform in your method [659]\nof labor, that you may have a well-balanced mind, a symmetrical\ncharacter, and spiritual strength to counsel wisely. Men who have\nexperience in the knowledge of the truth are too few for you to be\nsacrificed. You are almost constantly overtaxing both your physical\nand mental powers, because you allow yourself to feel too intensely.\nYou have a vivid imagination, and put much intensity into your\npreaching, which keeps the mind on a constant strain, with the voice\nraised to a high pitch, and not only are you wearied, but the people\nare annoyed and their interest lessened. The reaction is sure to come;\nfor you do not know how to let yourself down gradually from such\na strain, and the poor mortal body feels the wear. A corresponding\ndepression follows the high pressure.\nYou should not allow yourself to make your labors unnecessarily\nsevere. You tax yourself in writing as well as in speaking. God does\nnot require this. Observe strictly the laws of health, and you will be\nfresh to do good work for the Master; you will have fresh manna to\nfeed the sheep in Christ\u2019s pasture.\u2014Letter 39, 1887.\nAllow for Needed Periods of Rest\u2014Some of our ministers feel\nthat they must every day perform some labor that they can report to\nthe conference. And as the result of trying to do this, their efforts\nare too often weak and inefficient. They should have periods of rest,\nof entire freedom from taxing labor. But these cannot take the place\nof daily physical exercise.\u2014Gospel Workers, 240 (1915).\nPreparing for Future Duties\u2014When a laborer has been under\na heavy pressure of care and anxiety, and is overworked in both\nbody and mind, he should turn aside and rest a while, not for selfish\ngratification, but that he may be better prepared for future duties. We [660]\nhave a vigilant foe, who is ever on our track, ready to take advantage\nof every weakness that would help to make his temptations effective.\nWhen the mind is overstrained and the body enfeebled, he presses\nupon the soul his fiercest temptations. Let the laborer carefully\nhusband his strength, and when wearied with toil, let him turn aside\nand commune with Jesus.\u2014Gospel Workers, 245 (1915).\nAvoid Strain of Overwork\u2014I hear of workers whose health\nis breaking down under the strain of the burdens they are bearing.\nThis ought not to be. God desires us to remember that we are\nmortal. We are not to embrace too much in our work. We are not\n596 Evangelism\nto keep ourselves under such a strain that our physical and mental\npowers shall be exhausted. More workers are needed, that some\nof the burdens may be removed from those now so heavily loaded\ndown.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 28, 1904.\nTime for Relaxation, Exercise, and Family Responsibili-\nties\u2014If a minister, during his leisure time, engages in labor in\nhis orchard or garden, shall he deduct that time from his salary?\nCertainly not, any more than he should put in his time when he is\ncalled to work over hours in ministerial labor. Some ministers spend\nmany hours in apparent ease, and it is right that they should rest\nwhen they can; for the system could not endure the heavy strain\nwere there no time for letting up. There are hours in the day that call\nfor severe taxation, for which the minister receives no extra salary,\nand if he chooses to chop wood several hours a day, or work in his\ngarden, it is as much his privilege to do this as to preach. A minister\ncannot always be preaching and visiting, for this is exhaustive work.\nThe light given me is that if our ministers would do more physical[661]\nlabor, they would reap blessings healthwise. After his day\u2019s work\nof preaching and visiting and study, the minister should have time\nin which to attend to his own necessities. If he has only a limited\nsalary, he may contrive to add to his little fund. The narrow-minded\nmay see in this something to criticize, but the Lord commends such\na course.\nI have been shown that at times those in the ministry are com-\npelled to labor day and night and live on very meager fare. When\na crisis comes, every nerve and sinew is taxed by the heavy strain.\nIf these men could go aside and rest a while, engaging in physical\nlabor, it would be a great relief. Thus men might have been saved\nwho have gone down to the grave. It is a positive necessity to physi-\ncal health and mental clearness to do some manual work during the\nday. Thus the blood is called from the brain to other portions of the\nbody.\u2014Letter 168, 1899.\nContinual Improvement\u2014Our ministers who have reached the\nage of forty or fifty years should not feel that their labor is less\nefficient than formerly. Men of years and experience are just the\nones to put forth strong and well-directed efforts. They are specially\nneeded at this time; the churches cannot afford to part with them.\nHealth and Health Principles 597\nSuch ones should not talk of physical and mental feebleness, nor\nfeel that their day of usefulness is over.\nMany of them have suffered from severe mental taxation, un-\nrelieved by physical exercise. The result is a deterioration of their\npowers, and a tendency to shirk responsibilities. What they need is\nmore active labor. This is not alone confined to those whose heads\nare white with the frost of time, but men young in years have fallen\ninto the same state, and have become mentally feeble. They have a\nlist of set discourses; but if they get beyond the boundaries of these, [662]\nthey lose their soundings.\nThe old-fashioned pastor, who traveled on horseback, and spent\nmuch time in visiting his flock, enjoyed much better health, notwith-\nstanding his hardships and exposures, than our ministers of today,\nwho avoid all physical exertion as far as possible, and confine them-\nselves to their books.\nMinisters of age and experience should feel it their duty, as God\u2019s\nhired servants, to go forward, progressing every day, continually\nbecoming more efficient in their work, and constantly gathering\nfresh matter to set before the people. Each effort to expound the\ngospel should be an improvement upon that which preceded it. Each\nyear they should develop a deeper piety, a tenderer spirit, a greater\nspirituality, and a more thorough knowledge of Bible truth. The\ngreater their age and experience, the nearer should they be able to\napproach the hearts of the people, having a more perfect knowledge\nof them.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:269, 270 (1876).\nFinancial Worries\u2014When ministers and teachers, pressed un-\nder the burden of financial responsibilities, enter the pulpit or the\nschoolroom with wearied brain and overtaxed nerves, what else can\nbe expected than that common fire will be used instead of the sacred\nfire of God\u2019s kindling? The strained, tattered efforts disappoint the\nlisteners and hurt the speaker. He has had no time to seek the Lord,\nno time to ask in faith for the unction of the Holy Spirit.\u2014Testi-\nmonies For The Church 7:250, 251 (1902).\nAvoiding Long Committees at Night\u2014A minister cannot keep\nin the best spiritual frame of mind while he is called upon to settle\nlittle difficulties in the various churches. This is not his appointed\nwork. God desires to use every faculty of His chosen messengers. [663]\nTheir mind should not be wearied by long committee meetings at\n598 Evangelism\nnight; for God wants all their brain power to be used in proclaiming\nthe gospel as it is in Christ Jesus.\nOverburdened, a minister is often so hurried that he scarcely finds\ntime to examine himself whether he be in the faith. He finds very\nlittle time to meditate and pray. Christ in His ministry united prayer\nwith work. Night after night He spent wholly in prayer. Ministers\nmust seek God for His Holy Spirit, in order that they may present\nthe truth aright.\u2014Manuscript 127, 1902.\nA Firm Stand-an Appeal to a Popular Evangelist \u2014It has\nbeen clearly presented to me that God\u2019s people are to take a firm\nstand against meat eating. Would God for thirty years give His\npeople the message that if they desire to have pure blood and clear\nminds, they must give up the use of flesh meat, if He did not want\nthem to heed this message? By the use of flesh meat the animal\nnature is strengthened and the spiritual nature weakened. Such men\nas you, who are engaged in the most solemn and important work\never entrusted to human beings, need to give special heed to what\nthey eat.\nRemember that when you eat flesh meat, you are but eating\ngrains and vegetables secondhand; for the animal receives from\nthese things the nutrition that makes it grow and prepares it for\nmarket. The life that was in the grains and vegetables passes into\nthe animal, and becomes part of its life, and then human beings eat\nthe animal. Why are they so willing to eat their food secondhand?\nIn the beginning, fruit was pronounced by God as \u201cgood for\nfood.\u201d The permission to eat flesh meat was a consequence of the[664]\nfall. Not till after the Flood was man given permission to eat the\nflesh of animals. Why, then, need we eat flesh meat? Few who eat\nthis know how full it is of disease. Flesh meat never was the best\nfood, and now it is cursed by disease.\nThe thought of killing animals to be eaten is in itself revolting.\nIf man\u2019s natural sense had not been perverted by the indulgence\nof appetite, human beings would not think of eating the flesh of\nanimals.\nWe have been given the work of advancing health reform. The\nLord desires His people to be in harmony with one another. As you\nmust know, we shall not leave the position in which, for the last\nthirty-five years, the Lord has been bidding us stand. Beware how\nHealth and Health Principles 599\nyou place yourself in opposition to the work of health reform. It will\ngo forward, for it is the Lord\u2019s means of lessening the suffering in\nour world and of purifying His people.\nBe careful what attitude you assume, lest you be found causing\ndivision. My brother, even while you fail to bring into your life\nand into your family the blessing that comes from following the\nprinciples of health reform, do not harm others by opposing the light\nGod has given on this subject.\nWhile we do not make the use of flesh meat a test, while we\ndo not want to force anyone to give up its use, yet it is our duty\nto request that no minister of the conference shall make light of or\noppose the message of reform on this point. If, in the face of the light\nGod has given concerning the effect of meat eating on the system,\nyou will still continue to eat meat, you must bear the consequences.\nBut do not take a position before the people that will permit them to\nthink that it is not necessary to call for a reform in regard to meat [665]\neating, because the Lord is calling for reform. The Lord has given\nus the work of proclaiming the message of health reform, and if\nyou cannot step forward in the ranks of those who are giving this\nmessage, you are not to make this prominent. In counterworking the\nefforts of your fellow laborers who are teaching health reform, you\nare out of order, working on the wrong side.\u2014Letter 48, 1902.\nThe Voice of the Gospel Worker\nMinister God\u2019s Mouthpiece\u2014The man who accepts the posi-\ntion of being mouthpiece for God should consider it highly essential\nthat he present the truth with all the grace and intelligence he can,\nthat the truth may lose nothing in his presentation of it to the peo-\nple. Those who consider it a little thing to speak with an imperfect\nutterance dishonor God.\u2014Manuscript 107, 1898.\nIn Full, Round Tones\u2014The ability to speak plainly and clearly,\nin full, round tones, is invaluable in any line of work. This quali-\nfication is indispensable in those who desire to become ministers,\nevangelists, Bible workers, or canvassers. Those who are planning\nto enter these lines of work should be taught to use the voice in such\na way that when they speak to people about the truth, a decided\nimpression for good will be made. The truth must not be marred by\nbeing communicated through defective utterance.\u2014Testimonies For\nThe Church 6:380 (1900).\nSpeaking Clearly With Expression\u2014All the workers, whether\nthey speak from the pulpit or give Bible readings, are to be taught to\nspeak in a clear, expressive manner.\u2014Letter 200, 1903.\nBible Reader\u2019s Voice Soft and Musical\u2014The one who gives[666]\nBible readings in the congregation or in the family should be able to\nread with a soft, musical cadence which will charm the hearers.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 6:381 (1900).\nConvincingly and Impressively\u2014The science of reading cor-\nrectly and with the proper emphasis, is of highest value. No matter\nhow much knowledge you may have acquired in other lines, if you\nhave neglected to cultivate your voice and manner of speech so that\nyou can speak and read distinctly and intelligently, all your learn-\ning will be of but little profit; for without voice culture you cannot\ncommunicate readily and clearly that which you have learned.\nTo learn to tell convincingly and impressively that which one\nknows, is of special value to those who desire to become workers\nin the cause of God. The more expression you can put into words\n600\nVoice of the Gospel Worker 601\nof truth, the more effective these words will be on those who hear.\nA proper presentation of the Lord\u2019s truth is worthy of our highest\nefforts. Let the students in training for the Master\u2019s service make\ndetermined efforts to learn to speak correctly and forcibly, in order\nthat when conversing with others in regard to the truth, or when\nengaged in public ministry, they may properly present the truths of\nheavenly origin.\u2014Manuscript 131, 1902.\nVoice of Speaker Affects Decision\u2014Some destroy the solemn\nimpression they may have made upon the people, by raising their\nvoices to a very high pitch, and hallooing and screaming out the truth.\nWhen presented in this manner, truth loses much of its sweetness, its\nforce and solemnity. But if the voice is toned right, if it has solemnity,\nand is so modulated as to be even pathetic, it will produce a much [667]\nbetter impression. This was the tone in which Christ taught His\ndisciples. He impressed them with solemnity; He spoke in a pathetic\nmanner. But this loud hallooing\u2014what does it do? It does not give\nthe people any more exalted views of the truth, and does not impress\nthem any more deeply. It only causes a disagreeable sensation to the\nhearers, and wears out the vocal organs of the speaker. The tones\nof the voice have much to do in affecting the hearts of those that\nhear.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:615 (1871).\nProper Use of Vocal Organs\u2014Careful attention and training\nshould be given to the vocal organs. They are strengthened by right\nuse, but become enfeebled if used improperly. Their excessive use,\nas in preaching long sermons, will, if often repeated, not only injure\nthe organs of speech, but will bring an undue strain upon the whole\nnervous system. The delicate harp of a thousand strings becomes\nworn, gets out of repair, and produces discord instead of melody.\nIt is important for every speaker so to train the vocal organs as\nto keep them in a healthful condition, that he may speak forth the\nwords of life to the people. Everyone should become intelligent as to\nthe most effective manner of using his God-given ability, and should\npractice what he learns. It is not necessary to talk in a loud voice or\nupon a high key; this does great injury to the speaker. Rapid talking\ndestroys much of the effect of a discourse; for the words cannot be\nmade so plain and distinct as if spoken more deliberately, giving the\nhearer time to take in the meaning of every word.\n602 Evangelism\nThe human voice is a precious gift of God; it is a power for good,\nand the Lord wants His servants to preserve its pathos and melody.[668]\nThe voice should be cultivated so as to promote its musical quality,\nthat it may fall pleasantly upon the ear and impress the heart....\nThe Lord requires the human agent not to move by impulse in\nspeaking, but to move calmly, speak slowly, and let the Holy Spirit\ngive efficiency to the truth. Never think that in working yourselves\nup to a passion of delivery, speaking by impulse, and suffering your\nfeelings to raise your voice to an unnaturally high key, that you are\ngiving evidence of the great power of God upon you....\nYour influence is to be far reaching, and your powers of speech\nshould be under the control of reason. When you strain the organs of\nspeech, the modulations of the voice are lost. The tendency to rapid\nspeaking should be decidedly overcome. God claims of the human\ninstrumentality all the service that man can give. All the talents\nentrusted to the human agent are to be cherished and appreciated,\nand used as a precious endowment of heaven. The laborers in the\nharvest field are God\u2019s appointed agents, channels through which He\ncan communicate light from heaven. The careless, improvident use\nof any of their God-given powers lessens their efficiency so that in an\nemergency, when the greatest good might be done, they are so weak\nand sickly and crippled that they can accomplish but little.\u2014Special\nTestimonies, Series A, No. 7, pp. 9-11. (1874).\nVoice Culture Important to Minister \u2014The teachers in our\nschools should not tolerate in the students ungainly attitudes and\nuncouth gestures, wrong intonations in reading, or incorrect accents\nor emphasis. Perfection of speech and voice should be urged upon\nevery student. Because of carelessness and bad training, habits are[669]\noften contracted which are great hindrances in the work of a minister\nwho has otherwise educated talent. The student must be impressed\nthat he has it in his power, by combining grace with effort, to make\nhimself a man. The mental and physical capabilities with which God\nhas adorned him may by cultivation and painstaking effort become\na power to benefit his fellow men.\u2014Manuscript 22, 1886.\nTraining the Voice\u2014The training of the voice has an important\nplace in physical culture, since it tends to expand and strengthen the\nlungs, and thus to ward off disease. To ensure correct delivery in\nreading and speaking, see that the abdominal muscles have full play\nVoice of the Gospel Worker 603\nin breathing, and that the respiratory organs are unrestricted. Let\nthe strain come on the muscles of the abdomen, rather than on those\nof the throat. Great weariness and serious disease of the throat and\nlungs may thus be prevented. Careful attention should be given to\nsecuring distinct articulation, smooth, well-modulated tones, and a\nnot-too-rapid delivery.\u2014Education, 199 (1903).\nSpeak to Thousands as Easily as Ten \u2014Speaking from the\nthroat, letting the words come out from the upper extremity of the\nvocal organs, all the time fretting and irritating them, is not the\nbest way to preserve health or to increase the efficiency of those\norgans. You should take a full inspiration, and let the action come\nfrom the abdominal muscles. Let the lungs be only the channel,\nbut do not depend upon them to do the work. If you let your words\ncome from deep down, exercising the abdominal muscles, you can\nspeak to thousands with just as much ease as you can speak to\nten.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:616 (1871).\nObserve Proper Breathing\u2014Ministers should stand erect, and [670]\nspeak slowly, firmly, and distinctly, taking a full inspiration of air at\nevery sentence, and throwing out the words by exercising the abdom-\ninal muscles. If they will observe this simple rule, giving attention\nto the laws of health in other respects, they may preserve their life\nand usefulness much longer than men in any other profession. The\nchest will become broader, and ... the speaker need seldom become\nhoarse, even by constant speaking. Instead of becoming consump-\ntives, ministers may, by exercising care, overcome all tendency to\nconsumption,\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:404 (1880).\nSpeaking Slowly and Calmly\u2014In my younger days I used to\ntalk too loud. The Lord has shown me that I could not make the\nproper impression upon the people by getting the voice to an unnat-\nural pitch. Then Christ was presented before me, and His manner\nof talking; and there was a sweet melody in His voice. His voice,\nin a slow, calm manner, reached those who listened, and His words\npenetrated their hearts, and they were able to catch on to what He\nsaid before the next sentence was spoken. Some seem to think they\nmust race right straight along or else they will lose the inspiration\nand the people will lose the inspiration. If that is inspiration, let\nthem lose it, and the sooner the better.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nPersonal Appearance of the Evangelist\nPersonality of the Evangelist\u2014From the light I have had, the\nministry is a sacred and exalted office, and those who accept this\nposition should have Christ in their hearts, and manifest an earnest[671]\ndesire to represent Him worthily before the people, in all their acts, in\ntheir dress, in their speaking, and even in their manner of speaking....\nOur words, our actions, our deportment, our dress, everything,\nshould preach. Not only with our words should we speak to the\npeople, but everything pertaining to our person should be a sermon\nto them.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:615, 618 (1871).\nSouls Lost Because of Carelessness\u2014A minister who is neg-\nligent in his apparel often wounds those of good taste and refined\nsensibilities. Those who are faulty in this respect should correct\ntheir errors, and be more circumspect. The loss of some souls at last\nwill be traced to the untidiness of the minister. The first appearance\naffected the people unfavorably, because they could not in any way\nlink his appearance with the truths he presented. His dress was\nagainst him; and the impression given was that the people whom\nhe represented were a careless set who cared nothing about their\ndress, and his hearers did not want anything to do with such a class\nof people.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:613 (1871).\nTaste, Color, and Fit\u2014Some who minister in sacred things so\narrange their dress upon their persons, that, to some extent at least,\nit destroys the influence of their labor. There is an apparent lack\nof taste in color and neatness of fit. What is the impression given\nby such a manner of dress? It is, that the work in which they are\nengaged is considered no more sacred or elevated than common\nlabor, as plowing in the field. The minister, by his example, brings\ndown sacred things upon a level with common things.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 2:614 (1871).\nChoice of Colors \u2014Black or dark material is more becoming[672]\nto a minister in the desk, and will make a better impression upon\nthe people, than would be made by a combination of two or three\n604\nPersonal Appearance of the Evangelist 605\ndifferent colors in his apparel.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 2:610\n(1871).\nPropriety of Dress and Behavior\u2014In dress and behavior we\nare to reveal propriety. Never are we to be slack or untidy in our\nappearance or our work.\u2014Letter 49, 1902.\nCharacter of the Woman Worker Judged by Dress\u2014A per-\nson\u2019s character is judged by his style of dress. A refined taste, a\ncultivated mind, will be revealed in the choice of simple and appro-\npriate attire. Chaste simplicity in dress, when united with modesty\nof demeanor, will go far toward surrounding a young woman with\nthat atmosphere of sacred reserve which will be to her a shield from\na thousand perils.\u2014Education, 248.(1903).\nUnbelievers Appreciate Simplicity of Dress\u2014Many dress like\nthe world, in order to have an influence over unbelievers; but here\nthey make a sad mistake. If they would have a true and saving\ninfluence, let them live out their profession, show their faith by\ntheir righteous works, and make the distinction plain between the\nChristian and the worldling. The words, the dress, the actions,\nshould tell for God. Then a holy influence will be shed upon all\naround them, and even unbelievers will take knowledge of them that\nthey have been with Jesus. If any wish to have their influence tell in\nfavor of truth, let them live out their profession, and thus imitate the\nhumble Pattern.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:633, 634 (1881).\nPride of Dress Stumbling Block to Unbelievers\u2014Many a soul\nwho was convinced of the truth has been led to decide against it [673]\nby the pride and love of the world displayed by our sisters. The\ndoctrine preached seemed clear and harmonious, and the hearers felt\nthat a heavy cross must be lifted by them in taking the truth. When\nthese persons have seen our sisters making so much display in dress,\nthey have said, \u201cThis people dress fully as much as we do. They\ncannot really believe what they profess; and, after all, they must be\ndeceived. If they really thought that Christ was soon coming, and\nthe case of every soul was to be decided for eternal life or death, they\ncould not devote time and money to dress according to the existing\nfashions.\u201d How little did those professedly believing sisters know of\nthe sermon their dress was preaching!\nOur words, our actions, and our dress are daily, living preachers,\ngathering with Christ, or scattering abroad. This is no trivial matter,\n606 Evangelism\nto be passed off with a jest. The subject of dress demands serious\nreflection and much prayer. Many unbelievers have felt that they\nwere not doing right in permitting themselves to be slaves of fashion;\nbut when they see some who make a high profession of godliness\ndressing as worldlings dress, enjoying frivolous society, they decide\nthat there can be no wrong in such a course.\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 4:641 (1881).\nSimple Attire Will Not Embarrass Poor\u2014Our clothing should\nbe plain and simple, so that when we visit the poor, they will not\nbe embarrassed by the contrast between our appearance and their\nown.\u2014Gospel Workers, 189 (1915).\nDress Befitting Sacred Profession\u2014Carefulness in dress is an\nimportant consideration. The minister should be clothed in a manner\nbefitting the dignity of his position. Some ministers have failed in\nthis respect. In some cases not only has there been a lack of taste[674]\nand of orderly arrangement in the dress, but the clothing has been\nuntidy and slovenly.\nThe God of heaven, whose arm moves the world, who gives us\nlife and sustains us in health, is honored or dishonored by the apparel\nof those who officiate in His honor.\u2014Gospel Workers, 173 (1915).\nThe Evangelist\u2019s Wife\nResponsible for Her Talents\u2014A responsibility rests upon the\nminister\u2019s wife which she should not and cannot lightly throw off.\nGod will require the talent lent her, with usury. She should work\nearnestly, faithfully, and unitedly with her husband to save souls.\nShe should never urge her wishes and desires, or express a lack of\ninterest in her husband\u2019s labor, or dwell upon homesick, discontented\nfeelings. All these natural feelings must be overcome. She should\nhave a purpose in life which should be unfalteringly carried out.\nWhat if this conflicts with the feelings and pleasures and natural\ntastes! These should be cheerfully and readily sacrificed, in order to\ndo good and save souls.\nThe wives of ministers should live devoted, prayerful lives. But\nsome would enjoy a religion in which there are no crosses, and\nwhich calls for no self-denial and exertion on their part. Instead of\nstanding nobly for themselves, leaning upon God for strength, and\nbearing their individual responsibility, they have much of the time\nbeen dependent upon others, deriving their spiritual life from them.\nIf they would only lean confidingly, in childlike trust, upon God,\nand have their affections centered in Jesus, deriving their life from\nChrist, the living vine, what an amount of good they might do, what\na help they might be to others, what a support to their husbands; and [675]\nwhat a reward would be theirs in the end!\u2014Testimonies For The\nChurch 1:452, 453 (1864).\nTo Accompany Husband in Soul Winning \u2014If a minister\u2019s\nwife accompanies her husband in his travels, she should not go for\nher own special enjoyment, to visit and to be waited upon, but to\nlabor with him. She should have a united interest with him to do\ngood. She should be willing to accompany her husband, if home\ncares do not hinder, and she should aid him in his efforts to save souls.\nWith meekness and humility, yet with a noble self-reliance, she\nshould have a leading influence upon minds around her, and should\nact her part and bear her cross and burden in meeting, and around the\n607\n608 Evangelism\nfamily altar, and in conversation at the fireside. The people expect\nthis, and they have a right to expect it. If these expectations are not\nrealized, the husband\u2019s influence is more than half destroyed.\nThe wife of a minister can do much if she will. If she possesses\nthe spirit of self-sacrifice, and has a love for souls, she can with him\ndo almost an equal amount of good. A sister-laborer in the cause\nof truth can understand and reach some cases, especially among\nthe sisters, that the minister cannot.\u2014Testimonies For The Church\n1:452 (1864).\nDress of Ministers\u2019 Wives\u2014Especially should the wives of our\nministers be careful not to depart from the plain teachings of the\nBible on the point of dress. Many look upon these injunctions as too\nold fashioned to be worthy of notice; but He who gave them to His\ndisciples understood the dangers from the love of dress in our time,\nand sent to us the note of warning. Will we heed the warning and\nbe wise? Extravagance in dress is continually increasing. The end\nis not yet. Fashion is constantly changing, and our sisters follow in[676]\nits wake, regardless of time or expense. There is a great amount of\nmeans expended upon dress, when it should be returned to God the\ngiver.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 4:630, 631 (1881).\nExample of Home Religion\u2014Let the minister\u2019s wife who has\nchildren remember that in her home she has a missionary field in\nwhich she should labor with untiring energy and unflagging zeal,\nknowing that the results of her work will endure throughout eternity.\nAre not the souls of her children of as much value as the souls\nof the heathen? Then let her tend them with loving care. She is\ncharged with the responsibility of showing to the world the power\nand excellence of home religion. She is to be controlled by principle,\nnot by impulse, and she is to work with the consciousness that God\nis her helper. She is to allow nothing to divert her from her mission.\nThe influence of the mother who has a close connection with\nChrist is of infinite worth. Her ministry of love makes the home a\nBethel. Christ works with her, turning the common water of life into\nthe wine of heaven. Her children will grow up to be a blessing and\nan honor to her in this life and in the life to come.\u2014Gospel Workers,\n206 (1915).\nThe Important Work at Home \u2014If married men go into the\nwork, leaving their wives to care for the children at home, the wife\nEvangelist\u2019s Wife 609\nand mother is doing fully as great and important a work as is the\nhusband and father. While one is in the missionary field, the other is a\nhome missionary, whose cares and anxieties and burdens frequently\nfar exceed those of the husband and father. The mother\u2019s work is\na solemn and important one,\u2014to mold the minds and fashion the\ncharacters of her children, to train them for usefulness here, and to [677]\nfit them for the future immortal life.\nThe husband, in the open missionary field, may receive the honor\nof men, while the home toiler may receive no earthly credit for her\nlabor; but if she works for the best interests of her family, seeking to\nfashion their characters after the divine Model, the recording angel\nwrites her name as one of the greatest missionaries in the world.\nThe minister\u2019s wife may be a great help to her husband in seeking\nto lighten his burden, if she keeps her own soul in the love of God.\nShe can teach the Word to her children. She can manage her own\nhousehold with economy and discretion. United with her husband,\nshe can educate her children in habits of economy, teaching them to\nrestrict their wants.\u2014Gospel Workers, 203 (1915).\nComplaining Spirit a Dead Weight\u2014These sisters are closely\nconnected with the work of God if He has called their husbands\nto preach the present truth. These servants, if truly called of God,\nwill feel the importance of the truth. They are standing between the\nliving and the dead, and must watch for souls as they that must give\nan account. Solemn is their calling, and their companions can be a\ngreat blessing or a great curse to them. They can cheer them when\ndesponding, comfort them when cast down, and encourage them to\nlook up and trust fully in God when their faith fails. Or they can\ntake an opposite course, look upon the dark side, think they have a\nhard time, exercise no faith in God, talk their trials and unbelief to\ntheir companions, indulge a complaining, murmuring spirit, and be\na dead weight, and even a curse to them....\nAn unsanctified wife is the greatest curse that a minister can [678]\nhave. Those servants of God that have been and are still so unhappily\nsituated as to have this withering influence at home, should double\ntheir prayers and their watchfulness, take a firm, decided stand, and\nlet not this darkness press them down. They should cleave closer\nto God, be firm and decided, rule well their own house, and live\nso that they can have the approbation of God and the watchcare of\n610 Evangelism\nthe angels. But if they yield to the wishes of their unconsecrated\ncompanions, the frown of God is brought upon the dwelling. The\nark of God cannot abide in the house, because they countenance and\nuphold them in their wrongs.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 1:138,\n139 (1856).\nMaintaining a High Moral Standard\nAbandonment of Principle Marks the Times \u2014Everywhere\nare seen wrecks of humanity, broken-down family altars, ruined\nhomes. There is a strange abandonment of principle, the standard of\nmorality is lowered, and the earth is fast becoming a Sodom. The\npractices which brought the judgment of God upon the antediluvian\nworld, and which caused Sodom to be destroyed by fire, are fast\nincreasing. We are nearing the end, when the earth is to be purified\nby fire.\u2014Gospel Workers, 125, 126 (1915).\nMinisters Satan\u2019s Target\u2014Satan\u2019s special temptations are di-\nrected against the ministry. He knows that ministers are but human,\npossessing no grace or holiness of their own; that the treasures of\nthe gospel have been placed in earthen vessels, which divine power\nalone can make vessels unto honor. He knows that God has ordained\nministers to be a powerful means for the salvation of souls, and that [679]\nthey can be successful in their work only as they allow the eternal\nFather to rule their lives. Therefore he tries with all his ingenuity\nto lead them into sin, knowing that their office makes sin in them\nmore exceeding sinful; for in committing sin, they make themselves\nministers of evil.\u2014Gospel Workers, 124 (1915).\nBalanced Dignity and Sociability\u2014The subject of purity and\npropriety of deportment is one to which we must give heed. We\nmust guard against the sins of this degenerate age. Let not Christ\u2019s\nambassadors descend to trifling conversation, to familiarity with\nwomen, married or single. Let them keep their proper place with\nbecoming dignity; yet at the same time they may be sociable, kind,\nand courteous to all. They must stand aloof from everything that\nsavors of commonness and familiarity. This is forbidden ground,\nupon which it is unsafe to set the feet. Every word, every act, should\ntend to elevate, to refine, to ennoble. There is sin in thoughtlessness\nabout such matters.\u2014Gospel Workers, 125 (1915).\nRebuke Flattery of Women\u2014You will sometimes be flattered\nby men, but more frequently by women. Especially when you\n611\n612 Evangelism\npresent the truth in new fields, will you meet persons who will\nengage in this wicked flattery. As a servant of Christ, despise the\nflattery; shun it as you would a venomous serpent. Rebuke the\nwoman who will praise your smartness, holding your hand as long as\nshe can retain it in her own. Have little to say to persons of this class;\nfor they are the agents of Satan, and carry out his plans by laying\nbewitching snares to beguile you from the path of holiness. Every\nsensible Christian lady will act a modest part; she will understand\nthe devices of Satan, and will not be a co-laborer with him.\nNever earn the reputation of being a minister who is a particular[680]\nfavorite with the women. Shun the society of those who by their\narts would weaken in the least your purpose to do right, or bring a\nstain upon the purity of your conscience. Do not give them your\ntime or your confidence; for they will leave you feeling bereft of\nyour spiritual strength. Do nothing among strangers, on the cars,\nin the home, in the street, that would have the least appearance of\nevil.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 8, 1884.\nAvoid Every Approach to Evil\u2014When one who claims to be\nteaching the truth is inclined to be much in the company of young\nor even married women, when he familiarly lays his hand upon their\nperson, or is often found conversing with them in a familiar manner,\nbe afraid of him; the pure principles of truth are not wrought in his\nsoul. Such are not workers with Jesus; they are not in Christ, and\nChrist is not abiding in them. They need a thorough conversion\nbefore God can accept their labors. The truth of heavenly origin\nnever degrades the receiver, never leads him to the least approach to\nundue familiarity; on the contrary, it sanctifies the believer, refines\nhis taste, elevates and ennobles him, and brings him into a close\nconnection with Jesus. It leads him to regard the apostle Paul\u2019s\ninjunction to abstain from even the appearance of evil, lest his good\nshould be evil spoken of....\nMen who are doing God\u2019s work, and who have Christ abiding in\ntheir hearts, will not lower the standard of morality, but will ever seek\nto elevate it. They will not find pleasure in the flattery of women, or\nin being petted by them. Let both young and married men say, Hands\noff! I will not give the least occasion to have my good evil spoken\nof. My good name is capital of far more value to me than gold or[681]\nsilver. Let me preserve it untarnished. If men assail that name, it\nMaintaining a High Moral Standard 613\nshall not be because I have given them any occasion to do so, but\nfor the same reason that they spoke falsely of Christ\u2014because they\nhated the purity and holiness of his character; for it was a constant\nrebuke to them.\nI wish I could impress upon every worker in God\u2019s cause, the\ngreat need of continual, earnest prayer. They cannot be constantly\nupon their knees, but they can be uplifting their hearts to God. This\nis the way that Enoch walked with God.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nNovember 10, 1885.\nFence the Soul \u2014There will be women who will become\ntempters, and who will do their best to attract and win the attention\nof men to themselves. First, they will seek to win their sympathy,\nnext their affection, and then to induce them to break God\u2019s holy law.\nThose who have dishonored their minds and affections by placing\nthem where God\u2019s Word forbids, will not scruple to dishonor God\nby various species of idolatry. God will leave them to their vile\naffections. It is necessary to guard the thoughts; to fence the soul\nabout with the injunctions of God\u2019s Word; and to be very careful in\nevery thought, word, and action not to be betrayed into sin.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, May 17, 1887.\nGuarding the Safeguards\u2014Our great adversary has agents that\nare constantly hunting for an opportunity to destroy souls, as a lion\nhunts his prey.... One safeguard removed from conscience, the\nindulgence of one evil habit, a single neglect of the high claims of\nduty, may be the beginning of a course of deception that will pass\nyou into the ranks of those who are serving Satan, while you are\nall the time professing to love God and His cause. A moment of [682]\nthoughtlessness, a single misstep, may turn the whole current of\nyour lives in the wrong direction. And you may never know what\ncaused your ruin until the sentence is pronounced, \u201cDepart from Me,\nye that work iniquity.\u201d\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:397, 398\n(1885).\nConverted by Unconverted Ministers\u2014A man may hear and\nacknowledge the whole truth, and yet know nothing of personal\npiety and true experimental religion. He may explain the way of\nsalvation to others, and yet himself be a castaway. The truth is\nholy and powerful, and searches the intents and purposes of the\nheart. The importance and authority of the truth in the great plan of\n614 Evangelism\nsalvation originated in the divine Author, and are not rendered void or\nworthless because the instruments employed in their administration\nare unholy or unfaithful.\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked a man who had been and still was practicing\nwickedness, \u201care souls converted to the truth through my influ-\nence?\u201d I answered, \u201cChrist is constantly drawing souls to Himself,\nand flashing His own light in their path. The seeker after salvation\nis not permitted to read the character of him who teaches him. If\nhe himself is sincere, if he draws nigh to God, believing in Him,\nconfessing his sins, he will be accepted.\u2014Letter 12, 1890.\nThe Internship Period\nYoung Workers Moving Into Line\u2014There are conscientious\nyoung men who are preparing to move into line, to strengthen the\noutposts. If they walk humbly with God, He will talk with them, and\ninstruct them. To them I would say, Work where you are, doing what [683]\nyou can to pass along the truth which is so precious to you. Preserve\nsimplicity, and then, when there are vacancies to be filled, you will\nhear the words, Friend, come up higher. You may be reluctant to\nadvance, but move forward with trust in God, bringing into His\nwork a fresh, honest experience and a heart filled with the faith that\nworks by love and purifies the soul. As you thirst for the water of\nlife, ask Christ for it, and He will give you to drink of the water\nof life freely. He will be to you a well of water, springing up into\neverlasting life.\u2014Letter 9, 1899.\nMuch Depends on Beginning Right\u2014The usefulness of young\nmen who feel that they are called by God to preach, depends much\nupon the manner in which they enter upon their labors. Those who\nare chosen of God for the work of the ministry will give proof of\ntheir high calling, and by every possible means will seek to develop\ninto able workmen.\u2014The Acts of the Apostles, 353 (1911).\nBegin Work in Association With Older Ministers \u2014In gain-\ning a preparation for the ministry, young men should be associated\nwith older ministers. Those who have gained an experience in active\nservice are to take young, inexperienced workers with them into the\nharvest field, teaching them how to labor successfully for the conver-\nsion of souls. Kindly and affectionately these older workers are to\nhelp the younger ones to prepare for the work to which the Lord may\ncall them. And the young men in training should respect the counsel\nof their instructors, honoring their devotion, and remembering that\ntheir years of labor have given them wisdom....\nLet the older workers be educators, keeping themselves under\nthe discipline of God. Let the young men feel it a privilege to study\nunder older workers, and let them carry every burden that their youth [684]\n615\n616 Evangelism\nand experience will allow. Thus Elijah educated the youth of Israel\nin the schools of the prophets; and young men today are to have\na similar training. It is not possible to advise in every particular\nthe part that the youth should act; but they should be faithfully\ninstructed by the older workers, and taught to look ever to Him who\nis the author and finisher of our faith.\u2014Gospel Workers, 101, 102\n(1915).\nTo Work With, but Not Copy, Experienced Workers \u2014The\ninexperienced ones should not be sent out alone. They should stand\nright by the side of older and experienced ministers, where they\ncould educate them. But they should say to them, \u201cYou must not\ncopy my gestures, nor the tone of my voice, so that nobody will\nknow whether you are speaking or whether I am speaking. You\nare to stand in your own armor, with your own phase of character,\nsanctified by God. You are not to take my phase of character, nor my\ngestures, nor my tone of voice, nor my expressions, nor my words.\u201d\nI think this has been shown me twenty times in my lifetime, and\nI have tried to tell it to the brethren, but the evil is not remedied.\nWhen one of these men who have not an experience in the work\nstands by your side he is not to think in everything just as you think,\nand look at everything just as you look at it; that if you should give\nup the truth he would say, \u201cI might as well give it up.\u201d Let them stand\nto obtain a symmetry of character from the God of heaven; not that\nthey should have your ideas, and you have a molding influence on\nthem; but you should carry them right to the Bible as their pattern.\nThe importance of these things has been shown me so many times\nthat I feel a burden on this point.\u2014Manuscript 19b, 1890.\nNot to Repress or Discourage New Workers\u2014God never de-[685]\nsigned that one man\u2019s judgment and plans should be regarded as\nsupreme. He says, Ye are laborers together with God. Let no man\nundertake to repress or discourage. Let him not seek to put his ar-\nmor upon his brother, for he has not proved it.... And the ministers\nare never to copy any man\u2019s gestures, his habits, his attitude, his\nexpressions, the tones of his voice. They are to become no man\u2019s\nshadow, in thought, in sentiment, or in devising and executing the\ngreat whole. If God has made you a shepherd of the flock, He has\ngiven you qualification to do that work.\u2014Manuscript 104, 1898.\nInternship Period 617\nYoung Men Called to Front-Line Service\u2014Men of gray hairs\nshould walk circumspectly and should give the young men who are\nseeking to grow, every opportunity to come to the front. The older\nmen should not feel it any dishonor to them for younger men, who\nmust use their capabilities and who must fill their individual places\nand become men to be relied on, to come to the front. Those who\nare older should encourage the young to develop their talents.\nWe need men who will take hold of the work as if they meant it.\nThe younger men must be given opportunities to develop.\u2014Letter\n97, 1896.\nTo Be Given Recognition\u2014He condescended to bring His dis-\nciples before the large numbers to give them reputation that many\nwould recognize in their workings that they worked as Christ had.\nThe very deeds of mercy given by our Lord will open a door for His\ndisciples.\u2014Letter 252, 1906.\nYoung Workers in School of Discipline\u2014Let us treat with re-\nspect the younger members of the Lord\u2019s family. The young men\njust entering the ministry may make many mistakes, but the older\nministers are not free from errors, notwithstanding the years they [686]\nhave been laboring. The Lord will take these younger men in hand\nHimself, sometimes afflicting them and permitting them to suffer for\ntheir mistakes, but never forsaking them. He gives them opportunity\nto become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly\nKing.\u2014Manuscript 127, 1902.\nYoung Men Called to the Harvest Field\u2014The Lord calls upon\nyoung men to enter the harvest field and work diligently as harvest\nhands. He calls upon them to work for Him, not to labor with\nthe churches already established, but to connect with experienced\nlaborers in work in the great harvest field. Let young men of ability\ngo forth and trade on their talents. As they go, let them trust to the\nguidance of the Lord....\nThis is the work young men should be encouraged to do, not to\nspeak to an audience which does not need their immature labors,\nwhich is well aware of this fact, and feels no drawing of the Spirit.\nThe Lord has not given to young men the work among the churches.\nTheir first duty is to learn lessons in various lines from the great\nTeacher....\n618 Evangelism\nWhat did Christ say to His disciples? \u201cIf any man serve Me,\nlet him follow Me.\u201d This is the rule given in the Word of God. By\nstudying the life of Christ, let the workers find out how He lived and\nworked. Let them strive each day to live the life of Christ, seeking\nto know the way of the Lord.\u2014Manuscript 75, 1900.\nAfter Twelve Months\u2019 Trial\u2014To those whom He calls to the\nwork of the ministry, the Lord will give tact and skill and under-\nstanding. If after laboring for twelve months in evangelistic work, a\nman has no fruit to show for his efforts, if the people for whom he[687]\nhas labored are not benefited, if he has not lifted the standard in new\nplaces, and no souls are converted by his labors, that man should\nhumble his heart before God, and endeavor to know if he has not\nmistaken his calling. The wages paid by the conference should be\ngiven to those who show fruit for their labor. The work of the one\nwho recognizes God as his efficiency, who has a true conception of\nthe value of souls, whose heart is filled with the love of Christ, will\nbe fruitful.\u2014Manuscript 26, 1905.\nCalls to and Transfers of the Evangelistic Worker\nMoving On to Unwarned Areas \u2014Often the inhabitants of a\ncity where Christ labored wished Him to stay with them and continue\nto work among them. But He would tell them that He must go to\ncities that had not heard the truths that He had to present. After\nHe had given the truth to those in one place, He left them to build\nupon what He had given them, while He went to another place. His\nmethods of labor are to be followed today by those to whom He\nhas left His work. We are to go from place to place, carrying the\nmessage. As soon as the truth has been proclaimed in one place, we\nare to go to warn others.\u2014Manuscript 71, 1903.\nMove Only When the Cloud Is Lifted\u2014Do not become rest-\nless or faithless; keep the armor girded on for battle, strengthen your\nsouls in God, and you can do valiantly. In God is our strength and\nefficiency.... When the cloud is lifted, and God indicates your duty\nto open the work in some other field, you can move understandingly.\nBut do not now forsake the field where so much has been done and [688]\nwhere there is still more to be done.\u2014Letter 77, 1895.\nThe Voice of Duty\u2014The voice of duty is the voice of God,\u2014an\ninborn, heaven-sent guide.\u2014Counsels on Health, 562 (1896).\nMay Know God Leads\u2014We are not to place the responsibility\nof our duty upon others, and wait for them to tell us what to do. We\ncannot depend for counsel upon humanity. The Lord will teach us\nour duty just as willingly as He will teach somebody else. If we\ncome to Him in faith, He will speak His mysteries to us personally....\nThose who decide to do nothing in any line that will displease God,\nwill know, after presenting their case before Him, just what course to\npursue. And they will receive not only wisdom, but strength.\u2014The\nDesire of Ages, 668 (1898).\nWorkers With a Sense of Duty\u2014In every advance move that\nGod has led us to make, in every step gained by God\u2019s people, there\nhave been ready tools of Satan among us, to stand back and suggest\ndoubts and unbelief, and to throw obstacles in our way, to weaken\n619\n620 Evangelism\nour faith and courage. We have had to stand like warriors, ready\nto press and fight our way through the opposition raised. This has\nmade our work tenfold harder than it otherwise would have been.\nWe have had to stand as firm and unyielding as a rock....\nSome ... seem to be without an anchor. Such have greatly\ninjured the cause of truth. There are others who seem never to have\na position where they can stand firmly and surely, ready to battle\nif need be when God calls for faithful soldiers to be found at the\npost of duty.... Some have no idea of running any risk or venturing\nanything themselves. But somebody must venture; someone must\nrun risks in this cause.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 3:315, 316\n(1873).\nEvangelists to Complete Their Effort\u2014I know nothing in re-[689]\ngard to Elder -----\u2019s case, except that he has been used by the Lord in\nHis work in Los Angeles, and that he has been greatly blessed. Over\none hundred have taken their stand for the truth as a result of his\nlabors. At the close of his last series of tent meetings he thought of\nchanging his field of labor, but he received a petition signed by many\nof the citizens of Los Angeles, asking him to remain and continue his\nmeetings. The Lord has given Brother ----- a spirit of adaptability,\nwith wisdom to plan and carry out his work, and He has blessed him\nin the bringing out of leaflets, notices, and charts that have aroused\nthe interest of the people.\nI would say, Let Brother ----- labor where his message is ev-\nidently accomplishing great good. Those who have come to his\nmeetings have given freely of their means to sustain the work that\nhe has carried forward....\nFor the present let him remain in Los Angeles; for the Lord is\ngiving him marked success in bearing the message to the people.\nLet him give the trumpet a certain sound, arousing those who have\nnever heard the truth. May the Lord encourage him to remain in Los\nAngeles until the church members are aroused to gird on the armor\nand show that they have a burden to give the message....\nLet no one, by precept or example, seek to draw Elder ----- from\nhis God-appointed work. Let all take hold with him in an effort to\ncarry the work in clear lines.\u2014Letter 75, 1905.\nGuiding Principles in Calling an Evangelist\u2014As to whether\nit is right for Elder ----- to leave Los Angeles and labor for a time in\nCalls to and Transfers of the Evangelistic Worker 621\na Northern city, I will say, We must sometimes leave such questions\nvery largely to the man himself. There is too much displacing of the [690]\nmen who are doing a good work, the very work that the Lord has\nsaid should be done. Sometimes when a man is having success in\nhis efforts and the interest continues good, the question of moving\nhim to another field ought not to come to him at all, because it only\nconfuses him. If the Lord is mightily stirring the people of Los\nAngeles, through the tent meetings, let nothing interrupt the work....\nLet no one try to draw Brother ----- away from the place where there\nis a deep interest and an extraordinary opening to present the truth.\nThis is Los Angeles\u2019 opportunity.\u2014Letter 193, 1905.\nWorkers Harmed by Unnecessary Moving \u2014I think it does\nharm to call workers from one part of the vineyard where they are\ndoing good work, to go to another field where they are to begin all\nnew. I think it gives the ones called an idea that they are of greater\nconsequence than they really are, and the poor souls will be injured.\nI caution you on this point of changing workers when there is no\nnecessity.\u2014Letter 179, 1900.\nEarly Move of Workers Not Understood by Converts \u2014I\nknew that Brother and Sister ----- were not free from faults, but\nthat they were striving to know and to do the Master\u2019s will, and\nthat they had talents that fitted them to reach men and women in\nthe higher walks of life, and that through their labors many might\nbecome interested in the truth. I knew that a move would deprive an\nimportant field of labor that was much needed, and also that a move\nwould mean much to them personally, for they had just gotten fairly\nsettled in a suitable home. I did not feel free to lend my influence to\nhave them moved.\nTheir removal to another field under such circumstances would [691]\ncause an unfavorable impression to be left on the minds of those\nwho, through their efforts, had newly accepted the faith. Moreover,\nif it were indeed true that they possessed objectionable traits of char-\nacter, the case would not be made better by sending them to another\nfield of labor, for they would carry with them their objectionable\ncharacteristics and methods.\u2014Letter 48, 1907.\nMoving Men Too Soon\u2014Satan\u2019s Device \u2014Had the minister\nutterly refused to listen to the colored, one-sided statements of any,\nhad he given words of advice in accordance with the Bible rule and\n622 Evangelism\nsaid, like Nehemiah, \u201cI am doing a great work, so that I cannot\ncome down,\u201d that church would have been in a far better condition.\nThis work of withdrawing men from their fields of labor has been\nrepeated again and again in the progress of this cause. It is the device\nof the great adversary of souls to hinder the work of God. When\nsouls that are upon the point of deciding in favor of the truth are thus\nleft to unfavorable influences, they lose their interest, and it is very\nrarely that so powerful an impression can again be made upon them.\nSatan is ever seeking some device to call the minister from his field\nof labor at this critical point, that the results of his labors may be\nlost.\u2014Manuscript 1, 1878.\nSection 20\u2014The Message Triumphant [692]\nWhen the Loud Cry Sounds\nTruth Soon to Triumph \u2014The end is near, stealing upon us\nstealthily, imperceptibly, like the noiseless approach of a thief in the\nnight. May the Lord grant that we shall no longer sleep as do others,\nbut that we shall watch and be sober. The truth is soon to triumph\ngloriously, and all who now choose to be laborers together with God,\nwill triumph with it. The time is short; the night soon cometh when\nno man can work.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:135 (1909).\nConversion as at Pentecost\u2014The time is coming when there\nwill be as many converted in a day as there were on the day of\nPentecost, after the disciples had received the Holy Spirit.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, June 29, 1905.\nThousands Yet to Step Into Light\u2014Many have let the gospel\ninvitation go unheeded; they have been tested and tried; but moun-\ntainous obstacles have seemed to loom up before their faces, block-\ning their onward march. Through faith, perseverance, and courage,\nmany will surmount these obstructions and walk out into the glorious\nlight.\nAlmost unconsciously barriers have been erected in the strait and\nnarrow way; stones of stumbling have been placed in the path; these\nwill all be rolled away. The safeguards which false shepherds have\nthrown around their flocks will become as nought; thousands will[693]\nstep out into the light, and work to spread the light. Heavenly intel-\nligences will combine with the human agencies. Thus encouraged,\nthe church will indeed arise and shine, throwing all her sanctified\nenergies into the contest; thus the design of God is accomplished;\nthe lost pearls are recovered.\nProphets have discerned this grand work afar off, and have caught\nthe inspiration of the hour, and traced the wonderful description of\nthings yet to be.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 23, 1895.\nMany Backsliders Will Return\u2014When the storm of persecu-\ntion really breaks upon us, the true sheep will hear the true Shep-\nherd\u2019s voice. Self-denying efforts will be put forth to save the lost,\n624\nWhen the Loud Cry Sounds 625\nand many who have strayed from the fold will come back to follow\nthe great Shepherd. The people of God will draw together, and\npresent to the enemy a united front.... The love of Christ, the love of\nour brethren, will testify to the world that we have been with Jesus\nand learned of Him. Then will the message of the third angel swell\nto a loud cry, and the whole earth will be lightened with the glory of\nthe Lord.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 6:401 (1900).\nInfluenced by the Press\u2014God will soon do great things for us,\nif we lie humble and believing at His feet....More than one thousand\nwill soon be converted in one day, most of whom will trace their\nfirst convictions to the reading of our publications.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, November 10, 1885.\nThe Power of 1844 Repeated \u2014The power which stirred the\npeople so mightily in the 1844 movement will again be revealed.\nThe third angel\u2019s message will go forth, not in whispered tones, but\nwith a loud voice.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 5:252 (1885).\nThe Loud Cry \u2014During the loud cry, the church, aided by [694]\nthe providential interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the\nknowledge of salvation so abundantly that light will be commu-\nnicated to every city and town. The earth will be filled with the\nknowledge of salvation. So abundantly will the renewing Spirit of\nGod have crowned with success the intensely active agencies, that\nthe light of present truth will be seen flashing everywhere.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, October 13, 1904.\nThe Reason for the Delay\nDeferred in Mercy\u2014The long night of gloom is trying, but the\nmorning is deferred in mercy, because if the Master should come,\nso many would be found unready. God\u2019s unwillingness to have His\npeople perish, has been the reason of so long delay.\u2014Testimonies\nFor The Church 2:194 (1868).\nThe Work Might Have Been Done\u2014Had the purpose of God\nbeen carried out by His people in giving to the world the message\nof mercy, Christ would, ere this, have come to the earth, and the\nsaints would have received their welcome into the city of God.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 6:450 (1900).\nI know that if the people of God had preserved a living connec-\ntion with Him, if they had obeyed His Word, they would today be\nin the heavenly Canaan.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, March\n30, 1903.\nSatan Has Stolen a March on Us\u2014If every watchman on the\nwalls of Zion had given the trumpet a certain sound, the world\nmight ere this have heard the message of warning. But the work is\nyears behind. While men have slept, Satan has stolen a march upon\nus.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:29 (1909).\nNo Failure of God\u2019s Promises \u2014The angels of God in their[695]\nmessages to men represent time as very short. Thus it has always\nbeen presented to me. It is true that time has continued longer than\nwe expected in the early days of this message. Our Saviour did\nnot appear as soon as we hoped. But has the Word of the Lord\nfailed? Never! It should be remembered that the promises and the\nthreatenings of God are alike conditional.\nGod had committed to His people a work to be accomplished\non earth. The third angel\u2019s message was to be given, the minds of\nbelievers were to be directed to the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ\nhad entered to make atonement for His people. The Sabbath reform\nwas to be carried forward. The breach in the law of God must be\nmade up. The message must be proclaimed with a loud voice, that\n626\nReason for the Delay 627\nall the inhabitants of earth might receive the warning. The people of\nGod must purify their souls through obedience to the truth, and be\nprepared to stand without fault before Him at His coming.\nHad Adventists, after the great disappointment in 1844, held fast\ntheir faith and followed on unitedly in the opening providence of\nGod, receiving the message of the third angel and in the power of\nthe Holy Spirit proclaiming it to the world, they would have seen\nthe salvation of God, the Lord would have wrought mightily with\ntheir efforts, the work would have been completed, and Christ would\nhave come ere this to receive His people to their reward. But in the\nperiod of doubt and uncertainty that followed the disappointment,\nmany of the advent believers yielded their faith.... Thus the work\nwas hindered, and the world was left in darkness. Had the whole\nAdventist body united upon the commandments of God and the faith [696]\nof Jesus, how widely different would have been our history!\nIt was not the will of God that the coming of Christ should be thus\ndelayed. God did not design that His people, Israel, should wander\nforty years in the wilderness. He promised to lead them directly\nto the land of Canaan, and establish them there a holy, healthy,\nhappy people. But those to whom it was first preached, went not\nin \u201cbecause of unbelief.\u201d Their hearts were filled with murmuring,\nrebellion, and hatred, and He could not fulfill His covenant with\nthem.\nFor forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out\nancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have delayed\nthe entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In nei-\nther case were the promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the\nworldliness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord\u2019s professed\npeople that have kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many\nyears.\u2014Manuscript 4, 1883.\nCharge It Not to God \u2014We may have to remain here in this\nworld because of insubordination many more years, as did the chil-\ndren of Israel; but for Christ\u2019s sake, His people should not add sin\nto sin by charging God with the consequence of their own wrong\ncourse of action.\u2014Letter 184, 1901.\nWe May Hasten the Day\u2014By giving the gospel to the world it\nis in our power to hasten our Lord\u2019s return.\u2014The Desire of Ages,\n633 (1898).\n628 Evangelism\nIt is the privilege of every Christian, not only to look for, but to\nhasten the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Were all who profess\nHis name bearing fruit to His glory, how quickly the whole world\nwould be sown with the seed of the gospel. Quickly the last harvest\nwould be ripened, and Christ would come to gather the precious[697]\ngrain.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 8:22, 23 (1904).\nWhen the Message Is Finished \u2014It [the coming of the Lord]\nwill not tarry past the time that the message is borne to all nations,\ntongues, and peoples. Shall we who claim to be students of prophecy\nforget that God\u2019s forbearance to the wicked is a part of the vast and\nmerciful plan by which He is seeking to compass the salvation of\nsouls?\u2014The Review and Herald, June 18, 1901.\nPower for Finishing the Work\nWhy Many Have Failed in Soul Winning\u2014Many present the\ndoctrines and theories of our faith; but their presentation is as salt\nwithout savor; for the Holy Spirit is not working through their faith-\nless ministry. They have not opened the heart to receive the grace of\nChrist; they know not the operation of the Spirit; they are as meal\nwithout leaven; for there is no working principle in all their labor,\nand they fail to win souls to Christ. They do not appropriate the\nrighteousness of Christ; it is a robe unworn by them, a fullness un-\nknown, a fountain untouched.\u2014The Review and Herald, November\n29, 1892.\nNeed of Intensity to Impress Unbelievers \u2014We need greater\nearnestness in the cause of Christ. The solemn message of truth\nshould be given with an intensity that would impress unbelievers\nthat God is working with our efforts, that the Most High is our living\nsource of strength.\u2014The Signs of the Times, December 9, 1886.\nWhen we bring our hearts into unity with Christ, and our lives\ninto harmony with His work, the Spirit that fell on the disciples on [698]\nthe day of Pentecost will fall on us.\u2014The Review and Herald, June\n30, 1903.\nWith the Zeal of the Apostles \u2014Zeal for the glory of God\nmoved the disciples to bear witness to the truth with mighty power.\nShould not this zeal fire our hearts with a longing to tell the story of\nredeeming love, of Christ and Him crucified? Should not the power\nof God be even more mightily revealed today then in the time of the\napostles?\u2014The Signs of the Times, February 17, 1914.\nThe Source of Their Power\u2014After Christ\u2019s ascension, the dis-\nciples were gathered together in one place to make humble supplica-\ntion to God. And after ten days of heart searching and self-examina-\ntion, the way was prepared for the Holy Spirit to enter the cleansed,\nconsecrated soul temples. Every heart was filled with the Spirit, as\nthough God desired to show His people that it was His prerogative to\nbless them with the choicest of heaven\u2019s blessings.... The sword of\n629\n630 Evangelism\nthe Spirit flashed right and left. Newly edged with power, it pierced\neven to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and\nmarrow. The idolatry that had been mingled with the worship of the\npeople was overthrown. New territory was added to the kingdom of\nGod. Places that had been barren and desolate sounded forth His\npraises.\u2014The Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.\nThey Felt the Burden of Souls \u2014Notice that it was after the\ndisciples had come into perfect unity, when they were no longer\nstriving for the highest place, that the Spirit was poured out. They\nwere of one accord. All differences had been put away. And the\ntestimony borne of them after the Spirit had been given is the same.\nMark the word: \u201cThe multitude of them that believed were of one\nheart and of one soul.\u201d The Spirit of Him who died that sinners might[699]\nlive, animated the entire congregation of believers.\nThe disciples did not ask for a blessing for themselves. They\nwere weighted with the burden of souls. The gospel was to be\ncarried to the ends of the earth, and they claimed the endowment\nof power that Christ had promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit\nwas poured out, and thousands were converted in a day.\u2014The Signs\nof the Times, February 17, 1914.\nAn Awakened Church\u2014When we have entire, wholehearted\nconsecration to the service of Christ, God will recognize the fact\nby an outpouring of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be\nwhile the largest portion of the church are not laborers together with\nGod.\u2014The Review and Herald, July 21, 1896.\nEarth Enlightened\u2014I saw jets of light shining from cities and\nvillages, and from the high places and the low places of the earth.\nGod\u2019s Word was obeyed, and as a result there were memorials for\nHim in every city and village. His truth was proclaimed throughout\nthe world.\u2014Testimonies For The Church 9:28, 29 (1909).\nHundreds and thousands were seen visiting families, and opening\nbefore them the Word of God. Hearts were convicted by the power of\nthe Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine conversion was manifest. On\nevery side doors were thrown open to the proclamation of the truth.\nThe world seemed to be lightened with the heavenly influence.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 9:126 (1909).\nThrough Humble Instruments\u2014As the time comes for it [the\nmessage of the third angel] to be given with greatest power, the\nPower for Finishing the Work 631\nLord will work through humble instruments, leading the minds of\nthose who consecrate themselves to His service. The laborers will\nbe qualified rather by the unction of His Spirit than by the training [700]\nof literary institutions. Men of faith and prayer will be constrained\nto go forth with holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives\nthem. The sins of Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results\nof enforcing the observances of the church by civil authority, the\ninroads of Spiritualism, the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal\npower,\u2014all will be unmasked. By these solemn warnings the people\nwill be stirred. Thousands upon thousands will listen who have\nnever heard words like these.\u2014The Great Controversy, 606 (1888).\nMultitudes Will Join the Armies of the Lord\u2014Many ... will\nbe seen hurrying hither and thither, constrained by the Spirit of God\nto bring the light to others. The truth, the Word of God, is as a fire in\ntheir bones, filling them with a burning desire to enlighten those who\nsit in darkness. Many, even among the uneducated, now proclaim\nthe words of the Lord. Children are impelled by the Spirit to go\nforth and declare the message from heaven. The Spirit is poured\nout upon all who will yield to its promptings, and, casting off all\nman\u2019s machinery, his binding rules and cautious methods, they will\ndeclare the truth with the might of the Spirit\u2019s power. Multitudes\nwill receive the faith and join the armies of the Lord.\u2014The Review\nand Herald, July 23, 1895.\nThousands of Voices Sound Warning\u2014Servants of God, with\ntheir faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration, will hasten\nfrom place to place to proclaim the message from heaven. By\nthousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be given.\nMiracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and\nwonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying\nwonders, even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men. [701]\nThus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take their stand.\nThe message will be carried not so much by argument as by\nthe deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments have been\npresented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring up and\nbear fruit. The publications distributed by missionary workers have\nexerted their influence, yet many whose minds were impressed have\nbeen prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from yielding\nobedience. Now the rays of light penetrate everywhere, the truth\n632 Evangelism\nis seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever the\nbands which have held them. Family connections, church relations,\nare powerless to stay them now. Truth is more precious than all\nbesides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth,\na large number take their stand upon the Lord\u2019s side.\u2014The Great\nControversy, 612 (1888).\nThe descent of the Holy Spirit upon the church is looked forward\nto as in the future; but it is the privilege of the church to have it now.\nSeek for it, pray for it, believe for it. We must have it, and Heaven is\nwaiting to bestow it.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 19, 1895.\nThe Latter Rain\u2014Let Christians ... ask in faith for the promised\nblessing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days\nof the apostles was the former rain, and glorious was the result.\nBut the latter rain will be more abundant.\u2014The Signs of the Times,\nFebruary 17, 1914.\nPresent Hour of Opportunity\nThe Work for Today\u2014The third angel\u2019s message is swelling\ninto a loud cry, and you must not feel at liberty to neglect the present [702]\nduty, and still entertain the idea that at some future time you will\nbe the recipients of great blessing, when without any effort on your\npart a wonderful revival will take place.... Today you are to have\nyour vessel purified, that it may be ready for the heavenly dew, ready\nfor the showers of the latter rain; for the latter rain will come, and\nthe blessing of God will fill every soul that is purified from every\ndefilement. It is our work today to yield our souls to Christ, that\nwe may be fitted for the time of refreshing from the presence of the\nLord\u2014fitted for the baptism of the Holy Spirit....\nInstead of living in expectation of some special season of excite-\nment, we are wisely to improve present opportunities, doing that\nwhich must be done in order that souls may be saved. Instead of\nexhausting the powers of our mind in speculations in regard to the\ntimes and seasons which the Lord has placed in His own power,\nand withheld from men, we are to yield ourselves to the control\nof the Holy Spirit, to do present duties, to give the bread of life,\nunadulterated with human opinions, to souls who are perishing for\nthe truth.\u2014The Review and Herald, March 22, 1892.\nUnprecedented Opportunities\u2014In these days of travel, the\nopportunities for coming in contact with men and women of all\nclasses and of many nationalities, are much greater than in the days\nof Israel. The thoroughfares of travel have multiplied a thousandfold.\nGod has wonderfully prepared the way. The agency of the printing\npress, with its manifold facilities, is at our command. Bibles and\npublications in many languages, setting forth the truth for this time,\nare at our hand, and can be swiftly carried to every part of the world.\nWe are to give the last warning of God to men, and what should [703]\nbe our earnestness in studying the Bible, and our zeal in spreading\nthe light!\u2014The Review and Herald, January 25, 1906.\n633\n634 Evangelism\nGod Provides These Opportunities\u2014A crisis is right upon us.\nWe must now by the Holy Spirit\u2019s power proclaim the great truths for\nthese last days. It will not be long before everyone will have heard\nthe warning and made his decision. Then shall the end come.... God\nis the great Master Worker, and by His providence He prepares the\nway for His work to be accomplished. He provides opportunities,\nopens up lines of influence, and channels of working. If His people\nare watching the indications of His providence, and stand ready to\nco-operate with Him, they will see a great work accomplished.\u2014\nTestimonies For The Church 6:24 (1900).\nNational Crisis Brings Religious Awakening \u2014Today men\nand nations are being tested by the plummet in the hand of Him\nwho makes no mistake....\nToday the signs of the times declare that we are standing on the\nthreshold of great and solemn events. Everything in our world is\nin agitation. Before our eyes is fulfilling the Saviour\u2019s prophecy\nof the events to precede His coming: \u201cYe shall hear of wars and\nrumors of wars.... Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom\nagainst kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and\nearthquakes, in divers places.\u201d\nThe present is a time of overwhelming interest to all living.\nRulers and statesmen, men who occupy positions of trust and au-\nthority, thinking men and women of all classes, have their attention\nfixed upon the events taking place about us. They are watching the\nrelations that exist among the nations. They observe the intensity[704]\nthat is taking possession of every earthly element, and they recognize\nthat something great and decisive is about to take place,\u2014that the\nworld is on the verge of a stupendous crisis.\u2014Prophets and Kings,\n536, 537 (1916).\nOur Duty in the Moment of Respite\u2014Angels are now restrain-\ning the winds of strife, until the world shall be warned of its coming\ndoom; but a storm is gathering, ready to burst upon the earth, and\nwhen God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there will be such a\nscene of strife as no pen can picture....\nA moment of respite has been graciously given us of God. Every\npower lent us of heaven is to be used in doing the work assigned us\nby the Lord for those who are perishing in ignorance....\nPresent Hour of Opportunity 635\nGod\u2019s people should make mighty intercession to Him for help\nnow. And they must put their whole energies into the effort to\nproclaim the truth during the respite that has been granted....\nEvery day we have been associating with men and women who\nare judgment bound. Each day may have been the dividing line\nfor some soul. Each day someone may have made the decision\nwhich will determine his future destiny.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nNovember 23, 1905.\nSignificance of the Conflict \u2014We do not understand as we\nshould the great conflict going on between invisible agencies, the\ncontroversy between loyal and disloyal angels. Over every man,\ngood and evil angels strive. This is no make-believe conflict. It is\nno mimic battle in which we are engaged. We have to meet most\npowerful adversaries, and it rests with us to determine which shall\nwin. We are to find our strength where the early disciples found\ntheirs.\u2014The Signs of the Times, February 17, 1914.\nHeathenism Revived; Man of Sin Exposed\u2014As we near the [705]\nclose of time, there will be greater and still greater external parade\nof heathen power; heathen deities will manifest their signal power,\nand will exhibit themselves before the cities of the world; and this\ndelineation has already begun to be fulfilled. By a variety of im-\nages the Lord Jesus represented to John the wicked character and\nseductive influence of those who have been distinguished for their\npersecution of God\u2019s people. All need wisdom carefully to search\nout the mystery of iniquity that figures so largely in the winding up\nof this earth\u2019s history....\nIn the very time in which we live, the Lord has called His people\nand has given them a message to bear. He has called them to expose\nthe wickedness of the man of sin who has made the Sunday law a\ndistinctive power, who has thought to change times and laws, and\nto oppress the people of God who stand firmly to honor Him by\nkeeping the only true Sabbath, the Sabbath creation, as holy unto\nthe Lord.\u2014Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 117, 118.\nGod\u2019s Fearless Messengers\u2014At the present time, when the end\nof all things earthly is rapidly approaching, Satan is putting forth\ndesperate efforts to ensnare the world. He is devising many plans\nto occupy minds, and to divert attention from the truths essential to\nsalvation....\n636 Evangelism\nWickedness is reaching a height never before attained, and yet\nmany ministers of the gospel are crying, \u201cPeace and safety.\u201d But\nGod\u2019s faithful messengers are to go steadily forward with their work.\nClothed with the panoply of heaven, they are to advance fearlessly\nand victoriously, never ceasing their warfare until every soul within\ntheir reach shall have received the message of truth for this time.\u2014[706]\nThe Acts of the Apostles, 219, 220 (1911).\nSpeedy Triumphant Climax\nThe Gospel Once Shook the World\u2014By the co-operation of\nthe divine Spirit, the apostles did a work that shook the world. To\nevery nation was the gospel carried in a single generation.\nGlorious were the results that attended the ministry of the chosen\napostles of Christ....\nNot in their own power did the apostles accomplish their mission,\nbut in the power of the living God. Their work was not easy. The\nopening labors of the Christian church were attended by hardship\nand bitter grief. In their work the disciples constantly encountered\nprivation, calumny, and persecution; but they counted not their lives\ndear unto themselves and rejoiced that they were called to suffer\nfor Christ. Irresolution, indecision, weakness of purpose, found no\nplace in their efforts. They were willing to spend and be spent. The\nconsciousness of the responsibility resting on them purified and en-\nriched their experience; and the grace of heaven was revealed in the\nconquests they achieved for Christ. With the might of omnipotence\nGod worked through them to make the gospel triumphant.\u2014The\nActs of the Apostles, 593-595 (1911).\nA Firmament of Chosen Ones \u2014Among earth\u2019s inhabitants,\nscattered in every land, there are those who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which appear only at night,\nthese faithful ones will shine forth when darkness covers the earth\nand gross darkness the people. In heathen Africa, in the Catholic\nlands of Europe and of South America, in China, in India, in the [707]\nislands of the sea, and in all the dark corners of the earth, God has in\nreserve a firmament of chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst\nthe darkness, revealing clearly to an apostate world the transforming\npower of obedience to His law. Even now they are appearing in\nevery nation, among every tongue and people; and in the hour of\ndeepest apostasy, when Satan\u2019s supreme effort is made to cause \u201call,\nboth small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to receive, under\npenalty of death, the sign of allegiance to a false rest day, these\n637\n638 Evangelism\nfaithful ones, \u201cblameless and harmless, the sons of God, without\nrebuke,\u201d will \u201cshine as lights in the world.\u201d The darker the night,\nthe more brilliantly will they shine.\u2014Prophets and Kings, 188, 189\n(1916).\nThe Church Triumphant\u2014The work is soon to close. The\nmembers of the church militant who have proved faithful will be-\ncome the church triumphant.\u2014Letter 32, 1892.\nAnd still our General, who never makes a mistake, says to us,\n\u201cAdvance; enter new territory; lift the standard in every land. \u2018Arise,\nshine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon\nthee.\u2019\u201d\nThe time has come when through God\u2019s messengers the scroll is\nbeing unrolled to the world. The truth contained in the first, second,\nand third angels\u2019 messages must go to every nation, kindred, tongue,\nand people; it must lighten the darkness of every continent, and\nextend to the islands of the sea. There must be no delay in this work.\nOur watchword is to be, Onward, ever onward! Angels of heaven\nwill go before us to prepare the way. Our burden for the regions\nbeyond can never be laid down till the whole earth is lightened with\nthe glory of the Lord.\u2014Gospel Workers, 470 (1915).",
