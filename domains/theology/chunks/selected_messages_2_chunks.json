documents, pamphlets, and Ellen G. White\u2019s\nletters and manuscripts. A statement about the compilation and\npurpose of Selected Messages is given in \u201cA Word to the Reader\u201d in\nBook 1, hence is not repeated here.\nThe counsels contained in this volume provide warnings against\nfanatical and deceptive teachings, give principles for detecting false\nprophets and misleading movements, and deal with such practical\nissues as avoiding labor conflicts and providing fair pay for church\nworkers. They offer guidance for the aging, courage for the suffering,\nassurance for the dying, and comfort for the bereaved. Also included\nare counsels about miraculous healing, proper attitudes in prayer,\nvoting, saving money for future needs, serving in the military, and\nmany other practical topics.\nCounsels related to health form a significant part of this vol-\nume. Section VII deals with the use of medications and medical\nprocedures, and Appendix 1 contains Mrs. White\u2019s six articles on\n\u201cDisease and Its Causes\u201d from her 1865 publication of Health, or\nHow to Live . These articles present some of her earliest health\ncounsel.\nEach section of this book is preceded by an introduction. Pre-\npared by the White Estate Trustees, these introductions provide\nbackground and context for the material that follows. In providing\nthis historical information, they also give the reader a better under-\nstanding of how to apply the counsels in the section. Particularly\nnoteworthy are the introductions to Section VII and Appendix 1.\nAppendix items 2 and 3 have special value at this time as the\nAdvent message circles the globe and reaches all cultures: \u201cImpor-\ntant Factors in Choosing a Life Companion\u201d and \u201cThe Brotherhood\nof Mankind.\u201d\nxi\nxii Selected Messages Book 2\nThe present volume closes with the section entitled \u201cAs We\nNear the End.\u201d Included are a number of specific messages that\ninstill confidence in the triumph of the church. Among them are\ntwo messages Mrs. White addressed to the General Conference\nsession in 1913, the last session before her death in 1915. Because\nof her advanced age, she was unable to attend the session, but her\nwords were read to the delegates. These communications express\nconfidence in her fellow workers and in the triumph of the cause to\nwhich she devoted her life.\nThat this volume of Selected Messages may cheer and guide the\nAdvent family on their journey to the city of God is the sincere wish\nof the Publishers and\nThe Board of Trustees of the Ellen G. White Estate\nSection 1\u2014Fanaticism and Deceptive [12]\nTeachings\nIntroduction\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church is brought to view in\nprophecy in the setting of conflict, for Satan, the dragon, wages\nrelentless war against those who \u201ckeep the commandments of God,\nand have the testimony of Jesus.\u201d The great adversary knows that if\nhe is successful in misleading and confusing Seventh-day Adven-\ntists, he frustrates the purposes of God. His attacks are usually of\nan insidious character, and often of a nature tending to lead sincere\nmen and women to such extremes that they will believe a lie.\nWhile remarkably free from fanaticism and extremes, the Advent\nMovement since its early days has faced the threat of fanaticism. One\nof Mrs. White\u2019s first tasks was to go into the field to meet fanaticism\nwith the Word of God. Down through the seventy years of her\nministry she was called upon again and again to meet fanatical or\ndeceptive teachings in one form or another. The many warnings that\nfanaticism is to be repeated, serve to alert the church to its dangers;\nand the counsels the messenger of the Lord has given concerning\nvarious types of fanatical outbreak and emotional religion are of\ngreat service now in safeguarding the flock.\nThe instruction included in this section, supplementing like warn-\nings appearing in earlier E. G. White books, for the most part were\ndrawn together in 1933 in a compilation to meet a critical situation\nthat developed in one local conference. Available in mimeographed\nform, this material has been much appreciated and has served the\nchurch well. The Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications\nwelcome this opportunity to present these important counsels in\npermanent form.\nThe section closes with various statements dealing with the\nmanifestation of spurious miracle-working power and the relative\nimportance of miracles to the presentation of testing truths. These\ncounsels are of particular value now, and will be more essential as\nwe near the earth\u2019s closing days, when Satan, through one scheme\nand device after another, will attempt to deceive the very elect.\n14\nIntroduction 15\nWhite Trustees.\nChapter 1\u2014Warnings Against Sensational[13]\nTeachings and Emotional Religion\nThe Danger of Speculative Ideas\nThere is a time of trouble coming to the people of God, but we\nare not to keep that constantly before the people, and rein them up to\nhave a time of trouble beforehand. There is to be a shaking among\nGod\u2019s people; but this is not the present truth to carry to the churches.\nIt will be the result of refusing the truth presented.\nThe ministers should not feel that they have some wonderful\nadvanced ideas, and unless all receive these, they will be shaken\nout, and a people will arise to go forward and upward to the victory.\nSatan\u2019s object is accomplished just as surely when men run ahead\nof Christ and do the work He has never entrusted to their hands, as\nwhen they remain in the Laodicean state, lukewarm, feeling rich and\nincreased with goods, and in need of nothing. The two classes are\nequally stumbling blocks.\nSome zealous ones who are aiming and straining every energy\nfor originality have made a grave mistake in trying to get something\nstartling, wonderful, entrancing, before the people, something that\nthey think others do not comprehend; but often they do not them-\nselves know what they are talking about. They speculate upon God\u2019s\nWord, advancing ideas that are not a whit of help to themselves or to[14]\nthe churches. For the time being, they may excite the imagination;\nbut there is a reaction, and these very ideas become a hindrance.\nFaith is confounded with fancy, and their views may bias the mind\nin the wrong direction. Let the plain, simple statements of the Word\nof God be food for the mind; this speculating upon ideas that are\nnot clearly presented there, is dangerous business.\u2014Manuscript 82,\n1894.\nThe danger that threatens our churches is that new and strange\nthings will be brought in, things that confuse the minds of the people,\nand give them no strength, at the very time when they most need\n16\nWarnings Against Sensational Teachings and Emotional Religion 17\nstrength in spiritual things. Clear discernment is needed that things\nnew and strange shall not be laid alongside of truth as a part of the\nburden of the message to be given at this time. The very messages\nwe have been giving to the world are to be made prominent.\u2014An\nAppeal for Canvassers, pp. 1, 2.\nThe Charm of New Theories\nEvery phase of fanaticism and erroneous theories, claiming to\nbe the truth, will be brought in among the remnant people of God.\nThese will fill minds with erroneous sentiments which have no part\nin the truth for this time. Any man who supposes that in the strength\nof his own devised resolutions, in his intellectual might united with\nscience or supposed knowledge, he can start a work which will\nconquer the world, will find himself lying among the ruins of his\nown speculations, and will plainly understand why he is there....\nFrom the light given me of the Lord, men will arise speaking\nperverse things. Yea, already they have been working and speaking\nthings which God has never revealed, bringing sacred truth upon a\nlevel with common things. Issues have been and will continue to\nbe made of men\u2019s conceited fallacies, not of truth. The devisings of\nmen\u2019s minds will invent tests that are no tests at all, that when the\ntrue test shall be made prominent, it shall be considered on a par with\nthe man-made tests that have been of no value. We may expect that [15]\neverything will be brought in and mingled with sound doctrine, but\nby clear, spiritual discernment, by the heavenly anointing, we must\ndistinguish the sacred from the common which is being brought in\nto confuse faith and sound judgment, and demerit the great, grand,\ntesting truth for this time....\nNever, never was there a time when the truth suffered more from\nbeing misrepresented, belittled, demerited through the perverse dis-\nputings of men than in these last days. Men have brought themselves\nin with their heterogeneous mass of heresies which they represent as\noracles for the people. The people are charmed with some strange\nnew thing, and are not wise in experience to discern the character\nof ideas that men may frame up as something. But to call it some-\nthing of great consequence and tie it to the oracles of God, does not\n18 Selected Messages Book 2\nmake it truth. Oh, how this rebukes the low standard of piety in the\nchurches.\nMen who want to present something original will conjure up\nthings new and strange, and without consideration will step forward\non these unstable theories, that have been woven together as a pre-\ncious theory, and present it as a life and death question.\u2014Letter\n136a, 1898.\nThe Need for Clear Discernment\nAs we near the time when principalities and powers and spiritual\nwickedness in high places will be brought into warfare against the\ntruth, when the deceiving power of Satan will be so great that if\nit were possible he will deceive the very elect, we must have our\ndiscernment sharpened by divine enlightenment, that we may know\nthe spirit that is of God, that we may not be ignorant of Satan\u2019s\ndevices. Human effort must combine with divine power, that we\nmay be able to accomplish the closing work for this time.\nChrist uses the wind as a symbol of the Spirit of God. As the\nwind bloweth whither it listeth, and we cannot tell whence it cometh\nor whither it goeth, so it is with the Spirit of God. We do not know\nthrough whom it will be manifested.\nBut I speak not my own words when I say that God\u2019s Spirit[16]\nwill pass by those who have had their day of test and opportunity,\nbut who have not distinguished the voice of God or appreciated the\nmovings of His Spirit. Then thousands in the eleventh hour will see\nand acknowledge the truth.\n\u201cBehold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the plowman shall\novertake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed\u201d\n(Amos 9:13).\nThese conversions to truth will be made with a rapidity that will\nsurprise the church, and God\u2019s name alone will be glorified.\u2014Letter\n43, 1890.\nFanaticism to Appear in Our Midst\nFanaticism will appear in the very midst of us. Deceptions will\ncome, and of such a character that if it were possible they would\nWarnings Against Sensational Teachings and Emotional Religion 19\nmislead the very elect. If marked inconsistencies and untruthful\nutterances were apparent in these manifestations, the words from\nthe lips of the Great Teacher would not be needed. It is because of\nthe many and varied dangers that would arise, that this warning is\ngiven.\nThe reason why I hang out the danger signal is that through\nthe enlightenment of the Spirit of God I can see that which my\nbrethren do not discern. It may not be a positive necessity for me\nto point out all these peculiar phases of deception that they will\nneed to guard against. It is enough for me to tell you, Be on your\nguard; and as faithful sentinels keep the flock of God from accepting\nindiscriminately all that professes to be communicated to them from\nthe Lord. If we work to create an excitement of feeling, we shall\nhave all we want, and more than we can possibly know how to\nmanage. Calmly and clearly \u201cPreach the word.\u201d We must not regard\nit as our work to create an excitement.\nThe Holy Spirit of God alone can create a healthy enthusiasm.\nLet God work, and let the human agent walk softly before Him,\nwatching, waiting, praying, looking unto Jesus every moment, led [17]\nand controlled by the precious Spirit, which is light and life.\u2014Letter\n68, 1894.\nThe end is near. The children of light are to work with earnest,\npersevering zeal to lead others to prepare for the great event before\nus, that they may be able to resist the enemy because they have\nallowed the Holy Spirit to work upon their hearts. New and strange\nthings will continually arise to lead God\u2019s people into false excite-\nment, religious revivals, and curious developments. Let them keep\nadvancing, with their eyes fixed alone upon the Light and Life of the\nworld. Know that everything that is called light and truth in the Word\nof God is light and truth, an emanation from divine wisdom, not an\nimitation of Satan\u2019s subtle arts. The light of God\u2019s wisdom will be\nto every true, steadfast, contrite soul as a lamp to his feet.\u2014Letter\n45, 1899.\nFeeling Not to Master Judgment\nWith much that is truth there is mingled error that is accepted\nin its extreme meaning, and acted upon by persons of excitable\n20 Selected Messages Book 2\ntemperament. Thus fanaticism will take the place of well-regulated,\nwell-disciplined, heaven-ordained efforts to carry forward the work\nto its completion....\nThere is danger, not only that unbalanced minds will be led into\nfanaticism, but that designing persons will take advantage of this\nexcitement to further their own selfish purposes....\nI have a warning to give to our brethren, that they shall follow\ntheir Leader and not run ahead of Christ. Let there be no haphazard\nwork in these times. Beware of making strong expressions which\nwill lead unbalanced minds to think that they have wonderful light\nfrom God. The one who bears a message to the people from God\nmust exercise perfect control. He should ever bear in mind that the\npath of presumption lies close beside the path of faith....\nOnce let impulse and emotion get the mastery over calm judg-\nment, and there may be altogether too much speed, even in traveling\na right road. He who travels too fast will find it perilous in more\nways than one. It may not be long before he will branch off from[18]\nthe right road into a wrong path.\nNot once should feeling be allowed to get the mastery over\njudgment. There is danger of excess in that which is lawful, and that\nwhich is not lawful will surely lead into false paths. If there is not\ncareful, earnest, sensible work, solid as a rock in the advancement of\nevery idea and principle, and in every representation given, souls will\nbe ruined.\u2014Letter 6a, 1894. [For fuller context see pages 90-92.]\nObedience Versus Emotion or Rapture\nThere is danger of those in our ranks making a mistake in regard\nto receiving the Holy Ghost. Many suppose an emotion or a rapture\nof feeling to be an evidence of the presence of the Holy Spirit.\nThere is danger that right sentiments will not be understood, and that\nChrist\u2019s words, \u201cTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I\nhave commanded you\u201d (Matthew 28:20), will lose their significance.\nThere is danger that original devisings and superstitious imaginings\nwill take the place of the Scriptures. Tell our people: \u201cBe not\nanxious to bring in something not revealed in the Word. Keep close\nto Christ\u201d....\nWarnings Against Sensational Teachings and Emotional Religion 21\nLet us remember that the Word Christ has commanded us to\npreach to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples is confirmed\nby the Holy Spirit. This is God\u2019s plan of work. Christ is the mighty\npower which confirms the Word, bringing men and women, through\nconversion to the truth, to an understanding faith, making them\nwilling to do whatsoever He has commanded them. The human\nagent, the seen instrument, is to preach the Word, and the Lord\nJesus, the unseen, agency, by His Holy Spirit is to make the Word\nefficacious and powerful.\u2014Letter 105, 1900.\nA Call for Old-fashioned Sermons\nA new order of things has come into the ministry. There is a\ndesire to pattern after other churches, and simplicity and humility\nare almost unknown. The young ministers seek to be original, and [19]\nto introduce new ideas and new plans for labor. Some open revival\nmeetings, and by this means call large numbers into the church. But\nwhen the excitement is over, where are the converted ones? Repen-\ntance and confession of sin are not seen. The sinner is entreated to\nbelieve in Christ and accept Him, without regard to his past life of\nsin and rebellion. The heart is not broken. There is no contrition of\nsoul. The supposed converted ones have not fallen upon the Rock,\nChrist Jesus.\nThe Old and New Testament Scriptures show us the only way\nin which this work should be done. Repent, repent, repent was the\nmessage rung out by John the Baptist in the wilderness. Christ\u2019s\nmessage to the people was \u201cExcept ye repent, ye shall all likewise\nperish\u201d (Luke 13:5). And the apostles were commanded to preach\neverywhere that men should repent.\nThe Lord desires His servants today to preach the old gospel\ndoctrine, sorrow for sin, repentance, and confession. We want old-\nfashioned sermons, old-fashioned customs, old-fashioned fathers\nand mothers in Israel. The sinner must be labored for, perseveringly,\nearnestly, wisely, until he shall see that he is a transgressor of God\u2019s\nlaw, and shall exercise repentance toward God, and faith toward the\nLord Jesus Christ\u2014Manuscript 82, 1894.\n22 Selected Messages Book 2\nCold Formalism or Fanaticism\nFormality, worldly wisdom, worldly caution, worldly policy, will\nappear to many to be the very power of God, but when accepted, it\nstands as an obstacle to prevent God\u2019s light in warnings, reproof,\nand counsel from coming to the world.\nHe [Satan] is working with all his insinuating, deceiving power,\nto lead men away from the third angel\u2019s message, which is to be\nproclaimed with mighty power. If Satan sees that the Lord is blessing\nHis people and preparing them to discern his delusions, he will work\nwith his master power to bring in fanaticism on the one hand and\ncold formalism on the other, that he may gather in a harvest of souls.\nNow is our time to watch unceasingly. Watch, bar the way to the[20]\nleast step of advance that Satan may make among you.\nThere are dangers to be guarded against on the right hand and on\nthe left. There will be inexperienced ones, newly come to the faith,\nwho need to be strengthened, and to have a correct example before\nthem. Some will not make a right use of the doctrine of justification\nby faith. They will present it in a one-sided manner.\nOthers will seize the ideas that have not been correctly presented,\nand will go clear over the mark, ignoring works altogether.\nNow genuine faith always works by love. When you look to\nCalvary it is not to quiet your soul in the nonperformance of duty, not\nto compose yourself to sleep, but to create faith in Jesus, faith that\nwill work, purifying the soul from the slime of selfishness. When we\nlay hold of Christ by faith, our work has just begun. Every man has\ncorrupt and sinful habits that must be overcome by vigorous warfare.\nEvery soul is required to fight the fight of faith. If one is a follower of\nChrist, he cannot be sharp in deal, he cannot be hardhearted, devoid\nof sympathy. He cannot be coarse in his speech. He cannot be full\nof pomposity and self-esteem. He cannot be overbearing, nor can he\nuse harsh words, and censure and condemn.\nThe labor of love springs from the work of faith. Bible religion\nmeans constant work. \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that\nthey may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in\nheaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16). Work out your own salvation with fear and\ntrembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of\nHis good pleasure. We are to be zealous of good works, be careful\nWarnings Against Sensational Teachings and Emotional Religion 23\nto maintain good works. And the true Witness says: \u201cI know thy\nworks\u201d (Revelation 2:2).\nWhile it is true that our busy activities will not in themselves\nensure salvation, it is also true that faith which unites us to Christ\nwill stir the soul to activity.\nThose who have no time to give attention to their own souls, to\nexamine themselves daily whether they be in the love of God, and\nplace themselves in the channel of light, will have time to give to [21]\nthe suggestions of Satan and the working out of his plans.\nSatan will insinuate himself by little wedges, which widen as\nthey make a place for themselves. The specious devices of Satan will\nbe brought into the special work of God at this time.\u2014Manuscript\n16, 1890.\nFalse Ideas of God\u2019s Blessing\nMany are questioning and troubled. This is because they have\nnot faith in God. With some, religious exercises mean little more\nthan a good time. When their feelings are aroused, they think they\nare greatly blessed. Some do not think they are blessed unless they\nare stirred and excited. The intoxication of excitement is the object\nthey are seeking; and if they do not obtain this, they suppose they\nare all wrong, or that someone else is all wrong.\nPeople should not be educated to think that religion of an emo-\ntional order, bordering on fanaticism, is the only pure religion. Under\nthe influence of such religion the minister is expected to use all his\nnervous energy in preaching the gospel. He must pour forth with\nabundance the strong current of the water of life. He must bring stim-\nulating draughts that will be acceptable to human appetite. There\nare those who, unless their decaying emotions are stimulated, think\nthey can be careless and inattentive.\u2014Letter 89, 1902.\nAll is Quiet, Calm, Unpretending\nThe enemy is preparing to deceive the whole world by his mira-\ncle-working power. He will assume to personate the angels of light,\nto personate Jesus Christ. Every one who teaches the truth for this\ntime is to preach the Word. Those who cling to the Word will not\n24 Selected Messages Book 2\nthrow open the doors for Satan by making unguarded statements in\nreference to prophesying or to dreams and visions. To a greater or\nless degree false manifestations have been coming in, here and there,\nsince 1844, after the time when we looked for the second coming\nof Christ.... We shall have them more and more, and like faithful[22]\nsentinels we must be on guard. Letters are coming to me from many\npersons concerning visions which they have had and feel it their\nduty to relate. May the Lord help His servants to be cautious.\nWhen the Lord has a genuine channel of light, there are always\nplenty of counterfeits. Satan will surely enter any door thrown open\nfor him. He will give messages of truth mingling with the truth ideas\nof his own, prepared to mislead souls, to draw the mind to human\nbeings and their sayings, and prevent it from holding firmly to a\n\u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d In God\u2019s dealings with His people, all is quiet;\nwith those who trust in Him, all is calm and unpretending. There\nwill be simple, true, earnest believers in the Bible, and there will be\ndoers of the Word as well as hearers. There will be sound, earnest,\nsensible waiting upon God.\u2014Letter 102, 1894.\nThe Example of Christ\nLet not anyone be afraid of going to extremes while he is a close\nstudent of the Word, humbling the soul at every step. Christ must\ndwell in him by faith. He, their Exemplar, was self-possessed. He\nwalked in humility. He had true dignity. He had patience. If we\nindividually possess these traits of character, who accept justification\nby faith, there will be no extremists....\nThe example of Christ is before us, ever to keep the law and the\ngospel closely connected. They cannot be separated. Let calmness\nand self-possession be cultivated and perseveringly maintained, for\nthis was the character of Christ. We hear the vehement expressions\nof false religionists who make bold pretensions, who talk loud and\nlong, saying, \u201cI am holy, I am sinless,\u201d when they have not the least\nfoundation for their faith. We hear no noisy protestations of faith,\nnor do we see tremendous bodily contortions and exercises in the\nAuthor of all truth.\nRemember in Him dwelt all the fullness of the God-head bodily.\nIf Christ is abiding in our hearts by faith, we shall, by beholding\nWarnings Against Sensational Teachings and Emotional Religion 25\nthe manner of His life, seek to be like Jesus, pure, peaceable, and\nundefiled. We shall reveal Christ in our character. We will not [23]\nonly receive and absorb light but will also diffuse it. We will have\nmore clear and distinct views of what Jesus is to us. The symmetry,\nloveliness, and benevolence that were in the life of Jesus Christ will\nbe shining forth in our lives.\u2014Manuscript 24, 1890.\nA Desire to Change the Present Order\nInstead of living in expectation of some special season of ex-\ncitement, we are wisely to improve present opportunity, doing that\nwhich must be done in order that souls may be saved. Instead of\nexhausting the powers of our mind in speculations in regard to the\ntimes and seasons which the Lord has placed in His own power,\nand withheld from men, we are to yield ourselves to the control\nof the Holy Spirit, to do present duties, to give the bread of life,\nunadulterated with human opinions, to souls who are perishing for\nthe truth....\nWe are in continual danger of getting above the simplicity of the\ngospel. There is an intense desire on the part of many to startle the\nworld with something original, that shall lift the people into a state of\nspiritual ecstasy, and change the present order of experience. There\nis certainly great need of a change in the present order of experience;\nfor the sacredness of present truth is not realized as it should be, but\nthe change we need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained\nby seeking God individually for His blessing, by pleading with Him\nfor His power, by fervently praying that His grace may come upon\nus, and that our characters may be transformed. This is the change\nwe need today, and for the attainment of this experience we should\nexercise persevering energy and manifest heartfelt earnestness.\u2014\nThe Review and Herald, March 22, 1892.\nNo Oddities or Eccentricities\nLet there be no oddities or eccentricities of movement on the part\nof those who speak the Word of truth, for such things will weaken the\nimpression that should be made by the Word. We must be guarded,\nfor Satan is determined, if possible, to intermingle with religious\n26 Selected Messages Book 2\nservices his evil influence. Let there be no theatrical display, for this[24]\nwill not help to strengthen belief in the Word of God. Rather, it will\ndivert attention to the human instrument.\u2014Letter 352, 1908.\nGod\u2019s Word to Be Uncontaminated by Fallacies\nAmid the confusing cries, \u201cLo, here is Christ! Lo, there is\nChrist!\u201d will be borne a special testimony, a special message of\ntruth appropriate for this time, which message is to be received,\nbelieved, and acted upon. It is the truth, not fanciful ideas, that is\nefficacious. The eternal truth of the Word will stand forth free from\nall seductive errors and spiritualistic interpretations, free from all\nfancifully drawn, alluring pictures. Falsehoods will be urged upon\nthe attention of God\u2019s people, but the truth is to stand clothed in its\nbeautiful, pure garments. The Word, precious in its holy, uplifting\ninfluence, is not to be degraded to a level with common, ordinary\nmatters. It is always to remain uncontaminated by the fallacies\nby which Satan seeks to deceive, if possible, the very elect.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, October 13, 1904.\nLet God\u2019s people act so that the world will see that Seventh-day\nAdventists are an intelligent, thinking people, whose faith is based\non a surer foundation than the bedlam of confusion. The people are\nhungry for the bread of life. Do not offer them a stone.\u2014Manuscript\n101, 1901.\nChapter 2\u2014Early Fanaticism to be Repeated [25]\nRemoving the Landmarks\nOur people need to understand the reasons of our faith and our\npast experiences. How sad it is that so many of them apparently\nplace unlimited confidence in men who present theories tending to\nuproot our past experiences and to remove the old landmarks! Those\nwho can so easily be led by a false spirit show that they have been\nfollowing the wrong captain for some time\u2014so long that they do\nnot discern that they are departing from the faith, or that they are\nnot building upon the true foundation. We need to urge all to put on\ntheir spiritual eyeglasses, to have their eyes anointed that they may\nsee clearly and discern the true pillars of the faith. Then they will\nknow that \u201cthe foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal,\nThe Lord knoweth them that are his\u201d (2 Timothy 2:19). We need to\nrevive the old evidences of the faith once delivered to the saints.\nEvery conceivable fanciful and deceptive doctrine will be pre-\nsented by men who think that they have the truth. Some are now\nteaching that children will be born in the new earth. Is this present\ntruth? Who has inspired these men to present such a theory? Did\nthe Lord give anyone such views?\u2014No; those things which are re-\nvealed are for us and our children, but upon subjects not revealed,\nand having nought to do with our salvation, silence is eloquence. [26]\nThese strange ideas should not even be mentioned, much less taught\nas essential truths.\nWe have reached a time when things are to be called by their right\nname. As we did in the earlier days, we must arise, and, under the\nSpirit of God, rebuke the work of deception. Some of the sentiments\nnow expressed are the alpha of some of the most fanatical ideas that\ncould be presented. Teachings similar to those we had to meet soon\nafter 1844 are being taught by some who occupy important positions\nin the work of God.\n27\n28 Selected Messages Book 2\nIn New Hampshire, in Vermont, and in other places we had to\nresist the stealthy, deceptive work of fanaticism. Presumptuous sins\nwere committed, and unholy lusts were freely indulged by some,\nunder the cloak of sanctification. The doctrine of spiritual free-love\nwas advocated. We saw the fulfillment of the scripture \u201cthat in the\nlatter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing\nspirits, and doctrines of devils\u201d (1 Timothy 4:1).\u2014The Southern\nWatchman, April 5, 1904.\nBodily Demonstrations Not Demanded\nTrue religion does not demand great bodily demonstrations....\nThese are no evidence of the presence of the Spirit of God. In\n1843 and 1844 we were called to meet just such fanaticism. Men\nwould say, I have the Holy Spirit of God, and they would come into\nthe meeting and roll just like a hoop; and because some would not\nreceive this as evidence of the working of the Spirit of God, they\nwere looked upon as wicked people. The Lord sent me into the midst\nof this fanaticism.... Some would come to me and ask, Why do you\nnot join with them? I said, I have another Leader than this, One who\nis meek and lowly in heart, One who made no such demonstrations\nas you are making here, nor such boasts. These demonstrations are\nnot of Christ but of the devil.\u2014Manuscript 97, 1909.\nA Claim to Be Sealed and Holy\nIn 1850 my husband and myself visited Vermont, Canada, New\nHampshire, and Maine. The meetings were held in private houses.[27]\nIt was then next to impossible to obtain access to unbelievers. The\ndisappointment in 1844 had confused the minds of many, and they\nwould not listen to any explanation of the matter. They were impa-\ntient and unbelieving, and many seemed rebellious, coming out in\na most decided manner against their past Advent experience. Oth-\ners dared not go to this length, and deny the way the Lord had led\nthem. These were glad to hear arguments from the Word of God\nwhich would harmonize our position with prophetic history. As they\nlistened to an explanation of the disappointment which had been so\nbitter to them, they saw that God indeed led them, and they rejoiced\nEarly Fanaticism to be Repeated 29\nin the truth. This awakened the most bitter opposition on the part of\nthose who denied our past experience.\nBut we had a still worse element to meet in a class who claimed\nthat they were sanctified, that they could not sin, that they were\nsealed and holy, and that all their impressions and notions were the\nmind of God. Conscientious souls were deceived by the pretended\npiety of these fanatics. Satan had worked artfully to have these\ndeluded ones accept the Sabbath, as through their influence, while\nprofessing to believe one part of the truth, he could crowd upon\nthe people a great many errors. He could also use them to good\nadvantage to disgust unbelievers, who pointed to these inconsistent,\nunreasonable ones as representatives of Seventh-day Adventists.\nThis class urged upon the people human tests and manufactured\ncrosses, which Christ had not given them to bear.\nThey claimed to heal the sick and to work miracles. They had a\nsatanic, bewitching power; yet they were over-bearing, dictatorial,\nand cruelly oppressive. The Lord used us as instruments to rebuke\nthese fanatics, and to open the eyes of His faithful people to the true\ncharacter of their work. Peace and joy came into the hearts of those\nwho broke away from this deception of Satan, and they glorified\nGod as they saw His unerring wisdom in setting before them the\nlight of truth and its precious fruits in contrast with satanic heresies\nand delusions. The truth shone in contrast with these deceptions [28]\nlike clear gold amid the rubbish of earth.\u2014The Review and Herald,\nNovember 20, 1883.\nMarring the Sacredness of the Work\nI am charged to keep ever before our people\u2014ministers of the\ngospel, and all who claim to be giving the light of truth to the world\u2014\nthe danger of marring the sacredness of God\u2019s work by allowing\nthe mind to consent to a cheap interpretation of the way that God\ndesires His work to be done. I have had special instruction given\nme regarding bringing human plans and devisings into the work of\nmaking known to the world the truth for this time.\nAgain and again in past years I have been bidden to speak in\nprotest against the fanciful and forbidden schemes that have been\npresented by one and another. My message has ever been, Preach\n30 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe Word in simplicity and all humility; present clear, unadulterated\ntruth to the people. Open no door to fanatical movements, for the\ninfluence of these is to bring confusion of mind and discouragement\nand lack of faith to God\u2019s people....\nWhenever I have been called to meet fanaticism in its varied\nforms, I have received clear, positive, and definite instruction to lift\nmy voice against its influence. With some the evil has revealed itself\nin the form of man-made tests for ascertaining a knowledge of the\nwill of God; and I was shown that this was a delusion which became\nan infatuation, and that it is contrary to the will of the Lord. If we\nfollow such methods, we shall be found aiding the enemy\u2019s plans. In\ntimes past certain among the believers had great faith in the setting\nof signs by which to decide their duty. Some had such confidence in\nthese signs that men went so far as to exchange wives, thus bringing\nadultery into the church.\nI have been shown that deceptions like those we were called to\nmeet in the early experiences of the message would be repeated,\nand that we shall have to meet them again in the closing days of the\nwork. At this time we are required to bring all our powers under the\ncontrol of God, exercising our faculties in accordance with the light\nHe has given. Read the fourth and fifth chapters of Matthew. Study[29]\nMatthew 4:8-10; also Chapter 5:13. Meditate upon the sacred work\nthat was carried forward by Christ. It is thus that the principles of\nthe Word of God are to be brought into our labors.\u2014Letter 36, 1911.\nMaintaining Propriety In Deportment\nAfter the passing of the time in 1844, fanaticism came into the\nranks of Adventists. God gave messages of warning to stay the\nincoming evil. There was too great familiarity between some men\nand women. I presented to them the holy standard of truth that we\nshould reach, and the purity of deportment that we should maintain,\nin order to meet the approval of God and be without spot or wrinkle\nor any such thing. Most solemn denunciations from God were given\nto men and women whose thoughts were running in an impure\nchannel, while they claimed to be especially favored of God; but the\nmessage God gave was despised and rejected....\nEarly Fanaticism to be Repeated 31\nWe are not out of danger even now. Every soul who engages to\ngive to the world the message of warning will be sorely tempted to\npursue such a course in life as will deny his faith.\nWe must as workers be united in frowning down and condemning\nanything that bears the least approach to evil, in our associations\nwith one another. Our faith is holy; our work is to vindicate the\nhonor of God\u2019s law, and is not of a character to bring anyone down\nto a low level in thought or in deportment. There are many who\nclaim to believe and teach the truth who have error and fanciful ideas\nof their own mingled with the truth. But there is an exalted platform\nfor us to stand upon. We must believe and teach the truth as it is in\nJesus. Holiness of heart will never lead to impure actions. When\none who claims to be teaching the truth is inclined to be much in\nthe company of young or even married women, when he familiarly\nlays his hand upon their person, or is often found conversing with\nthem in a familiar manner, be afraid of him; the pure principles of\ntruth are not inwrought in his soul. Such are not workers with Jesus; [30]\nthey are not in Christ, and Christ is not abiding in them. They need\na thorough conversion before God can accept their labors.\nThe truth of heavenly origin never degrades the receiver, never\nleads him to the least approach to undue familiarity; on the contrary,\nit sanctifies the believer, refines his taste, elevates and ennobles\nhim, and brings him into a close connection with Jesus. It leads\nhim to regard the apostle Paul\u2019s injunction to abstain from even the\nappearance of evil, lest his good should be evil spoken of.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, November 10, 1885.\n[For further references to early fanaticism see Life Sketches, 85-\n94; Testimonies for the Church 1:71-73; Testimonies for the Church\n8:291, 292; Gospel Workers, 316, 317.]\nChapter 3\u2014The \u201cHoly Flesh\u201d Doctrine[31]\n[A fanatical teaching termed \u201cThe Doctrine of Holy Flesh\u201d was\nstarted in 1900 in Indiana, leading the conference president and\nvarious workers into serious error. This theory alleged that those who\nfollow the Saviour must have their fallen natures perfected by passing\nthrough a \u201cGarden of Gethsemane\u201d experience, thus acquiring a state\nof physical sinlessness as an essential preparation for translation.\nEyewitness accounts report that in their services the fanatics worked\nup a high pitch of excitement by use of musical instruments such as\norgans, flutes, fiddles, tambourines, horns, and even a big bass drum.\nThey sought a physical demonstration and shouted and prayed and\nsang until someone in the congregation would fall, prostrate and\nunconscious, from his seat. One or two men, walking up and down\nthe aisle for the purpose, would drag the fallen person up on the\nrostrum. Then about a dozen individuals would gather around the\nprostrate body, some singing, some shouting, and some praying,\nall at the same time. When the subject revived, he was counted\namong those who had passed through the Gethsemane experience,\nhad obtained holy flesh, and had translation faith. Thereafter, it was\nasserted, he could not sin and would never die. Elders S. N. Haskell\nand A. J. Breed, two of our leading denominational ministers, were\nsent to the camp meeting held at Muncie, Indiana, from September\n13 to 23, 1900, to meet this fanaticism. These developments were\nrevealed to Mrs. White while she was in Australia in January, 1900,\nand she bore testimony of warning and reproof against it, as seen in\nthe two following messages.\u2014Compilers.]\nA Repetition of Early Fanaticism\n[A statement read by Mrs. E. G. White before the ministers at\nthe General Conference, April 17, 1901.]\nInstruction has been given me in regard to the late experience of\nbrethren in Indiana and the teaching they have given to the churches.[32]\n32\n\u201cHoly Flesh\u201d Doctrine 33\nThrough this experience and teaching the enemy has been working\nto lead souls astray.\nThe teaching given in regard to what is termed \u201choly flesh\u201d is an\nerror. All may now obtain holy hearts, but it is not correct to claim\nin this life to have holy flesh. The apostle Paul declares, \u201cI know\nthat in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing\u201d (Romans\n7:18). To those who have tried so hard to obtain by faith so-called\nholy flesh, I would say, You cannot obtain it. Not a soul of you has\nholy flesh now. No human being on the earth has holy flesh. It is an\nimpossibility.\nIf those who speak so freely of perfection in the flesh, could\nsee things in the true light, they would recoil with horror from their\npresumptuous ideas. In showing the fallacy of their assumptions in\nregard to holy flesh, the Lord is seeking to prevent men and women\nfrom putting on His words a construction which leads to pollution\nof body, soul, and spirit. Let this phase of doctrine be carried a little\nfurther, and it will lead to the claim that its advocates cannot sin;\nthat since they have holy flesh, their actions are all holy. What a\ndoor of temptation would thus be opened!\nThe Scriptures teach us to seek for the sanctification to God of\nbody, soul, and spirit. In this work we are to be laborers together with\nGod. Much may be done to restore the moral image of God in man, to\nimprove the physical, mental, and moral capabilities. Great changes\ncan be made in the physical system by obeying the laws of God and\nbringing into the body nothing that defiles. And while we cannot\nclaim perfection of the flesh, we may have Christian perfection of the\nsoul. Through the sacrifice made in our behalf, sins may be perfectly\nforgiven. Our dependence is not in what man can do; it is in what\nGod can do for man through Christ. When we surrender ourselves\nwholly to God, and fully believe, the blood of Christ cleanses from\nall sin. The conscience can be freed from condemnation. Through\nfaith in His blood, all may be made perfect in Christ Jesus. Thank\nGod that we are not dealing with impossibilities. We may claim\nsanctification. We may enjoy the favor of God. We are not to be\nanxious about what Christ and God think of us, but about what God [33]\nthinks of Christ, our Substitute. Ye are accepted in the Beloved.\nThe Lord shows, to the repenting, believing one, that Christ accepts\n34 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe surrender of the soul, to be molded and fashioned after His own\nlikeness.\nIn His life on earth, Christ could have made disclosures which\nwould have eclipsed and assigned to oblivion all human discoveries.\nHe could have opened door after door to mysterious things, and many\nrevelations of eternal realities would have been the sure result. He\ncould have uttered words which would have been as a key to unlock\nmysteries that would have captivated the minds of generations to the\nclose of time. But Christ does not open the numerous doors at which\nhuman curiosity has been striving to obtain entrance. He does not\nspread for men a feast that would prove deleterious to their highest\ninterests. He came to plant for men, not the tree of knowledge, but\nthe tree of life....\nI have been instructed to say to those in Indiana who are ad-\nvocating strange doctrines, You are giving a wrong mold to the\nprecious and important work of God. Keep within the bounds of the\nBible. Take Christ\u2019s lessons, and repeat them over and over again.\nRemember that \u201cthe wisdom that is from above is first pure, then\npeaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good\nfruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of\nrighteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace\u201d (James\n3:17, 18).\nWhen human beings receive holy flesh, they will not remain on\nthe earth, but will be taken to heaven. While sin is forgiven in this\nlife, its results are not now wholly removed. It is at His coming that\nChrist is to \u201cchange our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto\nhis glorious body\u201d (Philippians 3:21)....\nAgain and again in the progress of our work, fanatical move-\nments have arisen, and when the matter was presented before me, I\nhave had to bear a message similar to the message I am bearing to\nmy brethren from Indiana. I have been instructed by the Lord that\nthis movement in Indiana is of the same character as have been the\nmovements in years past. In your religious meetings there have been[34]\nexercises similar to those I have witnessed in connection with those\nmovements in the past.\nIn the period of disappointment after the passing of the time\nin 1844, fanaticism in various forms arose. Some held that the\nresurrection of the righteous dead had already taken place. I was\n\u201cHoly Flesh\u201d Doctrine 35\nsent to bear a message to those believing this, as I am now bearing a\nmessage to you. They declared that they were perfected, that body,\nsoul, and spirit were holy. They made demonstrations similar to\nthose you have made, and confused their own minds and the minds\nof others by their wonderful suppositions. Yet these persons were\nour beloved brethren, and we were longing to help them. I went\ninto their meetings. There was much excitement, with noise and\nconfusion. One could not tell what was piped or what was harped.\nSome appeared to be in vision, and fell to the floor. Others were\njumping, dancing, and shouting. They declared that as their flesh\nwas purified, they were ready for translation. This they repeated\nagain and again. I bore my testimony in the name of the Lord,\nplacing His rebuke upon these manifestations.\nSome who had engaged in these movements were brought to\ntheir right mind, and saw their delusion. Some had been excellent,\nhonest people, but they thought that sanctified flesh could not sin,\nand thus they had been taken in Satan\u2019s trap. They had carried their\nstrong ideas so far that they became a reproach to the precious cause\nof God. These sorely repented, and some were afterward among our\nmost reliable men and women. But there were others who ever after\nwalked in sadness. We could not at any time make them feel that\nthey were worthy to work for the Master, whose precious cause they\nhad so greatly dishonored.\nAs the result of fanatical movements such as I have described,\npersons in no way responsible for them have in some cases lost their\nreason. They could not harmonize the scenes of excitement and\ntumult with their own past precious experience; they were pressed\nbeyond measure to receive the message of error; it was represented\nto them that unless they did this they would be lost; and as the result [35]\ntheir mind was unbalanced, and some became insane. These things\nbring a reproach upon the cause of truth, and hinder the proclamation\nof the last message of mercy to the world.\nShouting No Evidence of Sanctification\nThe manner in which the meetings in Indiana have been carried\non, with noise and confusion, does not commend them to thoughtful,\nintelligent minds. There is nothing in these demonstrations which\n36 Selected Messages Book 2\nwill convince the world that we have the truth. Mere noise and\nshouting are no evidence of sanctification, or of the descent of the\nHoly Spirit. Your wild demonstrations create only disgust in the\nminds of unbelievers. The fewer of such demonstrations there are,\nthe better it will be for the actors and for the people in general.\nFanaticism, once started and left unchecked, is as hard to quench\nas a fire which has obtained hold of a building. Those who have\nentered into and sustained this fanaticism, might far better be en-\ngaged in secular labor; for by their inconsistent course of action they\nare dishonoring the Lord and imperiling His people. Many such\nmovements will arise at this time, when the Lord\u2019s work should\nstand elevated, pure, unadulterated with superstition and fables. We\nneed to be on our guard, to maintain a close connection with Christ,\nthat we be not deceived by Satan\u2019s devices.\nThe Lord desires to have in His service order and discipline, not\nexcitement and confusion. We are not now able to describe with\naccuracy the scenes to be enacted in our world in the future; but this\nwe do know, that this is a time when we must watch unto prayer;\nfor the great day of the Lord is at hand. Satan is rallying his forces.\nWe need to be thoughtful and still, and to contemplate the truths of\nrevelation. Excitement is not favorable to growth in grace, to true\npurity and sanctification of the spirit.\nGod wants us to deal with sacred truth. This alone will convince\nthe gainsayer. Calm, sensible labor must be put forth, to convince\nsouls of their condition, to show them the character building which[36]\nmust be carried on if a beautiful structure is raised for the Lord.\nMinds that are awakened must be patiently instructed if they rightly\nunderstand and duly appreciate the truths of the Word.\nGod calls upon His people to walk with sobriety and holy consis-\ntency. They should be very careful not to misrepresent and dishonor\nthe holy doctrines of truth by strange performances, by confusion\nand tumult. By this, unbelievers are led to think that Seventh-day\nAdventists are a set of fanatics. Thus prejudice is created that pre-\nvents souls from receiving the message for this time. When believers\nspeak the truth as it is in Jesus, they reveal a holy, sensible calm, not\na storm of confusion.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin, April 23,\n1901.\n\u201cHoly Flesh\u201d Doctrine 37\nWorship With a Bedlam of Noise\nIt is impossible to estimate too largely the work that the Lord\nwill accomplish through His proposed vessels in carrying out His\nmind and purpose. The things you have described as taking place\nin Indiana, the Lord has shown me would take place just before the\nclose of probation. Every uncouth thing will be demonstrated. There\nwill be shouting, with drums, music, and dancing. The senses of\nrational beings will become so confused that they cannot be trusted\nto make right decisions. And this is called the moving of the Holy\nSpirit.\nThe Holy Spirit never reveals itself in such methods, in such a\nbedlam of noise. This is an invention of Satan to cover up his inge-\nnious methods for making of none effect the pure, sincere, elevating,\nennobling, sanctifying truth for this time. Better never have the\nworship of God blended with music than to use musical instruments\nto do the work which last January was represented to me would\nbe brought into our camp meetings. The truth for this time needs\nnothing of this kind in its work of converting souls. A bedlam of\nnoise shocks the senses and perverts that which if conducted aright\nmight be a blessing. The powers of satanic agencies blend with the\ndin and noise, to have a carnival, and this is termed the Holy Spirit\u2019s\nworking.\nWhen the camp meeting is ended, the good which ought to have [37]\nbeen done and which might have been done by the presentation of\nsacred truth is not accomplished. Those participating in the supposed\nrevival receive impressions which lead them adrift. They cannot tell\nwhat they formerly knew regarding Bible principles.\nNo encouragement should be given to this kind of worship. The\nsame kind of influence came in after the passing of the time in 1844.\nThe same kind of representations were made. Men became excited,\nand were worked by a power thought to be the power of God\nHistory of the Past to Be Repeated\nI will not go into all the painful history; it is too much. But last\nJanuary the Lord showed me that erroneous theories and methods\nwould be brought into our camp meetings, and that the history of\nthe past would be repeated. I felt greatly distressed. I was instructed\n38 Selected Messages Book 2\nto say that at these demonstrations demons in the form of men are\npresent, working with all the ingenuity that Satan can employ to\nmake the truth disgusting to sensible people; that the enemy was\ntrying to arrange matters so that the camp meetings, which have\nbeen the means of bringing the truth of the third angel\u2019s message\nbefore multitudes, should lose their force and influence.\nThe third angel\u2019s message is to be given in straight lines. It is to\nbe kept free from every thread of the cheap, miserable inventions of\nmen\u2019s theories, prepared by the father of lies, and disguised as was\nthe brilliant serpent used by Satan as a medium of deceiving our first\nparents. Thus Satan tries to put his stamp upon the work God would\nhave stand forth in purity.\nThe Holy Spirit has nothing to do with such a confusion of noise\nand multitude of sounds as passed before me last January. Satan\nworks amid the din and confusion of such music, which, properly\nconducted, would be a praise and glory to God. He makes its effect\nlike the poison sting of the serpent.\nThose things which have been in the past will be in the future.[38]\nSatan will make music a snare by the way in which it is conducted.\nGod calls upon His people, who have the light before them in the\nWord and in the Testimonies, to read and consider, and to take heed.\nClear and definite instruction has been given in order that all may\nunderstand. But the itching desire to originate something new results\nin strange doctrines, and largely destroys the influence of those who\nwould be a power for good if they held firm the beginning of their\nconfidence in the truth the Lord had given them.\n\u201cTherefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things\nwhich we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip [mar-\ngin: \u201crun out as leaking vessels\u201d]. For if the word spoken by angels\nwas stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a\njust recompence of reward; how shall we escape, if we neglect so\ngreat salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,\nand was confirmed unto us by them that heard him?\u201d (Hebrews\n2:1-3). \u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil\nheart of unbelief, in departing from the living God. But exhort one\nanother daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened\nthrough the deceitfulness of sin. For we are made partakers of Christ,\n\u201cHoly Flesh\u201d Doctrine 39\nif we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end\u201d\n(Hebrews 3:12-14).\nBrother and Sister Haskell, we must put on every piece of the\narmor, and having done all, stand firm. We are set as a defense for\nthe gospel, and we must compose a part of the Lord\u2019s grand army\nfor aggressive warfare. By the Lord\u2019s faithful ambassadors the truth\nmust be presented in clear-cut lines. Much of that which today is\ncalled testing truth is twaddle which leads to a resistance of the Holy\nSpirit.. . .\nDefective Presentation Regarding the Holy Spirit\nMuch is being said regarding the impartation of the Holy Spirit,\nand by some this is being so interpreted that it is an injury to the\nchurches. Eternal life is the receiving of the living elements in the [39]\nScriptures and doing the will of God. This is eating the flesh and\ndrinking the blood of the Son of God. To those who do this, life\nand immortality are brought to light through the gospel, for God\u2019s\nWord is verity and truth, spirit and life. It is the privilege of all who\nbelieve in Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour to feed on the Word\nof God. The Holy Spirit\u2019s influence renders that Word, the Bible, an\nimmortal truth, which to the prayerful searcher gives spiritual sinew\nand muscle.\n\u201cSearch the scriptures,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cfor in them ye think ye\nhave eternal life: and they are they which testify of me\u201d (John 5:39).\nThose who dig beneath the surface discover the hidden gems of truth.\nThe Holy Spirit is present with the earnest searcher. Its illumination\nshines upon the Word, stamping the truth upon the mind with a new,\nfresh importance. The searcher is filled with a sense of peace and\njoy never before felt. The preciousness of truth is realized as never\nbefore. A new, heavenly light shines upon the Word, illuminating\nit as though every letter were tinged with gold. God Himself has\nspoken to the mind and heart, making the Word spirit and life.\nEvery true searcher of the Word lifts his heart to God, imploring\nthe aid of the Spirit. And he soon discovers that which carried him\nabove all the fictitious statements of the would-be teacher, whose\nweak, tottering theories are not sustained by the Word of the living\nGod. These theories were invented by men who had not learned the\n40 Selected Messages Book 2\nfirst great lesson, that God\u2019s Spirit and life are in His Word. If they\nhad received in the heart the eternal element contained in the Word\nof God, they would see how tame and expressionless are all efforts\nto get something new to create a sensation. They need to learn the\nvery first principles of the Word of God; they would then have the\nword of life for the people, who will soon distinguish the chaff from\nthe wheat, for Jesus left His promise with His disciples.\u2014Letter\n132, 1900.\nChapter 4\u2014Warnings Against Deceptive Claims of [40]\nthe Spirit\u2019s Guidance\n[On November 12, 1908, there came to St. Helena, California,\na zealous man, with his wife. They sought an interview with Mrs.\nWhite, and related to her remarkable experiences dating back for\nabout three years. These experiences began to come to them after\nseveral days of fasting and praying for the Holy Spirit until, as they\nsaid, \u201cgreat drops of sweat stood on our brow.\u201d They believed that\nthey had received the Holy Spirit as did the early apostles. They\nclaimed to have spoken in tongues, and to have labored zealously\nfor others that they might enter into a similar experience.\nThey had been arrested in the east on a charge of exercising\nmesmeric influence on a child. After hearing the case the attorney\nand the mayor had said that if they were not on the border of insanity,\nthey were perilously close to it. They claimed that while in the jail\nthey were told \u201cthrough the Spirit\u201d to act as though they were insane,\nwith the result that God \u201cput the fear on these men, so they were\nfearful to come inside\u201d the cell.\nThey believed that the child whom they were charged with mes-\nmerizing was gifted with the Spirit of Prophecy, and directed them\nwhere to go. They claimed that through prayer they had healed the\nsick, cast out devils, and had done many other wonderful works. Of\nthis wife, the husband said, \u201cThe Spirit operates through her, and\nwe believe that this is the gift of prophecy that is to be poured out\non all flesh.\u201d\nThe following statements were made by Mrs. White in reference\nto this and similar movements.\u2014Compilers.]\nGod\u2019s Work Characterized by Calmness and Dignity [41]\nTwo weeks ago today, while I was writing, my son W. C. White\ncame into my room and stated that there were two persons below\nwho wished to speak with me. I went downstairs into our sitting\n41\n42 Selected Messages Book 2\nroom and there met a man and his wife who claim to follow the\nWord of God and to believe the Testimonies. They have had an\nunusual experience during the past two or three years. They seemed\nto be honesthearted people.\nI listened while they related some of their experiences, and then\nI told them something of the work we had to do in meeting and\nopposing fanaticism soon after the passing of the time when we\nexpected to see our Lord. During those trying days some of our\nmost precious believers were led into fanaticism. I said further that\nbefore the end we would see strange manifestations by those who\nprofessed to be led by the Holy Spirit. There are those who will\ntreat as something of great importance these peculiar manifestations,\nwhich are not of God, but which are calculated to divert the minds\nof many away from the teachings of the Word.\nIn this stage of our history we must be very careful to guard\nagainst everything that savors of fanaticism and disorder. We must\nguard against all peculiar exercises that would be likely to stir up\nthe minds of unbelievers, and lead them to think that as a people we\nare led by impulse, and delight in noise and confusion accompanied\nby eccentricities of action. In the last days the enemy of present\ntruth will bring in manifestations that are not in harmony with the\nworkings of the Spirit, but are calculated to lead astray those who\nstand ready to take up with something new and strange.\nI told this brother and his wife that the experience through which\nI passed in my youth, shortly after the passing of the time in 1844,\nhad led me to be very, very cautious about accepting anything similar\nto that which we then met and rebuked in the name of the Lord.\nNo greater harm could be done to the work of God at this time[42]\nthan for us to allow a spirit of fanaticism to come into our churches,\naccompanied by strange workings which are incorrectly supposed\nto be operations of the Spirit of God.\nAs this brother and his wife outlined their experiences, which\nthey claim have come to them as the result of receiving the Holy\nGhost with apostolic power, it seemed to be a facsimile of that which\nwe were called to meet and correct in our early experience.\nToward the close of our interview Brother L proposed that we\nunite in prayer, with the thought that possibly while in prayer his\nwife would be exercised as they had described to me, and that then\nWarnings Against Deceptive Claims of the Spirit\u2019s Guidance 43\nI might be able to discern whether this was of the Lord or not. To\nthis I could not consent, because I have been instructed that when\none offers to exhibit these peculiar manifestations, this is a decided\nevidence that it is not the work of God.\nWe must not permit these experiences to lead us to feel discour-\naged. Such experiences will come to us from time to time. Let\nus give no place to strange exercisings, which really take the mind\naway from the deep movings of the Holy Spirit. God\u2019s work is\never characterized by calmness and dignity. We cannot afford to\nsanction anything that would bring in confusion and weaken our zeal\nin regard to the great work that God has given us to do in the world\nto prepare for the second coming of Christ.\u2014Letter 338, 1908.\nStatements by Mrs. White in the Interview\nI am telling you these experiences, in order that you may know\nwhat we have passed through.... Some [fanatics after 1844] would\ndance up and down, singing, \u201cGlory, glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.\u201d\nSometimes I would sit still until they got through, and then I would\nrise and say, \u201cThis is not the way the Lord works. He does not make\nimpressions in this way. We must direct the minds of the people to\nthe Word as the foundation of our faith.\u201d\nI was but a mere child at that time, and yet I had to bear my [43]\ntestimony repeatedly against these strange workings. And ever since\nthat time I have sought to be very, very careful lest something of\nthis sort should come in again among our people. Any manifestation\nof fanaticism takes the mind away from the evidence of truth\u2014the\nWord itself.\nYou might take a consistent course, but those who would be\ninfluenced by you might take a very inconsistent course, and, as\na result, we should very soon have our hands full of something\nthat would make it almost impossible to give unbelievers the right\nimpression of our message and work. We must go to the people with\nthe solid Word of God; and when they receive that Word, the Holy\nSpirit may come, but it always comes, as I have stated before, in\na way that commends itself to the judgment of the people. In our\nspeaking, our singing, and in all our spiritual exercises, we are to\n44 Selected Messages Book 2\nreveal that calmness and dignity and godly fear that actuates every\ntrue child of God.\nThere is constant danger of allowing something to come into our\nmidst that we may regard as the workings of the Holy Spirit, but that\nin reality is the fruit of a spirit of fanaticism. So long as we allow\nthe enemy of truth to lead us into a wrong way, we cannot hope to\nreach the honest in heart with the third angel\u2019s message. We are to\nbe sanctified through obedience to the truth. I am afraid of anything\nthat would have a tendency to turn the mind away from the solid\nevidences of the truth as revealed in God\u2019s Word. I am afraid of it;\nI am afraid of it. We must bring our minds within the bounds of\nreason, lest the enemy so come in as to set everything in a disorderly\nway. There are persons of an excitable temperament who are easily\nled into fanaticism; and should we allow anything to come into our\nchurches that would lead such persons into error, we would soon\nsee these errors carried to extreme lengths, and then because of the\ncourse of these disorderly elements, a stigma would rest upon the\nwhole body of Seventh-day Adventists.\nFanaticism to be Seen Again[44]\nI have been studying how to get some of these early experiences\ninto print again, so that more of our people may be informed, for I\nhave long known that fanaticism will be manifest again, in different\nways. We are to strengthen our position by dwelling on the Word,\nand by avoiding all oddities and strange exercisings that some would\nbe very quick to catch up and practice. If we were to allow confu-\nsion to come into our ranks, we could not bind off our work as we\nshould....\nDuring the years of Christ\u2019s ministry on earth godly women\nassisted in the work that the Saviour and His disciples were carrying\nforward. If those who were opposing this work could have found\nanything out of the regular order in the conduct of these women, it\nwould have closed the work at once. But while women were laboring\nwith Christ and the apostles, the entire work was conducted on so\nhigh a plane as to be above the shadow of a suspicion. No occasion\nfor any accusation could be found. The minds of all were directed\nWarnings Against Deceptive Claims of the Spirit\u2019s Guidance 45\nto the Scriptures, rather than individuals. The truth was proclaimed\nintelligently, and so plainly that all could understand.\nHow afraid I am to have anything of a fanatical nature brought\nin among our people. There are many, many who must be sanctified,\nbut they are to be sanctified through obedience to the message of\ntruth.. . .\nWe cannot allow excitable elements among us to display them-\nselves in a way that would destroy our influence with those whom\nwe wish to reach with the truth. It took us years to outlive the un-\nfavorable impression that unbelievers gained of Adventists through\ntheir knowledge of the strange and wicked workings of fanatical ele-\nments among us during the early years of our existence as a separate\npeople.\u2014Manuscript 115, 1908.\nCounsel to the Brother and His Wife\nDear Brother and Sister L,\nRecently, in visions of the night, there were opened before me\nsome matters that I must communicate to you. I have been shown [45]\nthat you are making some sad mistakes. In your study of the Scrip-\ntures and of the Testimonies you have come to wrong conclusions.\nThe Lord\u2019s work would be greatly misunderstood if you should con-\ntinue to labor as you have begun. You place a false interpretation\nupon the word of God and upon the printed Testimonies; and then\nyou seek to carry on a strange work in accordance with your concep-\ntion of their meaning. You have even supposed that power is given\nyou to cast out devils. Through your influence over the human mind\nmen and women are led to believe that they are possessed of devils,\nand that the Lord has appointed you as His agents for casting out\nthese evil spirits.\nYour wife, in speech, in song, and in strange exhibitions that\nare not in accordance with the genuine work of the Holy Spirit, is\nhelping to bring in a phase of fanaticism that would do great injury\nto the cause of God, if allowed any place in our churches.\nMy brother and sister, I have a message for you: you are starting\non a false supposition. There is much of self woven into your\nexhibitions. Satan will come in with bewitching power through\nthese exhibitions. It is high time that you call a halt. If God had\n46 Selected Messages Book 2\ngiven you a special message for His people, you would walk and\nwork in all humility\u2014not as if you were on the stage of a theater,\nbut in the meekness of a follower of the lowly Jesus of Nazareth.\nYou would carry an influence altogether different from that which\nyou have been carrying....\nThe sincere desire to do others good will lead the Christian\nworker to put away all thought of bringing into the message of\npresent truth any strange teachings leading men and women into\nfanaticism. At this period of the world\u2019s history we must exercise\nthe greatest of care in this respect.\nSome of the phases of experience through which you are passing\nendanger not only your own souls but the souls of many others,\nbecause you appeal to the precious words of Christ as recorded in\nthe Scriptures, and to the Testimonies, to vouch for the genuineness\nof your message. In supposing that the precious Word, which is[46]\nverity and truth, and the Testimonies that the Lord has given for\nHis people, are your authority, you are deceived. You are moved by\nwrong impulses, and are bracing up yourselves with declarations\nthat mislead. You attempt to make the truth of God sustain false\nsentiments and incorrect actions that are inconsistent and fanatical.\nThis makes tenfold, yes, twentyfold harder the work of the church in\nacquainting the people with the truths of the third angel\u2019s message.\u2014\nLetter 358a, 1908.\nA Message to the Churches in California\nTo Our Brethren in California,\nLast night instruction was given me for our people. I seemed\nto be in a meeting where representations were being made of the\nstrange work of Brother L and wife. I was instructed that it was a\nwork similar to that which was carried on in _____, in the State of\nMaine, and in various other places after the passing of the time in\n1844. I was bidden to speak decidedly against this fanatical work.\nI was shown that it was not the Spirit of the Lord that was in-\nspiring Brother and Sister L, but the same spirit of fanaticism that\nis ever seeking entrance into the remnant church. Their application\nof Scripture of their peculiar exercises is Scripture misapplied. The\nwork of declaring persons possessed of the devil, and then praying\nWarnings Against Deceptive Claims of the Spirit\u2019s Guidance 47\nwith them and pretending to cast out the evil spirits, is fanaticism\nwhich will bring into disrepute any church which sanctions such\nwork.\nI was shown that we must give no encouragement to these demon-\nstrations, but must guard the people with a decided testimony against\nthat which would bring a stain upon the name of Seventh-day Ad-\nventists, and destroy the confidence of the people in the message of\ntruth which they must bear to the world. The Lord has done a great\nwork for His people in placing them on vantage ground. It is the\nduty of the church to cherish its influence. Precious are the words,\n\u201cSearch the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: [47]\nand they are they which testify of me\u201d (John 5:39). The words of\ninspiration carefully studied and prayerfully obeyed, will thoroughly\nfurnish unto all good works.\nAs a denomination we need to look more continually to God\nfor guidance. We are living in an evil age. The perils of the last\ndays are upon us. Because iniquity abounds, Satan presumes to\nbring in all kinds of delusive theories upon those who have tried to\nwalk humbly with God, and who are distrustful of self. Shall self-\nconfident, fanatical men come to these humble souls assuring them\nthat they are possessed of evil spirits, and after praying with them,\naffirm that the devil is cast out? Such are not the manifestations of\nthe Spirit of God, but of another spirit.\nI call upon every church to beware of being led to think evil of\nthose who, because distrustful of self, fear that they have not the\nHoly Spirit. There are those who have followed their own ways\ninstead of the ways of God. They have not acknowledged the light\nthat God has graciously given; and because of this they have lost the\npower to distinguish between darkness and light. There are many\nwho have heard much in regard to the path they ought to follow, but\nwho ignore the requirements God makes of them. Their light does\nnot shine in works that reveal the principles of truth and holiness. It\nis this class who in time of test will accept falsehood and erroneous\ntheories for the truth of God.\nGreat light has been given to the people of God. Let our people\nawake, and go forward to perfection. You will be exposed to the\nfallacies of satanic agencies. Fearful waves of fanaticism will come.\nBut God will deliver the people who will earnestly seek the Lord,\n48 Selected Messages Book 2\nand consecrate themselves to His service.\u2014Pacific Union Recorder,\nDecember 31, 1908.\nChapter 5\u2014Miracles Not a Test of God\u2019s Favor [48]\nSeek not for Miraculous Manifestations\nLet none cherish the idea that special providences or miraculous\nmanifestations are to be the proof of the genuineness of their work\nor of the ideas they advocate. If we keep these things before the\npeople, they will produce an evil effect, an unhealthful emotion. The\ngenuine working of the Holy Spirit on human hearts is promised, to\ngive efficiency through the Word. Christ has declared the Word to\nbe spirit and life. \u201cThe earth shall be filled with the knowledge of\nthe glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea\u201d (Habakkuk 2:14,",

But the light from the Word\nis shining amid the moral darkness; and the Bible will never be\nsuperseded by miraculous manifestations. The truth must be studied,\nit must be searched for as hidden treasure. Wonderful illuminations\nwill not be given aside from the Word, or to take the place of it.\nCling to the Word, receive the ingrafted Word, which will make men\nwise unto salvation. This is the meaning of the words of Christ in\nregard to eating His flesh and drinking His blood. And He says,\n\u201cThis is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, [49]\nand Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent\u201d (John 17:3).\nWe shall encounter false claims; false prophets will arise; there\nwill be false dreams and false visions; but preach the Word, be\nnot drawn away from the voice of God in His Word. Let nothing\ndivert the mind. The wonderful, the marvelous, will be represented\nand presented. Through satanic delusions, wonderful miracles, the\nclaims of human agents will be urged. Beware of all this.\nChrist has given warning, so that none need accept falsehood for\ntruth. The only channel through which the Spirit operates is that of\nthe truth.... Our faith and hope are founded, not in feeling, but in\nGod.\u2014Letter 12, 1894.\n49\n50 Selected Messages Book 2\nWhen the Miracle Worker Disregards God\u2019s Law\nWe must not trust the claims of men. They may, as Christ repre-\nsents, profess to work miracles in healing the sick. Is this marvelous,\nwhen just behind them stands the great deceiver, the miracle worker\nwho will yet bring down fire from heaven in the sight of men?\nNor can we trust impressions. The voice or spirit that says to\na man, You are under no obligation to obey the law of God; you\nare holy and sinless, while he is trampling on the divine law, is\nnot the voice of Jesus; for He declares: \u201cI have kept my Father\u2019s\ncommandments\u201d (John 15:10). And John testifies: \u201cHe that saith,\nI know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the\ntruth is not in him\u201d (1 John 2:4).\nThen how can these manifestations of great power, and these\nwonderful impressions, be accounted for, except on the ground that\nthey are given through the influence of that miracle-working spirit\nthat has gone forth to deceive the whole world, and infatuate them\nwith strong delusion that they shall believe a lie? He is pleased\nwhen men and women claim to possess great spiritual power, and\nyet disregard the law of God, because through their disobedience\nthey mislead others, and he can use them as effective agents in his\nwork.\u2014The Signs of the Times, July 21, 1887.\nNone Need be Deceived[50]\nEvery one of us will be sorely tempted; our faith will be tried to\nthe uttermost. We must have a living connection with God; we must\nbe partakers of the divine nature; then we shall not be deceived by\nthe devices of the enemy, and shall escape the corruption that is in\nthe world through lust.\nWe need to be anchored in Christ, rooted and grounded in the\nfaith. Satan works through agents. He selects those who have\nnot been drinking of the living waters, whose souls are athirst for\nsomething new and strange, and who are ever ready to drink at any\nfountain that may present itself. V oices will be heard, saying, \u201cLo,\nhere is Christ,\u201d or \u201cLo, there\u201d; but we must believe them not. We\nhave unmistakable evidence of the voice of the True Shepherd, and\nHe is calling upon us to follow Him. He says, \u201cI have kept my\nMiracles Not a Test of God\u2019s Favor 51\nFather\u2019s commandments.\u201d He leads His sheep in the path of humble\nobedience to the law of God, but He never encourages them in the\ntransgression of that law.\n\u201cThe voice of a stranger\u201d is the voice of one who neither respects\nnor obeys God\u2019s holy, just, and good law. Many make great preten-\nsions to holiness, and boast of the wonders they perform in healing\nthe sick, when they do not regard this great standard of righteousness.\nBut through whose power are these cures wrought? Are the eyes of\neither party opened to their transgressions of the law? and do they\ntake their stand as humble, obedient children, ready to obey all of\nGod\u2019s requirements? John testifies of the professed children of God:\n\u201cHe that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a\nliar, and the truth is not in him\u201d (1 John 2:4).\nNone need be deceived. The law of God is as sacred as His\nthrone, and by it every man who cometh into the world is to be\njudged. There is no other standard by which to test character. \u201cIf\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in\nthem.\u201d Now, shall the case be decided according to the Word of God,\nor shall man\u2019s pretensions be credited? Christ says, \u201cBy their fruits\nye shall know them.\u201d If those through whom cures are performed, [51]\nare disposed, on account of these manifestations, to excuse their\nneglect of the law of God, and continue in disobedience, though they\nhave power to any and every extent, it does not follow that they have\nthe great power of God. On the contrary, it is the miracle-working\npower of the great deceiver. He is a transgressor of the moral law,\nand employs every device that he can master to blind men to its true\ncharacter. We are warned that in the last days he will work with\nsigns and lying wonders. And he will continue these wonders until\nthe close of probation, that he may point to them as evidence that he\nis an angel of light and not of darkness.\nBrethren, we must beware of the pretended holiness that permits\ntransgression of the law of God. Those cannot be sanctified who\ntrample that law under their feet, and judge themselves by a standard\nof their own devising.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 17,\n1885.\n52 Selected Messages Book 2\nWill Sweep in the Whole World\nWe are coming right upon the time when Satan is to work with\nall manner of bewitching influences, and those who are charmed\nwith them now, or give them the least countenance now, will be all\nready to be swept right in to act a part with the devil then. Evil angels\nare working all the time upon the hearts of men. Satan is working\nwith everyone who is not under the control of the Spirit of God. It is\nthe lying wonders of the devil that will take the world captive, and\nhe will cause fire to come down from heaven in the sight of men. He\nis to work miracles; and this wonderful, miracle-working power is\nto sweep in the whole world. It is now just beginning.\nI want to tell you another thing. The vials of God\u2019s wrath and\nthe sprinkling of them are already coming. What is the matter that\nwe do not discern it? It is because the light of truth does not affect\nthe heart. The Spirit of God is being withdrawn from the world.\nYou hear of calamities by land and by sea, and they are constantly\nincreasing. What is the matter? The Spirit of God is taken away\nfrom those who have the lives of men in their hands, and Satan[52]\nis coming in to control them, because they give themselves to his\ncontrol. Those who profess to be the children of God do not place\nthemselves under the guardianship of the heavenly angels, and as\nSatan is a destroyer, he works through those men and they make\nmistakes; and they will get drunk, and because of intemperance,\nmany times bring these terrible calamities upon us.\nAnd see the storms and tempests. Satan is working in the atmo-\nsphere; he is poisoning the atmosphere, and here we are dependent\nupon God for our lives\u2014our present and eternal life. And being\nin the position that we are, we need to be wide awake, wholly\ndevoted, wholly converted, wholly consecrated to God. But we\nseem to sit as though we were paralyzed. God of heaven, wake us\nup!\u2014Manuscript 1, 1890.\nMiracles not a Test\nThose who engage in the work of God\u2019s cause today will meet\njust such trials as Paul endured in his work. By the same boastful\nand deceptive work Satan will seek to draw converts from the faith.\nMiracles Not a Test of God\u2019s Favor 53\nTheories will be brought in that it will not be wise for us to handle.\nSatan is a cunning worker, and he will bring in subtle fallacies to\ndarken and confuse the mind and root out the doctrines of salvation.\nThose who do not accept the Word of God just as it reads, will be\nsnared in his trap.\nToday we need to speak the truth with holy boldness. The testi-\nmony borne to the early church by the Lord\u2019s messenger, His people\nare to hear in this time: \u201cThough we, or an angel from heaven,\npreach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached\nunto you, let him be accursed\u201d (Galatians 1:8).\nThe man who makes the working of miracles the test of his faith\nwill find that Satan can, through a species of deceptions, perform\nwonders that will appear to be genuine miracles. It was this he\nhoped to make a test question with the Israelites at the time of their\ndeliverance from Egypt.\u2014Manuscript 43, 1907.\nWonderful Miracles Will Deceive [53]\nLet not the days pass by and precious opportunities be lost of\nseeking the Lord with all the heart and mind and soul. If we accept\nnot the truth in the love of it, we may be among the number who will\nsee the miracles wrought by Satan in these last days, and believe\nthem. Many strange things will appear as wonderful miracles, which\nshould be regarded as deceptions manufactured by the father of\nlies.\u2014Letter 136, 1906.\nHow Satan and His Agents Work\nI am instructed to say that in the future great watchfulness will\nbe needed. There is to be among God\u2019s people no spiritual stupidity.\nEvil spirits are actively engaged in seeking to control the minds\nof human beings. Men are binding up in bundles, ready to be\nconsumed by the fires of the last days. Those who discard Christ and\nHis righteousness will accept the sophistry that is flooding the world.\nChristians are to be sober and vigilant, steadfastly resisting their\nadversary the devil, who is going about as a roaring lion, seeking\nwhom he may devour. Men under the influence of evil spirits will\nwork miracles. They will make people sick by casting their spell\n54 Selected Messages Book 2\nupon them, and will then remove the spell, leading others to say that\nthose who were sick have been miraculously healed. This Satan has\ndone again and again.\u2014Letter 259, 1903.\nWe need not be deceived. Wonderful scenes, with which Satan\nwill be closely connected, will soon take place. God\u2019s Word declares\nthat Satan will work miracles. He will make people sick, and then\nwill suddenly remove from them his satanic power. They will then\nbe regarded as healed. These works of apparent healing will bring\nSeventh-day Adventists to the test. Many who have had great light\nwill fail to walk in the light, because they have not become one with\nChrist.\u2014Letter 57, 1904.\nEllen G. White Worked No Miracles\nSome declare their unbelief in the work that the Lord has given\nme to do because, as they say, \u201cMrs. E. G. White works no miracles.\u201d[54]\nBut those who look for miracles as a sign of divine guidance are in\ngrave danger of deception. It is stated in the Word that the enemy\nwill work through his agents who have departed from the faith, and\nthey will seemingly work miracles, even to the bringing down of\nfire out of heaven in the sight of men. By means of \u201clying wonders\u201d\nSatan would deceive, if possible, the very elect.\nMultitudes have heard me speak, and have read my writings, but\nno one has ever heard me claim to work miracles. I have at times\nbeen called upon to pray for the sick, and the word of the Lord has\nbeen verified. [James 5:14, 15 quoted.] Christ is the great miracle\nworker. To Him be all the glory.\u2014Letter 410, 1907.\nWhy Miracles are Less Important Today\nThe way in which Christ worked was to preach the Word, and to\nrelieve suffering by miraculous works of healing. But I am instructed\nthat we cannot now work in this way, for Satan will exercise his\npower by working miracles. God\u2019s servants today could not work\nby means of miracles, because spurious works of healing, claiming\nto be divine, will be wrought.\nFor this reason the Lord has marked out a way in which His\npeople are to carry forward a work of physical healing, combined\nMiracles Not a Test of God\u2019s Favor 55\nwith the teaching of the Word. Sanitariums are to be established,\nand with these institutions are to be connected workers who will\ncarry forward genuine medical missionary work. Thus a guarding\ninfluence is thrown around those who come to the sanitariums for\ntreatment.\nThis is the provision the Lord has made whereby gospel medical\nmissionary work is to be done for many souls.\u2014Letter 53, 1904.\nMiracles in the Closing Conflict\nIt is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people\nof God who will be alive on the earth when past woes and celestial\nglory will be blended. They will walk in the light proceeding from\nthe throne of God. By the means of the angels there will be constant [55]\ncommunication between heaven and earth. And Satan, surrounded\nby evil angels, and claiming to be God, will work miracles of all\nkinds to deceive, if possible, the very elect. God\u2019s people will not\nfind their safety in working miracles, for Satan would counterfeit\nany miracle that might be worked. God\u2019s tried and tested people will\nfind their power in the sign spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18. They are\nto take their stand on the living Word\u2014\u201cIt is written.\u201d This is the\nonly foundation upon which they can stand securely. Those who\nhave broken their covenant with God will in that day be without\nhope and without God in the world.\nThe worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their\nregard for the fourth commandment\u2014since this is the sign of His\ncreative power and the witness to His claim upon man\u2019s reverence\nand homage. The wicked will be distinguished by their efforts to\ntear down the Creator\u2019s memorial, to exalt the institution of Rome.\nIn the issue of the contest all Christendom will be divided into two\ngreat classes\u2014those who keep the commandments of God and the\nfaith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image and\nreceive his mark. Although church and state will unite their power\nto compel \u201call, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond\u201d\n(Revelation 13:16), to receive the mark of the beast, yet the people\nof God will not receive it. The prophet of Patmos beholds \u201cthem\nthat had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and\nover his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of\n56 Selected Messages Book 2\nglass, having the harps of God\u201d (Revelation 15:2) and singing the\nsong of Moses and the Lamb.\nFearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit of war\nis stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in\nthe midst of the time of trouble that is coming\u2014a time of trouble\nsuch as has not been since there was a nation\u2014God\u2019s chosen people\nwill stand unmoved. Satan and his angels cannot destroy them, for\nangels that excel in strength will protect them.\u2014Letter 119, 1904.\nChapter 6\u2014Our Safety Against Delusions [56]\nSincerity Alone Will Not Save\nFaith in a lie will not have a sanctifying influence upon the life\nor character. No error is truth, or can be made truth by repetition, or\nby faith in it. Sincerity will never save a soul from the consequences\nof believing an error. Without sincerity there is no true religion,\nbut sincerity in a false religion will never save a man. I may be\nperfectly sincere in following a wrong road, but that will not make it\nthe right road, or bring me to the place I wished to reach. The Lord\ndoes not want us to have a blind credulity, and call that the faith that\nsanctifies. The truth is the principle that sanctifies, and therefore\nit becomes us to know what is truth. We must compare spiritual\nthings with spiritual. We must prove all things, but hold fast only\nthat which is good, that which bears the divine credentials, which\nlays before us the true motives and principles which should prompt\nus to action.\u2014Letter 12, 1890.\nAn Outward Transformation of Character\nAs long as individuals are content with a theory of truth, and are\nyet lacking in the daily operation of the Spirit of God upon the heart,\nwhich is manifested in outward transformation of character, they are\ncutting themselves off from the qualification that would fit them for [57]\ngreater efficiency in the Master\u2019s work. Those who are devoid of the\nHoly Spirit cannot be faithful watchmen upon the walls of Zion; for\nthey are blind to the work that ought to be done, and do not give the\ntrumpet a certain sound.\nThe baptism of the Holy Ghost as on the day of Pentecost will\nlead to a revival of true religion and to the performance of many\nwonderful works. Heavenly intelligences will come among us, and\nmen will speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Spirit of God.\nBut should the Lord work upon men as He did on and after the day\nof Pentecost, many who now claim to believe the truth would know\n57\n58 Selected Messages Book 2\nso very little of the operation of the Holy Spirit that they would cry,\n\u201cBeware of fanaticism.\u201d They would say of those who were filled\nwith the Spirit, \u201cThese men are full of new wine.\u201d\nThe time is not far off now when men will want a much closer\nrelation to Christ, a much closer union with His Holy Spirit, than\never they have had, or will have, unless they give up their will and\ntheir way, and submit to God\u2019s will and God\u2019s way. The great sin of\nthose who profess to be Christians is that they do not open the heart\nto receive the Holy Spirit. When souls long after Christ, and seek to\nbecome one with Him, then those who are content with the form of\ngodliness, exclaim \u201cBe careful, do not go to extremes.\u201d When the\nangels of heaven come among us, and work through human agents,\nthere will be solid, substantial conversions, after the order of the\nconversions after the day of Pentecost.\nNow brethren, be careful and do not go into or try to create\nhuman excitement. But while we should be careful not to go into\nhuman excitement, we should not be among those who will raise\ninquiries and cherish doubts in reference to the work of the Spirit of\nGod; for there will be those who will question and criticize when\nthe Spirit of God takes possession of men and women, because their\nown hearts are not moved, but are cold and unimpressible.\u2014Letter\n27, 1894.\nNeed for Understanding the Doctrine[58]\nRebellion and apostasy are in the very air we breathe. We shall\nbe affected by it unless we by faith hang our helpless souls upon\nChrist. If men are so easily misled, how will they stand when Satan\nshall personate Christ, and work miracles? Who will be unmoved by\nhis misrepresentations, professing to be Christ when it is only Satan\nassuming the person of Christ, and apparently working the works of\nChrist? What will hold God\u2019s people from giving their allegiance to\nfalse christs? \u201cGo ye not after them\u201d (Luke 21:8).\nThe doctrines must be plainly understood. The men accepted to\nteach the truth must be anchored; then their vessel will hold against\nstorm and tempest, because the anchor holds them firmly. The\ndeceptions will increase.\u2014Letter 1, 1897.\nOur Safety Against Delusions 59\nSatan is now more earnestly engaged in playing the game of life\nfor souls than at any previous time; and unless we are constantly on\nour guard, he will establish in our hearts, pride, love of self, love of\nthe world, and many other evil traits. He will also use every possible\ndevice to unsettle our faith in God and in the truths of His Word. If\nwe have not a deep experience in the things of God, if we have not a\nthorough knowledge of His Word, we shall be beguiled to our ruin\nby the errors and sophistries of the enemy. False doctrines will sap\nthe foundations of many, because they have not learned to discern\ntruth from error. Our only safeguard against the wiles of Satan is to\nstudy the Scriptures diligently, to have an intelligent understanding\nof the reasons of our faith, and faithfully to perform every known\nduty. The indulgence of one known sin will cause weakness and\ndarkness, and subject us to fierce temptation.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, November 19, 1908.\nLook Constantly to Jesus\nUnder the showers of the latter rain the inventions of man, the\nhuman machinery, will at times be swept away, the boundary of\nman\u2019s authority will be as broken reeds, and the Holy Spirit will [59]\nspeak through the living, human agent, with convincing power. No\none then will watch to see if the sentences are well rounded off, if\nthe grammar is faultless. The living water will flow in God\u2019s own\nchannels.\nBut let us be careful now not to exalt men, their sayings, and\ndoings; and let not anyone consider it a grand point to have a startling\nexperience to relate; for here is a fruitful field where credence will\nbe given to unworthy persons. Young men and women will be lifted\nup, and will regard themselves as wonderfully favored, called to do\nsome great thing. There will be conversions many, after a peculiar\norder, but they will not bear the divine signature. Immorality will\ncome in, and extravagance, and many will make shipwreck of faith.\nOur only safety is in keeping fast hold of Jesus. Never are we to\nlose sight of Him. He says, \u201cWithout me ye can do nothing\u201d (John\n15:5). We must cultivate an abiding sense of our own inefficiency\nand helplessness and rely wholly on Jesus. This should keep us indi-\nvidually calm and steadfast in words and deportment. Excitement in\n60 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe speaker is not power but weakness. Earnestness and energy are\nessential in presenting Bible truth, the gospel, which is the power of\nGod unto salvation\nThere are quicksands upon which many are in danger of being\nswamped. It is always safe to seek for the earnest of the Spirit of\nGod, if we do not mingle with it a force and presumption that is not\nheaven born. There is need of caution in all our utterances lest some\npoor souls of ardent temperament shall work themselves up into a\nzeal not according to knowledge. They will act as though it was their\nprerogative to use the Holy Spirit instead of letting the Holy Spirit\nuse them, and mold and fashion them after the pattern of the divine.\nThere is danger of running ahead of Christ. We should honor the\nHoly Spirit by following where it shall lead. \u201cLean not unto thine\nown understanding\u201d (Proverbs 3:5). This is one danger of those who\nteach the truth to others. To follow where Christ leads is a safe path[60]\nfor our feet. His work will stand. Whatsoever God saith is truth.\nBut ministers who bear the last message of mercy to fallen men\nmust utter no random words; they must not open doors whereby\nSatan shall find access to human minds. It is not our work to ex-\nperiment, to study out something new and startling that will create\nexcitement. Satan is watching his chance to take advantage of any-\nthing of this order that he may bring in his deceiving elements. The\nHoly Spirit\u2019s moving upon the human agents will keep the mind\nwell balanced. There will not be a wrought-up excitement, to be\nfollowed by reaction.\nSatan will make use of every extravagant expression to the injury,\nnot only of the speaker, but of those who shall catch the same spirit\nand infuse others to their harm. Calmness and solemnity should be\ncultivated; the solemn truths we dwell upon will lead us to manifest\ndeep earnestness. How can we do otherwise when weighted with\nthe most sacred message to bear to perishing souls\u2014weighted by\nthe sense of the nearness of our Saviour\u2019s coming.\nIf we are constantly looking unto Jesus and receiving His Spirit,\nwe shall have clear eyesight. Then we shall discern the perils on\nevery side, and shall guard every word we utter, lest Satan find\nopportunity to weave in his deceptions. We do not want to have\nthe minds of the people wrought up into an excitement. We should\nnot encourage an expectation to see strange and wonderful things.\nOur Safety Against Delusions 61\nBut teach them to follow Jesus step by step. Preach Jesus Christ, in\nwhom our hope of eternal life is centered.\u2014Letter 102, 1894.\n62 Selected Messages Book 2\nSection 2\u2014Erroneous and Subversive [61]\n[62]Movements\nIntroduction\nThrough the years several erroneous or subversive movements,\nbased on misinterpretation of Scripture or supposed divine illumina-\ntion, have arisen among Seventh-day Adventists. These were firmly\nand squarely dealt with by the Spirit of Prophecy counsels given\nto meet these situations as they arose. Some of these counsels are\nincluded in this section.\nUsually closely linked with the supposed new light was a mes-\nsage of condemnation of the church and its leaders, and often there\nwas some phase of time setting. One such movement, known as\nthe Loud Cry of the Third Angel, led by a Mr. Stanton, was met\nthrough a series of articles published in 1893 in the Review and\nHerald under the title of \u201cThe Remnant Church Not Babylon\u201d (now\nfound in Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 23-53, and\nalso in The Remnant Church; Its Organization, Authority, Unity,\nand Triumph, 23-53). The materials drawn together in this section\nmake further reference to this movement and deal in considerable\ndetail with several like movements.\nTwo prominent cases involving claims to the prophetic gift are\nalso presented here in the form of counsel given by Mrs. White\nto those directly or indirectly concerned. She was in an extremely\ndelicate position in dealing with situations of this character, but in\nfulfilling her office as God\u2019s messenger, she was given instruction\nthat protected the church from these pretenders to the prophetic\noffice. She emphasized the point that the genuine manifestation of\nthe prophetic gift would bear its own credentials, accompanied by\nample clear, convincing evidence.\nAs long as there is an adversary to truth, subversive and erro-\nneous movements will arise and must be met. The Ellen G. White\ndepiction of several of these movements with their characteristic\nteachings, and the counsel given in analyzing the work and teach-\nings, offer much that may prove of great service in easily and clearly\nidentifying and meeting again such situations when they appear.\n64\nIntroduction 65\nWhite Trustees.\nChapter 7\u2014The Divine Credentials[63]\nDear Brother M,\n[Letter to one who had come to the conclusion that the Seventh-day\nAdventist Church had fallen into the low spiritual state described as\nBabylon.\u2014Compilers.]\nYour letter addressed to me was received at the beginning of the\nSabbath I should advise you to attend the school, and not to leave\nthis country until you become thoroughly settled in your mind as\nto what is truth. I sincerely hope that you will attend this term of\nschool and learn all you can in regard to this message of truth that is\nto go to the world.\nThe Lord has not given you a message to call the Seventh-day\nAdventists Babylon, and to call the people of God to come out of\nher. All the reasons you may present cannot have weight with me\non this subject, because the Lord has given me decided light that is\nopposed to such a message.\nI do not doubt your sincerity or honesty. I have written long\nletters at different times to those who were accusing the church\nof Seventh-day Adventists of being Babylon, that they were not\nhandling the truth. You think individuals have prejudiced my mind.\nIf I am in this state, I am not fitted to be entrusted with the work of\nGod. But this matter has been brought before my mind in other cases[64]\nwhere individuals have claimed to have messages for the Seventh-\nday Adventist Church, of a similar character, and the word has been\ngiven me, \u201cBelieve them not.\u201d \u201cI have not sent them, and yet they\nran.\u201d\nA Few Cases Recalled\nElder K, [See p. 96, also Selected Messages 1:176-184.] a dying\nman, had his room filled with interested people, while he was at the\nhospital at Battle Creek. Many were deceived. The man seemed to\n66\nDivine Credentials 67\nbe inspired. But the light that was given me was, \u201cThis work is not\nof God. Believe not the message.\u201d\nA few years since, a man named N, of Red Bluff, California,\ncame to me to deliver his message. He said it was the loud cry of the\nthird angel which was to lighten the earth with his glory. He thought\nGod had passed all the leading workers and given him the message.\nI attempted to show him that he was mistaken. He said Seventh-day\nAdventists were Babylon, and when we told him our reasons and set\nthe matter before him, that he was in error, he had great power come\nupon him, and he certainly gave a loud cry We had much trouble\nwith him; his mind became unbalanced, and he had to be placed in\nthe insane asylum.\nOne, Garmire, [See ch. 9.] advocated and published a message\nin regard to the loud cry of the third angel; he accused the church in\na similar manner to what you are now doing. He said the leaders in\nthe church would all fall through self-exaltation, and another class\nof humble men would come to the front, who would do wonderful\nthings. This man had daughters who claimed to have visions.\nThis delusion was opened to me. This is an intelligent man, of an\nacceptable address, and self-denying and full of zeal and earnestness,\nand carrying an appearance of consecration and devotion. But the\nword of God came from God to me, \u201cBelieve them not, I have not\nsent them!\u201d\nHe claimed to believe the testimonies. He claimed them to be [65]\ntrue, and used them in the same manner you have used them to give\nforce and appearance of truth to his claims. I told them this message\nwas not of God; but it was deceiving the unwary. He would not\nbe convinced. I told them the visions of his daughter [Anna] were\nspurious, yet these visions, he claimed, were like the visions of Sister\nWhite, testifying to the same things. This daughter was deceiving\nthe family and several others who believed these false messages. I\nwas shown that the young girl was not virtuous; but was corrupt\nIf ever a man that I looked upon was inspired, this man certainly\nwas; but I told him plainly his inspiration was of Satan, not of God.\nHis message bore not the divine credentials.\nIn order for him to give this message broadcast to the world, he\nmade an honest, conscientious young man believe it to be his duty\nto steal the Review and Herald list. This is a State-prison crime, and\n68 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe young man ran away from Battle Creek. He did not dare return\nto Battle Creek for some time. The time was set [by this fanatical\nteacher] for probation to close, and as every prediction failed, the\nyoung man saw he had been deceived, and he confessed his sin and\nis now an honorable member of the Battle Creek church.\nOnly two years since another man, by the name of O, from\nConnecticut, came out with a message which he called new light in\nregard to the message of the third angel. This intelligent family have,\nthrough this delusion, separated from the Seventh-day Adventist\nChurch. Because I had borne a decided testimony against this new\nlight, so-called, in _____, Connecticut, where he lived, he opposed\nme and my work and testimonies.\nThe father of the O children attended the Conference and Minis-\nters\u2019 Bible Institute held in Battle Creek; but he held himself aloof\nand did not harmonize with the spirit of the meeting. He left for his\nhome, and began to leaven the little church in _____. If I had not la-\nbored in that place they might have broken up the whole church with\ntheir repudiating the truth and position of Seventh-day Adventists,[66]\nand Mrs. White in particular.\nAt this same time, one, Mrs. P, came from Washington, D.C.,\nclaiming to be wholly sanctified and to have the power of healing.\nThis spirit led many to become bewildered. The same accusing spirit\nwas with them\u2014that is, that the church was all wrong and God was\ncalling out a people who would work miracles. A large class of our\npeople in Battle Creek were being severed. I was moved upon by\nthe Spirit of God, in the night season, to write to our people in Battle\nCreek.\nThe Message to the Laodiceans\nGod is leading out a people. He has a chosen people, a church\non the earth, whom He has made the depositaries of His law. He\nhas committed to them sacred trust and eternal truth to be given to\nthe world. He would reprove and correct them. The message to\nthe Laodiceans is applicable to Seventh-day Adventists who have\nhad great light and have not walked in the light. It is those who\nhave made great profession, but have not kept in step with their\nLeader, that will be spewed out of His mouth unless they repent. The\nDivine Credentials 69\nmessage to pronounce the Seventh-Day Adventist Church Babylon,\nand call the people of God out of her, does not come from any\nheavenly messenger, or any human agent inspired by the Spirit of\nGod.\nThe True Witness says, \u201cI counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in\nthe fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest\nbe clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and\nanoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. As many as I\nlove, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent. Behold,\nI stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open\nthe door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with\nme. To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne,\neven as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his\nthrone\u201d (Revelation 3:18-21).\n\u201cI Rebuke and Chasten\u201d [67]\nJesus is coming in to give the individual members of the church\nthe richest blessings, if they will open the door to Him. He does\nnot once call them Babylon, nor ask them to come out. But He\nsays, \u201cAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten\u201d (with messages of\nreproof and warning) (Revelation 3:19). These reproofs I am not\nignorant of. I have given warnings because the Spirit of the Lord\nhas constrained me to do so, and have uttered reproofs because the\nLord has given me words of reproof. I have not shunned to declare\nthe whole counsel of God, which has been given me for the church.\nI will say in the fear and love of God, I know the Lord has\nthoughts of love and mercy to restore and heal them of all their\nbackslidings. He has a work for His church to do. They are not to\nbe pronounced Babylon, but to be as the salt of the earth, the light of\nthe world. They are to be the living messengers to proclaim a living\nmessage in these last days.\nBabylon of Revelation 18\n\u201cAnd after these things I saw another angel come down from\nheaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his\nglory. And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the\ngreat is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and\n70 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful\nbird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her\nfornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication\nwith her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through\nthe abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from\nheaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers\nof her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins\nhave reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.\nReward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double\naccording to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her\ndouble. How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously,[68]\nso much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit\na queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow. Therefore shall\nher plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and\nshe shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who\njudgeth her\u201d (Revelation 18:1-8).\nThe whole chapter shows that Babylon that has fallen is the\nchurches who will not receive the messages of warning the Lord has\ngiven in the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. They refused\nthe truth and accepted a lie. They refused the messages of truth. See\n2 Thessalonians 2:1-12. The message in the eighteenth chapter of\nRevelation is plain and clearly defined. \u201cFor all nations have drunk\nof the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth\nhave committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth\nare waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies\u201d (Verse 3).\nAnyone who reads this chapter need not be deceived.\nHow Satan would exult to have a message go broadcast that the\nonly people whom God has made the repositories of His law are\nthe ones to whom this message applies. The wine of Babylon is the\nexalting of the false and spurious sabbath above the Sabbath which\nthe Lord Jehovah hath blessed and sanctified for the use of man,\nalso [it is] the immortality of the soul. These kindred heresies, and\nthe rejection of the truth, convert the church into Babylon. Kings,\nmerchants, rulers, and religious teachers are all in corrupt harmony.\nDivine Credentials 71\nThe Church Not to Be Broken Up\nAgain I say, The Lord hath not spoken by any messenger who\ncalls the church that keeps the commandments of God, Babylon.\nTrue, there are tares with the wheat; but Christ said He would send\nHis angels to first gather the tares and bind them in bundles to burn\nthem, but gather the wheat into the garner. I know that the Lord\nloves His church. It is not to be disorganized or broken up into\nindependent atoms. There is not the least consistency in this; there [69]\nis not the least evidence that such a thing will be. Those who shall\nheed this false message and try to leaven others will be deceived\nand prepared to receive advanced delusions, and they will come to\nnought.\nThere is in some of the members of the church, pride, self-\nsufficiency, stubborn unbelief, and a refusing to yield their ideas,\nalthough evidence may be piled upon evidence which makes the\nmessage to the Laodicean church applicable. But that will not blot\nout the church that it will not exist. Let both tares and wheat grow\ntogether until the harvest. Then it is the angels that do the work of\nseparation.\nI warn the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be careful how you\nreceive every new notion and those who claim to have great light.\nThe character of their work seems to be to accuse and to tear down.\nMy brother, I would say to you, Be careful. Go not one step\nfarther in the path you have entered upon. Walk in the light \u201cwhile\nye have the light, lest darkness come upon you\u201d (John 12:35).\nYou complain of being treated coldly in Battle Creek. Did you\ngo with a humble spirit to those who are spiritual and say, \u201cWill you\nexamine the Scriptures with me? Shall we pray over this matter? I\nhave not the light, I want it; for error will never sanctify the soul.\u201d\nCan you be surprised that they would not give you all that confi-\ndence you might think they should, after the experience they have\npassed through? Should not the words of Christ have any weight?\n\u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing,\nbut inwardly they are ravening wolves\u201d (Matthew 7:15). \u201cLo here\nand lo there is Christ\u201d will be multiplied. Let the believers heed the\nvoice of the angel who has said to the church, \u201cPress together.\u201d In\nunity is your strength. Love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.\n72 Selected Messages Book 2\nGod hath a church, and Christ hath declared, \u201cThe gates of hell shall\nnot prevail against it\u201d (Matthew 16:18). The messengers the Lord\nsends bear the divine credentials. I have tender feelings toward you,\nbut come to the light, I beseech of you.\u2014Letter 16, 1893.\nThe Fruitage of an Underhanded Work[70]\nIt is essential that all shall know what atmosphere surrounds\ntheir own souls, whether they are in copartnership with the enemy of\nrighteousness, and unconsciously doing his work, or whether they\nare linked up with Christ, doing His work, and seeking to establish\nsouls more firmly in the truth.\nSatan would be pleased to have anyone and everyone become\nhis allies to weaken the confidence of brother in brother, and to sow\ndiscord among those who profess to believe the truth. Satan can\naccomplish his purposes most successfully through professed friends\nof Christ who are not walking and working in Christ\u2019s lines. Those\nwho in mind and heart are turning away from the Lord\u2019s special work\nfor this time, those who do not cooperate with Him in establishing\nsouls in the faith by leading them to heed His words of warning, are\ndoing the work of the enemy of Christ.\nIt is a most serious matter to go from house to house, and under\npretense of doing missionary work, cast in the seed of mistrust\nand suspicion. Each one speedily germinates, and there is created\na distrust of God\u2019s servants, who have His message to bear to the\npeople. When God speaks through His servants, the seed [of mistrust\nand suspicion] sown has developed into a root of bitterness. The\nword falls upon hearts that will not hear, on hearts that will not\nrespond. No earthly or heavenly power can find access to the soul.\nWho is accountable for these souls? Who shall eradicate that\npoisonous root of bitterness that has prevented them from receiving\nthe word of the Lord? A good sister or a brother planted the evil\nseed, but how can that one restore the soul thus imperiled? The\ntongue that should have been used to the glory of God in speaking\nwords of hope and faith and confidence in God\u2019s workmen has turned\naway a soul from Jesus Christ. Those who themselves despised the\nwords of Christ, and refused to hear His voice and to be converted,\nhave leavened other minds with the leaven of evil surmisings and[71]\nDivine Credentials 73\nevilspeaking.\nThis is the day of the Lord\u2019s preparation. We have no time now\nto talk unbelief and to gossip, no time now to do the devil\u2019s work.\nLet everyone beware of unsettling the faith of others by sowing\nseeds of envy, jealousy, disunion; for God hears the words, and\njudges, not by assertions, which are yea and nay, but by the fruit\none\u2019s course of action produces. \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them\u201d\n(Matthew 7:20). The seed sown will determine the character of the\nharvest.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 32a, 1896.\nConvincing Evidence Accompanies the Message Inspired by\nGod\nWhen the Lord gives a man a message, He gives with it some-\nthing whereby His people may know that the message is from Him.\nGod does not ask his people to believe everyone who comes to them\nwith a message.\nThe Lord sends warnings to His people, not to destroy them, but\nto correct their errors\nWe are living in perilous times. From the light I have, I know\nthat Satan is trying to bring in that which will make people think they\nhave a wonderful work to do. But when God gives a man a message,\nthat man, by his meekness and lowliness, will give evidence that\nGod is working through him. God lives and reigns, and He desires\nus to walk before Him in humility. He does not wish this man N to\nforce himself before a congregation....\nWe are not going to be interrupted in meeting after meeting by\nthose who claim they have a message to deliver. He who presses\nhimself forward into a place where he is not wanted is not doing\nthe work of God. We are to work like soldiers in an army. We\nare not to step out of the ranks, and begin to work on our own\naccount.\u2014Manuscript 30, 1901.\nChapter 8\u2014Meeting the Claims of False Prophets[72]\nWhat We May Expect\nI have been shown many who will claim to be especially taught\nof God, and will attempt to lead others, and from mistaken ideas of\nduty they will undertake a work that God has never laid upon them.\nConfusion will be the result. Let everyone seek God most earnestly\nfor himself that he may individually understand His will.\u2014Letter\n54, 1893.\nThere will be those who will claim to have visions. When God\ngives you clear evidence that the vision is from Him, you may\naccept it, but do not accept it on any other evidence; for people are\ngoing to be led more and more astray in foreign countries and in\nAmerica.\u2014The Review and Herald, May 25, 1905.\nThe Visions of a Misled Child\n[In communications about, or to, the Mr. Garmire referred to in\nchapter 7, is counsel and information which may serve in dealing\nwith those who claim to have special light.\u2014Compilers.]\nI am compelled to state that I have not had the least faith in Mr.\n[J. M.] Garmire or his work. The pamphlet that was issued last fall\nat the time of our Jackson camp meeting had not the least sanction\nof our people. They were sent broadcast by stealing the Review and\nHerald list.\nThe daughter of Mr. Garmire claims, or he claims for her, to have[73]\nvisions; but they bear not the stamp of God. They are of the same\ncharacter as many such things we have met in our experience\u2014a\ndelusion of Satan.\nI plainly stated at the Jackson camp meeting to these fanatical\nparties that they were doing the work of the adversary of souls; they\nwere in darkness. They claimed to have great light that probation\nwould close in October, 1884.\n74\nMeeting the Claims of False Prophets 75\nI there stated in public that the Lord had been pleased to show\nme that there would be no definite time in the message given of God\nsince 1844; and that I knew that this message, which four or five\nwere engaged in advocating with great zeal, was heresy. The visions\nof this poor child were not of God. This light came not from heaven.\nTime was short; but the end was not yet. A great work was to be\naccomplished to prepare a people to be sealed with the seal of the\nliving God.\u2014An Exposure of Fanaticism and Wickedness, 9, 10,\n(Pamphlet) (1885).\nA Message to J. M. Garmire\nSatan has arranged things so that you should be ensnared. Fa-\nnaticism, deception, and strong delusion hold you captive. You have\ntalked your ideas in your family, misinterpreting scripture, wresting\nthe Word of God from its true interpretation, and have thus led them\nto believe that the views held and advocated by our people are not\ncorrect. Your interpretations of scripture are not in harmony with\nthe positions taken by Seventh-day Adventists.. . .\nThe mold you have given to your children\u2019s minds savors of\nthe errors that have corrupted your own mind. You have educated\nthem to see spots and stains in others, and to criticize them. By your\nwords and example in thus talking against your brethren and picking\nup their faults, you have set in motion a train of circumstances\nthat, through your own power combined with satanic agencies, has\nresulted in the visions of your daughter. All this fault-finding, this\naccusing of your brethren, is satanic....\nThe Divine Credentials [74]\nYour expressing so much faith in the testimonies, and making\nthem so prominent, is no help to me or my work, because you place\nthe false visions of your daughter on the same level with those the\nLord gives to me, and thus lower the sacredness and exalted character\nof the work God has given me to do.\nThe Lord has plainly shown me that what you regard as commu-\nnications from God to you and others through your child Anna, are\nnot from Him. They do not bear the divine credentials. It is another\nspirit that controls the child. It is the enemy that works in her. Such\n76 Selected Messages Book 2\nmanifestations will be more and more common in these last days.\nThey do not lead to unity, into all truth, but away from the truth.\nOne decided evidence we have that these exercises are not of\nGod, is that they concur with your views, which we know to be\nerroneous. Things she says she sees in vision are not sustained\nby the Word of God, but are contrary to it. Satan is constantly\nat work to imbue her with his own spirit, that through her, under\na cloak of righteousness, he may bring in commonness, heresies,\nand defilement. As you regard her utterances as from God, your\nfaith in the true testimonies is valueless; and thus Satan hopes to\ndisconnect you, and all who have any confidence in your ideas, from\nthe agencies that God has ordained, that you may be left to believe a\nlie. The Scriptures speak of those who are deceived and are being\ndeceived. This is your case. You deceive your daughter; she deceives\nyou\u2014the blind leading the blind. The enemy seeks to accomplish\nhis purposes by various means, as shall best meet the circumstances\nand situation of those whom he sees he can allure by temptation.\nI tell you plainly, the messages of your daughter Anna are not\nfrom God. This the Lord has shown me, and He will not lie. She\nmay say many good things, may speak much that is truth, but so does\nthe enemy of souls. The counterfeit will in many respects resemble[75]\nthe true. It is the fruit borne that testifies of the character.. . .\nHistory Repeated\nIn the work in which my husband and I were called by the\nprovidence of God to act a part, even from its very beginning in\n1843 and 1844, we have had the Lord to devise and plan for us, and\nHe has worked out His plans through His living agents. False paths\nhave been so often pointed out to us, and the true and safe paths\nso clearly defined in all the enterprises connected with the work\ngiven us to do, that I can say of a truth I am not ignorant of Satan\u2019s\ndevices, nor of the ways and works of God. We have had to tax\nevery power of mind, relying upon wisdom from God to guide us in\nour investigations, as we have had to review the different theories\nbrought to our attention, weighing their merits and defects in the light\nshining from the Word of God and the things God has revealed to\nme through His Word and the testimonies, in order that we might not\nMeeting the Claims of False Prophets 77\nbe deceived nor deceive others. We surrendered our will and way to\nGod, and most earnestly supplicated His aid; and we never sought in\nvain. Many years of painful experience in connection with the work\nof God have made me acquainted with all kinds of false movements.\nMany times I have been sent to different places with the message, \u201cI\nhave a work for you to do in that place; I will be with you.\u201d When\nthe occasion came, the Lord gave me a message for those who were\nhaving false dreams and visions, and in the strength of Christ I bore\nmy testimony at the Lord\u2019s bidding. The most terrible denunciations\nwere hurled against me, which they said were from the Lord, because\nI was opposing His work. They said that terrible calamities would\ncome upon me, just as your Anna has prophesied; but I passed along\nperfectly conscious of the guardianship of heavenly angels.\nDuring the past forty-five years, I have had to meet persons\nclaiming to have from God messages of reproof to others. This\nphase of religious fanaticism has sprung up again and again since\n1844. Satan has worked in many ways to establish error. Some [76]\nthings spoken in these visions came to pass; but many things\u2014in\nregard to the time of Christ\u2019s coming, the end of probation, and the\nevents to take place\u2014proved utterly false, as your prophesyings and\nAnna\u2019s have done. Yet they would try to excuse the blunders by\ntwisting the statements about, and giving them another meaning,\nand go on in the same way, deceiving and being deceived.\nWhen I was first wrought upon by the Spirit of the Lord, I was\nshown that I would be brought in contact with those who claimed to\nsee visions, but that the Lord would not permit me to be deceived.\nMy work was to unveil this falsehood, and to rebuke it in the name\nof the Lord. As the end drew near, I was to see more of these\nmanifestations.\n\u201cI Have Not Sent Them\u201d\nLetters have come to me from different ones, relating visions\nthat they said God had given them; but the Lord Jesus tells me,\n\u201cBelieve them not; I have not sent them.\u201d Some write to me, saying\nthat God has revealed to them that Sister White is in error, that she\nis influenced by the leaders to believe some things that are not true,\nand to reject some things that are true. But the word comes again,\n78 Selected Messages Book 2\n\u201cHeed them not; I have not spoken by them, nor given them any\nword or message. They have spun lying words, from the suggestions\nof Satan.\u201d\nSome have come to me claiming to be Christ, and have appar-\nently worked miracles. They have said that the Lord led me in many\nthings, but the Sabbath was not a test question; that the law of God\nwas not binding upon men; all we had to do was to accept Christ,\nand they themselves were Christ. I have had experience with all\nthese pretentious claims, and I have no faith in them. \u201cTo the law\nand to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is\nbecause there is no light in them\u201d (Isaiah 8:20).\nIn one place, four in one family professed to have communica-\ntions from the Lord, reproving wrong, and they predicted things that[77]\nactually did take place. This inspired confidence in them. But the\nthings that did not take place were kept in the dark, or were treated\nas something mysterious, which would be understood later. Whence\ndid these receive their inspiration?\u2014From satanic agencies, which\nare many. The Lord laid it upon me to meet these things, and bear a\ndecided testimony against them.. . .\nI have seen several fall in vision; but when I rebuked the spirit\nwhich controlled them, they immediately came out of vision, and\nwere in great distress of mind.\nCheap, Common, Earthly Matters\nSuch experiences as these came to be very common. Several in\none family were under this species of deception.... Messages would\nbe given for different members of the church, telling some poor\ntrembling soul, \u201cYou are proud\u201d; another, \u201cYou are unbelieving;\nyou will be lost.\u201d The Lord gave me light in this instance to speak\nwords of comfort and encouragement. I bore my testimony to those\ndeceived ones, whether they would hear, or reject it. Their visions\nwere Satan\u2019s work. The things revealed were often common, earthly\nmatters, such as, who should get breakfast the next morning, who\nshould prepare the dinner, who should wash the dishes. Mingled\nwith these frivolous things were sacred truths, which they had found\nin the Bible and testimonies. Satan\u2019s hand was in all this, to disgust\npeople, and cause them to spurn everything in the nature of visions.\nMeeting the Claims of False Prophets 79\nThus the false and the true would be rejected together. And even\nthose who were engaged in the deception, when they should become\nweary of it, would be inclined to doubt all visions.\nAfter a very solemn meeting with these deceived ones, confes-\nsions were made that they threw themselves into attitudes resembling\nSister White, as nearly as they could. It was all a farce, a deception.\nYet many things they told came to pass as they predicted.\nI was asked how this could be if the visions were all false. I\ntold them that it was Satan\u2019s purpose to mingle truth with error,\nthat through these deceptive exercises he might make of none effect [78]\nthe genuine work of God. From that time all their many visions\nceased. What has become of those who had the visions, and those\nwho encouraged them? Several now living are skeptics, have no\nbelief in the gifts of the church, no faith in the truth, no religion at\nall. Such, I have been shown, is the sure result of spurious visions.\nThe manifestations of your daughter are a similar deception. And\nyour encouraging these things in her will prove her ruin, and the\nruin of others, unless something breaks the deception. You called\nthese false visions and meaningless dreams the wonderful light of\nGod, but it is like the chaff to the wheat. This is a serious matter. It\nwill have a decided influence upon your family. While you regard\nyour daughter\u2019s words as spoken under the influence of the Spirit of\nGod, it will be the same to you as though they were true. You are\nunder strong delusion of Satan. You will claim to credit them, and\nthus your confidence in the veritable, genuine messages from God\nwill be uprooted. And so will it be with all who believe as you do.\nThis is why Satan is so constantly pressing in the spurious\u2014to lead\naway from the truth.\nThe very last deception of Satan will be to make of none effect\nthe testimony of the Spirit of God. \u201cWhere there is no vision,\nthe people perish\u201d (Proverbs 29:18). Satan will work ingeniously,\nin different ways and through different agencies, to unsettle the\nconfidence of God\u2019s remnant people in the true testimony. He will\nbring in spurious visions to mislead, and will mingle the false with\nthe true, and so disgust people that they will regard everything that\nbears the name of visions as a species of fanaticism; but honest souls,\nby contrasting false and true, will be enabled to distinguish between\nthem.. . .\n80 Selected Messages Book 2\nTake Heed How Ye Hear\nOh, how deceptive is the human heart! How easy it is to harmo-\nnize with that which is evil! There is nothing more detrimental to the\nsoul\u2019s interest, its purity, its true and holy conceptions of God, and of\nsacred and eternal things, than constantly giving heed to and exalting[79]\nthat which is not from God. It poisons the heart, and degrades the\nunderstanding. Pure truth can be traced to its divine Source, by\nits elevating, refining, sanctifying influence upon the character of\nthe receiver. The Author of all truth prayed to His Father, \u201cNeither\npray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me\nthrough their word; that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in\nme, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world\nmay believe that thou hast sent me\u201d (John 17:20, 21). Things will\nbe constantly arising to cause disunion, to draw away from the truth.\nThis questioning, criticizing, denouncing, passing judgment on oth-\ners, is not an evidence of the grace of Christ in the heart. It does\nnot produce unity. Such work has been carried on in the past by\npersons claiming to have wonderful light, when they were deep in\nsin. Heresy, dishonesty, and falsehood were all blended in them.\nThe present is a time of great peril to the people of God. God\nis leading out a people, not an individual here and there. He has a\nchurch on the earth, that abide in the truth; and when we see, not\nonly men, but young girls, crying out against the church, we are\nafraid of them. We know God has not sent them, yet they ran, and\nall who do not accept their erratic ideas are denounced as warring\nagainst the Spirit of the Lord. All such things are in Satan\u2019s line,\nbut the work of God will go forward while there are now and ever\nwill be those who work directly against the prayer of Christ. The\nwork will advance, leaving them with their satanic inventions far\nbehind....\n\u201cTake heed, therefore, how ye hear\u201d (Luke 8:18), is an admo-\nnition of Christ.

Did God give you that time\nmessage? No; for no such message comes from the true Source\nof light.... Time has proved you to be a false prophet, and Anna\u2019s\nvisions false exercises.

You\nwill claim, if you have not already done so, that you have a work to\ndo in connection with Anna\u2019s visions, corresponding to that of the\nmighty angel that came down from heaven, whose glory lightened\nthe earth.

You\nsay that Anna\u2019s visions place the forming of the image of the beast\nafter probation closes. This is not so. You claim to believe the\ntestimonies; let them set you right on this point. The Lord has\nshown me clearly that the image of the beast will be formed before\nprobation closes; for it is to be the great test for the people of God,\nby which their eternal destiny will be decided.\nYour position is such a jumble of inconsistencies that but few\nwill be deceived....\nYou have taken the history of the disobedient prophet, as given\nin the Old Testament, and applied it to Sister White. You say she\nis perfectly honest, but the deceived prophet. For this reason the\n81\n82 Selected Messages Book 2\ntestimonies of the Spirit of God can have no effect on you. Has the\nLord opened to you or your daughter, your wife or your children,\nthe disobedience of Sister White? If she has walked contrary to\nGod, will you show in what? My duty is to make plain statements\nof my position; for you misinterpret my testimony, wrench it from\nits true meaning, and ring in my name whenever you think it will\nenforce whatever you have to say. But when the testimonies do not\nharmonize with your theories, I am excused, because I am the false\nprophet! There are many ways of evading the truth.\nYou seem to have special bitterness against Elder [Uriah] Smith,\nand some others of our brethren, and you have talked out these\nfeelings in your family, thus leavening them. The Lord has seen\nfit to counsel Elder Smith, to give him words of reproof because\nhe had erred; but is this an evidence that God has forsaken him?\u2014\nNo. \u201cAs many as I love I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,\nand repent\u201d (Revelation 3:19). The Lord reproves wrongs in His\npeople, but is this an evidence that He has rejected them?\u2014No.\nThere are errors in the church, and the Lord points them out by His\nown ordained agencies, not always through the testimonies. Now\nshall we seize these reproofs and make capital of them, and say that\nGod is not imparting to them His light and love?\u2014No. The very\nwork that God is trying to do for them shows that He loves them,[82]\nand wants to draw them away from paths of danger.\nGod has spoken in reference to yourself. That which you term\nlight from heaven, He has pronounced darkness, and the visions born\nof this error, He calls a delusion. Will you believe this testimony?\nWill you heed what the Lord has spoken through Sister White, or\nwill you cast the word of the Lord behind you?

You say, \u201cThe Bible is my foundation of faith.\u201d But is\nit? I answer, The Bible does not sustain your position. Again you\nsay, \u201cShow me by the Bible that I am wrong, and I will give up my\nviews.\u201d But how can you be convinced by the Bible as long as you\nwrest and misapply its utterances? By so doing you cut off the only\nsource by which God might reach and convict you.\nThe only true way to search the Scriptures is to lay down every\nprejudice, every preconceived opinion, at the very door of investiga-\ntion, and then enter into the work with an eye single to the glory of\nGod, with an understanding open to conviction, and a heart softened\nto believe what the Lord says to you.\nThe opinions of men in regard to the interpretation of Scripture\nare many and varied; but the Scriptures are not changed to suit men\u2019s\nideas. The blessed Book is yea and amen; it remains firm, eternal.\nThe commentaries of men do not all agree, but the great and blessed [83]\nfacts remain the same. God\u2019s Word is immutable; \u201cit is written.\u201d\nYou have also taken from their connection portions of the testi-\nmonies which the Lord has given for the benefit of His people, and\nhave misapplied them to the support of your erroneous theories\u2014\nborrowing or stealing the light of Heaven to teach that which the\ntestimonies have no harmony with, and have ever condemned.

But you\nare not right with God, and God cannot administer to error. You\nmake the most of the errors you see in the responsible men of the\nchurch, and make capital of the reproofs given them, because these\nmen do not harmonize with you, or regard as correct the religious\nexperience which you hold as superior to the light God has let shine\nupon the church.

Satan is an artful foe, and he\nwill work where he is by many least expected. I have a message\nfor you. Did you suppose that God had commissioned you to take\nthe burden of presenting the visions of Anna Phillips, reading them\nin public, and uniting them with the testimonies the Lord has been\npleased to give me? No, the Lord has not laid upon you this burden.\nHe has not given you this work to do.... Do not belittle the work by\nmingling with it productions that you have no positive evidence are\nfrom the Lord of life and glory....\nMy dear brother, I wish to present before you some things con-[86]\ncerning the dangers that threaten the work at the present time. The\nwork of Anna Phillips does not bear the signature of Heaven. I know\nwhat I am talking about. In our first experience in the infancy of this\ncause we had to meet similar manifestations. Many such revelations\nwere given, and we had a most disagreeable work in meeting this el-\n86\nVisions of Anna Phillips 87\nement and giving it no place. Some things stated in these revelations\nwere fulfilled, and this led some to accept them as genuine....\nGod has not called Anna Phillips to follow on after the testi-\nmonies He has given to His people, and repeat their purport. But\nsuch her work is and has been. Persons did exactly the same thing in\nthe first experience in this cause. We had every phase of these false\nrevelations to meet.\nHow is it, my brother, that you have taken up these communica-\ntions, and presented them before the people, weaving them in with\nthe testimonies God has given Sister White? Where is your evidence\nthat these are of God? You cannot be too careful how you hear, how\nyou receive, how you believe. You cannot be too careful how you\ntalk of the gift of prophesying, and state that I have said this and that\nin reference to this matter. Such statements, I well know, encourage\nmen and women and children to imagine that they have special light\nin revelations from God, when they have not received such light.\nThis, I have been shown, would be one of Satan\u2019s masterpieces of\ndeception. You are giving to the work a mold which it will take\nprecious time and wearing soul labor to correct, to save the cause of\nGod from another spasm of fanaticism....\nMuch Good and Just a Little Seed of Error\nDo you not think I know something about these matters? All\nalong our pathway to the heavenly Canaan we see many souls that\nhave made shipwreck of faith, and in their false movements have led\nothers astray through the supposition that they were led of God in\nspecial revelations. I have had to write many, many pages to correct\nthese errors. I have been burdened and oppressed night after night, [87]\nunable to sleep because of the agony of my soul for God\u2019s heritage,\nHis people, who are in danger of being misled. Many things in these\nvisions and dreams seem to be all straight, a repetition of that which\nhas been in the field for many years; but soon they introduce a jot\nhere, a tittle of error there, just a little seed which takes root and\nflourishes, and many are defiled therewith.\nOh, I wish that we had far greater wisdom in all things than we\nnow have! One thing every worker in the vineyard of the Lord must\nlearn, that is, to practice the prayer of Christ, to move as one in\n88 Selected Messages Book 2\nChrist Jesus. Jesus prayed that His disciples might be one, as He\nis one with the Father. The enemy is at work, to divide, to scatter.\nNow as never before he will make determined efforts to scatter our\nforces. Above every other period it is unsafe now for us to move out\nin lines of our own. The truth for this time is broad in its outlines,\nfar reaching, embracing many doctrines; but these doctrines are not\ndetached items, which mean little; they are united by golden threads,\nforming a complete whole, with Christ as the living center. The\ntruths we present from the Bible are as firm and immovable as the\nthrone of God.\nMy brother, why should Elder R and yourself pursue the course\nyou have taken in regard to Anna Phillips without a greater certainty\nthat the Lord has chosen her as His mouthpiece to the people, His\nchannel through which to communicate light? If you accept every-\nthing of this order that shall come up purporting to be a revelation\nfrom God, if you continue to encourage these supposed prophets\nas you have done, giving the influence of your testimony to sustain\ntheir work, you will not be a safe keeper of the Lord\u2019s heritage.\nThe warnings Christ has given mean something to us. See Matthew\n24:21-23.\nSatan will work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness to\npersonate Jesus Christ; if it were possible, he would deceive the\nvery elect. Now if the counterfeit bears so close a resemblance to\nthe genuine, is it not essential to be on your guard, that no man\ndeceive you? Christ enforces His warnings, saying, \u201cBehold, I have\ntold you before\u201d (Matthew 24:25). Brethren, preach the Word, call[88]\nnot the people to rest their faith upon uncertain things or to place\nconfidence in the human agent. I have the word from the Lord. I\nwas shown Elder R before a number of persons reading from the\nprofessed revelations of Anna Phillips. A noble, dignified Person\nwas present, and with a grieved expression upon His countenance He\nremoved the written document, placed in Brother R\u2019s hand the Bible,\nand said, \u201cTake the Word of God as your textbook, \u2018All scripture\nis given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for\nreproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: that the man\nof God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works\u2019\u201d\n(2 Timothy 3:16, 17).\nVisions of Anna Phillips 89\nThose who search the Scriptures will find explicit instruction as\nto what God requires of them on points of practical religious life.\nYou are making a mistake in calling the attention of the flock of God\nfrom the Word, the unerring word of prophecy. Take heed what you\nhear, and be cautious what you receive. There is need of caution lest\nthe minds of the little flock shall be found accrediting that which is\nnot the genuine work of the Holy Spirit. There is very great danger\nhere. Satan is ever seeking to introduce spurious material into the\nwork, in order that he may mar the testimony, and bring discredit\nupon the truth. He would mingle with it an element that would be a\nstumbling block in the pathway of God\u2019s people.\nThe commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus is the\nmessage we have to bear to the world. The Word of God is not\none-sided, it is truth to be practiced. It is light extending on every\nside like the rays of the sun. It is light to lighten every man who\nwill read and understand and practice its teachings. \u201cIf any of you\nlack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him\u201d (James 1:5).\u2014Letter 103,\n1894.\n\u201cBelieve Them Not\u201d\nI have a message to you from the Lord. Brother R is not engaged\nin the work which the Lord would have him do. God has given to [89]\nevery man his work, and Brother R is stepping out of the lines to\nwhich the Lord has appointed him. He cannot see the outcome of\nthis work which he has taken up. Anna Phillips is being injured, she\nis led on, encouraged in a work which will not bear the test of God.\nAnna Garmire was thus injured. Her father and mother made\nher believe that her childish dreams were revelations from God.\nHer father talked to the child as one chosen of God; all her fancies\nand dreams were written down as Anna\u2019s visions. She had figures\nand symbols presented to her, and had reproofs for her mother and\nfor her father. After a scathing reproof, there followed the most\nflattering representations of the wonderful things the Lord would do\nfor them. These things I was pointed to as spurious, a deception.\nThey descended to the most minute and trifling matters, commingled\ncommon, cheap things with important subjects. The imagination\n90 Selected Messages Book 2\nwas largely developed, there was a mingling of the sacred and the\ncommon. The truth of God was belittled, and yet some received\nthese pretended revelations, and carried out their teaching. A little\nparty was formed who were apparently inspired by them, and the\nvisions were declared to be more spiritual than the visions of Sister\nWhite.. . .\nThe Mingling of the Sublime and the Ridiculous\nI have received from God the warning which I now send to you.\nAnna Phillips should not have been given the encouragement she has\nhad; it has been a great injury to her\u2014fastened her in a deception. I\nam sorry that any of our brethren and sisters are ready to take up with\nthese supposed revelations, and imagine they see in them the divine\ncredentials. These things are not of the right character to accomplish\nthe work essential for this time. Childish figures and illustrations\nare employed in describing sacred, heavenly things, and there is a\nmingling of the sublime and the ridiculous. While the work has an\nappearance of great sanctity, it is calculated to ensnare and mislead\nsouls.. . .\nVarious things will appear claiming to be revelations from God,[90]\nbut which flow from the imagination of a conceited and deceived\nmind. We had to meet these things in our early experience. There\nwere youth and children as well as those of mature age who claimed\nto be led and taught of God, having a special message to declare.\nThey were springing up on every side, having the truth on some\npoints, and error upon other points. For years the message from God\ncame to me, \u201cBelieve them not, for they lead into false paths. God\nhath not sent them.\u201d\u2014Letter 4, 1893.\nTest All So-Called Visions\nAs the report has been quite widely circulated that Sister White\nhas endorsed what has been written and circulated as revelations\nfrom God to Miss Anna Phillips, I feel that it is my duty to speak.\nI have not endorsed these productions. Warnings have been given\nto me in reference to them, that they will most certainly mislead.\nWoven in them will be statements that will lead to extremes, and to\nwrong actions on the part of those who accept them. It would be well\nVisions of Anna Phillips 91\nfor our brethren and sisters to move more cautiously, in accordance\nwith the light given them. They should test these so-called visions\nbefore accepting them, and presenting them in connection with the\nlight God has given me. I see that our people are in danger of\nmaking grave blunders and premature movements. God says of\nthese prophets that are springing up, \u201cI have not sent them, and yet\nthey ran. Believe them not.\u201d\nBut that which grieves me is that some of our brethren have\nassociated the exercise of Anna Phillips with the testimonies of\nSister White, and have presented the two to the people as one and\nthe same thing. Many have accepted the whole as proceeding from\nme. And when the result of such productions shall be seen in their\ntrue character, when falsehoods are presented as truths from God,\nand individuals act upon these things, believing them to be a message\nfrom the Lord, movements will be made that bear not the divine [91]\ncredentials, doubt will be cast upon the true work of the Spirit of\nprophecy. And the testimonies that God sends to the people will bear\nthe stigma of these false utterances. These revelations are largely a\nrepetition of that which has been before the people in publication\nfor years; and yet mingled with this are some things that will lead\nastray.. . .\nI have a warning to give to our brethren, that they shall follow\ntheir Leader and not run ahead of Christ. Let there be no haphazard\nwork in these times. Beware of making strong expressions which\nwill lead unbalanced minds to think that they have wonderful light\nfrom God. The one who bears a message to the people from God\nmust exercise perfect control. He should ever bear in mind that the\npath of presumption lies close beside the path of faith. In no case\nshould he make use of extravagant expressions, for a certain class\nare sure to be affected, and influences are set in motion that can no\nmore be controlled than can an impetuous horse. Once let impulse\nand emotion get the mastery over calm judgment, and there may\nbe altogether too much speed, even in traveling a right road. He\nwho travels too fast, will find it perilous in more ways than one. It\nmay not be long before he will branch off from the right road into a\nwrong path.\nNot once should feeling be allowed to get the mastery over\njudgment. There is danger of excess in that which is lawful, and that\n92 Selected Messages Book 2\nwhich is not lawful will surely lead into false paths. If there is not\ncareful, earnest, sensible work, solid as a rock, in the advancement\nof every idea and principle, and in every representation given, souls\nwill be ruined.... The greatest care should be exercised concerning\nthose who claim to receive revelations from God. There needs to\nbe much close watching and much praying. Those who are acting a\npart in the great work for these last days need to counsel together in\nregard to every new thing that shall be introduced, for no one man\u2019s\nmind is to be left to judge of, or to place before the public, important\nmatters which have a relation to the cause of God.\u2014Letter 6a, 1894.\nWithout Sufficient Evidence[92]\nI want to say just as little as possible in regard to Anna Phillips.\nThe less this matter is talked over and agitated, the better. There is a\n\u201cdead fly in the ointment.\u201d Before this reaches you, you will have\nreceived a letter giving a more complete statement in regard to what\nwe may expect in the case. I am more sorry than I can express to\nyou that the matter has been handled unwisely. We shall have scores\nof just such developments, and if our leading brethren shall catch\nup things of this character and endorse them as they have done in\nthis case, we shall have one of the most sweeping tidal waves of\nfanaticism that has been seen in our experience. There will be the\nwildest performances. Satan has already begun his work. To give\nready credence to these things, and make loose, unguarded state-\nments endorsing them without sufficient evidence of their genuine\ncharacter, is one of Satan\u2019s devices. The Lord Jesus has certainly\ngiven cautions sufficient in regard to this matter, so that none need\nbe deceived.\nIn such cases as these, it is essential that we let our moderation\nbe seen. The Lord is at hand. We cannot afford to work in such a\nway as those have done who have given the productions of Anna\nPhillips to our churches without clear and certain evidence that God\nis speaking to His people through her. For our ministers to rush a\nthing before the people as bearing the divine credentials, unless they\nknow for a surety that it is of God, will do a work that God has told\nthem not to do. Many things intended to deceive will come, bearing\nsome of the marks of truth. Just as soon as these shall be set forth as\nVisions of Anna Phillips 93\nthe great power of God, Satan is all ready to weave in that which he\nhas prepared to lead souls from the truth for this time.. . .\nError Bears Inscription of Truth\nEvery conceivable message is coming to counterfeit the work of\nGod, and always bearing the inscription of truth upon its banner.. . .\nIt is no light matter to substitute for God\u2019s revealed will, opinions [93]\nand assertions, dreams, symbols, and figures from human, finite\nbeings. Our actions, words, spirit, and influence are watched and\ncriticized. Those whom God has chosen to be His ministers are\nto settle solidly into His Word, and let the Word of God be their\nauthority.. . .\nAt this time above all others, hasty judgment, opinions formed\ncarelessly, without sufficient evidence, may lead to most disastrous\nresults. When we trace from cause to effect, we shall find that harm\nhas thus been done which in some cases can never be remedied.\nOh, what wisdom and fine spiritual perceptions are needed in giving\nfood to the flock of God, that it be pure provender, thoroughly\nwinnowed. The natural, hereditary traits of the character need a firm\ncurb, else earnest zeal, good purposes, will run into evil, and the\nexcess of feeling will produce such impressions upon human hearts\nthat they will be carried away by impulse and will allow impressions\nto become their guide.\nA curb must be kept upon the spiritual impulse, that no inju-\ndicious words shall be spoken, no overwrought ideas expressed,\nthat shall cause impulsive persons to lose their bearings. There are\nsome whose feelings are quickly stirred by strong assertions, and\ntheir imagination magnifies the statement to large dimensions; it\nall appears real to them, and they become fanatical. The spiritual\nexperience is fevered, diseased. When persons yield their will in\nperfect submission to the will of God, and the spirit is humble and\nteachable, the Lord will correct them by His Holy Spirit, and lead\nthem into safe paths.\u2014Letter 66, 1894.\n\u201cNothing Objectionable\u201d an Unsound Basis for Acceptance\nYou may be perplexed to know just what is the best course to\npursue in reference to the writings of Anna Phillips. I would suggest\n94 Selected Messages Book 2\nthat nothing should be done rashly. I feel very tenderly toward this\nsister. I would not say or do anything to harm her. And as the\nwritings have been so eagerly grasped and scattered broadcast with[94]\nso little test and proving, let there be no abrupt moves to call them\nin and destroy them as if they were poison. Where they have already\nbeen sent out with the sanction of our responsible men, let them\nremain. To make abrupt moves now would do harm.\nThe great wonder to me is that our brethren should accept these\nwritings because they could see nothing objectionable in them. Why\ndid they not consider what there is in them that is of a character to\nbe endorsed and sent forth with the power of influence which gives\nthem their force?\nThere are many things I shall not say now, which it will be\nnecessary to say hereafter. While I would do nothing to hurt this\nsister, I would not dare to keep silent.. . . I am placed in a peculiar\nposition, and this matter should never have been so treated as to\nmake it necessary for me to speak on such a subject. It hurts my\nheart to do it, and were it not that I see the future dangers, I would\nnot utter one word in regard to the matter, but would let it develop,\nand leave my brethren and sisters to pursue their own course in\nregard to these manifestations, which are not at all peculiar....I fail\nto see in the writings of Sister Phillips anything of a character that\nshould create such movements as have been made. And if things\nof this nature are to be so eagerly grasped, you will have plenty of\nthem, varied in some respects, yet such as you could treat with as\nmuch confidence. I am so sorry, so sorry.\nYou seem to think I should be able to point out just where the\nparticularly objectionable sentiments lie. There is nothing so very\napparent in that which has been written; you have been able to dis-\ncover nothing objectionable; but this is no reason for using these\nwritings as you have done. Your course in this matter is decidedly\nobjectionable. Is it necessary that you should discern at once some-\nthing that would produce harm to the people of God, to make you\ncautious? If nothing of this kind appears, is this a sufficient reason\nfor you to set your endorsement to these writings? ...\nDo not spread abroad writings of this character without more[95]\nconsideration and deep insight as to the after consequences of your\ncourse of action....\nVisions of Anna Phillips 95\nFanaticism will appear in the very midst of us. Deceptions will\ncome, and of such a character that if it were possible they would\nmislead the very elect. If marked inconsistencies and untruthful\nutterances were apparent in these manifestations, the words from\nthe lips of the Great Teacher would not be needed. It is because of\nthe many and varied dangers that would arise, that this warning is\ngiven. The reason why I hang out the danger signal is that through\nthe enlightenment of the Spirit of God I can see that which my\nbrethren do not discern. It may not be a positive necessity for me\nto point out all these peculiar phases of deception that they will\nneed to guard against. It is enough for me to tell you, Be on your\nguard; and as faithful sentinels keep the flock of God from accepting\nindiscriminately all that professes to be communicated to them from\nthe Lord.\nIf we work to create an excitement of feeling, we shall have\nall we want, and more than we can possibly know how to manage.\nCalmly and clearly \u201cpreach the word\u201d (2 Timothy 4:2). We must not\nregard it as our work to create an excitement. The Holy Spirit of God\nalone can create a healthy enthusiasm. Let God work, and let the\nhuman agent walk softly before Him, watching, waiting, praying,\nlooking unto Jesus every moment, led and controlled by the precious\nSpirit which is light and life.\nThe people want a sign, as in the days of Christ. Then the Lord\ntold them that no sign should be given them. The sign that should\nbe manifest now and always is the working of the Holy Spirit upon\nthe mind of the teacher, to make the Word as impressive as possible.\nThe Word of God is not a dead, dry theory, but spirit and life. Satan\nwould like nothing better than to call minds away from the Word,\nto look for and expect something outside of the Word to make them\nfeel. They should not have their attention called to dreams and\nvisions. If they would have eternal life, they must eat the flesh and\ndrink the blood of the Son of God.\u2014Letter 68, 1894.\nChapter 11\u2014To Be on Guard[96]\nIn God\u2019s Work All Is Quiet, Calm\nThe enemy is preparing to deceive the whole world by his mira-\ncle-working power. He will assume to personate the angels of light,\nto personate Jesus Christ. Everyone who teaches the truth for this\ntime is to preach the Word. Those who cling to the Word will not\nthrow open the doors for Satan by making unguarded statements\nin reference to prophesying or to dreams and visions. To a greater\nor less degree, false manifestations have been coming in, here and\nthere, since 1844, after the time when we looked for the second\ncoming of Christ. We have had them in the Garmire case, in the\nstatements of K, and in the Stanton movement. [See Testimonies to\nMinisters and Gospel Workers, 32 to 62.] We shall have them more\nand more, and like faithful sentinels we must be on guard. Letters\nare coming to me from many persons concerning visions which they\nhave had and feel it their duty to relate. May the Lord help His\nservants to be cautious.\nWhen the Lord has a genuine channel of light, there are always\nplenty of counterfeits. Satan will surely enter any door thrown open\nfor him. He will give messages of truth, mingling with the truth\nideas of his own, prepared to mislead souls, to draw the mind to\nhuman beings and their sayings, and prevent it from holding firmly [97]\nto a \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d In God\u2019s dealings with His people, all\nis quiet; with those who trust in Him, all is calm and unpretending.\nThere will be simple, true, earnest believers in the Bible, and there\nwill be doers of the Word as well as hearers. There will be sound,\nearnest, sensible waiting upon God. The believer will hang his\nhelpless soul on Jesus Christ. Christ will be exalted. Working and\npraying, watching and waiting, is our position.\u2014Letter 102, 1894.\nA Message to One Claiming to have Visions\n[Written from Washington, D.C., May 24, 1905.]\n96\nTo Be on Guard 97\nA question has been brought to me concerning the attitude that\nwe should take toward the work of a sister in Germany, who claims\nto have visions.\nThe word given me by the Lord during the past night is that God\ndoes not direct His people to look to this sister for counsel. If we\nshould encourage this sister in the work she thinks she is called to\ndo and in the messages she bears, much confusion would be caused.\nThe Lord has not given her the work of saying what this one shall\ndo, and what that one shall do. He says to His people, \u201cCome unto\nme, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\nTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly\nin heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,\nand my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30). \u201cIf any of you lack\nwisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith,\nnothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea\ndriven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he\nshall receive any thing of the Lord\u201d (James 1:5-7).\nTeach the people to seek God individually for guidance, to study\nthe Scriptures, and to counsel together, humbly, prayerfully, and\nwith living faith. But do not encourage this sister to think that the\nLord has given her messages for the people. The light given me\nregarding this case is that should this sister be encouraged to think [98]\nthat she has been given messages for others, the result would be\ndisastrous, and the sister would be in danger of losing her own soul.\nMy message to the sister is, Walk humbly with God, and look\nto Him for yourself. God has not given you the work of pointing\nout the duty of others; but you can be a helper if you are a sincere\nChristian, seeking to encourage others, and not claiming supernatural\nrevelations.\u2014Manuscript 64, 1905.\nTested by \u201cThe Law and the Testimony\u201d\nIn these days of delusion, every one who is established in the\ntruth will have to contend for the faith once delivered to the saints.\nEvery variety of error will be brought out in the mysterious working\nof Satan, which would, if it were possible, deceive the very elect,\nand turn them from the truth. There will be human wisdom to\n98 Selected Messages Book 2\nmeet\u2014the wisdom of learned men, who, as were the Pharisees, are\nteachers of the law of God, but do not obey the law themselves.\nThere will be human ignorance and folly to meet in disconnected\ntheories arrayed in new and fantastic dress\u2014theories that it will be\nall the more difficult to meet because there is no reason in them.\nThere will be false dreams and false visions, which have some\ntruth, but lead away from the original faith. The Lord has given men\na rule by which to detect them: \u201cTo the law and to the testimony: if\nthey speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light\nin them\u201d (Isaiah 8:20). If they belittle the law of God, if they pay no\nheed to His will as revealed in the testimonies of His Spirit, they are\ndeceivers. They are controlled by impulse and impressions, which\nthey believe to be from the Holy Spirit, and consider more reliable\nthan the Inspired Word. They claim that every thought and feeling is\nan impression of the Spirit; and when they are reasoned with out of\nthe Scriptures, they declare that they have something more reliable.\nBut while they think that they are led by the Spirit of God, they are[99]\nin reality following an imagination wrought upon by Satan.\u2014The\nBible Echo, September, 1886.\nTested \u201cBy their Fruits\u201d\nIn these days of peril we are not to accept everything that men\nbring to us as truth. As professed teachers from God come to us\ndeclaring that they have a message from God, it is proper to inquire\ncarefully, How do we know that this is truth? Jesus has told us that\n\u201cfalse prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many\u201d (Matthew 24:11).\nBut we need not be deceived; for the Word of God gives us a test\nwhereby we may know what is truth. The prophet says, \u201cTo the law\nand to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is\nbecause there is no light in them\u201d (Isaiah 8:20).\nFrom this statement it is evident that it becomes us to be diligent\nBible students, that we may know what is according to the law and\nthe testimony. We are safe in no other course of action. Jesus says,\n\u201cBeware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep\u2019s clothing,\nbut inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their\nfruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so\nevery good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth\nTo Be on Guard 99\nforth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither\ncan a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth\nnot forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire\u201d (Matthew\n7:15-19).\u2014The Review and Herald, February 23, 1892.\nVoluntary Exhibition Evidence Spurious Work\nAs this brother and his wife outlined their experiences, which\nthey claim have come to them as the result of receiving the Holy\nGhost with apostolic power, it seemed to be a facsimile of that which\nwe were called to meet and correct in our early experience.\nToward the close of our interview, Brother L proposed that we\nunite in prayer, with the thought that possibly while in prayer his\nwife would be exercised as they had described to me, and that then [100]\nI might be able to discern whether this was of the Lord or not. To\nthis I could not consent, because I have been instructed that when\none offers to exhibit these peculiar manifestations, this is a decided\nevidence that it is not the work of God.\u2014Letter 338, 1908.\nBible Not Superseded by Miracles\nLet none cherish the idea that special providences or miraculous\nmanifestations are to be the proof of the genuineness of their work\nor of the ideas they advocate. If we keep these things before the\npeople, they will produce an evil effect, an unhealthful emotion. The\ngenuine working of the Holy Spirit on human hearts is promised, to\ngive efficiency through the Word. Christ has declared the Word to\nbe spirit and life. \u201cThe earth shall be filled with the knowledge of\nthe glory of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea\u201d (Habakkuk 2:14,",

But the light from the Word\nis shining amid the moral darkness; and the Bible will never be\nsuperseded by miraculous manifestations. The truth must be studied,\nit must be searched for as hidden treasure. Wonderful illuminations\nwill not be given aside from the Word, or to take the place of it.\nCling to the Word, receive the ingrafted Word, which will make men\nwise unto salvation. [See fuller context on pages 48, 49.]\nChapter 12\u2014The Three Angels and the Other Angel[101]\n[Often in connection with erroneous teachings and false move-\nments, the one leading out identifies his message and work with that\nof the other angel of Revelation 18:1. Some erroneous teachings\nthrough the years have involved as well the messages of the three\nangels of Revelation 14. Such was the case in a situation met in 1896\nby Mrs. White in the communications which follow. The review of\nthe three angels\u2019 messages in their broad work, while lengthy, will\nbe treasured for its confirming statements.\u2014Compilers.]\nA Mixture of Truth and Error\nI have not been able to sleep since half past one o\u2019clock. I\nwas bearing to Brother T a message which the Lord had given me\nfor him. The peculiar views he holds are a mixture of truth and\nerror. If he had passed through the experiences of God\u2019s people\nas He has led them for the past forty years, he would be better\nprepared to make the correct application of Scripture. The great\nwaymarks of truth, showing us our bearings in prophetic history, are\nto be carefully guarded, lest they be torn down, and replaced with\ntheories that would bring confusion rather than genuine light. I have\nbeen cited to the very erroneous theories that have been presented\nover and over again. Those who advocated these theories presented\nScripture quotations, but they misapplied and misinterpreted them.\nThe theories supposed to be correct were incorrect, and yet many[102]\nthought them the very theories to be brought before the people. The\nprophecies of Daniel and John are to be diligently studied.\nThere are those now living who, in studying the prophecies of\nDaniel and John, received great light from God as they passed over\nthe ground where special prophecies were in process of fulfillment\nin their order. They bore the message of time to the people. The truth\nshone out clearly as the sun at noonday. Historical events, showing\nthe direct fulfillment of prophecy, were set before the people, and the\n100\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 101\nprophecy was seen to be a figurative delineation of events leading\ndown to the close of this earth\u2019s history. The scenes connected with\nthe working of the man of sin are the last features plainly revealed\nin this earth\u2019s history. The people now have a special message to\ngive to the world, the third angel\u2019s message. Those who, in their\nexperience, have passed over the ground, and acted a part in the\nproclamation of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages, are\nnot so liable to be led into false paths as are those who have not had\nan experimental knowledge of the people of God....\nThere have been one and another who in studying their Bibles\nthought they discovered great light, and new theories, but these have\nnot been correct. The Scripture is all true, but by misapplying the\nScripture men arrive at wrong conclusions. We are engaged in a\nmighty conflict, and it will become more close and determined, as\nwe near the final struggle. We have a sleepless adversary, and he is\nconstantly at work upon human minds that have not had a personal\nexperience in the teachings of the people of God for the past fifty\nyears. Some will take the truth applicable to their time, and place it\nin the future. Events in the train of prophecy that had their fulfillment\naway in the past are made future, and thus by these theories the faith\nof some is undermined.\nFrom the light that the Lord has been pleased to give me, you are\nin danger of doing the same work, presenting before others truths\nwhich have had their place and done their specific work for the time,\nin the history of the faith of the people of God. You recognize these [103]\nfacts in Bible history as true, but apply them to the future. They have\ntheir force still in their proper place, in the chain of events that have\nmade us as a people what we are today, and as such, they are to be\npresented to those who are in the darkness of error. The true workers\nof Jesus Christ are to cooperate with their brethren who have had\nan experience in the work from the very rise of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage. These followed on step by step, receiving light and truth\nas they advanced, bearing one test after another, lifting the cross\nthat lay directly in their pathway, and pressing on to know the Lord,\nwhose goings forth are prepared as the morning. You and other of\nour brethren must accept the truth as God has given it to His students\nof prophecy, as they have been led by genuine, living experience,\nadvancing point by point, tested, proved, and tried, until the truth\n102 Selected Messages Book 2\nis to them a reality. From their voices and pens the truth in bright,\nwarm rays has gone to all parts of the world, and that which was to\nthem testing truth, as brought by the Lord\u2019s delegated messengers,\nis testing truth to all to whom this message is proclaimed.\nThe burden of the warning now to come to the people of God,\nnigh and afar off, is the third angel\u2019s message. And those who are\nseeking to understand this message will not be led by the Lord to\nmake an application of the Word that will undermine the foundation\nand remove the pillars of the faith that has made Seventh-day Ad-\nventists what they are today. The truths that have been unfolding in\ntheir order, as we have advanced along the line of prophecy revealed\nin the Word of God, are truth, sacred, eternal truth today. Those who\npassed over the ground step by step in the past history of our expe-\nrience, seeing the chain of truth in the prophecies, were prepared\nto accept and obey every ray of light. They were praying, fasting,\nsearching, digging for the truth as for hidden treasures, and the Holy\nSpirit, we know, was teaching and guiding us. Many theories were\nadvanced, bearing a semblance of truth, but so mingled with misin-\nterpreted and misapplied scriptures, that they led to dangerous errors.[104]\nVery well do we know how every point of truth was established, and\nthe seal set upon it by the Holy Spirit of God. And all the time voices\nwere heard, \u201cHere is the truth,\u201d \u201cI have the truth; follow me.\u201d But\nthe warnings came, \u201cGo not ye after them. I have not sent them, but\nthey ran.\u201d (See Jeremiah 23:21.).\nThe leadings of the Lord were marked, and most wonderful were\nHis revelations of what is truth. Point after point was established\nby the Lord God of heaven. That which was truth then, is truth\ntoday. But the voices do not cease to be heard\u2014\u201cThis is truth. I have\nnew light.\u201d But these new lights in prophetic lines are manifest in\nmisapplying the Word and setting the people of God adrift without\nan anchor to hold them. If the student of the Word would take\nthe truths which God has revealed in the leadings of His people,\nand appropriate these truths, digest them, and bring them into their\npractical life, they would then be living channels of light. But those\nwho have set themselves to study out new theories, have a mixture\nof truth and error combined, and after trying to make these things\nprominent, have demonstrated that they have not kindled their taper\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 103\nfrom the divine altar, and it has gone out in darkness.\u2014Manuscript\n31, 1896.\nThe Three Angels\u2019 Messages in their Larger Setting\nThe proclamation of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages\nhas been located by the Word of Inspiration. Not a peg or pin is to\nbe removed. No human authority has any more right to change the\nlocation of these messages than to substitute the New Testament for\nthe Old. The Old Testament is the gospel in figures and symbols.\nThe New Testament is the substance. One is as essential as the other.\nThe Old Testament presents lessons from the lips of Christ, and\nthese lessons have not lost their force in any particular.\nThe first and second messages were given in 1843 and 1844, and\nwe are now under the proclamation of the third; but all three of the [105]\nmessages are still to be proclaimed. It is just as essential now as ever\nbefore that they shall be repeated to those who are seeking for the\ntruth. By pen and voice we are to sound the proclamation, showing\ntheir order, and the application of the prophecies that bring us to the\nthird angel\u2019s message. There cannot be a third without the first and\nsecond. These messages we are to give to the world in publications,\nin discourses, showing in the line of prophetic history the things that\nhave been and the things that will be.\nThe book that was sealed was not the book of Revelation, but\nthat portion of the prophecy of Daniel which related to the last days.\nThe Scripture says, \u201cBut thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal\nthe book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro,\nand knowledge shall be increased\u201d (Daniel 12:4). When the book\nwas opened, the proclamation was made, \u201cTime shall be no longer.\u201d\n(See Revelation 10:6.) The book of Daniel is now unsealed, and the\nrevelation made by Christ to John is to come to all the inhabitants of\nthe earth. By the increase of knowledge a people is to be prepared\nto stand in the latter days.\nThe Sabbath the Great Issue\n\u201cAnd I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the\neverlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and\nto every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with\n104 Selected Messages Book 2\na loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his\njudgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth,\nand the sea, and the fountains of waters\u201d (Revelation 14:6, 7).\nThis message, if heeded, will call the attention of every nation\nand kindred and tongue and people to a close examination of the\nWord, and to the true light in regard to the power that has changed\nthe seventh-day Sabbath to a spurious sabbath. The only true God\nhas been forsaken, His law has been discarded, His sacred Sabbath\ninstitution has been trampled in the dust by the man of sin. The\nfourth commandment, so plain and explicit, has been ignored. The[106]\nSabbath memorial, declaring who the living God is, the Creator\nof the heavens and the earth, has been torn down, and a spurious\nsabbath has been given to the world in its place. Thus a breach has\nbeen made in the law of God. A false sabbath could not be a true\nstandard.\nIn the first angel\u2019s message men are called upon to worship God,\nour Creator, who made the world and all things that are therein.\nThey have paid homage to an institution of the Papacy, making of no\neffect the law of Jehovah, but there is to be an increase of knowledge\non this subject.\nThe message proclaimed by the angel flying in the midst of\nheaven is the everlasting gospel, the same gospel that was declared\nin Eden when God said to the serpent, \u201cI will put enmity between\nthee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall\nbruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel\u201d (Genesis 3:15).\nHere was the first promise of a Saviour who would stand on the\nfield of battle to contest the power of Satan and prevail against him.\nChrist came to our world to represent the character of God as it\nis represented in His holy law; for His law is a transcript of His\ncharacter. Christ was both the law and the gospel. The angel that\nproclaims the everlasting gospel proclaims the law of God; for the\ngospel of salvation brings men to obedience of the law, whereby\ntheir characters are formed after the divine similitude.\nIn the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, the work of those who wor-\nship God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, is specified: \u201cThey\nthat shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise\nup the foundations of many generations\u201d (Isaiah 58:12). God\u2019s\nmemorial, His seventh-day Sabbath, will be uplifted. \u201cThou shalt\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 105\nbe called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell\nin. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath [no longer trample it\nunder your feet], from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call\nthe Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt\nhonour Him, I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the\nearth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the [107]\nmouth of the Lord hath spoken it\u201d (Isaiah 58:12-14).\nThe history of the church and the world, the loyal and the dis-\nloyal, is here plainly revealed. The loyal under the proclamation of\nthe third angel\u2019s message have turned their feet into the way of God\u2019s\ncommandments, to respect, to honor, and glorify Him who created\nthe heavens and the earth. The opposing forces have dishonored God\nby making a breach in His law, and when light from His Word has\ncalled attention to His holy commandments, revealing the breach\nmade in the law by the papal authority, then, to get rid of conviction,\nmen have tried to destroy the whole law. But could they destroy it?\nNo; for all who will search the Scriptures for themselves will see\nthat the law of God stands immutable, eternal, and His memorial,\nthe Sabbath, will endure through eternal ages, pointing to the only\ntrue God in distinction from all false gods.\nSatan has been persevering and untiring in his efforts to prosecute\nthe work he began in heaven, to change the law of God. He has\nsucceeded in making the world believe the theory he presented in\nheaven before his fall, that the law of God was faulty, and needed\nrevising. A large part of the professed Christian church, by their\nattitude, if not by their words, show that they have accepted the same\nerror. But if in one jot or tittle the law of God has been changed,\nSatan has gained on earth that which he could not gain in heaven. He\nhas prepared his delusive snare, hoping to take captive the church\nand the world. But not all will be taken in the snare. A line of\ndistinction is being drawn between the children of obedience and\nthe children of disobedience, the loyal and true and the disloyal and\nuntrue. Two great parties are developed, the worshipers of the beast\nand his image, and the worshipers of the true and living God.\n106 Selected Messages Book 2\nThe Angel of Revelation Ten\nThe message of Revelation 14, proclaiming that the hour of\nGod\u2019s judgment is come, is given in the time of the end; and the\nangel of Revelation 10 is represented as having one foot on the sea[108]\nand one foot on the land, showing that the message will be carried\nto distant lands, the ocean will be crossed, and the islands of the\nsea will hear the proclamation of the last message of warning to our\nworld.\n\u201cAnd the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the\nearth lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for\never and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are,\nand the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the\nthings which are therein, that there should be time no longer\u201d (Rev-\nelation 10:5, 6). This message announces the end of the prophetic\nperiods. The disappointment of those who expected to see our Lord\nin 1844 was indeed bitter to those who had so ardently looked for\nHis appearing. It was in the Lord\u2019s order that this disappointment\nshould come, and that hearts should be revealed.\nNot one cloud has fallen upon the church that God has not pre-\npared for; not one opposing force has risen to counterwork the work\nof God but He has foreseen. All has taken place as He has predicted\nthrough His prophets. He has not left His church in darkness, for-\nsaken, but has traced in prophetic declarations what would occur,\nand through His providence, acting in its appointed place in the\nworld\u2019s history, He has brought about that which His Holy Spirit in-\nspired the prophets to foretell. All His purposes will be fulfilled and\nestablished. His law is linked with His throne, and satanic agencies\ncombined with human agencies cannot destroy it. Truth is inspired\nand guarded by God; it will live, and will succeed, although it may\nappear at times to be overshadowed. The gospel of Christ is the\nlaw exemplified in character. The deceptions practiced against it,\nevery device for vindicating falsehood, every error forged by satanic\nagencies, will eventually be eternally broken, and the triumph of\ntruth will be like the appearing of the sun at noonday. The Sun of\nRighteousness shall shine forth with healing in His wings, and the\nwhole earth shall be filled with His glory.\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 107\nThe Certainty of Prophecy [109]\nAll that God has in prophetic history specified to be fulfilled in\nthe past has been, and all that is yet to come in its order will be.\nDaniel, God\u2019s prophet, stands in his place. John stands in his place.\nIn the Revelation the Lion of the tribe of Judah has opened to the\nstudents of prophecy the book of Daniel, and thus is Daniel standing\nin his place. He bears his testimony, that which the Lord revealed to\nhim in vision of the great and solemn events which we must know\nas we stand on the very threshold of their fulfillment.\nIn history and prophecy the Word of God portrays the long\ncontinued conflict between truth and error. That conflict is yet in\nprogress. Those things which have been, will be repeated. Old\ncontroversies will be revived, and new theories will be continually\narising. But God\u2019s people, who in their belief and fulfillment of\nprophecy have acted a part in the proclamation of the first, second,\nand third angels\u2019 messages, know where they stand. They have an\nexperience that is more precious than fine gold. They are to stand\nfirm as a rock, holding the beginning of their confidence steadfast\nunto the end.\nA transforming power attended the proclamation of the first and\nsecond angels\u2019 messages, as it attends the message of the third angel.\nLasting convictions were made upon human minds. The power of\nthe Holy Spirit was manifested. There was diligent study of the\nScriptures, point by point. Almost entire nights were devoted to\nearnest searching of the Word. We searched for the truth as for\nhidden treasures. The Lord revealed Himself to us. Light was shed\non the prophecies, and we knew that we received divine instruction....\nAfter the great disappointment there were few who set them-\nselves to seek the Word with all their heart. But some souls would not\nsettle down in discouragement and deny that the Lord had led them.\nTo these the truth was opened point by point, and entwined with\ntheir most hallowed recollections and sympathies. The searchers\nafter truth felt that the identification of Christ with their nature and [110]\ninterest was complete. Truth was made to shine forth, beautiful in\nits simplicity, dignified with a power and invested with an assurance\nunknown before the disappointment. We could then proclaim the\nmessage in unity.\n108 Selected Messages Book 2\nBut among those who had not held fast their faith and experience,\nthere was great confusion. Every conceivable opinion was presented\nas the message of truth; but the Lord\u2019s voice was, \u201cBelieve them not;\nfor I have not sent them.\u201d\nWe walked carefully with God. The message was to be given\nto the world, and we knew that this present light was the special\ngift of God. The impartation of this gift was the prerogative of\nGod. His disappointed ones, who were still seeking after truth,\nwere led step by step to communicate to the world that which had\nbeen communicated to them. The prophetic declarations were to\nbe repeated, and the truth essential for salvation was to be made\nknown. The work moved hard at first. Often the hearers rejected the\nmessage as unintelligible, and the conflict began in decided earnest,\nespecially upon the Sabbath question. But the Lord manifested His\npresence. At times the veil which concealed His glory from our eyes\nwas drawn aside. We beheld Him in the high and holy place.\nThe Lord will not lead minds now to set aside the truth that the\nHoly Spirit has moved upon His servants in the past to proclaim.\nMany will honestly search the Word for Light as those in the\npast have searched it; and they see light in the Word. But they did\nnot pass over the ground in their experience, when these messages\nof warning were first proclaimed. Not having had this experience,\nsome do not appreciate the value of the truths that have been to us\nas waymarks, and that have made us as a peculiar people what we\nare. They do not make a right application of the Scriptures, and thus\nthey frame theories that are not correct. It is true that they quote an\nabundance of Scripture, and teach much that is true; but truth is so\nmixed with error as to lead to wrong conclusions. Yet because they[111]\ncan weave Scripture into their theories, they think that they have a\nstraight chain of truth. Many who did not have an experience in the\nrise of the messages, accept these erroneous theories, and are led\ninto false paths, backward instead of forward. This is the enemy\u2019s\ndesign.\nThe Threat of Misapplied Scripture\nSatan is working that the history of the Jewish nation may be\nrepeated in the experience of those who claim to believe present\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 109\ntruth. The Jews had the Old Testament Scriptures, and supposed\nthemselves conversant with them. But they made a woeful mistake.\nThe prophecies that refer to the glorious second appearing of Christ\nin the clouds of heaven they regarded as referring to His first coming.\nBecause He did not come according to their expectations, they turned\naway from Him. Satan knew just how to take these men in his net,\nand deceive and destroy them....\nThe very same Satan is at work to undermine the faith of the\npeople of God at this time. There are persons ready to catch up\nevery new idea. The prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation are\nmisinterpreted. These persons do not consider that the truth has\nbeen set forth at the appointed time by the very men whom God\nwas leading to do this special work. These men followed on step\nby step in the very fulfillment of prophecy, and those who have not\nhad a personal experience in this work, are to take the Word of God\nand believe on \u201ctheir word\u201d who have been led by the Lord in the\nproclamation of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. These\nmessages, received and acted upon, are doing their work to prepare a\npeople to stand in the great day of God. If we search the Scriptures to\nconfirm the truth God has given His servants for the world, we shall\nbe found proclaiming the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages.\nIt is true that there are prophecies yet to be fulfilled. But very\nerroneous work has been done again and again, and will continue\nto be done by those who seek to find new light in the prophecies,\nand who begin by turning away from the light that God has already [112]\ngiven. The messages of Revelation 14 are those by which the world\nis to be tested; they are the everlasting gospel, and are to be sounded\neverywhere. But the Lord does not lay upon those who have not had\nan experience in His work the burden of making a new exposition\nof those prophecies which He has, by His Holy Spirit, moved upon\nHis chosen servants to explain.\nAccording to the light God has given me, this is the work which\nyou, Brother F, have been attempting to do. Your views have found\nfavor with some; but it is because these persons have not discernment\nto see the true bearing of the arguments you present. They have had\nbut a limited experience in the work of God for this time, and they\ndo not see where your views would lead them, and you do not see\nyourself where they would lead. They are ready to assent to your\n110 Selected Messages Book 2\nstatements; they see nothing in them but that which is correct. But\nthey are misled because you have woven together much Scripture\nin constructing your theory. Your arguments appear conclusive to\nthem.\nNot so, however, with those who have an experimental knowl-\nedge of the truth that applies in the last period of this earth\u2019s history.\nWhile they see that you hold some precious truth, they see also that\nyou have misapplied Scripture, placing it in a framework of error\nwhere it does not belong, and making it give force to that which is\nnot present truth. Because some accept that which you have written,\ndo not become elated. It is most trying to your brethren who have\nconfidence in you as a Christian and who love you as such, to state\nto you that the network of argument, which you have thought of so\ngreat consequence, is not the theory of truth that God has given His\npeople to proclaim for this time.\nThe light God has given me is that the Scriptures you have woven\ntogether you yourself do not fully understand. If you did, you would\ndiscern that your theories tear up the very foundation of our faith.\nMy brother, I have had many testimonies to correct those who\nhave started out in the same way you are now traveling. These[113]\npersons seemed sure that they were led by God, and they have come\nwith their different theories to ministers who were preaching the\ntruth. I said to these ministers, \u201cThe Lord is not in this; be not\ndeceived, neither take the responsibility of deceiving others.\u201d At\ncamp meetings I have had to speak plainly in regard to those who\nwere thus leading away from right paths. With pen and voice I have\nborne the message, \u201cGo not ye after them.\u201d\nDealing With a Dying Man\nThe hardest task I ever had to do in this line was in dealing with\none who, I knew, wanted to follow the Lord. For some time he had\nthought he was obtaining new light. He was very ill, and must soon\ndie. And oh, how my heart hoped he would not make it necessary for\nme to tell him just what he was doing. Those to whom he presented\nhis views listened to him eagerly, and some thought him inspired.\nHe had a chart made, and reasoned from the Scriptures to show that\nthe Lord would come at a certain date, in 1894, I think. To many his\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 111\nreasoning seemed to be without a flaw. They told of his powerful\nexhortations in his sickroom. Most wonderful views passed before\nhim. But what was the source of his inspiration? It was the morphine\ngiven him to relieve his pain.\nAt our camp meeting at Lansing, Michigan, just before I came to\nAustralia, I had to speak plainly in regard to this new light. I told the\npeople that the words they had heard were not the truth of inspiration.\nThe wonderful light, which presented such a show of truth, was the\nresult of a misapplication of Scripture. The Lord\u2019s work would not\nclose up in 1894. The word of the Lord to me was, \u201cThis is not truth,\nbut will lead into strange paths, and some will become confused\nover this representation, and will give up the faith\u201d....\nNo True Message Fixes Time\nNo one has a true message fixing the time when Christ is to come\nor not to come. Be assured that God gives no one authority to say\nthat Christ delays His coming five years, ten years, or twenty years. [114]\n\u201cBe ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man\ncometh\u201d (Matthew 24:44). This is our message, the very message\nthat the three angels flying in the midst of heaven are proclaiming.\nThe work to be done now is that of sounding this last message of\nmercy to a fallen world. A new life is coming from heaven and\ntaking possession of all God\u2019s people. But divisions will come in the\nchurch. Two parties will be developed. The wheat and tares grow\nup together for the harvest.\nThe work will grow deeper and become more earnest to the very\nclose of time. And all who are laborers together with God will\ncontend most earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.\nThey will not be turned from the present message, which is already\nlightening the earth with its glory. Nothing is worth contending for\nbut the glory of God. The only rock that will stand is the Rock of\nAges. The truth as it is in Jesus is the refuge in these days of error....\nMessages Given for our Day\nProphecy has been fulfilling, line upon line. The more firmly we\nstand under the banner of the third angel\u2019s message, the more clearly\nshall we understand the prophecy of Daniel; for the Revelation is the\n112 Selected Messages Book 2\nsupplement of Daniel. The more fully we accept the light presented\nby the Holy Spirit through the consecrated servants of God, the\ndeeper and surer, even as the eternal throne, will appear the truths\nof ancient prophecy; we shall be assured that men of God spake as\nthey were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. Men must themselves\nbe under the influence of the Holy Spirit in order to understand the\nSpirit\u2019s utterances through the prophets. These messages were given,\nnot for those that uttered the prophecies, but for us who are living\namid the scenes of their fulfillment.\nI would not feel that I could present these things, if the Lord had\nnot given me this work to do. There are others besides yourself, and\nmore than one or two, who like you think they have new light, and\nare all ready to present it to the people. But it would be pleasing to[115]\nGod for them to accept the light already given and walk in it, and\nbase their faith upon the Scriptures, which sustain the positions held\nby the people of God for many years. The everlasting gospel is to\nbe proclaimed by human agents. We are to sound the messages of\nthe angels which are represented as flying in the midst of heaven,\nwith the last warning to a fallen world. If we are not called upon to\nprophesy, we are called to believe the prophecies, and to cooperate\nwith God in giving light to other minds. This we are trying to do.\nYou can help us, my brother, in many ways. But I am commis-\nsioned of the Lord to say to you that you are not to be self-centered.\nTake heed how you hear, how you understand, and how you ap-\npropriate the Word of God. The Lord will bless you in drawing in\neven lines with your brethren. Those whom He has sent forth to\nproclaim the third angel\u2019s message have been working in unison\nwith the heavenly intelligences. The Lord does not lay upon you a\nburden to proclaim a message that will bring discord into the ranks\nof believers. I repeat, He is not leading anyone by His Holy Spirit\nto frame a theory that will unsettle faith in the solemn messages He\nhas given His people to bear to our world.\nI advise you not to regard your writings as precious truth. It\nwould not be advisable for you to immortalize by putting in print\nthat which has cost you so much anxiety. It is not the Lord\u2019s will\nthat this matter should be brought before His people, for it will work\nto hinder the very message of truth they are to believe and practice\nin these last days of peril....\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 113\nTheories will be continually agitated to divert the mind, to un-\nsettle the faith. Those who have had the actual experience in the\nunfolding of the prophecies, have been made what they are today,\nSeventh-day Adventists, by these prophecies. They are to stand with\ntheir loins girt about with truth, and with the whole armor on. Those\nwho have not had this experience are privileged to hold the message\nof truth with the same confidence. The light that God has been\npleased to give His people will not weaken their confidence in the [116]\npath in which He has led them in the past, but will strengthen them\nto hold fast the faith. We must hold the beginning of our confidence\nfirm unto the end.\n\u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\u201d (Revelation 14:12).\nHere we stand, under the third angel\u2019s message. \u201cAnd after these\nthings I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great\npower; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried\nmightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is\nfallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every\nfoul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all\nnations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and\nthe kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the\nmerchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her\ndelicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come\nout of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that\nye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached unto heaven,\nand God hath remembered her iniquities\u201d (Revelation 18:1-5).\nThe Message of the Other Angel\nThus the substance of the second angel\u2019s message is again given\nto the world by that other angel who lightens the earth with his glory.\nThese messages all blend in one, to come before the people in the\nclosing days of this earth\u2019s history. All the world will be tested, and\nall that have been in the darkness of error in regard to the Sabbath of\nthe fourth commandment will understand the last message of mercy\nthat is to be given to men.\nOur work is to proclaim the commandments of God and the testi-\nmony of Jesus Christ. \u201cPrepare to meet thy God\u201d (Amos 4:12), is the\n114 Selected Messages Book 2\nwarning to be given to the world. It is a warning to us individually.\nWe are called upon to lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth\nso easily beset us. There is a work for you, my brother, to do, to\nyoke up with Christ. Make sure that your building is on the rock.\nDo not risk eternity on a probability. You may not live to participate[117]\nin the perilous scenes on which we are now entering. The life of\nno one of us is assured for any given time. Should you not watch\nevery moment? Should you not closely examine your own self, and\ninquire, What will eternity be to me?\nThe great burden of every soul should be, Is my heart renewed? Is\nmy soul transformed? Are my sins pardoned through faith in Christ?\nHave I been born again? Am I complying with the invitation, \u201cCome\nunto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you\nrest\u201d (Matthew 11:28)? ... Do you count all things but loss for the\nexcellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus? And do you feel it\nyour duty to believe every word that proceeds out of the mouth of\nGod?\u2014Manuscript 32, 1896.\nTwo Temple Cleansings\u2014Two Calls Out of Babylon\nWhile you hold the banner of truth firmly, proclaiming the law\nof God, let every soul remember that the faith of Jesus is connected\nwith the commandments of God. The third angel is represented as\nflying through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, \u201cHere\nare they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\u201d\n(Revelation 14:12). The first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages\nare all linked together. The evidences of the abiding, ever-living\ntruth of these grand messages, that mean so much to us, that have\nawakened such intense opposition from the religious world, cannot\nbe extinguished. Satan is constantly seeking to cast his hellish\nshadow about these messages, so that the remnant people of God\nshall not clearly discern their import, their time, and place; but they\nlive, and are to exert their power upon our religious experience while\ntime shall last.\nThe influence of these messages has been deepening and widen-\ning, setting in motion the springs of action in thousands of hearts,\nbringing into existence institutions of learning, publishing houses,\nand health institutions; all these are the instrumentalities of God to\nThree Angels and the Other Angel 115\ncooperate in the grand work represented by the first, second, and\nthird angels flying in the midst of heaven to warn the inhabitants of [118]\nthe world that Christ is coming again with power and great glory.\nThe prophet says, \u201cI saw another angel come down from heaven,\nhaving great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory. And\nhe cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is\nfallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils\u201d (Revelation\n18:1, 2). This is the same message that was given by the second\nangel. Babylon is fallen, \u201cbecause she made all nations drink of the\nwine of the wrath of her fornication\u201d (Revelation 14:8). What is\nthat wine?\u2014Her false doctrines. She has given to the world a false\nsabbath instead of the Sabbath of the fourth commandment, and has\nrepeated the falsehood that Satan first told Eve in Eden\u2014the natural\nimmortality of the soul. Many kindred errors she has spread far and\nwide, \u201cteaching for doctrines the commandments of men\u201d (Matthew\n15:9).\nWhen Jesus began His public ministry, He cleansed the Temple\nfrom its sacrilegious profanation. Among the last acts of His ministry\nwas the second cleansing of the Temple. So in the last work for the\nwarning of the world, two distinct calls are made to the churches.\nThe second angel\u2019s message is, \u201cBabylon is fallen, is fallen, that\ngreat city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the\nwrath of her fornication\u201d (Revelation 14:8). And in the loud cry\nof the third angel\u2019s message a voice is heard from heaven saying,\n\u201cCome out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins,\nand that ye receive not of her plagues. For her sins have reached\nunto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities\u201d (Revelation\n18:4, 5).\u2014The Review and Herald, December 6, 1892.\n116 Selected Messages Book 2\nSection 3\u2014Unwise Affiliations [119]\n[120]\nIntroduction\nEarly in her sojourn in Australia (1891-1900) Ellen White was\ncalled upon to give counsel to a prominent worker in our publishing\nhouse who had become deeply involved in the activities of the Ma-\nsonic Lodge. The counsel she presented to this brother led him to\nsever his connections with the lodge in spite of the fact that he had\nattained the highest degree of honor in the organization.\nWithout condemning, Mrs. White pointed out that the Christian\ncannot serve two masters, or render allegiance to two authorities.\nOur brother, who had become so involved in lodge activities that\nhis work for the church had been sadly neglected, recognized the\nsimple truth in the Ellen G. White counsels, and his confidence in\nthe message was confirmed as Mrs. White\u2014unbeknown to herself\u2014\ngave the secret sign used only by members of the lodge. He promptly\nsurrendered his membership in the lodge, although he had stoutly\naffirmed on a number of occasions that nothing would shake his\nconfidence in the fraternal organization or lead him to break with it.\nLooking back to this experience in later years, he testified that the\nSpirit of Prophecy message completely changed his life.\nAt this time and in this connection, Mrs. White wrote quite\nfully concerning the relationship of Seventh-day Adventists to such\norganizations. This was published under the title \u201cShould Christians\nBe Members of Secret Societies?\u201d In pamphlet form, it had wide\ncirculation in Australia and in the United States, but it has long been\nout of print. This pamphlet is reprinted here in its entirety.\nThe second chapter is composed of counsels from the pen of Mrs.\nWhite relating to the attitude that Seventh-day Adventists should\ntake toward labor organizations. This material was published in\n1946 as Section II in the pamphlet Country Living. It appears here\nin this permanent form for continued and prayerful study.\nWhite Trustees.\n118\nChapter 13\u2014Should Christians Be Members of [121]\nSecret Societies?\n[Reprinted from a pamphlet by this title published in 1893.]\n\u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what\nfellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what com-\nmunion hath light with darkness? and what concord hath Christ\nwith Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and\nwhat agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the\ntemple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and\nwalk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.\nWherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the\nLord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and\nwill be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters,\nsaith the Lord Almighty\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:14-18).\nThe Lord\u2019s injunction, \u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together with\nunbelievers\u201d (2 Corinthians 6:14), refers not only to the marriage of\nChristians with the ungodly, but to all alliances in which the parties\nare brought into intimate association, and in which there is need of\nharmony in spirit and action. The Lord gave special direction to\nIsrael to keep themselves distinct from idolaters. They were not to [122]\nintermarry with the heathen nor form any confederacy with them:\n\u201cTake heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants\nof the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of\nthee: but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut\ndown their groves: for thou shalt worship no other god: for the Lord,\nwhose name is Jealous, is a jealous God\u201d (Exodus 34:12-14).\n\u201cFor thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God: the Lord\nthy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above\nall people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set\nhis love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number\nthan any people; for ye were the fewest of all people: but because\nthe Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he\n119\n120 Selected Messages Book 2\nhad sworn unto your fathers.... Know therefore that the Lord thy\nGod, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy\nwith them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand\ngenerations\u201d (Deuteronomy 7:6-9).\nAgain the Lord declares through the prophet Isaiah:\n\u201cAssociate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in\npieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye\nshall be broken in pieces; Take counsel together, and it shall come\nto nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with\nus. For the Lord spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed\nme that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, Say ye\nnot, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people shall say, A\nconfederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the\nLord of hosts himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your\ndread\u201d (Isaiah 8:9-13).\nThere are those who question whether it is right for Christians\nto belong to the Free Masons and other secret societies. Let all\nsuch consider the scriptures just quoted. If we are Christians at all,\nwe must be Christians everywhere, and must consider and heed the\ncounsel given to make us Christians according to the standard of\nGod\u2019s Word.\nCooperation With Divine Agencies[123]\nThe people of God on earth are the human agents that are to\ncooperate with divine agencies for the salvation of men. To the\nsouls that have joined themselves to Him, Christ says, \u201cYou are\none with Me, \u2018labourers together with God\u2019\u201d (1 Corinthians 3:9).\nGod is the great and unperceived actor; man is the humble and seen\nagent, and it is only in cooperation with the heavenly agencies that\nhe can do anything good. It is only as the mind is enlightened by the\nHoly Spirit that men discern the divine agency. And hence Satan\nis constantly seeking to divert minds from the divine to the human,\nthat man may not cooperate with Heaven. He directs the attention to\nhuman inventions, leading men to trust in man, to make flesh their\narm, so that their faith does not take hold upon God.\n\u201cThe light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single,\nthy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, thy\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 121\nwhole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in\nthee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\u201d (Matthew 6:22, 23).\nAnd when our light becomes darkness, how shall we be a light\nto the world?\nThe work of our personal salvation also depends upon our co-\noperation with the divine agencies. God has imparted to us moral\npowers and religious susceptibilities. He has given His Son as a\npropitiation for our sins, that we might be reconciled to God. Jesus\nlived a life of self-denial and sacrifice, that we might follow His\nexample. He has given the Holy Spirit to be in Christ\u2019s stead in every\nplace where help is needed. He employs the heavenly intelligences\nto bring divine power to combine with our human efforts. But we\nmust accept the gift of God, we must repent, and believe in Christ.\nWe must watch, we must pray, we must obey the requirements of\nGod. We must practice self-denial and self-sacrifice for Christ\u2019s\nsake. We must grow up into Christ by constant connection with\nHim. Whatever turns the mind away from God to trust in man, or\nconform to a human standard, will prevent us from cooperating with [124]\nGod in the work of our own salvation. This is why the Lord forbade\nHis people to form any alliance with the heathen, \u201clest it be for a\nsnare in the midst of thee\u201d (Exodus 34:12). He said, \u201cThey will turn\naway thy son from following me\u201d (Deuteronomy 7:4). And the same\nprinciple applies to the association of Christians with the ungodly.\nIn Covenant Relation\nWhen we accepted Christ as our Redeemer, we accepted the\ncondition of becoming laborers together with God. We made a\ncovenant with Him to be wholly for the Lord; as faithful stewards of\nthe grace of Christ, to labor for the upbuilding of His kingdom in the\nworld. Every follower of Christ stands pledged to dedicate all his\npowers of mind and soul and body to Him who has paid the ransom\nmoney for our souls. We engaged to be soldiers, to enter into active\nservice, to endure trials, shame, reproach, to fight the fight of faith,\nfollowing the Captain of our salvation.\nIn your connection with worldly societies are you keeping your\ncovenant with God? Do these associations tend to direct your own\nmind or that of others to God, or are they diverting the interest and\n122 Selected Messages Book 2\nattention from Him? Do they strengthen your connection with the\ndivine agencies, or turn your mind to the human in place of the\ndivine?\nAre you serving, honoring, and magnifying God, or are you\ndishonoring Him and sinning against Him? Are you gathering with\nChrist or scattering abroad? All the thought and plan and earnest\ninterest devoted to these organizations has been purchased by the\nprecious blood of Christ; but are you doing service for Him when\nuniting yourselves with atheists and infidels, men who profane the\nname of God, tipplers, drunkards, tobacco devotees?\nWhile there may be in these societies much that appears to be\ngood, there is, mingled with this, very much that makes the good of\nno effect, and renders these associations detrimental to the interests\nof the soul. We have another life than that which is sustained by[125]\ntemporal food. \u201cMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word\nthat proceedeth out of the mouth of God\u201d (Matthew 4:4). \u201cExcept ye\neat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye have no life in\nyou\u201d (John 6:53). Jesus said, \u201cWhoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh\nmy blood, hath eternal life\u201d (John 6:54). Our bodies are built up\nfrom what we eat and drink. And as in the natural, so in the spiritual\neconomy; it is that which our minds dwell upon which sustains the\nspiritual nature. Our Saviour said, \u201cIt is the spirit that quickeneth;\nthe flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are\nspirit, and they are life\u201d (John 6:63). Spiritual life must be sustained\nby communion with Christ through His Word. The mind must dwell\nupon it, the heart must be filled with it. The Word of God laid up\nin the heart and sacredly cherished and obeyed, through the power\nof the grace of Christ can make man right, and keep him right; but\nevery human influence, every earthly invention, is powerless to give\nstrength and wisdom to man. It cannot restrain passion, or correct\ndeformity of character. Unless the truth of God controls the heart,\nthe conscience will be warped. But in these worldly societies the\nmind is turned away from the Word of God. Men are not led to make\nit the study and the guide of life.\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 123\nIs God Honored?\nI ask you who take pleasure in these associations, who love the\ngathering for indulgence in wit and merriment and feasting, Do you\ntake Jesus with you? Are you seeking to save the souls of your\ncompanions? Is that the object of your association with them? Do\nthey see and feel that there is in you a living embodiment of the\nSpirit of Christ? Is it manifest that you are a witness for Christ,\nthat you belong to a peculiar people, zealous of good works? Is it\nmanifest that your life is governed by the divine precepts, \u201cThou\nshalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,\nand with all thy mind\u201d (Matthew 22:37), and, \u201cThou shalt love thy\nneighbour as thyself\u201d (Matthew 19:19)? To speak to the hearts and [126]\nconsciences of those that are ready to perish, is beyond the power of\none who does not himself surrender all for Christ. But where do your\nfluency and warmth of speech show that your interest is centered?\nIn these societies what are the favorite subjects of conversation?\nWhat are the themes that excite interest and give pleasure? Are they\nnot the gratification of the senses\u2014eating and drinking and pleasure\nseeking? The presence of Christ is unknown in these gatherings. No\nreference is made to Him. His companionship is not desired. Where\nand when is God honored by such associations? Wherein is the\nsoul in the least benefited? If you do not influence your companions\nfor good, are they not influencing you for evil? Will it do to lay\naside the lamp of life, God\u2019s Word, and mingle freely with this class\nof associates, and come to their level? Do you think you can find\nsomething to satisfy the hunger of the soul apart from truth and\nthe favor of God? Shall those who profess to believe the truth for\nthis time be at home in such scenes, when God is not in all their\nthoughts?\nIn the same room where these societies have had their gatherings,\nthe congregations have met to worship God. Can you during the\nsacred hour of divine service forget the scenes of merriment and\nfeasting, and indulgence in the wine cup? All this God writes in His\nbook as intemperance. How does it blend with eternal realities? Do\nyou forget that at all these pleasure gatherings there is a Witness\npresent, as at the feast of Belshazzar? Could the curtain that separates\nus from the invisible world be rolled back, you would behold the\n124 Selected Messages Book 2\nSaviour grieved to see men absorbed in the pleasures of the table,\nin hilarity and witticism, that put Christ, the center of the world\u2019s\nhope, out of their thoughts.\nThose who cannot discern between him that serveth God and\nhim that serveth Him not, may be charmed with these societies that\nhave no connection with God, but no earnest Christian can prosper\nin such an atmosphere. The vital air of heaven is not there. His soul\nis barren, and he feels as destitute of the refreshing of the Holy Spirit[127]\nas were the hills of Gilboa of dew and rain.\nAt times the follower of Christ may by circumstances be com-\npelled to witness scenes of unholy pleasure, but it is with a sorrowful\nheart. The language is not the language of Canaan, and the child\nof God will never choose such associations. When he is necessar-\nily brought into society that he does not choose, let him lean upon\nGod, and the Lord will preserve him. But he is not to sacrifice his\nprinciples in any case, whatever the temptation.\nNot of Christ\nChrist will never lead His followers to take upon themselves\nvows that will unite them with men who have no connection with\nGod, who are not under the controlling influence of His Holy Spirit.\nThe only correct standard of character is the holy law of God, and it\nis impossible for those who make that law the rule of life to unite in\nconfidence and cordial brotherhood with those who turn the truth of\nGod into a lie, and regard the authority of God as a thing of nought.\nBetween the worldly man and the one who is faithfully serving\nGod, there is a great gulf fixed. Upon the most momentous sub-\njects\u2014God and truth and eternity\u2014their thoughts and sympathies\nand feelings are not in harmony. One class is ripening as wheat for\nthe garner of God, the other as tares for the fires of destruction. How\ncan there be unity of purpose or action between them?\n\u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with\nGod? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy\nof God\u201d (James 4:4).\n\u201cNo man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one,\nand love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the\nother. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\u201d (Matthew 6:24).\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 125\nBut we are to beware of indulging a spirit of bigotry and intol-\nerance. We are not to stand aside from others in a spirit that seems\nto say, \u201cCome not near me; I am holier than thou.\u201d Do not shut\nyourselves away from your fellow men, but seek to impart to them [128]\nthe precious truth that has blessed your own heart. Let it be manifest\nthat yours is the religion of love.\n\u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your good\nworks, and glorify your Father which is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 5:16).\nBut if we are Christians, having the Spirit of Him who died to\nsave men from their sins, we shall love the souls of our fellow men\ntoo well to countenance their sinful pleasures by our presence or\nour influence. We cannot sanction their course by associating with\nthem, partaking in their feasts and their councils, where God does\nnot preside. Such a course, so far from benefiting them, would only\ncause them to doubt the reality of our religion. We should be false\nlights, by our example leading souls to ruin.\nI lately read of a noble ship that was plowing its way across the\nsea, when at midnight, with a terrific crash, it struck upon a rock;\nthe passengers were awakened only to see with horror their hopeless\ncondition, and with the ship they sank to rise no more. The man at\nthe helm had mistaken the beacon light, and hundreds of souls were\nat a moment\u2019s warning launched into eternity. If we present a phase\nof character that misrepresents Christ, we present a false light, and\nsouls will surely be misled by our example.\nDanger of Spiritual Declension\nAnd Christians who connect themselves with worldly associa-\ntions are injuring themselves as well as misleading others. Those\nwho fear God cannot choose the ungodly for companions, and be\nthemselves unharmed. In these societies they are brought under the\ninfluence of worldly principles and customs, and through the power\nof association and habit the mind becomes more and more con-\nformed to the worldling\u2019s standard. Their love for God grows cold,\nand they have no desire for communion with Him. They become\nspiritually blind. They can see no particular difference between the\ntransgressor of God\u2019s law and those who fear God and keep His [129]\ncommandments. They call evil good, and good evil. The brightness\n126 Selected Messages Book 2\nof eternal realities fades away. The truth may be presented to them\nin ever so forcible a manner, but they do not hunger for the bread of\nlife, or thirst for the waters of salvation. They are drinking at broken\ncisterns that can hold no water. Oh, it is an easy thing, by association\nwith the world, to catch their spirit, to be molded by their views of\nthings, so that we do not discern the preciousness of Jesus and the\ntruth. And just to the degree that the spirit of the world dwells in our\nheart, it will control our life.\nWhen men are not under the control of the Word and the Spirit\nof God, they are captives of Satan, and we know not to what lengths\nhe may lead them in sin. The patriarch Jacob beheld those who\ntake pleasure in wickedness. He saw what would be the result of\nassociation with them, and in the Spirit he exclaimed, \u201cO my soul,\ncome not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour,\nbe not thou united\u201d (Genesis 49:6). He lifts up the danger signal,\nto warn every soul against such associations. The apostle Paul\nechoes the warning: \u201cHave no fellowship with the unfruitful works\nof darkness\u201d (Ephesians 5:11). \u201cBe not deceived: Evil company\ndoth corrupt good manners\u201d (1 Corinthians 15:33, R.V .).\nThe soul is deceived when it trusts to worldly policy and human\ninventions instead of trusting in the Lord God of Israel. Can man\nfind a better guide than the Lord Jesus? a better counselor in doubt\nand trial? a better defense in danger? To set aside the wisdom of\nGod for human wisdom is a soul-destroying delusion.\nIf you would see what man will do when he rejects the influence\nof the grace of God, look to that scene in the judgment hall, when the\ninfuriated mob, headed by Jewish priests and elders, clamored for the\nlife of the Son of God. See the divine Sufferer standing by the side\nof Barabbas, and Pilate asking which he should release unto them.\nThe hoarse cry, swelled by hundreds of passionate, Satan- inspired\nvoices, is, \u201cAway with this man, and release unto us Barabbas\u201d (Luke[130]\n23:18)! And when Pilate asked what was to be done with Jesus they\ncried, \u201cCrucify him, crucify him\u201d (Luke 23:21)!\nHuman nature then is human nature now. When the divine\nRemedy that would have saved and exalted human nature is despised,\nthe same spirit still lives in the hearts of men, and we cannot trust to\ntheir guidance and maintain our loyalty to Christ.\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 127\nGod Looks Beneath the Surface\nThese societies, that are not controlled by the love and fear of\nGod, will not be found true and upright toward man. Many of\ntheir transactions are contrary to justice and equity. He who is of\ntoo pure eyes to behold evil will not, cannot, be a party to many\nthings that take place in these associations. Your own conscience\nwill bear witness to the truth of what I say. The talent and skill\nand inventive power with which God has endowed men are, in these\nassociations, too often perverted to instruments of cruelty, of iniquity,\nof selfishness in practicing fraud upon their fellow men.\nOf course all this is denied by the members of these bodies. But\nGod looks beneath the pleasant, attractive appearance, to the secret,\nunderlying motives and the real working of the association. While\nsome of them claim to make the Word of God in a certain sense the\nbasis of their organization, they depart far from the principles of\nrighteousness. The vows imposed by some of these orders require\nthe taking of human life when the secrets of the order are divulged.\nMembers are also pledged, under certain circumstances, to clear the\nguilty from deserved punishment. Toward those who work against\nthe order, they are required to pursue a course that is not at all in\nharmony with the law of God.\nWe cannot swerve from the truth, we cannot depart from right\nprinciples, without forsaking Him who is our strength, our righ-\nteousness, and our sanctification. We should be firmly rooted in the\nconviction that whatever in any sense turns us aside from truth and\njustice in our association and partnership with men, cannot benefit [131]\nus, and greatly dishonors God. Every species of deceit or conniving\nat sin is abhorrent to Him.\nFraud runs all through these secret associations, and none can\nbe bound up with them and be free men before God and heaven.\nThe moral nature is dragged down to that which God pronounces\nunjust, which is contrary to His will and His commandments. One\nwho professes to love God, may in these associations be placed\nin positions which are called honorable, but in the eyes of God he\nis tarnishing his honor as a Christian, and separating farther and\nfarther from the principles of righteousness and true holiness. He\n128 Selected Messages Book 2\nis perverting his powers, that have been purchased by the blood of\nJesus. He is selling his soul for nought.\nIn the revelation of His righteous judgments, God will break up\nall these associations; and when the judgment shall sit and the books\nbe opened, there will be revealed the un-Christlikeness of the whole\nconfederacy. Those who choose to unite with these secret societies\nare paying homage to idols as senseless and as powerless to bless\nand save the soul as are the gods of the Hindus.\nThese societies offer some advantages which from a human\npoint of view appear like great blessings, but not so when judged\nby the Lord\u2019s measurement. Behind their apparent advantages are\nconcealed satanic agencies. The larger the income drawn into the\ntreasury, the more and deeper is the evil. The ungodly gain which\nhas enriched these societies will, when traced out in all its bearings,\nbe seen to be a curse. The words which Eliphaz spoke to Job are\ntrue in respect to these associations: \u201cI saw him \u2018taking root,\u2019 but I\n\u2018cursed his habitation\u2019\u201d (Job 5:3). They are Satan\u2019s traps, his net to\nentangle souls.\nA Question of Loyalty to God\nVery many things are sanctioned and upheld by the world when\nthey are an offense to the Holy One of Israel. It was seemingly a\nsmall thing for Eve to depart from God\u2019s specified restrictions and do\nthe thing He told her not to do, and for Adam to follow her example;[132]\nbut that very thing was planned by the archdeceiver to destroy the\nsouls of men by leading them to follow their own imaginations rather\nthan the revealed will of God. So in these associations principles\nare held that bring men under the deceptive power of Satan, leading\naway from safe paths into rebellion against God and disregard of His\nholy standard of righteousness. \u201cWatch ye and pray, lest ye enter\ninto temptation\u201d (Mark 14:38), is the oft-repeated injunction of our\nSaviour. Watch, watch with diligence and care, lest Satan succeed\nin ensnaring the souls of those for whom Christ has paid the ransom\nmoney of His own blood.\nGod calls upon you who would be His children to act as under\nthe divine eye, to adopt the holy standard of righteousness. His\njustice and His truth are the principles that should be established\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 129\nin every soul. He who preserves his integrity toward God, will be\nupright toward man. No man who truly loves God, will, for the sake\nof a bribe of gold and silver, of honor, or any other earthly advantage,\nexpose his soul to temptation. \u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall\ngain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man\ngive in exchange for his soul?\u201d (Mark 8:36, 37).\nChristians must sever every tie that binds them to these secret\norders that are not under the control of God. They cannot be loyal\nto these organizations and loyal to God. Either the connection with\nthese bodies must be severed or you will assimilate more closely\nto them, and as the result will come to unite more fully with them,\nand will sever the ties that bind you to those who love and fear God.\nThe Christian will abandon those things which are a hindrance to\nhis spirituality, be the sacrifice ever so great. Better lose money,\npossessions, and life itself, than to imperil the vital interests of the\nsoul.\nStewards of God\nYou who have connected yourselves with these secret societies\nare trusting in a staff that will be broken in pieces; you do not trust [133]\nin the Lord God of Israel, diligently searching to know His will and\nto follow in His way. When you invest money in these organizations,\nyou do so in the hope of making provision for the future. You have\ngiven them time and thought and labor and money, while the cause of\nChrist has been neglected. Every dollar paid into these organizations\nis as truly turned away from the cause of God as if sunk in the ocean.\nBut was not this capital entrusted to you of God to use in His service,\nfor the salvation of your fellow men? By investing it where it cannot\nhonor God or benefit men, you are repeating the sin of the slothful\nservant who hid his Lord\u2019s talent in the earth.\nThe Lord had entrusted to the unfaithful servant not a large\ncapital, but only one talent. That one talent the man did not invest\nfor the interest of God; he hid it in the earth, complaining that\nthe Lord was a hard Master, reaping where He had not sown, and\ngathering where He had not strown. The selfishness he manifested,\nand the complaints he made, as though God would require of him\nthat which He had no right to claim, showed that he did not know\n130 Selected Messages Book 2\nGod, or Jesus Christ, whom He had sent. Everything he possessed\nwas the Lord\u2019s own property, and was entrusted to him to use for\nGod. When he says, \u201cI was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the\nearth\u201d (Matthew 25:25), he acknowledged that the talent was from\nGod.\nAnd what saith the Lord?\u2014\u201cThou wicked and slothful servant,\nthou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have\nnot strawed\u201d (Matthew 25:26). Here He repeats the servant\u2019s words,\nnot acknowledging their truth, but showing what, even according to\nhis own account, the servant ought to have done. The Lord virtually\nsays: \u201cYou made no effort to trade upon My entrusted capital, and to\ngain an increase to promote My glory in the earth. \u201cThou oughtest\n... to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I\nshould have received mine own with usury. Take therefore the talent\nfrom him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents. For unto\nevery one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but[134]\nfrom him that hath not [traded on his Lord\u2019s goods] shall be taken\naway even that which he hath. And cast ye the unprofitable servant\ninto outer darkness\u201d (Matthew 25:27-30). To every soul to whom\nthe light of truth has come is this lesson given.\nWe should never forget that God has placed us on trial in this\nworld, to determine our fitness for the future life. None can enter\nheaven whose characters are defiled by the foul blot of selfishness.\nTherefore God tests us here by committing to us temporal posses-\nsions, that our use of these may show whether we can be entrusted\nwith eternal riches. It is only as the self-sacrificing life of Christ is\nreflected in our life that we can be in harmony with heaven, and be\nfitted to enter there.\nWhere Are We Placing Our Treasures?\nBut the great study and ambition of the world is to obtain ma-\nterial, temporal advantages, to the neglect of spiritual good. Thus\nit is with some members of the church. When at last they shall be\ncalled to render their account to God, they will not only be ashamed\nbut astonished that they did not discern the true riches, and have\nnot laid up treasure in the heavens. They have bestowed their gifts\nand offerings upon the enemies of truth, expecting a time to come\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 131\nin this life when they would receive the returns for what they have\ninvested. They could entrust their means to secret societies, but\nwhen the cause of God is in need of the means He has committed to\nHis human agents, they feel no interest, they do not consider the gift\nthat the Lord has made to them. They are blinded by the god of this\nworld.\nThey say: \u201cI have nothing to give to this enterprise; for I shall\nreceive no returns. In paying to the lodge, I am providing for the\nfuture, and, besides this, I must bear my share of expense for the\nentertainments that gratify my taste. I cannot give up these enjoy-\nments. Why does the church look to me to help meet these constantly\nrecurring demands? \u2018Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man,\nreaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not [135]\nstrawed: and I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth\u2019\n[Matthew 25:24, 25], expecting that some time I would be benefited\nby it.\u201d\nThe Saviour bids us: \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon\nearth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break\nthrough and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\nwhere neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not\nbreak through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your\nheart be also\u201d (Matthew 6:19-21).\nMany are laying up their treasure in these secret societies, and\ncan we not see that their heart is there? However powerful may be\nthe evidences of truth, little by little it loses its brightness, loses\nits force, heaven fades from the mind, the eternal weight of glory,\nthe gift of God for a life of obedience, appears a matter unworthy\nof notice in comparison with the supposed benefits to be realized\nin laying up earthly treasure. Souls are starving for the bread and\nwater of life; but what is that to him whose heart is set on this world?\nMany a man is saying by his actions, if not in words, \u201cI cannot\nlet go my interest in these earthly treasures, to secure that which\nis eternal. The life to come is too remote for me to count upon.\nI choose the earthly goods, and I will run the risk of the future.\nGod is good and merciful.\u201d Slothful servant! your portion is just as\nsurely appointed with hypocrites and unbelievers as you continue to\npursue this course. The fascination of the club room, the suppers,\n132 Selected Messages Book 2\nand the world-loving associates, has led, as did Belshazzar\u2019s feast,\nto forgetfulness of God and dishonoring of His name.\nWill You Cooperate With God?\nThere is a blindness upon human minds that is willful. Jesus\nsaid, \u201cThis people\u2019s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of\nhearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should\nsee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand\nwith their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them\u201d\n(Matthew 13:15). The work of God for the salvation of men is the[136]\none work of supreme importance to be carried forward in our world;\nbut many do not see this, because their interest is more with the\nranks of the enemy than with the loyal soldiers of Christ. They do\nnot see the necessity of the cooperation of the human with the divine\nagency. The Lord has bidden us: \u201cWork out your own salvation with\nfear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will\nand to do of his good pleasure\u201d (Philippians 2:12, 13). This is the\nplan which God has revealed to us to guide us in all the plans and\npurposes of life. But while men pray, \u201cThy kingdom come. Thy will\nbe done in earth, as it is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 6:10), many reject the\nvery means by which God would establish His kingdom.\nWhen they are willing to count all things but loss that they may\nwin Christ, their eyes will be opened to see things as they really are.\nThen they will turn away from the earthly attractions to the heavenly.\nThen they will see the true nature of the worldly, selfish enjoyments\nthat they now value so highly, and these things that they now hold\nso dear will be given up.\nAll heaven is looking upon you who claim to believe the most\nsacred truth ever committed to mortals. Angels are waiting with\nlonging desire to cooperate with you in working for the salvation of\nsouls. Will you refuse this heavenly alliance in order to maintain\nyour connection with society where God is not honored, where\nHis commandments are trampled upon? How would the truth ever\nhave been brought to you if others had felt so little interest in its\nadvancement as some of you manifest? The cause of God demands\nour help, that it may be established upon a proper basis, and that\nthe truth may be carried forward into new fields, to those who are\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 133\nready to perish. Can you who claim to be sons of God refuse to\naid in this work? Will you, in order to receive an earthly return,\nwithhold your means from the treasury of God, and let His work be\nshamefully neglected? It is grievous to consider what might have\nbeen accomplished in the saving of souls if the heart and service of\nall who profess to believe the truth had been undividedly given to [137]\nGod. Work has been negligently done. If self had been hid in Christ,\nsinners might, through wise, ingenious methods, have been won to\nthe truth, and today be in cooperation with God.\nNow, before the time comes when you must render up your\naccount to God, I urge you to give heed to His word, \u201cLay up for\nyourselves\u201d a \u201ctreasure in the heavens\u201d (Matthew 6:20; Luke 12:33),\nnot in secret societies. Consider that there is only one Proprietor\nof the universe, and that every man, with his time, his intellect, his\nresources, belongs to the One who has paid the ransom for the soul.\nGod has a righteous claim to constant service and supreme affection.\nGod\u2019s will, not your pleasure, is to be your criterion. And though\nyou should accumulate a fortune less rapidly, you are laying up\ntreasure in heaven. Who of the church is resolved to maintain his\nspirituality? Who will develop an experience that reveals Christian\nfervor, persevering energy? Who, like Jesus, will not fail nor be\ndiscouraged, not in grasping means for the service of self, but in\nlaboring together with God?\nAll who are striving for the crown of everlasting life will be\ntempted as was their Master before them. He was proffered the\nkingdoms of the world if He would pay homage to Satan. Had Christ\nyielded to this temptation, the world would have passed forever under\nthe sway of the wicked one. But, thank God, His divinity shone\nthrough humanity. He did that which every human being may do\nin the name and strength of Jesus. He said, \u201cGet thee hence, Satan:\nfor it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him\nonly shalt thou serve\u201d (Matthew 4:10). If this is the way you meet\ntemptation, Satan will leave you, as he left Christ, and angels will\nminister unto you, as they ministered unto Him.\nTo those who have thought and talked of the great advantages\nto be gained by worldly association, the Lord declares, through the\nprophet Malachi:\n134 Selected Messages Book 2\n\u201cYour words have been stout against Me, saith the Lord. Yet\nye say, What have we spoken so much against Thee? Ye have said,\nIt is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept His[138]\nordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord\nof hosts? And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work\nwickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered\u201d\n(Malachi 3:13-15).\nThese are the thoughts of many, if the words are not spoken.\n\u201cThen they that feared the Lord spake often one to another: and\nthe Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was\nwritten before Him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought\nupon His name. And they shall be Mine, saith the Lord of hosts,\nin that day when I make up My jewels; and I will spare them, as\na man spareth his own son that serveth him. Then shall ye return,\nand discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that\nserveth God and him that serveth Him not. For, behold, the day\ncometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all\nthat do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall\nburn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither\nroot nor branch\u201d (Malachi 3:16 to 4:1).\nHere are the people that in the world are judged to be greatly\nfavored; but there comes a time when the children of God are distin-\nguished as those who are honored of God because they have honored\nHim.\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon\nus, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world\nknoweth us not, because it knew Him not. Beloved, now are we the\nsons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we\nknow that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall\nsee Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth\nhimself, even as He is pure\u201d (1 John 3:1-3).\nThe Better Way\nWhile temporal honor and riches and power are the great ob-\njects of ambition with the men of this world, the Lord points out\nsomething more worthy of our highest aspirations:\n\u201cThus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,[139]\nShould Christians Be Members of Secret Societies? 135\nneither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man\nglory in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he\nunderstandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nlovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in\nthese things I delight, saith the Lord. Behold, the days come, saith\nthe Lord, that I will punish all them which are circumcised with the\nuncircumcised\u201d (Jeremiah 9:23-25).\n\u201cWherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in\nSion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on\nHim shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe He\nis precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which\nthe builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,\nand a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which\nstumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were\nappointed.

Unbelief has now come to be a fine art which men\nwork at to the destruction of their souls. There is constant danger\nof there being shams in pulpit preachers, whose lives contradict\nthe words they speak; but the voice of warning and of admonition\nwill be heard as long as time shall last; and those who are guilty\nof transactions that should never be entered into, when reproved\nor counseled through the Lord\u2019s appointed agencies, will resist the\nmessage and refuse to be corrected. They will go on as did Pharaoh\nand Nebuchadnezzar, until the Lord takes away their reason, and\ntheir hearts become unimpressible. The Lord\u2019s word will come to\nthem; but if they choose not to hear it, the Lord will make them\nresponsible for their own ruin.\nIn John the Baptist the Lord raised up for Himself a messenger\nto prepare the way of the Lord. He was to bear to the world an\nunflinching testimony in reproving and denouncing sin. Luke, in\nannouncing his mission and work, says, \u201cAnd he shall go before\nHim in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers [148]\nto the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to\nmake ready a people prepared for the Lord\u201d (Luke 1:17).\nMany of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the baptism of\nJohn, and addressing these, he said, \u201cO generation of vipers, who\nhath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth there-\nfore fruits meet for repentance: and think not to say within your-\nselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God\nis able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. And now\nalso the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree\nwhich bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the\nfire. I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but He that\n143\n144 Selected Messages Book 2\ncometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy\nto bear: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:\nwhose fan is in His hand, and He will throughly purge His floor, and\ngather His wheat into the garner; but He will burn up the chaff with\nunquenchable fire\u201d (Matthew 3:7-12).\nThe voice of John was lifted up like a trumpet. His commission\nwas, \u201cShew My people their transgression, and the house of Jacob\ntheir sins\u201d (Isaiah 58:1). He had obtained no human scholarship.\nGod and nature had been his teachers. But one was needed to\nprepare the way before Christ who was bold enough to make his\nvoice heard like the prophets of old, summoning the degenerate\nnation to repentance.\nHeard by All Classes\nAnd all went forth into the wilderness to hear him. Unlearned\nfishermen and peasants came from the surrounding countries and\nfrom regions nigh and afar off. The Roman soldiers from the bar-\nracks of Herod came to hear. Chieftains came with their swords\ngirded by their sides, to put down anything that savored of riot or\nrebellion. The avaricious tax gatherers came from the regions round\nabout; and from the Sanhedrim came forth the phylacteried priests.\nAll listened as if spellbound; and all came away, even the Pharisee,\nthe Sadducee, and the cold, unimpressionable scoffer of the age,[149]\nwith the sneer gone, and cut to the heart with a sense of their sin.\nThere were no long arguments, no finely cut theories, elaborately\ndelivered in their \u201cfirstly,\u201d \u201csecondly,\u201d and \u201cthirdly.\u201d But pure native\neloquence was revealed in the short sentences, every word carrying\nwith it the certainty and truth of the weighty warnings given.\nThe warning message of John was in the same lines as the warn-\ning to Nineveh, \u201cYet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown\u201d\n(Jonah 3:4). Nineveh repented, and called upon God, and God ac-\ncepted their acknowledgment of Him. Forty years of probation was\ngranted them in which to reveal the genuineness of their repentance\nand to turn from sin. But Nineveh turned again to the worship of\nimages; her iniquity became deeper and more desperate than before,\nbecause the light had come and had not been heeded.\nAdmonition Will Be Heard 145\nJohn called every class to repentance. To the Pharisees and\nSadducees he said, Flee from the wrath to come. Your claims to\nAbraham as your father are not of the least value to you. They\nwill not impart to you pure principles and holiness of character.\nCeremonial sacrifices possess no value unless you discern their\nobject, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world. You\nturn from God\u2019s requirements and follow your own perverted ideas;\nand you lose those characteristics which constitute you children of\nAbraham.\nAnd pointing to the rocks in wild confusion around through\nwhich the stream was winding its course, he said, \u201cGod is able of\nthese stones to raise up children unto Abraham\u201d (Matthew 3:9).\nJohn the Baptist met sin with open rebuke in men of humble\noccupation and in men of high degree. He declared the truth to kings\nand nobles, whether they would hear or reject it. He spoke personally\nand pointedly. He reproved the Pharisees of the Sanhedrim because\ntheir religion consisted in forms and not in righteousness of pure,\nwilling obedience.... He spoke to Herod in regard to his marriage\nwith Herodias, saying, It is not lawful for thee to have her. He spoke [150]\nto him of a future retribution, when God would judge every man\naccording to his works....\n\u201cThen came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,\nMaster, what shall we do?\u201d (Luke 3:12). Did he say, Leave your toll\nand custom houses? No, he said to them, \u201cExact no more than that\nwhich is appointed you\u201d (Luke 3:13). If they were taxgatherers still,\nthey could hold just weights and balances of truth in their hands.\nThey could reform in those things that savored of dishonesty and\noppression.\n\u201cAnd the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what\nshall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither\naccuse any falsely; and be content with your wages\u201d (Luke 3:14)....\nThe Sword of Truth at Work\nChrist also spoke pointedly to every class of men. He reproved\nthose who dominated over their fellow men, those whose passions\nand prejudices caused many to err and compelled many to blaspheme\nGod. The sword of truth was blunted by apologies and suppositions;\n146 Selected Messages Book 2\nbut Christ called things by their right names. The ax was laid to the\nroot of the tree. He showed that all the religious forms of worship\ncould not save the Jewish nation, because they did not behold and\nreceive by faith the Lamb of God as their Saviour.\nJust such a work and message as that of John will be carried on\nin these last days. The Lord has been giving messages to His people,\nthrough the instruments He has chosen, and He would have all take\nheed to the admonitions and warnings He sends.\nThe message preceding the public ministry of the Son of God\nwas, Repent, publicans; repent, Pharisees and Sadducees, \u201cfor the\nkingdom of heaven is at hand\u201d (Matthew 3:2). Our message is not\nto be one of \u201cpeace and safety\u201d (1 Thessalonians 5:3). As a people\nwho believe in Christ\u2019s soon appearing, we have a work to do, a\nmessage to bear\u2014\u201cPrepare to meet thy God\u201d (Amos 4:12). We\nare to lift up the standard, and bear the third angel\u2019s message\u2014the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\nThe Message for Today[151]\nThe message we bear must be as direct as was the message of\nJohn. He rebuked kings for their iniquity. He rebuked the adultery\nof Herod. Notwithstanding his life was in peril, the truth did not\nlanguish upon his lips. And our work in this age must be as faithfully\ndone. The inhabitants of the world at this time are represented by\nthe dwellers upon the earth at the time of the Flood. The wickedness\nof the inhabitants of the old world is plainly stated: \u201cAnd God saw\nthat the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every\nimagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually\u201d\n(Genesis 6:5). God became weary of these people whose only\nthoughts were of pleasure and indulgence. They sought not the\ncounsel of the God who had created them, nor cared to do His\nwill. The rebuke of God was upon them because they followed the\nimagination of their own hearts continually; and there was violence\nin the land. \u201cAnd it repented the Lord that he had made man on the\nearth, and it grieved him at his heart.\u201d \u201cAnd God looked upon the\nearth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way\nupon the earth. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is\ncome before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them;\nAdmonition Will Be Heard 147\nand, behold, I will destroy them with the earth\u201d (Genesis 6:6, 12,\n13)....\nThere are special duties to be done, special reproofs to be given in\nthis period of the earth\u2019s history. The Lord will not leave His church\nwithout reproofs and warnings. Sins have become fashionable; but\nthey are none the less aggravating in the sight of God. They are\nglossed over, palliated, and excused; the right hand of fellowship is\ngiven to the very men who are bringing in false theories and false\nsentiments, confusing the minds of the people of God, deadening\ntheir sensibilities as to what constitutes right principles. Conscience\nhas thus become insensible to the counsels and the reproofs which\nhave been given. The light given, calling to repentance, has been\nextinguished in the clouds of unbelief and opposition brought in by\nhuman plans and human inventions.\nIt is living earnestness that God requires. Ministers may have [152]\nlittle learning from books; but if they do the best they can with\ntheir talents, if they work as they have opportunity, if they clothe\ntheir utterances in the plainest and most simple language, if they\nare humble men who walk in carefulness and humility, seeking for\nheavenly wisdom, working for God from the heart, and actuated by\none predominating motive\u2014love for Christ and the souls for whom\nHe has died\u2014they will be listened to by men of even superior ability\nand talents. There will be a charm in the simplicity of the truths they\npresent. Christ is the greatest teacher that the world has ever known.\nJohn had not learned in the schools of the rabbis. Yet kings\nand nobles, Pharisees and Sadducees, Roman soldiers and officers,\ntrained in all court etiquette, wily, calculating taxgatherers, and\nworld-renowned men, listened to his words. They had confidence in\nhis plain statements, and were convicted of sin. They asked of him,\n\u201cWhat shall we do?\u201d (Luke 3:14)....\nEarnestness Is Necessary\nIn this age, just prior to the second coming of Christ in the clouds\nof heaven, the Lord calls for men who will be earnest and prepare\na people to stand in the great day of the Lord. The men who have\nspent long terms in the study of books are not revealing in their\nlives that earnest ministry which is essential for this last time. They\n148 Selected Messages Book 2\ndo not bear a simple, straightforward testimony. Among ministers\nand students there is need of the infusion of the Spirit of God. The\nprayerful, earnest appeals that come from the heart of a whole-souled\nmessenger will create convictions. It will not need the learned men\nto do this; for they depend more on their learning from books than\nupon their knowledge of God and Jesus Christ whom He has sent.\nAll who know the only true and living God will know Jesus Christ,\nthe only-begotten Son of God, and will preach Jesus Christ and Him\ncrucified....\nDoes anyone suppose that the messages of warning will not come\nto those whom God reproves? The ones reproved may rise up in[153]\nindignation and seek to bring the law to bear upon God\u2019s messenger,\nbut in doing this, they are not bringing the law upon the messenger,\nbut upon Christ, who gave the reproof and the warning. When men\nendanger the work and cause of God by their own wrong course\nof action, shall they hear no voice of reproof? If the wrongdoer\nonly were concerned, and the work reached no farther than him, he\nalone should have the words of warning; but when his course of\naction is doing positive harm to the cause of truth, and souls are\nimperiled, God requires that the warning be as broad as the injury\ndone. The testimonies will not be hindered. The words of rebuke\nand warning, the plain \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d will come from God\u2019s\nappointed agencies; for the words do not originate with the human\ninstrument; they are from God, who appointed them their work. If\na suit is instituted in earthly tribunals, and God suffers it to come\nto trial, it is that His own name may be glorified. But a woe will\nbe upon the man who gives himself to do this work. God reads\nthe motives, whatever they may be. I pray that the Lord will teach\nour brethren to be straightforward, and make no compromise in the\nmatter. The cause of God has been bruised and wounded by any\nsuch men connecting with it, and the sooner they are separated from\nit, the better....\nGod calls for men of decided fidelity. He has no use in an\nemergency for two-sided men. He wants men who will lay their\nhand upon a wrong work and say, \u201cThis is not according to the will\nof God.\u201d\u2014Letter 19a, 1897.\nChapter 16\u2014Christ\u2019s Lifework and Ours [154]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Methods, No. 6.]\nWe read of One who walked this earth in meekness and lowli-\nness, who went about \u201cdoing good\u201d (Acts 10:38), who spent His\nlife in loving service, comforting the sorrowing, ministering to the\nneedy, lifting up the bowed down. He had no home in this world,\nonly as the kindness of His friends provided it for Him as a wayfarer.\nYet it was heaven to be in His presence. Day by day He met trials\nand temptations, yet He did not fail or become discouraged. He was\nsurrounded by transgression, yet He kept His Father\u2019s command-\nments. He was always patient and cheerful, and the afflicted hailed\nHim as a messenger of life and peace and health. He saw the needs\nof men and women, and to all He gives the invitation, \u201cCome unto\nme, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\nTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly\nin heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,\nand my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30).\nWhat an example Christ has left us in His lifework! Who of His\nchildren are living as He did, for the glory of God? He is the light\nof the world, and he who works successfully for the Master must [155]\nkindle his taper from His divine life.\nTo His disciples Christ said, \u201cYe are the salt of the earth: but if\nthe salt have lost his savour, ... it is thenceforth good for nothing, but\nto be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men\u201d (Matthew 5:13).\nHow careful then we should be to follow the example of Christ in\nour lifework. Unless we do this, we are worthless to the world\u2014salt\nwhich has lost its savor....\nGod uses a diversity of talents in His cause. He carries on His\nwork for the church by a variety of instruments. No man who desires\nto make of himself the only teacher in the church is working for God.\nNo one who says, \u201cI want my influence only to tell in the church over\nwhich I preside,\u201d is letting his light shine for God. Those who are\n149\n150 Selected Messages Book 2\nuncourteous to their fellow workers must reckon with God. By their\ninfluence they keep out of the church the light which God desires His\npeople to have. They manifest a spirit which God does not endorse.\nChrist the Pattern\nChrist was sent to the world to look after His Father\u2019s interests.\nHe is our pattern in all things. The variety of His teaching is a lesson\nwe need to study.\nAll workers are not alike in their understanding and experience\nor in their administration of the Word. Some are constantly partaking\nof Christ\u2019s flesh and blood. They eat the leaves of the tree of life.\nThey are constant learners in the school of Christ. They make daily\nprogress in goodness, and gain an experience which fits them to labor\nfor the Master. Their influence is a savor of life unto life. So spiritual\nminded are they that they readily discern spiritual things. The Bible\nis their study. Magazines, newspapers, and books which treat of\nnothing heavenly or divine have no attraction for them. But the Word\nof God grows constantly more precious to them. God draws near\nand speaks to them in language which cannot be misunderstood.\nThere are others who have not learned how to fix their minds so[156]\nintently upon the Scriptures that they draw from them each day a\nfresh supply of grace.\nSome men have a special message from heaven. They are to be\nsent forth to waken the people, not to hover over the churches to\ntheir own detriment and the hindrance of the work of God. It does\na church no good to have two or three ministers waiting upon it.\nWere these ministers to go forth to labor for those in darkness, their\nwork would show some results. Let the experienced men take the\nyoung men who are preparing for the ministry and go forth into new\nterritory to proclaim the message of warning.\nThose who believe the truth will be greatly blessed as they impart\nthe blessings God has given them, letting their light shine forth in\ngood works. As they let their light shine by personal piety, by\nrevealing sound principles in all business transactions, they will\nmagnify the principles of God\u2019s law. God calls upon His workers\nto annex new territory for Him. With intense earnestness we are to\nChrist\u2019s Lifework and Ours 151\nwork for those who are without hope and without God in the world.\nThere are rich fields of toil waiting for the faithful worker.\nThe laborers in God\u2019s cause should bow before Him in hum-\nble, earnest prayer, and then go forth, Bible in hand, to arouse the\nbenumbed senses of those represented in the Word as dead in tres-\npasses and sins. Those who do this work will be greatly blessed.\nThose who know the truth are to strengthen one another, saying to\nthe ministers, \u201cGo forth into the harvest field in the name of the\nLord, and our prayers shall go with you as sharp sickles.\u201d Thus our\nchurches should bear decided witness for God, and they should also\nbring Him their gifts and offerings, that those who go forth into the\nfield may have wherewith to labor for souls.\nWho is working faithfully for the Master in this age of the world,\nwhen the corruption of the earth is even as the corruption of Sodom\nand Gomorrah? Who is helping those around him to win eternal\nlife? Are we cleansed and sanctified, fit to be used by the Lord as\nvessels unto honor? Will every church member now remember that [157]\ndeformity is not from God? The Divine Being is to be worshiped in\nthe beauty of holiness; for He is excellent in majesty and power....\nGod desires His people to show by their lives the advantage of\nChristianity over worldliness. We are to live so that God can use\nus in His work of converting men and women and leading them to\nwash their garments of character and make them white in the blood\nof the Lamb. We are His workmanship, \u201ccreated in Christ Jesus unto\ngood works\u201d (Ephesians 2:10). Through us God desires to reveal\nHis manifold wisdom.

Our\nfaith must not stagger, but cleave through that shadow. We have an\nexperience that is not to be buried in the darkness of doubt. Our\nfaith is not in feeling, but in truth. None of us need flatter ourselves\n152 Selected Messages Book 2\nthat while the world is progressing in wickedness we shall have no\ndifficulties.\nIt is these very difficulties that bring us to the audience chamber\nof the Most High, to seek counsel of the One who is infinite in\nwisdom. He loves to have us seek Him; He loves to have us trust\nHim and believe His Word. If we had no perplexities, no trials, we\nwould become self-sufficient and lifted up in ourselves. The true\nsaints will be purified, and made white, and tried.\u2014Letter 58, 1909.\nChapter 17\u2014Unity and Devotion [158]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets,.]\nThe Lord has appointed His work to go forward in missionary\nlines in such a way as to extend the knowledge of the truth for these\nlast days. A deception has certainly been on those who ought to\nhave been wide awake to see the great, grand work to be done by\nthe people who bear God\u2019s sign as represented in Exodus 31:12-18.\nThe Lord desires faithful stewards to measure the fields to be\nworked, and then use wisely His means in advancing the work in\nthese fields. God has a people, and a ministry, who are to cooperate\nwith Him....\nThe Lord will work for His people if they will submit to be\nworked by the Holy Spirit, not thinking that they must work the\nSpirit. \u201cAnd now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee,\nbut to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to love\nHim, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all\nthy soul, to keep the commandments of the Lord, and His statutes,\nwhich I command thee this day for thy good?\u201d (Deuteronomy 10:12,\n13)....\nGod\u2019s ministers have a most solemn, sacred work to do in our\nworld. The end is near. The message of truth must go. As faithful [159]\nshepherds of the flock, God\u2019s servants are to bear a clear, sharp\ntestimony. There is to be no perverting of the truth. Divine grace\nnever leads away from mercy and the love of God. It is the power\nof Satan that does this. When Christ preached, His message was\nlike a sharp, two-edged sword, piercing the consciences of men and\nrevealing their inmost thoughts. The work that Christ did His faithful\nmessengers will have to do. In simplicity, purity, and the strictest\nintegrity they are to preach the Word. Those who labor in word or\ndoctrine are to be faithful to their charge. They are to watch for souls\nas they that must give an account. Never are they to clothe a \u201cThus\nsaith the Lord\u201d with enticing words of man\u2019s wisdom. Thus they\n153\n154 Selected Messages Book 2\ndestroy its living energy, making it weak and powerless, so that it\nfails to convict of sin. Every word spoken by the direction of the\nHoly Spirit will be full of the deepest solicitude for the salvation of\nsouls.\nThe minister\u2019s acceptance with God depends not on outward\nshow, but on his faithful discharge of duty. Christ\u2019s road to exaltation\nlay through the deepest humiliation. Those who are partakers with\nChrist in His sufferings, who follow cheerfully in His footsteps, will\nbe partakers with Him in His glory.\nIt has been the continual endeavor of the enemy to introduce into\nthe church persons who assent to much that is truth, but who are not\nconverted. Professed Christians who are false to their trust are chan-\nnels through whom Satan works. He can use unconverted church\nmembers to advance his own ideas and retard the work of God. Their\ninfluence is always on the side of wrong. They place criticism and\ndoubt as stumbling blocks in the way of reform. They introduce\nunbelief because they have closed their eyes to the righteousness of\nChrist and have not the glory of the Lord as their rearward.\nUnity is the strength of the church. Satan knows this, and he\nemploys his whole force to bring in dissension. He desires to see a\nlack of harmony among the members of the church of God. Greater\nattention should be given to the subject of unity. What is the recipe[160]\nfor the cure of the leprosy of strife and dissension? Obedience to the\ncommandments of God.\nGod has been teaching me that we are not to dwell upon the\ndifferences which weaken the church. He prescribes a remedy\nfor strife. By keeping His Sabbath holy we are to show that we\nare His people. His Word declares the Sabbath to be a sign by\nwhich to distinguish the commandment-keeping people. Thus God\u2019s\npeople are to preserve among them a knowledge of Him as their\nCreator. Those who keep the law of God will be one with Him in the\ngreat controversy commenced in heaven between Satan and God.\nDisloyalty to God means contention and strife against the principles\nof God\u2019s law.\nEverything connected with the cause of God is sacred, and is to\nbe thus regarded by His people. The counsels that have any reference\nto the cause of God are sacred. Christ gave His life to bring a sinful\nworld to repentance. Those who are imbued with the spirit that dwelt\nUnity and Devotion 155\nin Christ will work as God\u2019s husbandmen in caring for His vineyard.\nThey will not merely work in spots which they may choose. They\nare to be wise managers and faithful workers, making it their highest\naim to fulfill the commission which Christ has given. Just before His\nascension the Saviour told His disciples that beginning at Jerusalem\nthey must go to all nations, kindreds, tongues, and peoples; and He\nadded, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world\u201d\n(Matthew 28:20).\u2014Manuscript 14, 1901.\nThe Ministry of Trials\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 7.]\nIn Christian experience, the Lord permits trials of various kinds\nto call men and women to a higher order of living and to a more\nsanctified service. Without these trials there would be a continual\nfalling away from the likeness of Christ, and men would become\nimbued with a spirit of scientific, fanciful, human philosophy, which\nwould lead them to unite with Satan\u2019s followers.\nIn the providence of God, every good and great enterprise is [161]\nsubjected to trials, to test the purity and the strength of the principles\nof those who are standing in positions of responsibility, and to mold\nand substantiate the individual human character after God\u2019s model.\nThis is the highest order of education.\nPerfection of character is attained through exercise of the fac-\nulties of the mind, in times of supreme test, by obedience to every\nrequirement of God\u2019s law. Men in positions of trust are to be in-\nstrumentalities in the hands of God for promoting His glory, and in\nperforming their duties with the utmost faithfulness they may attain\nperfection of character.\nIn the lives of those who are true to right principles, there will\nbe a continual growth in knowledge. They will have the privilege of\nbeing acknowledged as colaborers with the great Master Worker in\nbehalf of the human family, and will act a glorious part in carrying\nout the purposes of God.

It is a time when God is testing and proving His people.\nEverything that can be shaken will be shaken. Only those will stand\nwhose souls are riveted to the eternal Rock. Those who lean to their\nown understanding, those who are not constantly abiding in Christ,\nwill be subject to just such changes as this. If your faith has been\ngrounded in man, we may then expect just such results.\nBut if you have decided to cut all connection with us as a people,\nI have one request to make, for your own sake as well as for Christ\u2019s\nsake: keep away from our people, do not visit them and talk your\ndoubts and darkness among them. Satan is full of exultant joy that\nyou have stepped from beneath the banner of Jesus Christ, and stand[163]\nunder his banner. He sees in you one he can make a valuable agent\nto build up his kingdom. You are taking the very course I expected\nyou would take if you yielded to temptation.\nYou have ever had a desire for power, for popularity, and this\nis one of the reasons for your present position. But I beg of you to\nkeep your doubts, your questionings, your skepticism to yourself.\nThe people have given you credit for more strength of purpose and\n156\nAppeal to D. M. Canright 157\nstability of character than you possessed. They thought you were\na strong man; and when you breathe out your dark thoughts and\nfeelings, Satan stands ready to make these thoughts and feelings so\nintensely powerful in their deceptive character, that many souls will\nbe deceived and lost through the influence of one soul who chose\ndarkness rather than light, and presumptuously placed himself on\nSatan\u2019s side, in the ranks of the enemy.\nYou have wanted to be too much, and make a show and noise\nin the world, and as the result your sun will surely set in obscurity.\nEvery day you are meeting with an eternal loss. The schoolboy who\nplays truant thinks he is cheating his parent and his teacher; but\nwho is meeting with the greatest loss? Is it not himself? Is he not\ncheating and deceiving himself, robbing himself of the knowledge\nhe might have? God would have us become efficient in copying\nthe example of Christ in good works; but you are playing truant,\nyou are nursing a feeling which will sting and poison your soul to\nits own ruin, playing truant upon important eternal things, robbing\nyour soul of the richness, the knowledge of the fullness of Christ.\nYour ambition has soared so high, it will accept of nothing short of\nelevation of self. You do not know yourself. What you have always\nneeded was a humble, contrite heart.\nChrist the Pattern Man\nWhat a life was that of Christ? He was just as certainly fulfilling\nHis mission as the pattern man when toiling as a carpenter, and\nhiding the great secret of His divine mission from the world, as when [164]\nHe trod the foaming white-capped billows on the Sea of Galilee, or\nwhen raising the dead to life, or when dying [as] man\u2019s sacrifice upon\nthe cross, that He might lift up the whole race to a new and perfect\nlife. Jesus dwelt long at Nazareth, unhonored and unknown, that the\nlesson in His example might teach men and women how closely they\nmay walk with God in even the common course of daily life. How\nhumiliating, how rude and homely, was this condescension of the\nMajesty of heaven, that He might be made one of us. He drew the\nsympathy of all hearts by showing Himself capable of sympathizing\nwith all. The men of Nazareth in their questioning doubts asked, \u201cIs\nnot this the carpenter\u201d (Mark 6:3), the son of Joseph and Mary?\n158 Selected Messages Book 2\nHeaven and earth are no wider apart today than when common\nmen of common occupation met angels at noonday, or when on\nBethlehem\u2019s plains shepherds heard the songs of the heavenly host\nas they watched their flocks by night. It is not the seeking to climb\nto eminence that will make you great in God\u2019s sight, but it is the\nhumble life of goodness, of fidelity, that will make you the object of\nthe heavenly angels\u2019 special guardianship. The Pattern Man, who\nthought it not robbery to be equal with God, took upon Himself\nour nature, and lived nearly thirty years in an obscure Galilean\ntown, hidden away among the hills. All the angel host was at His\ncommand, yet He did not claim to be anything great or exalted. He\ndid not attach \u201cProfessor\u201d to His name to please Himself. He was\na carpenter, working for wages, a servant to those for whom He\nlabored, showing that heaven may be very near us in the common\nwalks of life, and that angels from the heavenly courts will take\ncharge of the steps of those who come and go at God\u2019s command.\nOh, that the spirit of Christ might rest upon His professed fol-\nlowers! We must all be willing to work and toil, for this is the lesson\nChrist has given us in His life. If you had lived for God in com-\nmon things, doing your work purely and faithfully when there was\nno one to say it was well done, you would not be in your present\nposition. Your life you could make faithful by good words wisely[165]\nspoken, by kind deeds thoughtfully done, by the daily manifestation\nof meekness, purity, and love. In view of all the light you have had,\nI fear you have made your final move. You have given Satan every\nadvantage.\nHasty Decisions\nDecisions may be made in a moment that fix one\u2019s condition\nforever. Satan has come to you as he came to Christ, with the pre-\nsentation of worldly honor and glory, if you will only acknowledge\nhis supremacy. This you are now doing. But before you take one\nmore step, I beseech you to reflect.\nWhat record are angels making in regard to you? How will you\nmeet that record? What excuse will you render to God for the abrupt\napostasy? There has ever been with you a desire to do a large work.\nHad you been content to do your small work with thoroughness and\nAppeal to D. M. Canright 159\nfidelity, this would meet the approval of the Master. But remember,\nit would take the work of a lifetime to recover what a moment of\nyielding to temptation and thoughtlessness throws away.\nWe are traveling, strangers and pilgrims, traveling to a better\ncountry; but it would be better for you and me to be beasts of burden\nto plow the field rather than to be in heaven without a heart to\nsympathize with its inhabitants. By a momentary act of will you\nmay place yourself in the power of Satan, but it will require more\nthan a momentary act of will to break his fetters and reach for a\nhigher, holier life. The purpose may be formed, the work begun,\nbut its accomplishment will require toil, time, and perseverance,\npatience and sacrifice. The man who deliberately wanders from God\nin the full blaze of light will find, when he wishes to set his face\nto return, that briers and thorns have grown up in his path, and he\nmust not be surprised or discouraged if he is compelled to travel\nlong with torn and bleeding feet. The most fearful and most to be\ndreaded evidence of man\u2019s fall from a better state is the fact that it\ncosts so much to get back. The way of return can be gained only by\nhard fighting, inch by inch, every hour.\nHeaven\u2019s path is too narrow for rank and riches to ride in state, [166]\ntoo narrow for the play of ambition, too steep and rugged for car-\nriages of ease to climb. Toil, patience, self-sacrifice, reproach,\npoverty, hard work, enduring the contradiction of sinners against\nHimself, was the portion of Christ, and it must be the portion of man\nif he ever enters the Paradise of God.\nIf your present faith is yielded so easily, it is because you never\nsent down the taproot in clinging faith. It has cost you too little. If\nit does not sustain you in trial and comfort you in affliction, it is\nbecause your faith has not been made strong by effort and pure by\nsacrifice. Those who are willing to suffer for Christ will experience\nmore joy in suffering than in the fact that Christ has suffered for\nthem, thus showing that He loved them. Those who win heaven will\nput forth their noblest efforts, and will labor with all long-suffering,\nthat they may reap the fruit of toil.\nThere is a hand that will open wide the gates of Paradise to those\nthat have stood the test of temptation and kept a good conscience by\ngiving up the world, its honors, its applause, for the love of Christ,\n160 Selected Messages Book 2\nthus confessing Him before men, and waiting with all patience for\nHim to confess them before His Father and holy angels.\nThe Influence of Doubt\nI do not ask an explanation of your course. Brother [C. W.]\nStone wished to read your letter to me. I refused to hear it. The\nbreath of doubt, of complaint and unbelief, is contagious; if I make\nmy mind a channel for the filthy stream, the turbid, defiling water\nproceeding from Satan\u2019s fountain, some suggestion may linger in\nmy mind, polluting it. If his suggestions have had such power on\nyou as to lead you to sell your birthright for a mess of pottage\u2014the\nfriendship of the Lord\u2019s enemies\u2014I want not to hear anything of\nyour doubts, and I hope you will be guarded, lest you contaminate\nother minds; for the very atmosphere surrounding a man who dares\nto make the statements you have made is as a poisonous miasma.\nI beg of you to go entirely away from those who believe the[167]\ntruth; for if you have chosen the world and the friends of the world,\ngo with those of your own choice. Do not poison the minds of others\nand make yourself Satan\u2019s special agent to work the ruin of souls. If\nyou have not fully taken your stand, make haste to resist the devil\nbefore it shall be forever too late. Do not take another step into\ndarkness, but take your position as a man of God.\nIf you would secure the grand aim and purpose of life without\nmistake in your choice or fear of failure, you must make God first\nand last and best in every plan and work and thought. If you want a\npath that leads straight into darkness, you have only to cast the light\nof God behind you, live without God. When God points out your\npath and says, \u201cThis is your way of safety and peace,\u201d You have only\nto set your face in an opposite direction from the way of the Lord\nand your feet will take hold on perdition. The voice of the Lamb of\nGod is heard speaking to us, \u201cFollow Me, and ye shall not walk in\ndarkness.\u201d\nA Commission From the King of Kings\nGod has chosen you for a great and solemn work. He has been\nseeking to discipline, to test, to prove you, to refine and ennoble you,\nthat this sacred work may be done with a single eye to His glory\nAppeal to D. M. Canright 161\nwhich belongs wholly to God. What a thought that God chooses a\nman and brings him into close connection with Himself, and gives\nhim a mission to undertake, a work to do, for Him. A weak man is\nmade strong, a timid man is made brave, the irresolute becomes a\nman of firm and quick decision. What! Is it possible that man is of\nso much consequence as to receive a commission from the King of\nkings! Shall worldly ambition allure from the sacred trust, the holy\ncommission?\nThe Majesty of heaven came to our world to give to man an\nexample of a pure and spotless life, and to sacrifice Himself to the\njoy of saving the perishing. Whoever follows Christ is a colaborer\nwith Him, sharing with Him the divine work of saving souls. If\nyou have a thought of being released from it because you see some\nprospect of forming an alliance with the world which shall bring [168]\nyourself to greater notice, it is because you forget how great and\nnoble it is to do anything for God, how exalted a position it is to be\na colaborer with Jesus Christ, a light bearer to the world, shedding\nlight and love upon the pathway of others.\nReward of Fidelity\nYou will have a great conflict with the power of evil in your own\nheart. You have felt that there was a higher work for you, but, oh, if\nyou would only take up the work lying directly in your path, and do\nit with fidelity, not seeking in any way to exalt self, the peace and\njoy would come to your soul, purer, richer, and more satisfying than\nthe conquerors in earthly warfare. To live and work for God and\nmake the best use we can of all our time and faculties, is to grow in\ngrace and knowledge. This we can do, because it is our work. You\nmust needs put away your questioning doubts, and have full faith in\nthe reality of your divine mission, to be indeed successful in labor.\nThe joy, the success, the glory of your ministry, is to be ever\nready with listening ear to answer the call of the Master, \u201cHere am I;\nsend me\u201d (Isaiah 6:8). Here, Lord, with my heart\u2019s best and holiest\naffections; here, take my mind with its purest and noblest thoughts,\ntake me, and qualify me for Thy service.\nI now appeal to you to make back tracks as fast as possible;\ntake up your God-given mission, and seek for purity and holiness to\n162 Selected Messages Book 2\nsanctify that mission. Make no delay; halt not between two opinions.\nIf the Lord be God, serve Him; but if Baal, serve him. You have\nthe old lesson of trust in God to learn anew in the hard school of\nsuffering. Let D.M. Canright be swallowed up in Jesus....\nOur names may be called in a little while, and there will be none\nto answer. Let that life be hid in God, and that name be registered in\nheaven, and it is immortalized. Follow on wherever Christ leads the\nway, and let the footprints which you leave behind you on the sands\nof time be such that others may safely follow in the path of holiness.\nAll along the path that leads to death there are pains and penalties,[169]\nthere are sorrows and disappointments, there are warnings from\nGod\u2019s messengers not to go on, and God will make it hard for the\nheedless and the headstrong to destroy themselves. All the way\nup the steep path leading to eternal life are wellsprings of joy to\nrefresh the weary. The true, strong joy of the soul begins when\nChrist is formed within, the hope of glory. If you now choose the\npath where God leads, and go forward where the voice of duty calls,\nthe difficulties which Satan has magnified before you will disappear.\nNo path is safe, save that which grows clearer and firmer the\nfarther it is pursued. The foot may sometimes slip upon the safest\npath. In order to walk without fear, you must know that your hand\nis firmly held by the hand of Christ. You must not for a moment\nthink there is no danger for you. The wisest make mistakes. The\nstrongest sometimes falter. The foolish, self-confident, heady, and\nhigh-minded, who press heedlessly on upon forbidden paths, flatter-\ning themselves that they can change their course when they please,\nare walking upon a path of pitfalls. They may recover a fall, a mis-\ntake they make, but how many make one misstep which will prove\ntheir eternal ruin.\nIf you play the policy of noncommittal in order to gain objects\nyou would otherwise fail to obtain, if you secure by art and cunning\nwhat should be won by perseverance, toil, and conflict, you will be\nentangled in a net of your own weaving, and will be ruined, not only\nfor this world, but for the future life.\nGod forbid that you should make shipwreck of faith here. Look\nat Paul; listen to his words sounding along the line to our time: \u201cI\nhave fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the\nfaith: henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,\nAppeal to D. M. Canright 163\nwhich the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: and\nnot to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing\u201d (2\nTimothy 4:7, 8). Here is the battle shout of victory from Paul. What\nwill be yours?\nNow, Elder Canright, for your soul\u2019s sake grasp firmly again the [170]\nhand of God, I beseech you. I am too weary to write more. God\ndeliver you from Satan\u2019s snare is my prayer.\u2014Letter 1, 1880.\nExalting Christ\nEvery soul who truly accepts Christ by faith will walk in humility\nof heart. There will be no exalting of self; but Christ will be exalted\nas the One on whom the hope of eternal life depends. \u201cBy grace are\nye saved through faith\u201d (Ephesians 2:8), the apostle Paul declared.\nAnd it is the grace of Christ in us that makes us His witnesses. We\ncan be overcomers only by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word\nof our testimony. By a well-ordered life and a godly conversation,\nwe become lights in the church and in the world. Spiritual things\nmust be spiritually discerned. Those who drink most deeply of the\nwaters of salvation will reveal most fully the meekness and lowliness\nof Christ.\nI am bidden to say to those who have been called to teach the\nWord of God to others:\nNever encourage men to look to you for wisdom. When men\ncome to you for counsel, point them to the One who reads the mo-\ntives of every heart. A different spirit must come into our ministerial\nwork. No persons must act as confessors; no man must be exalted\nas supreme. Our work is to humble self and to exalt Christ before\nthe people. After His resurrection, the Saviour promised that His\npower would be with all who would go forth in His name. Let this\npower and this name be exalted. We need to keep continually before\nour minds the prayer of Christ when He prayed that self might be\nsanctified by truth and righteousness.\nThe power of the eternal Father and the sacrifice of the Son\nshould be studied more than it is. The perfect work of Christ was\nconsummated in His death upon the cross. In His sacrifice and\nHis intercession at the right hand of the Father, is our only hope of\nsalvation. It should be our joy to exalt the character of God before\n164 Selected Messages Book 2\nmen, and make His name a praise in the earth.\u2014Manuscript 137,\n1907.\nSection 5\u2014The Remuneration of Our [171]\n[172]Workers\nIntroduction\nRemuneration for services rendered is a subject of constant and\npractical interest to everyone. It is a topic well represented in several\ncurrent Ellen G. White books.\nPresented here are supplementary counsels that were drawn to-\ngether for the study of certain committees appointed by the General\nConference to review the principles that should govern in the remu-\nneration of Seventh-day Adventist workers. This material proved\nto be helpful to the committees, and at their suggestion it is being\nincluded here.\nThe review of these and other principles, drawn from various\ndocuments and counsels given regarding the relationship of Seventh-\nday Adventist workers to the organizations with which they are\nconnected, will be read with profit.\nAnd to any who may be tempted, because of financial pressures,\nto accept an inviting offer of a larger income in lines of work not\ndirectly connected with the cause of God, the chapter, \u201ccounsel to\none who for financial reasons, was planning to leave the work of\nGod,\u201d will offer challenging and sobering thoughts. In all these\nEllen G. White messages the spirit of Christ, which is the spirit of\nsacrifice, is the keynote.\nWhite Trustees.\n[Appeared in The Review and Herald, January 4, 1906.]\n166\nChapter 19\u2014An Object Lesson [173]\nThe beginnings of Solomon\u2019s apostasy may be traced to many\nseemingly slight deviations from right principles. Associations with\nidolatrous women was by no means the only cause of his downfall.\nAmong the primary causes that led Solomon into extravagance and\ntyrannical oppression, was his course in developing and cherishing\na spirit of covetousness.\nIn the days of ancient Israel, when at the foot of Sinai Moses told\nthe people of the divine command, \u201cLet them make me a sanctuary;\nthat I may dwell among them\u201d (Exodus 25:8), the response of the\nIsraelites was accompanied by appropriate gifts. \u201cThey came, every\none whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made\nwilling\u201d (Exodus 35:21), and brought offerings. For the building of\nthe sanctuary, great and expensive preparations were necessary; a\nlarge amount of the most precious and costly material was required;\nyet the Lord accepted only freewill offerings. \u201cOf every man that\ngiveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take My offering\u201d (Exodus\n25:2), was the divine command repeated by Moses to the congrega-\ntion. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites [174]\nin preparing a dwelling place for the Most High.\nA similar call to self-sacrifice was made when David turned\nover to Solomon the responsibility of erecting the temple. Of the\nassembled multitude that had brought their liberal gifts, David asked,\n\u201cWho then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the\nLord?\u201d (1 Chronicles 29:5). This call should ever have been kept in\nmind by those who had to do with the construction of the temple.\nChosen men were specially endowed by God with skill and\nwisdom for the construction of the wilderness tabernacle. \u201cMoses\nsaid unto the children of Israel, See, the Lord hath called by name\nBezaleel ... of the tribe of Judah; and he hath filled him with the\nSpirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and\nin all manner of workmanship.... And he hath put in his heart that he\nmay teach, both he, and Aholiab ... of the tribe of Dan. Them hath\n167\n168 Selected Messages Book 2\nhe filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the\nengraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer ...\nand of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that\ndevise cunning work\u201d (Exodus 35:30-35). \u201cThen wrought Bezaleel\n... and every wise hearted man, in whom the Lord put wisdom and\nunderstanding\u201d (Exodus 36:1). Heavenly intelligences cooperated\nwith the workmen whom God Himself chose.\nThe descendants of these men inherited to a large degree the\nskill conferred upon their forefathers. In the tribes of Judah and of\nDan there were men who were regarded as especially \u201ccunning\u201d in\nthe finer arts. For a time these men remained humble and unselfish;\nbut gradually, almost imperceptibly, they lost their hold upon God\nand His truth. They began to ask for higher wages because of their\nsuperior skill. In some instances their request was granted, but\nmore often those asking higher wages found employment in the\nsurrounding nations. In place of the noble spirit of self-sacrifice\nthat had filled the hearts of their illustrious ancestors, they cherished\na spirit of covetousness, of grasping for more and more. They\nserved heathen kings with their God-given skill, and dishonored[175]\ntheir Maker.\nUnbelieving Workmen Employed\nIt was to these apostates that Solomon looked for a master work-\nman to superintend the construction of the temple on Mount Moriah.\nMinute specifications, in writing, regarding every portion of the\nsacred structure, had been entrusted to the king, and he should have\nlooked to God in faith for consecrated helpers, to whom would have\nbeen granted special skill for doing with exactness the work required.\nBut Solomon lost sight of this opportunity to exercise faith in God.\nHe sent to the king of Tyre for \u201ca man cunning to work in gold, and\nin silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and\nblue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men ... In Judah\nand in Jerusalem\u201d (2 Chronicles 2:7).\nThe Phoenician king responded by sending Huram, \u201ca cunning\nman, endued with understanding, ... The son of a woman of the\ndaughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre\u201d (2 Chronicles\n2:13, 14). This master workman, Huram, was a descendant, on his\nObject Lesson 169\nmother\u2019s side, of Aholiab, to whom, hundreds of years before, God\nhad given special wisdom for the construction of the tabernacle.\nThus at the head of Solomon\u2019s company of workmen there was\nplaced an unsanctified man, who demanded large wages because of\nhis unusual skill.\nHuram\u2019s efforts were not prompted by a desire to render his\nhighest service to God. He served the god of this world\u2014Mammon.\nThe very fibers of his being had been inwrought with principles\nof selfishness, which were revealed in his grasping for the highest\nwages. And gradually these wrong principles came to be cherished\nby his associates. As they labored with him day after day, and\nyielded to the inclination to compare his wages with their own, they\nbegan to lose sight of the holy character of their work, and to dwell\nupon the difference between their wages and his. Gradually they\nlost their spirit of self-denial, and fostered a spirit of covetousness.\nThe result was a demand for higher wages, which was granted them. [176]\nThe baleful influences set in operation by the employment of\nthis man of a grasping spirit, permeated all branches of the Lord\u2019s\nservice, and extended throughout Solomon\u2019s kingdom. The high\nwages demanded and received gave many an opportunity to indulge\nin luxury and extravagance. In the far-reaching effects of these\ninfluences, may be traced one of the principal causes of the terrible\napostasy of him who once was the wisest of mortals. The king was\nnot alone in his apostasy. Extravagance and corruption were to be\nseen on every hand. The poor were oppressed by the rich; the spirit\nof self-sacrifice in God\u2019s service was well-nigh lost.\nHerein lies a most important lesson for God\u2019s people today\u2014a\nlesson that many are slow to learn. The spirit of covetousness, of\nseeking for the highest position and the highest wage, is rife in the\nworld. The old-time spirit of self-denial and self-sacrifice is too\nseldom met with. But this is the only spirit that can actuate a true\nfollower of Jesus. Our divine Master has given us an example of\nhow we are to work. And to those whom He bade, \u201cFollow me,\nand I will make you fishers of men\u201d (Matthew 4:19), He offered no\nstated sum as a reward for their services. They were to share with\nHim His self-denial and sacrifice.\nThose who claim to be followers of the Master Worker, and who\nengage in His service as colaborers with God, are to bring into their\n170 Selected Messages Book 2\nwork the exactitude and skill, the tact and wisdom, that the God of\nperfection required in the building of the earthly tabernacle. And\nnow, as in that time and as in the days of Christ\u2019s earthly ministry,\ndevotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice should be regarded as the\nfirst requisites of acceptable service. God designs that not one thread\nof selfishness shall be woven into His work.\nAn Experience in Seventh-day Adventist History\nGreat care should be taken in regard to the spirit pervading the\nLord\u2019s institutions. These institutions were founded in self-sacrifice,\nand have been built up by the self-denying gifts of God\u2019s people\nand the unselfish labor of His servants. Everything connected with[177]\ninstitutional service should bear the signature of Heaven. A sense\nof the sacredness of God\u2019s institutions should be encouraged and\ncultivated. The workers are to humble their hearts before the Lord,\nacknowledging His sovereignty. All are to live in accordance with\nprinciples of self-denial. As the true, self-sacrificing laborer, with his\nspiritual lamp trimmed and burning, strives unselfishly to advance\nthe interests of the institution in which he is working, he will have\na precious experience, and will be able to say, \u201cThe Lord indeed\nis in this place.\u201d He will feel that he is highly privileged in being\npermitted to give to the Lord\u2019s institution his ability, his service, and\nhis unwearying vigilance.\nIn the early days of the third angel\u2019s message those who estab-\nlished our institutions, and those who labored in them, were actuated\nby high motives of unselfishness. For their arduous labors they re-\nceived no more than a mere pittance\u2014barely enough for a meager\nsupport. But their hearts were baptized with the ministry of love.\nThe reward of whole-souled liberality was apparent in their close\nfellowship with the Spirit of the Master Worker. They practiced the\nclosest economy, in order that as many other laborers as possible\nmight be planting the standard of truth in new places.\nBut in time a change came. The spirit of sacrifice was not so\nmanifest. In some of our institutions the wages of a few workers\nwere increased beyond reason. Those who received these wages\nclaimed that they deserved a greater sum than others, because of their\nsuperior talents. But who gave them their talents, their ability? With\nObject Lesson 171\nthe increase of wages came a steady increase of covetousness, which\nis idolatry, and a steady decline of spirituality. Gross evils crept\nin, and God was dishonored. The minds of many who witnessed\nthis grasping after higher and still higher wages, were leavened with\ndoubt and unbelief. Strange principles, like evil leaven, permeated\nnearly the entire body of believers. Many ceased to deny self, and\nnot a few withheld their tithes and offerings.\nGod in His providence called for a reform in His sacred work, [178]\nwhich should begin at the heart, and work outwardly. Some who\nblindly continued to place a high estimate upon their services, were\nremoved. Others received the message given to them, turned to\nGod with full purpose of heart, and learned to abhor their covetous\nspirit. So far as possible, they endeavored to set a right example\nbefore the people by voluntarily reducing their wages. They realized\nthat nothing less than complete transformation in mind and heart\nwould save them from being swept off their feet by some masterly\ntemptation.\nA Threat to Aggressive Denominational Work\nThe work of God in all its wide extent is one, and the same prin-\nciples should control, the same spirit be revealed, in all its branches.\nIt must bear the stamp of missionary work. Every department of\nthe cause is related to all parts of the gospel field, and the spirit that\ncontrols one department will be felt throughout the entire field. If a\nportion of the workers receive large wages, there are others, in dif-\nferent branches of the work, who will call for higher wages, and the\nspirit of self-sacrifice will gradually be lost sight of. Other institu-\ntions and conferences will catch the same spirit, and the Lord\u2019s favor\nwill be removed from them; for He can never sanction selfishness.\nThus our aggressive work would come to an end. Only by constant\nsacrifice can it be carried forward.\nGod will test the faith of every soul. Christ has purchased us at an\ninfinite sacrifice. Although He was rich, yet for our sake He became\npoor, that we through His poverty might come into possession of\neternal riches. All that we possess of ability and intellect has been\nlent us in trust by the Lord, to use for Him. It is our privilege to be\npartakers with Christ in His sacrifice.\nChapter 20\u2014General Principles Governing Worker[179]\nRemuneration\nSatisfaction and Blessing in Sacrificial Labor\nThose who have the cause of God at heart, must realize that they\nare not working for themselves or for the small wage they may be\nreceiving, and that God can make the little they do receive go farther\nthan they think it can. He will give them satisfaction and blessing as\nthey go forward in self-sacrificing labor. And He will bless every\none of us as we labor in the meekness of Christ. And when I see\nsome seeking for higher wages, I say to myself, \u201cThey are losing a\nprecious blessing.\u201d I know this to be a fact. I have seen it worked\nout again and again.\nNow, brethren, let us take hold and do the very best that we\npossibly can, without asking for higher wages except as we find that\nit is an impossibility to do the work given us without more; but even\nthen let others see this necessity as well as ourselves, for God puts it\ninto their heart to see it, and they will speak the word that will have\nmore influence than for us to speak a thousand words. They will\nspeak words that will give us a proper standing before the people.\nThe Lord is our helper and God, our front guard and our rearward.\nAs we bring ourselves into right relationship with God, we shall\nhave success wherever we go; and it is success that we want, not[180]\nmoney\u2014living success, and God will give it to us because He knows\nall about our self-denial. He knows every sacrifice that we make.\nYou may think that your self-denial does not make any difference,\nthat you ought to have more consideration and so on. But it makes\na great difference with the Lord. Over and over again I have been\nshown that when individuals begin to reach out after higher and still\nhigher wages, something comes into their experience that places\nthem where they stand no longer on vantage ground. But when they\ntake the wage that carries on the face of it the fact that they are self-\nsacrificing, the Lord sees their self-denial and He gives them success\n172\nGeneral Principles Governing Worker Remuneration 173\nand victory. This has been presented to me over and over again.\nThe Lord that seeth in secret will reward openly for every sacrifice\nthat His tried servants have been willing to make.\u2014Manuscript 12,\n1913.\nNot to Demand a Stipulated Sum\nChrist gives to all the invitation, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that\nlabour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke\nupon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and\nye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my\nburden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:28-30). If all will wear Christ\u2019s yoke,\nif all will learn in His school the lessons that He teaches, there will\nbe sufficient means to establish gospel medical missionary work in\nmany places.\nLet none say, \u201cI will engage in this work for a stipulated sum. If\nI do not receive this sum, I will not do the work.\u201d Those who say this\nshow that they are not wearing Christ\u2019s yoke; they are not learning\nHis meekness and lowliness....\nIt is not being rich in the wealth of the world that increases our\nvalue in God\u2019s sight. It is the meek and the contrite that the Lord\nacknowledges and honors. Read the fifty-seventh chapter of Isaiah.\nStudy this chapter carefully; for it means much to the people of God.\nI will make no comments upon it.\u2014Letter 145, 1904.\nDo the Work and Accept Wages Offered [181]\nEvery man is required to do the work assigned him of God. We\nshould be willing to render small services, doing the things that are to\nbe done, which someone must do, improving the little opportunities.\nIf these are the only opportunities we should still work faithfully.\nHe who wastes hours, days, and weeks, because he is unwilling to\ndo the work that offers, humble though it may be, will be called to\nrender an account to God for his misspent time. If he feels that he\ncan afford to do nothing, because he cannot obtain the desired wages,\nlet him stop and think that that day, that one day, is the Lord\u2019s. He\nis the Lord\u2019s servant. He is not to waste his time. Let him think, \u201cI\n174 Selected Messages Book 2\nwill spend that time in doing something, and will give all I earn to\nadvance the work of God. I will not be counted a do-nothing.\u201d\nWhen a man loves God supremely, and his neighbor as himself,\nhe will not stop to inquire whether that which he can do is bringing\nin much or little. He will do the work, and accept the wages offered.\nHe will not set the example of refusing a job because he cannot\ncount upon as large wages as he thinks he should have.\nThe Lord judges a man\u2019s character by the principles on which\nhe acts in dealing with his fellow men. If in common business\ntransactions his principles are defective, the same will be brought\ninto his spiritual service for God. The threads are woven into his\nwhole religious life. If you have too much dignity to work for\nyourself for small wages, then work for the Master; give the proceeds\ninto the Lord\u2019s treasury. Make an offering of gratitude to God for\nsparing your life. But do not on any account be idle.\u2014Manuscript\n156, 1897.\nPay to Be According to Labor\nThe ways of the Lord are just and equal. The workers in the\nschool should receive according to the hours they give to the school\nin honest, hard labor. Injustice must not be done to any worker. If\none man or woman gives to the school full time, he is to receive from[182]\nthe school according to the time which the school receives from him.\nIf one gives mind, toil, and strength in bearing the burdens, he is to\nreceive according to the value he gives to the school. Justice and truth\nare to be maintained, not only for the present and future standing of\nthe school, but for our own individual benefit in righteousness. The\nLord will not be a party to the least injustice.\u2014Manuscript 69, 1898.\nPrivilege of Working Versus Wages\nThose who think more of their wages than of the privilege of\nbeing honored as a servant of the Lord, who take up their work in\na self-congratulatory spirit because they are to receive wages, do\nnot bring self-denial and self-sacrifice into their work. The last men\nhired believed the word of the householder, \u201cWhatsoever is right,\nthat shall ye receive\u201d (Matthew 20:7). They knew that they would\nGeneral Principles Governing Worker Remuneration 175\nreceive all that they deserved, and they were placed first because\nthey brought faith into their work. If those who had labored during\nthe whole day had brought a loving, trusting spirit into their work,\nthey would have continued to be first.\nThe Lord Jesus estimates the work done by the spirit in which it\nis done. At a late hour He will accept penitent sinners who come to\nHim in humble faith and are obedient to His commandments.\nChrist warns those in His service that they are not to bargain\nfor a stipulated sum, as though their Master would not deal truly\nwith them. He gave this parable that murmurers would not receive\nsympathy on account of their supposed grievances.\u2014Manuscript 87,\n1899.\nTrue prosperity can never come to the soul that is constantly\naspiring to get higher wages, and who yields to the temptation that\nleads him away from the work that God has appointed him. There\nnever can be prosperity for any man, or any family, or any firm\nor institution, unless the wisdom of God presides.\u2014Letter 2, 1898\n(Tract To the Leading Men of Our Churches, 4.).\n\u201cAn Expensive Family\u201d [183]\nMen have written to me saying that they must have high wages,\nand pleading as an excuse an expensive family. And at the same\ntime the institution with which they were connected was obliged to\nfigure closely to meet running expenses. Why should anyone plead\nan expensive family as a reason for demanding high wages? Is not\nthe lesson that Christ has given sufficient? He says, \u201cIf any man\nwill come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and\nfollow me\u201d (Matthew 16:24).\nOur institutions were established to serve as an effectual means\nof advancing the work of soulsaving. Those connected with them\nare to study how they can help the institution, not how they can\ntake the most out of the treasury. If they grasp more than is their\ndue, they hinder the cause of God. Let everyone connected with\nthese institutions say: \u201cI will not set my wages at a high figure,\nbecause that would rob the treasury, and the proclamation of the\nmessage of mercy would be hindered. I must practice economy.\nThose who are out in the field are doing a work that is as essential\n176 Selected Messages Book 2\nas the work that I am doing. I must do all in my power to help\nthem. It is God\u2019s means that I am handling, and I will do as Christ\nwould do in my place. I will not spend money for luxuries. I will\nremember the Lord\u2019s workers in mission fields. They have more\nneed of means than I have. In their work they come in contact with\nmuch poverty and distress. They must feed the hungry and clothe\nthe naked. I must limit my expenditures, that I may share in their\nlabor of love.\u201d\u2014Special Testimonies, Series B 19:19, 20.\nAn Appeal for Equality\nLet there be more equality among us. There is too much eager\ngrasping for recompense. Selfish estimates of the labor done are be-\ning made. Let no man receive so large a salary because he supposes\nhe has adaptability to do a certain work, thus placing the work done\nfor God and for the advancement of His cause on a mercenary basis.\nTo whom much is given, of him much will be required. Let those[184]\nwho argue that they should receive large salaries because of their\nabilities and peculiar gifts inquire of themselves, \u201cWhose are the\ntalents I am trading upon? Have I used these talents in such a way\nas to bring the greatest glory to God? Have I doubled the talents lent\nme?\u201d A consecrated use of these talents would bring a revenue to\nthe cause of God. All our talents belong to God, and both principal\nand interest are one day to be handed back to Him.\nIf those who have been connected with the work of God for many\nyears would study carefully how much injury they have done the\nLord\u2019s vineyard by unwise moves, by departing from right principles\nand diverting means from the cause of God by using their influence\nto lead others into crooked paths, instead of grasping for higher\nwages they would humble themselves before God with a repentance\nthat needeth not to be repented of. Let them ask themselves the\nquestion,\u201d \u2018How much owest thou unto my Lord?\u2019 (Luke 16:5).\nWhat account shall I render for the talent misused, for following my\nown unsanctified imagination? What can I do to blot out the evil\nresults of my unwise moves which have so limited the resources\nof the cause?\u201d Had every man occupied his position of trust with\nfaithfulness, there would be no dearth of means today in the Lord\u2019s\ntreasury.\nGeneral Principles Governing Worker Remuneration 177\nOur relation to the work of God is not to be placed on a mercenary\nfoundation\u2014according to the estimate of man, so much work, so\nmuch pay. It is a great mistake for men to suppose their services are\ninvaluable. Let God be true to his word, and there will be a great\nchange in the estimate of work done for the Master.\nOh, there are many things to be corrected in the men who are\nready to grasp so much. How inappropriate are the selfish graspings\nfor reward. This craving for high wages has expelled the love of\nGod from many hearts. Pride of position is a deep-seated evil which\nhas ruined thousands. Yes, tens of thousands, full of ambition for\ndistinction and display, have been ruined because they have lost sight [185]\nof principle. They have measured themselves among themselves,\nand compared themselves with themselves. Their eager grasping for\ncredit and reward has resulted in diminished spirituality. This is a\nlesson all should study carefully, that they may be warned against\nselfishness and avarice, against pride which destroys love for God\nand corrodes the soul.\nWhen any man connected with the work of God refuses to work\nfor the wages he is receiving, when he is receiving a reasonable sum\nfor his services, he may obtain what he asks for, but it will often be\nat the loss of the grace of God from his heart, which is of more value\nthan gold and silver and precious stones.\u2014Manuscript 164, 1899.\nThe Toll of Large Wages\nThe incarnation of Christ was an act of self-sacrifice; His life was\none of continual self-denial. The highest glory of the love of God to\nman was manifested in the sacrifice of His only-begotten Son, who\nwas the express image of His person. This is the great mystery of\ngodliness. It is the privilege and the duty of every professed follower\nof Christ to have the mind of Christ. Without self-denial and cross\nbearing we cannot be His disciples.\nWhen the resolutions were proposed and accepted to pay the\nlarge wages to those working in the Review and Herald office, the\nenemy was succeeding in his plan to turn aside the purposes of\nGod, and to lead souls into false paths. The selfish, grasping spirit\naccepted the large wages. Had the workers practiced the principles\nset forth in the lessons of Christ, they could not conscientiously have\n178 Selected Messages Book 2\nreceived such wages. And what was the effect of this increase of\nwages? The expenses of the family living were greatly increased.\nThere was a departure from the instructions and examples given in\nthe life of Christ. Pride was awakened and indulged; means were\ninvested for display, for needless self-gratification. Love of the world\ntook possession of the heart, and unsanctified ambition ruled the\nsoul temple. The large wages became a curse. The example was not[186]\nafter Christ, but after the world.\nLove to Christ will not lead to self-indulgence, it will not lead\nto any unnecessary expenditure of means to please and gratify self\nor to foster pride in the human heart. The love of Jesus in the heart\never leads the soul to humility and entire conformity to the will of\nGod.\u2014Letter 21, 1894.\nWhen sin strikes inwardly, it assails the most noble part of a\nman\u2019s being. It makes terrible confusion and havoc with man\u2019s\nGodlike faculties and powers. While physical disease prostrates the\nbody, the disease of selfishness and covetousness blasts the soul.\u2014\nLetter 26, 1897.\nHigher Wages Proposed for Superior Men\nMy heart is deeply stirred by the scenes which during the night\nhave passed before me. In the night season I heard from some of\nmy brethren propositions with which I cannot agree. The statements\nthey made indicate that they are on the wrong track, that they have\nnot an experience which will guard them from deception. I was\ngrieved to hear from the lips of some of our brethren expressions\nthat show neither faith in God nor loyalty to His truth. Propositions\nwere made that, if carried out, would lead away from the straight\nand narrow way.\nSome think that if higher wages were paid to men of superior\ntalent, these men would remain among us; then more work would\nbe accomplished, in a more thorough manner, and the cause of truth\nwould stand on a more elevated platform.\nConcerning this question I have received instruction from One\nwho never errs. Suppose this plan were followed, \u201cWho,\u201d I ask,\n\u201cis competent to measure the genuine usefulness and the influence\nGeneral Principles Governing Worker Remuneration 179\nof his fellow workmen?\u201d No man is qualified to judge of another\u2019s\nusefulness in the service of God.\nThe position or office a man may hold is not alone an indication\nof his usefulness in the cause of God. It is the development of a\nChristlike character through sanctification of the spirit that will give [187]\nhim influence for good. In the estimation of God the degree of his\nfaithfulness determines the value of his service.\nGod accepts the services of those only who are partakers of the\ndivine nature. Without Christ man can do nothing. Love for God\nand man alone places human beings on vantage ground with God.\nObedience to the divine command enables us to become laborers\ntogether with God. Love is the fruit that is borne on the Christian\ntree, the fruit that is as the leaves of the tree of life for the healing of\nthe nations.\u2014Manuscript 108, 1903.\nThe Necessities and Comforts of Life\nIn the Lord\u2019s treasury there should be sufficient means to give an\nadequate support to those who devote their time to the work of saving\nsouls. Their just wages should not be begrudged them. Those who\nare willing to labor for the Master should not be allowed to lack for\nthe necessities of life. They should be enabled to live comfortably,\nand also to have enough so that they can make donations to the cause\nof God; for it frequently happens that they are expected to take the\nlead in making offerings.\u2014Manuscript 103, 1906.\nFree From Worldly Enterprises and Conflicting Duties\nThere are many things that need to be adjusted, that will be\nadjusted if we adhere strictly to principle. Special instruction has\nbeen given me in regard to our ministers. It is not the will of God\nthat they shall seek to be rich. They should not engage in worldly\nenterprises, for this disqualifies them for giving their best powers\nto spiritual things. But they are to receive wages enough to support\nthemselves and their families. And they are not to have so many\nburdens laid upon them that they cannot give proper attention to the\nchurch in their own home. It is their duty to teach their children\nas did Abraham to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and [188]\n180 Selected Messages Book 2\njudgment....\nLet ministers and teachers remember that God holds them ac-\ncountable to fill their office to the best of their ability, to bring into\ntheir work their very best powers. They are not to take up duties\nthat conflict with the work God has given them. When ministers\nand teachers, pressed continually under the burden of financial re-\nsponsibility, enter the pulpit or the schoolroom weary and tired, with\nthrobbing brain and overtaxed nerves, what can be expected but that\ncommon fire will be used instead of the sacred fire of God\u2019s kin-\ndling? The strained, tattered efforts hurt the speaker and disappoint\nthe listeners. He has had no time to seek the Lord, no time to ask\nin faith for the unction of the Holy Spirit. Shall we not change this\nway of working?\u2014Manuscript 101, 1902.\nAvoid Cultivating Expensive Tastes\nThe workers must arouse themselves to see afar off. With many\nself-denial and self-sacrifice are dead, and these elements must be\nraised to life again. Men must understand that the large wages which\nthey demand are sapping the Lord\u2019s treasury. They are binding up\nGod\u2019s money in private interests, and by their actions are saying to\nthe world, \u201cMy Lord delayeth his coming\u201d (Matthew 24:48). Shall\nnot this thing be changed? Who will come up to the great example\nof the Master Worker?\u2014Letter 120, 1899.\nDo not talk about your meager wages. Do not cultivate a taste\nfor expensive articles of dress or furniture. Let the work advance\nas it began, in simple self-denial and faith. Let a different order of\nthings come in.\u2014Letter 94, 1899.\nSpirit of Self-Denial of Early Days Required Now\nThere is just as much self-denial required now as when we first\nstarted in the work, when we were only a little handful of people,\nwhen we knew what self-denial meant, what self-sacrifice meant,[189]\nwhen we tried to get out the little papers, little leaflets, that should\ngo to those who were in darkness. There are a few connected with\nthe office today who were with us then. For years we received no\nwages, except barely enough to furnish us with the plainest food and\nGeneral Principles Governing Worker Remuneration 181\nclothing. We were glad to wear secondhand clothes, and sometimes\nwe had hardly food enough to sustain our strength. Everything else\nwas put into the work. After a time my husband received six dollars\na week, and we lived on that, and I worked with him in the cause.\nOthers labored in a similar way....\nThose that have come in to take up the work, after it has been\nmade a success, should walk very modestly. They should manifest\nthe spirit of self-sacrifice. God means that the institutions here shall\nbe carried on by self-sacrifice, just as the foundation was laid.\u2014The\nGeneral Conference Daily Bulletin, March 20, 1891, p. 184.\nWhen this work is done as it should be, when we labor with\ndivine zeal to add converts to the truth, the world will see that\na power attends the message of truth. The unity of the believers\nbears testimony to the power of the truth that can bring into perfect\nharmony men of different dispositions, making their interests one.\nThe prayers and offerings of the believers are combined with\nearnest, self-sacrificing efforts, and they are indeed a spectacle to\nthe world, to angels, and to men. Men are converted anew. The hand\nthat once grasped for recompense in higher wages has become the\nhelping hand of God. The believers are united by one interest\u2014the\ndesire to make centers of truth where God shall be exalted. Christ\njoins them together in holy bonds of union and love, bonds which\nhave irresistible power.\nIt was for this unity that Jesus prayed just before His trial, stand-\ning but a step from the cross. \u201cThat they all may be one,\u201d He said,\n\u201cas thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one\nin us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me\u201d (John\n17:21).\u2014Letter 32, 1903.\nChapter 21\u2014The Workers in Our Institutions[190]\nProcuring the Very Best Talent\nFrom time to time, I have felt urged by the Spirit of the Lord\nto bear a testimony to our brethren in regard to the necessity of\nprocuring the very best talent to work in our various institutions\nand in the numerous other departments of our cause. Those who\nare thus connected with the work must be trained men, men whom\nGod can teach and whom He can honor as He did Daniel, with\nwisdom and understanding. They must be thinking men, men who\nbear God\u2019s impress, and who are steadily progressing in holiness, in\nmoral dignity, and in the excellence with which they labor. If they\nare growing men, if they possess reasoning minds and sanctified\nintelligence, if they listen to the voice of God, and seek to catch\nevery ray of light from heaven, and they will, like the sun, pursue an\nundeviating course, and they will grow in wisdom and in favor with\nGod....\nThose who are placed in leading positions in connection with\nour institutions should be men who have sufficient breadth of mind\nto respect those of cultivated intellect, and who will recompense\nthem proportionately to the responsibilities they bear. True, those\nwho engage in the work of the Lord should not do so merely for the\nwages they receive, but to honor God, advance His cause, and to\nobtain imperishable riches. At the same time we should not expect[191]\nthat those who are capable of taking hold of a work that requires\nthought and painstaking effort, and of doing it with exactitude and\nthoroughness should receive no greater compensation than the less\nskillful workman. A true estimate must be placed upon talent. Those\nwho cannot appreciate true work and mental ability should not oc-\ncupy the position of managers in our institutions, for their influence\nwill tend to bind about the work, to erect barriers to its progress, and\nto bring it down to a low level.\n182\nWorkers in Our Institutions 183\nIf our institutions are as prosperous as God designs they shall be,\nthere must be more thoughtfulness and earnest prayer, mingled with\nunflagging zeal and skillful labor. To connect this class of laborers\nwith the work may require a greater outlay of means. But while it is\nessential that economy be exercised in everything possible, it will\nbe found that the efforts of some narrow minds to save means by\nemploying those who will work cheap, and whose labor corresponds\nin character with the cheapness of their wages, will result in the end\nin their loss. The progress of the work will be retarded, and the\ncause belittled.\u2014Letter 63, 1886.\nWages for Institutional Workers\nThe publishing work has been founded in sacrifice; it has been\nmaintained by the special providence of God. We started it in great\npoverty. We had scarcely enough to eat and wear. When potatoes\nwere scarce, and we had to pay a high price for them, we supplied\ntheir place with turnips. Six dollars per week was all we received for\nthe first years of our labor. We had a large family; but we brought\nour expenses within our means. We could not purchase all that we\ndesired; we had to bind about our wants. But we were determined\nthat the world should have the light of present truth; and spirit, soul,\nand body were interwoven with the work. We worked early and late,\nwithout rest, without the stimulus of wages and God was with us. As\nprosperity attended the publishing work, the wages were increased,\nas they should be.\nA Wage Scale, but with Equity [192]\nWhile I was in Switzerland, word came to me from Battle Creek\nthat a plan had been formed by which none working in the office\nshould receive more than twelve dollars per week. I said, This will\nnot work; it will be a necessity for some to receive higher wages\nthan this. But double this amount should not be awarded to any\nman connected with the office; for if a few take from the treasury\nso largely, justice cannot be shown to all. Large wages afforded to\na few is the world\u2019s plan; while others in every way as deserving\nreceive far less. This is not justice.\n184 Selected Messages Book 2\nThe Lord will have faithful men who love and fear Him con-\nnected with every school, every printing office, health institution,\nand publishing house. Their wages should not be fashioned after the\nworldling\u2019s standard. There should be, as far as possible, excellent\njudgment exercised to keep up, not an aristocracy, but an equality,\nwhich is the law of heaven. \u201cAll ye are brethren\u201d (Matthew 23:8).\nA few should not demand large wages, and such wages should not\nbe presented as an inducement to secure ability and talents. This\nis placing things on a worldly principle. The increase of wages\nbrings with it a corresponding increase of selfishness, pride, display,\nself-gratification, and needless extravagance that the people who do\ntheir utmost to pay their tithes and present their offerings to God do\nnot have. Poverty is seen in all their borders. The Lord loves the one\njust as much as the other, with the exception that the self-sacrificing,\nhumble, contrite souls who love God and strive to serve Him, are\never kept nearer to the great heart of infinite Love than the man who\nfeels at liberty to have all the good things of this life.\nNot to Copy the World\u2019s Standard\nI have had many testimonies in regard to the point that we are not\nto copy the world\u2019s standard. We are not to indulge our inclination\nto grasp all we can possibly obtain, to spend our means in dress\nand luxuries of life as do the worldlings. It makes us not one jot\nhappier to live to please ourselves. The unnecessary outlay of means[193]\nis robbing the treasury of God; and someone has to supply the\ndeficiency. The facilities for building up the kingdom of Christ in\nthis world are greatly limited because men rob God in tithes and\nofferings.\nLet not the idea prevail for a moment that a man\u2019s power to\ncommand high wages is a measure of his value in the sight of God\nas a worker. In the eyes of the world a man\u2019s value is estimated by,\n\u201cHow much is he worth in property?\u201d But heaven\u2019s books register\nhis worth in proportion to the good he has accomplished with the\nmeans he has had entrusted to him. In the fear and love of God, with\nhis talents wholly sanctified to advance the glory of God, man can\nand will show his true value. Only when the reward is given to every\nWorkers in Our Institutions 185\nman as his work shall be estimated in the judgment, can it be known\nhow much he has sent before him to heaven.\nFor years my testimony has been borne against the meager sum\npaid to some of our ministers. Inquire, search into the books, and\nyou will find that there has been very close dealing with some of our\nministers. The auditing committee need to understand their business\nand have the mind of Christ. There are some men of narrow minds\non this committee, men who have not a true idea of the self-denial\nand self-sacrifice required of the minister of God. They have no true\nestimate of what it means to leave home, wife, and children, and\nbecome missionaries for God, to labor for souls as they that must\ngive an account. A true minister of God will turn his whole life into\na sacrifice.\nThe Warning at Salamanca\nWhile at Salamanca, New York, in November, 1890, there were\npresented to me many things. I was shown that there was coming\ninto the office a spirit that God did not approve. While some accept\nlarge wages, there are others who have labored at their post faithfully\nfor years, who receive very much less. I have been repeatedly shown\nthat God\u2019s order is not to be broken down and the missionary spirit\nextinguished....\nI know there are those who practice much self-denial to pay [194]\ntheir tithes and make offerings to the cause of God. Those who\nstand at the head of the work should take such a course that they\ncan unblushingly say, \u201cCome, let us act mutually in this work which\nwas commenced in sacrifice, and is supported by continual self-\ndenial.\u201d The people should not excel those who stand at the head\nof our institutions in practicing economy, and binding about their\nwants.\u2014Manuscript 25a, 1891.\nA View of Threatening Dangers in 1890\nI am alarmed at the outlook both for the sanitarium and the\npublishing house at Battle Creek and our institutions generally. A\nspirit has been manifesting itself, and strengthening year by year in\nthe institutions, that is of an entirely different character from that\nwhich the Lord has revealed in His Word should characterize the\n186 Selected Messages Book 2\nphysicians and workers connected with our health institutions, and\nthe work of publishing. The idea is entertained that the physicians\nat the sanitarium and men in responsible positions in the publishing\nhouse are not under obligations to be controlled by self-denying,\nself-sacrificing principles of Christianity. But this idea has its origin\nin the councils of Satan. When physicians make manifest the fact\nthat they think more of the wages they are to receive than of the work\nof the institution, they show that they are not men to be depended\nupon as unselfish, God-fearing servants of Christ, faithful in doing\nthe work of the Master. Men who are controlled by selfish desires\nshould not remain connected with our institutions....\nGod will require a return from men in proportion as they set a\nvalue upon themselves and their services, for they will be judged\naccording to their deeds, and by no less a standard than they them-\nselves have established. If they have accounted their talents of so\ngreat value, and placed a high estimate upon their abilities, they will\nbe required to render service proportionate to their own estimate and\ndemands. Oh, how few have any real acquaintance with the Father[195]\nor with His Son Jesus Christ. If they were imbued with the spirit of\nChrist they would work the works of Christ. \u201cLet this mind be in\nyou, which was also in Christ Jesus\u201d (Philippians 2:5).\nTalents Belong to God\nHe who judgeth righteously has said, \u201cWithout Me ye can do\nnothing\u201d (John 15:5). All talents, great or small, have been entrusted\nto men by God, to be employed in His service, and when men use\ntheir ability simply for themselves, and have no special care to work\nin harmony with those in medical practice, who are of the same faith,\nthey reveal that they are inclined to judge these men by themselves;\nthey do not seek to answer the prayer of Christ, that they may be one\nas He is one with the Father. When they demand exorbitant prices\nfor their services, God, the Judge of all the earth, will hold them to\nthe measure of their own overrated estimation, and require of them\nto the full extent of the value they put upon themselves.\nAs they judge of their worth from a money point of view, God\nwill judge of their works, comparing their services with their valua-\ntion of them. Unless converted, no one who thus overrates his ability,\nWorkers in Our Institutions 187\nwill ever enter heaven, for his personal influence in the service of\nChrist will never balance the scale of his estimation of himself or of\nhis demands for his service for others....\nHe who is selfish and grasping, eager to take every dollar he can\nget from our institutions for his services, is binding about the work\nof God; verily he has his reward. He cannot be accounted worthy to\nbe entrusted with the eternal, heavenly reward in the mansions Christ\nhas gone to prepare for those who deny self and take up the cross and\nfollow Him. The fitness of men to enter the blood-bought inheritance\nis tested during this probationary life. Those who have the spirit of\nself-sacrifice manifested in Christ, when He gave Himself for the\nsalvation of fallen man, are those who will drink of the cup and be\nbaptized with the baptism, and they will share in the glory of the\nRedeemer.\u2014Letter 41, 1890.\nThe Importance of Self-Denial [196]\nI was shown that the office of publication should not be con-\nducted on the same principles as are other publishing houses; for\nit is to be something after the order of a training school. Everyone\nconnected with it is to be a true missionary, and work upon the\nsame principles that brought it into existence. Self-denial should\ncharacterize all the workers....\nSelf-denial should characterize the men employed in responsible\npositions in the office, and they should be an example to all the\nworkers. The office was brought into existence through self-denial,\nand the same spirit should be manifested and maintained. The great\nobject must be kept in view. This is missionary work, and those who\nhave no missionary spirit should not continue in the work.\u2014Letter\n5, 1892.\nA Threat to All Our Institutions\nPaul could see evils coming into the church, and he declared, \u201cI\nam jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to\none husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. But\nI fear, lest, by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his\n188 Selected Messages Book 2\nsubtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that\nis in Christ\u201d (2 Corinthians 11:2, 3).\nThis is the evil which today threatens our schools, our institu-\ntions, our churches. Unless corrected, it will imperil the souls of\nmany. One man will think that he should be greatly favored, because\nhe is doing a line of work which among unbelievers would com-\nmand large wages. Becoming dissatisfied, he will sell himself to the\nhighest bidder. For the safety of the principles that should control all\nwho labor in our institutions, the Lord bids me say to all who carry\nresponsibilities, \u201cDisconnect from all such without any delay; for\nthis is the evil leaven of selfishness and covetousness.\u201d\nThey are measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing\nthemselves among themselves. The worst thing you can do for them\nis to seek to retain them, even though they be editors or managers.[197]\nGod is not with such a man, and you cannot with any safety hold\nonto him. An atmosphere of unbelief surrounds his soul. The\ncomparisons he has made have led him to double-dealing. He says\nto himself, \u201cIf such a one received such a sum, I should receive\njust as much.\u201d He becomes wise above what is written in the law,\nand appropriates means for his own use. Thus he robs the treasury.\nGod looks upon this as He looked upon the sin of Achan. He sees\nthat such men cannot give the right mold to the work. They cannot\nsupply the necessities of those who are laboring in hard fields, who\nhave to give part of their wages to the needs of these fields. God\nsees every such case, and He will pass judgment on those who thus\nmeasure themselves, selfishly taking care that they receive all they\nthink they should have.\u2014Manuscript 97, 1899.\nA Characteristic Feature of the Work Imperiled\nIn view of the large work that is to be done, our laborers should\nbe willing to work for a reasonable wage. Even if you could obtain\nlarge wages, you should consider the example of Christ in coming\nto our world and living a life of self-denial. Just at this time it\nmeans very much what wages are demanded by the workers. If\nyou require and receive a large wage, the door is thrown open for\nothers to do the same. It was the demand for large wages among the\nworkers at Battle Creek that helped to spoil the spirit of the work\nWorkers in Our Institutions 189\nthere. Two men led out in this movement, and they were joined by\nthree or four others, and the result was a union in a course of action\nwhich, if followed by the majority, would have destroyed one of\nthe characteristic features of the work of this message. The cause\nof present truth was founded in self-denial and self-sacrifice. This\nselfish, grasping spirit is entirely opposed to its principles. It is like\nthe deadly leprosy, which in time will disease the whole body. I\nam afraid of it. We need to take heed lest we outgrow the simple,\nself-sacrificing spirit that marked our work in its early years.\nYou will not find it difficult to exert a wide influence in the [198]\nsanitarium at_____. If you will act an unselfish part, not requiring\nthe wages which you would naturally suppose you must draw, the\nLord will sustain you in your work. If, on the other hand, you ask\nfor a high wage, another, and still another, will think that they have\na right to demand just as high wage as you; and by this means the\nmoney will be used that should be expended in building up the work\nof the cause of present truth in other places.\nIn making important decisions we should study every side of\nthe question. We are ever to remember that we are given a place\nin the work to act as responsible agencies. Some would follow a\nworldly fashion in the drawing of their salaries; but the Lord does\nnot view matters as these men view them. He views our duties and\nresponsibilities in the light of Christ\u2019s self-denying example. The\ngospel must be so presented to the world that precept and example\nwill harmonize.\nOur sanitariums are not to be conducted after the customs of the\nworld. It is not to be considered necessary that even the medical\nsuperintendent shall draw a large salary. We are the servants of\nGod.\u2014Letter 370, 1907.\nPhysicians and Ministers Called to Self-Denial\nI feel impressed to write to you this morning, and ask that you\nbe sure to treat all men with equity. I have been instructed that there\nis danger of your taking a course with some physicians that will\nbe an injury to them. We are to do all in our power to encourage\nministerial talent, and also that of physicians, by giving them every\n190 Selected Messages Book 2\nconsistent advantage, but there is a limit beyond which we should\nnot go.\nWhen we were trying to find a physician to act as medical super-\nintendent of the Loma Linda Sanitarium, one experienced physician\nconsented to come upon certain conditions. He stated a certain\namount for his services, and said that he would not come for less.\nSome thought that, because it seemed so difficult to find anyone, we[199]\nmight invite this physician on his terms. But I said to Brother [J. A.]\nBurden, \u201cIt would not be right to employ this doctor, and pay him so\nmuch, when others who are working just as faithfully receive less.\nThis is not justice, and the Lord has instructed me that He would not\napprove of such discrimination.\u201d\nThe Lord calls for self-denial in His service, and this obligation\nis binding upon physicians as well as upon ministers. We have\nbefore us an aggressive work which requires means, and we must\ncall into service young men to labor as ministers and as physicians,\nnot for the highest wages, but because of the great needs of God\u2019s\ncause. The Lord is not pleased with this spirit of grasping for the\nhighest wages. We need physicians and ministers whose hearts are\nconsecrated to God, and who receive their marching orders from the\ngreatest Medical Missionary that has ever trod this earth. Let them\nbehold His life of self-denial, and then gladly sacrifice, in order that\nmore workers may engage in sowing the gospel seed. If all will\nwork in this spirit, less wages will be required.\nSome have failed on this point. God has blessed them with\nability to do acceptable service, but they have failed to learn lessons\nof economy, of self-denial, and of walking humbly with God. Their\ndemands for high wages were granted, and they became extravagant\nin the use of means; they lost the influence for good they should have\nhad, and the prospering hand of God was not with them. Beware\nof placing too great confidence in those who demand high wages\nbefore they will engage in the Lord\u2019s work. I write you this as a\ncaution.\u2014Letter 330, 1906.\nCounsel to a Physician Regarding a Fixed Salary\nThe plan that you are to receive above your wages any money\nthat you may make in certain lines of work, is opening a door of\nWorkers in Our Institutions 191\ntemptation which will lead to evil results. This is not discerned by\nyou or by those who drew up these articles of agreement. But it will [200]\nbe the means of great injury to you, and will bring reproach upon\nthe cause of God. There is in this plan an erroneous principle, which\nmust be considered. Nothing is to be left at loose ends. Everything\nis to be bound off. You are to receive a definite sum as wages for\nyour work, and live within that sum.\nSomething of this character has been carried on in the negotia-\ntions with Dr. U. It is a fraudulent transaction. God sees its tendency\nand its result. This method of remuneration is not to be carried out\nin the sanitariums that are to be established. This institution must\npay you a suitable sum for your services. And all who are connected\nwith the institution must receive remuneration in proportion to their\nservices.\u2014Letter 99, 1900.\nA Percentage Proposition Counseled Against\nIn regard to the proposition made by Brother V ., [A $25-a-week\nsalary, 30 per cent on the operations, with a five-year contract, and\none month a year off for study and improvement at his own ex-\npense.\u2014Compilers.] I look at the matter as you do. We cannot\nafford to start out on the high-wage plan. This was the misfortune\nof the people in Battle Creek, and I have something to say on this\npoint. We have before us a large field of missionary work. We are\nto be sure to heed the requirements of Christ, who made Himself\na donation to our world. Nothing that we can possibly do should\nbe left undone. There is to be neatness and order, and everything\npossible is to be done to show thoroughness in every line. But when\nit comes to paying twenty-five dollars a week, and giving a large\npercentage on the surgical work done, light was given me in Aus-\ntralia that this could never be, because our record is at stake. The\nmatter was presented to me that many sanitariums would have to\nbe established in Southern California; for there would be a great\ninflowing of the people there. Many would seek that climate.\nWe must stand in the counsel of God, every one of us prepared [201]\nto follow the example of Jesus Christ. We cannot consent to pay\nextravagant wages. God requires of His under-physicians a compli-\nance with the invitation, \u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me;\n192 Selected Messages Book 2\nfor I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your\nsouls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (Matthew 11:29,\n30).\u2014Letter 309, 1905.\n\u201cDo Not Exact a High Salary\u201d\nI would be very pleased to see and converse with you. I have an\nintense desire that you shall copy the pattern given in the Word of\nGod. . . .\nDr. W, I entreat of you that you do not exact a high salary. If you\ndo this, others will follow your example; and if this is allowed, we\nshall soon find that the sanitarium income will all be absorbed for\nthe payment of salaries, and that there will be none to carry on the\nmissionary work to be done in foreign countries.\nI write you this because I understand that whereof I am speaking.\nThe Lord is testing His people. My husband and I have passed\nover this ground, and because we did not ask a high wage, but were\nwilling to work in self-denial and self-sacrifice, the Lord blessed us\nwith His rich grace. If you will pursue a course of self-denial, you\nwill be an example to others that will be a blessing to the work. In\nyour work in _____, the most effective sermon you preached was\nwhen you lived the principles of the truth in your own family and\nrevealed your earnest devotion to the work. I know what I am talking\nabout when I say this.\nThere should be more equality between the wage of the minister\nand the physician than there has been. Our ministers are expected to\nset an example of liberality to the church members, and their salary\nshould be such that they can make many donations.\u2014Letter 372,\n1907.\nExtravagance and Influence\nAmong our ministers, physicians, teachers, and canvassers, there\nis need of an entire surrender of the mind, the heart, and the soul to[202]\nGod. . . . Neither dress, expensive homes, nor stylish living gives\ncharacter to the work. But a meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of\nGod of great value. Religion does not make a man course and rough.\nThe true believer, realizing his own weakness, will guard himself at\nWorkers in Our Institutions 193\nevery point, and place his whole confidence in God. True Christian\ngodliness cannot be forced; it is the outflowing of an honest heart....\nGod calls for minute men, praying men, practical men. Expen-\nsive outward show does not elevate men and women in the eyes\nof sensible people. It is not right for a physician to make an ex-\ntravagant outlay of means, and then charge exorbitant prices for\nperforming small operations. God looks at all these matters in their\ntrue light.\u2014Manuscript 34, 1904.\nAn Important Interview Regarding Physicians\u2019 Wages\n[On the morning of December 4, 1913, the leading brethren of the\nPacific Union Conference conferred with Mrs. E. G. White at her\nElmshaven home in regard to the remuneration of our sanitarium\nphysicians. A stenographic report of the interview was made and\nthe ribbon copy bears a handwritten note of endorsement by Mrs.\nWhite in these words: \u201cThis is correctly presented, and I repeat this\nfor the benefit of others. May the Lord help us and teach and guide\nus at every step in our difficulties.\u201d Essential portions of the report\nof this interview follow.\u2014Compilers.]\nPresent: Ellen G. White, Elders F. M. Burg, G. W. Reaser, W.\nM. Adams, J. H. Behrens, C. L. Taggart, A. G. Christiansen, W. C.\nWhite; also C.C. Crisler.\nAfter introductions and greetings, Elder W. C. White said in\npart:\nAll day yesterday we were considering the interests of our var-\nious schools in the Pacific Union Conference. In these schools\nlocated at Angwin, Lodi, Fernando, Armona, and Loma Linda, there\nare between six and seven hundred students in training. We were\nencouraged as we took counsel together regarding these schools.\nToday we must enter into consideration of sanitarium problems,\nparticularly the question of the wages we should pay to physicians\nand surgeons. We have in our _____ Sanitarium a God-fearing [203]\nphysician who has won the confidence of all his associates\u2014a man\nwhom God has blessed greatly in his ministry to the sick. He wants\nto remain, and everybody wants him to remain; and he feels that it\nwould be right for him to remain if his brethren could grant him a\n194 Selected Messages Book 2\nwage about twice as large as that paid to our average workers. He\nloves to give freely, and he wishes to have funds with which to live\nand to use for this purpose. We are much perplexed, and we would\nbe glad to know if you have any light on this matter.\nSister White: If he is granted considerably more than other physi-\ncians, they will come to believe they are not treated right unless they\nhave more also. We must move cautiously and understandingly, and\nnot allow wages to creep so high that many will be tempted. There\nmay have to be a coming down rather than going up, in physicians\u2019\nwages, because there is a great work to be done. Unless you have\nsome clear light from the Lord, it is not advisable to pay one man\nconsiderably more than another doing a similar work. For, if you\ndo, the others will think it perfectly proper to expect similar high\nwages. We must look at all things on all sides, and it is of no use for\nus to think that we can offer a successful worker a high wage simply\nbecause he may demand it. We must, rather, consider what we can\nafford to do at the present time, when the fields are opening upon\nwhich we shall henceforth have to expand much more means than\nwe have spent hitherto. These are matters that will test the faith of\nour people.\nW. C. White: They do test our faith, mother\u2014especially when a\ngroup of workers have labored with a man until they have learned\nto love him and admire him, and they believe that he can do better\nwork than any other man. Then it is natural for them to think that it\nis wrong for the brethren to withhold from him that which he might\nuse to advantage. They think, \u201cWhat is a thousand dollars, or fifteen\nhundred dollars, extra, when life is involved?\u201d They say, \u201cHere is\nsuch and such a case that he has just brought through, and there is\nanother whose life he has saved\u201d; and they feel as if it would be\nawfully mean of us not to meet his requirements. They say, \u201cThere[204]\nis no one who has to work and suffer as does a surgeon. Think of\nthe hours of arduous labor, of anxiety, of mental anguish he has to\nendure, when a precious life is hanging by a slender thread.\u201d\nBut, on the other hand, in considering this matter, we must\nremember that other institutions are influenced by our action. We\nsee a poor struggling sanitarium situated in a beautiful place, in a\nposition to do a large business, and with every prospect of making\nmoney if only they can have a brilliant physician; and they can get\nWorkers in Our Institutions 195\na good physician if they are encouraged to pay only three or five\nhundred dollars more than the wage scale recommended. They say,\n\u201cIf you will only let us pay a few hundred dollars more than you\nhave advised, we can gain five thousand dollars to cover this small\nadditional expense for wages.\u201d And thus it seems\u2014when we look at\nit from a business point of view.\nSister White: You see there is a selfishness that underlies that,\nthat the Lord is not pleased with. We must work harmoniously. It is\nthrough harmonious action that our work is to be carried forward,\nand some will have a very hard time. Some will have an easier time.\nBut all these things will have to be taken just as they come, and the\nworkers must remember what Jesus gave in coming to our world. I\nthink of it over and over and over again, and it seems to me that we\ncan do an excellent work if we set a right example. But if we desire\nthat which the most of our brethren cannot receive, this injures our\ninfluence. One brother says, \u201cSuch and such a brother has a certain\nwage, and I must have a wage to correspond.\u201d And so the wages will\nclimb, and keep climbing, higher and still higher. The fact is, that\nthe wages of some may have to be lower and still lower in order that\nwe may meet the extensive requirements of the work that is before\nus in warning the world....\nIn years past, when this subject of wages has been under consid-\neration, I have told my brethren that the Lord knows all about the\nspirit that prompts us to action, and that He can turn matters in our\nfavor at times when we do not expect it. As we set a right example, [205]\nthe blessing of the Lord will rest upon us. I have seen the Lord work\nin many ways and in many places to help the very ones that view\nthese matters in the right light and set a self-sacrificing example.\nAnd, brethren, as you labor earnestly, prayerfully, humbly, in the\nspirit of Christ, God will open doors before you. The people will\nsee your self-denial.\nAt times when my brethren have come to me, seeking advice\nas to whether they should demand a higher wage, I have told them\nthey might gain a little means by asking for higher wages, but that\nthe blessing of God will accompany those who follow a different\ncourse. God sees the self-denial; the Lord God of Israel sees every\nmotive; and when you come into a hard place, the angels of God are\nthere to help you, and to give you victory after victory.\n196 Selected Messages Book 2\nI have been very clear in counseling my brethren not to demand\nlarge wages, for this is not the impelling motive that leads us to\nspend our energies in the work of soulsaving.\nWe are not to let the wage question stand in the way of our\nresponding to the call of duty, wherever our service may be required.\nThe Lord can bring matters around so that a blessing will attach\nto our labors far exceeding any compensation we may or may not\nreceive; and He will give to His servants words to speak that are of\nthe highest consequence to perishing souls.\nThe people are hungering and thirsting for help from Heaven.\nI have tried to put in practice these principles of self-sacrifice, and\nI know whereof I speak when I say that the blessing of God will\nrest upon you when you make the call of duty first. I am glad for\nthis privilege of testifying before you this morning that the Lord has\nturned matters, over and over again, in such a way as to give us more\nthan we could possibly ask for.\nThe Lord will prove His servants; and if they prove true to Him,\nand leave their cases with Him, He will help them in every time of\nneed.\nWe are not laborers together for God for the wages we may\nreceive in His service. True, brethren, you must have wages with[206]\nwhich to support your families; but if you should begin to stipulate\nas to just how much you shall receive, you may prove a stumbling\nblock to someone else who does not have the disposition, perhaps,\nthat you have to be liberal; and the result will be confusion. Others\nwill think that all are not dealt with on an equality. You will soon\nfind that the cause of God will become cramped; and this result you\ndo not desire to see. You wish to see the cause of God placed on\nvantage ground. By your example, as well as by your words, the\npeople are to have a living assurance that the truth received into the\nheart begets the spirit of self-denial. And as you go forward in this\nspirit, there are many that will follow.\nThe Lord desires His children to act in that self-denying, self-sac-\nrificing way that will bring to us the satisfaction of having performed\nour duty well because it was duty. The only-begotten Son of God\ngave Himself to an ignominious death on the cross, and should we\ncomplain at the sacrifices we are called upon to make?\nWorkers in Our Institutions 197\nDuring my wakeful hours through the night season, I have been\npleading with the Lord to guard our brethren against the tendency to\npromise to go here or there on the stipulation that they are to have\na little higher wage. If they go in a spirit of self-sacrifice, trusting\nin Him, the Lord will grant sustaining power to mind and character,\nand success will be the result.\nIn the future, our work is to be carried forward in self-denial and\nself-sacrifice even beyond that which we have seen in past years.\nGod desires us to commit our souls to Him, that He may work\nthrough us in manifold ways. I feel intensely over these matters.\nBrethren, let us walk in meekness and lowliness of mind, and put\nbefore our associates an example of self-sacrifice. If we do our part\nin faith, God will open ways before us now undreamed of....\nIf someone proposes something that is not in accordance with\nself-sacrificing principles on which our work is based, let us re-\nmember that one stroke of God\u2019s hand can sweep away all seeming\nbenefit because it was not to His name\u2019s glory.\u2014Manuscript 12,\n1913.\nMeeting an Emergency [207]\nIf, when cramped for means, you let your competent workers go,\nto set up business for themselves, you will in a short time wish you\nhad them back. The question of finance can be managed nicely, if\nall the workers will be willing when there is a pressure for means,\nto accept less wages. This was the principle the Lord revealed to me\nto be brought into our publishing institutions. There will be plenty\nto do, and your work will need these very men. Should we not all be\nwilling to restrict our wants at a time when money is so scarce?\nMy husband and I worked on this principle. We said, \u201cThe\npublishing house is the Lord\u2019s institution, and we will economize,\nreducing our expenses as far as possible.\u201d The Lord requires self-\nsacrifice of all His servants to advance His work and make it a\nsuccess. Let every worker now do his best to sustain and guard our\npublishing institution in -----. Do you not think that the Lord will\nbe pleased to see this spirit control in all our institutions? We are to\nbring principle into the work. Jesus said, \u201cIf any man will come after\n198 Selected Messages Book 2\nme, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow\nme\u201d (Luke 9:23).

Let a fund be established to carry this\nwork forward. Then let those who have received help go forth to\nminister to the sick and suffering. This work will surely open the way\nfor the balm of Gilead to be applied to sin-sick souls.\u2014Manuscript\n35, 1901.\nAssistance Given Our First Medical Students\nMy husband and myself united in taking three promising young\nmen from their humble labors, and placing in the hands of each one\nthousand dollars to obtain an education in medical lines. This had\nbeen the selection that the Lord put into the mind of my husband.\nThe Lord had given light and preference to these three youth, and\nthey were to give themselves to the work of physicians.\u2014Letter 322,\n1905.\nQualifying Executives and Evangelists [209]\nThere must be a reaching higher, not seeking to excel in the\noutlay of large buildings and in display, but in the powers, the ca-\npabilities, the capacity that they may know how to manage these\nlarge interests.

It would be better to have it thus.\nThen when it is returned, it can be used to educate others. But this\nmoney is not to be taken from the tithe, but from a separate fund\nsecured for that purpose. This would exert a healthy uprightness and\ncharity and patriotism among our people.

But let there be no meager, stingy plans,\nin using the consecrated portion for the sustaining of the ministry;\nfor then the treasury would soon be empty.\u2014Letter 40, 1897.\nChapter 23\u2014Counsel to One Who for Financial [210]\nReasons Was Planning to Leave the Work of God\n[On November 3, 1892, a publishing house manager wrote to\nMrs. E. G. White to inform her that he had decided to leave the\ninstitution for employment outside the denominational work because\nof personal financial embarrassment. He had not managed to live\nwithin his income, had become indebted to the institution to the total\namount of $1,244 during a period of eight years. In the meantime\nhe had accumulated in like manner a debt at the sanitarium. Both\ninstitutions were kindly requesting him to settle these accounts. He\nfelt that under the circumstances he would be justified in leaving\ndenominational work for outside employment paying higher wages,\nwith the hope of paying his debts and with the prospect of never\nreturning to labor in the cause of God. The following letter is Mrs.\nWhite\u2019s reply.\u2014Compilers.]\nMy brother, in your letter you speak of leaving the Review office.\nI am sorry that you can be willing to separate from the work for\nthe reasons you mention. They reveal that you have a much deeper\nexperience to gain than you now have. Your faith is very weak.\nOther families, much larger than yours, sustain themselves without\none word of complaint, on half the wages you have. We have been\nover the ground, and I know what I am talking about. It is evident\nthat whether you remain in the Review office or separate from it you\nhave lessons to learn that will be of the highest interest to you. I do\nnot feel at liberty to urge you to remain; for unless you drink deeper\nof the Fountain of living waters, your service will not be acceptable\nto God.\nI do not know who would occupy the position that would be left [211]\nvacant if you should leave, but if the work that the Lord designs and\nlongs to do is done for the church in Battle Creek, I am sure He\nwill help them in any crisis. He wants no forced service. Unless\nHis words find entrance to the soul, and bring the entire man into\nsubjection to Christ, the human agent will, when tempted and tried,\n201\n202 Selected Messages Book 2\nchoose to follow his own inclination rather than the ways of the\nLord. I had hoped that the truth which has been shining in clear,\ndistinct beams of light since the Minneapolis meeting, would flood\nyour soul. But from the letters you have written, I know that you are\nnot walking in the light....\nWhatever position a man may fill in connection with the office\nof publication, he is not to be paid an exorbitant sum, for God does\nnot work in this way. You lacked spiritual eyesight, and you needed\nthe heavenly anointing, that you might see that the work of God\nwas founded in a sacrifice, and only by a sacrifice can it be carried\nforward....\nThere have been those connected with the publishing house\nwho know not and do not wish to know by experience what it cost\ntheir predecessors to build up the work. When these later workers\naccepted a part in it, they did not enter into a partnership with God.\nThey do not recognize the principles and conditions that must govern\nthe human agent in cooperation with the divine. \u201cGod so loved the\nworld, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth\nin him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d No man who\nis not a partaker of this self-sacrificing love is prepared to labor\nfor God. Many are blundering along, clinging to their burden of\nselfishness, as if it were a precious treasure, keeping diligently their\nown way. When they knock at the gate of heaven, saying, \u201cLord,\nLord, open unto us,\u201d many a man will hear the words, \u201cNo one enters\nhere but those who can receive the heavenly benediction, \u2018Well done,\nthou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few\nthings, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the\njoy of thy lord.\u2019 But thou hast faithfully served thyself, worked for[212]\nthine own selfish interest, been good to thyself. Thou hast not laid\nup a treasure in heaven.\u201d\nWe are not safe for one moment in cherishing indifference and\ncarelessness in regard to our soul\u2019s salvation. Many will have to\narouse and change their course of action if they are saved. The\nperils of the last days are upon us. Connection with divine influence\nthrough a strong, living, working faith, can alone make us to be\nlaborers together with God.

There must be prayerful study and determined effort\non the part of all who shall win the crown of life.\nLet none feel that they can claim any merits because of their ad-\nvantages of birth or position or education. How did they obtain those\nadvantages? Only through Christ. God calls upon all who would\nhave everlasting life to copy the Pattern. Truth and righteousness are\nthe first principles of the gospel, and the only principles that Christ\nwill recognize in any human agent. There must be heartfelt surrender\nof our will to God; we must renounce all our own supposed merits,\nand look to the cross of Calvary. This surrender to God involves\neffort on the part of the human agent to cooperate with the divine\nagencies; the branch must abide in the vine....\nMany, oh, so many, among believers have scarcely food enough\nto eat, yet in their deep poverty they bring their tithes and offerings\nto the Lord\u2019s treasury. Many who know what it is to sustain the\ncause of God in hard and trying circumstances have invested means\nin the publishing house.

No more fragrant influence can ascend to heaven.\nTheir prayers and their alms come up as a memorial before God.\nBut the work of God in all its wide extent is one, and the same [213]\nprinciples should control, the same spirit be revealed, in all its\nbranches. It must bear the stamp of missionary work. Every depart-\nment of the cause is related to all parts of the gospel field, and the\nspirit that controls one department, will be felt throughout the entire\nfield. If a portion of the workers receive so large wages, there are\nothers, in different branches of the work, that will call for higher\nwages, and the spirit of self-sacrifice will become extinct at the great\nheart of the work. Other institutions will catch the same spirit, and\nthe Lord\u2019s favor will be removed from them, for He can never sanc-\ntion selfishness. Thus our aggressive work would come to an end.\nIt is possible to carry it forward only by continual sacrifice. From\nall parts of the world the calls are coming in for men and means to\ncarry forward the work. Shall we be compelled to say, \u201cYou must\nwait; we have no money in the treasury\u201d?\n204 Selected Messages Book 2\nBrother X knows the earlier history of the work in the office;\nhe knows the testimonies which God has sent to him and others in\nregard to self-denial and sacrifice. He is not ignorant of the many\nopening fields where the standard of truth is to be lifted, and where\nmeans are needed to establish the work. If he had the spirit of Christ,\nhe would reveal the mind of Christ.\nDeserters from the Army of the Lord\nIn severing his connection with the work of God in the office,\nBrother X has done just what I had feared he would do. Had he\ndenied self, standing at his post in obedience to the will of God and\nbecause this is the work of God, putting his whole heart into the work\nand bearing its responsibilities and burdens as others have borne\nthem before him, even though he should not gain as much financially\nas in business for himself\u2014had he done this, he would have made it\nmanifest that he was not a timeserver. But how great was his interest\nfor the office, if he could step out when he pleased, when it appeared\nto be for his interest to do so? Ought the soldiers in Christ\u2019s ranks to[214]\nact in this way? Should soldiers in the army of the nation do this, they\nwould be treated as deserters, and how does the heavenly universe\nlook upon such soldiers in Christ\u2019s army? No one who engages in\nthe work of God with an appreciation of its sacredness, could turn\nfrom the work to secure any worldly advantages whatsoever.\nBrother Y , God has been very merciful to you and Brother X.\nLife, that has been so precarious with you both, He has graciously\nspared. Days, months, and years have been granted, bringing you\nopportunities to develop character. God has placed you in connection\nwith His work, that you might become imbued with the spirit of\nChrist. Every day, every hour, comes to you as a blood-bought\nprivilege, that you may not only work out your own salvation, but\nmay be an agent in bringing souls to Christ, building up His kingdom,\nand making manifest the glory of God. God calls for heart and\ndevotion to the work. Those who are indeed laborers together with\nGod, will carry the burden of the work, and like the minister whom\nHe shall send, they will feel, \u201cWoe is me if I fail to stand faithful\nand true to my position of trust.\u201d\nCounsel to One Who for Financial Reasons Was Planning to Leave the Work of\nGod 205\nMy brother, if you have no more heart interest in the work than\nis indicated by the fact that you can drop it so easily, I have nothing\nto say, no plea to make for you to remain in the office, or for Brother\nX to return to it. You both reveal that you are not men that can be\ndepended upon. And an example that would be given in offering\nyou additional inducements to remain would not be pleasing to God.\nI would not for one moment present to you or any other man a\nbribe of dollars and cents to hold you in connection with the work,\nwhatever inconvenience it might suffer for a time because of your\nwithdrawal from it. Christ stands at the helm. If His Spirit does not\nmake you willing to be anything or do anything for the truth\u2019s sake,\nthen you can learn that lesson only by passing through trial. God\nwill test the faith of every soul. Christ has purchased us at an infinite\nsacrifice. Although He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, [215]\nthat we through His poverty might come in possession of eternal\nriches. All that we possess of ability and intellect is only that which\nthe Lord has lent us in trust to use for Him. It is our privilege to be\npartakers with Christ in His sacrifice if we will.\nThe men of experience and piety who led out in this work, who\ndenied self and did not hesitate to sacrifice anything for its success,\nare now sleeping in the grave. They were God\u2019s appointed channels\nthrough which the principles of spiritual life were communicated to\nthe church. They had an experience of the highest value. They could\nnot be bought or sold. Their purity and devotion and self-sacrifice,\ntheir living connection with God, were blessed to the upbuilding\nof the work. Our institutions were characterized by the spirit of\nself-sacrifice.\nBut in some respects the work has deteriorated. While it has\ngrown in extent and facilities, it has waned in piety. In the days when\nwe were struggling with poverty, those who saw how wondrously\nGod wrought for the upbuilding of the cause, felt that no greater\nhonor could be bestowed upon them than to be bound up with the\ninterests of the work by sacred links which connected them with\nGod. Would they lay down the burden and make terms with the Lord\nfrom a money standpoint? No, no. Should every timeserver forsake\nhis post of duty, they would never desert the work. They would say,\n\u201cIf the Lord placed me here, He desires me to be a faithful steward,\nlearning of Him day by day how to perform the work acceptably. I\n206 Selected Messages Book 2\nwill stand at my post until God shall release me. I will know what it\nmeans to be a practical, wholehearted Christian. I expect my reward\nby and by.\u201d\nThe believers who in the early history of the cause sacrificed\nfor the upbuilding of the work were imbued with the same spirit.\nThey felt that God demanded of all connected with His cause an\nunreserved consecration of soul, body, and spirit, of all their services\nand capabilities, to make the work a success. The testimonies came\nto them, claiming for God all their energies in cooperation with\nthe divine agencies, and all the increased ability gained through the[216]\nexercise of every faculty.\nBlighting Effects of Selfishness and Covetousness\nThose who can sever their connection with the Lord\u2019s work for\nsome worldly inducement, may think they have a degree of interest\nin the cause of God; but the selfishness and covetousness lurking\nin the human heart are most powerful passions, and the outcome of\nthe conflict is not a mere conjecture. Unless the soul is daily living\nupon Christ\u2019s flesh and drinking His blood, the godly element will\nbe overcome by the satanic. Selfishness and covetousness will bear\naway the victory. A self-confident, independent spirit will never\nenter into the kingdom of God. It is only those who are partakers\nwith Christ in His self-denial and sacrifice that will be partakers with\nHim in His glory.\nThose who realize, even in a limited degree, what redemption\nmeans to them and to their fellow men, will walk by faith, and\nthey will comprehend in some measure the vast needs of humanity.\nTheir hearts are moved to compassion as they behold the widespread\ndestitution in our world\u2014multitudes suffering for food and clothing,\nand the moral destitution of thousands upon thousands who are under\nthe shadow of a terrible doom, in comparison with which physical\nsuffering fades into nothingness. The religion of Jesus Christ has\ngained wonderful victories over human selfishness. The self-denial,\nthe self-sacrifice of Christ is ever before those who are co-workers\nwith Him, and the will of man becomes submerged in the will of\nGod\nCounsel to One Who for Financial Reasons Was Planning to Leave the Work of\nGod 207\nGod designs that all who are laborers together with Him should\nhave a rich experience in His love and His power to save. Never\nshould we say, \u201cI have no experience,\u201d for that God who gave Paul\nan experience will reveal Himself to every soul who will earnestly\nseek Him. What said God to Abraham? \u201cI know him,\u201d said the\nheart-searching God, \u201cthat he will command his children and his\nhousehold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do [217]\njustice and judgment\u201d (Genesis 18:19). Abraham would cultivate\nhome religion, and the fear of the Lord would lead to integrity of\nlife. He who blesses the habitation of the righteous says, \u201cI know\nhim that he will command.\u201d There is no betraying of sacred trusts,\nno hesitating between right and wrong. The Holy One has given\nrules for the guidance of all\u2014the standard of character from which\nnone can swerve and be guiltless. God\u2019s will is to be diligently and\nconscientiously studied, and it must be made paramount in all the\naffairs of life. The laws which every human agent is to obey flow\nfrom the heart of infinite love.\nThat same Holy Watcher who says, \u201cI know Abraham,\u201d knew\nCornelius also, and sent His angel with a message to the man who\nhad received and improved all the light God had given him. The\nangel said, \u201cThy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial\nbefore God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon,\nwhose surname is Peter.\u201d Then the specific directions are given,\n\u201cHe lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea\nside: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do\u201d (Acts 10:4-6).\nThus the angel of the Lord works to bring Cornelius in connection\nwith the human agent through whom he might receive greater light.\nStudy the whole chapter carefully and see the simplicity of the whole\ntransaction. Then consider that the Lord knows every one of us by\nname, and just where we live, and the spirit we possess, and every act\nof our life. The ministering angels are passing through the churches,\nnoting our faithfulness in our individual line of duty.\nThey take note also of our neglect of duty. Mark the case of\nAnanias and Sapphira. In pretending that they had consecrated their\nentire possession to God, they lied to the Holy Spirit, and as the\nresult of their deception they lost not only the life that now is, but that\nwhich is to come. It is sad for anyone to handle sacred things, and yet\nbring into the service their own peculiar traits of character, making\n208 Selected Messages Book 2\nGod to serve with their sins. God desires them, in their position of\ntrust, to exemplify the mind of Christ, but the objectionable traits of[218]\ncharacter are interwoven with all their work, and the sacred cause\nof God is marred by their selfishness. The Lord knows whether\nthose who carry the burden of responsibility are faithful stewards,\nmaintaining strict integrity in every transaction, and placing this\nimpress upon every phase of their work....\nYour heart is sad and grieved, but no longer deceive yourself, or\nexpect that men and women will value the light that God has given\nthem from His own holiness, until they shall open their hearts to\nJesus. \u201cLean on Me,\u201d He says, \u201ctrust in Me: I will never fail you; I\nwill be to you a present help in every time of need.\u201d\nI have been shown that all who now occupy important positions\nin the Review office will be tested. If they will make Christ their pat-\ntern, He will give them wisdom and knowledge and understanding;\nthey will grow in grace and aptitude in Christ\u2019s way; their characters\nwill be molded after His similitude. If they fail to keep the way of\nthe Lord, another spirit will control the mind and judgment, and they\nwill devise plans without the Lord, and will take their own course,\nand leave the positions they have occupied. The light has been given\nthem; If they depart from it, and follow their own course, let no man\npresent a bribe to induce them to remain. They will be a hindrance\nand a snare. The time has come when everything is to be shaken\nthat can be shaken, that those things that cannot be shaken may\nremain.\u2014Letter 20a, 1893.\nSection 6\u2014Comfort and Encouragement [219]\n[220]\nIntroduction\nEllen G. White, the messenger of the Lord, knew the meaning\nof suffering. Her childhood hopes were blighted by an accident, at\nthe age of nine, which nearly cost her life. She passed through the\nexperiences of motherhood four times. Twice she was bereaved of a\nson. For nearly half of her public life she was a widow. She knew\nthe meaning of lingering illness. Her messages of encouragement to\nthose who were in affliction, to those who faced death, and to the\naged and the bereaved were tempered by her own experience.\nNo one can explain the mysteries of providence, but those who\nhave trusted God in times of trial and suffering know that God is\nworking out His plan. Mrs. White knew this and revealed it in her\nday-by-day journal for 1892 in which she jotted down, with diary\nterseness, her reaction to ten months of suffering in a strange land.\nHer disappointment in not being healed in response to prayer and\nanointing, and her unfaltering trust in God in life or death are here\nrevealed.\nThe personal messages written by Mrs. White under varying\ncircumstances, and presented here for the comfort of those who must\nsuffer, will help to answer the questions, why, if God is a God of\nlove, must His people suffer long illness? Why must they languish\non beds of pain? Comfort and encouragement will come to the\nperson who is passing through experiences of a character described\nin these pages. Whatever repetition occurs is merely for the purpose\nof bringing comfort in as many personal situations as possible.\nWhite Trustees.\n210\nChapter 24\u2014Words to Those in Advanced Years [221]\nThe Afternoon Sun\u2014Mellow and Productive\nThe true minister of Christ should make continual improvement.\nThe afternoon sun of his life may be more mellow and productive\nof fruit than the morning sun. It may continue to increase in size\nand brightness until it drops behind the western hills. My brethren\nin the ministry, it is better, far better, to die of hard work in some\nhome or foreign mission field, than to rust out with inaction. Be\nnot dismayed at difficulties; be not content to settle down without\nstudying and without making improvement. Search the Word of God\ndiligently for subjects that will instruct the ignorant and feed the\nflock of God. Become so full of the matter that you will be able to\nbring forth from the treasure house of His Word things new and old.\nYour experience should not be ten, twenty, or thirty years old,\nbut you should have a daily, living experience, that you may be able\nto give to each his portion of meat in due season. Look forward, not\nbackward. Never be obliged to tug at your memory in order to relate\nsome past experience. What does that amount to today to you or to\nothers? While you treasure all that is good in your past experience, [222]\nyou want a brighter, fresher experience as you pass along. Do not\nboast of what you have done in the past, but show what you can\ndo now. Let your works and not your words praise you. Prove the\npromise of God that \u201cthose that be planted in the house of the Lord\nshall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth\nfruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; to shew that the\nLord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness\nin him\u201d (Psalm 92:13-15). Keep your heart and mind young by\ncontinuous exercise.\u2014The Review and Herald, April 6, 1886.\nNo Excuse for Relaxing Self-Discipline\nI have heard those who have been in the faith for years, say\nthat they used to be able to endure trial and difficulty, but since the\n211\n212 Selected Messages Book 2\ninfirmities of age began to press upon them, they had been greatly\ndistressed when brought under discipline. What does this mean?\nDoes it mean that Jesus has ceased to be your Saviour? Does it\nmean that when you are old and gray-headed, you are privileged\nto display unholy passion? Think of this. You should use your\nreasoning powers in this matter, as you do in temporal things. You\nshould deny self, and make your service to God the first business\nof your life. You must not permit anything to disturb your peace.\nThere is no need of it; there must be a constant growth, a constant\nprogress in the divine life.\nChrist is the ladder that Jacob saw, whose base rests upon the\nearth, and whose topmost round reaches into the highest heaven;\nand round after round, you must mount this ladder until you reach\nthe everlasting kingdom. There is no excuse for becoming more like\nSatan, more like human nature. God has set before us the height of\nthe Christian\u2019s privilege, and it is \u201cto be strengthened with might\nby his Spirit in the inner man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts\nby faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able\nto comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and\ndepth, and height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth[223]\nknowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God\u201d\n(Ephesians 3:16-19).\u2014The Review and Herald, October 1, 1889.\nTo Rise Up and Call Them Blessed\nAt half past two o\u2019clock P.M. I spoke to a full house [at Adams\nCenter, N.Y .].... We were gratified to meet the aged servants of God\non this occasion. We have been acquainted from the rise of the third\nangel\u2019s message with Elder [Frederick] Wheeler, who is now nearing\neighty years. We have been acquainted with Elders [H. H.] Wilcox\nand [Chas. O.] Taylor for the last forty years. Age is telling on these\nold standard-bearers, as well as upon me. If we are faithful to the\nend the Lord will give us a crown of life that fadeth not away.\nThe aged standard-bearers are far from being useless and laid\naside. They have a part to act in the work similar to that of John.\nThey can say, \u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have\nheard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked\nupon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the\nWords to Those in Advanced Years 213\nlife was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and\nshew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was\nmanifested unto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we\nunto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our\nfellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. And\nthese things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. This then\nis the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you,\nthat God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we\nhave fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not\nthe truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have\nfellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son\ncleanseth us from all sin\u201d (1 John 1:1-7).\nThis was the spirit and life of the message that John bore to all in\nhis old age, when he was nearly one hundred years old. The standard-\nbearers are holding fast their banners. They are not loosening their [224]\nhands on the banner of truth until they lay off the armor. One by one\nthe old warriors\u2019 voices become silent. Their place is vacant. We\nsee them no more, but they being dead yet speak, for their works\ndo follow them. Let us treat very tenderly the few aged pilgrims\nremaining, esteeming them highly for their works\u2019 sake. As their\npowers are becoming worn and enfeebled, what they do say is of\nvalue. As precious testimony let their words be treasured. Let not\nthe young men and the new workers discard or in any respect show\nindifference to the men of hoary hairs, but let them rise up and\ncall them blessed. They should consider that they have themselves\nentered into these men\u2019s labors. We wish that there was much more\nof the love of Christ in the hearts of our believers for those who were\nfirst in the proclamation of the message.\u2014Manuscript 33, 1890.\nCounsel to Those Who Have Grown Gray in Service\nA Caution to Elder S. N. Haskell\nWhile you are anxious to do all that you possibly can, remember,\nElder Haskell, that it is only by the great mercy and grace of God\nthat you have been spared these many years to bear your testimony.\nDo not take upon yourself loads that others who are younger can\ncarry.\n214 Selected Messages Book 2\nIt is your duty to be careful in your habits of life. You are to be\nwise in the use of your physical, mental, and spiritual strength. We\nwho have passed through so many and such varied experiences are\nto do all that it is possible for us to do to preserve our powers, that\nwe may labor for the Lord as long as He permits us to stand in our\nlot to help to advance His work.\nThe cause needs the help of the old hands, the aged workers,\nwho have had many years\u2019 experience in the cause of God; who have\nseen many going into fanaticism, cherishing the delusion of false\ntheories, and resisting all the efforts made to let the true light shine\nforth in the darkness to reveal the superstitions that were coming\nin to confuse judgment, and to make of none effect the message of[225]\ntruth that in these last days must be given in its purity to the remnant\npeople of God.\nMany of the tried servants of God have fallen asleep in Jesus.\nWe greatly appreciate the help of those who are left alive to this day.\nWe value their testimony. Read the first chapter of First John, and\nthen praise the Lord that notwithstanding your many infirmities you\ncan still bear witness for Him....\nElders Smith and Loughborough\nWe can easily count the first burden bearers now alive [1902].\nElder [Uriah] Smith was connected with us at the beginning of the\npublishing work. He labored in connection with my husband. We\nhope always to see his name in the Review and Herald at the head of\nthe list of editors; for thus it should be. Those who began the work,\nwho fought bravely when the battle went so hard, must not lose their\nhold now. They are to be honored by those who entered the work\nafter the hardest privation had been borne.\nI feel very tender toward Elder Smith. My life interest in the\npublishing work is bound up with his. He came to us as a young man,\npossessing talents that qualified him to stand in his lot and place\nas an editor. How I rejoice as I read his articles in the Review\u2014so\nexcellent, so full of spiritual truth. I thank God for them. I feel a\nstrong sympathy for Elder Smith, and I believe that his name should\nalways appear in the Review as the name of the leading editor. Thus\nGod would have it. When, some years ago, his name was placed\nWords to Those in Advanced Years 215\nsecond, I felt hurt. When it was again placed first, I wept, and said,\n\u201cThank God.\u201d May it always be there, as God designs it shall be,\nwhile Elder Smith\u2019s right hand can hold a pen. And when the power\nof his hand fails, let his sons write at his dictation.\nI am thankful that Elder [J. N.] Loughborough can still use his\nabilities and his gifts in God\u2019s work. He has stood faithful amid\nstorm and trial. With Elder Smith, my husband, Brother Butler, who\njoined us at a later period, and yourself [S. N. Haskell], he can say, [226]\n\u201cThat which was from the beginning, ... that which we have seen\nand heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship\nwith us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son\nJesus Christ\u201d (1 John 1:1-3).\nElder Butler a Most Valuable Laborer\nIt is with feelings of satisfaction and of gratitude to God that we\nsee Elder [G. I.] Butler again in active service. His gray hairs testify\nthat he understands what trials are. We welcome him into our ranks\nonce more, and regard him as one of our most valuable laborers.\nMay the Lord help the brethren who have borne their testimony in\nthe early days of the message, to be wise in regard to the preservation\nof their physical, mental, and spiritual powers. I have been instructed\nby the Lord to say that He has endowed you with the power of reason,\nand He desires you to understand the laws that affect the health of\nthe being, and to resolve to obey them. These laws are God\u2019s laws.\nHe desires every pioneer worker to stand in his lot and place, that he\nmay do his part in saving the people from being swept downward\nto destruction by the mighty current of evil\u2014of physical, mental,\nand spiritual declension. My brethren, He desires you to keep your\narmor on to the very close of the conflict. Do not be imprudent; do\nnot overwork. Take periods of rest.\nThe church militant is not the church triumphant. The Lord\ndesires His tried servants, as long as they live, to advocate temper-\nance reform. Unfurl the temperance banner. Teach the people to\npractice strict temperance in all things, and to be champions in favor\nof obedience to physical laws. Stand firmly for God\u2019s truth. Exalt\nbefore the people the banner bearing the inscription, \u201cHere is the\n216 Selected Messages Book 2\npatience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of\nGod, and the faith of Jesus\u201d (Revelation 14:12)....\nTo Respect and Honor the Pioneers\nA few of the old standard-bearers are still living. I am intensely\ndesirous that our brethren and sisters shall respect and honor these[227]\npioneers. We present them before you as men who know what trials\nare. I am instructed to say, Let every believer respect the men who\nacted a prominent part during the early days of the message, and\nwho have borne trials and hardships and many privations. These\nmen have grown gray in service. Not long hence they will receive\ntheir reward....\nThe Lord desires His servants who have grown gray in the ad-\nvocacy of truth to stand faithful and true, bearing their testimony in\nfavor of the law.\nGod\u2019s tried servants must not be put in hard places. Those who\nserved their Master when the work went hard, those who endured\npoverty and remained faithful in the love of the truth when our\nnumbers were small, are ever to be honored and respected. Let those\nwho have come into the truth in later years take heed to these words.\nGod desires all to heed this caution.\u2014Letter 47, 1902.\nAged Workers to Be Teachers and Counselors\nGod calls upon His aged servants to act as counselors, to teach\nthe young men what to do in cases of emergency. Aged workers are\nto bear, as did John, a living testimony of real experience. And when\nthese faithful workers are laid away to rest, with the words, \u201cBlessed\nare the dead which die in the Lord\u201d (Revelation 14:13), there should\nbe found in our schools men and women who can take the standard\nand raise it in new places.\nWhile the aged standard-bearers are in the field, let those who\nhave been benefited by their labors care for and respect them. Do not\nload them down with burdens. Appreciate their advice, their words\nof counsel. Treat them as fathers and mothers who have borne the\nburden of the work. The workers who have in the past anticipated the\nneeds of the cause do a noble work when, in the place of carrying all\nWords to Those in Advanced Years 217\nthe burdens themselves, they lay them upon the shoulders of younger\nmen and women, and educate them as Elijah educated Elisha.\nDavid offered to God a tribute of gratitude for the divine teaching\nand guidance he had received. \u201cO God, thou hast taught me from my [228]\nyouth\u201d (Psalm 71:17), he declared. Those who in the history of the\nmessage have borne the burden and heat of the day, are to remember\nthat the same Lord who taught them from their youth, inviting them,\n\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me\u201d (Matthew 11:29), and\ngiving them the light of truth, is just as willing to teach young men\nand women today as He was to teach them.\nRelieved of Taxing Burdens\nIt is wisdom for those who have borne heavy loads to come\napart and rest awhile. These faithful workers should be relieved of\nevery taxing burden. The work they can do as educators should be\nappreciated. The Lord Himself will cooperate with them in their\nefforts to teach others. They should leave the wrestling to those who\nare younger; the future work must be done by strong young men.\nThe work is under the control of the Author and Finisher of our faith.\nHe can and will give fitness to men of opportunity. He will raise up\nthose who can fight His battles. He never leaves His work to chance.\nThis work is a great and solemn one, and it is to go forward.\nIt is not God\u2019s will that the fathers in His cause should use up\ntheir remaining vitality in bearing heavy loads. Let the young men\nshoulder every responsibility they can, and fight manfully the good\nfight of faith. The Lord knows better whom to select to do His\nwork than do the wisest men, however interested they may be. It is\nGod who implants His Spirit in the hearts of young men, leading\nthem to fight for Him against great odds. Thus He inspired Paul of\nTarsus, who fought with all his entrusted capabilities for Heaven\u2019s\nrevealed truth, against apostates who ought to have upheld him.\nGod\u2019s servants will have today to meet the same difficulties that Paul\nmet. This experience some have had who are now raising the banner\nof truth. It is such men who can stand in defense of the truth. If they\ncontinue to be learners, God can use them to vindicate His law.\n218 Selected Messages Book 2\nYoung Men to Unite With Experienced Workers[229]\nLet not the aged workers think that they must carry all the respon-\nsibilities, all the loads. New fields of labor are constantly opening\nbefore us. Let the young men unite with experienced laborers who\nunderstand the Scriptures, who have long been doers of the Word,\nwho have brought the truth into the practical life, relying upon Christ\nday by day, who seek the Lord as Daniel did. Three times a day\nDaniel offered his petitions to God. He knew that One mighty in\ncounsel was the source of wisdom and power. The truth as it is\nin Jesus\u2014the sword of the Spirit, which cuts both ways\u2014was his\nweapon of warfare.\nIn word, in spirit, in principle, the men who have made God\ntheir trust are an example to the youth connected with them. These\nfaithful servants of God are to link up with young men, drawing\nthem with the cords of love because they are themselves drawn to\nthem by the cords of Christ\u2019s love.\u2014The Review and Herald, March\n20, 1900.\nGrowing Old but Continuing to Testify\nDear Brother [G. I.] Butler,\nI greatly desire that the old soldiers, grown gray in the Master\u2019s\nservice, shall continue to bear their testimony right to the point, that\nthose younger in the faith may understand that the messages which\nthe Lord gave us in the past are very important at this stage of the\nearth\u2019s history. Our past experience has not lost one jot of its force.\nI thank the Lord for every jot and tittle of the Sacred Word. I would\nnot draw back from the hard parts of our experience.\nYou must not work beyond your strength. I suppose that in the\nfuture our experience will be varied; but I think that you and I in\ngrowing old in the service of Christ, in doing His will, are obtaining\nan experience of the highest value and most intense interest.\nThe judgments of the Lord are in the land. We must work with\nwholehearted fidelity, putting the whole being into what we do to\nhelp others move forward and upward. Let us press the battle to the[230]\ngates. Let us be ever ready to speak words of encouragement to the\nhalting and the weary. We can walk safely only as we walk with\nWords to Those in Advanced Years 219\nChrist. Let nothing dampen your courage. Help those with whom\nyou come in contact to work with fidelity.\nI hope that in the future I may meet you at some of our gatherings.\nYou and I are among the oldest of those living who have long kept\nthe faith. If we should not live to see our Lord\u2019s appearing, yet,\nhaving done our appointed work, we shall lay off our armor with\nsanctified dignity. Let us do our best, and let us do it in faith and\nhope. My heart is filled with gratitude to the Lord for sparing my\nlife for so long. My right hand can still trace subjects of Bible truth\nwithout trembling. Tell all that Sister White\u2019s hand still traces words\nof instruction for the people. I am completing another book on Old\nTestament history. [Reference here is to Prophets and Kings.]\nMay the Lord bless you and keep you in hope and courage.\u2014\nLetter 130, 1910.\nLess Constant Taxing Labor\nDear Brother [S. N.] Haskell,\nI urge you not to work above that which you are able to do. You\nshould have less constant, taxing labor, that you may be able to\nkeep yourself in a rested condition. You should take a sleep in the\ndaytime. You can then think more readily, and your thoughts will be\nmore clear and your words more convincing. And be sure to bring\nyour whole being into connection with God. Accept the Holy Spirit\nfor your spiritual illumination, and under its guidance follow on to\nknow the Lord. Go forth where the Lord directs, doing what He\ncommands. Wait on the Lord, and He will renew your strength.\nBut it is not required of you or of me to be on a continual strain.\nWe should surrender continually what He requires of us, and He\nwill show us His covenant. \u201cThe secret of the Lord is with them\nthat fear him\u201d (Psalm 25:14). We shall be instructed more deeply in\nthe mystery of God the Father and of Jesus Christ. We shall have [231]\nvisions of the King in His beauty, and before us will be opened the\nrest that remaineth for the people of God. We will soon enter the\ncity whose builder and maker is God\u2014the city we have long talked\nof.\u2014Letter 78, 1906.\n220 Selected Messages Book 2\nTrust God\u2014Lean Upon Him\nDear Sister [S. N.] Haskell,\nNow when you can no longer be active, and infirmities press\nupon you, all that God requires of you is to trust Him. Commit the\nkeeping of your soul to Him as unto a faithful Creator. His mercies\nare sure, His covenant is everlasting. Happy is the man whose hope\nis in the Lord his God, who keepeth truth forever. Let your mind\ngrasp the promises and hold to them. If you cannot call to mind\nreadily the rich assurance contained in the precious promises, listen\nto them from the lips of another. What fullness, what love and\nassurance are found in these words from the lips of God Himself,\nproclaiming His love, His pity and interest in the children of His\ncare:\n\u201cThe Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering,\nand abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,\nforgiving iniquity and transgression and sin\u201d (Exodus 34:6, 7).\nThe Lord is full of compassion for His suffering ones. What sins\nare too great for His pardon? He is merciful, and as such is infinitely\nmore ready and more pleased to pardon than to condemn. He is\ngracious, not looking for wrong in us; He knoweth our frame; He\nremembereth that we are but dust. In His boundless compassion and\nmercy He heals all our backslidings, loving us freely while we are\nyet sinners, withdrawing not His light, but shining on us for Christ\u2019s\nsake.\nWill you, my sister, always trust in Jesus, who is your righteous-\nness? The love of God is shed abroad in your heart by the Holy\nGhost, which is graciously given unto you. You are one with Christ.\nHe will give you grace to be patient, He will give you grace to be\ntrustful, He will give you grace to overcome restlessness, He will[232]\nwarm your heart with His own sweet Spirit, He will revive your\nsoul in its weakness. Only a few days more to be as pilgrims and\nstrangers in this world, seeking for a better country, even an heav-\nenly. Our home is in heaven. Then stay your soul in confidence\nupon God. Roll all your burdens upon Him.\nOh, how many times has your heart been touched with the beauty\nof the Saviour\u2019s countenance, charmed with the loveliness of His\ncharacter, and subdued with the thought of His suffering. Now He\nWords to Those in Advanced Years 221\nwants you to lean your whole weight upon Him. I will give you a\nchapter to comfort you at all times. \u201cAnd in that day thou shalt say,\nO Lord, I will praise Thee: though Thou wast angry with me, Thine\nanger is turned away, and Thou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my\nsalvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my\nstrength and my song; He also is become my salvation. Therefore\nwith joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation\u201d (Isaiah\n12:1-3).\u2014Letter 14b, 1891.\nChapter 25\u2014Fortitude in Affliction[233]\nWhy This Affliction\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 9.]\n[Late in 1891, Ellen G. White, in response to a request from\nthe General Conference, journeyed to Australia to assist in strength-\nening the newly established work there. The sojourn extended to\nnine years. Soon after her arrival she was overtaken by an extended\nand painful illness. The following items record her fortitude in this\naffliction. Take note of the lessons she learned from this experi-\nence.\u2014Compilers.]\nEvery mail has taken from one to two hundred pages from my\nhand, and most of it has been written either as I am now propped\nup on the bed by pillows, half lying or half sitting, or bolstered up\nsitting in an uncomfortable chair.\nIt is very painful to my hip and to the lower part of my spine to sit\nup. If such easy chairs were to be found in this country [Australia]\nas you have at the sanitarium, one would be readily purchased by\nme, if it cost thirty dollars.. . . It is with great weariness that I can\nsit erect and hold up my head. I must rest it against the back of the\nchair on the pillows, half reclining. This is my condition just now.\nBut I am not at all discouraged. I feel that I am sustained daily.\nIn the long weary hours of the night, when sleep has been out of\nthe question, I have devoted much time to prayer; and when every[234]\nnerve seemed to be shrieking with pain, when if I considered myself,\nit seemed I should go frantic, the peace of Christ has come into\nmy heart in such measure that I have been filled with gratitude and\nthanksgiving. I know that Jesus loves me, and I love Jesus. Some\nnights I have slept three hours, a few nights four hours, and much\nof the time only two, and yet in these long Australian nights, in the\ndarkness, all seems light about me, and I enjoy sweet communion\nwith God.\n222\nFortitude in Affliction 223\nWhen I first found myself in a state of helplessness I deeply re-\ngretted having crossed the broad waters. Why was I not in America?\nWhy at such expense was I in this country? Time and again I could\nhave buried my face in the bed quilts and had a good cry. But I did\nnot long indulge in the luxury of tears.\nI said to myself, \u201cEllen G. White, what do you mean? Have you\nnot come to Australia because you felt that it was your duty to go\nwhere the conference judged it best for you to go? Has this not been\nyour practice?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cThen why do you feel almost forsaken and discouraged? Is not\nthis the enemy\u2019s work?\u201d\nI said, \u201cI believe it is.\u201d\nI dried my tears as quickly as possible and said, \u201cIt is enough; I\nwill not look on the dark side any more. Live or die, I commit the\nkeeping of my soul to Him who died for me.\u201d\nI then believed that the Lord would do all things well, and during\nthis eight months of helplessness, I have not had any despondency or\ndoubt. I now look at this matter as a part of the Lord\u2019s great plan, for\nthe good of His people here in this country, and for those in America,\nand for my good. I cannot explain why or how, but I believe it. And\nI am happy in my affliction. I can trust my heavenly Father. I will\nnot doubt His love. I have an ever-watchful guardian day and night,\nand I will praise the Lord, for His praise is upon my lips because it\ncomes from a heart full of gratitude\u2014Letter 18a, 1892.\nMeditations Through Days of Affliction [235]\nPrayer and Anointing\u2014but Not Instantly Healed\nMay 21, 1892 \u2014The trying, almost sleepless night is ended.\nYesterday afternoon Elder [A. G.] Daniells and his wife, Elder [G.\nC.] Tenney and his wife, and Brethren Stockton and Smith came to\nour house at my request to pray that the Lord would heal me. We\nhad a most earnest season of prayer, and we were all much blessed.\nI was relieved, but not restored. I have now done all that I can to\nfollow the Bible directions, and I shall wait for the Lord to work,\n224 Selected Messages Book 2\nbelieving that in His own good time He will heal me. My faith takes\nhold of the promise, \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive\u201d (John 16:24).\nI believe that the Lord heard our prayers. I hoped that my cap-\ntivity might be turned immediately, and to my finite judgment it\nseemed that thus God would be glorified. I was much blessed during\nour season of prayer, and I shall hold fast to the assurance then given\nme: \u201cI am your Redeemer; I will heal you.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\n\u201cI Shall Not Lose Self-control\u201d\nJune 23, 1892 \u2014Another night has passed. I slept only three\nhours. I was not in so much pain as usual, but was restless and\nnervous. After lying awake for some time, trying to sleep, I gave\nup the effort, and directed my whole attention to seeking the Lord.\nHow precious to me was the promise, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given\nyou; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you\u201d\n(Matthew 7:7). I prayed most earnestly to the Lord for comfort and\npeace, which the Lord Jesus alone can give. I want the blessing of\nthe Lord, so that, while suffering pain, I shall not lose self-control. I\ndare not trust in self for one moment.\nThe instant that Peter withdrew his eyes from Christ, that instant\nhe began to sink. When he realized his peril, and lifted his eyes and\nvoice to Jesus, crying, Save, Lord, or I perish, the hand ever ready\nto save the perishing took hold of him, and he was saved....\nIn my home I must daily seek peace and pursue it.... And al-[236]\nthough the body is suffering, and the nervous system enfeebled, we\nmust not think that we are at liberty to speak fretfully or to think that\nwe are not receiving all the attention we should have. When we give\nway to impatience, we drive the Spirit of God out of the heart, and\ngive place to the attributes of Satan.\nWhen we frame excuses for selfishness, for evil thinking and\nevil speaking, we are educating the soul in evil, and if we continue\nto do this, it will become a habit to yield to temptation. We are then\non Satan\u2019s ground, overcome, weak, and without courage.\nIf we trust in ourselves, we shall certainly fall. Christ says,\n\u201cAbide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself,\nexcept it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me\u201d\n(John 15:4).\nFortitude in Affliction 225\nWhat is the fruit that we are to bear? \u201cThe fruit of the Spirit is\nlove, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meek-\nness, temperance: against such there is no law\u201d (Galatians 5:22,\n23).\nAs I meditated on these things, I felt more and more deeply the\nsin of neglecting to keep the soul in the love of God. The Lord does\nnothing without our cooperation. When Christ prayed, Father, keep\nthem in Thy name, He did not mean that we should neglect to keep\nourselves in the love and faith of God. Alive unto God, through a\nliving union with Christ, we trust in the promises, constantly gaining\ngreater strength by beholding Jesus. What can change the heart or\nshake the confidence of the one who by beholding the Saviour is\nchanged into His likeness? Shall such a one be on the watch for\nslights? Shall his imagination center on self? Shall he allow little\nthings to destroy his peace of mind? He in whose heart Christ abides\nis willing to be pleased. He thinks no evil, and is content with the\nassurance that Jesus knows and values aright every soul for whom\nHe died. God says, \u201cI will make a man more precious than fine gold;\neven a man than the golden wedge of Ophir\u201d (Isaiah 13:12). Let this\nsatisfy the longing of the soul, and make us careful and guarded,\nvery ready to forgive others because God has forgiven us.\nThe happiness of life is made up of little things. It is in the [237]\npower of everyone to practice true Christlike courtesy. It is not the\npossession of splendid talents that will help us to overcome, but the\nconscientious performance of daily duties. The kind look, the lowly\nspirit, the contented disposition, the unaffected, sincere interest in\nthe welfare of others\u2014these things are helps in the Christian life.\nIf the love of Jesus fills the heart, this love will be manifested in\nthe life. We shall not show a determination to have our own way, a\nstubborn, selfish unwillingness to be happy or pleased. The health of\nthe body depends more upon heart healthfulness than many suppose.\nOne can imagine himself slighted, imagine that he is not in as\nhigh a position as he is capable of filling, and so make of himself a\nsupposed martyr. He is unhappy, but who is to blame? One thing\nis certain\u2014kindness and amiability of temper will do more to exalt\nhim than any supposed smartness with the curse of an ungenial\ndisposition.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\n226 Selected Messages Book 2\nJesus Knows Our Griefs and Pains\nJune 26, 1892 \u2014I am glad when the daylight comes, for the\nnights are long and wearisome. But when I cannot sleep, gratitude\nfills my heart as I think that One who never slumbers is watching\nover me for good. What a wonderful thought it is that Jesus knows\nall about the pains and griefs we bear. In all our afflictions He was\nafflicted. Some among our friends know nothing of human woe or\nphysical pain. They are never sick, and therefore they cannot enter\nfully into the feelings of those who are sick. But Jesus is touched\nwith the feeling of our infirmity. He is the great medical missionary.\nHe has taken humanity upon Himself, and has placed Himself at the\nhead of a new dispensation, in order that He may reconcile justice\nand compassion.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\n\u201cMake Me a Healthy, Fruit-bearing Branch\u201d\nJune 29, 1892\u2014My prayer on awaking is, Jesus, keep Thy child\ntoday. Take me under Thy guardianship. Make me a healthy, fruit-[238]\nbearing branch of the living Vine. \u201cWithout me,\u201d Christ says, \u201cye\ncan do nothing\u201d (John 15:5). In and through Christ we can do all\nthings.\nHe who was the adored of angels, who had listened to the music\nof the heavenly choir, was ever touched, while upon this earth, with\nthe sorrows of children, ever ready to listen to the story of their\nchildish woe. He often dried their tears, cheering them with the\ntender sympathy of His words, which seemed to hush their sorrows\nand make them forget their grief. The emblem in the form of a dove\nthat hovered over Jesus at His baptism represents His gentleness of\ncharacter.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\n\u201cLet No Unkind Words Be Spoken by Me\u201d\nJune 30, 1892 \u2014Another night of great weariness is nearly\npassed. Although I continue to suffer much pain, I know that I\nam not forsaken by my Saviour. My prayer is, Help me, Jesus, that I\nmay not dishonor Thee with my lips. Let no unkind words be spoken\nby me.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\nFortitude in Affliction 227\n\u201cI Will Not Complain\u201d\nJuly 6, 1892\u2014I am so thankful that I can tell the Lord all my\nfears and perplexities. I feel that I am under the shield of His wings.\nAn infidel once asked a God-fearing youth, \u201cHow great is the God\nyou worship?\u201d \u201cSo great,\u201d was the reply, \u201cthat He fills immensity,\nand yet so small that He dwells in every sanctified heart.\u201d\nO precious Saviour, I long for Thy salvation. \u201cAs the hart panteth\nafter the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee\u201d (Psalm 42:1).\nI long for a clearer view of Jesus. I love to think of His spotless life,\nto meditate upon His lessons. How many times I repeat the words,\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will\ngive you rest\u201d (Matthew 11:28).\nMuch of the time my body is full of pain, but I will not by\ncomplaining become unworthy of the name of Christian. I am\nassured that this lesson of suffering will be to the glory of God,\na means of warning others to avoid continuous labor under trying [239]\ncircumstances so unfavorable to health of the body.\u2014Manuscript\n19, 1892.\n\u201cThe Lord Strengthens Me\u201d\nJuly 7, 1892\u2014The Lord strengthens me by His grace to write\nimportant letters. The brethren frequently come to me for counsel. I\nfeel a strong assurance that this tedious affliction is for the glory of\nthe Lord. I will not murmur; for when I wake in the night, it seems\nthat Jesus is looking upon me. The fifty-first chapter of Isaiah is\nexceedingly precious to me. He bears all our burdens. I read this\nchapter with assurance and hope.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\nNo Thought of Beating a Retreat\nJuly 10, 1892\u2014I awoke Emily [Emily Campbell, Mrs. White\u2019s\ntraveling companion and secretary.] at five o\u2019clock to build my fire\nand help me to dress. I thank the Lord that I had a better night\u2019s rest\nthan usual. My wakeful hours I employ in prayer and meditation.\nThe question forces itself upon me, Why do I not receive the blessing\nof restoration to health? Shall I interpret these long months of\nsickness as evidences of the displeasure of God because I came to\nAustralia? I answer decidedly, No, I dare not do this. At times\n228 Selected Messages Book 2\nbefore leaving America I thought that the Lord did not require me\nto go to a country so far away, at my age and when I was prostrated\nby overwork. But I followed the voice of the [General] Conference,\nas I have ever tried to do at times when I had no clear light myself. I\ncame to Australia, and found the believers here in a condition where\nthey must have help. For weeks after reaching here I labored as\nearnestly as I have ever labored in my life. Words were given me to\nspeak in regard to the necessity of personal piety....\nI am in Australia, and I believe that I am just where the Lord\nwants me to be. Because suffering is my portion, I have no thought\nof beating a retreat. The blessed assurance is given me that Jesus\nis mine and that I am His child. The darkness is dispelled by the[240]\nbright beams of the Sun of Righteousness. Who can understand the\npain I suffer but the One who is afflicted in all our afflictions? To\nwhom can I speak but to Him who is touched with the feeling of our\ninfirmities, and who knows how to succor those who are tempted?\nWhen I pray earnestly for restoration, and it seems that the Lord\ndoes not answer, my spirit almost faints within me. Then it is that\nthe dear Saviour makes me mindful of His presence. He says to\nme, Cannot you trust Him who has purchased you with His own\nblood? I have graven thee on the palms of My hands. Then my soul\nis nourished with the divine Presence. I am lifted out of myself, as it\nwere, into the presence of God.\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\nGod Knows What Is Best\nJuly 14, 1892 \u2014When the affliction under which I have been\nsuffering for several months came upon me, I was surprised that it\nwas not removed at once in answer to prayer. But the promise, \u201cMy\ngrace is sufficient\u201d (2 Corinthians 12:9), has been fulfilled in my\ncase. There can be no doubt on my part. My hours of pain have\nbeen hours of prayer, for I have known to whom to take my sorrows.\nI have the privilege of reinforcing my feeble strength by laying hold\nupon infinite power. By day and night I stand on the solid rock of\nGod\u2019s promises.\nMy heart goes out to Jesus in loving trust. He knows what is\nbest for me. My nights would be lonely did I not claim the promise,\nFortitude in Affliction 229\n\u201cCall upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou\nshalt glorify Me\u201d (Psalm 50:15).\u2014Manuscript 19, 1892.\nLearned Lessons from the Months of Suffering\nI have been passing through great trial in pain and suffering and\nhelplessness, but through it all I have obtained a precious experience\nmore valuable to me than gold. When I was first convinced that I [241]\nmust give up my cherished plans to visit the churches in Australia\nand New Zealand, I felt to seriously question whether it was my duty\nto leave America and come to this far-off country. My sufferings\nwere acute. Many sleepless hours of the nights I spent in going over\nand over our experience since we left Europe for America, and it\nhas been a continual scene of anxiety, suffering, and burden bearing.\nThen I said, What does it all mean?\nI carefully reviewed the history of the past few years and the\nwork the Lord gave me to do. Not once did He fail me, and often\nHe manifested Himself to me in a marked manner, and I saw I had\nnothing of which to complain, but instead precious things running\nlike threads of gold through all my experience. The Lord understood\nbetter than I the things that I needed, and I felt that He was drawing\nme very nigh to Himself, and I must be careful not to dictate to God\nas to what He should do with me. This unreconciliation was at the\nbeginning of my sufferings and helplessness, but it was not long\nuntil I felt that my affliction was a part of God\u2019s plan. I found that\nby partly lying and partly sitting I could place myself in position to\nuse my crippled hands, and although suffering much pain I could do\nconsiderable writing. Since coming to this country I have written\nsixteen hundred pages of paper of this size.\n\u201cI Know Whom I Have Believed\u201d\nMany nights during the past nine months I was enabled to sleep\nbut two hours a night, and then at times darkness would gather about\nme; but I prayed, and realized much sweet comfort in drawing nigh\nto God. The promises, \u201cDraw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh\nto you\u201d (James 4:8), \u201cWhen the enemy shall come in like a flood,\nthe Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him\u201d (Isaiah\n59:19), were fulfilled to me. I was all light in the Lord. Jesus was\n230 Selected Messages Book 2\nsacredly near, and I found the grace given sufficient, for my soul\nwas stayed upon God, and I was full of grateful praise to Him who\nloved me and gave Himself for me. I could say from a full heart, \u201cI[242]\nknow whom I have believed\u201d (2 Timothy 1:12). \u201cGod is faithful,\nwho will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but\nwill with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be\nable to bear it\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:13). Through Jesus Christ I have\ncome off more than conqueror, and held the vantage ground.\nI cannot read the purpose of God in my affliction, but He knows\nwhat is best, and I will commit my soul, body, and spirit to Him as\nunto my faithful Creator. \u201cFor I know whom I have believed, and\nam persuaded that He is able to keep that which I have committed\nunto Him against that day\u201d (2 Timothy 1:12). If we educated and\ntrained our souls to have more faith, more love, greater patience,\nand a more perfect trust in our heavenly Father, I know we would\nhave more peace and happiness day by day as we pass through the\nconflicts of this life.\nThe Lord is not pleased to have us fret and worry ourselves out of\nthe arms of Jesus. More is needed of the quiet waiting and watching\ncombined. We think unless we have feeling that we are not in the\nright track, and we keep looking within for some sign befitting the\noccasion; but the reckoning is not of feeling but of faith.\nWalk by Faith\nWhen we comply with the written Word, according to our best\nknowledge, then we are to walk by faith, whether we feel any special\ngratification or not. We dishonor God when we show we do not trust\nHim after He has given us such wondrous evidences of His great\nlove in giving His only-begotten Son Jesus to die, our sacrifice, that\nwe may believe in Him, rest our hopes in Him, and trust in His Word\nwithout a question or doubt.\nKeep looking unto Jesus, offering up silent prayers in faith,\ntaking hold of His strength, whether you have any manifest feeling\nor not. Go right forward as if every prayer offered was lodged in the\nthrone of God and responded to by the One whose promises never\nfail. Go right along, singing and making melody to God in your\nhearts, even when depressed by a sense of weight and sadness. I[243]\nFortitude in Affliction 231\ntell you as one who knows, light will come, joy will be ours, and\nthe mists and clouds will be rolled back. And we pass from the\noppressive power of the shadow and darkness into the clear sunshine\nof His presence.\nIf we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the\nblessings that we know we have\u2014the great mercy, forbearance, and\nlove of God\u2014we would daily have greater strength. Have not the\nprecious words spoken by Christ, the Prince of God, an assurance\nand power that should have great influence upon us, that our heavenly\nFather is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him\nthan parents are to give good gifts to their children?\nWe should daily dedicate ourselves to God and believe He ac-\ncepts the sacrifice, without examining whether we have that degree\nof feeling that corresponds with our faith. Feeling and faith are\nas distinct as the east is from the west. Faith is not dependent on\nfeeling. We must earnestly cry to God in faith, feeling or no feeling,\nand then live our prayers. Our assurance and evidence is God\u2019s\nword, and after we have asked we must believe without doubting. I\npraise Thee, O God, I praise Thee. Thou hast not failed me in the\nperformance of Thy word. Thou hast revealed Thyself unto me and\nI am Thine to do Thy will.\nWatch as faithfully as did Abraham lest the ravens or any birds of\nprey alight upon your sacrifice and offering to God. Every thought\nof doubt should be so guarded that it will not see the light of day by\nutterance. Light always flees from words which honor the powers of\ndarkness. The life of our risen Lord should be daily manifested in\nus.\nThe Path to Heaven Narrow and Inconvenient\nWhat is our path to heaven? Is it a road with every inviting\nconvenience? No, it is a path that is narrow and apparently incon-\nvenient; it is a path of conflict, of trial, of tribulation and suffering.\nOur Captain, Jesus Christ, has hid nothing from us in regard to the [244]\nbattles we are to fight. He opens the map before us and shows us the\nway. \u201cStrive,\u201d He says, \u201cto enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say\nunto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able\u201d (Luke 13:24).\n\u201cWide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,\n232 Selected Messages Book 2\nand many there be which go in thereat\u201d (Matthew 7:13). \u201cIn the\nworld ye shall have tribulation\u201d (John 16:33). The apostle echoes\nthe words of Christ, \u201cWe must through much tribulation enter into\nthe kingdom\u201d (Acts 14:22). Well, is it the discouraging aspect we\nare to keep before the mind\u2019s eye? ...\nGather Every Promise\nThis is Jesus, the life of every grace, the life of every promise,\nthe life of every ordinance, the life of every blessing. Jesus is the\nsubstance, the glory and fragrance, the very life itself. \u201cHe that\nfolloweth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of\nlife\u201d (John 8:12). Then the royal path cast up the ransomed to walk\nin is not discouraging darkness. Our pilgrimage would indeed be\nlonely and painful were it not for Jesus. \u201cI will not,\u201d He says, \u201cleave\nyou comfortless\u201d (John 14:18). Then let us gather every registered\npromise. Let us repeat them by day and meditate upon them in the\nnight season, and be happy.\n\u201cAnd in that day thou shalt say, O Lord, I will praise Thee:\nthough Thou wast angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and\nThou comfortedst me. Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and\nnot be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song; He\nalso is become my salvation. Therefore with joy shall ye draw water\nout of the wells of salvation. And in that day shall ye say, Praise\nthe Lord, call upon His name, declare His doings among the people,\nmake mention that His name is exalted. Sing unto the Lord; for\nHe hath done excellent things: this is known in all the earth. Cry\nout and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of\nIsrael in the midst of thee\u201d (Isaiah 12:1-6).\nIs not this indeed a royal path we are traveling, cast up for the[245]\nransomed of the Lord to walk in? Can there be provided a better\npath? A safer way? No! No! Then let us practice the instruction\ngiven. Let us see our Saviour as our refuge, as our shield on our\nright hand to defend us from the arrows of Satan.\nTemptations will assail, cares and darkness will oppress. When\nheart and flesh are ready to fail, who throws around us His everlasting\narms? Who applies the precious promise? Who brings to our\nremembrance words of assurance and hope? Whose grace is given\nFortitude in Affliction 233\nin rich measure to those who ask it in sincerity and truth? Who is\nit imputes to us His righteousness and saves us from sin? Whose\nlight rolls back the fog and mist and brings us into the sunshine of\nHis presence? O who but Jesus? Then love Him, then praise Him.\n\u201cRejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice\u201d (Philippians\n4:4). Is Jesus today a living Saviour? \u201cIf ye then be risen with Christ,\nseek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right\nhand of God\u201d (Colossians 3:1). We are risen with Christ. Christ is\nour life. Through His mercy and gracious love we are declared to be\nchosen, adopted, pardoned, and justified. Then let us magnify the\nLord.\u2014Letter 7, 1892.\nChapter 26\u2014Assurance to Those Facing Death[246]\nMessages of Comfort to a Daughter-in-Law Suffering\nAffliction\n[Mary Kelsey White, the wife of Wm.

I have faith in your case. I do believe\nthat the Lord has heard prayer in your behalf, and that He will work\nfor your good and His own name\u2019s glory. He has said, \u201cAsk what\nye will, and it shall be done unto you\u201d (John 15:7). \u201cWhatsoever ye\nshall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive\u201d (Matthew 21:22).\nI know that stormy times are before us, and we must know how\nto trust, how to lay hold on the Source of our strength.

You accept salvation as the\ngift of His grace, believing the promise because He has spoken it.\nLook to Jesus; this is my only comfort and hope. The Lord has\nbeen leading you along a path of painful humiliation. You have been\nemptied from vessel to vessel. You have been led by Him step by\nstep, deeper and still deeper into the valley, but only to bring you\ninto close communion with Jesus in His life of humiliation.\nIs there a step, my dear beloved child, that Jesus has not trodden\nwith you? Is there one pang of distress that He does not feel? Is there\none sin that He has not carried, a cross He has not borne, a sorrow\nthat he Has not sympathized with? He is touched with all the feeling\nof our infirmities. You are knowing what it is to fellowship with the\nsufferings of Christ. You are a partaker with Christ of His sufferings.\nYou brave, self-denying child, God knows it all. He passes to you a\ncup into which He pours a drop of His own sufferings. He places\nthe light end of the cross on your shoulders; He throws a shadow on\nyour soul....\nTrust yourself in the hands of Jesus. Do not worry. Do not think\nGod has forgotten to be gracious.

Mary can say with Paul, \u201cI have\nfought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:\nhenceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which\n238 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day: and not to\nme only, but unto all them also that love His appearing\u201d (2 Timothy\n4:7, 8).\nWhat should we do without a Saviour in the hour that tries the\nsoul?

The\neternal morning has come to them, for there will be no night in the\ncity of God.\nMary has manfully struggled through temptations and trials; she\nhath done what she could.

I put my trust in\nGod and plead with Him for you and for myself. We are to have no\nanxieties or cares. Just put your trust in the Lord.

I know better.\nJust believe in His love, and take Him at His word No suspicion or\ndistrust is to take possession of our minds. No apprehension of the\ngreatness of God is to confuse our faith.

I\nhave, as it were, been brought before the great white throne, and\nhave seen my life as it will there appear. I can find nothing of which\nto boast, no merit that I can plead. \u201cUnworthy, unworthy of the least\nof Thy favors, O my God,\u201d is my cry. My only hope is in a crucified\nand risen Saviour. I claim the merits of the blood of Christ. Jesus\nwill save to the uttermost all who put their trust in Him.\nIt is sometimes hard for me to preserve a cheerful countenance\nwhen my heart is rent with anguish. But I would not permit my\nsorrow to cast a gloom upon all around me. Seasons of affliction\nand bereavement are often rendered more sorrowful and distressing\nthan they should be, because it is customary to give ourselves up\nto mourning without restraint. By the help of Jesus, I determined\nto shun this evil; but my resolution has been severely tested. My\nhusband\u2019s death was a heavy blow to me, more keenly felt because so\nsudden. As I saw the seal of death upon his countenance, my feelings\nwere almost insupportable. I longed to cry out in my anguish. But I\nknew that this could not save the life of my loved one, and I felt that\nit would be unchristian to give myself up to sorrow. I sought help\nand comfort from above, and the promises of God were verified to [268]\nme. The Lord\u2019s hand sustained me. It is a sin to indulge, without\nrestraint, in mourning and lamentation. By the grace of Christ, we\nmay be composed and even cheerful under sore trial.\nLet us learn a lesson of courage and fortitude from the last inter-\nview of Christ with His apostles. They were about to be separated.\nOur Saviour was entering the bloodstained path which would lead\nHim to Calvary. Never was scene more trying than that through\nwhich He was soon to pass. The apostles had heard the words of\nChrist foretelling His sufferings and death, and their hearts were\nheavy with sorrow, their minds distracted with doubt and fear. Yet\nthere were no loud outcries; there was no abandonment of grief.\nThose last solemn, momentous hours were spent by our Saviour in\n254 Selected Messages Book 2\nspeaking words of comfort and assurance to His disciples, and then\nall united in a hymn of praise....\nA Time for Prayer and Praise\nWhen difficulties and trials surround us, we should flee to God,\nand confidently expect help from Him who is mighty to save and\nstrong to deliver. We must ask for God\u2019s blessing if we would\nreceive it. Prayer is a duty and a necessity; but do we not neglect\npraise? Should we not oftener render thanksgiving to the Giver\nof all our blessings? We need to cultivate gratitude. We should\nfrequently contemplate and recount the mercies of God, and laud\nand glorify His holy name, even when we are passing through sorrow\nand affliction....\nThe Lord\u2019s merciful kindness is great toward us. He will never\nleave nor forsake those who trust in Him. If we would think and talk\nless of our trials, and more of the mercy and goodness of God, we\nwould find ourselves raised above much of our gloom and perplexity.\nMy brethren and sisters, you who feel that you are entering upon a\ndark path, and like the captives in Babylon must hang your harps\nupon the willows, let us make trial of cheerful song. You may\nsay, How can I sing, with this dark prospect before me, with this\nburden of sorrow and bereavement upon my soul? But have earthly[269]\nsorrows deprived us of the all-powerful Friend we have in Jesus?\nShould not the marvelous love of God in the gift of His dear Son\nbe a theme of continual rejoicing? When we bring our petitions\nto the throne of grace, let us not forget to offer also anthems of\nthanksgiving. \u201cWhoso offereth praise glorifieth Me\u201d (Psalm 50:23).\nAs long as our Saviour lives, we have cause for unceasing gratitude\nand praise.\u2014The Review and Herald, November 1, 1881.\nThe Glorious Resurrection Morning\nA Message to Friends on Pitcairn Island\nWe were made very sad last Thursday to learn of your deep\naffliction.

We extend our sympathy to\nBereaved 255\nthe children and members of the family who have been thus sorely\nbereaved, but we would point you to Jesus as your only hope and\nconsolation. The dear companion of our afflicted Brother McCoy,\nand the mother of the bereaved children whom she loved, is silent\nin death. But while we weep with those that weep, we joy at heart\nbecause this loved mother and daughter, and Brother Young, the\nelder of your church, and others who may have been removed by\ndeath, believed in and loved Jesus.\nLet the words of the apostle Paul comfort you: \u201cI would not have\nyou to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that\nye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if we believe\nthat Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in\nJesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word\nof the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming\nof the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord\nHimself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of\nthe archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ\nshall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught\nup together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and [270]\nso shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another\nwith these words\u201d (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).\nWe are not like the heathen, to have days and nights of mourning\nwhen nothing is heard but dismal chanting for the dead, for the\npurpose of arousing human sympathy. We are not to clothe ourselves\nwith mourning clothing and wear a mournful countenance, as though\nour friends and relatives were forever parted from us. John exclaims,\n\u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the\ncommandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. And I heard a voice\nfrom heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die\nin the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may\nrest from their labours; and their works do follow them\u201d (Revelation\n14:12, 13).\nHow appropriate are the words of John in the case of these loved\nones who sleep in Jesus. The Lord loved them, and the words spoken\nby them in their life, the labors of love which will be remembered,\nwill be repeated by others. Their earnest wholeheartedness in the\nwork of God leaves an example for others to follow, for the Holy\nSpirit has worked in them to will and to do of His good pleasure.\n256 Selected Messages Book 2\n\u201cBut if the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell\nin you, He that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken\nyour mortal bodies by is Spirit that dwelleth in you\u201d (Romans 8:11).\nO how precious are these words to every bereaved soul! Christ is\nour Guide and Comforter, who comforts us in all our tribulations.\nWhen He gives us a bitter draught to drink, He also holds a cup of\nblessing to our lips. He fills the heart with submission, with joy and\npeace in believing, and enables us to say submissively, Not my will,\nbut Thy will, O Lord, be done. \u201cThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath\ntaken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\u201d (Job 1:21). With this\nsubmission hope is resurrected, and the hand of faith lays hold upon\nthe hand of infinite power. \u201cHe that raised up Christ from the dead\nshall also quicken your mortal bodies by His Spirit that dwelleth in\nyou\u201d (Romans 8:11).\nThe very bodies that are sown in corruption will be raised in[271]\nincorruption. That which is sown in dishonor will be raised in glory;\nsown in weakness, it will be raised in power; sown a natural body, it\nwill be raised a spiritual body. The mortal bodies are quickened by\nHis Spirit that dwelleth in you.\nChrist claims all those as His who have believed in His name.\nThe vitalizing power of the Spirit of Christ dwelling in the mortal\nbody binds every believing soul to Jesus Christ. Those who believe\nin Jesus are sacred to His heart; for their life is hid with Christ in\nGod. The command will come from the Life-giver, \u201cAwake and\nsing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and\nthe earth shall cast out the dead\u201d (Isaiah 26:19).\nThe life-giver will call up His purchased possession in the first\nresurrection, and until that triumphant hour, when the last trump\nshall sound and the vast army shall come forth to eternal victory,\nevery sleeping saint will be kept in safety and will be guarded as\na precious jewel, who is known to God by name.

The only\nthing we have to fear on our part is that we shall not keep our eyes\ncontinually fixed upon Jesus, that we shall not have an eye single to\nthe glory of God, so that if we were called to lay down our armor\nand sleep in death we might not be ready to give an account of our\ntrust. Forget not for a moment that you are Christ\u2019s property, bought\nwith an infinite price, and that you are to glorify Him in your spirit,\nand in your body, which are His.\nBe of Good Comfort\nTo the afflicted ones I would say, Be of good comfort in the hope\nof the resurrection morning. The waters of which you have been\ndrinking are as bitter to your taste as were the waters of Marah to\nthe children of Israel in the wilderness, but Jesus can make them so\nsweet with His love. When Moses presented before the Lord the\nsad difficulties of the children of Israel, He did not present some\nnew remedy, but called their attention to that which was at hand; for\nthere was a bush or shrub which He had created that was to be cast\ninto the water to make the fountain sweet and pure. When this was\ndone, the suffering people could drink of the water with safety and\npleasure.\nBereaved 259\nGod has provided a balm for every wound. There is a balm in\nGilead, there is a physician there. Will you not now as never before\nstudy the Scriptures? Seek the Lord for wisdom in every emergency.\nIn every trial plead with Jesus to show you a way out of your troubles,\nthen your eyes will be opened to behold the remedy and to apply to\nyour case the healing promises that have been recorded in His Word.\nIn this way the enemy will find no place to lead you into mourning [274]\nand unbelief, but instead you will have faith and hope and courage in\nthe Lord. The Holy Spirit will give you clear discernment that you\nmay see and appropriate every blessing that will act as an antidote\nto grief, as a branch of healing to every draught of bitterness that is\nplaced to your lips. Every draught of bitterness will be mingled with\nthe love of Jesus, and in place of complaining of the bitterness, you\nwill realize that Jesus\u2019 love and grace are so mingled with sorrow\nthat it has been turned into subdued, holy, sanctified joy.\nWhen Henry White, our eldest son, lay dying, he said, \u201cA bed of\npain is a precious place when we have the presence of Jesus.\u201d When\nwe are obliged to drink of the bitter waters, turn away from the bitter\nto the precious and the bright. In trial grace can give the human\nsoul assurance, and when we stand at the deathbed and see how the\nChristian can bear suffering and go through the valley of death, we\ngather strength and courage to work, and we fail not, neither are we\ndiscouraged in leading souls to Jesus.\u2014Letter 65a, 1894.\nThe Best Comforters\nThose who have borne the greatest sorrows are frequently the\nones who carry the greatest comfort to others, bringing sunshine\nwherever they go. Such ones have been chastened and sweetened by\ntheir afflictions; they did not lose confidence in God when trouble\nassailed them, but clung closer to His protecting love. Such ones are\na living proof of the tender care of God, who makes the darkness as\nwell as the light, and chastens us for our good. Christ is the light\nof the world; in Him is no darkness. Precious light! Let us live in\nthat light! Bid adieu to sadness and repining. Rejoice in the Lord\nalways; and again I say, Rejoice.\u2014The Health Reformer, vol. 12,\nNo. 10, October, 1877.\n260 Selected Messages Book 2\nSection 7\u2014The Use of Medicinal Agencies [275]\n[276]\nIntroduction\nShortly after the organization of the General Conference of Sev-\nenth-day Adventists in May, 1863, at a time when the church num-\nbered 3,500 members, Ellen G. White received a vision calling the\nattention of Adventists to the importance of good health and the\nclose relationship between physical well-being and spiritual expe-\nrience. The light given touched a number of important phases of\nliving, including diet, value of fresh air, the use of water, healthful\nattire, exercise, rest, et cetera. Prominent in this important revelation\nof June 6, 1863, was light concerning the harmful effects of the\npoisonous drugs that physicians so freely prescribed.\nIn the subsequent years the great basic health-reform vision was\nfollowed by many visions opening up in more detail the principles\nand the application of principles that should guide in matters of\nretaining good health and the care of the sick, the call for medical\ninstitutions and the manner in which Seventh-day Adventists should\nconduct such institutions.\nOn these matters Mrs. White wrote much. Her first compre-\nhensive presentation appeared in 1864 in Spiritual Gifts,[Currently\navailable in facsimile reprint.] V olume 4, pages 120 to 151 in an\narticle entitled \u201cHealth.\u201d Mrs. White then expanded this thirty-page\nstatement into six separate articles for publication under the general\ntitle of \u201cDisease and its Causes.\u201d In 1865 these were embodied in\nthe six numbered pamphlets compiled by Elder and Mrs. White,\nentitled Health or How to Live, one E. G. White article appearing\nin each number. [The six articles in their entirety appear as an ap-\npendix to this volume, see pp. 409-479.] From time to time over\nthe next several decades the various journals of the denomination\ncarried articles by Mrs. White on the subject of health. In 1890 she\npresented A comprehensive picture of the health message in the first\nhalf of the book Christian Temperance and Bible Hygiene. In 1905\nshe published The Ministry of Healing, her climaxing volume on the\n262\nIntroduction 263\nsubject. This she intended for very wide distribution in America and\noverseas.\nIn each of her general presentations on health Mrs. White dis- [277]\ncussed poisonous drugs and their use in the treatment of the sick.\nThis phase of the subject\u2014prominent in the original health-reform\nvision\u2014filled eight of the thirty pages of her initial Spiritual Gifts\npresentation. She devoted one entire article in the \u201cDisease and its\nCauses\u201d series to the subject of drugs.\nNor was Ellen White\u2019s voice alone at the time. There were\ncertain physicians on both sides of the Atlantic who deplored the ab-\nsence of adequate diagnosis, and gravely questioned the use of many\ncommonly prescribed poisonous drugs. As a result gradual changes\ntook place in the treatment of the sick as regards the use of drugs.\nThese changes have been most rapid and striking in the years follow-\ning the first decade of the twentieth century, when modern medical\neducation, along scientific and experimental lines, developed.\nIn her earlier writings, particularly, Mrs. White made singularly\nstrong statements concerning the physicians of the time and con-\ncerning the use of drugs. In order rightly to evaluate these, one must\nknow something of the medical practices at the time the statements\nwere made. This knowledge can be gained by examining the medical\nliterature of those times and from reading the opening chapter of\nThe Story of Our Health Message, by D. E. Robinson.\nIn her books that deal specifically with the problems and work\nof the church and its members, Mrs. White devotes more space to\nthe subject of health and the care of the sick than to any other single\ntopic. These counsels are spread before the general public in the\nmore than two thousand pages of The Ministry of Healing, Medical\nMinistry, Counsels on Diet and Foods, Counsels on Health, and\nTemperance, and in articles in the Testimonies for the Church. The\nreader is directed to these sources for the full, balanced picture of\nthe health-reform message.\nThis volume contains four chapters composed of statements\ndrawn from various sources\u2014some published and some unpub-\nlished\u2014written mostly to medical personnel in connection with\nAdventist institutions. These statements illustrate the way Mrs.\nWhite herself applied the principles revealed to her in vision. In her\nvarious utterances on the subject of the care of the sick, she ever held\n264 Selected Messages Book 2\nup the ideal for which to strive. At the same time she recognized,\nas seen by the terminology used, that there were times and circum-\nstances in special situations when it was justifiable and necessary to[278]\nemploy even medications that were known to be poisonous.\nIt is significant that Ellen White gives us the assurance that\nChrist and the angels are present in the operating room attending and\nguiding the consecrated Christian physician in performing surgical\noperations. Before major surgery, the entire body is saturated with\na powerful and, in a sense, harmful drug, to the point of complete\nunconsciousness and to complete insensibility. By the same token,\nafter surgical procedures, the physician may find it necessary to\nadminister sedatives that almost certainly include drugs, to give\nrelief and prevent the patient from lapsing, from sheer pain, into a\nstate of surgical shock and, in some instances, possible death.\nAs they strive to know and follow God\u2019s will, not a few today are\nmaking inquiries similar to one expressed in the words of a medical\nstudent who in 1893 wrote to Mrs. White to ask her about the use of\ndrugs. In his letter he said:\n\u201cFrom our study of the Testimonies and the little work, How to\nLive, we can see that the Lord is strongly opposed to the use of drugs\nin our medical work....Several of the students are in doubt as to the\nmeaning of the word \u2018drug\u2019 as mentioned in How to Live. Does it\nrefer only to the stronger medicines as mercury, strychnine, arsenic,\nand such poisons, the things we medical students call \u2018drugs,\u2019 or\ndoes it also include the simpler remedies, as potassium, iodine,\nsquills, etc.? We know that our success will be proportionate to our\nadherence to God\u2019s methods. For this reason I have asked the above\nquestion.\u201d\nThe first item in chapter 28, which follows immediately, is Mrs.\nWhite\u2019s reply to the inquiry of that medical student.\nWhite Trustees.\nChapter 28\u2014Statements on the Use of Drugs [279]\nA Statement in Answer to Questions on Drugs\nYour questions, [See introductory note, pp. 276-278.] I will\nsay, are answered largely, if not definitely, in How to Live. Drug\npoisons mean the articles which you have mentioned. The simpler\nremedies are less harmful in proportion to their simplicity; but in\nvery many cases these are used when not at all necessary. There are\nsimple herbs and roots that every family may use for themselves and\nneed not call a physician any sooner than they would call a lawyer.\nI do not think that I can give you any definite line of medicines\ncompounded and dealt out by doctors, that are perfectly harmless.\nAnd yet it would not be wisdom to engage in controversy over this\nsubject.\nThe practitioners are very much in earnest in using their danger-\nous concoctions, and I am decidedly opposed to resorting to such\nthings. They never cure; they may change the difficulty to create\na worse one. Many of those who practice the prescribing of drugs,\nwould not take the same or give them to their children. If they have\nan intelligent knowledge of the human body, if they understand\nthe delicate, wonderful human machinery, they must know that we [280]\nare fearfully and wonderfully made, and that not a particle of these\nstrong drugs should be introduced into this human living organism.\nAs the matter was laid open before me, and the sad burden of the\nresult of drug medication, the light was given me that Seventh-day\nAdventists should establish health institutions discarding all these\nhealth-destroying inventions, and physicians should treat the sick\nupon hygienic principles. The great burden should be to have well-\ntrained nurses, and well-trained medical practitioners to educate\n\u201cprecept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little\nand there a little\u201d (Isaiah 28:10).\nTrain the people to correct habits and healthful practices, remem-\nbering that an ounce of preventive is of more value than a pound\n265\n266 Selected Messages Book 2\nof cure.

Her son, who traveled\nwith her and assisted her, reports the following:\n\u201cOne time while we were in Australia, a brother who had been\nacting as a missionary in the Islands, told mother of the sickness and\ndeath of his first-born son. He was seriously afflicted with malaria,\nand his father was advised to give him quinine, but in view of the\ncounsel in the testimonies to avoid the use of quinine he refused to\nadminister it, and his son died. When he met Sister White, he asked\nher this question: \u2018Would I have sinned to give the boy quinine when\nI knew of no other way to check malaria and when the prospect\nwas that he would die without it?\u2019 In reply she said, \u2018No, we are\nexpected to do the best we can. \u2019\u201d\u2014W.

When Dr. A came to the Health Retreat, she laid aside\nher knowledge and practice of hygiene, and administered the little\nhomeopathic doses for almost every ailment. This was against the\nlight God had given. Thus our people, who had been taught to avoid\ndrugs in almost every form, were receiving a different education.\u2014\nLetter 26a, 1889 (To a prominent physician in institutional work).\n268 Selected Messages Book 2\nStrong Drugs Need Not Be Used\u2014The first labors of a physi-\ncian should be to educate the sick and suffering in the very course\nthey should pursue to prevent disease. The greatest good can be\ndone by our trying to enlighten the minds of all we can obtain access\nto, as to the best course for them to pursue to prevent sickness and\nsuffering, and broken constitutions, and premature death. But those\nwho do not care to undertake work that taxes their physical and\nmental powers will be ready to prescribe drug medication, which\nlays a foundation in the human organism for a two-fold greater evil\nthan that which they claim to have relieved.\nA physician who has the moral courage to imperil his reputation\nin enlightening the understanding by plain facts, in showing the\nnature of disease and how to prevent it, and the dangerous practice\nof resorting to drugs, will have an uphill business, but he will live\nand let live.... He will, if a reformer, talk plainly in regard to the\nfalse appetites and ruinous self-indulgence, in dressing, in eating\nand drinking, in overtaxing to do a large amount of work in a given\ntime, which has a ruinous influence upon the temper, the physical[283]\nand mental powers....\nRight and correct habits, intelligently and perseveringly prac-\nticed, will be removing the cause for disease, and the strong drugs\nneed not be resorted to.

We are not\nexcusable if through ignorance we destroy God\u2019s building by taking\nStatements on the Use of Drugs 269\ninto our stomachs poisonous drugs under a variety of names we do\nnot understand.

He is introducing into the system a seed crop that will\nnever lose its destroying properties throughout the lifetime. I tell\nyou this because I dare not withhold it. Christ paid too much for\nman\u2019s redemption to have his body so ruthlessly treated as it has\nbeen by drug medication.\nYears ago the Lord revealed to me that institutions should be es-\ntablished for treating the sick without drugs.

Every noxious herb is of\nhis sowing, and by his ingenious methods of amalgamation he has\ncorrupted the earth with tares.\nThen shall physicians continue to resort to drugs, which leave a\ndeadly evil in the system, destroying that life which Christ came to [289]\nrestore? Christ\u2019s remedies cleanse the system. But Satan has tempted\nman to introduce into the system that which weakens the human\nmachinery, clogging and destroying the fine, beautiful arrangements\nof God. The drugs administered to the sick do not restore, but\ndestroy. Drugs never cure. Instead, they place in the system seeds\nwhich bear a very bitter harvest....\nOur Saviour is the restorer of the moral image of God in man.\nHe has supplied in the natural world remedies for the ills of man,\nthat His followers may have life and that they may have it more\nabundantly. We can with safety discard the concoctions which man\nhas used in the past.\nThe Lord has provided antidotes for diseases in simple plants,\nand these can be used by faith, with no denial of faith; for by using\nthe blessings provided by God for our benefit we are cooperating\nwith Him. He can use water and sunshine and the herbs which He\nUse of Remedies 275\nhas caused to grow, in healing maladies brought on by indiscretion\nor accident. We do not manifest a lack of faith when we ask God\nto bless His remedies. True faith will thank God for the knowledge\nof how to use these precious blessings in a way which will restore\nmental and physical vigor.\nThe body is to be carefully cared for, and in this the Lord de-\nmands the cooperation of the human agent. Man must become\nintelligent in regard to the treatment and use of brain, bone, and\nmuscle. The very best experience we can gain is to know our-\nselves.\u2014Manuscript 65, 1899 (General Manuscript).\nAll to Understand What to Do for Themselves\nYour question is, ... \u201cIn urgent cases, should we call in a worldly\nphysician, because the sanitarium doctors are all so busy that they\nhave no time to devote to outside practice?\u201d If the physicians are so [290]\nbusy that they cannot treat the sick outside of the institution, would\nit not be wiser for all to educate themselves in the use of simple\nremedies, than to venture to use drugs that are given a long name\nto hide their real qualities. Why need anyone be ignorant of God\u2019s\nremedies\u2014hot-water fomentations and cold and hot compresses. It\nis important to become familiar with the benefit of dieting in case of\nsickness. All should understand what to do [for] themselves. They\nmay call upon someone who understands nursing, but everyone\nshould have an intelligent knowledge of the house he lives in. All\nshould understand what to do in case of sickness.\nWere I sick, I would just as soon call in a lawyer as a physician\nfrom among general practitioners. [Mrs. White is here referring to\nthe \u201cgeneral practitioner\u201d of 1897 in the backwoods of Australia,\nfrom where she penned these words. The reader must keep in mind\nthat until the second decade of the twentieth century, physician\ntraining was largely unregulated and was often meager. In many\ninstances it was on an apprentice basis, supplemented at best by a\nshort period of training in a more or less orthodox medical school.\nThe medical profession was without well-established standards. The\nmainstay in the medications of the ordinary doctor was poisonous\ndrugs, often prescribed in large doses.\n276 Selected Messages Book 2\nThe following facts show clearly that Mrs. White\u2019s statement\nshould not be used to depreciate the labors of the carefully trained\nconscientious physician:\n1. Her many statements relative to the high calling and weighty\nresponsibilities of the physician;\n2. Her practice of consulting qualified physicians as attested by\nthe published record and by those who were members of her family;\n3.

I\nam determined to know, in straight English, the name of everything\nthat I introduce into my system.\nThose who make a practice of taking drugs sin against their[291]\nintelligence and endanger their whole afterlife. There are herbs that\nare harmless, the use of which will tide over many apparently serious\ndifficulties. But if all would seek to become intelligent in regard to\ntheir bodily necessities, sickness would be rare instead of common.\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\u2014Manuscript 86,\n1897 (General Manuscript, \u201cHealth Reform Principles,\u201d written from\nCooranbong, Australia).\nSimple Remedies in the Sanitarium Program\nI have received much instruction regarding the location of san-\nitariums. They should be a few miles distant from the large cities,\nand land should be secured in connection with them. Fruit and veg-\nUse of Remedies 277\netables should be cultivated, and the patients should be encouraged\nto take up outdoor work. Many who are suffering from pulmonary\ndisease might be cured if they would live in a climate where they\ncould be out-of-doors most of the year. Many who have died of\nconsumption might have lived if they had breathed more pure air.\nFresh outdoor air is as healing as medicine, and leaves no injurious\naftereffects.. . .\nIt would have been better if, from the first, all drugs had been\nkept out of our sanitariums, and use had been made of such simple\nremedies as are found in pure water, pure air, sunlight, and some\nof the simple herbs growing in the field. These would be just as\nefficacious as the drugs used under mysterious names, and concocted\nby human science. And they would leave no injurious effects in the\nsystem.\nThousands who are afflicted might recover their health if, instead\nof depending upon the drugstore for their life, they would discard all\ndrugs, and live simply, without using tea, coffee, liquor, or spices,\nwhich irritate the stomach and leave it weak, unable to digest even\nsimple food without stimulation. The Lord is willing to let His light\nshine forth in clear, distinct rays to all who are weak and feeble.\u2014\nManuscript 115, 1903 (General Manuscript regarding sanitarium\nwork).\nChapter 30\u2014Ellen G. White\u2019s Use of Remedial[292]\nAgencies\n[Ellen G. White speaks repeatedly of simple remedies. She\ntells us specifically what she means when she thus speaks, naming\npure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet, the\nuse of water, and trust in divine power. See pages 287-291 and The\nMinistry of Healing, 127. In addition to these, Mrs. White on a\nfew occasions, in her personal correspondence, made reference to\ncertain simple medications she knew and used; any such remedy\nwas usually mentioned in a single instance only. She also refers in\nher correspondence to a few rare emergency situations that led her\nto employ remedies she would not use except in a crisis.\nIn evaluating these references to certain medications, four points\nshould be observed by the reader:\n1. The following pages list the significant statements in which\nMrs. White mentions specific medications of a simple character,\ninsofar as such statements were known at the time this compilation\nwas made.\n2. A very few pages are required to place these statements in\nprint, some eleven pages as compared with the more than 2,000\npages devoted to the comprehensive presentation of the health coun-\nsels as found in the E.G. White books.\n3. For fifty years Mrs. White wrote extensively, for publication,\non the subject of health and the care of the sick. But it is an inter-\nesting and significant fact that, except for the brief mention of the\n\u201clump of figs\u201d for Hezekiah\u2019s boils, and a fleeting allusion to the\nineffectual use of \u201csimple herbs\u201d in the illness of one of her sons\n(see Spiritual Gifts, Volume II, p. 104), she made no reference to[293]\nthe medicinal use of herbs or to other specific simple medications in\nany of her published statements. To say the least, this fact does not\npermit the conclusion that the use of herbs is of prime importance in\nthe whole health program that she set forth in such completeness.\n278\nEllen G. White\u2019s Use of Remedial Agencies 279\n4. Mrs. White nowhere states, in discussing such simple medi-\ncations, that other and more effective medications might not later be\nfound.\nOwing to impressions held by some that Mrs. White\u2019s writings\nnot only endorse herbs but feature them as the principal means\nfor dealing with disease, and that there is a great abundance of\nunpublished material on this point, the White trustees believe that\nthe minds of Seventh-day Adventists will be helped and the record\nbest be kept clear by printing the statements that follow. In all\nfairness, the reader should not attach to these statements greater\nsignificance than did the author, who, in her published works, placed\nbefore the general public the broad principles to be followed in the\ntreatment of the sick.\u2014Compilers.]\nI Cannot Testify in Their Favor\nAfter seeing so much harm done by the administering of drugs,\nI cannot use them, and cannot testify in their favor. I must be true to\nthe light given me by the Lord.\nThe treatment we gave when the sanitarium was first established\nrequired earnest labor to combat disease. We did not use drug con-\ncoctions; we followed hygienic methods. This work was blessed\nby God. It was a work in which the human instrumentality could\ncooperate with God in saving life. There should be nothing put into\nthe human system that would leave its baleful influence behind. And\nto carry out the light on this subject, to practice hygienic treatment,\nand to educate on altogether different lines of treating the sick, was\nthe reason given me why we should have sanitariums established in\nvarious localities.\nI have been pained when many students have been encouraged\nto go to_____ [A state-operated medical college, to which a number\nof our early medical workers were sent to complete their training.\u2014\nCompilers.] to receive an education in the use of drugs. The light\nwhich I have received has placed an altogether different complexion\non the use made of drugs than is given at_____ or at the sanitarium. [294]\nWe must become enlightened on these subjects. The intricate names\ngiven the medicines are used to cover up the matter, so that none will\n280 Selected Messages Book 2\nknow what is given them as remedies unless they obtain a dictionary\nto find out the meaning of these names.\nThe Lord has given some simple herbs of the field that at times\nare beneficial; and if every family were educated in how to use these\nherbs in case of sickness, much suffering might be prevented, and\nno doctor need be called. These old-fashioned, simple herbs, used\nintelligently, would have recovered many sick who have died under\ndrug medication.\nOne of the most beneficial remedies is pulverized charcoal,\nplaced in a bag and used in fomentations. This is a most successful\nremedy. If wet in smartweed boiled, it is still better. I have ordered\nthis in cases where the sick were suffering great pain, and when it has\nbeen confided to me by the physician that he thought it was the last\nbefore the close of life. Then I suggested the charcoal, [It is of inter-\nest to observe in connection with the several E. G. White statements\nconcerning the value of charcoal, that as well as being a product\nof frequent medical prescription, a 1,160-page professional work,\nClinical Toxicology Of Commercial Products(Williams and Wilkins,\n1957, $16.00) advises as an antidote for many known poisons and\nfor all poisonous substances of unknown ingredients a \u201cUniversal\nAntidote\u201d of four parts, two of which are activated charcoal.\u2014Com-\npilers.] And the patient slept, the turning point came, and recovery\nwas the result. To students when injured with bruised hands and\nsuffering with inflammation, I have prescribed this simple remedy,\nwith perfect success. The poison of inflammation was overcome,\nthe pain removed, and healing went on rapidly. The most severe\ninflammation of the eyes will be relieved by a poultice of charcoal,\nput in a bag, and dipped in hot or cold water, as will best suit the\ncase. This works like a charm.\nI expect you will laugh at this; but if I could give this remedy\nsome outlandish name that no one knew but myself, it would have\ngreater influence....But the simplest remedies may assist nature, and\nleave no baleful effects after their use.\u2014Letter 82, 1897 (To Dr. J.\nH. Kellogg).\nEllen G. White\u2019s Use of Remedial Agencies 281\nWhen Asked for Counsel, Simple Remedies Advised [295]\nThere are many simple herbs which, if our nurses would learn the\nvalue of, they could use in the place of drugs, and find very effective.\nMany times I have been applied to for advice as to what should be\ndone in cases of sickness or accident, and I have mentioned some of\nthese simple remedies, and they have proved helpful.\nOn one occasion a physician came to me in great distress. He\nhad been called to attend a young woman who was dangerously ill.\nShe had contracted fever while on the campground, and was taken\nto our school building near Melbourne, Australia. But she became\nso much worse that it was feared she could not live. The physician,\nDr. Merritt Kellogg, came to me and said, \u201cSister White, have you\nany light for me on this case? If relief cannot be given our sister, she\ncan live but a few hours.\u201d I replied, \u201cSend to a blacksmith\u2019s shop,\nand get some pulverized charcoal; make a poultice of it, and lay it\nover her stomach and sides.\u201d The doctor hastened away to follow\nout my instructions. Soon he returned, saying, \u201cRelief came in less\nthan half an hour after the application of the poultices. She is now\nhaving the first natural sleep she has had for days.\u201d\nI have ordered the same treatment for others who were suffering\ngreat pain, and it has brought relief and been the means of saving\nlife. My mother had told me that snake bites and the sting of reptiles\nand poisonous insects could often be rendered harmless by the use\nof charcoal poultices. When working on the land at Avondale,\nAustralia, the workmen would often bruise their hands and limbs,\nand this in many cases resulted in such severe inflammation that the\nworker would have to leave his work for some time. One came to\nme one day in this condition, with his hand tied in a sling. He was\nmuch troubled over the circumstance; for his help was needed in\nclearing the land I said to him, \u201cGo to the place where you have been\nburning the timber, and get me some charcoal from the eucalyptus\ntree, pulverize it, and I will dress your hand.\u201d This was done, and [296]\nthe next morning he reported that the pain was gone. Soon he was\nready to return to his work.\nI write these things that you may know that the Lord has not\nleft us without the use of simple remedies which, when used, will\nnot leave the system in the weakened condition in which the use\n282 Selected Messages Book 2\nof drugs so often leaves it. We need well-trained nurses who can\nunderstand how to use the simple remedies that nature provides for\nrestoration to health, and who can teach those who are ignorant of\nthe laws of health how to use these simple but effective cures.\nHe who created men and women has an interest in those who\nsuffer. He has directed in the establishment of our sanitariums and\nin the building up of schools close to our sanitariums, that they may\nbecome efficient mediums in training men and women for the work\nof ministering to suffering humanity. In the treatment of the sick,\npoisonous drugs need not be used. Alcohol or tobacco in any form\nmust not be recommended, lest some soul be led to imbibe a taste\nfor these evil things.\u2014Letter 90, 1908 (To J. A. Burden and others\nbearing responsibility at Loma Linda).\nSafe, Simple Remedies\nIn regard to that which we can do for ourselves, there is a point\nthat requires careful, thoughtful consideration. I must become ac-\nquainted with myself, I must be a learner always as to how to take\ncare of this building, the body God has given me, that I may preserve\nit in the very best condition of health. I must eat those things which\nwill be for my very best good physically, and I must take special care\nto have my clothing such as will conduce to a healthful circulation\nof the blood. I must not deprive myself of exercise and air. I must\nget all the sunlight that it is possible for me to obtain.\nI must have wisdom to be a faithful guardian of my body. I should\ndo a very unwise thing to enter a cool room when in a perspiration;\nI should show myself an unwise steward to allow myself to sit in a\ndraft, and thus expose myself so as to take cold. I should be unwise\nto sit with cold feet and limbs, and thus drive back the blood from the[297]\nextremities to the brain or internal organs. I should always protect\nmy feet in damp weather.\nI should eat regularly of the most healthful food which will make\nthe best quality of blood, and I should not work intemperately if it is\nin my power to avoid doing so.\nAnd when I violate the laws God has established in my being,\nI am to repent and reform, and place myself in the most favorable\nEllen G. White\u2019s Use of Remedial Agencies 283\ncondition under the doctors God has provided\u2014pure air, pure water,\nand the healing, precious sunlight.\nWater can be used in many ways to relieve suffering. Drafts of\nclear, hot water taken before eating (half a quart, more or less), will\nnever do any harm, but will rather be productive of good.\nA cup of tea made from catnip herb will quiet the nerves.\nHop tea will induce sleep. Hop poultices over the stomach will\nrelieve pain.\nIf the eyes are weak, if there is pain in the eyes, or inflammation,\nsoft flannel cloths wet in hot water and salt, will bring relief quickly.\nWhen the head is congested, if the feet and limbs are put in a\nbath with a little mustard, relief will be obtained.\nThere are many more simple remedies which will do much to\nrestore healthful action to the body. All these simple preparations\nthe Lord expects us to use for ourselves, but man\u2019s extremities are\nGod\u2019s opportunities. If we neglect to do that which is within the\nreach of nearly every family, and ask the Lord to relieve pain when\nwe are too indolent to make use of these remedies within our power,\nit is simply presumption. The Lord expects us to work in order\nthat we may obtain food. He does not propose that we shall gather\nthe harvest unless we break the sod, till the soil, and cultivate the\nproduce. Then God sends the rain and the sunshine and the clouds\nto cause vegetation to flourish. God works and man cooperates with\nGod. Then there is seedtime and harvest.\nGod has caused to grow out of the ground, herbs for the use\nof man, and if we understand the nature of those roots and herbs,\nand make a right use of them, there would not be a necessity of [298]\nrunning for the doctor so frequently, and people would be in much\nbetter health than they are today. I believe in calling upon the Great\nPhysician when we have used the remedies I have mentioned.\u2014\nLetter 35, 1890 (To a worker in an overseas field).\nCounsel to the Medical Director of a New Sanitarium\nDo all that you possibly can to perfect the institution inside and\nout. Be sure that your premises are in the best of order. Let there be\nnothing about them that will make a disagreeable impression of the\nminds of the patients.\n284 Selected Messages Book 2\nEncourage the patients to live healthfully and to take an abun-\ndance of exercise. This will do much to restore them to health. Let\nseats be placed under the shade of the trees, that the patients may be\nencouraged to spend much time out-of-doors. And a place should be\nprovided, enclosed either with canvas or with glass, where, in cooler\nweather, the patients can sit in the sun without feeling the wind\nFresh air and sunshine, cheerfulness within and without the in-\nstitution, pleasant words and kindly acts\u2014these are the remedies\nthat the sick need, and God will crown with success your efforts to\nprovide these remedies for the sick ones who come to the sanitarium.\nBy happiness and cheerfulness and expressions of sympathy and\nhopefulness for others, your own soul will be filled with light and\npeace. And never forget that the sunshine of God\u2019s blessing is worth\neverything to us.\nTeach nurses and patients the value of those health-restoring\nagencies that are freely provided by God, and the usefulness of\nsimple things that are easily obtained.\nI will tell you a little about my experience with charcoal as a\nremedy. For some forms of indigestion, it is more efficacious than\ndrugs. A little olive oil into which some of this powder has been\nstirred tends to cleanse and heal. I find it is excellent. Pulverized\ncharcoal from eucalyptus wood we have used freely in cases of\ninflammation....\nAlways study and teach the use of the simplest remedies, and\nthe special blessing of the Lord may be expected to follow the use[299]\nof these means which are within the reach of the common people.\u2014\nLetter 100, 1903.\nOther Experiences With Charcoal\nA Rapid Recovery\u2014A brother was taken sick with inflamma-\ntion of the bowels and bloody dysentery. The man was not a careful\nhealth reformer, but indulged his appetite. We were just preparing to\nleave Texas, where we had been laboring for several months, and we\nhad carriages prepared to take away this brother and his family, and\nseveral others who were suffering from malarial fever. My husband\nand I thought we would stand this expense rather than have the heads\nEllen G. White\u2019s Use of Remedial Agencies 285\nof several families die and leave their wives and children unprovided\nfor.\nTwo or three were taken in a large spring wagon on spring\nmattresses. But this man who was suffering from inflammation\nof the bowels, sent for me to come to him. My husband and I\ndecided that it would not do to move him. Fears were entertained\nthat mortification had set in. Then the thought came to me like\na communication from the Lord to take pulverized charcoal, put\nwater upon it, and give this water to the sick man to drink, putting\nbandages of the charcoal over the bowels and stomach. We were\nabout one mile from the city of Denison, but the sick man\u2019s son went\nto a blacksmith\u2019s shop, secured the charcoal, and pulverized it, and\nthen used it according to the directions given. The result was that\nin half an hour there was a change for the better. We had to go on\nour journey and leave the family behind, but what was our surprise\nthe following day to see their wagon overtake us. The sick man\nwas lying in a bed in the wagon. The blessing of God had worked\nwith the simple means used.\u2014Letter 182, 1899 (To a worker in an\noverseas field. See p. 287).\nCharcoal and Flaxseed \u2014We need a hospital so much. On\nThursday Sister Sara McEnterfer [A trained nurse of experience well\nqualified for this type of service who accompanied Mrs. White and\nassisted her both as a traveling companion and private secretary.\u2014\nCompilers.] was called to see if she could do anything for brother B\u2019s\nlittle son, who is eighteen months old. For several days he has had a [300]\npainful swelling on the knee, supposed to be from the bite of some\npoisonous insect. Pulverized charcoal, mixed with flaxseed, was\nplaced upon the swelling, and this poultice gave relief at once. The\nchild had screamed with pain all night, but when this was applied,\nhe slept. Today she has been to see the little one twice. She opened\nthe swelling in two places, and a large amount of yellow matter\nand blood was discharged freely. The child was relieved of its great\nsuffering. We thank the Lord that we may become intelligent in using\nthe simple things within our reach to alleviate pain, and successfully\nremove its cause.\u2014Manuscript 68, 1899 (General Manuscript).\n286 Selected Messages Book 2\nOther Remedies Mentioned\nA Poultice of Figs for Hezekiah \u2014When Hezekiah was sick,\nthe prophet of God brought him the message that he should die.\nThe king cried to the Lord, and the Lord heard him, and sent the\npromise that fifteen years should be added to his life. One word from\nGod, one touch of the divine finger, would have been enough to cure\nHezekiah instantly. But instead, he was given directions to make a\npoultice of figs, and lay it upon the part affected. This was done,\nand Hezekiah was restored to health. It would be well to treasure\nthis prescription which the Lord ordered to be used, more than we\ndo.\u2014Manuscript 29, 1911 (General Manuscript).\nThe Value of Eucalyptus Oil \u2014I am very sorry to learn that\nSister C is not well. I cannot advise any remedy for her cough better\nthan eucalyptus and honey. Into a tumbler of honey put a few drops\nof the eucalyptus, stir it up well, and take whenever the cough comes\non. I have had considerable trouble with my throat, but whenever\nI use this I overcome the difficulty very quickly. I have to use it\nonly a few times, and the cough is removed. If you will use this\nprescription, you may be your own physician. If the first trial does\nnot effect a cure, try it again. The best time to take it is before\nretiring.\u2014Letter 348, 1908 (To a worker).\nI have already told you the remedy I use when suffering from[301]\ndifficulties with my throat. I take a glass of boiled honey, and into\nthis I put a few drops of eucalyptus oil, stirring it in well. When\nthe cough comes on, I take a teaspoonful of this mixture, and relief\ncomes almost immediately. I have always used this with the best of\nresults. I ask you to use the same remedy when you are troubled\nwith the cough. This prescription may seem so simple that you feel\nno confidence in it, but I have tried it for a number of years and can\nhighly recommend it.\nAgain, take warm footbaths into which have been put the leaves\nfrom the eucalyptus tree. There is great virtue in these leaves, and if\nyou will try this, you will prove my words to be true. The oil of the\neucalyptus is especially beneficial in cases of cough and pains in the\nchest and lungs. I want you to make a trial of this remedy which is\nso simple, and which costs you nothing.\u2014Letter 20, 1909 (To the\nworker addressed in the preceding item).\nEllen G.

Light was given that there is\nhealth in the fragrance of the pine, the cedar, and the fir. And there\nare several other kinds of trees that have medicinal properties that\nare health promoting.

We had just buried our oldest son\nwith this disease, and were very anxious in regard to Willie, fearing\nthat he, too, might die. We decided that we would not send for a\nphysician, but do the best we could with him ourselves by the use\nof water, and entreat the Lord in behalf of the child. We called in a\nfew who had faith to unite their prayers with ours. We had a sweet\nassurance of God\u2019s presence and blessing.\nThe next day Willie was very sick. He was wandering. He did\nnot seem to see or hear me when I spoke to him. His heart had no\nregular beat, but was in a constant agitated flutter. We continued to\nlook to God in his behalf, and to use water freely upon his head, and\na compress constantly upon his lungs, and soon he seemed rational\nas ever. He suffered severe pain in his right side, and could not\nlie upon it for a moment. This pain we subdued with cold water\ncompresses, varying the temperature of the water according to the\ndegree of the fever. We were very careful to keep his hands and feet\nwarm.\nWe expected the crisis would come the seventh day. We had\nbut little rest during his sickness, and were obliged to give him up[305]\ninto others\u2019 care the fourth and fifth nights. My husband and myself\nthe fifth day felt very anxious. The child raised fresh blood, and\ncoughed considerably. My husband spent much time in prayer. We\nleft our child in careful hands that night. Before retiring my husband\nprayed long and earnestly. Suddenly his burden of prayer left him,\nand it seemed as though a voice spoke to him, and said, \u201cGo lie\ndown, I will take care of the child.\u201d\nI had retired sick, and could not sleep for anxiety for several\nhours. I felt pressed for breath. Although sleeping in a large chamber,\nI arose and opened the door into a large hall, and was at once relieved,\n290\nPersonal Experiences 291\nand soon slept. I dreamed that an experienced physician was standing\nby my child, watching every breath, with one hand over his heart,\nand with the other feeling his pulse. He turned to us and said,\n\u201cThe crisis has passed. He has seen his worst night. He will now\ncome up speedily, for he has not the injurious influence of drugs to\nrecover from. Nature has nobly done her work to rid the system of\nimpurities.\u201d I related to him my worn-out condition, my pressure for\nbreath, and the relief obtained by opening the door.\nSaid he, \u201cThat which gave you relief, will also relieve your child.\nHe needs air. You have kept him too warm. The heated air coming\nfrom a stove is injurious, and were it not for the air coming in at the\ncrevices of the windows, would be poisonous and destroy life. Stove\nheat destroys the vitality of the air, and weakens the lungs. The\nchild\u2019s lungs have been weakened by the room being kept too warm.\nSick persons are debilitated by disease, and need all the invigorating\nair that they can bear to strengthen the vital organs to resist disease.\nAnd yet in most cases air and light are excluded from the sickroom\nat the very time when most needed, as though dangerous enemies.\u201d\nThis dream and my husband\u2019s experience was a consolation to\nus both. We found in the morning that our boy had passed a restless\nnight. He seemed to be in a high fever until noon. Then the fever\nleft him, and he appeared quite well, except weak. He had eaten\nbut one small cracker through his five-days\u2019 sickness. He came\nup rapidly, and has had better health than he has had for several [306]\nyears before. This experience is valuable to us.\u2014Spiritual Gifts\n4a:151-153, (1864), (first section).\nThe Restoration of James White\n[Statement made April 13, 1902, at a council meeting at Elmshaven,\nSt. Helena, California.]\nMany years ago [1865], while my husband was bearing heavy\nresponsibilities in Battle Creek, the strain began to tell on him. His\nhealth failed rapidly. Finally he broke down in mind and body, and\nwas unable to do anything. My friends said to me, \u201cMrs. White,\nyour husband cannot live.\u201d I determined to remove him to a place\n292 Selected Messages Book 2\nmore favorable for his recovery. His mother said, \u201cEllen, you must\nremain and take care of your family.\u201d\n\u201cMother,\u201d I replied, \u201cI will never allow that masterly brain to fail\nentirely. I will work with God, and God will work with me, to save\nmy husband\u2019s brain.\u201d\nIn order to obtain means for our journey, I pulled up my rag\ncarpets and sold them With the money secured by the sale of the\ncarpets, I bought a covered wagon, and prepared for the journey,\nplacing in the wagon a mattress for Father to lie on. Accompanied\nby Willie, a mere lad eleven years of age, we started for Wright,\nMichigan.\nWhile on the journey, Willie tried to put the bits into the mouth of\none of the horses, but found that he could not. I said to my husband,\n\u201cPut your hand on my shoulder, and come and put the bits in.\u201d\nHe said that he did not see how he could. \u201cYes, you can,\u201d I\nreplied. \u201cGet right up and come.\u201d He did so, and succeeded in\nputting the bits in. Then he knew that he would have to do it the\nnext time, too.\nConstantly I kept my husband working at such little things. I\nwould not allow him to remain quiet, but tried to keep him active.\nThis is the plan that physicians and helpers in our sanitariums should\npursue. Lead the patients along step by step, step by step, keeping\ntheir minds so busily occupied that they have no time to brood over\ntheir own condition.\nPhysical and Mental Activity Encouraged[307]\nOften brethren came to us for counsel. My husband wanted\nto see no one. He much preferred to go into another room when\ncompany came. But usually before he could realize that anyone had\ncome, I brought the visitor before him, and would say, \u201cHusband,\nhere is a brother who has come to ask a question, and as you can\nanswer it much better than I can, I have brought him to you.\u201d Of\ncourse he could not help himself then. He had to remain in the room\nand answer the question. In this way, and in many other ways, I\nmade him exercise his mind. If he had not been made to use his\nmind, in a little while it would have completely failed.\nPersonal Experiences 293\nDaily my husband went out for a walk. In the winter a terrible\nsnowstorm came, and Father thought he could not go out in the storm\nand snow. I went to Brother Root and said, \u201cBrother Root, have you\na spare pair of boots?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he answered.\n\u201cI should be glad to borrow them this morning,\u201d I said. Putting\non the boots and starting out, I tracked a quarter of a mile in the deep\nsnow. On my return, I asked my husband to take a walk. He said\nhe could not go out in such weather. \u201cOh, yes, you can,\u201d I replied.\n\u201cSurely you can step in my tracks.\u201d He was a man who had great\nrespect for women; and when he saw my tracks, he thought that if a\nwoman could walk in that snow, he could. That morning he took his\nusual walk.\nIn the spring there were fruit trees to be set out and garden to be\nmade. \u201cWillie,\u201d I said, \u201cplease buy three hoes and three rakes. Be\nsure to buy three of each.\u201d When he brought them to me, I told him\nto take one of the hoes, and Father another. Father objected, but took\none. Taking one myself, we began work; and although I blistered\nmy hands, I led them in the hoeing. Father could not do much, but\nhe went through the motions. It was by such methods as these, that I\ntried to cooperate with God in restoring my husband to health. And\noh, how the Lord blessed us!\nI always took my husband with me when I went out driving. [308]\nAnd I took him with me when I went to preach at any place. I had\na regular circuit of meetings. I could not persuade him to go into\nthe desk while I preached. Finally, after many, many months, I\nsaid to him, \u201cNow, my husband, you are going into the desk today.\u201d\nHe did not want to go, but I would not yield. I took him up into\nthe desk with me. That day he spoke to the people. Although the\nmeetinghouse was filled with unbelievers, for half an hour I could\nnot refrain from weeping. My heart was overflowing with joy and\ngratitude. I knew that the victory had been gained.\nRewarded for Persistent Effort\nAfter eighteen months of constant cooperation with God in the\neffort to restore my husband to health, I took him home again.\n294 Selected Messages Book 2\nPresenting him to his parents, I said, \u201cFather, Mother, here is your\nson.\u201d\n\u201cEllen,\u201d said his mother, \u201cyou have no one but God and your-\nself to thank for this wonderful restoration. Your energies have\naccomplished it.\u201d\nAfter his recovery, my husband lived for a number of years, dur-\ning which time he did the best work of his life. Did not those added\nyears of usefulness repay me manyfold for the eighteen months of\npainstaking care?\nI have given you this brief recital of personal experience, in\norder to show you that I know something about the use of natural\nmeans for the restoration of the sick. God will work wonders for\nevery one of us if we work in faith, acting as we believe, that when\nwe cooperate with Him, He is ready to do His part. I desire to do\neverything I can to lead my brethren to pursue a sensible course,\nin order that their efforts may be the most successful. Many who\nhave gone down into the grave might today be living, if they had\ncooperated with God. Let us be sensible men and women in regard\nto these matters.\u2014Manuscript 50, 1902.\nSection 8\u2014General Counsels [309]\n[310]\nIntroduction\nThe Spirit of Prophecy counsels are always practical. From the\npen of Ellen White we find counsel and instruction touching almost\nevery phase of Christian life and experience. Although most of the\nlines of instruction given are represented in theTestimoniesand other\nEllen G. White books, the reindexing of published but now out-of-\nprint materials and of unpublished manuscripts has revealed items\nof counsel along certain lines, which are becoming of increasing\nimportance today with the appearance of new and difficult situations.\nThese items will add tangibly to the wealth of instruction now in the\nhands of Seventh-day Adventists.\nAs an instance, we offer the formerly unpublished statements on\nthe problem of hypnosis, which in some medical circles is looked\nupon favorably as a means of therapy. The specific Ellen G. White\ncounsels dealing with the use of hypnosis in the treatment of the sick,\nand indicating the hazards of using it in any way, are very pertinent\nat this time.\nThe section closes with counsels calling upon Seventh-day Ad-\nventists to consider the value of a rural environment for their homes.\nThese are drawn from sources other than the published books, but\nhave been presented earlier in the pamphlet Country Living, with\nemphasis on the importance of moving carefully and guardedly in\nchoosing a new location for the home in the country and away from\nthe crowded cities. Appearing here in this permanent form, they are\navailable for ready reference.\nWhite Trustees.\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Methods, No. 7.]\n296\nChapter 32\u2014Proper Attitude in Prayer [311]\nI have received letters questioning me in regard to the proper\nattitude to be taken by a person offering prayer to the Sovereign of\nthe universe. Where have our brethren obtained the idea that they\nshould stand upon their feet when praying to God? One who has\nbeen educated for about five years in Battle Creek was asked to lead\nin prayer before Sister White should speak to the people. But as I\nbeheld him standing upright upon his feet while his lips were about\nto open in prayer to God, my soul was stirred within me to give him\nan open rebuke. Calling him by name, I said, \u201cGet down upon your\nknees.\u201d This is the proper position always.\n\u201cAnd He was withdrawn from them about a stone\u2019s cast, and\nkneeled down, and prayed\u201d (Luke 22:41).\n\u201cPeter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and\nturning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her\neyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up\u201d (Acts 9:40).\n\u201cThey stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus,\nreceive my spirit. And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice,\nLord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he [312]\nfell asleep\u201d (Acts 7:59, 60).\n\u201cWhen he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with\nthem all\u201d (Acts 20:36).\n\u201cWhen we had accomplished those days, we departed and went\nour way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,\ntill we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and\nprayed\u201d (Acts 21:5).\n\u201cAt the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and\nhaving rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and\nspread out my hands unto the Lord my God, and said, O my God, I\nam ashamed and blush to lift up my face to Thee, my God: for our\niniquities are increased over our head, and our trespass is grown up\nunto the heavens\u201d (Ezra 9:5, 6).\n297\n298 Selected Messages Book 2\n\u201cO come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the\nLord our Maker\u201d (Psalm 95:6).\n\u201cFor this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist\u201d (Ephesians 3:14). And this whole chapter will, if the heart is\nreceptive, be as precious a lesson as we can learn.\nTo bow down when in prayer to God is the proper attitude to\noccupy. This act of worship was required of the three Hebrew\ncaptives in Babylon.... But such an act was homage to be rendered\nto God alone\u2014the Sovereign of the world, the Ruler of the universe;\nand these three Hebrews refused to give such honor to any idol even\nthough composed of pure gold. In doing so, they would, to all intents\nand purposes, be bowing to the king of Babylon. Refusing to do as\nthe king had commanded, they suffered the penalty, and were cast\ninto the burning fiery furnace. But Christ came in person and walked\nwith them through the fire, and they received no harm.\nBoth in public and private worship it is our duty to bow down\nupon our knees before God when we offer our petitions to Him. This\nact shows our dependence upon God.\nAt the dedication of the Temple, Solomon stood facing the altar.\nIn the court of the Temple was a brazen scaffold or platform, and[313]\nafter ascending this, he stood and lifted up his hands to heaven, and\nblessed the immense congregation of Israel, and all the congregation\nof Israel stood....\n\u201cFor Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long,\nand five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the\nmidst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon\nhis knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his\nhands toward heaven\u201d (2 Chronicles 6:13).\nThe lengthy prayer which he then offered was appropriate for\nthe occasion. It was inspired of God, breathing the sentiments of the\nloftiest piety blended with the deepest humility.\nA Growing Laxness\nI present these proof texts with the inquiry, \u201cWhere did Brother\nH obtain his education?\u201d\u2014At Battle Creek. Is it possible that with\nall the light that God has given to His people on the subject of\nreverence, that ministers, principals, and teachers in our schools, by\nProper Attitude in Prayer 299\nprecept and example, teach young men to stand erect in devotion\nas did the Pharisees? Shall we look upon this as significant of their\nself-sufficiency and self-importance? Are these traits to become\nconspicuous?\n\u201cAnd he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in them-\nselves that they were righteous, and despised others: Two men went\nup into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publi-\ncan. The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank\nthee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,\nor even as this publican. I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all\nthat I possess\u201d (Luke 18:9-12). Mark you, it was the self-righteous\nPharisee who was not in a position of humility and reverence before\nGod; but standing in his haughty self-sufficiency, he told the Lord all\nhis good deeds. \u201cThe Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself\u201d\n(Luke 18:11); and his prayer reached no higher than himself.\n\u201cAnd the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\nas his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be [314]\nmerciful to me a sinner. I tell you, this man went down to his house\njustified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself\nshall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted\u201d (Luke\n18:13, 14).\nWe hope that our brethren will not manifest less reverence and\nawe as they approach the only true and living God than the heathen\nmanifest for their idol deities, or these people will be our judges in\nthe day of final decision. I would speak to all who occupy the place\nof teachers in our schools. Men and women, do not dishonor God by\nyour irreverence and pomposity. Do not stand up in your Pharisaism\nand offer your prayers to God. Mistrust your own strength. Depend\nnot in it; but often bow down on your knees before God, and worship\nHim.\nOn Bended Knee\nAnd when you assemble to worship God, be sure and bow your\nknees before Him. Let this act testify that the whole soul, body, and\nspirit are in subjection to the Spirit of truth. Who have searched the\nWord closely for examples and direction in this respect? Whom can\nwe trust as teachers in our schools in America and foreign countries?\n300 Selected Messages Book 2\nAfter years of study shall students return to their own country with\nperverted ideas of the respect and honor and reverence that should\nbe given to God, and feel under no obligation to honor the men of\ngray hairs, the men of experience, the chosen servants of God who\nhave been connected with the work of God through almost all the\nyears of their life? I advise all who attend the schools in America or\nin any other place, do not catch the spirit of irreverence. Be sure you\nunderstand for yourself what kind of education you need, that you\nmay educate others to obtain a fitness of character that will stand the\ntest that is soon to be brought upon all who live upon the earth. Keep\ncompany with the soundest Christians. Choose not the pretentious\ninstructors or pupils, but those who show the deepest piety, those\nwho have a spirit of intelligence in the things of God.\nWe are living in perilous times. Seventh-day Adventists are\nprofessedly the commandment-keeping people of God; but they[315]\nare losing their devotional spirit. This spirit of reverence for God\nteaches men how to approach their Maker\u2014with sacredness and awe\nthrough faith, not in themselves, but in a Mediator. Thus man is kept\nfast, under whatever circumstances he is placed. Man must come\non bended knee, as a subject of grace, a suppliant at the footstool of\nmercy. And as he receives daily mercies at the hand of God, he is\never to cherish gratitude in his heart, and give expression to it in the\nwords of thanksgiving and praise for these unmerited favors. Angels\nhave been guarding his pathway through all his life, and many of\nthe snares he has been delivered from he has not seen. And for this\nguardianship and watchcare by eyes that never slumber and never\nsleep, he is to recognize in every prayer the service of God for him.\nAll should lean upon God in their helplessness and daily neces-\nsity. They should keep humble, watchful, and prayerful. Praise and\nthanksgiving should flow forth in gratitude and sincere love for God.\nIn the assembly of the upright and in the congregation should\nthey praise the Most High God. All who have a sense of their vital\nconnection with God should stand before the Lord as witnesses for\nHim, giving expression of the love, the mercies, and the goodness\nof God. Let the words be sincere, simple, earnest, intelligent, the\nheart burning with the love of God, the lips sanctified to His glory\nnot only to make known the mercies of God in the assembly of the\nProper Attitude in Prayer 301\nsaints but to be His witnesses in every place. The inhabitants of the\nearth are to know that He is God, the only true and living God.\nThere should be an intelligent knowledge of how to come to\nGod in reverence and Godly fear with devotional love. There is a\ngrowing lack of reverence for our Maker, a growing disregard of His\ngreatness and His majesty. But God is speaking to us in these last\ndays. We hear His voice in the storm, in the rolling thunder. We\nhear of the calamities He permits in the earthquakes, the breaking\nforth of waters, and the destructive elements sweeping all before\nthem. We hear of ships going down in the tempestuous ocean. God [316]\nspeaks to families who have refused to recognize Him, sometimes\nin the whirlwind and storm, sometimes face to face as He talked\nwith Moses. Again He whispers His love to the little trusting child\nand to the gray-haired sire in his dotage. And earthly wisdom has a\nwisdom as it beholds the unseen.\nWhen the still small voice which succeeds the whirlwind and the\ntempest that moves the rocks out of position, is heard, let all cover\ntheir face, for God is very near. Let them hide themselves in Jesus\nChrist; for He is their hiding place. The cleft in the rock is hidden\nwith His own pierced hand while the humble seeker waits in bowed\nattitude to hear what saith the Lord unto His servant.\u2014Manuscript\n84b, 1897.\nNo Place Inappropriate for Prayer\nThere is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to offer up\na petition to God.. . . In the crowds of the street, in the midst of a\nbusiness engagement, we may send up a petition to God, and plead\nfor divine guidance, as did Nehemiah when he made his request\nbefore King Artaxerxes\u2014Steps to Christ, 99, (Pocket ed.).\nWe may speak with Jesus as we walk by the way, and He says,\nI am at thy right hand. We may commune with God in our hearts;\nwe may walk in companionship with Christ. When engaged in our\ndaily labor, we may breathe out our heart\u2019s desire, inaudible to any\nhuman ear; but that word cannot die away into silence, nor can it be\nlost. Nothing can drown the soul\u2019s desire. It rises above the din of\nthe street, above the noise of machinery. It is God to whom we are\nspeaking, and our prayer is heard.\u2014Gospel Workers, 258.\n302 Selected Messages Book 2\nIt is not always necessary to bow upon your knees in order to\npray. Cultivate the habit of talking with the Saviour when you are\nalone, when you are walking, and when you are busy with your daily\nlabor.\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 510, 511.\nChapter 33\u2014\u201cNo Other Gods Before Me\u201d [317]\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 13.]\nEvery true child of God will be sifted as wheat, and in the sifting\nprocess every cherished pleasure which diverts the mind from God\nmust be sacrificed. In many families the mantel shelves, stands, and\ntables are filled with ornaments and pictures. Albums filled with\nphotographs of the family and their friends are placed where they\nwill attract the attention of visitors. Thus the thoughts, which should\nbe upon God and heavenly interests, are brought down to common\nthings. Is not this a species of idolatry? Should not the money thus\nspent have been used to bless humanity, to relieve the suffering, to\nclothe the naked, and to feed the hungry? Should it not be placed in\nthe Lord\u2019s treasury to advance His cause and build up His kingdom\nin the earth?\nThis matter is of great importance, and it is urged upon you to\nsave you from the sin of idolatry. Blessing would come to your\nsouls if you would obey the word spoken by the Holy One of Israel,\n\u201cThou shalt have no other Gods before me\u201d (Exodus 20:3). Many are\ncreating unnecessary cares and anxieties for themselves by devoting\ntime and thought to the unnecessary ornaments with which their\nhouses are filled. The power of God is needed to arouse them from [318]\nthis devotion; for to all intents and purposes it is idolatry.\nHe who searches the heart, desires to win His people from every\nspecies of idolatry. Let the Word of God, the blessed book of life,\noccupy the tables now filled with useless ornaments. Spend your\nmoney in buying books that will be the means of enlightening the\nmind in regard to present truth. The time you waste in moving\nand dusting the multitudinous ornaments in your house, spend in\nwriting a few lines to your friends, in sending papers or leaflets or\nlittle books to someone who knows not the truth. Grasp the Word\nof the Lord as the treasure of infinite wisdom and love; this is the\nGuidebook that points out the path to heaven. It points us to the\n303\n304 Selected Messages Book 2\nsin-pardoning Saviour, saying, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God, which\ntaketh away the sin of the world\u201d (John 1:29).\nO that you would search the Scriptures with prayerful hearts, and\na spirit of surrender to God!

Some had been\nbringing in false tests, and had made their own ideas and notions\na criterion, magnifying matters of little importance into tests of\nChristian fellowship, and binding heavy burdens upon others. Thus\na spirit of criticism, faultfinding, and dissension had come in, which\nhad been a great injury to the church. And the impression was given\nto unbelievers that Sabbathkeeping Adventists were a set of fanatics[319]\nand extremists, and that their peculiar faith rendered them unkind,\nuncourteous, and really unchristian in character. Thus the course of\na few extremists prevented the influence of the truth from reaching\nthe people.\nSome were making the matter of dress of first importance, crit-\nicizing articles of dress worn by others, and standing ready to\ncondemn everyone who did not exactly meet their ideas. A few\ncondemned pictures, urging that they are prohibited by the second\ncommandment, and that everything of this kind should be destroyed.\nThese one-idea men can see nothing except to press the one\nthing that presents itself to their minds. Years ago we had to meet\nthis same spirit and work. Men arose claiming to have been sent\nwith a message condemning pictures, and urging that every likeness\nof anything should be destroyed. They went to such lengths as even\nto condemn clocks which had figures, or \u201cpictures,\u201d upon them.\n\u201cNo Other Gods Before Me\u201d 305\nNow we read in the Bible of a good conscience; and there are\nnot only good but bad consciences. There is a conscientiousness\nthat will carry everything to extremes, and make Christian duties\nas burdensome as the Jews made the observance of the Sabbath.\nThe rebuke which Jesus gave to the scribes and Pharisees applies to\nthis class as well: \u201cYe tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs,\nand pass over judgment and the love of God\u201d (Luke 11:42). One\nfanatic, with his strong spirit and radical ideas, who will oppress the\nconscience of those who want to be right, will do great harm. The\nchurch needs to be purified from all such influences.\nPictures Used by God\nThe second commandment prohibits image worship; but God\nHimself employed pictures and symbols to represent to His prophets\nlessons which He would have them give to the people, and which\ncould thus be better understood than if given in any other way. He\nappealed to the understanding through the sense of sight. Prophetic\nhistory was presented to Daniel and John in symbols, and these\nwere to be represented plainly upon tables, that he who reads might [320]\nunderstand.\nIt is true that altogether too much money is expended upon\npictures; not a little means which should flow into the treasury\nof God is paid to the artist. But the evil that will result to the church\nfrom the course of these extremists is far greater than that which\nthey are trying to correct. It is sometimes a difficult matter to tell just\nwhere the line is, where picturemaking becomes a sin. But those who\nlove God and desire with all their hearts to keep His commandments,\nwill be directed by Him. God would not have them depend on\nany man to be conscience for them. He who accepts all the ideas\nand impressions of unbalanced minds will become confused and\nbewildered. It is Satan\u2019s object to divert the attention from the third\nangel\u2019s message to side issues, that minds and hearts that should be\ngrowing in grace and in the knowledge of the truth, may be dwarfed\nand enfeebled, so that God may not be glorified by them.\u2014Historical\nSketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists,\n211, 212.\nChapter 34\u2014Useful Occupation Better Than Games[321]\n[Portion of a letter addressed to a college student, written from\nNapier, New Zealand, October 2, 1893. Appeared in Notebook\nLeaflets, Education, No. 6]\nEducate men and women to bring up their children free from\nfalse, fashionable practices, to teach them to be useful. The daugh-\nters should be educated under the mothers to do useful labor, not\nmerely indoor labor but out-of-door labor as well. Mothers could\nalso train the sons, to a certain age, to do useful things indoors and\nout-of-doors.\nThere are plenty of necessary, useful things to do in our world\nthat would make the pleasure-amusement exercise almost wholly\nunnecessary. Brain, bone, and muscle will acquire solidity and\nstrength in using them to a purpose, doing good hard thinking, and\nin devising plans which shall train them [the youth] to develop\npowers of intellect and strength of the physical organs, which will\nbe putting into practical use their God-given talents with which they\nmay glorify God.\nThis was plainly laid out before our health institution and our\ncollege as the forcible reason why they should be established among\nus; but as it was in the days of Noah and Lot, so it is in our time.\nMen have sought out many inventions and have widely departed\nfrom God\u2019s purposes and His ways.\nThe Danger in Sports[322]\nI do not condemn the simple exercise of playing ball; but this,\neven in its simplicity, may be overdone. I shrink always from the\nalmost sure result which follows in the wake of these amusements.\nIt leads to an outlay of means that should be expended in bringing\nthe light of truth to souls that are perishing out of Christ. The\namusements and expenditures of means for self-pleasing, which lead\non step by step to self-glorifying, and the educating in these games\n306\nUseful Occupation Better Than Games 307\nfor pleasure, produce a love and passion for such things that is not\nfavorable to the perfection of Christian character.\nThe way that they have been conducted at the college does not\nbear the impress of heaven. It does not strengthen the intellect. It\ndoes not refine and purify the character. There are threads leading\nout through the habits and customs and worldly practices, and the\nactors become so engrossed and infatuated that they are pronounced\nin heaven, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God. In the place\nof the intellect becoming strengthened to do better work as students,\nto be better qualified as Christians to perform the Christian duties,\nthe exercise in these games is filling their brains with thoughts that\ndistract the mind from their studies.\nThe More Excellent Way\nNow the same power of exercise of mind and muscle might invent\nways and means of altogether a higher class of exercise, in doing\nmissionary work which would make them laborers together with\nGod, and would be educating for higher usefulness in the present life,\nin doing useful work, which is a most essential branch in education.\nThere are many ways in which the youth can be putting to usury\nthe talents entrusted to them of God, to build up the work and cause\nof God, not to please themselves but to glorify God. The Majesty of\nheaven, the King of glory, made the infinite sacrifice in coming to\nour world in order that He might elevate and ennoble humanity. He\nwas a persevering, diligent worker. We read, He \u201cwent about doing [323]\ngood\u201d (Acts 10:38).\nIs not this the work that every youth should be seeking to do,\nworking in Christ\u2019s lines? You have Christ\u2019s help. The ideas of the\nstudents will broaden. They will be far-reaching, and the powers of\nusefulness, even in your students\u2019 life, will be continually growing.\nThe arms, the hands, which God has given, are to be used in doing\ngood which shall bear the signet of heaven, that you can at last hear\nthe \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant\u201d (Matthew 25:21).\nI do not think, from the way the matter has been presented to\nme, that your ball games are so conducted that the record of the\nstudents will be of that character, in the estimation of Him who\nweighs actions, that will bring a reward to the actors.\n308 Selected Messages Book 2\nLet there be a company formed somewhat after the plan of the\nChristian Endeavor order, and see what can be done by each ac-\ncountable human agent, in watching and improving opportunities\nto do work for the Master. He has a vineyard in which everyone\ncan perform good work. Suffering humanity needs help everywhere.\nThe students may win their way to hearts by speaking words in\nseason, by doing favors for those who need even physical labor. This\nwill not degrade any one of you, and it will bring a consciousness of\nthe approval of God. It will be putting the talents, entrusted to you\nfor wise improvement, to the exchangers. It will increase them by\ntrading upon them.\nThere are healthful methods of exercise that may be planned\nwhich will be beneficial to both soul and body. There is a great\nwork to be done, and it is essential that every responsible agent shall\neducate himself to do this work acceptably to God. There is much\nfor all to learn, and there cannot be invented a better use for brain,\nbone, and muscle than to accept the wisdom of God in doing good,\nand adopting some human device for remedying the existing evils\nof this profligate, extravagant age.\nIt is our duty ever to seek to do good in the use of the muscles\nand brain God has given to youth, that they may be useful to others,[324]\nmaking their labors lighter, soothing the sorrowing, lifting up the\ndiscouraged, speaking words of comfort to the hopeless, turning\nthe minds of the students from fun and frolic which often carries\nthem beyond the dignity of manhood and womanhood to shame and\ndisgrace. The Lord would have the mind elevated, seeking higher,\nnobler channels of usefulness.\nThe Dangers to Spirituality\nIs the eye single to the glory of God in these games? I know\nthat this is not so. There is a losing sight of God\u2019s way and His\npurposes. The employment of intelligent beings, in probationary\ntime, is superseding God\u2019s revealed will, and substituting for it\nthe speculations and inventions of the human agent, with Satan by\nhis side to imbue with his spirit. Keep the Word of God close by\nyour side. Guided by it you will be wise, you will be steadfast,\nimmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. We must in\nUseful Occupation Better Than Games 309\nthese last days watch unto prayer. The Lord God of heaven protests\nagainst the burning passion cultivated for supremacy in the games\nthat are so engrossing.\nIn no time in your life have you been more critically placed\nthan you are while prosecuting your medical studies in Ann Arbor.\nSatan is watching every avenue whereby he can take advantage to\nenter with his specious temptations to spoil the soul. You will meet\nwith infidel sentiments in very intelligent men who call themselves\nChristians. Cling to the wisdom which is revealed to you in the\nWord of God, for it will bind you, if you obey its teachings, to the\nthrone of God.\nI am fearful now, more than at any other period of time, that\nChristians, as individuals, may separate from God because they lose\nsight of the Pattern, Jesus Christ, and think it is safe to walk in the\nsparks of their own kindling, deceiving the soul with thinking it is\nthe way of the Lord.\u2014Letter 17a, 1893.\nChapter 35\u2014Guidance by Chance Methods[325]\n[Counsel to a businessman concerning methods he employed in\nmaking important decisions.]\nYou endeavor to reach correct decisions regarding religious du-\nties, and to make decisions regarding business enterprises, by the\ntossing up of a coin, and letting the position in which it falls de-\ncide what course you shall pursue. I am instructed to say that we\nare not to give encouragement to any such methods. They are too\ncommon, too much like sleight-of-hand movements. They are not\nof the Lord, and those who depend upon them for direction will\nmeet with failure and disappointment. Being nothing more than a\nmatter of chance, the influence of adopting such tests regarding duty\nis calculated to lead the mind to depend on chance and guesswork,\nwhen all our work and plans for work should be established on the\nsure foundation of the Word of God.\nThe people of God can come to a correct understanding of their\nduty only through sincere prayer and earnest seeking for the sanc-\ntification of the Holy Spirit. When they seek aright for instruction\nconcerning their course of action, these strange and unreliable meth-\nods will not be accepted by them. They will then be saved from\nhaphazard work, and from the confusion that is ever the result of\ndepending on human devisings....\nTo our people I will say, Let none be led from the sound, sensible[326]\nprinciples that God has laid down for the guidance of His people, to\ndepend for direction on any such device as the tossing up of a coin.\nSuch a course is well pleasing to the enemy of souls; for he works\nto control the coin, and through its agency works out his plans. Let\nnone be so easily deceived as to place confidence in any such tests.\nLet none belittle their experience by resorting to cheap devices for\ndirection in important matters connected with the work of God.\nThe Lord works in no haphazard way. Seek Him most earnestly\nin prayer. He will impress the mind, and will give tongue and\n310\nGuidance by Chance Methods 311\nutterance. The people of God are to be educated not to trust in\nhuman inventions and uncertain tests as a means of learning God\u2019s\nwill concerning them. Satan and his agencies are always ready to\nstep into any opening to be found that will lead souls away from the\npure principles of the Word of God. The people who are led and\ntaught of God will give no place to devisings for which there is not\na \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d\nLet all who claim to be preparing for the coming of the Lord\nhumbly seek Him for a knowledge of His will, and for a spirit that\nis willing to walk in all the light He sends.

Let us go to the Word of God for instruction.\n\u201cSearch the scriptures,\u201d the Saviour said.... We need to humble our\nhearts and purify our souls daily, learning at all times to walk by the\nfaith of the Son of God.\nMy brethren and sisters, leave all minor tests that you may be\ntempted to make, and test your spirit by the witness of the Word of\nGod. Study that Word, that you may know the character and will of\nGod. It is positively essential that every believer make the truths of\nthe Bible his guide and safeguard. To every young man and woman,\nand to those of advanced years, I testify that the study of the Word\nis the only safeguard for the soul who would remain steadfast unto\nthe end.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series B 17a:25-29.\nQuestions Answered in an Interview [327]\nW.

He writes the words on either\nside of a card, and then drops it, and accepts as an answer the way\nin which the card falls, believing that in this way God indicates that\nHe does or does not want him to do a certain thing.\nE. G. White : [It is a haphazard method, which God does not\napprove. To men who have suggested such tests, I have said, \u201cNo,\nno.\u201d The sacred things which concern the cause of God must not be\ndealt with by such methods. God does not instruct us that we are to\nlearn His will in any such way.\n312 Selected Messages Book 2\nWill it furnish us with experiences that will glorify God, for us\nto decide what is His will by the dropping of a card or a coin, and\nobserving how it falls? No, no. Such tests as this will spoil the\nreligious experience of the one who adopts them. Everyone who\ndepends upon such things for guidance, needs to be reconverted.]\n[Inserted by Mrs. E. G. White when reading this report.]\nAfter the great disappointment of the Adventist people in 1844,\nwe had all these things to contend with over and over again. Then\nI was raised up from a bed of sickness, and sent to give a message\nof reproof for such fanaticism. They used different methods. They\nwould select a sign, and then follow the course indicated by the sign.\nIn one case they would not bury a child that had died, because\nthey understood from the sign that they had set, that the child was\ngoing to be raised from the dead.\nI was sent to bear my testimony regarding the fallacy of these\nthings that they were using as signs.

I see\na property that looks good to me, I ask the Lord to tell me whether\nto buy it or not. Then I adopt the manner of tossing up a piece of[328]\nmoney, and if it comes one side up, I buy it; and if the other side\ncomes up, I will not buy it.\nE. G. White: God has given me the message that no such thing\nis to come into the work of His cause. It would lower it into the\ndust. This is how it was presented to me. It would divert the mind\nfrom God and His power and His grace, to commonplace things,\nand the enemy would use these commonplace things so as to show\nsomething wonderful as the result of following these man-made\ntests....\nW. C. White: Sister Harris says that Brother Harris always prays\nbefore he tosses up his coin. Would not that make some difference?\nE. G. White : Not a whit of difference. Did not the fanatics of\nwhom I have spoken always pray when they were going through\nthose awful experiences in the State of Maine? This plan leads to\ntrusting in what the human can do.

But the marriage took place with your consent, and\nyour daughter, knowing all about him, accepted him as her husband,\nand now I can see no reason why you should carry any burden over\nthis matter. Your daughter loves J, and it may be that this marriage\nis in the order of God in order that both J and your daughter may\nhave a richer Christian experience, and be built up where they are\ndeficient. Your daughter has pledged herself to J in marriage, and to\nbreak her marriage vows would be far from right. She cannot now\ndisannul her obligations to him.... I had a personal knowledge of his\nformer relations with his first wife K. J loved K far too well; for she\nwas not worthy of his regard. He did all in his power to help her,\nand sought in every possible way to retain her as his wife. He could\nnot have done more than he did do. I pleaded with her, and tried\nto show her the inconsistency of her course, and begged her not to\nobtain a divorce; but she was determined and willful and stubborn,\nand would have her own way. While she lived with him, she sought\nto secure all the money possible from him, but she would not treat[340]\nhim kindly as a wife should treat her husband.\nJ did not put his wife away. She left him, and put him away,\nand married another man. I see nothing in the Scripture that forbids\nhim to marry again in the Lord. He has a right to the affection of a\nwoman....\nI cannot see that this new union should be disturbed. It is a\nserious matter to part a man and his wife. There is no scriptural\nground upon which to take such a step in this case. He did not leave\nher, she left him. He did not marry again until she had obtained a\ndivorce. When K divorced herself from J he suffered most keenly,\nand it was not until K had married another man that J married again.\n324\nCounsels on Certain Marriage Situations 325\nThe one he has chosen I feel certain will be a help to him, and he\ncan be a help to her....I see nothing in the Word of God that would\nrequire her to separate from him.

No matter what the gain or the loss,\nwe must act nobly and courageously in the sight of God and our\nSaviour. Let us as Christians who accept the principle that all men,\nwhite and black, are free and equal, adhere to this principle, and not\nbe cowards in the face of the world, and in the face of the heavenly\nintelligences. We should treat the colored man just as respectfully\nas we would treat the white man. And we can now, by precept and\nexample, win others to this course.\nBut there is an objection to the marriage of the white race with\nthe black. All should consider that they have no right to entail upon\ntheir offspring that which will place them at a disadvantage; they\nhave no right to give them as a birthright a condition which would\nsubject them to a life of humiliation. The children of these mixed\nmarriages have a feeling of bitterness toward the parents who have\ngiven them this lifelong inheritance.

I\nhave always had the same counsel to give. No encouragement to\nmarriages of this character should be given among our people. Let\nthe colored brother enter into marriage with a colored sister who is\nworthy, one who loves God, and keeps His commandments. Let the\nwhite sister who contemplates uniting in marriage with the colored\nbrother refuse to take this step, for the Lord is not leading in this\ndirection.\nTime is too precious to be lost in controversy that will arise over\nthis matter. Let not questions of this kind be permitted to call our\nministers from their work. The taking of such a step will create\nconfusion and hindrance. It will not be for the advancement of the\nwork or for the glory of God.\u2014Letter 36, 1912.\nThe Lord looks upon the creatures He has made with compassion,\nno matter to what race they may belong.

One says, \u201cHe who has been prayed for must\nwalk out in faith, giving God the glory, and making use of no reme-\ndies. If he is at a health institute he should leave it at once.\u201d\nI know that these ideas are wrong, and that if accepted they\nwould lead to many evils.\nOn the other hand, I do not wish to say anything that might be\ninterpreted to mean a lack of belief in the efficacy of prayer.\nThe path of faith lies close beside the path of presumption. Satan\nis ever seeking to lead us into false paths. He sees that a misunder-\nstanding of what constitutes faith will confuse and disappoint. He is\npleased when he can persuade men and women to reason from false\npremises.\nI can pray for the sick only in one way\u2014\u201cLord, if it be in accor-\ndance with Thy will, for Thy glory and the good of the one who is[346]\nsick, heal the sufferer, we pray. Not our will, but Thine be done.\u201d\nNehemiah did not regard his duty as done when he had mourned\nand wept and prayed before the Lord. He did not only pray. He\nworked, mingling petition and endeavor.\nIt is no denial of faith to use rational remedies judiciously.\u2014\nManuscript 31, 1911.\n330\nMiraculous Healing 331\nMay Appear as Natural Course\nGod\u2019s miracles do not always bear the outward semblance of\nmiracles. Often they are brought about in a way which looks like the\nnatural course of events. When we pray for the sick, we also work\nfor them. We answer our own prayers by using the remedies within\nour reach. Water, wisely applied, is a most powerful remedy. As it\nis used intelligently, favorable results are seen. God has given us\nintelligence, and He desires us to make the most of His health-giving\nblessings. We ask that God will give bread to the hungry; we are\nthen to act as His helping hand in relieving hunger. We are to use\nevery blessing God has placed within our reach for the deliverance\nof those in danger.\nNatural means, used in accordance with God\u2019s will, bring about\nsupernatural results. We ask for a miracle, and the Lord directs the\nmind to some simple remedy. We ask to be kept from the pestilence\nthat walketh in darkness, that is stalking with such power through\nthe world; we are then to cooperate with God, observing the laws of\nhealth and life. Having done all that we possibly can, we are to keep\nasking in faith for health and strength. We are to eat that food which\nwill preserve the health of the body. God gives us no encouragement\nthat He will do for us what we can do for ourselves. Natural laws are\nto be obeyed. We are not to fail of doing our part. God says to us,\n\u201cWork out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God\nwhich worketh in you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\u201d\n(Philippians 2:12, 13).\nWe cannot disregard the laws of nature without disregarding the [347]\nlaws of God. We cannot expect the Lord to work a miracle for us\nwhile we neglect the simple remedies He has provided for our use,\nwhich, aptly and opportunely applied, will bring about a miraculous\nresult.\nTherefore, pray, believe, and work.\u2014Letter 66, 1901.\nA Case of Healing\nA case was held up before me of_____, a minister; eighty miles\nhe was sent for, to pray for a sick sister who sent for him in com-\npliance with the teaching of James. He went and prayed in earnest,\n332 Selected Messages Book 2\nand she prayed; she believed the minister to be a man of God, a man\nof faith. Physicians had given her up to die of consumption. She\nwas healed immediately. She arose and prepared supper, a thing\nshe had not done for ten years. Now the minister was vile, his life\nwas corrupt, and yet here was a great work. He took the glory all to\nhimself.\nThen again the scene mentioned above passed before me. I saw\nthat the woman was a true disciple of Christ; her faith was that she\nshould be healed. I saw their prayers: One was misty, dark, fell\ndownward; the other prayer was mixed with light or specks which\nlooked to me like diamonds, and arose upward to Jesus and He sent\nit up to His Father like sweet incense, and a beam of light was im-\nmediately sent to the afflicted one and she revived and strengthened\nunder its influence. Said the angel, God will gather every particle of\ntrue, sincere faith; like diamonds shall they be gathered up and will\nsurely bring a return or answer; and God will separate the precious\nfrom the vile. Although He bears long with the hypocrite and sinner,\nyet he will be searched out. Though he may flourish with the honest\na while like the green bay tree, yet the time will come when his folly\nwill be made manifest, and he be brought to confusion.\u2014Letter 2,\n1851.\nWhen Restoration Would Not Be Best\nWe know of instances where the Lord has laid a case of diseased\nhumanity upon the heart of His people and put within them a longing[348]\nof soul, and they have prayed most earnestly for recovery and have\nsupposed they had a right to claim the promise, and yet the sick\ndied. The Lord, who sees the end from the beginning, understood\nthat should He work by His power to heal, the divine will would be\nmisunderstood.\nAt times, restoration would not be best, either for the friends or\nfor the church, but would result in wild enthusiasm and fanaticism,\nleading some to the conclusion that impulse is the ground of our\nfaith. The only safe course is to follow the written Word. After\nyou have done all you can for the sufferer, place the case in the\nhands of the Lord. It may be that death will be for His glory. The\nLord permits some to die who for months and years have lingered in\nMiraculous Healing 333\nsickness. He sees fit to give His suffering ones rest.\u2014Manuscript\n67, 1899.\nChapter 44\u2014The Perils of Hypnosis[349]\n[Counsel supplementary to Medical Ministry, 110-117; Testimonies\nfor the Church 1:290-302; The Ministry of Healing, 241-258.]\nA Warning to Physicians Employing Hypnotic Methods\nBrother and Sister N, in the name of the Lord I ask you to\nremember that unless your sentiments regarding the science of mind\ncure are changed, unless you both understand that you are in decided\nneed of having your own minds converted and transformed, you will\nbe stumbling blocks\u2014pitiful spectacles to angels and to men.\nThe truth has had but little influence over you.

Let me\ntell you that the mind cure is a satanic science. Already you have\ngone far enough in it to endanger seriously your future experience.\nFrom its very first entrance into your mind until the present time,\nit has been a most injurious growth. Unless you can see that Satan\nis the mastermind who has devised this science, it will not be so\neasy a matter as you suppose to separate from it, root and branch.\nThe whole philosophy of this science is a masterpiece of satanic\ndeception. For your souls\u2019 sake, cut loose from everything of this\norder. Every time you put into the mind of another person ideas[350]\nconcerning this science, that you may gain control of his mind, you\nare on Satan\u2019s ground, decidedly cooperating with him. For your\nsouls\u2019 sake, break loose from this snare of the enemy.\nNeither one of you should study the science in which you have\nbeen interested. To study this science is to pluck the fruit from the\ntree of knowledge of good and evil. God forbids you or any other\nmortal to learn or to teach such as science. The fact that you have\nhad anything to do with this science, ought alone to be sufficient to\nshow you, Brother N, the inconsistency of your being the leading\nphysician in the sanitarium\n334\nPerils of Hypnosis 335\nIn dealing with the science of mind cure, you have been eating of\nthe tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which God has forbidden\nyou to touch.

Through\nthis means our great adversary is deceiving thousands, and leading\nthem captive according to his will. The advantage he takes of the\nsciences, sciences which pertain to the human mind, is tremendous.\nHere, serpentlike, he imperceptibly creeps in to corrupt the work of\nGod.\nThis entering in of Satan through the sciences is well devised.\nThrough the channel of phrenology, psychology, and mesmerism,\nhe comes more directly to the people of this generation, and works\nwith that power which is to characterize his efforts near the close\nof probation. The minds of thousands have thus been poisoned,\nand led into infidelity. While it is believed that one human mind\nso wonderfully affects another, Satan, who is ready to press every\nadvantage, insinuates himself, and works on the right hand and on the\nleft. And while those who are devoted to these sciences laud them to\nthe heavens because of the great and good works which they affirm\nare wrought by them, they little know what a power for evil they are\ncherishing; but it is a power which will yet work with all signs and[352]\nlying wonders\u2014with all deceivableness of unrighteousness. Mark\nthe influence of these sciences, dear reader, for the conflict between\nChrist and Satan is not yet ended....\nNeglect of prayer leads men to rely on their own strength, and\nopens the door to temptation. In many cases the imagination is\ncaptivated by scientific research, and men are flattered through the\nconsciousness of their own powers. The sciences which treat of the\nhuman mind are very much exalted. They are good in their place\n[Significant wording in the light of the statement in Testimonies for\nthe Church 1:296.\u2014Compilers.]; but they are seized upon by Satan\nas his powerful agents to deceive and destroy souls. His arts are\nPerils of Hypnosis 337\naccepted as from heaven, and he thus receives the worship which\nsuits him well. The world, which is supposed to be benefited so much\nby phrenology and animal magnetism, never was so corrupt as now.\nThrough these sciences, virtue is destroyed, and the foundations of\nSpiritualism are laid.\u2014The Signs of the Times, November 6, 1884.\nHow to Be Preserved From Deceptive Influences\n[Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, Christian Experience, No. 5.]\nSatan often finds a powerful agency for evil in the power which\none human mind is capable of exerting on another human mind.\nThis influence is so seductive that the person who is being molded\nby it is often unconscious of its power. God has bidden me speak\nwarning against this evil, that His servants may not come under the\ndeceptive power of Satan. The enemy is a master worker, and if\nGod\u2019s people are not constantly led by the Spirit of God, they will\nbe snared and taken.\nFor thousands of years Satan has been experimenting upon the\nproperties of the human mind, and he has learned to know it well. By\nhis subtle workings in these last days, he is linking the human mind\nwith his own, imbuing it with his thoughts; and he is doing this work [353]\nin so deceptive a manner that those who accept his guidance know\nnot that they are being led by him at his will. The great deceiver\nhopes so to confuse the minds of men and women, that none but his\nvoice will be heard.\nWhen Christ revealed to Peter the time of trial and suffering\nthat was just before Him, and Peter replied, \u201cBe it far from Thee,\nLord: this shall not be unto Thee\u201d (Matthew 16:22), the Saviour\ncommanded, \u201cGet thee behind me, Satan\u201d (Matthew 16:23). Satan\nwas speaking through Peter, making him act the part of the tempter.\nSatan\u2019s presence was unsuspected by Peter, but Christ could detect\nthe presence of the deceiver, and in His rebuke to Peter He addressed\nthe real foe.\nOn one occasion, speaking to the twelve, and referring to Judas,\nChrist declared, \u201cOne of you is a devil\u201d (John 6:70). Often in the\ndays of His earthly ministry the Saviour met His adversary in human\nform, when Satan as an unclean spirit took possession of men. Satan\n338 Selected Messages Book 2\ntakes possession of the minds of men today. In my labors in the\ncause of God, I have again and again met those who have been thus\npossessed, and in the name of the Lord I have rebuked the evil spirit.\nIt is not by force that Satan takes possession of the human mind.\nWhile men sleep, the enemy sows tares in the church. While men are\nspiritually sleeping, the enemy accomplishes his work of iniquity.\nIt is when his subject \u201cunderstandeth it not\u201d (Matthew 13:19) that\nhe catcheth away the good seed sown in the heart. When men and\nwomen are in this condition, when their spiritual life is not being\nconstantly fed by the Spirit of God, Satan can imbue them with his\nspirit, and lead them to work his works.. . .\nI entreat that there may be a putting away from the life every\naction which does not bear the approval of God. We are drawing\nnear to the close of earth\u2019s history; the battle is growing daily more\nfierce.\u2014Letter 244, 1907.\nChapter 45\u2014A Call to Country Living [354]\n[Appeared in Country Living. For application of principles here set\nforth to institutional location, see Testimonies for the Church\n7:80-89; Medical Ministry, 308, 309; Evangelism, 76 to 78.]\nI could not sleep past two o\u2019clock this morning. During the night\nseason I was in council. I was pleading with some families to avail\nthemselves of God\u2019s appointed means, and get away from the cities\nto save their children. Some were loitering, making no determined\nefforts.\nThe angels of mercy hurried Lot and his wife and daughters by\ntaking hold of their hands. Had Lot hastened as the Lord desired\nhim to, his wife would not have become a pillar of salt. Lot had too\nmuch of a lingering spirit. Let us not be like him. The same voice\nthat warned Lot to leave Sodom bids us, \u201cCome out from among\nthem, and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean\u201d (2 Corinthians\n6:17). Those who obey this warning will find a refuge. Let every\nman be wide awake for himself, and try to save his family. Let him\ngird himself for the work. God will reveal from point to point what\nto do next.\nHear the voice of God through the apostle Paul: \u201cWork out your\nown salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh\nin you both to will and to do of His good pleasure\u201d (Philippians 2:12,\n13). Lot trod the plain with unwilling and tardy steps. He had so [355]\nlong associated with evil workers that he could not see his peril until\nhis wife stood on the plain a pillar of salt forever.\u2014The Review and\nHerald, December 11, 1900.\nLet children no longer be exposed to the temptations of the\ncities that are ripe for destruction. The Lord has sent us warning\nand counsel to get out of the cities. Then let us make no more\ninvestments in the cities. Fathers and mothers, how do you regard\nthe souls of your children? Are you preparing the members of\nyour families for translation into the heavenly courts? Are you\n339\n340 Selected Messages Book 2\npreparing them to become members of the royal family? children of\nthe heavenly King? \u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the\nwhole world, and lose his own soul?\u201d (Mark 8:36). How will ease,\ncomfort, convenience, compare with the value of the souls of your\nchildren?\u2014Manuscript 76, 1905.\nThe Refuge of Country Places\nLet parents understand that the training of their children is an\nimportant work in the saving of souls. In country places abundant,\nuseful exercise will be found in doing those things that need to be\ndone, and which will give physical health by developing nerve and\nmuscle. \u201cOut of the cities\u201d is my message for the education of our\nchildren.\nGod gave to our first parents the means of true education when\nHe instructed them to till the soil and care for their garden home.\nAfter sin came in, through disobedience to the Lord\u2019s requirements,\nthe work to be done in cultivating the ground was greatly multiplied,\nfor the earth, because of the curse, brought forth weeds and thistles.\nBut the employment itself was not given because of sin. The great\nMaster Himself blessed the work of tilling the soil.\nIt is Satan\u2019s purpose to attract men and women to the cities, and\nto gain his object he invents every kind of novelty and amusement,\nevery kind of excitement. And the cities of the earth today are\nbecoming as were the cities before the Flood....\nWho will be warned? We say again, \u201cOut of the cities.\u201d Do not[356]\nconsider it a great deprivation, that you must go into the hills and\nmountains, but seek for that retirement where you can be alone with\nGod, to learn His will and way.. . .\nI urge our people to make it their lifework to seek for spirituality.\nChrist is at the door. This is why I say to our people, \u201cDo not\nconsider it a privation when you are called to leave the cities and\nmove out into the country places. Here there await rich blessings for\nthose who will grasp them. By beholding the scenes of nature, the\nworks of the Creator, by studying God\u2019s handiwork, imperceptibly\nyou will be changed into the same image.\u201d\u2014Manuscript 85, 1908.\nCall to Country Living 341\nExpect No Miracle to Undo Results of Wrong Course\nI look at these flowers, and every time I see them I think of Eden.\nThey are an expression of God\u2019s love for us. Thus He gives us in this\nworld a little taste of Eden. He wants us to delight in the beautiful\nthings of His creation, and to see in them an expression of what He\nwill do for us.\nHe wants us to live where we can have elbow room. His people\nare not to crowd into the cities. He wants them to take their families\nout of the cities, that they may better prepare for eternal life. In a\nlittle while they will have to leave the cities.\nThese cities are filled with wickedness of every kind\u2014with\nstrikes and murders and suicides. Satan is in them, controlling\nmen in their work of destruction. Under his influence they kill for\nthe sake of killing, and this they will do more and more.. . .\nIf we place ourselves under objectionable influences, can we\nexpect God to work a miracle to undo the results of our wrong\ncourse?\u2014No, indeed. Get out of the cities as soon as possible, and\npurchase a little piece of land, where you can have a garden, where\nyour children can watch the flowers growing, and learn from them\nlessons of simplicity and purity.\u2014The General Conference Bulletin,\nMarch 30, 1903.\nRural Locations for Institutions [357]\nThe instruction is still being given, \u201cMove out of the cities.\nEstablish your sanitariums, your schools, and offices away from the\ncenters of population.\u201d Many now will plead to remain in the cities,\nbut the time will come ere-long when all who wish to avoid the sights\nand sounds of evil will move into the country; for wickedness and\ncorruption will increase to such a degree that the very atmosphere\nof the cities will seem to be polluted.\u2014Letter 26, 1907.\nGod has sent warning after warning that our schools and pub-\nlishing houses and sanitariums are to be established out of the city,\nin places where the youth may be taught most effectively what is\ntruth. Let no one attempt to use the Testimonies to vindicate the\nestablishment of large business interests in the cities. Do not make\nof no effect the light that has been given upon this subject.\n342 Selected Messages Book 2\nMen will arise speaking perverse things, to counterwork the very\nmovements that the Lord is leading His servants to make. But it\nis time that men and women reasoned from cause to effect. It is\ntoo late, too late, to establish large business firms in the cities\u2014too\nlate to call young men and women from the country to the city.\nConditions are arising in the cities that will make it very hard for\nthose of our faith to remain in them. It would therefore be a great\nmistake to invest money in the establishment of business interests in\nthe cities.\u2014Manuscript 76, 1905.\nWorking the Cities From Outposts\nAs far as possible, our institutions should be located away from\nthe cities. We must have workers for these institutions, and if they are\nlocated in the city, that means that families of our people must settle\nnear them. But it is not God\u2019s will that His people shall settle in the\ncities, where there is constant turmoil and confusion. Their children\nshould be spared this; for the whole system is demoralized by the\nhurry and rush and noise. The Lord desires His people to move\ninto the country, where they can settle on the land, and raise their[358]\nown fruit and vegetables, and where their children can be brought in\ndirect contact with the works of God in nature. Take your families\naway from the cities is my message.\nThe truth must be spoken, whether men will hear, or whether\nmen will forbear. The cities are filled with temptation. We should\nplan our work in such a way as to keep our young people as far as\npossible from this contamination.\nThe cities are to be worked from outposts. Said the messenger\nof God, \u201cShall not the cities be warned? Yes; not by God\u2019s people\nliving in them, but by their visiting them, to warn them of what is\ncoming upon the earth.\u201d\u2014Letter 182, 1902.\nChurches, but Not Institutions in the Cities\nRepeatedly the Lord has instructed us that we are to work the\ncities from outpost centers. In these cities we are to have houses of\nworship, as memorials for God; but institutions for the publication\nof our literature, for the healing of the sick, and for the training of\nCall to Country Living 343\nworkers, are to be established outside the cities. Especially is it\nimportant that our youth be shielded from the temptations of city\nlife.\nIt is in harmony with this instruction, that meeting-houses have\nbeen purchased and rededicated in Washington and in Nashville,\nwhile the publishing houses and the sanitariums at these centers\nhave been established away from the congested heart of the cities,\nas outpost centers. This is the plan that has been followed in the\nremoval of other publishing houses and sanitariums into the country,\nand that is now being followed in Great Britain with regard to the\nLondon publishing house and also the training school there. We\nare now given opportunity to advance in the opening providences\nof God by helping our brethren in these and many other important\ncenters to establish the work on a firm basis, in order that it may\nbe carried forward solidly.\u2014Special Testimonies, Series B 08:7-8\n(1907).\nWe are to be wise as serpents and harmless as doves in our [359]\nefforts to secure country properties at a low figure, and from these\noutpost centers we are to work the cities.\u2014Ibid, 14:7 (1902).\nPreparing for the Sunday-Law Crisis\nWe are not to locate ourselves where we will be forced into close\nrelations with those who do not honor God.... A crisis is soon to\ncome in regard to the observance of Sunday....\nThe Sunday party is strengthening itself in its false claims, and\nthis will mean oppression to those who determine to keep the Sab-\nbath of the Lord. We are to place ourselves where we can carry\nout the Sabbath commandment in its fullness. \u201cSix days shalt thou\nlabour,\u201d the Lord declares, \u201cand do all thy work: but the seventh\nday is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any\nwork\u201d (Exodus 20:9, 10). And we are to be careful not to place\nourselves where it will be hard for ourselves and our children to\nkeep the Sabbath.\nIf in the providence of God we can secure places away from the\ncities, the Lord would have us do this. There are troublous times\nbefore us.\u2014Manuscript 99, 1908.\n344 Selected Messages Book 2\nWhen the power invested in kings is allied to goodness, it is\nbecause the one in responsibility is under the divine dictation. When\npower is allied with wickedness, it is allied to satanic agencies,\nand it will work to destroy those who are the Lord\u2019s property. The\nProtestant world have set up an idol sabbath in the place where\nGod\u2019s Sabbath should be, and they are treading in the footsteps of\nthe Papacy. For this reason I see the necessity of the people of God\nmoving out of the cities into retired country [places], where they may\ncultivate the land and raise their own produce. Thus they may bring\ntheir children up with simple, healthful habits. I see the necessity of\nmaking haste to get all things ready for the crisis.\u2014Letter 90, 1897.\nChapter 46\u2014Guided by God\u2019s Providences [360]\nThe time has come, when, as God opens the way, families should\nmove out of the cities. The children should be taken into the country.\nThe parents should get as suitable a place as their means will allow.\nThough the dwelling may be small, yet there should be land in\nconnection with it, that may be cultivated.\u2014Manuscript 50, 1903.\nParents can secure small homes in the country, with land for\ncultivation, where they can have orchards and where they can raise\nvegetables and small fruits to take the place of flesh meat, which\nis so corrupting to the life blood coursing through the veins. On\nsuch places the children will not be surrounded with the corrupting\ninfluences of city life. God will help His people to find such homes\noutside the cities.\u2014Medical Ministry, 310.\nMore and more, as time advances, our people will have to leave\nthe cities. For years we have been instructed that our brethren and\nsisters, and especially families with children, should plan to leave\nthe cities as the way opens before them to do so. Many will have\nto labor earnestly to help open the way. But until it is possible for\nthem to leave, so long as they remain, they should be most active in\ndoing missionary work, however limited their sphere of influence\nmay be.\u2014The Review and Herald, September 27, 1906.\nCounsel and Caution to Those Who Anticipate Leaving the [361]\nCities\n[A communication written December 22, 1893, in reply to a letter\nfrom a leading worker in Battle Creek, informing Mrs. White that\nin response to the admonition that our people should move out of\nBattle Creek, \u201cBetween One and Two Hundred\u201d were preparing to\nleave \u201cAs Soon As Possible.\u201d\u2014Compilers.]\nYour letter tells me, my brother, that there are many who are\nstirred deeply to move out of Battle Creek. There is need, great need,\nof this work being done, and now. Those who have felt at last to\n345\n346 Selected Messages Book 2\nmake a move, let it not be in a rush, in an excitement, or in a rash\nmanner, or in a way that hereafter they will deeply regret that they\ndid move out....\nTake heed that there shall be no rash movements made in heeding\nthe counsel in moving from Battle Creek. Do nothing without\nseeking wisdom of God, who hath promised to give liberally to all\nwho ask, and who upbraideth not. All that anyone can do is to advise\nand counsel, and then leave those who are convicted in regard to\nduty to move under divine guidance, and with their whole hearts\nopen to learn and obey God.\nI am troubled when I consider that there may be even some of our\nteachers who need to be more evenly balanced with sound judgment.\nThe messengers who bear the message of mercy to our world, who\nhave the confidence of the people, will be appealed to for advice.\nGreat caution must be exercised by these men who have not genuine\nexperience in practical life, and who will be in danger of giving\nadvice, ignorant of what that advice may lead others to do.\nSome men have insight into matters, having ability to counsel.\nIt is a gift of God. In moments when the cause of God is in need\nof words, sound and solemn and solid, they can speak words which\nwill lead minds perplexed and in darkness, to see as a quick flash of\nsunlight the course for them to pursue, [the answer to the question]\nwhich has filled them with perplexity and baffled their minds in study[362]\nfor weeks and months. There is an unraveling, a clearing up of the\npath before them, and the Lord has let His sunlight in, and they see\ntheir prayers are answered, their way is made clear. But some rash\nadvice may be given\u2014only get out of Battle Creek, notwithstanding\nthere is nothing clearly defined as to what improvement they will\nmake in spiritual advancement for themselves or others in doing this.\nCarefully Consider Every Move\nLet everyone take time to consider carefully; and not be like\nthe man in the parable who began to build, and was not able to\nfinish.

To understand the will of God is a great\nthing....\nI address words to the church at Battle Creek, to move in the\ncounsels of God. There is need of your moving\u2014many from Battle\nCreek\u2014and there is also need of your having well-defined plans as\nto what you will do when you go out from Battle Creek. Do not go\nin a rush, without knowing what you are about.... O for generals,\nwise and considerate, well-balanced men, who will be safe advisers,\nwho have some insight into human nature, who know how to direct\nand counsel in the fear of God.\nDanger Attends New Experience\nI have seen that danger attends every new phase of experience in\nthe church, because some hear things with such a strong spirit. While\nsome teachers may be strong and efficient in teaching in the lines of [363]\nBible doctrines, they will not all be men who have a knowledge of\npractical life and can advise perplexed minds with surety and safety.\nThey do not discern the perplexing situation that must necessarily\ncome to every family who shall make a change. Therefore, let all\nbe careful what they say; if they know not the mind of God in some\nmatters, let them never speak from a guess or suppose so. If they\nknow nothing definite, let them say so, and let the individual rely\nwholly upon God. Let there be much praying done, and even with\nfasting, that not one shall move in darkness, but move in the light as\nGod is in the light....\nLet there be nothing done in a disorderly manner that there shall\nbe a great loss or sacrifice made upon property because of ardent,\nimpulsive speeches which stir up an enthusiasm which is not after\nthe order of God, that a victory that was essential to be gained, shall,\nfor lack of level-headed moderation and proper contemplation and\nsound principles and purposes, be turned into a defeat. Let there be\n348 Selected Messages Book 2\nwise generalship in this matter, and all move under the guidance of\na wise, unseen Counselor, which is God. Elements that are human\nwill struggle for the mastery, and there may be a work done that\ndoes not bear the signature of God. Now I plead with every soul to\nlook not too strongly and confidently to human counselors, but look\nmost earnestly to God, the One wise in counsel. Submit all your\nways and your will to God\u2019s ways and to God\u2019s will....\nThe Aftermath of Rash Moves\nShould some move hastily and fly out of Battle Creek, and be\nbrought into discouragement, they will reflect, not upon themselves\nfor moving unadvisedly, but upon others who, they will charge,\nbrought a pressure to bear upon them. All their discomfiture and\ndefeat are charged back upon those who should not be reflected\nupon.. . .\nNow, just now, is the time when the perils of the last days are\nthickening around us, and we need wise men for counselors, not\nmen who will feel it duty to stir up and create disorder, but who[364]\ncannot possibly give wise counsel and organize and arrange that\nevery stirring up shall bring order out of confusion, and rest and\npeace in obeying the Word of the Lord.

White articles as they have appeared in our various journals\nand from items published in Notebook Leaflets.\nThese stirring messages do not present anything startlingly new,\nand there is considerable repetition of thought; but to a people who\nare expecting to meet their Lord soon, each statement that has a\nbearing on the crisis before us will be read with eager interest.\nThe closing chapter, \u201cthe last messages to the General Confer-\nence,\u201d represents the two formal statements Mrs. White prepared\nand sent to be read at the General Conference in session in 1913\u2014\nthe last held while she lived. Excerpts from these two messages\nhave appeared elsewhere in print. It seems appropriate that the full\nstatements should be included here, indicating, as they do, Mrs.\nWhite\u2019s confidence in the leaders of the church and its final triumph.\nWhite Trustees.\n352\nChapter 47\u2014Preparing for the Final Crisis [367]\n[Address given by Ellen G. White at General Conference session of\n1891.]\nBrethren and sisters, I appeal to you as Seventh-day Adventists\nto be all that this name signifies. There is danger of departing from\nthe spirit of the message.. . .\nThe people of God are not to be guided by the opinions or\npractices of the world. Hear what the Saviour said to His disciples,\n\u201cI will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter,\nthat he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth; whom\nthe world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth\nhim: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in\nyou\u201d (John 14:16, 17). \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father\nhath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God:\ntherefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not\u201d (1\nJohn 3:1).\nThe Word of God plainly declares that His law is to be scorned,\ntrampled upon, by the world; there will be an extraordinary preva-\nlence of iniquity. The professed Protestant world will form a con-\nfederacy with the man of sin, and the church and the world will be\nin corrupt harmony.\nHere the great crisis is coming upon the world. The Scriptures\nteach that popery is to regain its lost supremacy, and that the fires of [368]\npersecution will be rekindled through the time-serving concessions\nof the so-called Protestant world. In this time of peril we can stand\nonly as we have the truth and the power of God. Men can know\nthe truth only by being themselves partakers of the divine nature.\nWe have need now for more than human wisdom in reading and\nsearching the Scriptures; and if we come to God\u2019s Word with humble\nhearts, He will raise up a standard for us against the lawless element.\nIt is difficult to hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm\nunto the end; and the difficulty increases when there are hidden\n353\n354 Selected Messages Book 2\ninfluences constantly at work to bring in another spirit, a counter-\nworking element, on Satan\u2019s side of the question. In the absence\nof persecution, there have drifted into our ranks some who appear\nsound, and their Christianity unquestionable, but who, if persecution\nshould arise, would go out from us. In the crisis, they would see\nforce in specious reasoning that has had an influence on their minds.\nSatan has prepared various snares to meet varied minds. When the\nlaw of God is made void the church will be sifted by fiery trials, and\na larger proportion than we now anticipate, will give heed to seduc-\ning spirits and doctrines of devils. Instead of being strengthened\nwhen brought into strait places, many prove that they are not living\nbranches of the True Vine; they bore no fruit, and the husbandman\ntaketh them away.\nThe Truly Obedient Will Not Fall\nBut when the world makes void the law of God, what will be\nthe effect upon the truly obedient and righteous? Will they be car-\nried away by the strong current of evil? Because so many rank\nthemselves under the banner of the prince of darkness, will God\u2019s\ncommandment-keeping people swerve from their allegiance? Never!\nNot one who is abiding in Christ will fail or fall. His followers will\nbow in obedience to a higher authority than that of any earthly poten-\ntate. While the contempt placed upon God\u2019s commandments leads\nmany to suppress the truth and show less reverence for it, the faithful\nones will with greater earnestness hold aloft its distinguishing truths.[369]\nWe are not left to our own direction. In all our ways we should\nacknowledge God, and He will direct our paths. We should consult\nHis Word with humble hearts, ask His counsel, give up our will to\nHis. We can do nothing without God.\nThere is the highest reason for us to prize the true Sabbath and\nstand in its defense, for it is the sign which distinguishes the people\nof God from the world. The commandment that the world makes\nvoid is the one to which, for this very reason, God\u2019s people will give\ngreater honor. It is when the unbelieving cast contempt upon the\nWord of God that the faithful Calebs are called for. It is then that\nthey will stand firm at the post of duty, without parade, and without\nswerving because of reproach. The unbelieving spies stood ready\nPreparing for the Final Crisis 355\nto destroy Caleb. He saw the stones in the hands of those who had\nbrought a false report, but this did not deter him; he had a message,\nand he would bear it. The same spirit will be manifested today by\nthose who are true to God.\nThe psalmist says, \u201cThey have made void Thy law. Therefore I\nlove Thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold\u201d (Psalm\n119:126, 127). When men press close to the side of Jesus, when\nChrist is abiding in their hearts by faith, their love for the command-\nments of God grows stronger in proportion to the contempt which\nthe world heaps upon His holy precepts. It is at this time that the true\nSabbath must be brought before the people by both pen and voice.\nAs the fourth commandment and those who observe it are ignored\nand despised, the faithful feel that it is the time not to hide their faith\nbut to exalt the law of Jehovah by unfurling the banner on which is\ninscribed the message of the third angel, the commandments of God\nand the faith of Jesus.\nNo Concessions to the Mystery of Iniquity\nLet not those who have the truth as it is in Jesus give sanction,\neven by their silence, to the work of the mystery of iniquity. Let\nthem never cease to sound the note of alarm. Let the education and\ntraining of the members of our churches be such that the children [370]\nand youth among us shall understand there are to be no concessions\nto this power, the man of sin. Teach them that although the time\nwill come when we can wage the war only at the risk of property\nand liberty, yet the conflict must be met, in the spirit and meekness\nof Christ; the truth is to be maintained and advocated as it is in\nJesus. Wealth, honor, comfort, home\u2014everything else\u2014is to be a\nsecondary consideration. The truth must not be hid, it must not be\ndenied or disguised, but fully avowed, and boldly proclaimed.\nThe Lord has faithful watchmen on the walls of Zion to cry aloud\nand spare not, to lift up their voice like a trumpet, and show His\npeople their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins. The\nLord has permitted the enemy of truth to make a determined effort\nagainst the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. He designs by\nthis means to awaken a decided interest in that question which is a\n356 Selected Messages Book 2\ntest for the last days. This will open the way for the third angel\u2019s\nmessage to be proclaimed with power.\nLet not one who believes the truth, be silent now. None should\nbe careless now; let all urge their petitions at the throne of grace,\npleading the promise, \u201cWhatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will\nI do\u201d (John 14:13). It is a perilous time now. If this land of boasted\nliberty is preparing to sacrifice every principle which enters into her\nConstitution, making decrees to suppress religious freedom, and for\nthe enforcing of papal falsehood and delusion, then the people of\nGod need to present their petitions in faith to the Most High. There\nis every encouragement, in the promises of God, for those who put\ntheir trust in Him. The prospect of being brought into personal\ndanger and distress, need not cause despondency, but should quicken\nthe vigor and hopes of God\u2019s people; for the time of their peril is the\nseason for God to grant them clearer manifestations of His power.\nWe are not to sit in calm expectancy of oppression and tribulation,\nand fold our hands, doing nothing to avert the evil. Let our united\ncries be sent up to heaven. Pray and work, and work and pray. But\nlet none act rashly. Learn as never before that you must be meek[371]\nand lowly in heart. You must not bring a railing accusation against\nany, whether individuals or churches. Learn to deal with minds as\nChrist did. Sharp things must sometimes be spoken; but be sure that\nthe Holy Spirit of God is abiding in your heart before you speak the\nclear-cut truth; then let it cut its way. You are not to do the cutting.\nNot to Unite With the World\nThere is to be no compromise with those who make void the law\nof God. It is not safe to rely upon them as counselors. Our testimony\nis not to be less decided now than formerly; our real position is not\nto be cloaked in order to please the world\u2019s great men. They may\ndesire us to unite with them and accept their plans, and may make\npropositions in regard to our course of action which may give the\nenemy an advantage over us. \u201cSay ye not, A confederacy, to all\nthem to whom this people shall say, A confederacy\u201d (Isaiah 8:12).\nWhile we should not seek for controversy, and should not needlessly\noffend, we must present the truth clearly and decidedly, and stand\nfirm to what God has taught us in His Word. You are not to look to\nPreparing for the Final Crisis 357\nthe world in order to learn what you shall write and publish or what\nyou shall speak. Let all your words and works testify, \u201cWe have not\nfollowed cunningly devised fables\u201d (2 Peter 1:16). \u201cWe have also\na more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take\nheed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place\u201d (2 Peter 1:19).\nThe apostle Paul tells us, \u201cAfter that in the wisdom of God the\nworld by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness\nof preaching to save them that believe\u201d (1 Corinthians 1:21). This\nwas the carrying out of God\u2019s plan for the conviction and conversion\nof men, who are constantly tempted to magnify their own powers.\nThe Lord would make it manifest whether men by their own finite\nwisdom could acquire a knowledge of the truth, whether they could\nknow God, their Creator. When Christ came to our world, the\nexperiment had been fully made, and it proved the boasted wisdom\nto men to be but foolishness. Finite wisdom was utterly unable to [372]\ncome to right conclusions in regard to God, and therefore man was\nwholly incompetent to judge in regard to His law. The Lord has\nallowed matters in our day to come to a crisis, in the exaltation of\nerror above truth, that He, the God of Israel, might work mightily\nfor the greater elevation of His truth in proportion as error is exalted.\nWith His eye upon the church, the Lord has again and again\nallowed matters to come to a crisis, that in their extremity His people\nshould look alone for His help. Their prayers, their faith, together\nwith their steadfast purpose to be true, have called for the interference\nof God, and then He has fulfilled His promise, \u201cThen shalt thou call,\nand the Lord shall answer; thou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I\nam\u201d (Isaiah 58:9). His mighty arm has been stretched out for the\ndeliverance of His people. God reserves His gracious interposition\nin their behalf till the time of their extremity; thus He makes their\ndeliverance more marked, and their victories more glorious. When\nall human wisdom fails, the Lord\u2019s interference will be more clearly\nrecognized, and He will receive the glory that is His due. Even the\nenemies of our faith, persecutors, will perceive that God is working\nfor His people in turning their captivity.\n358 Selected Messages Book 2\nPrayer, Faith, Reliance on God\nWhat is needed in this, our time of danger, is fervent prayer,\nmingled with earnest faith, a reliance upon God when Satan casts\nhis shadow over God\u2019s people. Let everyone bear in mind that God\ndelights to listen to the supplications of His people; for the prevailing\niniquity calls for more earnest prayer, and God has promised that He\nwill avenge His own elect, who cry day and night unto Him, though\nHe bear long with them.\nMen are prone to abuse the long-suffering of God, and to pre-\nsume on His forbearance. But there is a point in human iniquity\nwhen it is time for God to interfere; and terrible are the issues. \u201cThe\nLord is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit\nthe wicked\u201d (Nahum 1:3). The long-suffering of God is wonderful,\nbecause He puts constraint on His own attributes; but punishment[373]\nis nonetheless certain. Every century of profligacy has treasured up\nwrath against the day of wrath; and when the time comes, and the\niniquity is full, then God will do His strange work. It will be found\na terrible thing to have worn out the divine patience; for the wrath\nof God will fall so signally and strongly that it is presented as being\nunmixed with mercy; and the very earth will be desolated. It is at the\ntime of the national apostasy, when, acting on the policy of Satan,\nthe rulers of the land will rank themselves on the side of the man of\nsin\u2014it is then the measure of guilt is full; the national apostasy is\nthe signal for national ruin.\nGod has thrust His people into the gap, to make up the hedge,\nto raise up the foundation of many generations. The heavenly in-\ntelligences, angels that excel in strength, are waiting, obedient to\nHis command, to unite with human agencies; and the Lord will\ninterpose when matters have come to such a pass that none but a\ndivine power can counteract the satanic agencies at work. When His\npeople shall be in the greatest danger, seemingly unable to stand\nagainst the power of Satan, God will work in their behalf. Man\u2019s\nextremity is God\u2019s opportunity.\nNow is the time when the loyal and true are to arise and shine;\nfor the glory of the Lord is risen upon them. It is no time now to\nhide our colors, no time to turn traitors when the battle presses sore,\nPreparing for the Final Crisis 359\nno time to lay aside our weapons of warfare. Watchmen on the walls\nof Zion must be wide awake.\nI am so thankful at this time that we can have our minds taken\noff from the difficulties that surround us, and the oppression that is\nto come upon the people of God, and can look up to the heaven of\nlight and power. If we place ourselves on the side of God, of Christ\nand the heavenly intelligences, the broad shield of Omnipotence is\nover us, the mighty God of Israel is our helper, and we need not fear.\nThose who touch the people of God, touch the apple of His eye.. . .\nBrethren, will you carry the spirit of Christ with you as you [374]\nreturn to your homes and churches? Will you put away unbelief and\ncriticism? We are coming to a time when, more than ever before,\nwe shall need to press together, to labor unitedly. In union there is\nstrength. In discord and disunion there is only weakness. God never\ndesigned that one man, or four, or twenty, should take an important\nwork into their own hands, and carry it forward independently of\nother workers in the cause. God wants His people to counsel together,\nto be a united church, in Christ a perfect whole. The only safety for\nus is to enter into the counsels of heaven, ever seeking to do the will\nof God, to become laborers together with Him. No one company is\nto form a confederacy, and say, \u201cWe are going to take this work, and\ncarry it on in our own way; and if it does not go as we want it to, we\nwill not give our influence to have it go at all.\u201d This is Satan\u2019s voice,\nnot God\u2019s. Do not obey such suggestions.\nWhat we want is the spirit of Jesus. When we have this, we shall\nlove one another. Here are the credentials that we are to bear: \u201cBy\nthis shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one\nto another\u201d (John 13:35).. . .\nPress Together! Press Together!\nSuppose we try daily to have our hearts united in the bonds\nof Christian love. \u201cI have somewhat against thee,\u201d says the True\nWitness, \u201cbecause thou hast left thy first love\u201d (Revelation 2:4).\nAnd He says, \u201cExcept thou repent,\u201d \u201cI will come unto thee quickly,\nand will remove thy candlestick out of his place\u201d (Revelation 2:5).\nWhy?\u2014Because in our separation from one another we are separated\nfrom Christ. We want to press together. Oh, how many times, when\n360 Selected Messages Book 2\nI have seemed to be in the presence of God and holy angels, I have\nheard the angel voice saying, \u201cPress together, press together, press\ntogether. Do not let Satan cast his hellish shadow between brethren.\nPress together; in unity there is strength.\u201d\nI repeat the message to you. As you go to your homes, be deter-\nmined that you will press together; seek God with all the heart, and[375]\nyou will find Him, and the love of Christ, that passeth understanding,\nwill come into your hearts and lives.\u2014General Conference Daily\nBulletin, April 13, 1891.\nThe Sunday-Law Crisis\nIn the night season I seemed to be enumerating in my mind the\nevidences we have to substantiate the faith we hold. We see that\nseducers are waxing worse and worse. We see the world working to\nthe point of establishing by law a false sabbath, and making it a test\nfor all. This question will soon be before us. God\u2019s Sabbath will be\ntrampled under foot, and a false sabbath will be exalted. In a Sunday\nlaw there is possibility for great suffering to those who observe the\nseventh day. The working out of Satan\u2019s plans will bring persecution\nto the people of God. But the faithful servants of God need not fear\nthe outcome of the conflict. If they will follow the pattern set for\nthem in the life of Christ, if they will be true to the requirements of\nGod, their reward will be eternal life, a life that measures with the\nlife of God.\nAt this time a very decided work in character building should\nbe going forward among our people. We are to develop before the\nworld the characteristics of the Saviour. It is impossible to please\nGod without the exercise of genuine, sanctifying faith. We are\nindividually responsible for our faith. True faith is not a faith that\nwill fail under test and trial; it is the gift of God to His people.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, September 30, 1909.\nIf ever we needed to manifest kindness and true courtesy, it is\nnow. We may have to plead most earnestly before legislative councils\nfor the right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience.\nThus in His providence God has designed that the claims of His\nlaw shall be brought before men in positions of highest authority.\nBut as we stand before these men, we are to show no bitterness of\nPreparing for the Final Crisis 361\nfeeling. Constantly we are to pray for divine aid. It is God alone\nwho can hold the four winds until His servants shall be sealed in\ntheir foreheads.\u2014The Review and Herald, February 11, 1904.\nChapter 48\u2014A Work of Purification Needed[376]\nBasel, Switzerland\nDecember 8, 1886\nDear Brethren [G.I.] Butler and [S.N.] Haskell:\nFor weeks I have not been able to sleep after half past three\no\u2019clock. My mind is deeply exercised in regard to our condition as\na people. We ought to be far in advance of any other people on the\nearth because we have greater light and greater knowledge of the\ntruth, which lays us under increased accountability to advance that\nlight and not only to profess to believe the truth but to practice it.\nWhen we do practice the truth we are then following Jesus, who is the\nlight of the world; and if we as a people are not constantly elevating,\nbecoming more and more spiritual minded, we are becoming like\nthe Pharisees\u2014self-righteous\u2014while we do not the will of God.\nWe must have a greater nearness to God. Much less of self and\nmuch more of Jesus Christ and His grace must be brought into our\neveryday life. We are living in an important period of this world\u2019s\nhistory. The end of all things is at hand; the sands of time are fast\nrunning out; soon in heaven it will be said: \u201cIt is done\u201d (Revelation[377]\n21:6). \u201cHe that is holy, let him be holy still,\u201d \u201che which is filthy, let\nhim be filthy still\u201d (Revelation 22:11).\nLet our testimonies be sharpened up; let us have a firmer hold\non God. I cannot refrain from prayer at one, two, and three o\u2019clock\nin the morning for the Lord to work upon the hearts of the people.\nI think of all heaven being interested in the work that is going on\nupon the earth. Ministering angels are waiting about the throne to\ninstantly obey the mandate of Jesus Christ to answer every prayer\noffered in earnest, living faith. I think of how many who profess\nthe truth are keeping it apart from their lives. They do not bring its\nsanctifying, refining, spiritualizing power into their hearts....\n362\nWork of Purification Needed 363\nLiving Below Our Privileges\nWe are far from being the people God would have us to be,\nbecause we do not elevate the soul and refine the character in har-\nmony with the wonderful unfolding of God\u2019s truth and His purposes.\n\u201cRighteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people\u201d\n(Proverbs 14:34). Sin is a disorganizer. Wherever it is cherished\u2014in\nthe individual heart, in the household, in the church\u2014there is disor-\nder, strife, variance, enmity, envy, jealousy, because the enemy of\nman and of God has the controlling power over the mind. But let the\ntruth be loved and brought into the life, as well as advocated, and\nthat man or woman will hate sin and will be a living representative\nof Jesus Christ to the world.\nThe people claiming to believe the truth will not be condemned\nbecause they had not the light, but because they had great light and\ndid not bring their hearts to the test of God\u2019s great moral standard\nof righteousness. The people who claim to believe the truth must\nbe elevated by living it out. Real Bible religion must leaven the\nlife, refine and ennoble the character, making it more and more like\nthe divine model. Then will the home be vocal with prayer, with\nthanksgiving and praise to God. Angels will minister in the home\nand accompany the worshiper to the house of prayer.\nLet the churches who claim to believe the truth, who are advo- [378]\ncating the law of God, keep that law and depart from all iniquity.\nLet the individual members of the church resist the temptations to\npractice evils and indulge in sin. Let the church commence the work\nof purification before God by repentance, humiliation, deep heart\nsearching, for we are in the antitypical day of atonement\u2014solemn\nhour fraught with eternal results.\nLet those who teach the truth present it as it is in Jesus. Under\nthe subduing, sanctifying, refining influence of the truth of God they\nare as clean vessels. Let them be leavened with Bible religion, and\nwhat an influence would go forth from them to the world! Let the\nindividual members of the church be pure, steadfast, unmovable,\nalways abounding in the love of Jesus, and they will then be a light\nto the world. Let the men standing as watchmen and as shepherds of\nthe flock proclaim the solemn truth, sound the notes of warning to\nall people, nations, and tongues. Let them be living representatives\n364 Selected Messages Book 2\nof the truth they advocate, and honor God\u2019s law by strict and holy\ncompliance with its requirements, walking before the Lord in purity,\nin holiness, and a power will attend the proclamation of the truth\nthat will reflect light everywhere.\nGrieving the Spirit of God\nGod never forsakes people or individuals until they forsake Him.\nOutward opposition will not cause the faith of God\u2019s people, who\nare keeping His commandments, to become dim. The neglect to\nbring purity and truth into practice will grieve the Spirit of God and\nweaken them because God is not in their midst to bless. Internal\ncorruption will bring the denunciations of God upon this people as\nit did upon Jerusalem. Oh, let pleading voices, let earnest prayer\nbe heard, that those who preach to others shall not themselves be\ncastaways. My brethren, we know not what is before us, and our\nonly safety is in following the Light of the world. God will work\nwith us and for us if the sins which brought His wrath upon the old[379]\nworld, upon Sodom and Gomorrah and upon ancient Jerusalem, do\nnot become our crime.\nThe least transgression of God\u2019s law brings guilt upon the trans-\ngressor, and without earnest repentance and forsaking of sin he will\nsurely become an apostate.. . . Let us as a people, as far as possible,\ncleanse the camp of moral defilement and aggravating sins. When\nsin is making its march upon the people who claim to be elevating\nthe moral standard of righteousness, how can we expect God to turn\nHis power in our behalf and save us as a people that did righteous-\nness? ... If as a people we do not keep ourselves in the faith and\nnot only advocate with pen and voice the commandments of God,\nbut keep them every one, not violating a single precept knowingly,\nthen weakness and ruin will come upon us. It is a work that we\nmust attend to in every one of our churches. Each man must be a\nChristian.\nPutting Away Sin\nLet the sin of pride be put away, let all superfluities of dress be\novercome, and repentance toward God be exercised for the high-\nhanded robbery toward Him which has withheld money which\nWork of Purification Needed 365\nshould flow into the treasury to sustain the work of God in its mission\nfields. Let the work of reformation, of true conversion, be set before\nand urged upon the people. Let our works, our deportment, corre-\nspond with the work for this time, that we may say, \u201cFollow me as I\nfollow Christ.\u201d Let us humble our souls before God by humiliation,\nfasting and prayer, repentance of sin and putting it away.\nThe voice of the true watchman needs now to be heard all along\nthe line, \u201cThe morning cometh, and also the night\u201d (Isaiah 21:12).\nThe trumpet must give a certain sound for we are in the great day of\nthe Lord\u2019s preparation.... There are many doctrines current in our\nworld. There is many a religion current that numbers its thousands\nand tens of thousands, but there is but one that bears the superscrip-\ntion and the stamp of God. There is a religion of man and a religion\nof God. We must have our souls riveted to the eternal Rock. Every- [380]\nthing in God\u2019s world, both men and doctrines and nature itself, is\nfulfilling God\u2019s sure word of prophecy and accomplishing His grand\nand closing work in this world\u2019s history.\nWe are to be ready and waiting for the orders of God. Nations\nwill be stirred to their very center. Support will be withdrawn from\nthose who proclaim God\u2019s only standard of righteousness, the only\nsure test of character. And all who will not bow to the decree of\nthe national councils and obey the national laws to exalt the sabbath\ninstituted by the man of sin, to the disregard of God\u2019s holy day, will\nfeel, not the oppressive power of popery alone, but of the Protestant\nworld, the image of the beast.\nSatan will work his miracles to deceive; he will set up his power\nas supreme. The church may appear as about to fall, but it does\nnot fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted out\u2014\nthe chaff separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible\nordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but those who have\nbeen overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their\ntestimony will be found with the loyal and true, without spot or stain\nof sin, without guile in their mouths. We must be divested of our\nself-righteousness and arrayed in the righteousness of Christ.\n366 Selected Messages Book 2\nArrayed in Christ\u2019s Righteousness\nThe remnant that purify their souls by obeying the truth gather\nstrength from the trying process, exhibiting the beauty of holiness\namid the surrounding apostasy.

Lift up your thoughts and\nheads and rejoice. Oh, we would think that those who hear the joyful\nnews, who claim to love Jesus, would be filled with joy unutterable\nand full of glory. This is the good, the joyful news which should\nelectrify every soul, which should be repeated in our homes and\ntold to those whom we meet on the street. What more joyful news\ncan be communicated!

I do not mean that cheap faith unsupported by works, but\nthat earnest, living, constant, abiding faith, that eats the flesh and\ndrinks the blood of the Son of God.

Salvation is not\nto be baptized, not to have our names upon the church books, not\nto preach the truth. But it is a living union with Jesus Christ, to be\nrenewed in heart, doing the works of Christ in faith and labor of\nlove, in patience, meekness, and hope. Every soul united to Christ\nwill be a living missionary to all around him. He will labor for those\nnear and those afar off. He will have no sectional feeling, no interest\nmerely to build up one branch of the work over which he presides [382]\nand there let his zeal end.

Awake from the dead, and Christ will give you life. Souls are\nperishing for the light of truth as it is in Jesus. We are standing upon\nthe very borders of the eternal world. Fair-weather Christians will\nnot be wanted for this work. The sentimental and tasteful religion\nis not needed for this time. There must be intensity brought into\nour faith and in the proclamation of truth. I tell you, a new life is\nproceeding from satanic agencies to work with a power we have\n368 Selected Messages Book 2\nnot hitherto realized. And shall not a new power from above take\npossession of God\u2019s people? The truth, sanctifying in its influence,\nmust be urged upon the people. There must be earnest supplications\noffered to God, agonizing prayer to Him, that our hopes as a people\nmay not be founded on suppositions, but on eternal realities. We\nmust know for ourselves, by the evidence of God\u2019s Word, whether[383]\nwe are in the faith, going to heaven or not. The moral standard of\ncharacter is God\u2019s law.

The Sabbath is God\u2019s memorial of His creative\nwork, and it is a sign that is to be kept before the world.\nThere is to be no compromise with those who are worshiping [385]\nan idol sabbath. We are not to spend our time in controversy with\nthose who know the truth, and upon whom the light of truth has been\nshining, when they turn away their ear from the truth to turn to fables.\nI was told that men will employ every policy to make less prominent\nthe difference between the faith of Seventh-day Adventists and those\nwho observe the first day of the week. In this controversy the whole\nworld will be engaged, and the time is short.

This distinctive banner is to be borne through the\nworld to the close of probation. In describing the remnant people\nof God, John says, \u201cHere is the patience of the saints: here are\nthey that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus\u201d\n(Revelation 14:12). This is the law and the gospel. The world and\nthe churches are uniting in harmony in transgressing the law of God,\nin tearing away God\u2019s memorial, and in exalting a sabbath that bears\nthe signature of the man of sin. But the Sabbath of the Lord thy\nGod is to be a sign to show the difference between the obedient and\nthe disobedient. I saw some reaching out their hands to remove the\nbanner, and to obscure its significance....\nWhen the people accept and exalt a spurious sabbath, and turn\nsouls away from obedience and loyalty to God, they will reach the\npoint that was reached by the people in the days of Christ.... Shall\nanyone then choose to hide his banner, to relax his devotion? Shall\nthe people whom God has honored and blessed and prospered, refuse\nto bear testimony in behalf of God\u2019s memorial at the very time when\nsuch a testimony should be borne? Shall not the commandments of\nGod be more highly esteemed when men pour contempt upon the\nlaw of God?\u2014Manuscript 15, 1896.\nThe World is Watching[386]\nGod\u2019s commandment-keeping people are described by the\nprophet as \u201cmen wondered at.\u201d We are to be a people distinct from\nthe world. The eyes of the world are upon us, and we are observed\nby many of whom we have no knowledge. There are those who\nknow something of the doctrines we claim to believe, and they are\nnoting the effect of our faith upon our characters. They are waiting\nto see what kind of influence we exert, and how we carry ourselves\nbefore a faithless world. The angels of heaven are looking upon us.\n\u201cWe are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men\u201d\n(1 Corinthians 4:9).\u2014The Review and Herald, June 18, 1889.\nDistinctive Name and People 371\nThe Future of God\u2019s People\nOur people have been regarded as too insignificant to be worthy\nof notice, but a change will come; the movements are now being\nmade. The Christian world is now making movements which will\nnecessarily bring the commandment-keeping people to notice. There\nis a daily suppression of God\u2019s truth for the theories and false doc-\ntrines of human origin. There are plans and movements being set on\nfoot to enslave the consciences of those who would be loyal to God.\nThe law-making powers will be against God\u2019s people. Every soul\nwill be tested. O that we would as a people be wise for ourselves and\nby precept and example impart that wisdom to our children! Every\nposition of our faith will be searched into, and if we are not thorough\nBible students, established, strengthened, settled, the wisdom of the\nworld\u2019s great men will be too much for us.\u2014Letter 12, 1886.\nChapter 50\u2014The Pillars of Our Faith[387]\n[Written on the train en route to Lynn, Massachusetts, December,\n1890. Appeared in Notebook Leaflets, The Church, No. 4.]\nDuring the past fifty years of my life, I have had precious op-\nportunities to obtain an experience. I have had an experience in the\nfirst, second, and third angels\u2019 messages. The angels are represented\nas flying in the midst of heaven, proclaiming to the world a message\nof warning, and having a direct bearing upon the people living in\nthe last days of this earth\u2019s history. No one hears the voice of these\nangels, for they are a symbol to represent the people of God who are\nworking in harmony with the universe of heaven. Men and women,\nenlightened by the Spirit of God and sanctified through the truth,\nproclaim the three messages in their order.\nI have acted a part in this solemn work. Nearly all my Christian\nexperience is interwoven with it. There are those now living who\nhave an experience similar to my own. They have recognized the\ntruth unfolding for this time; they have kept in step with the great\nLeader, the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host.\nIn the proclamation of the messages, every specification of\nprophecy has been fulfilled. Those who were privileged to act\na part in proclaiming these messages have gained an experience[388]\nwhich is of the highest value to them; and now when we are amid\nthe perils of these last days, when voices will be heard on every side\nsaying, \u201cHere is Christ,\u201d \u201cHere is truth,\u201d while the burden of many\nis to unsettle the foundation of our faith which has led us from the\nchurches and from the world to stand as a peculiar people in the\nworld, like John our testimony will be borne:\n\u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard,\nwhich we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,\nand our hands have handled, of the Word of life; ... that which we\nhave seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have\nfellowship with us\u201d (1 John 1:1-3).\n372\nPillars of Our Faith 373\nI testify the things which I have seen, the things which I have\nheard, the things which my hands have handled of the Word of life.\nAnd this testimony I know to be of the Father and the Son. We have\nseen and do testify that the power of the Holy Ghost has accompanied\nthe presentation of the truth, warning with pen and voice, and giving\nthe messages in their order. To deny this work would be to deny the\nHoly Ghost, and would place us in that company who have departed\nfrom the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits.\nConfidence Assailed\nThe enemy will set everything in operation to uproot the confi-\ndence of the believers in the pillars of our faith in the messages of\nthe past, which have placed us upon the elevated platform of eternal\ntruth, and which have established and given character to the work.\nThe Lord God of Israel has led out His people, unfolding to them\ntruth of heavenly origin. His voice has been heard, and is still heard,\nsaying, \u201cGo forward from strength to strength, from grace to grace,\nfrom glory to glory.\u201d The work is strengthening and broadening, for\nthe Lord God of Israel is the defense of His people.\nThose who have a hold of the truth theoretically, with their finger\ntips as it were, who have not brought its principles into the inner [389]\nsanctuary of the soul, but have kept the vital truth in the outer court,\nwill see nothing sacred in the past history of this people which\nhas made them what they are, and has established them as earnest,\ndetermined, missionary workers in the world.\nThe truth for this time is precious, but those whose hearts have\nnot been broken by falling on the rock Christ Jesus, will not see\nand understand what is truth. They will accept that which pleases\ntheir ideas, and will begin to manufacture another foundation than\nthat which is laid. They will flatter their own vanity and esteem,\nthinking that they are capable of removing the pillars of our faith,\nand replacing them with pillars they have devised.\nThis will continue to be as long as time shall last. Anyone who\nhas been a close student of the Bible will see and understand the\nsolemn position of those who are living in the closing scenes of this\nearth\u2019s history. They will feel their own inefficiency and weakness,\nand will make it their first business to have not merely a form of\n374 Selected Messages Book 2\nGodliness, but a vital connection with God. They will not dare to\nrest until Christ is formed within, the hope of glory. Self will die;\npride will be expelled from the soul, and they will have the meekness\nand gentleness of Christ.\u2014Manuscript 28, 1890.\nNo New Organization\nAfter the passing of the time, God entrusted to His faithful fol-\nlowers the precious principles of present truth. These principles\nwere not given to those who had had no part in the giving of the first\nand second angels\u2019 messages. They were given to the workers who\nhad had a part in the cause from the beginning.\nThose who passed through these experiences are to be as firm as\na rock to the principles that have made us Seventh-day Adventists.\nThey are to be workers together with God, binding up the testimony\nand sealing the law among His disciples. Those who took part in the\nestablishment of our work upon a foundation of Bible truth, those\nwho know the waymarks that have pointed out the right path, are to[390]\nbe regarded as workers of the highest value. They can speak from\npersonal experience, regarding the truths entrusted to them. These\nmen are not to permit their faith to be changed to infidelity; they\nare not to permit the banner of the third angel to be taken from their\nhands. They are to hold the beginning of their confidence firm unto\nthe end.\nThe Lord has declared that the history of the past shall be re-\nhearsed as we enter upon the closing work. Every truth that He has\ngiven for these last days is to be proclaimed to the world. Every\npillar that He has established is to be strengthened. We cannot now\nstep off the foundation that God has established. We cannot now\nenter into any new organization; for this would mean apostasy from\nthe truth.\u2014Manuscript 129, 1905.\nNo Need for Fear\nThere is no need to doubt, to be fearful that the work will not\nsucceed. God is at the head of the work, and He will set everything\nin order. If matters need adjusting at the head of the work, God will\nattend to that, and work to right every wrong. Let us have faith that\nPillars of Our Faith 375\nGod is going to carry the noble ship which bears the people of God\nsafely into port.\nWhen I voyaged from Portland, Maine, to Boston, many years\nago, a storm came upon us, and the great waves dashed us to and\nfro. The chandeliers fell, and the trunks were rolled from side to\nside, like balls. The passengers were frightened, and many were\nscreaming, waiting in expectation of death.\nAfter awhile the pilot came on board. The captain stood near\nthe pilot as he took the wheel, and expressed fear about the course\nin which the ship was directed. \u201cWill you take the wheel?\u201d asked\nthe pilot. The captain was not ready to do that, for he knew that he\nlacked experience.\nThen some of the passengers grew uneasy, and said they feared\nthe pilot would dash them upon the rocks. \u201cWill you take the wheel?\u201d\nasked the pilot; but they knew that they could not manage the wheel.\nWhen you think that the work is in danger, pray, \u201cLord, stand [391]\nat the wheel. Carry us through the perplexity. Bring us safely into\nport.\u201d Have we not reason to believe that the Lord will bring us\nthrough triumphantly?\nThere are before me many who are old hands in the cause. I\nhave known some of you for the last thirty years. Brethren, have\nwe not seen crisis after crisis come upon the work, and has not the\nLord carried us through, and wrought for the glory of His name?\nCan you not believe in Him? Can you not commit the cause to Him?\nYou cannot with your finite minds understand the working of all\nthe providences of God. Let God take care of His own work.\u2014The\nReview and Herald, September 20, 1892.\n\u201cMy Hand is on the Wheel\u201d\nThe coming of the Lord is nearer than when we first believed.\nWhat a wonderful thought it is that the great controversy is nearing\nits end! In the closing work we shall meet with perils that we know\nnot how to deal with; but let us not forget that the three great powers\nof heaven are working, that a divine hand is on the wheel, and that\nGod will bring His purposes to pass. He will gather from the world\na people who will serve Him in righteousness.\n376 Selected Messages Book 2\nFearful perils are before those who bear responsibilities in the\nLord\u2019s work\u2014perils the thought of which makes me tremble.

The judgments of God are abroad\nin the land. Calamities follow one another in rapid succession. Soon\nGod is to rise out of His place to shake terribly the earth, and to\npunish the inhabitants for their iniquity. Then He will stand up in\nbehalf of His people, and will give them His protecting care.

We are living in the\nperils of the last days. A superficial faith results in a superficial\nexperience. There is a repentance that needs to be repented of. All\ngenuine experience in religious doctrines will bear the impress of\nJehovah. All should see the necessity of understanding the truth\nfor themselves individually. We must understand the doctrines that\nhave been studied out carefully and prayerfully. It has been revealed\nto me that there is among our people a great lack of knowledge in\nregard to the rise and progress of the third angel\u2019s message. There is\ngreat need to search the book of Daniel and the book of Revelation,\nand learn the texts thoroughly, that we may know what is written.\nThe light given me has been very forcible that many would go\nout from us, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils.\nThe Lord desires that every soul who claims to believe the truth shall\nhave an intelligent knowledge of what is truth. False prophets will\narise and will deceive many. Everything is to be shaken that can be\nshaken. Then does it not become everyone to understand the reasons\nof our faith? In place of having so many sermons there should be a [393]\nmore close searching of the Word of God, opening the Scriptures,\ntext by text, and searching for the strong evidences that sustain the\nfundamental doctrines that have brought us where we now are, upon\nthe platform of eternal truth.\nCharmed by Spurious Holiness\nMy soul is made very sad to see how quickly some who have had\nlight and truth will accept the deceptions of Satan, and be charmed\nwith a spurious holiness. When men turn away from the landmarks\nthe Lord has established that we may understand our position as\nmarked out in prophecy, they are going they know not whither.\n377\n378 Selected Messages Book 2\nI question whether genuine rebellion is ever curable. Study in\nPatriarchs and Prophetsthe rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.\nThis rebellion was extended, including more than two men. [A\ncomparison is here drawn between Korah\u2019s rebellion and a current\napostasy led by two men in a certain field. See also page 394.] It\nwas led by two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, men\nof renown. Call rebellion by its right name and apostasy by its right\nname, and then consider that the experience of the ancient people\nof God with all its objectionable features was faithfully chronicled\nto pass into history. The Scripture declares, \u201cThese things ... are\nwritten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are\ncome\u201d (1 Corinthians 10:11). And if men and women who have the\nknowledge of the truth are so far separated from their great Leader\nthat they will take the great leader of apostasy and name him Christ\nour Righteousness, it is because they have not sunk deep into the\nmines of the truth. They are not able to distinguish the precious ore\nfrom the base material.\nRead the cautions so abundantly given in the Word of God in\nregard to false prophets that will come in with their heresies, and\nif possible will deceive the very elect. With these warnings, why is\nit that the church does not distinguish the false from the genuine?\nThose who have in any way been thus misled need to humble them-\nselves before God, and sincerely repent, because they have so easily[394]\nbeen led astray. They have not distinguished the voice of the True\nShepherd from that of a stranger. Let all such review this chapter of\ntheir experience.\nFor more than half a century God has been giving His people\nlight through the testimonies of His Spirit. After all this time is it\nleft for a few men and their wives to undeceive the whole church of\nbelievers, declaring Mrs. White a fraud and a deceiver? \u201cBy their\nfruits ye shall know them\u201d (Matthew 7:20).\nThose who can ignore all the evidences which God has given\nthem, and change that blessing into a curse, should tremble for the\nsafety of their own souls. Their candlestick will be removed out\nof its place unless they repent. The Lord has been insulted. The\nstandard of truth, of the first, second, and third angels\u2019 messages has\nbeen left to trail in the dust. If the watchmen are left to mislead the\npeople in this fashion, God will hold some souls responsible for a\nLoyal or Disloyal 379\nlack of keen discernment to discover what kind of provender was\nbeing given to His flock.\nApostasies have occurred and the Lord has permitted matters of\nthis nature to develop in the past in order to show how easily His\npeople will be misled when they depend upon the words of men\ninstead of searching the Scriptures for themselves, as did the noble\nBereans, to see if these things are so. And the Lord has permitted\nthings of this kind to occur that warnings may be given that such\nthings will take place.\nRebellion and Apostasy\nRebellion and apostasy are in the very air we breathe. We shall\nbe affected by them unless we by faith hang our helpless souls\nupon Christ. If men are so easily misled now, how will they stand\nwhen Satan shall personate Christ, and work miracles? Who will be\nunmoved by his misrepresentations then\u2014professing to be Christ\nwhen it is only Satan assuming the person of Christ, and apparently\nworking the works of Christ? What will hold God\u2019s people from\ngiving their allegiance to false christs? \u201cGo not after them\u201d (Luke [395]\n17:23).\nThe doctrines must be plainly understood. The men accepted\nto preach the truth must be anchored; then their vessel will hold\nagainst storm and tempest, because the anchor holds them firmly.\nThe deceptions will increase, and we are to call rebellion by its right\nname. We are to stand with the whole armor on. In this conflict we\ndo not meet men only, but principalities and powers. We wrestle not\nagainst flesh and blood. Let Ephesians 6:10-18 be read carefully and\nimpressively in our churches.\nThose who apostatize are voicing the words of the dragon. We\nhave to meet the satanic agencies who went to make war with the\nsaints. \u201cThe dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make\nwar with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments\nof God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ\u201d (Revelation 12:17).\nThose who apostatize leave the true and faithful people of God, and\nfraternize with those who represent Barabbas. \u201cBy their fruits ye\nshall know them\u201d (Matthew 7:20).\n380 Selected Messages Book 2\nI write this because many in the church are represented to me as\nseeing men like trees walking. They must have another and deeper\nexperience before they discern the snares spread to take them in the\nnet of the deceiver. There must be no halfway work done now. The\nLord calls for stanch, decided, whole-souled men and women to\nstand in the gap, and make up the hedge. [Isaiah 58:12-14 quoted.]\nThere is a decided testimony to be borne by all our ministers\nin all our churches. God has permitted apostasies to take place in\norder to show how little dependence can be placed in man.

Evil angels seek in\nevery way to discourage those who are striving for victory over sin.\nThey hold up before them their past unworthiness, and represent their\ncase as hopeless. But we have an all-powerful Redeemer. Christ\ncame from heaven in the guise of humanity to live the principles\nof righteousness in this world.

Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord\nJesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;\nwho comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to\ncomfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith\nwe ourselves are comforted of God\u201d (2 Corinthians 1:2-4).\n\u201cThanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in\nChrist, and maketh manifest the savour of His knowledge by us in\nevery place. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them\nthat are saved, and in them that perish\u201d (2 Corinthians 2:14, 15).\n\u201cWe preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and our- [399]\nselves your servants for Jesus\u2019 sake. For God, who commanded the\nlight to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the\nlight of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.\nBut we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of\nthe power may be of God, and not of us\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:5-7).\n\u201cFor which cause we faint not; but though our outward man\nperish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light\naffliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the\nthings which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the\n383\n384 Selected Messages Book 2\nthings which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not\nseen are eternal\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:16-18).\nHopefulness and Courage\nIt is the privilege of our representative men in attendance at the\nGeneral Conference to cherish a spirit of hopefulness and courage.\nMy brethren, the Saviour has revealed Himself to you in manifold\nways; He has filled your heart with the sunlight of His presence while\nyou have labored in distant lands and in the homeland; He has kept\nyou through dangers seen and unseen; and now, as you meet once\nmore with your brethren in council, it is your privilege to be glad in\nthe Lord, and to rejoice in the knowledge of His sustaining grace. Let\nHis love take possession of mind and heart. Guard against becoming\noverwearied, careworn, depressed. Bear an uplifting testimony. Turn\nyour eyes away from that which is dark and discouraging, and behold\nJesus, our great Leader, under whose watchful supervision the cause\nof present truth, to which we are giving our lives and our all, is\ndestined to triumph gloriously.\nThe attitude that our representative men maintain during the\nconference will have a telling influence upon all throughout the field,\nas well as upon the delegates themselves. Oh, let it be seen, my\nbrethren, that Jesus is abiding in the heart, sustaining, strengthening,\ncomforting. It is your privilege to be endowed, from day to day,\nwith a rich measure of His Holy Spirit, and to have broadened views\nof the importance and scope of the message we are proclaiming to[400]\nthe world. The Lord is willing to reveal to you wondrous things\nout of His law. Wait before Him with humility of heart. Pray most\nearnestly for an understanding of the times in which we live, for\na fuller conception of His purpose, and for increased efficiency in\nsoulsaving.\nOften in the night season I am bidden to urge our brethren in\nresponsible positions to make earnest effort to follow on to know\nthe Lord more perfectly. When our workers realize as they should\nthe importance of the times in which we live, there will be seen a\ndetermined purpose to be on the Lord\u2019s side, and they will become\nin truth laborers together with God. When they consecrate heart and\nsoul to the service of God, they will find that an experience deeper\nLast Messages to the General Conference 385\nthan any they have yet obtained is essential if they would triumph\nover all sin.\nIt will be well for us to consider what is soon to come upon the\nearth. This is no time for trifling or self-seeking. If the times in\nwhich we are living fail to impress our minds seriously, what can\nreach us? Do not the Scriptures call for a more pure and holy work\nthan we have yet seen?\nA Call to Reconsecration\nMen of clear understanding are needed now. God calls upon\nthose who are willing to be controlled by the Holy Spirit to lead out\nin a work of thorough reformation. I see a crisis before us, and the\nLord calls for His laborers to come into line. Every soul should now\nstand in a position of deeper, truer consecration to God than during\nthe years that have passed.\nDuring the General Conference of 1909 a work should have been\ndone in the hearts of those in attendance that was not done. Hours\nshould have been given up to heart searching, that would have led\nto the breaking up of the fallow ground of the hearts of those who\nwere at the meeting. This would have given them insight to under-\nstand the work so essential to be done by them in repentance and\nconfession. But, though opportunities were given for confession of\nsin, for heartfelt repentance, and for a decided reformation, thorough [401]\nwork was not done. Some felt the influence of the Holy Spirit, and\nresponded; but all did not yield to this influence. The minds of some\nwere running in forbidden channels. Had there been on the part\nof all in the assembly a humbling of heart, there would have been\nmanifested a wonderful blessing.\nFor a number of months after the close of that meeting I bore\na heavy burden, and urged upon the attention of the brethren in\nresponsibility those things which the Lord was instructing me to\nset before them plainly. Finally some of those in positions of trust\nin connection with the general work, after much prayer and careful\nstudy of the various messages given, ventured to undertake by faith\nthe work called for\u2014a work they could not fully understand; and as\nthey went forward in the fear of God, they received rich blessing.\n386 Selected Messages Book 2\nIt has brought great rejoicing to my heart to see the marvelous\ntransformations that have been wrought in the lives of some who thus\nchose to advance by faith in the way of the Lord, rather than to follow\na way of their own choosing. Had those brethren in responsibility\ncontinued to view matters in a false light, they would have created\na condition of things that would sadly have marred the work; but\nwhen they heeded the instruction that was sent, and sought the Lord,\nGod brought them into the full light, and enabled them to render\nacceptable service and to bring about spiritual reformations.\nWhen the Lord sets His hand to prepare the way before His\nministers it is their duty to follow where He directs.

And while I still feel the deepest\nanxiety over the attitude that some are taking toward important\nmeasures connected with the development of the cause of God in\nthe earth, yet I have strong faith in the workers throughout the field,\nand believe that as they meet together and humble themselves before[402]\nthe Lord and consecrate themselves anew to His service, they will\nbe enabled to do His will. There are some who do not even now\nview matters in the right light, but these may learn to see eye to eye\nwith their co-workers, and may avoid making serious mistakes, by\nearnestly seeking the Lord at this time, and by submitting their will\nwholly to the will of God.\nI have been deeply impressed by scenes that have recently passed\nbefore me in the night season. There seemed to be a great move-\nment\u2014a work of revival\u2014going forward in many places. Our people\nwere moving into line, responding to God\u2019s call.

White\u2019s second message to the General Conference\nin session in 1913, was read to the conference by the president, A.\nG. Daniells, Tuesday morning, May 27.]\nRecently in the night season, my mind was impressed by the\nHoly Spirit with the thought that if the Lord is coming as soon as we\nbelieve He is, we ought to be even more active than we have been in\nyears past in getting the truth before the people.\nIn this connection my mind reverted to the activity of the Advent\nbelievers in 1843 and 1844. At that time there was much house-to-\nhouse visitation, and untiring efforts were made to warn the people\nof the things that are spoken of in God\u2019s Word. We should be putting\nforth even greater effort than was put forth by those who proclaimed\nthe first angel\u2019s message so faithfully. We are rapidly approaching [403]\nthe end of this earth\u2019s history; and as we realize that Jesus is indeed\ncoming soon, we shall be aroused to labor as never before. We are\nbidden to sound an alarm to the people. And in our own lives we\nare to show forth the power of truth and righteousness. The world is\nsoon to meet the great Lawgiver over His broken law. Those only\nwho turn from transgression to obedience can hope for pardon and\npeace.\nWe are to raise the banner on which is inscribed, \u201cThe com-\nmandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Obedience to God\u2019s law\nis the great issue. Let it not be put out of sight. We must strive to\narouse church members, and those who make no profession, to see\nand obey the claims of the law of Heaven. We are to magnify this\nlaw and make it honorable.\nChrist has commissioned us to sow the seeds of truth, and to\nurge upon our people the importance of the work to be done by those\nwho are living amidst the closing scenes of this earth\u2019s history. As\nthe words of truth are proclaimed in the highways and the byways,\nthere is to be a revelation of the working of the Spirit of God on\nhuman hearts.\n388 Selected Messages Book 2\nOh, how much good might be accomplished if all who have the\ntruth, the Word of life, would labor for the enlightenment of those\nwho have it not. When the Samaritans came to Christ at the call of\nthe Samaritan woman, Christ spoke of them to His disciples as a\nfield of grain ready for harvesting. \u201cSay not ye, There are yet four\nmonths, and then cometh harvest?\u201d He said, \u201cLift up your eyes, and\nlook on the fields; for they are white already to harvest\u201d (John 4:35).\nChrist abode with the Samaritans for two days; for they were hungry\nto hear the truth. And what busy days they were! As a result of those\ndays of labor, \u201cmany more believed because of his own word\u201d (John\n4:41). This was their testimony: \u201cWe have heard him ourselves, and\nknow that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world\u201d (John\n4:42).\nWho among God\u2019s professing people will take up this sacred\nwork, and labor for the souls who are perishing for lack of knowl-[404]\nedge? The world must be warned. Many places are pointed out\nto me as in need of consecrated, faithful, untiring effort. Christ is\nopening the hearts and minds of many in our large cities. These need\nthe truths of God\u2019s Word; and if we will come into a sacred nearness\nwith Christ, and will seek to draw near to these people, impressions\nfor good will be made. We need to wake up, and enter into sympathy\nwith Christ and with our fellow men. The large and small cities, and\nplaces nigh and afar off, are to be worked, and worked intelligently.\nNever draw back. The Lord will make the right impressions upon\nhearts, if we will work in unison with His Spirit.\nI have words of encouragement for you, my brethren. We are to\nmove forward in faith and hope, expecting large things from God.\nThe enemy will seek in every way to hinder the efforts that are being\nmade to advance the truth, but in the strength of the Lord you may\ngain success.\nLet no discouraging words be spoken, but only such words as\nwill tend to strengthen and sustain your fellow workers.\nA Personal Word\nI long to be personally engaged in earnest work in the field, and\nI should most assuredly be engaged in more public labor did I not\nbelieve that at my age it is not wise to presume on one\u2019s physical\nLast Messages to the General Conference 389\nstrength.

White on the subject of health. This is their background:\nfirst, there was the historic health-reform vision of June 6, 1863.\nNext, in 1864, Mrs. White made her first published presentation of\nthe subject in a 30-page article entitled \u201cHealth,\u201d in Spiritual Gifts,\nvolume IV (currently available in facsimile reprint). Then, in 1865,\nshe furnished one article for each of a series of six pamphlets com-\npiled from various writers and published under the title Health, or\nHow to Live. The six Ellen G. White articles were an amplification\nof the 30-page article in Spiritual Gifts of the year before. Mrs.\nWhite made no other contribution to the How to Live pamphlets.\nTo complete the historical record of the early Ellen G. White\npublished statements relating to health, her articles appear here in\nexact reproduction. Being reproduced word for word, sentence for\nsentence, they contain some grammatical imperfections that crept in\nunder the untoward circumstances of printing a century ago.\nIt should be observed that although Mrs. White never requested\nthe reprinting of these articles, they were republished in short install-\nments in the Review and Herald in 1899 and 1900. The later, fuller\nEllen G. White presentations on the subject of health, climaxed\nby The Ministry of Healing in 1905, took the place of many earlier\narticles, including the \u201cDisease and Its Causes\u201d series.\nThe reader must bear in mind the conditions that existed in the\nfield of medical practice at the time these articles were prepared.\nThe last article, particularly, must be read in the light of conditions\nprevailing at the time of writing. For a review of these conditions\nsee D. E. Robinson, The Story of Our Health Message, 112-130,\n166-169, 427-431 1965 edition,; Francis D. Nichol, Ellen G.

Defor-\nmity, imbecility, disease, and human suffering have been pressing\nheavier and heavier upon each successive generation since the fall,\nand yet the masses are asleep as to the real causes. They do not\nconsider that they themselves are guilty, in a great measure, for this\ndeplorable state of things. They generally charge their sufferings\nupon Providence, and regard God as the author of their woes. But it\nis intemperance, to a greater or less degree, that lies at the foundation\nof all this suffering.\nEve was intemperate in her desires when she put forth the hand\nto take of the fruit-forbidden tree. Self-gratification has reigned\nalmost supreme in the hearts of men and women since the fall. Espe-\ncially has the appetite been indulged, and they have been controlled\nby it, instead of reason. For the sake of gratifying the taste, Eve\ntransgressed the command of God. He had given her everything\nher wants required, yet she was not satisfied. Ever since, her fallen\nsons and daughters have followed the desires of their eyes, and of\ntheir taste. They have, like Eve, disregarded the prohibitions God\nhas made, and have followed in a course of disobedience, and, like\nEve, have flattered themselves that the consequence would not be as\nfearful as had been apprehended.\nMan has disregarded the laws of his being, and disease has been\nsteadily increasing. The cause has been followed by the effect. He\nhas not been satisfied with food which was the most healthful; but\nhas gratified the taste even at the expense of health.\nGod has established the laws of our being. If we violate these\nlaws, we must, sooner or later, pay the penalty. The laws of our\nbeing cannot be more successfully violated than by crowding upon\nthe stomach unhealthy food, because craved by a morbid appetite.[412]\nTo eat to excess, of even simple food, will eventually break down the\ndigestive organs; but add to this the eating in too great an amount of\n396\nChapter 1 397\nfood, and that unwholesome, and the evil is greatly increased. The\nconstitution must become impaired.\nThe human family have been growing more and more self-indul-\ngent, until health has been most successfully sacrificed upon the altar\nof lustful appetite. The inhabitants of the Old World were intemper-\nate in eating and drinking. They would have flesh meats, although\nGod had given them no permission to eat animal food. They ate and\ndrank to excess, and their depraved appetites knew no bounds. They\ngave themselves up to abominable idolatry. They became violent,\nand ferocious, and so corrupt that God could bear with them no\nlonger. Their cup of iniquity was full, and God cleansed the earth of\nits moral pollution by a flood. As men multiplied upon the face of\nthe earth after the flood, they forgot God, and corrupted their ways\nbefore him. Intemperance in every form increased to a great extent.\nThe Lord brought his people out of Egypt in a victorious manner.\nHe led them through the wilderness to prove them, and try them. He\nrepeatedly manifested his miraculous power in their deliverances\nfrom their enemies. He promised to take them to himself, as his\npeculiar treasure, if they would obey his voice, and keep his com-\nmandments. He did not forbid them to eat the flesh of animals, but\nwithheld it from them in a great measure. He provided them food\nwhich was the most healthful. He rained their bread from heaven,\nand gave them purest water from the flinty rock. He made a covenant\nwith them, if they would obey him in all things, he would preserve\nthem from disease.\nBut the Hebrews were not satisfied. They despised the food given\nthem from heaven, and wished themselves back in Egypt where they\ncould sit by the flesh-pots. They preferred slavery, and even death,\nrather than to be deprived of meat. God, in his anger, gave them\nflesh to gratify their lustful appetites, and great numbers of them\ndied while eating the meat for which they had lusted.\nNadab and Abihu were slain by the fire of God\u2019s wrath for\ntheir intemperance in the use of wine. God would have his people\nunderstand that they will be visited according to their obedience\nor transgressions. Crime and disease have increased with every\nsuccessive generation. Intemperance in eating and drinking, and [413]\nthe indulgence of the baser passions, have benumbed the nobler\nfaculties. Appetite, to an alarming extent, has controlled reason.\n398 Selected Messages Book 2\nThe human family have indulged an increasing desire for rich\nfood, until it has become a fashion to crowd all the delicacies possible\ninto the stomach. Especially at parties of pleasure is the appetite\nindulged with but little restraint. Rich dinners and late suppers are\npartaken of, consisting of highly-seasoned meats with rich gravies,\nrich cakes, pies, ice cream, etc.\nProfessed Christians generally take the lead in these fashionable\ngatherings. Large sums of money are sacrificed to the Gods of fash-\nion and appetite, in preparing feasts of health-destroying dainties\nto tempt the appetite, that through this channel something may be\nraised for religious purposes. Thus, ministers, and professed Chris-\ntians, have acted their part and exerted their influence, by precept\nand example, in indulging in intemperance in eating, and in leading\nthe people to health-destroying gluttony. Instead of appealing to\nman\u2019s reason, to his benevolence, his humanity, his nobler faculties,\nthe most successful appeal that can be made is to the appetite.\nThe gratification of the appetite will induce men to give means\nwhen otherwise they would do nothing. What a sad picture for\nChristians! With such sacrifice is God well pleased? How much\nmore acceptable to him was the widow\u2019s mite. Such as follow her\nexample from the heart, will have well done. To have the blessing\nof Heaven attend the sacrifice thus made, can make the simplest\noffering of the highest value.\nMen and women who profess to be followers of Christ, are\noften slaves to fashion, and to a gluttonous appetite. Preparatory to\nfashionable gatherings, time and strength, which should be devoted\nto higher and nobler purposes, are expended in cooking a variety\nof unwholesome dishes. Because it is fashion, many who are poor\nand dependent upon their daily labor, will be to the expense of\npreparing different kinds of rich cakes, preserves, pies, and a variety\nof fashionable food for visitors, which only injure those who partake\nof them; when, at the same time they need the amount thus expended,\nto purchase clothing for themselves and children. This time occupied\nin cooking food to gratify the taste to the expense of the stomach,[414]\nshould be devoted to the moral and religious instruction of their\nchildren.\nFashionable visiting is made an occasion of gluttony. Hurtful\nfood and drinks are partaken of in such a measure as to greatly tax\nChapter 1 399\nthe organs of digestion. The vital forces are called into unneces-\nsary action in the disposal of it, which produces exhaustion, and\ngreatly disturbs the circulation of the blood, and, as a result, want\nof vital energy is felt throughout the system. The blessings which\nmight result from social visiting, are often lost, for the reason that\nyour entertainer, instead of being profited by your conversation, is\ntoiling over the cook-stove, preparing a variety of dishes for you\nto feast upon. Christian men and women should never permit their\ninfluence to countenance such a course by eating of the dainties thus\nprepared. Let them understand that your object in visiting them is\nnot to indulge the appetite, but that your associating together, and\ninterchange of thoughts and feelings, might be a mutual blessing.\nThe conversation should be of that elevated, ennobling character\nwhich could afterward be called to remembrance with feelings of\nthe highest pleasure.\nThose who entertain visitors, should have wholesome, nutri-\ntious food, from fruits, grains, and vegetables, prepared in a simple,\ntasteful manner. Such cooking will require but little extra labor or\nexpense, and, partaken of in moderate quantities, will not injure\nany one. If worldlings choose to sacrifice time, money, and health,\nto gratify the appetite, let them do so, and pay the penalty of the\nviolation of the laws of health; but Christians should take their posi-\ntion in regard to these things, and exert their influence in the right\ndirection. They can do much in reforming these fashionable, health\nand soul-destroying customs.\nMany indulge in the pernicious habit of eating just before sleep-\ning hours. They may have taken three regular meals; yet because\nthey feel a sense of faintness, as though hungry, will eat a lunch, or\nfourth meal. By indulging this wrong practice, it has become a habit,\nand they feel as though they could not sleep without taking a lunch\nbefore retiring. In many cases, the cause of this faintness is because\nthe digestive organs have been already too severely taxed through\nthe day in disposing of unwholesome food forced upon the stomach\ntoo frequently, and in too great quantities. The digestive organs thus\ntaxed become weary, and need a period of entire rest from labor [415]\nto recover their exhausted energies. A second meal should never\nbe eaten until the stomach has had time to rest from the labor of\n400 Selected Messages Book 2\ndigesting the preceding meal. If a third meal be eaten at all, it should\nbe light, and several hours before going to bed.\nBut with many, the poor tired stomach may complain of weari-\nness in vain. More food is forced upon it, which sets the digestive\norgans in motion, again to perform the same round of labor through\nthe sleeping hours. The sleep of such is generally disturbed with un-\npleasant dreams, and in the morning they awake unrefreshed. There\nis a sense of languor and loss of appetite. A lack of energy is felt\nthrough the entire system. In a short time the digestive organs are\nworn out, for they have had no time to rest. These become miserable\ndyspeptics, and wonder what has made them so. The cause has\nbrought the sure result. If this practice be indulged in a great length\nof time, the health will become seriously impaired. The blood be-\ncomes impure, the complexion sallow, and eruptions will frequently\nappear. You will often hear complaints from such, of frequent pains\nand soreness in the region of the stomach, and while performing\nlabor, the stomach becomes so tired that they are obliged to desist\nfrom work, and rest. They seem to be at loss to account for this state\nof things; for, setting this aside, they are apparently healthy.\nThose who are changing from three meals a day, to two, will\nat first be troubled more or less with faintness, especially about the\ntime they have been in the habit of eating their third meal. But if\nthey persevere for a short time, this faintness will disappear.\nThe stomach, when we lie down to rest, should have its work all\ndone, that it may enjoy rest, as well as other portions of the body.\nThe work of digestion should not be carried on through any period\nof the sleeping hours. After the stomach, which has been overtaxed,\nhas performed its task, it becomes exhausted, which causes faintness.\nHere many are deceived, and think that it is the want of food which\nproduces such feelings, and without giving the stomach time to rest,\nthey take more food, which for the time removes the faintness. And\nthe more the appetite is indulged, the more will be its clamors for\ngratification. This faintness is generally the result of meat-eating,\nand eating frequently, and too much. The stomach becomes weary[416]\nby being kept constantly at work, disposing of food not the most\nhealthful. Having no time for rest, the digestive organs become\nenfeebled, hence the sense of \u201cgoneness,\u201d and desire for frequent\neating. The remedy such require, is to eat less frequently and less\nChapter 1 401\nliberally, and be satisfied with plain, simple food, eating twice, or, at\nmost, three times a day. The stomach must have its regular periods\nfor labor and rest, hence eating irregularly and between meals, is a\nmost pernicious violation of the laws of health. With regular habits,\nand proper food, the stomach will gradually recover.\nBecause it is the fashion, in harmony with morbid appetite, rich\ncake, pies, and puddings, and every hurtful thing, are crowded into\nthe stomach. The table must be loaded down with a variety, or the\ndepraved appetite cannot be satisfied. In the morning, these slaves\nto appetite often have impure breath, and a furred tongue. They do\nnot enjoy health, and wonder why they suffer with pains, headaches,\nand various ills. The cause has brought the sure result.\nIn order to preserve health, temperance in all things is necessary.\nTemperance in labor, temperance in eating and drinking.\nMany are so devoted to intemperance that they will not change\ntheir course of indulging in gluttony under any considerations. They\nwould sooner sacrifice health, and die prematurely, than to restrain\nthe intemperate appetite. And there are many who are ignorant of\nthe relation their eating and drinking has to health. Could such be\nenlightened, they might have moral courage to deny the appetite,\nand eat more sparingly, and of that food alone which was healthful,\nand by their own course of action save themselves a great amount of\nsuffering.\nEfforts should be made to preserve carefully the remaining\nstrength of the vital forces, by lifting off every overtasking burden.\nThe stomach may never fully recover health, but a proper course of\ndiet will save further debility, and many will recover more or less,\nunless they have gone very far in gluttonous self-murder.\nThose who permit themselves to become slaves to a morbid\nappetite, often go still further, and debase themselves by indulging\ntheir corrupt passions, which have become excited by intemperance\nin eating and in drinking. They give loose rein to their debasing [417]\npassions, until health and intellect greatly suffer. The reasoning\nfaculties are, in a great measure, destroyed by evil habits.\nI have wondered that the inhabitants of the earth were not de-\nstroyed, like the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. I have seen reason\nenough for the present state of degeneracy and mortality in the world.\n402 Selected Messages Book 2\nBlind passion controls reason, and every high consideration with\nmany is sacrificed to lust.\nThe first great evil was intemperance in eating and drinking.\nMen and women have made themselves slaves to appetite.\nPork although one of the most common articles of diet, is one of\nthe most injurious. God did not prohibit the Hebrews from eating\nswine\u2019s flesh merely to show his authority, but because it was not a\nproper article of food for man. It would fill the system with scrofula,\nand especially in that warm climate produced leprosy, and disease\nof various kinds. Its influence upon the system in that climate was\nfar more injurious than in a colder climate. But God never designed\nthe swine to be eaten under any circumstances. The heathen used\npork as an article of food, and American people have used pork\nfreely as an important article of diet. Swine\u2019s flesh would not be\npalatable to the taste in its natural state. It is made agreeable to the\nappetite by highly seasoning, which makes a very bad thing worse.\nSwine\u2019s flesh above all other flesh-meats, produces a bad state of the\nblood. Those who eat freely of pork can but be diseased. Those who\nhave much out-door exercise do not realize the bad effects of pork\neating as those do whose life is mostly in-doors, and whose habits\nare sedentary, and whose labor is mental.\nBut it is not the physical health alone which is injured by pork-\neating. The mind is affected, and the finer sensibilities are blunted by\nthe use of this gross article of food. It is impossible for the flesh of\nany living creature to be healthy when filth is their natural element,\nand when they will feed upon every detestable thing. The flesh of\nswine is composed of what they eat. If human beings eat their flesh,\ntheir blood and their flesh will be corrupted by impurities conveyed\nto them through the swine.\nThe eating of pork has produced scrofula, leprosy, and cancerous\nhumors. Pork-eating is still causing the most intense suffering to\nthe human race. Depraved appetites crave those things which are[418]\nthe most injurious to health. The curse, which has rested heavily\nupon the earth, and has been felt by the whole race of mankind, has\nalso been felt by the animals. The beasts have degenerated in size,\nand length of years. They have been made to suffer more than they\notherwise would, by the wrong habits of man.\nChapter 1 403\nThere are but few animals that are free from disease. Many\nhave been made to suffer greatly for the want of light, pure air, and\nwholesome food. When they are fattened, they are often confined\nin close stables, and are not permitted to exercise, and to enjoy free\ncirculation of air. Many poor animals are left to breathe the poison\nof filth which is left in barns and stables. Their lungs will not long\nremain healthy while inhaling such impurities. Disease is conveyed\nto the liver, and the entire system of the animal is diseased. They\nare killed, and prepared for the market, and people eat freely of this\npoisonous animal food. Much disease is caused in this manner. But\npeople cannot be made to believe that it is the meat they have eaten,\nwhich has poisoned their blood, and caused their sufferings. Many\ndie of disease caused wholly by meat-eating, yet the world does not\nseem to be the wiser.\nBecause those who partake of animal food do not immediately\nfeel its effects, is no evidence it does not injure them. It may be\ndoing its work surely upon the system, and yet the persons for the\ntime being realize nothing of it.\nAnimals are crowded into close cars, and are almost wholly de-\nprived of air and light, food and water, and are carried thus thousands\nof miles, breathing the foul air arising from accumulated filth, and\nwhen they arrive at their place of destination, and are taken from the\ncars, many are in a half starved, smothered, dying condition, and\nif left alone, would die of themselves. But the butcher finishes the\nwork, and prepares the flesh for market.\nAnimals are frequently killed that have been driven quite a dis-\ntance for the slaughter. Their blood has become heated. They are full\nof flesh, and have been deprived of healthy exercise, and when they\nhave to travel far, they become surfeited, and exhausted, and in that\ncondition are killed for market. Their blood is highly inflamed, and\nthose who eat of their meat, eat poison. Some are not immediately\naffected, while others are attacked with severe pain, and die from\nfever, cholera, or some unknown disease. Very many animals are [419]\nsold for the city market, known to be diseased by those who have\nsold them, and those who buy them for the market are not always\nignorant of the matter. Especially in larger cities this is practiced to a\ngreat extent, and meat-eaters know not that they are eating diseased\nanimals.\n404 Selected Messages Book 2\nSome animals that are brought to the slaughter seem to realize\nwhat is to take place, and they become furious, and literally mad.\nThey are killed while in that state; and their flesh prepared for market.\nTheir meat is poison, and has produced, in those who have eaten\nit, cramp, convulsions, apoplexy, and sudden death. Yet the cause\nof all this suffering is not attributed to meat. Some animals are\ninhumanly treated while being brought to the slaughter. They are\nliterally tortured, and after they have endured many hours of extreme\nsuffering, are butchered. Swine have been prepared for market even\nwhile the plague was upon them, and their poisonous flesh has spread\ncontagious diseases, and great mortality has followed.\u2014How to Live,\nNo. 1, 51-60.\nChapter 2 [420]\nMen and women, by indulging the appetite in eating rich and\nhighly-seasoned foods, especially flesh-meats, with rich gravies,\nand by using stimulating drinks, as tea and coffee, create unnatural\nappetites. The system becomes fevered, the organs of digestion\nbecome injured, the mental faculties are beclouded, while the baser\npassions are excited, and predominate over the nobler faculties. The\nappetite becomes more unnatural, and more difficult of restraint. The\ncirculation of the blood is not equalized, and becomes impure. The\nwhole system is deranged, and the demands of appetite become more\nunreasonable, craving exciting, hurtful things, until it is thoroughly\ndepraved.\nWith many, the appetite clamors for the disgusting weed, to-\nbacco, and ale, made powerful by poisonous, health-destroying\nmixtures. Many do not stop even here. Their debased appetites\ncall for stronger drink, which has a still more benumbing influence\nupon the brain. Thus they give themselves up to every excess, until\nappetite holds complete control over the reasoning faculties; and\nman, formed in the image of his Maker, debases himself lower than\nthe beasts. Manhood and honor are alike sacrificed to appetite. It\nrequired time to benumb the sensibilities of the mind. It was done\ngradually, but surely. The indulgence of the appetite in first eating\nfood highly seasoned, created a morbid appetite, and prepared the\nway for every kind of indulgence, until health and intellect were\nsacrificed to lust.\nMany have entered the marriage relation who have not acquired\nproperty, and who have had no inheritance. They did not possess\nphysical strength, or mental energy, to acquire property. It has been\njust such ones who have been in haste to marry, and who have\ntaken upon themselves responsibilities of which they had no just\nsense. They did not possess noble, elevated feelings, and had no\njust idea of the duty of a husband and father, and what it would cost [421]\nthem to provide for the wants of a family. And they manifested\n405\n406 Selected Messages Book 2\nno more propriety in the increase of their families than that shown\nin their business transactions. Those who are seriously deficient\nin business tact, and who are the least qualified to get along in the\nworld, generally fill their houses with children; while men who have\nability to acquire property generally have no more children than they\ncan well provide for. Those who are not qualified to take care of\nthemselves should not have children. It has been the case that the\nnumerous offspring of these poor calculators are left to come up like\nthe brutes. They are not suitably fed or clothed, and do not receive\nphysical or mental training, and there is nothing sacred in the word,\nhome, to either parents or children.\nThe marriage institution was designed of Heaven to be a blessing\nto man; but in a general sense it has been abused in such a manner\nas to make it a dreadful curse. Most men and women have acted, in\nentering the marriage relation, as though the only question for them\nto settle was whether they loved each other. But they should realize\nthat a responsibility rests upon them in their marriage relation farther\nthan this. They should consider whether their offspring will possess\nphysical health, and mental and moral strength. But few have moved\nwith high motives, and with elevated considerations\u2014that society\nhad claims upon them which they could not lightly throw off\u2014that\nthe weight of their families\u2019 influence would tell in the upward or\ndownward scale.\nSociety is composed of families. And heads of families are\nresponsible for the molding of society. If those who choose to enter\nthe marriage relation without due consideration were alone to be the\nsufferers, then the evil would not be as great, and their sin would be\ncomparatively small. But the misery arising from unhappy marriages\nis felt by the offspring of such unions. They have entailed upon them\na life of living misery; and though innocent, suffer the consequences\nof their parents\u2019 inconsiderate course. Men and women have no right\nto follow impulse, or blind passion, in their marriage relation, and\nthen bring innocent children into the world to realize from various\ncauses that life has but little joy, but little happiness, and is therefore\na burden.\nChildren generally inherit the peculiar traits of character which[422]\nthe parents possess, and in addition to all this, many come up without\nany redeeming influence around them. They are too frequently\nChapter 2 407\nhuddled together in poverty and filth. With such surroundings and\nexamples, what can be expected of the children when they come\nupon the stage of action, but that they will sink lower in the scale of\nmoral worth than their parents, and their deficiencies in every respect\nbe more apparent than theirs? Thus has this class perpetuated their\ndeficiencies, and cursed their posterity with poverty, imbecility, and\ndegradation. These should not have married. At least, they should\nnot have brought innocent children into existence to share their\nmisery, and hand down their own deficiencies, with accumulating\nwretchedness, from generation to generation, which is one great\ncause of the degeneracy of the race.\nIf women of past generations had always moved from high con-\nsiderations, realizing that future generations would be ennobled or\ndebased by their course of action, they would have taken their stand,\nthat they could not unite their life interest with men who were cher-\nishing unnatural appetites for alcoholic drinks, and tobacco which is\na slow, but sure and deadly poison, weakening the nervous system,\nand debasing the noble faculties of the mind. If men would remain\nwedded to these vile habits, women should have left them to their\nlife of single blessedness, to enjoy these companions of their choice.\nWomen should not have considered themselves of so little value as to\nunite their destiny with men who had no control over their appetites,\nbut whose principal happiness consisted in eating and drinking, and\ngratifying their animal passions. Women have not always followed\nthe dictates of reason instead of impulse. They have not felt in a\nhigh degree the responsibilities resting upon them, to form such life\nconnections as would not enstamp upon their offspring a low degree\nof morals, and a passion to gratify debased appetites, at the expense\nof health, and even life. God will hold them accountable in a large\ndegree for the physical health and moral characters thus transmitted\nto future generations.\nMen and women who have corrupted their own bodies by dis-\nsolute habits, have also debased their intellects, and destroyed the\nfine sensibilities of the soul. Very many of this class have married,\nand left for an inheritance to their offspring, the taints of their own\nphysical debility and depraved morals. The gratification of animal [423]\npassions, and gross sensuality, have been the marked characters of\ntheir posterity, which have descended from generation to genera-\n408 Selected Messages Book 2\ntion, increasing human misery to a fearful degree, and hastening the\ndepreciation of the race.\nMen and women who have become sickly and diseased, have\noften in their marriage connections selfishly thought only of their\nown happiness. They have not seriously considered the matter from\nthe standpoint of noble, elevated principles, reasoning in regard to\nwhat they could expect of their posterity, but diminished energy of\nbody and mind, which would not elevate society, but sink it still\nlower.\nSickly men have often won the affections of women apparently\nhealthy, and because they loved each other, they felt themselves\nat perfect liberty to marry, neither considering that by their union\nthe wife must be a sufferer, more or less, because of the diseased\nhusband. In many cases the diseased husband improves in health,\nwhile the wife shares his disease. He lives very much upon her\nvitality, and she soon complains of failing health. He prolongs his\ndays by shortening the days of his wife. Those who thus marry\ncommit sin in lightly regarding health and life given to them of God\nto be used to his glory. But if those who thus enter the marriage\nrelation were alone concerned, the sin would not be so great. Their\noffspring are compelled to be sufferers by disease transmitted to\nthem. Thus disease has been perpetuated from generation to gen-\neration. And many charge all this weight of human misery upon\nGod, when their wrong course of action has brought the sure result.\nThey have thrown upon society an enfeebled race, and done their\npart to deteriorate the race, by rendering disease hereditary, and thus\naccumulating human suffering.\nAnother cause of the deficiency of the present generation in\nphysical strength and moral worth, is, men and women uniting in\nmarriage whose ages widely differ. It is frequently the case that\nold men choose to marry young wives. By thus doing the life of\nthe husband has often been prolonged, while the wife has had to\nfeel the want of that vitality which she has imparted to her aged\nhusband. It has not been the duty of any woman to sacrifice life\nand health, even if she did love one so much older than herself, and\nfelt willing on her part to make such a sacrifice. She should have\nrestrained her affections. She had considerations higher than her own[424]\ninterest to consult. She should consider, if children be born to them,\nChapter 2 409\nwhat would be their condition? It is still worse for young men to\nmarry women considerably older than themselves. The offspring of\nsuch unions in many cases, where ages widely differ, have not well-\nbalanced minds. They have been deficient also in physical strength.\nIn such families have frequently been manifested varied, peculiar,\nand often painful, traits of character. They often die prematurely, and\nthose who reach maturity, in many cases, are deficient in physical\nand mental strength, and moral worth.\nThe father is seldom prepared, with his failing faculties, to prop-\nerly bring up his young family. These children have peculiar traits of\ncharacter, which constantly need a counteracting influence, or they\nwill go to certain ruin. They are not educated aright. Their discipline\nhas too often been of the fitful impulsive kind by reason of his age.\nThe father has been susceptible of changeable feelings. At one time\nover indulgent, while at another he is unwarrantably severe. Every\nthing in some such families is wrong, and domestic wretchedness\nis greatly increased. Thus a class of beings have been thrown upon\nthe world as a burden to society. Their parents were accountable in\na great degree for the characters developed by their children, which\nare transmitted from generation to generation.\nThose who increase their number of children, when if they con-\nsulted reason, they must know that physical and mental weakness\nmust be their inheritance, are transgressors of the last six precepts of\nGod\u2019s law, which specify the duty of man to his fellow man. They\ndo their part in increasing the degeneracy of the race, and in sinking\nsociety lower, thus injuring their neighbor. If God thus regards the\nrights of neighbors, has he no care in regard to closer, and more\nsacred relationship? If not a sparrow falls to the ground without his\nnotice, will he be unmindful of the children born into the world,\ndiseased physically and mentally, suffering in a greater or less de-\ngree, all their lives? Will he not call parents to an account, to whom\nhe has given reasoning powers, for putting these higher faculties\nin the background, and becoming slaves to passion, when, as the\nresult, generations must bear the mark of their physical, mental, and\nmoral deficiencies? In addition to the suffering they entail upon their\nchildren, they have no portion but poverty to leave to their pitiful\nflock. They cannot educate them, and many do not see the necessity, [425]\nneither could they if they did, find time to train them, and instruct\n410 Selected Messages Book 2\nthem, and lessen, as much as possible, the wretched inheritance\ntransmitted to them. Parents should not increase their families any\nfaster than they know that their children can be well cared for, and\neducated. A child in the mother\u2019s arms from year to year is great\ninjustice to her. It lessens, and often destroys, social enjoyment, and\nincreases domestic wretchedness. It robs their children of that care,\neducation, and happiness, which parents should feel it their duty to\nbestow upon them.\nThe husband violates the marriage vow, and the duties enjoined\nupon him in the word of God, when he disregards the health and hap-\npiness of the wife, by increasing her burdens and cares by numerous\noffspring. \u201cHusbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the\nchurch, and gave Himself for it.\u201d \u201cSo ought men to love their wives\nas their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no\nman ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it,\neven as the Lord the church\u201d (Ephesians 5:25, 28, 29).\nWe see this holy injunction almost wholly disregarded, even\nby professed Christians. Everywhere you may look, you will see\npale, sickly, careworn, broken-down, dispirited, discouraged women.\nThey are generally over-worked, and their vital energies exhausted\nby frequent child-bearing. The world is filled with images of hu-\nman beings who are of no worth to society. Many are deficient in\nintellect, and many who possess natural talents do not use them for\nany beneficial purposes. They are not cultivated, and the one great\nreason is, children have been multiplied faster than they could be\nwell trained, and have been left to come up much like the brutes.\nChildren in this age are suffering with their parents, more or\nless, the penalty of the violation of the laws of health. The course\ngenerally pursued with them, from their infancy, is in continual\nopposition to the laws of their being. They were compelled to\nreceive a miserable inheritance of disease and debility, before their\nbirth, occasioned by the wrong habits of their parents, which will\naffect them in a greater or less degree through life. This bad state of\nthings is made every way worse by parents\u2019 continuing to follow a\nwrong course in the physical training of their children during their\nchildhood.\nParents manifest astonishing ignorance, indifference, and reck-[426]\nlessness, in regard to the physical health of their children, which\nChapter 2 411\noften results in destroying the little vitality left the abused infant,\nand consigns it to an early grave. You will frequently hear parents\nmourning over the providence of God which has torn their children\nfrom their embrace. Our heavenly father is too wise to err, and too\ngood to do us wrong. He has no delight in seeing his creatures\nsuffer. Thousands have been ruined for life because parents have\nnot acted in accordance with the laws of health. They have moved\nfrom impulse, instead of following the dictates of sound judgment,\nconstantly having in view the future well-being of their children.\nThe first great object to be attained in the training of children\nis soundness of constitution which will prepare the way in a great\nmeasure for mental and moral training. Physical and moral health\nare closely united. What an enormous weight of responsibility rests\nupon parents, when we consider the course pursued by them, before\nthe birth of their children, has very much to do with the development\nof their character after their birth.\nMany children are left to come up with less attention from their\nparents than a good farmer devotes to his dumb animals. Fathers,\nespecially, are often guilty of manifesting less care for wife and\nchildren than that shown to their cattle. A merciful farmer will take\ntime, and devote especial thought as to the best manner of managing\nhis stock, and will be particular that his valuable horses shall not be\noverworked, overfed, or fed when heated, lest they be ruined. He\nwill take time and care for his stock, lest they be injured by neglect,\nexposure, or any improper treatment, and his increasing young stock\ndepreciate in value. He will observe regular periods for their eating,\nand will know the amount of work they can perform without injuring\nthem. In order to accomplish this, he will provide them only the most\nhealthful food, in proper quantities, and at stated periods. By thus\nfollowing the dictates of reason, farmers are successful in preserving\nthe strength of their beasts. If the interest of every father, for his wife\nand children, corresponded to that care manifested for his cattle, in\nthat degree that their lives are more valuable than the dumb animals,\nthere would be an entire reformation in every family, and human\nmisery be far less.\nGreat care should be manifested by parents in providing the most [427]\nhealthful articles of food for themselves and for their children. And\nin no case should they place before their children food which their\n412 Selected Messages Book 2\nreason teaches them is not conducive to health, but which would\nfever the system, and derange the digestive organs. Parents do not\nstudy from cause to effect in regard to their children, as in the case of\ntheir dumb animals and do not reason that to overwork, to eat after\nviolent exercise, and when much exhausted, and heated, will injure\nthe health of human beings, as well as the health of dumb animals,\nand will lay the foundation for a broken constitution in man, as well\nas the beasts.\nIf parents or children eat frequently, irregularly, and in too great\nquantities, even of the most healthful food, it will injure the consti-\ntution; but in addition to this, if the food is of an improper quality,\nand prepared with grease and indigestible spices, the result will be\nfar more injurious. The digestive organs will be severely taxed,\nand exhausted nature will be left a poor chance to rest, and recover\nstrength, and the vital organs soon become impaired, and break\ndown. If care and regularity is considered needful for dumb animals,\nit is as much more essential for human beings, formed in the image\nof their Maker, as they are of more value than the dumb creation.\nThe father in many cases, exercises less reason, and has less care,\nfor his wife, and their offspring, before its birth, than he manifests\nfor his cattle with young. The mother, in many cases previous to the\nbirth of her children, is permitted to toil early and late, heating her\nblood, while preparing various unhealthy dishes of food to suit the\nperverted taste of the family, and of visitors. Her strength should\nhave been tenderly cherished. A preparation of healthful food would\nhave required but about one-half of the expense and labor, and would\nhave been far more nourishing.\nThe mother, before the birth of her children, is often permitted\nto labor beyond her strength. Her burdens and cares are seldom\nlessened, and that period, which should be to her of all others, a time\nof rest, is one of fatigue, sadness, and gloom. By too great exertion\non her part, she deprives her offspring of that nutrition which nature\nhas provided for it, and by heating her blood, she imparts to it, a bad\nquality of blood. The offspring is robbed of its vitality, robbed of[428]\nphysical and mental strength. The father should study how to make\nthe mother happy. He should not allow himself to come to his home\nwith a clouded brow. If he is perplexed in business, he should not,\nunless it is actually necessary to counsel with his wife, trouble her\nChapter 2 413\nwith such matters. She has cares and trials of her own to bear, and\nshe should be tenderly spared every needless burden.\nThe mother too often meets with cold reserve from the father.\nIf everything does not move off just as pleasantly as he could wish,\nhe blames the wife and mother, and seems indifferent to her cares\nand daily trials. Men who do this, are working directly against\ntheir own interest and happiness. The mother becomes discouraged.\nHope and cheerfulness depart from her. She goes about her work\nmechanically, knowing that it must be done, which soon debilitates\nphysical and mental health. Children are born to them suffering with\nvarious diseases, and God holds the parents accountable in a great\ndegree; for it was their wrong habits which fastened disease upon\ntheir unborn children, under which they are compelled to suffer all\nthrough their lives. Some live but a short period with their load of\ndebility. The mother anxiously watches over the life of her child,\nand is weighed down with sorrow as she is compelled to close its\neyes in death, and she often regards God as the author of all this\naffliction, when the parents in reality were the murderers of their\nown child.\nThe father should bear in mind that the treatment of his wife\nbefore the birth of his offspring will materially affect the disposition\nof the mother during that period, and will have very much to do with\nthe character developed by the child after its birth. Many fathers have\nbeen so anxious to obtain property fast that higher considerations\nhave been sacrificed, and some men have been criminally neglectful\nof the mother and her offspring, and too frequently the lives of both\nhave been sacrificed to the strong desire to accumulate wealth. Many\ndo not immediately suffer this heavy penalty for their wrong doing,\nand are asleep as to the result of their course. The condition of\nthe wife is sometimes no better than that of a slave, and sometimes\nshe is equally guilty with the husband, of squandering physical\nstrength, to obtain means to live fashionably. It is a crime for such to\nhave children, for their offspring will often be deficient in physical,\nmental, and moral worth, and will bear the miserable, close, selfish [429]\nimpress of their parents, and the world will be cursed with their\nmeanness.\nIt is the duty of men and women to act with reason in regard to\ntheir labor. They should not exhaust their energies unnecessarily,\n414 Selected Messages Book 2\nfor by doing this, they not only bring suffering upon themselves but,\nby their errors, bring anxiety, weariness, and suffering upon those\nthey love. What calls for such an amount of labor? Intemperance\nin eating, and in drinking, and the desire for wealth have led to this\nintemperance in labor. If the appetite is controlled, and that food\nonly which is healthful be taken, there will be so great a saving of\nexpense, that men and women will not be compelled to labor beyond\ntheir strength, and thus violate the laws of health. The desire of men\nand women to accumulate property is not sinful if in their efforts\nto attain their object they do not forget God, and transgress the last\nsix precepts of Jehovah, which dictate the duty of man to his fellow\nman, and place themselves in a position where it is impossible for\nthem to glorify God in their bodies and spirits which are his. If\nin their haste to be rich they overtax their energies, and violate the\nlaws of their being, they place themselves in a condition where they\ncannot render to God perfect service, and are pursuing a course of\nsin. Property thus obtained is at an immense sacrifice.\nHard labor, and anxious care, often make the father nervous,\nimpatient, and exacting. He does not notice the tired look of his\nwife, who has labored with her feebler strength, just as hard as he\nhas labored, with his stronger energies. He suffers himself to be\nhurried with business, and through his anxiety to be rich, loses in a\ngreat measure the sense of his obligation to his family, and does not\nmeasure aright his wife\u2019s power of endurance. He often enlarges his\nfarm, requiring an increase of hired help, which necessarily increases\nthe housework. The wife realizes every day that she is doing too\nmuch work for her strength, yet she toils on thinking the work must\nbe done. She is continually reaching down into the future, drawing\nupon her future resources of strength and is living upon borrowed\ncapital, and at the period when she needs that strength, it is not at\nher command; and if she does not lose her life, her constitution is\nbroken, past recovery.\nIf the father would become acquainted with physical law, he\nmight better understand his obligations, and his responsibilities. He[430]\nwould see that he had been guilty of almost murdering his children,\nby suffering so many burdens to come upon the mother, compelling\nher to labor beyond her strength before their birth, in order to obtain\nmeans to leave for them. They nurse these children through their\nChapter 2 415\nsuffering life, and often lay them prematurely in the grave, little\nrealizing their wrong course has brought the sure result. How much\nbetter to have shielded the mother of his children from wearing labor,\nand mental anxiety, and let the children inherit good constitutions,\nand give them an opportunity to battle their way through life, not\nrelying upon their father\u2019s property, but upon their own energetic\nstrength. The experience thus obtained would be of more worth to\nthem than houses and lands, purchased at the expense of the health\nof mother and children.\nIt seems perfectly natural for some men to be morose, selfish,\nexacting, and overbearing. They have never learned the lesson of\nself-control, and will not restrain their unreasonable feelings, let the\nconsequences be what they may. Such men will be repaid, by seeing\ntheir companions sickly, and dispirited, and their children bearing\nthe peculiarities of their own disagreeable traits of character.\nIt is the duty of every married couple to studiously avoid marring\nthe feelings of each other. They should control every look, and\nexpression of fretfulness, and passion. They should study each\nothers\u2019 happiness, in small matters, as well as in large, manifesting\na tender thoughtfulness, in acknowledging kind acts, and the little\ncourtesies of each other. These small things should not be neglected,\nfor they are just as important to the happiness of man and wife, as\nfood is necessary to sustain physical strength. The father should\nencourage the wife and mother to lean upon his large affections.\nKind, cheerful, encouraging words from him, with whom she has\nentrusted her life-happiness, will be more beneficial to her than any\nmedicine; and the cheerful rays of light, such sympathising words\nwill bring to the heart of the wife and mother, will reflect back their\nown cheering beams upon the heart of the father.\nThe husband will frequently see his wife care-worn and debili-\ntated, growing prematurely old, in laboring to prepare food to suit\nthe vitiated taste. He gratifies the appetite, and will eat and drink\nthose things which cost much time and labor to prepare them for\nthe table, and which have a tendency to make those who partake of [431]\nthese unhealthy things, nervous and irritable. The wife and mother\nis seldom free from the headache, and the children are suffering\nthe effects of eating unwholesome food, and there is a great lack\nof patience and affection with parents and children. All are suffer-\n416 Selected Messages Book 2\ners together, for health has been sacrificed to lustful appetite. The\noffspring, before its birth, has transmitted to it disease, and an un-\nhealthy appetite. And the irritability, nervousness, and despondency,\nmanifested by the mother, will mark the character of her child.\nIn past generations, if mothers had informed themselves in regard\nto the laws of their being, they would have understood that their\nconstitutional strength, as well as the tone of their morals, and their\nmental faculties, would in a great measure be represented in their\noffspring. Their ignorance upon this subject, where so much is\ninvolved, is criminal. Many women never should have become\nmothers. Their blood was filled with scrofula, transmitted to them\nfrom their parents, and increased by their gross manner of living.\nThe intellect has been brought down, and enslaved to serve the\nanimal appetites, and children, born of such parents, have been poor\nsufferers, and of but little use to society.\nIt has been one of the greatest causes of degeneracy in gener-\nations back, up to the present time, that wives and mothers who\notherwise would have had a beneficial influence upon society, in\nraising the standard of morals, have been lost to society through\nmultiplicity of home cares, because of the fashionable, health-de-\nstroying manner of cooking, and also in consequence of too frequent\nchild-bearing. She has been compelled to needless suffering, her\nconstitution has failed, and her intellect has become weakened, by\nso great a draught upon her vital resources. Her offspring suffer\nher debility, and society has thrown upon them a class poorly fitted,\nthrough her inability to educate them, to be of the least benefit.\nIf these mothers had given birth to but few children, and if they\nhad been careful to live upon such food as would preserve physical\nhealth, and mental strength, so that the moral and intellectual might\npredominate over the animal, they could have so educated their\nchildren for usefulness, as to have been bright ornaments to society.\nIf parents in past generations had, with firmness of purpose, kept[432]\nthe body servant to the mind, and had not allowed the intellectual to\nbe enslaved by animal passions, there would be in this age a different\norder of beings upon the earth. And if the mother, before the birth of\nher offspring, had always possessed self-control, realizing that she\nwas giving the stamp of character to future generations, the present\nChapter 2 417\nstate of society would not be so depreciated in character as at the\npresent time.\nEvery woman, about to become a mother, whatever may be her\nsurroundings, should encourage constantly a happy, cheerful, con-\ntented, disposition, knowing that for all her efforts in this direction\nshe will be repaid ten-fold in the physical, as well as the moral\ncharacter of her offspring. Nor is this all. She can by habit accustom\nherself to cheerful thinking, and thus encourage a happy state of\nmind, and cast a cheerful reflection of her own happiness of spirit\nupon her family, and those with whom she associates. And in a very\ngreat degree will her physical health be improved. A force will be\nimparted to the life springs, the blood will not move sluggishly, as\nwould be the case if she were to yield to despondency, and gloom.\nHer mental and moral health are invigorated by the buoyancy of her\nspirits. The power of the will can resist impressions of the mind, and\nwill prove a grand soother of the nerves. Children who are robbed of\nthat vitality which they should have inherited of their parents should\nhave the utmost care. By close attention to the laws of their being, a\nmuch better condition of things can be established.\nThe period in which the infant receives its nourishment from\nthe mother, is critical. Many mothers, while nursing their infants,\nhave been permitted to over labor, and to heat their blood in cooking,\nand the nursling has been seriously affected, not only with fevered\nnourishment from the mother\u2019s breast, but its blood has been poi-\nsoned by the unhealthy diet of the mother, which has fevered her\nwhole system thereby affecting the food of the infant. The infant\nwill also be affected by the condition of the mother\u2019s mind. If she\nis unhappy, easily agitated, irritable, giving vent to outbursts of\npassion, the nourishment the infant receives from its mother, will\nbe inflamed, often producing colic, spasms, and, in some instances,\ncausing convulsions and fits.\nThe character also of the child is more or less affected by the [433]\nnature of the nourishment received from the mother. How important\nthen that the mother, while nursing her infant, should preserve a\nhappy state of mind, having the perfect control of her own spirit.\nBy thus doing, the food of the child is not injured, and the calm,\nself-possessed course the mother pursues in the treatment of her\nchild has very much to do in molding the mind of the infant. If it is\n418 Selected Messages Book 2\nnervous, and easily agitated, the mother\u2019s careful unhurried manner\nwill have a soothing and correcting influence, and the health of the\ninfant can be very much improved.\nInfants have been greatly abused by improper treatment. If it\nwas fretful, it has generally been fed to keep it quiet, when, in most\ncases, the very reason of its fretfulness was because of its having\nreceived too much food, made injurious by the wrong habits of the\nmother. More food only made the matter worse, for its stomach was\nalready overloaded.\nChildren are generally brought up from the cradle to indulge\nthe appetite, and are taught that they live to eat. The mother does\nmuch toward the formation of the character of her children in their\nchildhood. She can teach them to control the appetite, or she can\nteach them to indulge the appetite, and become gluttons. The mother\noften arranges her plans to accomplish a certain amount through\nthe day, and when the children trouble her, instead of taking time\nto soothe their little sorrows, and divert them, something is given\nthem to eat, to keep them still, which answers the purpose for a short\ntime, but eventually makes things worse. The children\u2019s stomachs\nare pressed with food when they had not the least want of food. All\nthat was required was a little of the mother\u2019s time and attention.\nBut she regarded her time altogether too precious to devote to the\namusement of her children. Perhaps the arrangement of her house in\na tasteful manner for visitors to praise, and to have her food cooked\nin a fashionable style, are with her higher considerations than the\nhappiness and health of her children.\nIntemperance in eating and in labor debilitates the parents, often\nmaking them nervous, and disqualifying them to rightly discharge\ntheir duty to their children. Three times a day parents and children\ngather around the table, loaded with a variety of fashionable foods.\nThe merits of each dish has to be tested. Perhaps the mother had\ntoiled till she was heated, and exhausted, and was not in a condition\nto take even the simplest food till she had first had a period of rest.[434]\nThe food she wearied herself in preparing was wholly unfit for her\nat any time, but especially taxes the digestive organs when the blood\nis heated and the system exhausted. Those who have thus persisted\nin violating the laws of their being, have been compelled to pay the\npenalty at some period in their life.\nChapter 2 419\nThere are ample reasons why there are so many nervous women\nin the world, complaining of the dyspepsia, with its train of evils.\nThe cause has been followed by the effect. It is impossible for\nintemperate persons to be patient. They must first reform bad habits,\nlearn to live healthfully, and then it will not be difficult for them to\nbe patient. Many do not seem to understand the relation the mind\nsustains to the body. If the system is deranged by improper food, the\nbrain and nerves are affected, and slight things annoy those who are\nthus afflicted. Little difficulties are to them troubles mountain high.\nPersons thus situated are unfitted to properly train their children.\nTheir life will be marked with extremes, sometimes very indulgent,\nat other times severe, censuring for trifles which deserved no notice.\nThe mother frequently sends her children from her presence,\nbecause she thinks she cannot endure the noise occasioned by their\nhappy frolics. But with no mother\u2019s eye over them to approbate,\nor disapprove, at the right time, unhappy differences often arise. A\nword from the mother would set all right again. They soon become\nweary, and desire change, and go into the street for amusement,\nand pure, innocent minded children are driven into bad company,\nand evil communications breathed into their ears corrupt their good\nmanners. The mother often seems to be asleep to the interest of\nher children until she is painfully aroused by the exhibition of vice.\nThe seeds of evil were sown in their young minds, promising an\nabundant harvest. And it is a marvel to her that her children are\nso prone to do wrong. Parents should begin in season to instil into\ninfant minds good and correct principles. The mother should be with\nher children as much as possible, and should sow precious seed in\ntheir hearts.\nThe mother\u2019s time belongs in a special manner to her children.\nThey have a right to her time as no others can have. In many cases\nmothers have neglected to discipline their children, because it would\nrequire too much of their time, which time they think must be spent [435]\nin the cooking department, or in preparing their own clothing, and\nthat of their children, according to fashion, to foster pride in their\nyoung hearts. In order to keep their restless children still, they have\ngiven them cake, or candies, almost any hour of the day, and their\nstomachs are crowded with hurtful things at irregular periods. Their\npale faces testify to the fact, that mothers are doing what they can to\n420 Selected Messages Book 2\ndestroy the remaining life forces of their poor children. The digestive\norgans are constantly taxed, and are not allowed periods of rest. The\nliver becomes inactive, the blood impure, and the children are sickly,\nand irritable, because they are real sufferers by intemperance, and it\nis impossible for them to exercise patience.\nParents wonder that children are so much more difficult to con-\ntrol than they used to be, when in most cases their own criminal\nmanagement has made them so. The quality of food they bring upon\ntheir tables, and encourage their children to eat, is constantly excit-\ning their animal passions, and weakening the moral and intellectual\nfaculties. Very many children are made miserable dyspeptics in their\nyouth by the wrong course their parents have pursued toward them\nin childhood. Parents will be called to render an account to God for\nthus dealing with their children.\nMany parents do not give their children lessons in self-control.\nThey indulge their appetite, and form the habits of their children in\ntheir childhood, to eat and drink, according to their desires. So will\nthey be in their general habits in their youth. Their desires have not\nbeen restrained, and as they grow older, they will not only indulge\nin the common habits of intemperance, but they will go still further\nin indulgences. They will choose their own associates, although\ncorrupt. They cannot endure restraint from their parents. They will\ngive loose rein to their corrupt passions, and have but little regard\nfor purity or virtue. This is the reason why there is so little purity\nand moral worth among the youth of the present day, and is the great\ncause why men and women feel under so little obligation to render\nobedience to the law of God. Some parents have not control over\nthemselves. They do not control their own morbid appetites, or their\npassionate tempers, therefore they cannot educate their children in\nregard to the denial of their appetite, and teach them self-control.\nMany mothers feel that they have not time to instruct their chil- [436]\ndren, and in order to get them out of the way, and get rid of their\nnoise and trouble, they send them to school. The school-room is a\nhard place for children who have inherited enfeebled constitutions.\nSchool-rooms generally have not been constructed in reference to\nhealth, but in regard to cheapness. The rooms have not been arranged\nso that they could be ventilated as they should have been without\nexposing the children to severe colds. And the seats have seldom\nChapter 2 421\nbeen made so that the children could sit with ease, and keep their\nlittle, growing frames in a proper posture to ensure healthy action\nof the lungs and heart. Young children can grow into almost any\nshape, and can, by habits of proper exercise and positions of the\nbody, obtain healthy forms. It is destructive to the health and life\nof young children for them to sit in the school-room, upon hard ill-\nformed benches, from three to five hours a day, inhaling the impure\nair caused by many breaths. The weak lungs become affected, the\nbrain, from which the nervous energy of the whole system is de-\nrived, becomes enfeebled by being called into active exercise before\nthe strength of the mental organs is sufficiently matured to endure\nfatigue.\nIn the school-room the foundation has been too surely laid for\ndiseases of various kinds. But, more especially, the most delicate\nof all organs, the brain, has often been permanently injured by too\ngreat exercise. This has often caused inflammation, then dropsy of\nthe head, and convulsions with their dreaded results. And the lives\nof many have been thus sacrificed by ambitious mothers. Of those\nchildren who have apparently had sufficient force of constitution to\nsurvive this treatment, there are very many who carry the effects of it\nthrough life. The nervous energy of the brain becomes so weakened,\nthat after they come to maturity, it is impossible for them to endure\nmuch mental exercise. The force of some of the delicate organs of\nthe brain seems to be expended.\nAnd not only has the physical and mental health of children\nbeen endangered by being sent to school at too early a period, but\nthey have been the losers in a moral point of view. They have\nhad opportunities to become acquainted with children who were\nuncultivated in their manners. They were thrown into the society\nof the coarse and rough, who lie, swear, steal, and deceive, and\nwho delight to impart their knowledge of vice to those younger than [437]\nthemselves. Young children if left to themselves learn the bad more\nreadily than the good. Bad habits agree best with the natural heart,\nand the things which they see and hear in infancy and childhood are\ndeeply imprinted upon their minds, and the bad seed sown in their\nyoung hearts will take root, and will become sharp thorns to wound\nthe hearts of their parents.\n422 Selected Messages Book 2\nDuring the first six or seven years of a child\u2019s life special attention\nshould be given to its physical training, rather than the intellect. After\nthis period, if the physical constitution is good, the education of both\nshould receive attention. Infancy extends to the age of six or seven\nyears. Up to this period, children should be left like little lambs, to\nroam around the house, and in the yards, in the buoyancy of their\nspirits, skipping and jumping free from care and trouble.\nParents, especially mothers, should be the only teachers of such\ninfant minds. They should not educate from books. The children\ngenerally will be inquisitive to learn the things of nature. They will\nask questions in regard to the things they see and hear, and parents\nshould improve the opportunity to instruct, and patiently answer,\nthese little inquiries. They can in this manner get the advantage of\nthe enemy, and fortify the minds of their children, by sowing good\nseed in their hearts, leaving no room for the bad to take root. The\nmother\u2019s loving instructions at a tender age is what is needed by\nchildren in the formation of character.\nThe first important lesson for children to learn is the proper\ndenial of appetite. It is the duty of mothers to attend to the wants\nof their children, by soothing and diverting their minds, instead of\ngiving them food, and thus teaching them that eating is the remedy\nfor life\u2019s ills.\nIf parents had lived healthfully, being satisfied with simple diet,\nmuch expense would have been saved. The father would not have\nbeen obliged to labor beyond his strength, in order to supply the\nwants of his family. A simple nourishing diet would not have had\nan influence to unduly excite the nervous system, and the animal\npassions, producing moroseness and irritability. If he had partaken\nonly of plain food, his head would have been clear, his nerves steady,\nhis stomach in a healthy condition, and with a pure system, he would\nhave had no loss of appetite, and the present generation would[438]\nbe in a much better condition than it now is. But even now, in\nthis late period, something can be done to improve our condition.\nTemperance in all things is necessary. A temperate father will not\ncomplain if he has no great variety upon his table. A healthful\nmanner of living will improve the condition of the family in every\nsense, and will allow the wife and mother time to devote to her\nchildren. The great study with the parents will be in what manner\nChapter 2 423\ncan they best train their children for usefulness in this world, and\nfor Heaven hereafter. They will be content to see their children with\nneat, plain, but comfortable garments free from embroidery and\nadornment. They will earnestly labor to see their children in the\npossession of the inward adorning, the ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\nBefore the Christian father leaves his home, to go to his labor,\nhe will gather his family around him, and bowing before God will\ncommit them to the care of the Chief Shepherd. He will then go\nforth to his labor with the love and blessing of his wife, and the love\nof his children, to make his heart cheerful through his laboring hours.\nAnd that mother who is aroused to her duty, realizes the obligations\nresting upon her to her children in the absence of the father. She\nwill feel that she lives for her husband and children. By training her\nchildren aright, teaching them habits of temperance and self-control,\nand in teaching them their duty to God, she is qualifying them to\nbecome useful in the world, to elevate the standard of morals in\nsociety, and to reverence and obey the law of God. Patiently and per-\nseveringly will the Godly mother instruct her children, giving them\nline upon line, and precept upon precept, not in a harsh, compelling\nmanner, but in love, and in tenderness will she win them. They will\nconsider her lessons of love, and will happily listen to her words of\ninstruction.\nInstead of sending her children from her presence, that she may\nnot be troubled with their noise, and be annoyed with the numerous\nattentions they would desire, she will feel that her time cannot be\nbetter employed than in soothing, and diverting their restless active\nminds with some amusement, or light, happy employment. The\nmother will be amply repaid for her efforts in taking time to invent\namusement for her children.\nYoung children love society. They cannot, as a general thing, [439]\nenjoy themselves alone, and the mother should feel that, in most\ncases, the place for her children, when they are in the house, is in the\nroom she occupies. She can then have a general oversight of them,\nand be prepared to set little differences right, when appealed to by\nthem, and correct wrong habits, or the manifestation of selfishness\nor passion, and can give their minds a turn in the right direction.\nThat which children enjoy, they think mother can be pleased with,\n424 Selected Messages Book 2\nand it is perfectly natural for them to consult mother in little matters\nof perplexity. And the mother should not wound the heart of her\nsensitive child by treating the matter with indifference, or by refusing\nto be troubled with such small matters. That which may be small to\nthe mother is large to them. And a word of direction, or caution, at\nthe right time, will often prove of great value. An approving glance,\na word of encouragement and praise from the mother, will often cast\na sunbeam into their young hearts for a whole day.\nThe first education children should receive from the mother in\ninfancy, should be in regard to their physical health. They should\nbe allowed only plain food, of that quality that would preserve to\nthem the best condition of health, and that should be partaken of\nonly at regular periods, not oftener than three times a day, and two\nmeals would be better than three. If children are disciplined aright,\nthey will soon learn that they can receive nothing by crying or\nfretting. A judicious mother will act in training her children, not\nmerely in regard to her own present comfort, but for their future\ngood. And to this end, she will teach her children the important\nlesson of controlling the appetite, and of self-denial, that they should\neat, drink, and dress in reference to health.\nA well-disciplined family, who love and obey God, will be cheer-\nful and happy. The father, when he returns from his daily labor, will\nnot bring his perplexities to his home. He will feel that home, and\nthe family circle, are too sacred to be marred with unhappy perplex-\nities. When he left his home, he did not leave his Saviour and his\nreligion behind. Both were his companions. The sweet influence of\nhis home, the blessing of his wife, and love of his children, make his\nburdens light, and he returns with peace in his heart, and cheerful\nencouraging words for his wife and children, who are waiting to\njoyfully welcome his coming. As he bows with his family, at the[440]\naltar of prayer, to offer up his grateful thanks to God, for his preserv-\ning care of himself and loved ones through the day, angels of God\nhover in the room, and bear the fervent prayers of God-fearing par-\nents to Heaven, as sweet incense, which are answered by returning\nblessings.\nParents should impress upon their children that it is sin to consult\nthe taste, to the injury of the stomach. They should impress upon\ntheir minds that by violating the laws of their being, they sin against\nChapter 2 425\ntheir Maker. Children thus educated will not be difficult of restraint.\nThey will not be subject to irritable, changeable tempers, and will be\nin a far better condition of enjoying life. Such children will the more\nreadily and clearly understand their moral obligations. Children who\nhave been taught to yield their will and wishes to their parents, will\nthe more easily and readily yield their wills to God, and will submit\nto be controlled by the Spirit of Christ. Why so many who claim to\nbe Christians, have numerous trials, which keep the church burdened,\nis because they have not been correctly trained in their childhood,\nand were left in a great measure to form their own character. Their\nwrong habits, and peculiar, unhappy dispositions, were not corrected.\nThey were not taught to yield their will to their parents. Their whole\nreligious experience is affected by their training in childhood. They\nwere not then controlled. They grew up undisciplined, and now,\nin their religious experience, it is difficult for them to yield to that\npure discipline taught in the word of God. Parents should, then,\nrealize the responsibility resting upon them to educate their children\nin reference to their religious experience.\nThose who regard the marriage relation as one of God\u2019s sacred\nordinances, guarded by his holy precept, will be controlled by the\ndictates of reason. They will consider carefully the result of ev-\nery privilege the marriage relation grants. Such will feel that their\nchildren are precious jewels committed to their keeping by God, to\nremove from their natures the rough surface by discipline, that their\nlustre may appear. They will feel under most solemn obligations to\nso form their characters that they may do good in their life, bless\nothers with their light, and the world be better for their having lived\nin it, and they be finally fitted for the higher life, the better world, to\nshine in the presence of God, and the Lamb forever.\u2014How to Live,\nNo. 2, 25-48.\nChapter 3[441]\nThe human family have brought upon themselves diseases of\nvarious forms by their own wrong habits. They have not studied how\nto live healthfully, and their transgression of the laws of their being\nhas produced a deplorable state of things. The people have seldom\naccredited their sufferings to the true cause\u2014their own wrong course\nof action. They have indulged an intemperance in eating, and made\na god of their appetite. In all their habits they have manifested a\nrecklessness in regard to health and life; and when, as the result,\nsickness has come upon them they have made themselves believe\nthat God was the author of it, when their own wrong course of action\nhas brought the sure result. When in distress they send for the doctor,\nand trust their bodies in his hands, expecting that he will make them\nwell. He deals out to them drugs, the nature of which they know\nnothing, and in their blind confidence they swallow anything that\nthe doctor may choose to give. Thus powerful poisons are often\nadministered which fetter nature in all her friendly efforts to recover\nthe abuse the system has suffered, and the patient is hurried out of\nthis life.\nThe mother who has been but slightly indisposed, and who might\nhave recovered by abstinence from food for a short period, and a\ncessation from labor, having quiet and rest, has, instead of doing\nthis, sent for a physician. And he who should be prepared to under-\nstandingly give a few simple directions, and restrictions in diet, and\nplace her upon the right track, is either too ignorant to do this, or too\nanxious to obtain a fee.\nHe makes the case a grave one, and administers his poisons,\nwhich, if he were sick, he would not venture to take himself. The\npatient grows worse, and poisonous drugs are more freely admin-\nistered, until nature is overpowered in her efforts, and gives up the\nconflict, and the mother dies. She was drugged to death. Her system[442]\nwas poisoned beyond remedy. She was murdered. Neighbors and\nrelatives marvel at the wonderful dealings of Providence in thus\n426\nChapter 3 427\nremoving a mother in the midst of her usefulness, at the period when\nher children need her care so much. They wrong our good and wise\nheavenly Father when they cast back upon him this weight of human\nwoe. Heaven wished that mother to live, and her untimely death\ndishonored God. The mother\u2019s wrong habits, and her inattention\nto the laws of her being, made her sick. And the doctor\u2019s fashion-\nable poisons, introduced into the system, closed the period of her\nexistence, and left a helpless, stricken, motherless flock.\nThe above is not always the result which follows the doctor\u2019s\ndrugging. Sick people who take these drug-poisons do appear to\nget well. With some, there is sufficient life-force for nature to draw\nupon, to so far expel the poison from the system that the sick, having\na period of rest, recover. But no credit should be allowed the drugs\ntaken, for they only hindered nature in her efforts. All the credit\nshould be ascribed to nature\u2019s restorative powers.\nAlthough the patient may recover, yet the powerful effort nature\nwas required to make to induce action to overcome the poison,\ninjured the constitution, and shortened the life of the patient. There\nare many who do not die under the influence of drugs, but there\nare very many who are left useless wrecks, hopeless, gloomy, and\nmiserable sufferers, a burden to themselves and to society.\nIf those who take these drugs were alone the sufferers, then the\nevil would not be as great. But parents not only sin against them-\nselves in swallowing drug-poisons, but they sin against their children.\nThe vitiated state of their blood, the poison distributed throughout\nthe system, the broken constitution, and various drug-diseases, as\nthe result of drug-poisons, are transmitted to their offspring, and left\nthem as a wretched inheritance, which is another great cause of the\ndegeneracy of the race.\nPhysicians, by administering their drug-poisons, have done very\nmuch to increase the depreciation of the race, physically, mentally,\nand morally. Everywhere you may go you will see deformity, disease\nand imbecility, which in very many cases can be traced directly back\nto the drug-poisons, administered by the hand of a doctor, as a\nremedy for some of life\u2019s ills. The so-called remedy has fearfully\nproved itself to the patient, by stern suffering experience, to be [443]\nfar worse than the disease for which the drug was taken. All who\npossess common capabilities should understand the wants of their\n428 Selected Messages Book 2\nown system. The philosophy of health should compose one of the\nimportant studies for our children. It is all-important that the human\norganism be understood, and then intelligent men and women can\nbe their own physicians. If the people would reason from cause\nto effect, and would follow the light which shines upon them, they\nwould pursue a course which would insure health, and mortality\nwould be far less. But the people are too willing to remain in\ninexcusable ignorance, and trust their bodies to the doctors, instead\nof having any special responsibility in the matter themselves.\nSeveral illustrations of this great subject have been presented\nbefore me. The first was a family consisting of a father and daughter.\nThe daughter was sick, and the father was much troubled on her\naccount, and summoned a physician. As the father conducted him\ninto the sick room, he manifested a painful anxiety. The physician\nexamined the patient, and said but little. They both left the sick room.\nThe father informed the physician that he had buried the mother, a\nson and daughter, and this daughter was all that was left to him of\nhis family. He anxiously inquired of the physician if he thought his\ndaughter\u2019s case hopeless.\nThe physician then inquired in regard to the nature and length\nof the sickness of those who had died. The father moanfully related\nthe painful facts connected with the illness of his loved ones. \u201cMy\nson was first attacked with a fever. I called a physician. He said\nthat he could administer medicine which would soon break the fever.\nHe gave him powerful medicine, but was disappointed in its effects.\nThe fever was reduced, but my son grew dangerously sick. The\nsame medicine was again given him, without producing any change\nfor the better. The physician then resorted to still more powerful\nmedicines, but my son obtained no relief. The fever left him, but he\ndid not rally. He sank rapidly and died.\n\u201cThe death of my son so sudden and unexpected was a great\ngrief to us all, but especially to his mother. Her watching and anxiety\nin his sickness, and her grief occasioned by his sudden death, were\ntoo much for her nervous system, and my wife was soon prostrated.[444]\nI felt dissatisfied with the course pursued by this physician. My\nconfidence in his skill was shaken, and I could not employ him a\nsecond time. I called another to my suffering wife. This second\nphysician gave her a liberal dose of opium, which he said would\nChapter 3 429\nrelieve her pains, quiet her nerves, and give her rest, which she much\nneeded. The opium stupefied her. She slept, and nothing could\narouse her from the death-like stupor. Her pulse and heart at times\nthrobbed violently, and then grew more and more feeble in their\naction, until she ceased to breathe. Thus she died without giving\nher family one look of recognition. This second death seemed more\nthan we could endure. We all sorrowed deeply but I was agonized\nand could not be comforted.\n\u201cMy daughter was next afflicted. Grief, anxiety and watching,\nhad overtasked her powers of endurance, and her strength gave way,\nand she was brought upon a bed of suffering. I have now lost\nconfidence in both the physicians I had employed. Another physician\nwas recommended to me as being successful in treating the sick.\nAnd although he lived at a distance, I was determined to obtain his\nservices.\n\u201cThis third physician professed to understand my daughter\u2019s\ncase. He said that she was greatly debilitated, and that her nervous\nsystem was deranged, and that fever was upon her, which could\nbe controlled, but that it would take time to bring her up from her\npresent state of debility. He expressed perfect confidence in his\nability to raise her. He gave her powerful medicine to break up\nthe fever. This was accomplished. But as the fever left, the case\nassumed more alarming features, and grew more complicated. As\nthe symptoms changed, the medicines were varied to meet the case.\nWhile under the influence of new medicines she would, for a time,\nappear revived, which would flatter our hopes, that she would get\nwell, only to make our disappointment more bitter as she became\nworse.\n\u201cThe physician\u2019s last resort was calomel. For some time she\nseemed to be between life and death. She was thrown into convul-\nsions. As these most distressing spasms ceased, we were aroused to\nthe painful fact that her intellect was weakened. She began slowly to\nimprove, although still a great sufferer. Her limbs were crippled as\nthe effect of the powerful poisons which she had taken. She lingered\na few years a helpless, pitiful sufferer, and died in much agony.\u201d\nAfter this sad relation the father looked imploringly to the physi- [445]\ncian, and entreated him to save his only remaining child. The physi-\n430 Selected Messages Book 2\ncian looked sad and anxious, but made no prescription. He arose to\nleave, saying that he would call the next day.\nAnother scene was then presented before me. I was brought into\nthe presence of a female, apparently about thirty years of age. A\nphysician was standing by her, and reporting, that her nervous system\nwas deranged, that her blood was impure, and moved sluggishly,\nand that her stomach was in a cold, inactive condition. He said that\nhe would give her active remedies which would soon improve her\ncondition. He gave her a powder from a vial upon which was written,\nNux V omica. I watched to see what effect this would have upon the\npatient. It appeared to act favorably. Her condition seemed better.\nShe was animated, and even seemed cheerful and active.\nMy attention was then called to still another case. I was intro-\nduced into the sick room of a young man who was in a high fever. A\nphysician was standing by the bedside of the sufferer with a portion\nof medicine taken from a vial upon which was written Calomel. He\nadministered this chemical poison, and a change seemed to take\nplace, but not for the better.\nI was then shown still another case. It was that of a female, who\nseemed to be suffering much pain. A physician stood by the bedside\nof the patient, and was administering medicine, taken from a vial,\nupon which was written, Opium. At first this drug seemed to affect\nthe mind. She talked strangely, but finally became quiet and slept.\nMy attention was then called to the first case, that of the father\nwho had lost his wife and two children. The physician was in the\nsick room, standing by the bedside of the afflicted daughter. Again\nhe left the room without giving medicine. The father, when in\nthe presence of the physician alone seemed deeply moved, and he\ninquired impatiently, \u201cDo you intend to do nothing? Will you leave\nmy only daughter to die?\u201d The physician said,\u2014\n\u201cI have listened to the sad history of the death of your much loved\nwife, and your two children, and have learned from your own lips\nthat all three have died while in the care of physicians, while taking\nmedicines prescribed and administered by their hands. Medicine\nhas not saved your loved ones, and as a physician I solemnly believe[446]\nthat none of them need, or ought to have died. They could have\nrecovered if they had not been so drugged that nature was enfeebled\nby abuse, and finally crushed.\u201d He stated decidedly to the agitated\nChapter 3 431\nfather \u201cI cannot give medicine to your daughter. I shall only seek\nto assist nature in her efforts, by removing every obstruction, and\nthen leave nature to recover the exhausted energies of the system.\u201d\nHe placed in the father\u2019s hand a few directions which he enjoined\nupon him to follow closely.\n\u201cKeep the patient free from excitement, and every influence\ncalculated to depress. Her attendants should be cheerful and hopeful.\nShe should have a simple diet, and should be allowed plenty of pure\nsoft water to drink. Bathe frequently in pure soft water followed by\ngentle rubbing. Let the light, and air, be freely admitted into her\nroom. She must have quiet, and undisturbed rest.\u201d\nThe father slowly read the prescription, and wondered at the few\nsimple directions it contained, and seemed doubtful of any good\nresulting from such simple means. Said the physician,\n\u201cYou have had sufficient confidence in my skill to place the life\nof your daughter in my hands. Withdraw not your confidence. I\nwill visit your daughter daily, and direct you in the management of\nher case. Follow my directions with confidence, and I trust in a few\nweeks to present her to you in a much better condition of health, if\nnot fully restored.\u201d\nThe father looked sad and doubtful, but submitted to the decision\nof the physician. He feared that his daughter must die if she had no\nmedicine.\nThe second case was again presented before me. The patient\nhad appeared better under the influence of nux vomica. She was\nsitting up, folding a shawl closely around her, and complaining of\nchilliness. The air in the room was impure. It was heated and had\nlost its vitality. Almost every crevice where the pure air could enter\nwas guarded to protect the patient from a sense of painful chilliness,\nwhich was especially felt in the back of the neck and down the\nspinal column. If the door was left ajar, she seemed nervous and\ndistressed, and entreated that it should be closed, for she was cold.\nShe could not bear the least draught of air from the door or windows.\nA gentleman of intelligence stood looking pityingly upon her, and [447]\nsaid to those present,\u2014\n\u201cThis is the second result of nux vomica. It is especially felt\nupon the nerves, and it affects the whole nervous system. There will\nbe, for a time, increased forced action upon the nerves. But as the\n432 Selected Messages Book 2\nstrength of this drug is spent, there will be chilliness, and prostration.\nJust to that degree that it excites and enlivens, will be the deadening,\nbenumbing results following.\u201d\nThe third case was again presented before me. It was that of\nthe young man to whom was administered calomel. He was a great\nsufferer. His lips were dark and swollen. His gums were inflamed.\nHis tongue was thick and swollen, and the saliva was running from\nhis mouth in large quantities. The intelligent gentleman before\nmentioned looked sadly upon the sufferer, and said,\u2014\n\u201cThis is the influence of mercurial preparations. This young man\nhad remaining, sufficient nervous energy, to commence a warfare\nupon this intruder, this drug-poison to attempt to expel it from the\nsystem. Many have not sufficient life-forces left to arouse to action,\nand nature is overpowered and ceases her efforts, and the victim\ndies.\u201d\nThe fourth case, the person to whom was given opium, was\nagain presented before me. She had awakened from her sleep much\nprostrated. Her mind was distracted. She was impatient and irritable,\nfinding fault with her best friends, and imagining that they did not\ntry to relieve her sufferings. She became frantic, and raved like a\nmaniac. The gentleman before mentioned looked sadly upon the\nsufferer, and said to those present,\u2014\n\u201cThis is the second result from taking opium.\u201d Her physician was\ncalled. He gave her an increased dose of opium which quieted her\nravings, yet made her very talkative and cheerful. She was at peace\nwith all around her, and expressed much affection for acquaintances,\nas well as her relatives. She soon grew drowsy and fell into a\nstupefied condition. The gentleman mentioned above, solemnly\nsaid,\u2014\n\u201cHer conditions of health are no better now than when she was in\nher frantic ravings. She is decidedly worse. This drug-poison, opium,\ngives temporary relief from pain, but does not remove the cause of\npain. It only stupefies the brain, rendering it incapable of receiving\nimpressions from the nerves. While the brain is thus insensible,\nthe hearing, the taste, and sight are affected. When the influence of[448]\nopium wears off, and the brain arouses from its state of paralysis, the\nnerves, which had been cut off from communication with the brain,\nshriek out louder than ever the pains in the system, because of the\nChapter 3 433\nadditional outrage the system has sustained in receiving this poison.\nEvery additional drug given to the patient, whether it be opium, or\nsome other poison, will complicate the case, and make the patient\u2019s\nrecovery more hopeless. The drugs given to stupefy, whatever\nthey may be, derange the nervous system. An evil, simple in the\nbeginning, which nature aroused herself to overcome, and which\nshe would have done had she been left to herself, has been made\nten-fold worse by drug-poisons being introduced into the system,\nwhich is a destructive disease of itself, forcing into extraordinary\naction the remaining life-forces to war against and overcome the\ndrug-intruder.\u201d\nI was brought again into the sick room of the first case, that of\nthe father and his daughter. The daughter was sitting by the side\nof her father, cheerful and happy, with the glow of health upon her\ncountenance. The father was looking upon her with happy satis-\nfaction, his countenance speaking the gratitude of his heart, that\nhis only child was spared to him. Her physician entered, and after\nconversing with the father and child for a short time, arose to leave.\nHe addressed the father, thus,\u2014\n\u201cI present to you your daughter restored to health. I gave her\nno medicine that I might leave her with an unbroken constitution.\nMedicine never could have accomplished this. Medicine deranges\nnature\u2019s fine machinery, and breaks down the constitution, and kills,\nbut never cures. Nature alone possesses the restorative powers. She\nalone can build up her exhausted energies, and repair the injuries\nshe has received by inattention to her fixed laws.\u201d\nHe then asked the father if he was satisfied with his manner of\ntreatment. The happy father expressed his heartfelt gratitude, and\nperfect satisfaction, saying,\u2014\n\u201cI have learned a lesson I shall never forget. It was painful, yet it\nis of priceless value. I am now convinced that my wife and children\nneed not have died. Their lives were sacrificed while in the hands of\nphysicians by their poisonous drugs.\u201d\nI was then shown the second case, the patient to whom nux [449]\nvomica had been administered. She was being supported by two\nattendants, from her chair to her bed. She had nearly lost the use\nof her limbs. The spinal nerves were partially paralyzed, and the\nlimbs had lost their power to bear the weight of the person. She\n434 Selected Messages Book 2\ncoughed distressingly, and breathed with difficulty. She was laid\nupon the bed, and soon lost her hearing, and seeing, and thus she\nlingered awhile, and died. The gentleman before mentioned looked\nsorrowfully upon the lifeless body, and said to those present,\u2014\n\u201cWitness the mildest and protracted influence of nux vomica\nupon the human system. At its introduction, the nervous energy was\nexcited to extraordinary action to meet this drug-poison. This extra\nexcitement was followed by prostration, and the final result has been\nparalysis of the nerves. This drug does not have the same effect upon\nall. Some who have powerful constitutions can recover from abuses\nto which they may subject the system. While others, whose hold\nof life is not as strong, who possess enfeebled constitutions, have\nnever recovered from receiving into the system even one dose, and\nmany die from no other cause than the effects of one portion of this\npoison. Its effects are always tending to death. The condition the\nsystem is in, at the time these poisons are received into it, determine\nthe life of the patient. Nux vomica can cripple, paralyze, destroy\nhealth forever, but it never cures.\u201d\nThe third case was again presented before me, that of the young\nman to whom had been administered calomel. He was a pitiful\nsufferer. His limbs were crippled, and he was greatly deformed.\nHe stated that his sufferings were beyond description, and life was\nto him a great burden. The gentleman whom I have repeatedly\nmentioned, looked upon the sufferer with sadness and pity, and\nsaid,\u2014\n\u201cThis is the effect of calomel. It torments the system as long as\nthere is a particle left in it. It ever lives, not losing its properties by\nits long stay in the living system. It inflames the joints, and often\nsends rottenness into the bones. It frequently manifests itself in\ntumors, ulcers, and cancers, years after it has been introduced into\nthe system.\u201d\nThe fourth case was again presented before me\u2014the patient to\nwhom opium had been administered. Her countenance was sallow,\nand her eyes were restless and glassy. Her hands shook as if palsied,\nand she seemed to be greatly excited, imagining that all present were[450]\nleagued against her. Her mind was a complete wreck, and she raved\nin a pitiful manner. The physician was summoned, and seemed to\nbe unmoved at these terrible exhibitions. He gave the patient a more\nChapter 3 435\npowerful portion of opium, which he said would set her all right.\nHer ravings did not cease until she became thoroughly intoxicated.\nShe then passed into a deathlike stupor. The gentleman mentioned,\nlooked upon the patient and said sadly,\u2014\n\u201cHer days are numbered. The efforts nature has made have been\nso many times overpowered by this poison, that the vital forces are\nexhausted by being repeatedly induced to unnatural action to rid the\nsystem of this poisonous drug. Nature\u2019s efforts are about to cease,\nand then the patient\u2019s suffering life will end.\u201d\nMore deaths have been caused by drug-taking than from all\nother causes combined. If there was in the land one physician in the\nplace of thousands, a vast amount of premature mortality would be\nprevented. Multitudes of physicians, and multitudes of drugs, have\ncursed the inhabitants of the earth, and have carried thousands and\ntens of thousands to untimely graves.\nIndulging in eating too frequently, and in too large quantities,\novertaxes the digestive organs, and produces a feverish state of the\nsystem. The blood becomes impure, and then diseases of various\nkinds occur. A physician is sent for, who prescribes some drug\nwhich gives present relief, but which does not cure the disease. It\nmay change the form of disease, but the real evil is increased tenfold.\nNature was doing her best to rid the system of an accumulation of\nimpurities, and, could she have been left to herself, aided by the\ncommon blessings of Heaven, such as pure air and pure water, a\nspeedy and safe cure would have been effected.\nThe sufferers, in such cases, can do for themselves that which\nothers cannot do as well for them. They should commence to re-\nlieve nature of the load they have forced upon her. They should\nremove the cause. Fast a short time, and give the stomach chance\nfor rest. Reduce the feverish state of the system by a careful and\nunderstanding application of water. These efforts will help nature in\nher struggles to free the system of impurities. But generally the per-\nsons who suffer pain become impatient. They are not willing to use [451]\nself-denial, and suffer a little from hunger. Neither are they willing\nto wait the slow process of nature to build up the overtaxed energies\nof the system. But they are determined to obtain relief at once, and\ntake powerful drugs, prescribed by physicians. Nature was doing\nher work well, and would have triumphed, but while accomplishing\n436 Selected Messages Book 2\nher task, a foreign substance of a poisonous nature was introduced.\nWhat a mistake! Abused nature has now two evils to war against\ninstead of one. She leaves the work in which she was engaged, and\nresolutely takes hold to expel the intruder newly introduced into the\nsystem. Nature feels this double draft upon her resources, and she\nbecomes enfeebled.\nDrugs never cure disease. They only change the form and lo-\ncation. Nature alone is the effectual restorer, and how much better\ncould she perform her task if left to herself. But this privilege is\nseldom allowed her. If crippled nature bears up under the load, and\nfinally accomplishes in a great measure her double task, and the\npatient lives, the credit is given to the physician. But if nature fails in\nher effort to expel the poison from the system, and the patient dies, it\nis called a wonderful dispensation of Providence. If the patient had\ntaken a course to relieve overburdened nature in season, and under-\nstandingly used pure soft water, this dispensation of drug-mortality\nmight have been wholly averted. The use of water can accomplish\nbut little, if the patient does not feel the necessity of also strictly\nattending to his diet.\nMany are living in violation of the laws of health, and are ig-\nnorant of the relation their habits of eating, drinking, and working,\nsustain to their health. They will not arouse to their true condition,\nuntil nature protests against the abuses she is suffering, by aches\nand pains in the system. If, even then, the sufferers would only\ncommence the work right, and would resort to the simple means\nthey have neglected\u2014the use of water and proper diet, nature would\nhave just the help she requires, and which she ought to have had long\nbefore. If this course is pursued, the patient will generally recover\nwithout being debilitated.\nWhen drugs are introduced into the system, for a time they may\nseem to have a beneficial effect. A change may take place, but the\ndisease is not cured. It will manifest itself in some other form. In\nnature\u2019s efforts to expel the drug from the system, intense suffering is[452]\nsometimes caused the patient. And the disease, which the drug was\ngiven to cure, may disappear, but only to re-appear in a new form,\nsuch as skin diseases, ulcers, painful diseased joints, and sometimes\nin a more dangerous and deadly form. The liver, heart, and brain, are\nfrequently affected by drugs, and often all these organs are burdened\nChapter 3 437\nwith disease, and the unfortunate subjects, if they live, are invalids\nfor life, wearily dragging out a miserable existence. Oh, how much\nthat poisonous drug cost! If it did not cost the life, it cost quite\ntoo much. Nature has been crippled in all her efforts. The whole\nmachinery is out of order, and at a future period in life, when these\nfine works which have been injured, are to be relied upon to act\na more important part in union with all the fine works of nature\u2019s\nmachinery, they cannot readily and strongly perform their labor, and\nthe whole system feels the lack. These organs, which should be in a\nhealthy condition, are enfeebled, the blood becomes impure. Nature\nkeeps struggling, and the patient suffers with different ailments, until\nthere is a sudden breaking down in her efforts, and death follows.\nThere are more who die from the use of drugs, than all who would\nhave died of disease had nature been left to do her own work.\nVery many lives have been sacrificed by physicians\u2019 administer-\ning drugs for unknown diseases. They have no real knowledge of the\nexact disease which afflicts the patient. But physicians are expected\nto know in a moment what to do, and unless they act at once as\nthough they understood the disease perfectly, they are considered\nby impatient friends, and by the sick, as incompetent physicians.\nTherefore, to gratify erroneous opinions of the sick and their friends,\nmedicine must be administered, experiments and tests tried, to cure\nthe patient of the disease of which they have no real knowledge.\nNature is loaded with poisonous drugs which she cannot expel from\nthe system. The physicians themselves are often convinced that they\nhave used powerful medicines for a disease which did not exist, and\ndeath was the consequence.\nPhysicians are censurable, but they are not the only ones at fault.\nThe sick themselves, if they would be patient, diet and suffer a little,\nand give nature time to rally, would recover much sooner without\nthe use of any medicine. Nature alone possesses curative powers.\nMedicines have no power to cure, but will most generally hinder [453]\nnature in her efforts. She, after all, must do the work of restoring.\nThe sick are in a hurry to get well, and the friends of the sick are\nimpatient. They will have medicine, and if they do not feel that\npowerful influence upon their systems their erroneous views lead\nthem to think they should feel, they impatiently change for another\nphysician. The change often increases the evil. They go through a\n438 Selected Messages Book 2\ncourse of medicine equally as dangerous as the first, and more fatal,\nbecause the two treatments do not agree, and the system is poisoned\nbeyond remedy.\nBut many have never experienced the beneficial effects of water,\nand are afraid to use one of Heaven\u2019s greatest blessings. Water has\nbeen refused persons suffering with burning fevers, through fear that\nit would injure them. If, in their fevered state, water had been given\nthem to drink freely, and applications had also been made externally,\nlong days and nights of suffering would have been saved, and many\nprecious lives spared. But thousands have died with raging fevers\nconsuming them, until the fuel which fed the fever was burnt up, the\nvitals consumed, and have died in the greatest agony, without being\npermitted to have water to allay their burning thirst. Water, which is\nallowed a senseless building to put out the raging elements, is not\nallowed human beings to put out the fire which is consuming the\nvitals.\nMultitudes remain in inexcusable ignorance in regard to the laws\nof their being. They are wondering why our race is so feeble, and\nwhy so many die prematurely. Is there not a cause? Physicians\nwho profess to understand the human organism, prescribe for their\npatients, and even for their own dear children, and their companions,\nslow poisons to break up disease, or to cure slight indisposition.\nSurely, they cannot realize the evil of these things or they could\nnot do thus. The effects of the poison may not be immediately\nperceived, but it is doing its work surely in the system, undermining\nthe constitution, and crippling nature in her efforts. They are seeking\nto correct an evil, but produce a far greater one, which is often\nincurable. Those who are thus dealt with, are constantly sick, and\nconstantly dosing. And yet, if you listen to their conversation, you\nwill often hear them praising the drugs they have been using, and\nrecommending their use to others, because they have been benefited[454]\nby their use. It would seem that to such as can reason from cause to\neffect, the sallow countenance, the continual complaints of ailments,\nand general prostration of those who claim to be benefited, would\nbe sufficient proofs of the health-destroying influence of drugs. And\nyet many are so blinded they do not see that all the drugs they have\ntaken have not cured them, but made them worse. The drug invalid\nnumbers one in the world, but is generally peevish, irritable, always\nChapter 3 439\nsick, lingering out a miserable existence, and seems to live only to\ncall into constant exercise the patience of others. Poisonous drugs\nhave not killed them outright, for nature is loth to give up her hold\non life. She is unwilling to cease her struggles. Yet these drug-takers\nare never well.\nThe endless variety of medicines in the market, the numerous\nadvertisements of new drugs and mixtures, all of which, as they say,\ndo wonderful cures, kill hundreds where they benefit one. Those\nwho are sick are not patient. They will take the various medicines,\nsome of which are very powerful, although they know nothing of the\nnature of the mixtures. All the medicines they take only make their\nrecovery more hopeless. Yet they keep dosing, and continue to grow\nworse until they die. Some will have medicine at all events. Then\nlet them take these hurtful mixtures, and the various deadly poisons,\nupon their own responsibility. God\u2019s servants should not administer\nmedicines which they know will leave behind injurious effects upon\nthe system, even if they do relieve present suffering.\u2014How to Live,\nNo. 3, 49-64.\nChapter 4[455]\nWhen severe sickness enters a family, there is great need of\neach member giving strict attention to personal cleanliness, and\ndiet, to preserve themselves in a healthful condition, and by thus\ndoing, fortify themselves against disease. It is also of the greatest\nimportance that the sick-room, from the first, be properly ventilated.\nThis will be beneficial to the afflicted, and highly necessary to keep\nthose well who are compelled to remain a length of time in the\nsick-room.\nIt is of great value to the sick to have an even temperature in\nthe room. This cannot always be correctly determined, if left to\nthe judgment of attendants, for they may not be the best judges\nof a right temperature. And some persons require more heat than\nothers, and would be only comfortable in a room which to another\nwould be uncomfortably warm. And if each of these are at liberty to\narrange the fires, to suit their ideas of proper heat, the atmosphere\nin the sick-room will be anything but regular. Sometimes it will be\ndistressingly warm for the patient; at another time too cold, which\nwill have a most injurious effect upon the sick. The friends of the\nsick, or attendants, who through anxiety, and watching, are deprived\nof sleep, and who are suddenly awakened in the night from sleep to\nattend in the sick-room, are liable to chilliness. Such are not correct\nthermometers of the healthful temperature of a sick-room. These\nthings may appear of small account, but they have very much to do\nwith the recovery of the sick. In many instances life has been periled\nby extreme changes of the temperature of the sick-room.\nIn pleasant weather the sick in no case should be deprived of\na full supply of fresh air. Their rooms may not always be so con-\nstructed as to allow the windows or doors open in their rooms,\nwithout the draught coming directly upon them, and exposing them[456]\nto take cold. In such cases windows and doors should be opened in\nan adjoining room, and thus let the fresh air enter the room occupied\nby the sick. Fresh air will prove more beneficial to the sick than\n440\nChapter 4 441\nmedicine, and is far more essential to them than their food. They\nwill do better, and recover sooner, deprived of food, than of fresh air.\nMany invalids have been confined weeks and months in close\nrooms, shutting out the light, and pure, invigorating air of heaven,\nas though air was a deadly enemy, when it was just the medicine the\nsick needed to make them well. The whole system was debilitated\nand diseased for want of air, and nature was sinking under her load\nof accumulating impurities, in addition to the fashionable poisons\nadministered by physicians, until she was overpowered, and broke\ndown in her efforts, and the sick died. They might have lived. Heaven\nwilled not their death. They died victims to their own ignorance, and\nthat of their friends, and the ignorance and deception of physicians,\nwho gave them fashionable poisons, and would not allow them pure\nwater to drink, and fresh air to breathe, to invigorate the vital organs,\npurify the blood, and help nature in her task in overcoming the bad\nconditions of the system. These valuable remedies which Heaven\nhas provided, without money and without price, were cast aside, and\nconsidered not only as worthless, but even as dangerous enemies,\nwhile poisons, prescribed by physicians, were in blind confidence\ntaken.\nThousands have died for want of pure water, and pure air, who\nmight have lived. And thousands of living invalids, who are a\nburden to themselves and others, think that their lives depend upon\ntaking medicines from the doctors. They are continually guarding\nthemselves against the air, and avoiding the use of water. These\nblessings they need in order to become well. If they would become\nenlightened, and let medicine alone, and accustom themselves to\noutdoor exercise, and to air in their houses, summer and winter, and\nuse soft water for drinking and bathing purposes, they would be\ncomparatively well and happy, instead of dragging out a miserable\nexistence.\nIt is the duty of attendants and nurses in the sick-room to have a\nspecial care of their own health, especially in critical cases of fever\nand consumption. One person should not be kept closely confined\nto the sick-room. It is safer to have two or three to depend upon, [457]\nwho are careful and understanding nurses, and these changing and\nsharing the care and confinement of the sick-room. Each should\nhave exercise in the open air, as often as possible. This is important\n442 Selected Messages Book 2\nto sick-bed attendants, especially if the friends of the sick are among\nthat class who continue to regard air, if admitted into the sick-room,\nas an enemy, and will not allow the windows raised, or the doors\nopened. The sick, and the attendants, are in this case compelled to\nbreathe the poisonous atmosphere from day to day, because of the\ninexcusable ignorance of the friends of the sick.\nIn very many cases the attendants are ignorant of the wants of\nthe system, and the relation which the breathing of fresh air sustains\nto health, and the life-destroying influence of inhaling the diseased\nair of a sick-room. In this case the life of the sick is endangered,\nand the attendants themselves are liable to take on diseases, and lose\nhealth, and perhaps life.\nIf fevers enter a family, often more than one have the same fever.\nThis need not be, if the habits of the family are correct. If their diet\nis as it should be, and they observe habits of cleanliness, and realize\nthe necessity of ventilation, the fever need not extend to another\nmember of the family. The reason of fevers prevailing in families,\nand exposing the attendants, is because the sick-room is not kept\nfree from poisonous infection, by cleanliness and proper ventilation.\nIf attendants are awake to the subject of health, and realize the\nnecessity of ventilation for their own benefit, as well as that of the\npatient, and the relatives, as well as the sick, oppose the admission\nof air and light into the sick-room, the attendants should have no\nscruples of conscience in leaving the sick-room. They should feel\nthemselves released from their obligations to the sick. It is not the\nduty of one or more to risk the liability of incurring disease, and\nendangering their lives by breathing a poisonous atmosphere. If the\nsick will fall a victim to their own erroneous ideas, and will shut out\nof the room the most essential of Heaven\u2019s blessings, let them do so,\nbut not at the peril of those who ought to live.\nThe mother, from a sense of duty, has left her family to adminis-\nter in the sick room, where pure air was not allowed to enter, and has\nbecome sick by inhaling the diseased atmosphere, which affected[458]\nher whole system. After a period of much suffering, she has died\nleaving her children motherless. The sick, who shared the sympathy\nand unselfish care of this mother, recovered, but neither the sick, nor\nthe friends of the sick, understood that precious life was sacrificed\nbecause of their ignorance of the relation which pure air sustains to\nChapter 4 443\nhealth. Neither did they feel responsibility in regard to the stricken\nflock, left without the tender mother\u2019s care.\nMothers sometimes permit their daughters to take care of the\nsick in illy ventilated rooms, and, as a result, have had to nurse them\nthrough a period of sickness. And because of the mother\u2019s anxiety\nand care for her child, she has been made sick, and frequently one\nor both have died, or been left with broken constitutions, or made\nsuffering invalids for life. There is a lamentable catalogue of evils\nwhich have their origin in the sick room, from which the pure air\nof heaven is excluded. All who breathe this poisonous atmosphere\nviolate the laws of their being, and must suffer the penalty.\nThe sick, as a general thing, are taxed with too many visitors and\ncallers, who chat with them, and weary them by introducing different\ntopics of conversation, when they need quiet, and undisturbed rest.\nMany have made themselves sick by overtaxing their strength. Their\nexhausted energies compel them to cease labor, and they are brought\nto a bed of suffering. Rest, freedom from care, light, pure air, pure\nwater, and spare diet, are all that they need to make them well. It\nis mistaken kindness that leads so many, out of courtesy, to visit\nthe sick. Often have they spent a sleepless, suffering night, after\nreceiving visitors. They have been more or less excited, and the\nreaction has been too great for their already debilitated energies,\nand, as the result of these fashionable calls, they have been brought\ninto very dangerous conditions, and lives have been sacrificed for\nthe want of thoughtful prudence.\nIt is sometimes gratifying to the sick to be visited, and to know\nthat friends have not forgotten them in their affliction. But, although\nthese visits may have been gratifying, in very many instances these\nfashionable calls have turned the scale when the invalid was recov-\nering, and the balance has borne down to death. Those who cannot\nmake themselves useful should be cautious in regard to visiting\nthe sick. If they can do no good, they may do harm. But the sick [459]\nshould not be neglected. They should have the best of care, and the\nsympathy of friends and relatives.\nMuch harm has resulted to the sick from the universal custom\nof having watchers, nights. In critical cases this may be necessary;\nbut it is often the case that more harm is done the sick by this\npractice than good. It has been the custom to shut out the air from\n444 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe sick room. The atmosphere of such rooms, to say the least, is\nvery impure, which greatly aggravates the condition of the sick. In\naddition to this, to have one or two watchers to use up the little vital\nair which may find its way to the sick room through the crevices of\ndoors and windows, is taking from them this vitality, and leaving\nthem more debilitated than they would have been had they been left\nto themselves. The evil does not end here. Even one watcher will\nmake more or less stir, which disturbs the sick. But where there are\ntwo watchers, they often converse together, sometimes aloud, but\nmore frequently in whispered tones, which is far more trying and\nexciting to the nerves of the sick than talking aloud.\nMany suffering wakeful nights are endured by the sick because\nof watchers. If they were left alone without a light, knowing that all\nwere at rest, they could much better compose themselves to sleep,\nand in the morning they would awake refreshed. Every breath of\nvital air in the sick room is of the greatest value, although many\nof the sick are very ignorant on this point. They feel very much\ndepressed, and do not know what the matter is. A draught of pure\nair through their room would have a happy invigorating influence\nupon them.\nBut if they are afraid of air, and shut themselves away from\nthis blessing, the little that is allowed to reach them should not be\nconsumed by watchers, or lamp-light. Attendants upon the sick\nshould if possible leave them to quiet and rest through the night,\nwhile they occupy a room adjoining.\nAll unnecessary noise and excitement should be avoided in the\nsick room, and the whole house should be kept as quiet as possible.\nIgnorance, forgetfulness, and recklessness, have caused the death\nof many who might have lived, had they received proper care from\njudicious, thoughtful attendants. The doors should be opened and\nshut with great care, and the attendants should be unhurried, calm,[460]\nand self-possessed.\nThe sick room, if possible, should have a draught of air through\nit, day and night. The draught should not come directly upon the\ninvalid. While burning fevers are raging, there is but little danger of\ntaking cold. But especial care is needful when the crisis comes, and\nfever is passing away. Then constant watching may be necessary to\nkeep vitality in the system. The sick must have pure, invigorating\nChapter 4 445\nair. If no other way can be devised, the sick, if possible, should be\nremoved to another room, and another bed, while the sick room, the\nbed and bedding are being purified by ventilation. If those who are\nwell need the blessings of light and air, and need to observe habits\nof cleanliness in order to remain well, the sick are in still greater\nneed of them in proportion to their debilitated condition.\nA great amount of suffering might be saved if all would labor to\nprevent disease, by strictly obeying the laws of health. Strict habits\nof cleanliness should be observed. Many, while well, will not take\nthe trouble to keep in a healthy condition. They neglect personal\ncleanliness, and are not careful to keep their clothing pure. Impurities\nare constantly and imperceptibly passing from the body, through\nthe pores, and if the surface of the skin is not kept in a healthy\ncondition, the system is burdened with impure matter. If the clothing\nworn is not often washed, and frequently aired, it becomes filthy\nwith impurities which are thrown off from the body by sensible and\ninsensible perspiration. And if the garments worn are not frequently\ncleansed from these impurities, the pores of the skin absorb again the\nwaste matter thrown off. The impurities of the body, if not allowed\nto escape, are taken back into the blood, and forced upon the internal\norgans. Nature, to relieve herself of poisonous impurities, makes an\neffort to free the system, which effort produces fevers, and what is\ntermed disease. But even then, if those who are afflicted would assist\nnature in her efforts, by the use of pure, soft water, much suffering\nwould be prevented. But many, instead of doing this, and seeking to\nremove the poisonous matter from the system, take a more deadly\npoison into the system, to remove a poison already there.\nIf every family realized the beneficial results of thorough cleanli-\nness, they would make special efforts to remove every impurity from [461]\ntheir persons, and from their houses, and would extend their efforts\nto their premises. Many suffer decayed vegetable matter to remain\nabout their premises. They are not awake to the influence of these\nthings. There is constantly arising from these decaying substances\nan effluvia that is poisoning the air. By inhaling the impure air, the\nblood is poisoned, the lungs become affected, and the whole system\nis diseased. Disease of almost every description will be cause by\ninhaling the atmosphere affected by these decaying substances.\n446 Selected Messages Book 2\nFamilies have been afflicted with fevers, some have died, and\nthe remaining portion of the family circle have almost murmured\nagainst their Maker because of their distressing bereavements, when\nthe sole cause of all their sickness and death has been the result of\ntheir own carelessness. The impurities about their own premises\nhave brought upon them contagious diseases, and the sad afflictions\nwhich they charge upon God. Every family that prizes health should\ncleanse their houses and their premises of all decaying substances.\nGod commanded that the children of Israel should in no case\nallow impurities of their persons, or of their clothing. Those who had\nany personal uncleanness were shut out of the camp until evening,\nand then were required to cleanse themselves and their clothing\nbefore they could enter the camp. Also they were commanded\nof God to have no impurities upon their premises within a great\ndistance of the encampment, lest the Lord should pass by and see\ntheir uncleanness.\nIn regard to cleanliness, God requires no less of his people now,\nthan he did of ancient Israel. A neglect of cleanliness will induce\ndisease. Sickness and premature death, do not come without a cause.\nStubborn fevers and violent diseases have prevailed in neighbor-\nhoods, and towns, that had formerly been considered healthy, and\nsome have died, while others have been left with broken constitu-\ntions to be crippled with disease for life. In many instances their own\nyards contained the agent of destruction, which sent forth deadly\npoison into the atmosphere, to be inhaled by the family, and the\nneighborhood. The slackness and recklessness sometimes witnessed,\nis beastly, and the ignorance of the results of such things upon health\nis astonishing. Such places should be purified, especially in summer,[462]\nby lime, or ashes, or by a daily burial with earth.\nSome houses are furnished expensively, more to gratify pride,\nand to receive visitors, than for the comfort, convenience and health\nof the family. The best rooms are kept dark. The light and air are shut\nout, lest the light of heaven may injure the rich furniture, fade the\ncarpets, or tarnish the picture frames. When visitors are permitted\nto be seated in these precious rooms, they are in danger of taking\ncold, because of the cellar-like atmosphere pervading them. Parlor\nchambers and bedrooms are kept closed in the same manner and for\nthe same reasons. And whoever occupies these beds which have\nChapter 4 447\nnot been freely exposed to the light and air, do so at the expense of\nhealth, and often even of life itself.\nRooms that are not exposed to light and air become damp. Beds\nand bedding gather dampness, and the atmosphere in these rooms is\npoisonous, because it has not been purified by light and air. Various\ndiseases have been brought on by sleeping in these fashionable\nhealth-destroying apartments. Every family that prizes health above\nthe empty applause of fashionable visitors, will have a circulation\nof air, and an abundance of light through every apartment of their\nhouses for several hours each day. But many will follow fashion so\nclosely, they become slaves to it, and would suffer sickness, and even\ndeath, rather than be out of fashion. They will reap that which they\nhave sown. They will live fashionably, and suffer with diseases as\nthe result, be doctored with fashionable poisons, and die fashionable\ndeaths.\nSleeping rooms especially should be well ventilated, and the\natmosphere made healthy by light and air. Blinds should be left\nopen several hours each day, the curtains put aside, and the room\nthoroughly aired. Nothing should remain, even for a short time,\nwhich would destroy the purity of the atmosphere.\nMany families suffer with sore throat, and lung diseases, and liver\ncomplaints, brought upon them by their own course of action. Their\nsleeping rooms are small, unfit to sleep in for one night, but they\noccupy the small apartments for weeks, and months, and years. They\nkeep their windows and doors closed, fearing they would take cold\nif there was a crevice open to let in the air. They breathe the same\nair over and over, until it becomes impregnated with the poisonous\nimpurities, and waste matter, thrown off from their bodies, through [463]\nthe lungs, and the pores of the skin. Such can test the matter, and\nbe convinced of the unhealthy air in their close rooms, by entering\nthem after they have remained a while in the open air. Then they can\nhave some idea of the impurities they have conveyed to the blood,\nthrough the inhalations of the lungs. Those who thus abuse their\nhealth, must suffer with disease. All should regard light and air as\namong Heaven\u2019s most precious blessings. They should not shut out\nthese blessings as though they were enemies.\nSleeping apartments should be large and so arranged as to have\na circulation of air through them, day and night. Those who have\n448 Selected Messages Book 2\nexcluded the air from their sleeping rooms, should commence to\nchange their course immediately. They should let in air by degrees,\nand increase its circulation until they can bear it winter and summer,\nwith no danger of taking cold. The lungs, in order to be healthy,\nmust have pure air.\nThose who have not had a free circulation of air in their rooms\nthrough the night, generally awake feeling exhausted, feverish, and\nknow not the cause. It was air, vital air, that the whole system\nrequired, but which it could not obtain. Upon rising in the morning,\nmost persons would be benefited by taking a sponge-bath, or, if\nmore agreeable, a hand-bath, with merely a wash-bowl of water.\nThis will remove impurities from the skin. Then the clothing should\nbe removed piece by piece from the bed, and exposed to the air. The\nwindows should be opened, and the blinds fastened back, and the\nair left to circulate freely for several hours, if not all day, through\nthe sleeping apartments. In this manner the bed and clothing will\nbecome thoroughly aired, and the impurities will be removed from\nthe room.\nShade trees and shrubbery too close and dense around a house\nare unhealthy; for they prevent a free circulation of air, and prevent\nthe rays of the sun from shining sufficiently through. In consequence\nof this, a dampness gathers in the house. Especially in wet seasons\nthe sleeping rooms become damp, and those who sleep in the beds\nare troubled with rheumatism, neuralgia, and lung complaints, which\ngenerally end in consumption. Numerous shade trees cast off many\nleaves, which, if not immediately removed, decay, and poison the\natmosphere. A yard beautified with scattering trees, and some shrub-\nbery, at a proper distance from the house, has a happy, cheerful[464]\ninfluence upon the family, and, if well taken care of, will prove no\ninjury to health. Dwellings, if possible, should be built upon high\nand dry ground. If a house be built where water settles around it,\nremaining for a time, and then drying away, a poisonous miasma\narises, and fever and ague, sore throat, lung diseases, and fevers will\nbe the result.\nMany have expected that God would keep them from sickness\nmerely because they have asked him to do so. But God did not\nregard their prayers, because their faith was not made perfect by\nworks. God will not work a miracle to keep those from sickness\nChapter 4 449\nwho have no care for themselves, but are continually violating the\nlaws of health, and make no efforts to prevent disease. When we do\nall we can on our part to have health, then may we expect that the\nblessed results will follow, and we can ask God in faith to bless our\nefforts for the preservation of health. He will then answer our prayer,\nif his name can be glorified thereby. But let all understand that\nthey have a work to do. God will not work in a miraculous manner\nto preserve the health of persons who are taking a sure course to\nmake themselves sick, by their careless inattention to the laws of\nhealth.\u2014How to Live, No. 4, pp. 54-64.\nChapter 5[465]\nIn this age of degeneracy, children are born with enfeebled con-\nstitutions. Parents are amazed at the great mortality among infants\nand youth, and say, \u201cit did not use to be so.\u201d Children were then\nmore healthy and vigorous, with far less care than is now bestowed\nupon them. Yet with all the care they now receive, they grow feeble,\nwither and die. As the result of wrong habits in parents, disease and\nimbecility have been transmitted to their offspring.\nAfter their birth, they are made very much worse by careless\ninattention to the laws of their being. Proper management would\ngreatly improve their physical health. But parents seldom pursue a\nright course toward their infant children, considering the miserable\ninheritance already received from them. Their wrong course toward\ntheir children results in lessening their hold of life, and prepares\nthem for premature death. These parents had no lack of love for\ntheir children, but this love was misapplied. One great error with the\nmother in the treatment of her infant is, she deprives it very much of\nfresh air, that which it ought to have to make it strong. It is a practice\nof many mothers to cover their infant\u2019s heads while sleeping, and\nthis, too, in a warm room, which is seldom ventilated as it should\nbe. This alone is sufficient to greatly enfeeble the action of the heart\nand lungs, thereby affecting the whole system. While care may\nbe needful to protect the infant from a draught of air, or from any\nsudden and too great change, especial care should be taken to have\nthe child breathe a pure invigorating atmosphere. No disagreeable\nodor should remain in the nursery, or about the child. Such things\nare more dangerous to the feeble infant than to grown persons.\nMothers have been in the practice of dressing their infants in ref-\nerence to fashion instead of health. The infant wardrobe is generally\nprepared to look prettily, more for show than for convenience and[466]\ncomfort. Much time is spent in embroidering, and in unnecessary\nfancy work, to make the garments of the little stranger beautiful. The\nmother often performs this work at the expense of her own health,\n450\nChapter 5 451\nand that of her offspring. When she should be enjoying pleasant\nexercise, she is often bent over work which severely taxes eyes and\nnerves. And it is often difficult to arouse the mother to her solemn\nobligations to cherish her own strength, for her own good, as well as\nthat of the child.\nShow and fashion are the demon altar upon which many Ameri-\ncan women sacrifice their children. The mother places upon the little\nmorsel of humanity the fashionable dresses which she had spent\nweeks in making, which are wholly unfit for its use, if health is to be\nregarded of any account. The garments are made extravagantly long,\nand in order to keep them upon the infant, its body is girted with\ntight bands, or waists, which hinder the free action of the heart and\nlungs. Infants are also compelled to bear a needless weight because\nof the length of their garments, and thus clothed, they do not have\nfree use of their muscles and limbs.\nMothers have thought it necessary to compress the bodies of their\ninfant children to keep them in shape, as though fearful that without\ntight bandages, they would fall in pieces, or become deformed. Do\nthe animal creation become deformed because nature is left to do her\nown work? Do the little lambs become deformed because they are\nnot girted about with bands to give them shape? They are delicately\nand beautifully formed. Human infants are the most perfect, and\nyet the most helpless, of all the Creator\u2019s handiwork, and, therefore,\ntheir mothers should be instructed in regard to physical laws, so\nas to be capable of rearing them with physical, mental, and moral\nhealth. Mothers, nature has given your infants forms which need no\ngirts or bands to perfect them. God has supplied them with bones\nand muscles sufficient for their support, and to guard nature\u2019s fine\nmachinery within, before committing it to your care.\nThe dress of the infant should be so arranged that its body will\nnot be the least compressed after taking a full meal. Dressing in-\nfants in a fashionable manner, to be introduced into company for\nvisitors to admire, is very injurious to them. Their clothing is inge-\nniously arranged to make the child miserably uncomfortable, and\nit is frequently made still more uneasy by passing from one to the\nother, being fondled by all. But there is an evil greater than those [467]\nalready named. The infant is exposed to a vitiated air, caused by\nmany breaths, some of which are very offensive and injurious to\n452 Selected Messages Book 2\nthe strong lungs of older people. The infant lungs suffer, and be-\ncome diseased by inhaling the atmosphere of a room poisoned by\nthe tobacco-user\u2019s tainted breath. Many infants are poisoned beyond\nremedy by sleeping in beds with their tobacco-using fathers. By\ninhaling the poisonous tobacco effluvia, which is thrown from the\nlungs and pores of the skin, the system of the infant is filled with the\npoison. While it acts upon some as a slow poison, and affects the\nbrain, heart, liver, and lungs, and they waste away and fade gradu-\nally, upon others it has a more direct influence, causing spasms, fits,\nparalysis, palsy, and sudden death. The bereaved parents mourn the\nloss of their loved ones, and wonder at the mysterious providence of\nGod, which has so cruelly afflicted them, when Providence designed\nnot the death of these infants. They died martyrs to the filthy lust of\ntobacco. Their parents ignorantly, but none the less surely, kill their\ninfant children by the disgusting poison. Every exhalation of the\nlungs of the tobacco slave, poisons the air about him. Infants should\nbe kept free from every thing which would have an influence to\nexcite the nervous system, and should, whether waking or sleeping,\nday and night, breathe a pure, cleanly, healthy atmosphere, free from\nevery taint of poison.\nAnother great cause of mortality among infants and youth, is\nthe custom of leaving their arms and shoulders naked. This fashion\ncannot be too severely censured. It has cost the life of thousands. The\nair, bathing the arms and limbs, and circulating about the armpits,\nchills these sensitive portions of the body, so near the vitals, and\nhinders the healthy circulation of the blood, and induces disease,\nespecially of the lungs and brain. Those who regard the health of\ntheir children of more value than the foolish flattery of visitors, or\nthe admiration of strangers, will ever clothe the shoulders and arms\nof their tender infants. The mother\u2019s attention has been frequently\ncalled to the purple arms and hands of her child, and she has been\ncautioned in regard to this health and the life-destroying practice;\nand the answer has often been, \u201cI always dress my children in this\nmanner. They get used to it. I cannot endure to see the arms of\ninfants covered. It looks old-fashioned.\u201d These mothers dress their\ndelicate infants as they would not venture to dress themselves. They[468]\nknow that if their own arms were exposed without a covering, they\nwould shiver with chilliness. Can infants of a tender age endure this\nChapter 5 453\nprocess of hardening without receiving injury? Some children may\nhave at birth so strong constitutions that they can endure such abuse\nwithout its costing them life; yet thousands are sacrificed, and tens\nof thousands have the foundation laid for a short, invalid life, by the\ncustom of bandaging and surfeiting the body with much clothing,\nwhile the arms\u2014which are at such distance from the seat of life, and\nfor that cause need even more clothing than the chest and lungs\u2014are\nleft naked. Can mothers expect to have quiet and healthy infants,\nwho thus treat them?\nWhen the limbs and arms are chilled, the blood is driven from\nthese parts to the lungs and head. The circulation is impeded, and\nnature\u2019s fine machinery does not move harmoniously. The system of\nthe infant is deranged, and it cries and mourns because of the abuse\nit is compelled to suffer. The mother feeds it, thinking it must be\nhungry, when food only increases its suffering. Tight bands and an\noverloaded stomach do not agree. It has no room to breathe. It may\nscream, struggle and pant for breath, and yet the mother not mistrust\nthe cause. She could relieve the sufferer at once, at least of tight\nbandages, if she understood the nature of the case. She at length\nbecomes alarmed, and thinks her child really ill, and summons\na doctor, who looks gravely upon the infant a few moments and\nthen deals out poisonous medicines, or something called a soothing\ncordial, which the mother, faithful to directions, pours down the\nthroat of the abused infant. If it was not diseased in reality before,\nit is after this process. It suffers now from drug-disease, the most\nstubborn and incurable of all diseases. If it recovers, it must bear\nabout more or less in its system the effects of that poisonous drug,\nand it is liable to spasms, heart disease, dropsy on the brain, or\nconsumption. Some infants are not strong enough to bear even a\ntrifle of drug-poisons, and as nature rallies to meet the intruder, the\nvital forces of the tender infant are too severely taxed, and death\nends the scene.\nIt is no strange sight in this age of the world, to view the mother\nlingering around the cradle of her suffering, dying infant, her heart\ntorn with anguish, as she listens to its feeble wail, and witnesses its\nexpiring struggles. It seems mysterious to her, that God should thus\nafflict her innocent child. She does not think that her wrong course\nhas brought about the sad result. She just as surely destroyed her [469]\n454 Selected Messages Book 2\ninfant\u2019s hold on life as though she had given it poison. Disease never\ncomes without a cause. The way is first prepared, and disease invited\nby disregarding the laws of health. God does not take pleasure in the\nsufferings and death of little children. He commits them to parents,\nfor them to educate physically, mentally and morally, and train them\nfor usefulness here, and for Heaven at last.\nIf the mother remains in ignorance in regard to the physical\nwants of her child, and, as the result, her child sickens, she need\nnot expect that God will work a miracle to counteract her agency\nin making it sick. Thousands of infants have died who might have\nlived. They are martyrs to their parent\u2019s ignorance of the relation\nwhich food, dress and the air they breathe, sustain to health and\nlife. Mothers in past ages, should have been physicians to their\nown children. The time she devoted to the extra beautifying of her\ninfant\u2019s wardrobe, she should have spent in a nobler purpose\u2014in\neducating her mind with regard to her own physical wants, and that\nof her offspring. She should have been storing her mind with useful\nknowledge, in regard to the best course she could pursue in rearing\nher children healthfully, with the view that generations would be\ninjured or benefited, by her course of action.\nMothers who have troublesome, fretful infants, should study\ninto the cause of their uneasiness. By so doing, they will often\nsee that something is wrong in their management. It is often the\ncase, that the mother becomes alarmed by the symptoms of illness\nmanifested by her child, and hurriedly summons a physician, when\nthe infant\u2019s sufferings would have been relieved by taking off its\ntight clothing, and putting upon it garments properly loose and short,\nthat it may use its feet and limbs. Mothers should study from cause\nto effect. If the child has taken cold, it is generally owing to the\nwrong management of the mother. If she covers its head, as well as\nits body while sleeping, in a short time it will be in a perspiration,\ncaused by labored breathing, because of the lack of pure, vital air.\nWhen she takes it from beneath the covering, it is almost sure to take\ncold. The arms being naked, exposes the infant to constant cold, and\ncongestion of lungs or brain. These exposures prepare the way for\nthe infant to become sickly and dwarfed.\nParents are accountable in a great degree, for the physical health[470]\nof their children. Those children who survive the abuses of their\nChapter 5 455\ninfancy, are not out of danger in their childhood. Their parents still\npursue a wrong course toward them. Their limbs, as well as their\narms, are left almost naked. Those who value fashion above health,\nplace hoops upon their children. Hoops are not convenient, modest\nor healthful. They prevent the clothing from falling close about\nthe body. Mothers then dress the upper part of their limbs with\nmuslin pantalettes, which reach about to the knee, while the lower\npart of their limbs are covered with only one thickness of flannel\nor cotton, while their feet are dressed with thin-soled gaiter boots.\nTheir garments being kept from the body by hoops, it is impossible\nfor them to receive sufficient warmth from their clothing, and their\nlimbs are continually bathed in cold air. The extremities are chilled,\nand the heart has thrown upon it double labor, to force the blood\ninto these chilled extremities, and when the blood has performed\nits circuit through the body, and returned to the heart, it is not the\nsame vigorous warm current which left it. It has been chilled in its\npassage through the limbs. The heart, weakened by too great labor,\nand poor circulation of poor blood, is then compelled to still greater\nexertion, to throw the blood to the extremities which are never as\nhealthfully warm as other parts of the body. The heart fails in its\nefforts, and the limbs become habitually cold; and the blood, which\nis chilled away from the extremities, is thrown back upon the lungs\nand brain, and inflammation and congestion of the lungs or the brain\nis the result.\nGod holds mothers accountable for the diseases their children\nare compelled to suffer. Mothers bow at the shrine of fashion, and\nsacrifice the health and lives of their children. Many mothers are\nignorant of the result of their course in thus clothing their children.\nBut should they not inform themselves, where so much is at stake?\nIs ignorance a sufficient excuse for you who possess reasoning\npowers? You can inform yourselves if you will, and dress your\nchildren healthfully.\nParents may give up the expectation of their children\u2019s having\nhealth while they dress them in cloaks and furs, and load down\nthose portions of the body with clothing where there is no call for\nsuch an amount, and then leave the extremities, that should have\nespecial protection, almost naked. The portions of the body, close\nby the life springs, need less covering than the limbs which are [471]\n456 Selected Messages Book 2\nremote from the vital organs. If the limbs and feet could have the\nextra coverings usually put upon the shoulders, lungs, and heart, and\nhealthy circulation be induced to the extremities, the vital organs\nwould act their part healthfully, with only their share of clothing.\nI appeal to you mothers, do you not feel alarmed, and heart-sick,\nin seeing your children pale and dwarfed, suffering with catarrh,\ninfluenza, croup, scrofula swellings appearing upon the face and\nneck, inflammation and congestion of lungs and brain? Have you\nstudied from cause to effect? Have you provided for them a simple\nnutritious diet, free from grease and spices? Have you not been\ndictated by fashion in clothing your children? Leaving their arms\nand limbs insufficiently protected has been the cause of a vast amount\nof disease and premature deaths. There is no reason why the feet\nand limbs of your girls, should not be in every way as warmly clad\nas those of your boys. Boys, accustomed to exercise out of doors,\nbecome inured to cold and exposure, and are actually less liable to\ncolds when thinly clad, than the girls, because the open air seems\nto be their natural element. Delicate girls, accustom themselves to\nlive in-doors, and in a heated atmosphere, and yet they go from the\nheated room out of doors with their limbs and feet seldom better\nprotected from the cold than while remaining in a close warm room.\nThe air soon chills their limbs and feet, and prepares the way for\ndisease.\nYour girls should wear the waists of their dresses perfectly loose,\nand they should have a style of dress convenient, comfortable and\nmodest. In cold weather they should wear warm flannel or cotton\ndrawers, which can be placed inside the stockings. Over these should\nbe warm lined pants, which may be full, gathered into a band, and\nneatly button around the ankle, or taper at the bottom and meet the\nshoe. Their dress should reach below the knee. With this style of\ndress, one light skirt, or at most two, is all that is necessary, and\nthese should be buttoned to a waist. The shoes should be thick-soled,\nand perfectly comfortable. With this style of dress your girls will be\nno more in danger in the open air than your boys. And their health\nwould be much better, were they to live more out of doors, even in\nwinter, than to be confined to the close air of a room heated by a\nstove.\nChapter 5 457\nIt is a sin in the sight of Heaven for parents to dress their children\nas they do. The only excuse that they can make is, it is fashion. They [472]\ncannot plead modesty to thus expose the limbs of their children with\nonly one covering drawn tight over them. They cannot plead that\nit is healthful, or really attractive. Because others will continue to\nfollow this health and life-destroying practice, it is no excuse for\nthose who style themselves reformers. Because everybody around\nyou follow a fashion which is injurious to health, it will not make\nyour sin a whit the less, or be any guarantee for the health and life\nof your children.\u2014How to Live, No. 5, pp. 66-74.\nChapter 6[473]\nMy sisters, there is need of a dress reform among us. There\nare many errors in the present style of female dress. It is injurious\nto health, and, therefore, sin for females to wear tight corsets, or\nwhalebones, or to compress the waist. These have a depressing\ninfluence upon the heart, liver, and lungs. The health of the entire\nsystem depends upon the healthy action of the respiratory organs.\nThousands of females have ruined their constitutions, and brought\nupon themselves various diseases, in their efforts to make a healthy\nand natural form unhealthy and unnatural. They are dissatisfied with\nnature\u2019s arrangements, and in their earnest efforts to correct nature,\nand bring her to their ideas of gentility, they break down her work,\nand leave her a mere wreck.\nMany females drag down the bowels and hips by hanging heavy\nskirts upon them. These were not formed to sustain weights. In\nthe first place, heavy quilted skirts should never be worn. They are\nunnecessary, and a great evil. The female dress should be suspended\nfrom the shoulders. It would be pleasing to God if there was greater\nuniformity in dress among believers. The style of dress formerly\nadopted by the Friends, is the least objectionable. Many of them\nhave backslidden, and although they may preserve the uniformity of\ncolor, yet they have indulged in pride and extravagance, and their\ndress has been of the most expensive material. Still their selection of\nplain colors, and the modest and neat arrangement of their clothing,\nis worthy of imitation by Christians.\nThe children of Israel, after they were brought out of Egypt,\nwere commanded to have a simple ribbon of blue in the border of\ntheir garments, to distinguish them from the nations around them,\nand to signify that they were God\u2019s peculiar people. The people\nof God are not now required to have a special mark placed upon\ntheir garments. But in the New Testament we are often referred to[474]\nancient Israel as examples. If God gave such definite directions to\nhis ancient people in regard to their dress, will not the dress of his\n458\nChapter 6 459\npeople in this age come under his notice? Should there not be in their\ndress a distinction from that of the world? Should not the people\nof God, who are his peculiar treasure, seek even in their dress to\nglorify God? And should they not be examples in point of dress, and\nby their simple style rebuke the pride, vanity and extravagance of\nworldly, pleasure-loving professors? God requires this of his people.\nPride is rebuked in his word.\nBut there is a class who are continually harping upon pride, and\ndress, who are careless of their own apparel, and who think it a virtue\nto be dirty, and dress without order and taste; and their clothing often\nlooks as though it flew and lit upon their persons. Their garments\nare filthy, and yet such ones will ever be talking against pride. They\nclass decency and neatness with pride. Had they been among that\nnumber who gathered around the mount to hear the law spoken from\nSinai, they would have been chased from the congregation of Israel,\nbecause they had not obeyed the command of God\u2014\u201cAnd let them\nwash their clothes,\u201d\u2014preparatory to listening to his law given in\nawful grandeur.\nThe ten commandments spoken by Jehovah from Sinai cannot\nlive in the hearts of persons of disorderly, filthy habits. If ancient\nIsrael could not so much as listen to the proclamation of that holy\nlaw, unless they had obeyed the injunction of Jehovah, and had\ncleansed their clothing, how can that sacred law be written upon\nthe hearts of persons who are not cleanly in person, in clothing,\nor in their houses? It is impossible. Their profession may be as\nhigh as Heaven, yet it is not worth a straw. Their influence disgusts\nunbelievers. Better if they had ever remained outside the ranks\nof God\u2019s loyal people. The house of God is dishonored by such\nprofessors. All who meet upon the Sabbath to worship God should,\nif possible, have a neat, well-fitting, comely suit to wear in the house\nof worship. It is a dishonor to the Sabbath, and to God and his house,\nfor those who profess that the Sabbath is the holy of the Lord, and\nhonorable, to wear the same clothing upon the Sabbath that they\nhave worn through the week while laboring upon their farms, when\nthey can obtain other. If there are worthy persons who, with their\nwhole heart would honor the Lord of the Sabbath, and the worship\nof God, and who cannot obtain a change of clothing, let those who [475]\nare able, donate to such a Sabbath suit, that they may appear in the\n460 Selected Messages Book 2\nhouse of God with cleanly, fitting apparel. A greater uniformity in\ndress would be pleasing to God. Those who expend means on costly\napparel and extra fixings, can by a little self-denial exemplify pure\nreligion, by simplicity of clothing, and then use the means they have\nusually expended needlessly in aiding some poor brother or sister,\nwhom God loves, to obtain neat and modest apparel.\nSome receive the idea that in order to carry out that separation\nfrom the world which the word of God requires, they must be ne-\nglectful of their apparel. There is a class of sisters who think that\nthey are carrying out the principle of non-conformity to the world by\nwearing an ordinary sunbonnet, and the same dress worn by them\nthrough the week, upon the Sabbath, to appear in the assembly of the\nsaints to engage in the worship of God. And some men who profess\nto be Christians view the matter of dress in the same light. They\nassemble with God\u2019s people upon the Sabbath, with their clothing\ndusty, and soiled, and even with gaping rents in them, and placed\nupon their persons in a slovenly manner. This class, if they had an\nengagement to meet a friend honored by the world, and they wished\nto be especially favored by him, would exert themselves to appear\nin his presence with the best apparel that could be obtained; for this\nfriend would feel insulted were they to come into his presence with\nhair uncombed, and garments uncleanly, and in disorder. Yet these\npersons think that it is no matter in what dress they appear, or what\nis the condition of their persons, when they meet upon the Sabbath\nto worship the great God. They assemble in his house, which is as\nthe audience-chamber of the Most High, where heavenly angels are\nin attendance, with but little respect, or reverence, as their persons\nand clothing indicate. Their whole appearance typifies the character\nof such men and women.\nThe favorite theme of this class is pride of dress. Decency,\ntaste, and order, they regard as pride. And according to the dress\nof these mistaken souls will be their conversation, their acts, and\ntheir deal. They are careless, and often low in their conversation at\ntheir homes, among their brethren, and before the world. The dress,\nand its arrangement upon the person, is generally found to be the\nindex of the man or the woman. Those who are careless and untidy\nin dress are seldom elevated in their conversation, and possess but[476]\nChapter 6 461\nlittle refinement of feelings. They sometimes consider oddity and\ncoarseness, humility.\nThe followers of Christ are represented by him as the salt of the\nearth, and the light of the world. Without the saving influence of\nChristians, the world would perish in its own corruption. Look upon\nthe class of professed Christians described, who are careless of their\ndress and persons, and loose in their business transactions, as their\ndress represents, coarse, uncourteous and rough in their manners,\nlow in their conversation; and at the same time they regard these\nmiserable traits as marks of true humility and Christian life. Think\nyou if our Saviour was upon earth, he would point to them as being\nthe salt of the earth, and the light of the world? No, never! Christians\nare elevated in their conversation, and although they believe it to be\na sin to condescend to foolish flattery, they are courteous, kind, and\nbenevolent. Their words are those of sincerity and truth. They are\nfaithful in their deal with their brethren, and with the world. In their\ndress they avoid superfluity and display; but their clothing will be\nneat, not gaudy, modest, and arranged upon the person with order\nand taste. Especial care will be taken to dress in a manner that will\nshow a sacred regard for the holy Sabbath, and the worship of God.\nThe line of demarkation between such a class and the world will\nbe too plain to be mistaken. The influence of believers would be\nten-fold greater if men and women who embrace the truth, who\nhave been formerly careless and slack in their habits, would be so\nelevated, and sanctified through the truth, as to observe habits of\nneatness, order, and good taste in their dress. Our God is a God\nof order, and he is not in any degree pleased with distraction, with\nfilthiness, or with sin.\nChristians should not take pains to make themselves gazing-\nstocks by dressing differently from the world. But if, in accordance\nwith their faith and duty in respect to their dressing modestly and\nhealthfully, they find themselves out of fashion, they should not\nchange their dress in order to be like the world. But they should\nmanifest a noble independence, and moral courage to be right, if\nall the world differ from them. If the world introduce a modest,\nconvenient, and healthful mode of dress, which is in accordance\nwith the Bible, it will not change our relation to God, or to the world\nto adopt such a style of dress. Christians should follow Christ, and [477]\n462 Selected Messages Book 2\nconform their dress to God\u2019s word. They should shun extremes.\nThey should humbly pursue a straightforward course, irrespective\nof applause or of censure, and should cling to the right, because of\nits own merits.\nWomen should clothe their limbs with regard to health and com-\nfort. They need to have their limbs and feet clad as warmly as\nmen. The length of the fashionable female dress is objectionable for\nseveral reasons.\n1. It is extravagant and unnecessary to have the dress of that\nlength that it will sweep the sidewalks and streets.\n2. A dress thus long gathers dew from the grass, and mud from\nthe streets, which makes it uncleanly.\n3. In its bedrabbled condition it comes in contact with the sen-\nsitive ankles, which are not sufficiently protected, quickly chilling\nthem, and is one of the greatest causes of catarrh, and of scrofula\nswellings, and endangers health and life.\n4. The unnecessary length is an additional weight upon the hips\nand bowels.\n5. It hinders the walking, and is also often in other people\u2019s way.\nThere is still another style of dress which will be adopted by a\nclass of so-called dress reformers. They will imitate the opposite\nsex, as nearly as possible. They will wear the cap, pants, vest, coat,\nand boots, the last of which is the most sensible part of the costume.\nThose who adopt and advocate this style of dress, are carrying the\nso-called dress reform to very objectionable lengths. Confusion\nwill be the result. Some who adopt this costume may be correct in\ntheir views in general upon the health question, and they could be\ninstrumental in accomplishing vastly more good if they did not carry\nthe matter of dress to such extremes.\nIn this style of dress God\u2019s order has been reversed, and his\nspecial directions disregarded. Deuteronomy 22:5. \u201cThe woman\nshall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man\nput on a woman\u2019s garment for all that do so are abomination unto\nthe Lord thy God.\u201d This style of dress, God would not have his\npeople adopt. It is not modest apparel, and is not at all fitting for\nmodest, humble females who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers. God\u2019s\nprohibitions are lightly regarded by all who would advocate the\ndoing away of the distinction of dress between males and females.\nChapter 6 463\nThe extreme positions taken by some dress-reformers upon this [478]\nsubject cripple their influence.\nGod designed there should be a plain distinction between male\nand female dress, and has considered the matter of sufficient impor-\ntance to give explicit directions in regard to it; for the same dress\nworn by both sexes would cause confusion, and great increase of\ncrime. St. Paul would utter a rebuke, were he alive, and should\nbehold females professing Godliness with this style of dress. \u201cIn\nlike manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,\nwith shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold,\nor pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing\nGodliness) with good works.\u201d The mass of professed Christians ut-\nterly disregard the teachings of the Apostles, and wear gold, pearls\nand costly array.\nGod\u2019s loyal people are the light of the world, and the salt of the\nearth. And they should ever remember that their influence is of value.\nWere they to exchange the extreme long, for the extreme short dress,\nthey would, to a great extent, destroy their influence. Unbelievers,\nwhom it is their duty to benefit, and seek to bring to the Lamb of\nGod, would be disgusted. Many improvements can be made in the\ndress of females in reference to health, without making so great a\nchange as to disgust the beholder.\nThe female form should not be compressed in the least with\ncorsets and whale bones. The dress should be perfectly easy that the\nlungs and heart may have healthy action. The dress should reach\nsomewhat below the top of the boot; but should be short enough to\nclear the filth of the sidewalk and street, without being raised by the\nhand. A still shorter dress than this would be proper, convenient, and\nhealthful for females, when doing their housework, and especially,\nfor those women who are obliged to perform more or less out-of-\ndoor labor. With this style of dress, one light skirt, or, at most two,\nare all that is necessary, and these should be buttoned on to a waist,\nor suspended with straps. The hips were not formed to bear heavy\nweights. The heavy skirts worn by females, their weight dragging\ndown upon the hips, have been the cause of various diseases, which\nare not easily cured, because the sufferers seem to be ignorant of\nthe cause which has produced them, and they continue to violate\nthe laws of their being by girding the waists and wearing heavy\n464 Selected Messages Book 2\nskirts, until they are made life-long invalids. Many will immediately\nexclaim, \u201cWhy such a style of dress would be old-fashioned!\u201d What[479]\nif it is? I wish we could be old-fashioned in many respects. If we\ncould have the old-fashioned strength that characterized the old-\nfashioned women of past generations it would be very desirable. I\ndo not speak unadvisedly when I say that the way in which women\nclothe themselves, together with their indulgence of appetite, is the\ngreatest causes of their present feeble diseased condition. There is\nbut one woman in a thousand who clothes her limbs as she should.\nWhatever may be the length of the dress, females should clothe their\nlimbs as thoroughly as the males. This may be done by wearing\nlined pants gathered into a band and fastened about the ankle, or\nmade full and tapering at the bottom; and these should come down\nlong enough to meet the shoe. The limbs and ankles thus clothed\nare protected against a current of air. If the limbs and feet are kept\ncomfortable with warm clothing, the circulation will be equalized,\nand the blood will remain healthy and pure, because it is not chilled\nor hindered in its natural passage through the system.\u2014How to Live,\nNo. 6, pp. 57-64.\nThe attention of the reader is called to the fact that while Mrs.\nWhite ever kept before the church the importance of attire that was\nhealthful, modest, economical, and in conformity with Christian\nsimplicity, she recognized also that within the bounds of these prin-\nciples the dress should be that which is \u201cappropriate for this age.\u201d\nIn 1897, when certain Seventh-day Adventist women questioned\nwhether, in loyalty to the Spirit of prophecy counsels, they should\nreturn to the particular style adopted in the 1860s, she counseled\nthat \u201cno one precise style\u201d had been given her \u201cas the exact rule\nto guide all in their dress.\u201d She wrote: \u201cthe Lord has not indicated\nthat it is the duty of our sisters to go back to the reform dress.\u201d Her\nstatement, setting forth the reasons for her position, appears in full as\nan appendix in D. E. Robinson\u2019s The Story of Our Health Message,\n112-130, 166-169, 427-431 1965 edition,.\u2014Compilers.\nAppendix 2\u2014Important Factors in [480]\n[481]Choosing a Life Companion\n(A statement by the trustees of the Ellen G. White Estate)\nAs the reader peruses the \u201cWord to the Reader,\u201d appearing in\neach of the two volumes of Selected Messages, he observes that the\ntwo books are comprised of lines of counsel, given through the years,\nwhich reached the field by way of pamphlets, periodical articles, and\ntypewritten messages, but were not drawn into the nine volumes of\ntestimony counsels published by Ellen White prior to her death. The\npublication in 1958 in this form provides the church with timely\ncounsels in a manner and at a time to include reference to them in\nthe three-volume comprehensive index to the writings of Ellen G.\nWhite.\nA number of pages in these two volumes and many pages in\nthe other Ellen G. White books, and also not a few of the personal\ntestimonies directed to individuals, deal with the far-reaching ques-\ntion of the selection of a life partner in marriage. These counsels\nset forth factors important to a happy, successful marriage and to\nthe happiness and welfare of the children born to that marriage.\nThey also present factors that may impair the success of the union.\nEllen White assures us that \u201cJesus wants to see happy marriages,\nhappy firesides\u201d (The Adventist Home, 99). \u201cThe Choice of a Life [482]\nCompanion,\u201d she admonished, \u201cshould be such as best to secure\nphysical, mental, and spiritual well-being for parents and for their\nchildren.\u201d\u2014The Ministry of Healing, 357.\nIn these writings the influence of the home is ever kept before the\nchurch. She called upon those looking toward marriage to consider\n466 Selected Messages Book 2\nwell the influence of the particular union contemplated. To this end\nshe urged that there should be no selfishness or covetousness or\nshortsighted decisions. (See footnote.) She called upon men and\nwomen who were planning to marry to \u201cdistinguish between what\nis pleasing and what is profitable\u201d (Letter 4, 1901). She observed\nthat \u201cit is from the marriage hour that many men and women date\ntheir success or failure in this life, and their hopes of the future\nlife.\u201d\u2014The Adventist Home, 43.\nCompatibility, Ellen White held, was vitally essential to a happy\nmarriage. She wrote of \u201clifelong wretchedness\u201d which may result\nfrom a union of those \u201cnot adapted to each other\u201d (Patriarchs and\nProphets, 189). In a message to youth she declared:\n\u201cThe world is full of misery and sin today in consequence of\nill-assorted marriages. In many cases it takes only a few months\nfor husband and wife to realize that their dispositions can never\nblend; and the result is that discord prevails in the home, where\nonly the love and harmony of heaven should exist.\u201d\u2014The Youth\u2019s\nInstructor, August 10, 1899; Messages to Young People, 453; and\nThe Adventist Home, 83.\nShe sounded a warning against \u201ca great disparity in age\u201d of those\ncontemplating marriage, which could result in \u201cimpairing the health\nof the younger\u201d partner and could rob the children \u201cof physical and\nmental strength\u201d (The Ministry of Healing, 358).\nThe state of health of the partners of a contemplated marriage\nEllen White stressed as an important factor. \u201cSickly men have often\nwon the affections of women apparently healthy, and because they\nloved each other, they felt themselves at perfect liberty to marry,\nneither considering that by their union the wife must be a sufferer,\nmore or less, because of the diseased husband.\u201d\u2014Selected Messages\n2:423. And then she carries the matter to its logical conclusion: \u201cIf\nthose who thus enter the marriage relation were alone concerned,\nthe sin would not be so great. Their offspring are compelled to be\nsufferers by disease transmitted to them.\u201d\u2014 Ibid.\nThe ability of the partners in a marriage to sustain themselves\nfinancially also was presented by Ellen White as a requisite for[483]\na successful marriage. She pointed out that there are those \u201cwho\nhave not acquired property\u201d and do \u201cnot possess physical strength,\nor mental energy, to acquire property\u201d \u201cwho have been in haste\nAppendix 2\u2014Important Factors in Choosing a Life Companion 467\nto marry, and who have taken upon themselves responsibilities of\nwhich they had no just sense.\u201d But it is the children who often\nare the greatest sufferers, for \u201cthose who are seriously deficient in\nbusiness tact, and who are the least qualified to get along in the\nworld, generally fill their houses with children\u201d which, she declares,\nmay not be \u201csuitably fed or clothed, and do not receive physical or\nmental training\u201d (Selected Messages 2:420, 421).\nThen there is another area where counsel was given. This is in\nbringing together in marriage men and women of different ethnic\nand cultural backgrounds. Four such presentations are a matter of\nmanuscript and published record. Two of the four statements on\nthis point appear in this volume, on pages 343 and 344. These were\npenned in 1896 and 1912, respectively, and were selected for pub-\nlication in this volume because they presented the basic principles\ninvolved and thus reveal why such marriages should not be encour-\naged. Such unions, it is declared, could easily create \u201ccontroversy\nand confusion.\u201d Another reason she set forth for discouraging such\nmarriages seems to be the \u201cdisadvantages\u201d which they impose upon\nthe offspring, and this could lead to \u201ca feeling of bitterness toward\nthe parents who have given them this lifelong inheritance.\u201d [Note:\nof the other two statements, the first presentation of counsel on this\npoint appears in the heart of a basic appeal made by Ellen White on\nMarch 21, 1891, to the leaders of the church to enter upon a work\nfor the colored people in the United States. See the full statement\nin The Southern Work, 1966 edition, 9-18. In this she drew in bold,\nunmistakable lines, the brotherhood of mankind and made clear that\nin worship all stood in equality before God. At the same time she\ngave voice to words of caution. In this statement, read by her to\nchurch leaders, we find these lines:\n\u201cSin rests upon us as a church because we have not made greater\neffort for the salvation of souls among the colored people.... You\nhave no license from God to exclude the colored people from your\nplaces of worship. Treat them as Christ\u2019s property, which they are,\njust as much as yourselves. They should hold membership in the\nchurch with the white brethren. Every effort should be made to wipe\nout the terrible wrong which has been done them. At the same time\nwe must not carry things to extremes and run into fanaticism on this\nquestion. Some would think it right to throw down every partition\n468 Selected Messages Book 2\nwall and intermarry with the colored people, but this is not the right\nthing to teach or to practice.\u201d\u2014The Southern Work, 15.\nThe other presentation on this point is a letter of counsel, written\nJanuary 8, 1901, to a young man who entertained plans that would\nhave resulted in marriage of one of the Caucasian race with one\nof the Negro race. Its counsels are those embodied in the similar\ncommunication of 1912 and recorded on page 344 of this volume.\nBut Ellen White adds words that call for thoughtful contemplation:\n\u201cDo not unite yourself in marriage with a girl who will have\ncause to regret the step forever after....\n\u201cO what covetous, selfish, short-sighted creatures human beings\nare. Distrust your own judgment, and depend on the judgment of\nGod. Distinguish between what is pleasing and what is profitable.\nDo God\u2019s will submissively.... Following your own way and your\nown will, you will find thorns and thistles.\u201d\u2014Ellen G. White Letter\n4, 1901.] [484]\nWhile these four messages of counsel were written at a particular\ntime to meet situations in a particular geographical area, may they\nnot serve to alert any contemplating marriage to circumstances and\nfactors that could imperil the union and bequeath to the children an\ninheritance that some may resent?\nThese counsels are among those given the believer, dealing with\na significant and far-reaching experience in life and presenting a\ncourse of action least fraught with factors that may lead to heartaches\nand could impair or destroy the union. As Ellen White says, \u201cJesus\nwants to see happy marriages, happy firesides.\u201d\nThe repeated statements made by Ellen G. White orally and\nin her writings make clear that the issue is not that of inequality\nof race. She ever maintained that there is a close brotherhood of\nmankind, and that in the records of heaven the name of the individual\nof one race stands beside the name of one of another race.

He died just as much for the colored people as for\nthe white race. Jesus came to shed light over the whole world. At\nthe beginning of His ministry He declared His mission: \u201cThe Spirit\nof the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the\ngospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to\npreach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the\nblind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, to preach the acceptable\nyear of the Lord\u201d....\n\u201cWho,\u201d says Paul, \u201cmaketh thee to differ?\u201d The God of the white\nman is the God of the black man, and the Lord declares that His love\n474 Selected Messages Book 2\nfor the least of His children exceeds that of a mother for her beloved\nchild....\nThe Lord\u2019s eye is upon all His creatures; He loves them all, and\nmakes no difference between white and black, except that He has a\nspecial, tender pity for those who are called to bear a greater burden[488]\nthan others. Those who love God and believe on Christ as their\nRedeemer, while they must meet the trials and the difficulties that lie\nin their path, should yet with a cheerful spirit accept their life as it\nis, considering that God above regards these things, and for all that\nthe world neglects to bestow, He will Himself make up to them in\nthe best of favors....\nWhen the sinner is converted he receives the Holy Spirit, that\nmakes him a child of God, and fits him for the society of the re-\ndeemed and the angelic host. He is made a joint heir with Christ.\nWhoever of the human family give themselves to Christ, whoever\nhear the truth and obey it, become children of one family. The igno-\nrant and the wise, the rich and the poor, the heathen and the slave,\nwhite or black\u2014Jesus paid the purchase money for their souls. If\nthey believe on Him, his cleansing blood is applied to them. The\nblack man\u2019s name is written in the book of life beside the white\nman\u2019s. All are one in Christ. Birth, station, nationality, or color can-\nnot elevate or degrade men. The character makes the man. If a red\nman, a Chinese, or an African gives his heart to God, in obedience\nand faith, Jesus loves him none the less for his color. He calls him\nHis well-beloved brother....\nMen may have both hereditary and cultivated prejudices, but\nwhen the love of Jesus fills the heart, and they become one with\nChrist, they will have the same spirit that He had. If a colored brother\nsits by their side, they will not be offended or despise him. They\nare journeying to the same heaven, and will be seated at the same\ntable to eat bread in the kingdom of God. If Jesus is abiding in\nour hearts we cannot despise the colored man who has the same\nSaviour abiding in his heart.\u2014Manuscript 6, 1891. Published in The\nSouthern Work, 1966 ed., 9-14.",
