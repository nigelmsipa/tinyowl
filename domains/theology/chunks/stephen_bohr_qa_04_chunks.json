The Foreign Exchange Market is where currencies are traded. A currency exchange. This international market's most unique aspect is that it lacks a central marketplace - kind of like the stock market. Instead, currency trading is conducted electronically over-the-counter.

Please, I want to know if Forex Trading is based on the same principle as gambling?\n\nA Friend's Experience::\nI had a friend who really spent a lot of time researching and doing his studying in Forex. I had the same questions like \"isn't it the same thing as gambling?\" I asked him and he said no, it's not. You have to do a lot of studying, a lot of investigation, and really learn how markets work, what currencies are a good investment, and that kind of thing.\n\nHe said ultimately there's a level of luck, I suppose, but most of it is really research that you have to do to be able to be successful in this venue. It's not something that you invest little to gain a lot - it's really more little increments and gains as you go through your investments.",

Gambling is \"you buy the lottery ticket and hope,\" whereas Forex trading requires research, analysis, and understanding of market trends. It's more in the vein of the stock market than gambling.\n\nHowever, we're not sponsoring somebody to adventure into those things.

    "text": "Question: Is there any biblical fact on the slavery issue of the black race? The Hebrews were enslaved 400 years in Egypt, and according to history, this is the 400-plus year mark for blacks who have suffered from slavery. Is there anything connecting these two periods?\n\nConclusion::\nThere is no specific Biblical exposition of black slavery, though you can find principles on responding to persecution. The 400-year parallel between Hebrew enslavement and black slavery is coincidental without prophetic significance. God fights for the downtrodden throughout history, and we must work toward the unity Christ desires, overcoming man-made racial divisions.",

Does He sometimes go back to the Holy Place, or does He do the work of the Holy Place while in the Most Holy Place since people are being born every day and confessing their sins?\n\n1 John 1:9::\n\"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\"\n\nForgiveness comes when we confess our sins. Jesus made provision - perfect provision - for whoever comes to claim the merits of His sacrifice and the merits of His life.",

In 1844, He added the judgment function (Most Holy Place work) while continuing to intercede. He does not need to go back to the Holy Place geographically - He performs both intercession and judgment simultaneously in His Most Holy Place ministry.",
