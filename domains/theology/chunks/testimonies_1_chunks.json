aggregating\n4,738 pages of text, consist of articles and letters written by Ellen\nG. White, containing instruction to, and pertaining to the welfare\nof, the Seventh-day Adventist church. A sixteen-page pamphlet,\nissued in December of 1855, marked the beginning of the series of\nsuch counsels which from time to time appeared in consecutively\nnumbered pamphlets and books. These messages naturally dealt with\nissues that were current, but in most cases we are today confronted\nby the same problems, perils, and opportunities which faced the\nchurch in earlier years.\nThe earliest numbered Testimonies were published only about\nseven years after the memorable \u201cSabbath Conferences\u201d of 1848,\nwhen Adventist believers in the newly revived Sabbath and sanctuary\ntruths laid the foundations of the distinctive doctrines held by the\nSeventh-day Adventist denomination. During these few years the\ncause had advanced in a marked manner. At the beginning there\nwere only three or four preachers, or \u201cmessengers\u201d As they then\nstyled themselves, all of them dependent upon what they earned by\nphysical labor and the freewill offerings of the few believers, who\nalso were poor in this world\u2019s goods. These beginnings were limited\nin area almost entirely to the New England States.\nBy 1855, the year of issuance of the first Testimony Pamphlet,\nthere were about a score of preachers of the Sabbath and Advent\nmessage. The number of believers had grown from less than one\nhundred to well into the second thousand.\nThe publishing work, begun by Elder White in the summer of\n1849 at Middletown, Connecticut, had been conducted in various\nplaces under adverse circumstances. Now in 1855 it was established\nin its own building in Battle Creek, Michigan.\nThe time covered by the first fourteen Testimonies now found in [6]\nV olume 1 was thirteen years. We note a few of the experiences and\nvii\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndevelopments covered by the messages given during this period of\n1855 to 1868.\nThe first defection, the apostasy and opposition of some of the\nformer brethren in the ministry, known as the Messenger party\nbecause of their publication, the Messenger of Truth, brought sorrow\nand perplexity. Early counsels speak of this movement and predict\nits speedy ending in confusion.\nFanatical movements, tending to attract conscientious souls be-\ncause of unfounded hopes of \u201csanctification,\u201d appeared in various\nplaces, notably in some of the Eastern States and in Wisconsin. In\nsome instances these teachings were accompanied by manifestation\nof the supposed \u201cgift of tongues.\u201d But clear instruction was given\nto the church which saved the cause from such deceptions of the\nenemy.\nThe lapse of time and the apparent delay of the second advent,\nwith the accession to the church of many who had not been in the\n1844 movement, with its deep spiritual consecration, had resulted\nin the loss of that first love. It was a time of speculation in lands\nand homesteads as the Western States were opening up to settlers,\namong whom were a number of believers from the crowded Eastern\nStates. Most earnest warnings and appeals were given regarding the\nprevailing dangers of conformity to the world, calling the church to\ndeeper consecration.\nIn the latter part of 1856 attention was called to the \u201cLaodicean\u201d\nmessage of Revelation 3. Formerly this counsel was understood to\napply to the Advent believers who had not followed in the advanc-\ning light of the third angel and who had organized themselves into\nanother church, bitterly opposing the Sabbath truth. Now they saw\nthemselves as \u201clukewarm\u201d and in need of heeding the counsel of\nthe true witness. For two years or more the believers were mightily\nstirred by this message, expecting that it would lead them directly[7]\ninto the loud cry of the third angel. The earnest messages in the\nTestimonies relating to this movement can better be understood with\na knowledge of this background.\nIt was an age of discussion and debates. Many of our ministers\nwere challenged to discuss the Sabbath and other truths, and some\nwere even taking the aggressive in such debates. This called for\ncounsel from heaven. One of our prominent ministers, Moses Hull,\nBackground Of Volume One ix\nengaged in debates with spiritualists, at first at their challenge, later\nat his. As a result of this daring move he was swept into the mazes\nof spiritualism. Then it was that Mrs. White published her \u201cCommu-\nnications to Elder Hull,\u201d making public letters that had been written\nto him during past years that if heeded would have saved him from\nmaking shipwreck of his faith.\nThose were the years when steps were being taken in organi-\nzation. Against this move were the fears of some who had passed\nthrough the experiences of the second angel\u2019s message, that church\norganization was a mark of \u201cBabylon.\u201d The issues of organization\nas they were met and discussed among the brethren are manifest\nin many of the communications given to the church through Mrs.\nWhite. And when in 1860 the publishing work was organized, and\nwhen, after much discussion and some questionings, the name Sev-\nenth-day Adventist was adopted, the move and the name itself were\nshown to be in harmony with the divine will.\nImmediately following the final steps in church order marked\nby the organization of the General Conference in May, 1863, came\nthe memorable vision in Otsego in June, when Mrs. White was\ngiven a view of the principles of what was termed \u201chealth reform,\u201d\nwith a revelation of the relation between obedience to the laws of\nhealth and the attainment of character necessary to fit the members\nof the church for translation. Closely associated with this was a\nreform in dress. Two years later, counsel was given that \u201cwe should [8]\nhave a health home of our own,\u201d which led to the establishment of\nthe Health Reform Institute, to which and regarding which much\ncounsel was given. As the light was followed, this institution grew\nuntil it was one of the best of its kind in the world. During the period\ncovered in this volume, the governing principles which led to its\nsuccess were clearly laid down. The problems of the civil war were\nalso met in this period as Seventh-day Adventists faced the necessity\nof defining their relationship to civil government in time of war.\nThe importance of the home in the building of Christian char-\nacter, and the responsibility of parents, were stressed, and many\nsolemn messages, imparted especially for the youth, were also given\nemphasis in these pages.\nBesides the specific issues that were closely tied into the move-\nments of the time, there was much counsel and admonition of a\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngeneral nature on church discipline and preparation for translation.\nThis was an important period in the development of the remnant\nchurch, and the Testimony counsels exerted a large molding influ-\nence.\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nBiographical Sketch [9]\nChapter 1\u2014My Childhood\nI was born at Gorham, Maine, November 26, 1827. My parents,\nRobert and Eunice Harmon, were for many years residents of this\nstate. In early life they became earnest and devoted members of the\nMethodist Episcopal Church. In that church they held prominent\nconnection, and labored for the conversion of sinners, and to build\nup the cause of God, for a period of forty years. During this time\nthey had the joy of seeing their children, eight in number, all con-\nverted and gathered into the fold of Christ. Their decided second\nadvent views, however, led to the separation of the family from the\nMethodist Church in the year 1843.\nWhile I was but a child, my parents removed from Gorham\nto Portland, Maine. Here, at the age of nine years, an accident\nhappened to me which was to affect my whole life. In company\nwith my twin sister and one of our schoolmates, I was crossing a\ncommon in the city of Portland, when a girl about thirteen years\nof age, becoming angry at some trifle, followed us, threatening to\nstrike us. Our parents had taught us never to contend with anyone,\nbut if we were in danger of being abused or injured, to hasten home\nat once. We were doing this with all speed, but the girl followed us\nas rapidly, with a stone in her hand. I turned my head to see how far\nshe was behind me, and as I did so, she threw the stone, and it hit\nme on the nose. I was stunned by the blow and fell senseless to the\nground.\nWhen consciousness returned, I found myself in a merchant\u2019s[10]\nstore; my garments were covered with blood, which was pouring\nfrom my nose and streaming over the floor. A kind stranger offered\nto take me home in his carriage, but I, not realizing my weakness,\ntold him that I preferred to walk home rather than soil his carriage\nwith blood. Those present were not aware that my injury was so\nserious, and allowed me to do as I wished; but after walking only a\nfew rods, I grew faint and dizzy. My twin sister and my schoolmate\ncarried me home.\n12\nMy Childhood 13\nI have no recollection of anything further for some time after\nthe accident. My mother said that I noticed nothing, but lay in a\nstupor for three weeks. No one but herself thought it possible for\nme to recover; but for some reason she felt that I would live. A kind\nneighbor, who had been very much interested in my behalf, at one\ntime thought me to be dying. She wished to purchase a burial robe\nfor me, but my mother said, Not yet; for something told her that I\nwould not die.\nWhen I again aroused to consciousness, it seemed to me that I\nhad been asleep. I did not remember the accident, and was ignorant\nof the cause of my illness. As I began to gain a little strength, my\ncuriosity was aroused by overhearing those who came to visit me\nsay: \u201cWhat a pity!\u201d \u201cI should not have known her,\u201d etc. I asked for\na looking glass, and upon gazing into it, was shocked at the change\nin my appearance. Every feature of my face seemed changed. The\nbones of my nose had been broken, which caused this disfigurement.\nThe thought of carrying my misfortune through life was insup-\nportable. I could see no pleasure in my existence. I did not wish to\nlive, and yet feared to die, for I was unprepared. Friends who visited\nus looked with pity upon me, and advised my parents to prosecute\nthe father of the girl who had, as they said, ruined me. But my\nmother was for peace; she said that if such a course would bring [11]\nme back my health and natural looks, there would be something\ngained; but as this was impossible, it was best not to make enemies\nby following such advice.\nPhysicians thought that a silver wire might be put in my nose to\nhold it in shape. This would have been very painful, and they feared\nit would be of little use, as I had lost so much blood and sustained\nsuch a nervous shock, that my recovery was very doubtful. Even if I\nrevived, it was their opinion that I could live but a short time. I was\nreduced almost to a skeleton.\nAt this time I began to pray the Lord to prepare me for death.\nWhen Christian friends visited the family, they would ask my mother\nif she had talked to me about dying. I overheard this, and it roused\nme. I desired to become a Christian, and prayed earnestly for the\nforgiveness of my sins. I felt a peace of mind resulting, and loved\neveryone, feeling desirous that all should have their sins forgiven\nand love Jesus as I did.\n14 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI well remember one night in winter when the snow was on the\nground, the heavens were lighted up, the sky looked red and angry,\nand seemed to open and shut, while the snow looked like blood. The\nneighbors were very much frightened. Mother took me out of bed in\nher arms and carried me to the window. I was happy; I thought Jesus\nwas coming, and I longed to see Him. My heart was full; I clapped\nmy hands for joy, and thought my sufferings were ended. But I was\ndisappointed; the singular appearance faded away from the heavens,\nand the next morning the sun rose the same as usual.\nI gained strength very slowly. As I became able to join in play\nwith my young friends, I was forced to learn the bitter lesson that\nour personal appearance often makes a difference in the treatment\nwe receive from our companions. At the time of my misfortune my\nfather was absent in Georgia. When he returned, he embraced my\nbrother and sisters, and then inquired for me. I, timidly shrinking[12]\nback, was pointed out by my mother, but my own father did not\nrecognize me. It was hard for him to believe that I was his little\nEllen, whom he had left only a few months before a healthy, happy\nchild. This cut my feelings deeply, but I tried to appear cheerful,\nthough my heart seemed breaking.\nMany times in those childhood days I was made to feel my\nmisfortune keenly. My feelings were unusually sensitive and caused\nme great unhappiness. Often with wounded pride, mortified and\nwretched in spirit, I sought a lonely place and gloomily pondered\nover the trials I was doomed daily to bear.\nThe relief of tears was denied me. I could not weep readily, as\ncould my twin sister; though my heart was heavy, and ached as if\nit were breaking, I could not shed a tear. I often felt that it would\ngreatly relieve me to weep away my sorrow. Sometimes the kindly\nsympathy of friends banished my gloom and removed, for a time, the\nleaden weight that oppressed my heart. How vain and empty seemed\nthe pleasures of earth to me then! how changeable the friendships of\nmy young companions! Yet these little schoolmates were not unlike\na majority of the great world\u2019s people. A pretty face, a handsome\ndress, attracts them; but let misfortune take these away, and the\nfragile friendship grows cold or is broken. But when I turned to\nmy Saviour, He comforted me. I sought the Lord earnestly in my\nMy Childhood 15\ntrouble, and received consolation. I felt assured that Jesus loved\neven me.\nMy health seemed to be hopelessly impaired. For two years I\ncould not breathe through my nose, and was able to attend school\nbut little. It seemed impossible for me to study and to retain what\nI learned. The same girl who was the cause of my misfortune was\nappointed monitor by our teacher, and it was among her duties to\nassist me in my writing and other lessons. She always seemed\nsincerely sorry for the great injury she had done me, although I was\ncareful not to remind her of it. She was tender and patient with me, [13]\nand seemed sad and thoughtful as she saw me laboring under serious\ndisadvantages to get an education.\nMy nervous system was prostrated, and my hand trembled so\nthat I made but little progress in writing, and could get no further\nthan the simple copies in coarse hand. As I endeavored to bend my\nmind to my studies, the letters on the page would run together, great\ndrops of perspiration would stand upon my brow, and a faintness and\ndizziness would seize me. I had a bad cough, and my whole system\nseemed debilitated. My teachers advised me to leave school and\nnot pursue my studies further till my health should improve. It was\nthe hardest struggle of my young life to yield to my feebleness and\ndecide that I must leave my studies and give up the hope of gaining\nan education.\nThree years later I made another trial to obtain an education. But\nwhen I attempted to resume my studies, my health rapidly failed,\nand it became apparent that if I remained in school, it would be at\nthe expense of my life. I did not attend school after I was twelve\nyears old.\nMy ambition to become a scholar had been very great, and when\nI pondered over my disappointed hopes, and the thought that I was\nto be an invalid for life, I was unreconciled to my lot and at times\nmurmured against the providence of God in thus afflicting me. Had\nI opened my mind to my mother, she might have instructed, soothed,\nand encouraged me; but I concealed my troubled feelings from my\nfamily and friends, fearing that they could not understand me. The\nhappy confidence in my Saviour\u2019s love that I had enjoyed during my\nillness was gone. My prospect of worldly enjoyment was blighted,\nand heaven seemed closed against me.\nChapter 2\u2014My Conversion[14]\nIn March, 1840, William Miller visited Portland, Maine, and\ngave his first course of lectures on the second coming of Christ.\nThese lectures produced a great sensation, and the Christian church\non Casco Street, occupied by Mr. Miller, was crowded day and night.\nNo wild excitement attended these meetings, but a deep solemnity\npervaded the minds of those who heard his discourses. Not only was\nthere manifested a great interest in the city, but the country people\nflocked in day after day, bringing their lunch baskets, and remaining\nfrom morning until the close of the evening meeting.\nIn company with my friends I attended these meetings and lis-\ntened to the startling announcement that Christ was coming in 1843,\nonly a few short years in the future. Mr. Miller traced down the\nprophecies with an exactness that struck conviction to the hearts of\nhis hearers. He dwelt upon the prophetic periods, and brought many\nproofs to strengthen his position. Then his solemn and powerful\nappeals and admonitions to those who were unprepared, held the\ncrowds as if spellbound.\nSpecial meetings were appointed where sinners might have an\nopportunity to seek their Saviour and prepare for the fearful events\nsoon to take place. Terror and conviction spread through the entire\ncity. Prayer meetings were established, and there was a general\nawakening among the various denominations, for they all felt more\nor less the influence that proceeded from the teaching of the near\ncoming of Christ.\nWhen sinners were invited forward to the anxious seat, hundreds\nresponded to the call, and I, among the rest, pressed through the\ncrowd and took my place with the seekers. But there was in my\nheart a feeling that I could never become worthy to be called a[15]\nchild of God. A lack of confidence in myself, and a conviction\nthat it would be impossible to make anyone understand my feelings,\nprevented me from seeking advice and aid from my Christian friends.\n16\nMy Conversion 17\nThus I wandered needlessly in darkness and despair, while they, not\npenetrating my reserve, were entirely ignorant of my true state.\nOne evening my brother Robert and myself were returning home\nfrom a meeting where we had listened to a most impressive discourse\non the approaching reign of Christ upon the earth, followed by an\nearnest and solemn appeal to Christians and sinners, urging them\nto prepare for the judgment and the coming of the Lord. My soul\nhad been stirred within me by what I had heard. And so deep was\nthe sense of conviction in my heart, that I feared the Lord would not\nspare me to reach home.\nThese words kept ringing in my ears: \u201cThe great day of the Lord\nis at hand! Who shall be able to stand when He appeareth!\u201d The\nlanguage of my heart was: \u201cSpare me, O Lord, through the night!\nTake me not away in my sins, pity me, save me!\u201d For the first time\nI tried to explain my feelings to my brother Robert, who was two\nyears older than myself; I told him that I dared not rest nor sleep\nuntil I knew that God had pardoned my sins.\nMy brother made no immediate reply, but the cause of his silence\nwas soon apparent to me; he was weeping in sympathy with my\ndistress. This encouraged me to confide in him still more, to tell\nhim that I had coveted death in the days when life seemed so heavy\na burden for me to bear; but now the thought that I might die in\nmy present sinful state and be eternally lost, filled me with terror. I\nasked him if he thought God would spare my life through that one\nnight, if I spent it agonizing in prayer to Him. He answered: \u201cI think\nHe will if you ask Him with faith, and I will pray for you and for\nmyself. Ellen, we must never forget the words we have heard this\nnight.\u201d\nArriving at home, I spent most of the long hours of darkness [16]\nin prayer and tears. One reason that led me to conceal my feelings\nfrom my friends was the dread of hearing a word of discouragement.\nMy hope was so small, and my faith so weak, that I feared if another\ntook a similar view of my condition, it would plunge me into despair.\nYet I longed for someone to tell me what I should do to be saved,\nwhat steps to take to meet my Saviour and give myself entirely up\nto the Lord. I regarded it a great thing to be a Christian, and felt that\nit required some peculiar effort on my part.\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nMy mind remained in this condition for months. I had usually\nattended the Methodist meetings with my parents; but since becom-\ning interested in the soon appearing of Christ, I had attended the\nmeetings on Casco Street. The following summer my parents went\nto the Methodist camp meeting at Buxton, Maine, taking me with\nthem. I was fully resolved to seek the Lord in earnest there, and\nobtain, if possible, the pardon of my sins. There was a great longing\nin my heart for the Christian\u2019s hope and the peace that comes of\nbelieving.\nI was much encouraged while listening to a discourse from the\nwords, I will \u201cgo in unto the king,\u201d \u201cand if I perish, I perish.\u201d In his\nremarks the speaker referred to those who were wavering between\nhope and fear, longing to be saved from their sins and receive the\npardoning love of Christ, yet held in doubt and bondage by timidity\nand fear of failure. He counseled such ones to surrender themselves\nto God, and venture upon His mercy without delay. They would find\na gracious Saviour ready to present to them the scepter of mercy,\neven as Ahasuerus offered to Esther the signal of his favor. All that\nwas required of the sinner, trembling in the presence of his Lord,\nwas to put forth the hand of faith and touch the scepter of His grace.\nThat touch ensured pardon and peace.\nThose who were waiting to make themselves more worthy of[17]\ndivine favor before they venture to claim the promises of God, were\nmaking a fatal mistake. Jesus alone cleanses from sin; He only can\nforgive our transgressions. He has pledged Himself to listen to the\npetition and grant the prayer of those who come to Him in faith.\nMany had a vague idea that they must make some wonderful effort in\norder to gain the favor of God. But all self-dependence is vain. It is\nonly by connecting with Jesus through faith that the sinner becomes\na hopeful, believing child of God. These words comforted me and\ngave me a view of what I must do to be saved.\nI now began to see my way more clearly, and the darkness began\nto pass away. I earnestly sought the pardon of my sins, and strove\nto give myself entirely to the Lord. But my mind was often in\ngreat distress because I did not experience the spiritual ecstasy that I\nconsidered would be the evidence of my acceptance with God, and I\ndared not believe myself converted without it. How much I needed\ninstruction concerning the simplicity of it!\nMy Conversion 19\nWhile bowed at the altar with others who were seeking the Lord,\nall the language of my heart was: \u201cHelp, Jesus, save me or I perish!\nI will never cease to entreat till my prayer is heard and my sins\nforgiven!\u201d I felt my needy, helpless condition as never before. As\nI knelt and prayed, suddenly my burden left me, and my heart was\nlight. At first a feeling of alarm came over me, and I tried to resume\nmy load of distress. It seemed to me that I had no right to feel\njoyous and happy. But Jesus seemed very near to me; I felt able to\ncome to Him with all my griefs, misfortunes, and trials, even as the\nneedy ones came to Him for relief when He was upon earth. There\nwas a surety in my heart that He understood my peculiar trials and\nsympathized with me. I can never forget this precious assurance\nof the pitying tenderness of Jesus toward one so unworthy of His\nnotice. I learned more of the divine character of Christ in that short\nperiod when bowed among the praying ones than ever before.\nOne of the mothers in Israel came to me and said: \u201cDear child, [18]\nhave you found Jesus?\u201d I was about to answer, \u201cYes,\u201d when she\nexclaimed: \u201cIndeed you have, His peace is with you, I see it in your\nface!\u201d Again and again I said to myself: \u201cCan this be religion? Am\nI not mistaken?\u201d It seemed too much for me to claim, too exalted\na privilege. Though too timid to openly confess it, I felt that the\nSaviour had blessed me and pardoned my sins.\nSoon after this the meeting closed, and we started for home.\nMy mind was full of the sermons, exhortations, and prayers we had\nheard. Everything in nature seemed changed. During the meeting,\nclouds and rain prevailed a greater part of the time, and my feelings\nhad been in harmony with the weather. Now the sun shone bright\nand clear, and flooded the earth with light and warmth. The trees\nand grass were a fresher green, the sky a deeper blue. The earth\nseemed to smile under the peace of God. So the rays of the Sun of\nRighteousness had penetrated the clouds and darkness of my mind,\nand dispelled its gloom.\nIt seemed to me that everyone must be at peace with God and\nanimated by His Spirit. Everything that my eyes rested upon seemed\nto have undergone a change. The trees were more beautiful and\nthe birds sang more sweetly than ever before; they seemed to be\npraising the Creator in their songs. I did not care to talk, for fear this\n20 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhappiness might pass away, and I should lose the precious evidence\nof Jesus\u2019 love for me.\nAs we neared our home in Portland, we passed men at work upon\nthe street. They were conversing with one another upon ordinary\ntopics, but my ears were deaf to everything but the praise of God,\nand their words came to me as grateful thanks and glad hosannas.\nTurning to my mother, I said: \u201cWhy, these men are all praising\nGod, and they haven\u2019t been to the camp meeting.\u201d I did not then\nunderstand why the tears gathered in my mother\u2019s eyes, and a tender[19]\nsmile lit up her face, as she listened to my simple words that recalled\na similar experience of her own.\nMy mother was a lover of flowers and took much pleasure in\ncultivating them and thus making her home attractive and pleasant\nfor her children. But our garden had never before looked so lovely\nto me as upon the day of our return. I recognized an expression of\nthe love of Jesus in every shrub, bud, and flower. These things of\nbeauty seemed to speak in mute language of the love of God.\nThere was a beautiful pink flower in the garden called the rose\nof Sharon. I remember approaching it and touching the delicate\npetals reverently; they seemed to possess a sacredness in my eyes.\nMy heart overflowed with tenderness and love for these beautiful\ncreations of God. I could see divine perfection in the flowers that\nadorned the earth. God tended them, and His all-seeing eye was\nupon them. He had made them and called them good.\n\u201cAh,\u201d thought I, \u201cif He so loves and cares for the flowers that He\nhas decked with beauty, how much more tenderly will He guard the\nchildren who are formed in His image.\u201d I repeated softly to myself:\n\u201cI am a child of God, His loving care is around me. I will be obedient\nand in no way displease Him, but will praise His dear name and love\nHim always.\u201d\nMy life appeared to me in a different light. The affliction that had\ndarkened my childhood seemed to have been dealt me in mercy for\nmy good, to turn my heart away from the world and its unsatisfying\npleasures, and incline it toward the enduring attractions of heaven.\nSoon after our return from the camp meeting, I, with several\nothers, was taken into the church on probation. My mind was very\nmuch exercised on the subject of baptism. Young as I was, I could\nsee but one mode of baptism authorized by the Scriptures, and\nMy Conversion 21\nthat was immersion. Some of my Methodist sisters tried in vain\nto convince me that sprinkling was Bible baptism. The Methodist\nminister consented to immerse the candidates if they conscientiously [20]\npreferred that method, although he intimated that sprinkling would\nbe equally acceptable with God.\nFinally the time was appointed for us to receive this solemn\nordinance. It was a windy day when we, twelve in number, went\ndown into the sea to be baptized. The waves ran high and dashed\nupon the shore; but as I took up this heavy cross, my peace was like\na river. When I arose from the water, my strength was nearly gone,\nfor the power of the Lord rested upon me. I felt that henceforth I\nwas not of this world, but had risen from the watery grave into a\nnewness of life.\nThe same day in the afternoon I was received into the church in\nfull membership. A young woman stood by my side who was also a\ncandidate for admission to the church. My mind was peaceful and\nhappy till I noticed the gold rings glittering upon this sister\u2019s fingers,\nand the large, showy earrings in her ears. I then observed that her\nbonnet was adorned with artificial flowers, and trimmed with costly\nribbons arranged in bows and puffs. My joy was dampened by this\ndisplay of vanity in one who professed to be a follower of the meek\nand lowly Jesus.\nI expected that the minister would give some whispered reproof\nor advice to this sister; but he was apparently regardless of her showy\napparel, and no rebuke was administered. We both received the right\nhand of fellowship. The hand decorated with jewels was clasped\nby the representative of Christ, and both our names were registered\nupon the church book.\nThis circumstance caused me no little perplexity and trial as I\nremembered the apostle\u2019s words: \u201cIn like manner also, that women\nadorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and so-\nbriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but\n(which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.\u201d\nThe teaching of this scripture seemed to be openly disregarded by [21]\nthose whom I looked upon as devoted Christians, and who were\nmuch older in experience than myself. If it was indeed as sinful as\nI supposed, to imitate the extravagant dress of worldlings, surely\nthese Christians would understand it and would conform to the Bible\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nstandard. Yet for myself I determined to follow my convictions of\nduty. I could but feel that it was contrary to the spirit of the gospel\nto devote God-given time and means to the decoration of our per-\nsons\u2014that humility and self-denial would be more befitting those\nwhose sins had cost the infinite sacrifice of the Son of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 3\u2014Feelings of Despair\nIn June, 1842, Mr. Miller gave his second course of lectures\nin Portland. I felt it a great privilege to attend these lectures, for I\nhad fallen under discouragements and did not feel prepared to meet\nmy Saviour. This second course created much more excitement in\nthe city than the first. With few exceptions the different denomina-\ntions closed the doors of their churches against Mr. Miller. Many\ndiscourses from the various pulpits sought to expose the alleged fa-\nnatical errors of the lecturer; but crowds of anxious listeners attended\nhis meetings, while many were unable to enter the house.\nThe congregations were unusually quiet and attentive. His man-\nner of preaching was not flowery or oratorical, but he dealt in plain\nand startling facts that roused his hearers from their careless indiffer-\nence. He supported his statements and theories by Scripture proof as\nhe progressed. A convincing power attended his words that seemed\nto stamp them as the language of truth.\nHe was courteous and sympathetic. When every seat in the [22]\nhouse was full, and the platform and places about the pulpit seemed\ncrowded, I have seen him leave the desk and walk down the aisle,\nand take some feeble old man or woman by the hand and find a\nseat for them, then return and resume his discourse. He was indeed\nrightly called Father Miller, for he had a watchful care over those\nwho came under his ministrations, was affectionate in his manner,\nof a genial disposition and tender heart.\nHe was an interesting speaker, and his exhortations, both to pro-\nfessed Christians and the impenitent, were appropriate and powerful.\nSometimes a solemnity so marked as to be painful, pervaded his\nmeetings. Many yielded to the conviction of the Spirit of God. Gray-\nhaired men and aged women with trembling steps sought the anxious\nseats. Those in the strength of maturity, the youth and children, were\ndeeply stirred. Groans and the voice of weeping and of praise to\nGod were mingled at the altar of prayer.\n23\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI believed the solemn words spoken by the servant of God, and\nmy heart was pained when they were opposed or made the subject of\njest. I frequently attended the meetings, and believed that Jesus was\nsoon to come in the clouds of heaven; but my great anxiety was to\nbe ready to meet Him. My mind constantly dwelt upon the subject\nof holiness of heart. I longed above all things to obtain this great\nblessing and feel that I was entirely accepted of God.\nAmong the Methodists I had heard much in regard to sanctifi-\ncation. I had seen persons lose their physical strength under the in-\nfluence of strong mental excitement, and had heard this pronounced\nthe evidence of sanctification. But I could not comprehend what\nwas necessary in order to be fully consecrated to God. My Christian\nfriends said to me: \u201cBelieve in Jesus now! Believe that He accepts\nyou now!\u201d This I tried to do, but found it impossible to believe that\nI had received a blessing which, it seemed to me, should electrify\nmy whole being. I wondered at my own hardness of heart in being[23]\nunable to experience the exaltation of spirit that others manifested.\nIt seemed to me that I was different from them and forever shut out\nfrom the perfect joy of holiness of heart.\nMy ideas concerning justification and sanctification were con-\nfused. These two states were presented to my mind as separate and\ndistinct from each other; yet I failed to comprehend the difference\nor understand the meaning of the terms, and all the explanations of\nthe preachers increased my difficulties. I was unable to claim the\nblessing for myself, and wondered if it was to be found only among\nthe Methodists, and if, in attending the advent meetings, I was not\nshutting myself away from that which I desired above all else, the\nsanctifying Spirit of God.\nStill, I observed that some of those who claimed to be sanctified,\nmanifested a bitter spirit when the subject of the soon coming of\nChrist was introduced; this did not seem to me a manifestation of the\nholiness which they professed. I could not understand why ministers\nfrom the pulpit should so oppose the doctrine that Christ\u2019s second\ncoming was near. Reformation had followed the preaching of this\nbelief, and many of the most devoted ministers and laymen had\nreceived it as the truth. It seemed to me that those who sincerely\nloved Jesus would be ready to accept the tidings of His coming and\nrejoice that it was at hand.\nFeelings of Despair 25\nI felt that I could claim only what they called justification. In the\nword of God I read that without holiness no man should see God.\nThen there was some higher attainment that I must reach before I\ncould be sure of eternal life. I studied over the subject continually;\nfor I believed that Christ was soon to come, and feared He would\nfind me unprepared to meet Him. Words of condemnation rang in\nmy ears day and night, and my constant cry to God was, What shall\nI do to be saved?\nIn my mind the justice of God eclipsed His mercy and love. I [24]\nhad been taught to believe in an eternally burning hell, and the hor-\nrifying thought was ever before me that my sins were too great to be\nforgiven, and that I should be forever lost. The frightful descriptions\nthat I had heard of souls in perdition sank deep into my mind. Min-\nisters in the pulpit drew vivid pictures of the condition of the lost.\nThey taught that God proposed to save none but the sanctified. The\neye of God was upon us always; every sin was registered and would\nmeet its just punishment. God Himself was keeping the books with\nthe exactness of infinite wisdom, and every sin we committed was\nfaithfully recorded against us.\nSatan was represented as eager to seize upon his prey and bear\nus to the lowest depths of anguish, there to exult over our sufferings\nin the horrors of an eternally burning hell, where, after the tortures\nof thousands upon thousands of years, the fiery billows would roll to\nthe surface the writhing victims, who would shriek: \u201cHow long, O\nLord, how long?\u201d Then the answer would thunder down the abyss:\n\u201cThrough all eternity!\u201d Again the molten waves would engulf the\nlost, carrying them down into the depths of an ever-restless sea of\nfire.\nWhile listening to these terrible descriptions, my imagination\nwould be so wrought upon that the perspiration would start, and it\nwas difficult to suppress a cry of anguish, for I seemed to already\nfeel the pains of perdition. Then the minister would dwell upon the\nuncertainty of life. One moment we might be here, and the next in\nhell, or one moment on earth, and the next in heaven. Would we\nchoose the lake of fire and the company of demons, or the bliss of\nheaven with angels for our companions? Would we hear the voice\nof wailing and the cursing of lost souls through all eternity, or sing\nthe songs of Jesus before the throne?\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nOur heavenly Father was presented before my mind as a tyrant,\nwho delighted in the agonies of the condemned; not the tender,\npitying Friend of sinners, who loves His creatures with a love past[25]\nall understanding and desires them to be saved in His kingdom.\nMy feelings were very sensitive. I dreaded giving pain to any\nliving creature. When I saw animals ill-treated, my heart ached for\nthem. Perhaps my sympathies were more easily excited by suffering\nbecause I myself had been the victim of thoughtless cruelty, resulting\nin the injury that had darkened my childhood. But when the thought\ntook possession of my mind that God delighted in the torture of His\ncreatures, who were formed in His image, a wall of darkness seemed\nto separate me from Him. When I reflected that the Creator of the\nuniverse would plunge the wicked into hell, there to burn through the\nceaseless rounds of eternity, my heart sank with fear, and I despaired\nthat so cruel and tyrannical a being would ever condescend to save\nme from the doom of sin.\nI thought that the fate of the condemned sinner would be mine,\nto endure the flames of hell forever, even as long as God Himself\nexisted. This impression deepened upon my mind until I feared that\nI would lose my reason. I would look upon the dumb beasts with\nenvy, because they had no soul to be punished after death. Many\ntimes the wish arose that I had never been born.\nTotal darkness settled upon me, and there seemed no way out\nof the shadows. Could the truth have been presented to me as I\nnow understand it, much perplexity and sorrow would have been\nspared me. If the love of God had been dwelt upon more, and His\nstern justice less, the beauty and glory of His character would have\ninspired me with a deep and earnest love for my Creator.\nI have since thought that many inmates of insane asylums were\nbrought there by experiences similar to my own. Their consciences\nwere stricken with a sense of sin, and their trembling faith dared not\nclaim the promised pardon of God. They listened to descriptions of\nthe orthodox hell until it seemed to curdle the very blood in their\nveins, and burned an impression upon the tablets of their memory.[26]\nWaking or sleeping, the frightful picture was ever before them, until\nreality became lost in imagination, and they saw only the wreathing\nflames of a fabulous hell, and heard only the shrieking of the doomed.\nReason became dethroned, and the brain was filled with the wild\nFeelings of Despair 27\nphantasy of a terrible dream. Those who teach the doctrine of an\neternal hell would do well to look more closely after their authority\nfor so cruel a belief.\nI had never prayed in public and had only spoken a few timid\nwords in prayer meeting. It was now impressed upon me that I should\nseek God in prayer at our small social meetings. This I dared not do,\nfearful of becoming confused and failing to express my thoughts.\nBut the duty was impressed upon my mind so forcibly that when I\nattempted to pray in secret I seemed to be mocking God because I\nhad failed to obey His will. Despair overwhelmed me, and for three\nlong weeks no ray of light pierced the gloom that encompassed me.\nMy sufferings of mind were intense. Sometimes for a whole\nnight I would not dare to close my eyes, but would wait until my twin\nsister was fast asleep, then quietly leave my bed and kneel upon the\nfloor, praying silently with a dumb agony that cannot be described.\nThe horrors of an eternally burning hell were ever before me. I knew\nthat it was impossible for me to live long in this state, and I dared\nnot die and meet the terrible fate of the sinner. With what envy did I\nregard those who realized their acceptance with God! How precious\ndid the Christian\u2019s hope seem to my agonized soul!\nI frequently remained bowed in prayer nearly all night, groaning\nand trembling with inexpressible anguish and a hopelessness that\npasses all description. Lord, have mercy! was my plea, and, like the\npoor publican, I dared not lift my eyes to heaven, but bowed my face\nupon the floor. I became very much reduced in flesh and strength,\nyet kept my suffering and despair to myself.\nWhile in this state of despondency I had a dream that made a [27]\ndeep impression upon my mind. I dreamed of seeing a temple, to\nwhich many persons were flocking. Only those who took refuge\nin that temple would be saved when time should close. All who\nremained outside would be forever lost. The multitudes without who\nwere going about their various ways, derided and ridiculed those\nwho were entering the temple, and told them that this plan of safety\nwas a cunning deception, that in fact there was no danger whatever to\navoid. They even laid hold of some to prevent them from hastening\nwithin the walls.\nFearing to be ridiculed, I thought best to wait until the multi-\ntude dispersed, or until I could enter unobserved by them. But the\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nnumbers increased instead of diminishing, and fearful of being too\nlate, I hastily left my home and pressed through the crowd. In my\nanxiety to reach the temple I did not notice or care for the throng\nthat surrounded me. On entering the building, I saw that the vast\ntemple was supported by one immense pillar, and to this was tied\na lamb all mangled and bleeding. We who were present seemed to\nknow that this lamb had been torn and bruised on our account. All\nwho entered the temple must come before it and confess their sins.\nJust before the lamb were elevated seats, upon which sat a com-\npany looking very happy. The light of heaven seemed to shine upon\ntheir faces, and they praised God and sang songs of glad thanksgiv-\ning that seemed like the music of the angels. These were they who\nhad come before the lamb, confessed their sins, received pardon,\nand were now waiting in glad expectation of some joyful event.\nEven after I had entered the building, a fear came over me, and a\nsense of shame that I must humble myself before these people. But I\nseemed compelled to move forward, and was slowly making my way\naround the pillar in order to face the lamb, when a trumpet sounded,\nthe temple shook, shouts of triumph arose from the assembled saints,[28]\nan awful brightness illuminated the building, then all was intense\ndarkness. The happy people had all disappeared with the brightness,\nand I was left alone in the silent horror of night. I awoke in agony\nof mind and could hardly convince myself that I had been dreaming.\nIt seemed to me that my doom was fixed, that the Spirit of the Lord\nhad left me, never to return.\nSoon after this I had another dream. I seemed to be sitting in\nabject despair with my face in my hands, reflecting like this: If\nJesus were upon earth, I would go to Him, throw myself at His feet,\nand tell Him all my sufferings. He would not turn away from me,\nHe would have mercy upon me, and I would love and serve Him\nalways. Just then the door opened, and a person of beautiful form\nand countenance entered. He looked upon me pitifully and said:\n\u201cDo you wish to see Jesus? He is here, and you can see Him if you\ndesire it. Take everything you possess and follow me.\u201d\nI heard this with unspeakable joy, and gladly gathered up all my\nlittle possessions, every treasured trinket, and followed my guide.\nHe led me to a steep and apparently frail stairway. As I commenced\nto ascend the steps, he cautioned me to keep my eyes fixed upward,\nFeelings of Despair 29\nlest I should grow dizzy and fall. Many others who were climbing\nthe steep ascent fell before gaining the top.\nFinally we reached the last step, and stood before a door. Here\nmy guide directed me to leave all the things that I had brought with\nme. I cheerfully laid them down; he then opened the door and bade\nme enter. In a moment I stood before Jesus. There was no mistaking\nthat beautiful countenance. That expression of benevolence and\nmajesty could belong to no other. As His gaze rested upon me, I\nknew at once that He was acquainted with every circumstance of my\nlife and all my inner thoughts and feelings.\nI tried to shield myself from His gaze, feeling unable to endure\nHis searching eyes, but He drew near with a smile, and, laying His [29]\nhand upon my head, said: \u201cFear not.\u201d The sound of His sweet voice\nthrilled my heart with a happiness it had never before experienced.\nI was too joyful to utter a word, but, overcome with emotion, sank\nprostrate at His feet. While I was lying helpless there, scenes of\nbeauty and glory passed before me, and I seemed to have reached\nthe safety and peace of heaven. At length my strength returned, and\nI arose. The loving eyes of Jesus were still upon me, and His smile\nfilled my soul with gladness. His presence filled me with a holy\nreverence and an inexpressible love.\nMy guide now opened the door, and we both passed out. He\nbade me take up again all the things I had left without. This done,\nhe handed me a green cord coiled up closely. This he directed me\nto place next my heart, and when I wished to see Jesus, take it from\nmy bosom and stretch it to the utmost. He cautioned me not to let it\nremain coiled for any length of time, lest it should become knotted\nand difficult to straighten. I placed the cord near my heart and\njoyfully descended the narrow stairs, praising the Lord and telling\nall whom I met where they could find Jesus. This dream gave me\nhope. The green cord represented faith to my mind, and the beauty\nand simplicity of trusting in God began to dawn upon my soul.\nI now confided all my sorrows and perplexities to my mother.\nShe tenderly sympathized with and encouraged me, advising me to\ngo for counsel to Elder Stockman, who then preached the advent\ndoctrine in Portland. I had great confidence in him, for he was a\ndevoted servant of Christ. Upon hearing my story, he placed his\nhand affectionately upon my head, saying with tears in his eyes:\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\n\u201cEllen, you are only a child. Yours is a most singular experience\nfor one of your tender age. Jesus must be preparing you for some\nspecial work.\u201d\nHe then told me that even if I were a person of mature years\nand thus harassed by doubt and despair, he should tell me that he[30]\nknew there was hope for me through the love of Jesus. The very\nagony of mind I had suffered was positive evidence that the Spirit\nof the Lord was striving with me. He said that when the sinner\nbecomes hardened in guilt, he does not realize the enormity of his\ntransgression, but flatters himself that he is about right and in no\nparticular danger. The Spirit of the Lord leaves him, and he becomes\ncareless and indifferent or recklessly defiant. This good man told me\nof the love of God for His erring children, that instead of rejoicing\nin their destruction, He longed to draw them to Himself in simple\nfaith and trust. He dwelt upon the great love of Christ and the plan\nof redemption.\nHe spoke of my early misfortune and said it was indeed a\ngrievous affliction, but he bade me believe that the hand of a loving\nFather had not been withdrawn from me; that in the future life, when\nthe mist that then darkened my mind had vanished, I would discern\nthe wisdom of the providence which had seemed so cruel and mys-\nterious. Jesus said to His disciples: \u201cWhat I do thou knowest not\nnow; but thou shalt know hereafter.\u201d In the great future we should\nno longer see as through a glass darkly, but come face to face with\nthe mysteries of divine love.\n\u201cGo free, Ellen,\u201d said he; \u201creturn to your home trusting in Jesus,\nfor He will not withhold His love from any true seeker.\u201d He then\nprayed earnestly for me, and it seemed that God would certainly\nregard the prayer of His saint, even if my humble petitions were\nunheard. I left his presence comforted and encouraged.\nDuring the few minutes in which I received instruction from\nElder Stockman, I had obtained more knowledge on the subject of\nGod\u2019s love and pitying tenderness than from all the sermons and\nexhortations to which I had ever listened. I returned home and again\nwent before the Lord, promising to do and suffer anything He might\nrequire of me, if only the smiles of Jesus might cheer my heart.\nThe same duty was presented to me that had troubled my mind[31]\nbefore\u2014to take up my cross among the assembled people of God.\nFeelings of Despair 31\nAn opportunity was not long wanting; there was a prayer meeting\nthat evening, which I attended.\nI bowed trembling during the prayers that were offered. After a\nfew had prayed, I lifted up my voice in prayer before I was aware\nof it. The promises of God appeared to me like so many precious\npearls that were to be received only for the asking. As I prayed, the\nburden and agony of soul that I had so long endured left me, and\nthe blessing of the Lord descended upon me like the gentle dew. I\npraised God from the depths of my heart. Everything seemed shut\nout from me but Jesus and His glory, and I lost consciousness of\nwhat was passing around me.\nThe Spirit of God rested upon me with such power that I was\nunable to go home that night. When I did return, on the following\nday, a great change had taken place in my mind. It seemed to me\nthat I could hardly be the same person that left my father\u2019s house\nthe previous evening. This passage was continually in my thoughts:\n\u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\u201d My heart was full of\nhappiness as I softly repeated these words.\nMy views of the Father were changed. I now looked upon Him\nas a kind and tender parent, rather than a stern tyrant compelling men\nto a blind obedience. My heart went out toward Him in a deep and\nfervent love. Obedience to His will seemed a joy; it was a pleasure\nto be in His service. No shadow clouded the light that revealed to me\nthe perfect will of God. I felt the assurance of an indwelling Saviour,\nand realized the truth of what Christ had said: \u201cHe that followeth\nMe shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d\nMy peace and happiness was in such marked contrast with my\nformer gloom and anguish that it seemed to me as if I had been\nrescued from hell and transported to heaven. I could even praise [32]\nGod for the misfortune that had been the trial of my life, for it had\nbeen the means of fixing my thoughts upon eternity. Naturally proud\nand ambitious, I might not have been inclined to give my heart to\nJesus had it not been for the sore affliction that had cut me off, in a\nmanner, from the triumphs and vanities of the world.\nFor six months not a shadow clouded my mind, nor did I neglect\none known duty. My whole endeavor was to do the will of God\nand keep Jesus and heaven continually in mind. I was surprised\nand enraptured with the clear views now presented to me of the\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\natonement and the work of Christ. I will not attempt to further\nexplain the exercises of my mind; suffice it to say that old things had\npassed away, all things had become new. There was not a cloud to\nmar my perfect bliss. I longed to tell the story of Jesus\u2019 love, but\nfelt no disposition to engage in common conversation with anyone.\nMy heart was so filled with love to God and the peace that passeth\nunderstanding that I loved to meditate and to pray.\nThe night after receiving so great a blessing, I attended the advent\nmeeting. When the time came for the followers of Christ to speak\nin His favor, I could not remain silent, but rose and related my\nexperience. Not a thought had entered my mind of what I should\nsay; but the simple story of Jesus\u2019 love to me fell from my lips with\nperfect freedom, and my heart was so happy to be liberated from its\nbondage of dark despair that I lost sight of the people about me and\nseemed to be alone with God. I found no difficulty in expressing my\npeace and happiness, except for the tears of gratitude that choked\nmy utterance as I told of the wondrous love that Jesus had shown for\nme.\nElder Stockman was present. He had recently seen me in deep\ndespair, and the remarkable change in my appearance and feelings\ntouched his heart; he wept aloud, rejoicing with me and praising\nGod for this proof of His tender mercy and loving-kindness.\nNot long after receiving this great blessing, I attended a con-[33]\nference meeting at the Christian church, where Elder Brown was\npastor. I was invited to relate my experience, and I felt not only great\nfreedom of expression, but happiness, in telling my simple story of\nthe love of Jesus and the joy of being accepted of God. As I spoke,\nwith subdued heart and tearful eyes, my soul seemed drawn toward\nheaven in thanksgiving. The melting power of the Lord came upon\nthe assembled people. Many were weeping and others praising God.\nSinners were invited to arise for prayers, and many responded to\nthe call. My heart was so thankful to God for the blessing He had\ngiven me that I longed to have others participate in this sacred joy.\nMy mind was deeply interested for those who might be suffering\nunder a sense of the Lord\u2019s displeasure and the burden of sin. While\nrelating my experience, I felt that no one could resist the evidence of\nGod\u2019s pardoning love that had wrought so wonderful a change in me.\nThe reality of true conversion seemed so plain to me that I felt like\nFeelings of Despair 33\nhelping my young friends into the light, and at every opportunity\nexerted my influence toward this end.\nI arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were\nconsiderably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A\nnumber of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded\nto them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I\ndetermined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls,\nfor whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire\nnights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had\nsought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and\npraying with them.\nSome of these had met with us from curiosity to hear what I had\nto say; others thought me beside myself to be so persistent in my\nefforts, especially when they manifested no concern on their own\npart. But at every one of our little meetings I continued to exhort and [34]\npray for each one separately, until every one had yielded to Jesus,\nacknowledging the merits of His pardoning love. Every one was\nconverted to God.\nNight after night in my dreams I seemed to be laboring for the\nsalvation of souls. At such times special cases were presented to\nmy mind; these I afterward sought out and prayed with. In every\ninstance but one these persons yielded themselves to the Lord. Some\nof our more formal brethren feared that I was too zealous for the\nconversion of souls, but time seemed to me so short that it behooved\nall who had a hope of a blessed immortality and looked for the soon\ncoming of Christ, to labor without ceasing for those who were still\nin their sins and standing on the awful brink of ruin.\nThough I was very young, the plan of salvation was so clear to\nmy mind, and my personal experience had been so marked, that,\nupon considering the matter, I knew it was my duty to continue my\nefforts for the salvation of precious souls and to pray and confess\nChrist at every opportunity. My entire being was offered to the\nservice of my Master. Let come what would, I determined to please\nGod, and live as one who expected the Saviour to come and reward\nthe faithful. I felt like a little child coming to God as to my father,\nand asking Him what He would have me to do. Then as my duty\nwas made plain to me, it was my greatest happiness to perform it.\nPeculiar trials sometimes beset me. Those older in experience than\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmyself endeavored to hold me back and cool the ardor of my faith;\nbut with the smiles of Jesus brightening my life, and the love of God\nin my heart, I went on my way with a joyful spirit.\nAs often as I recall the experience of my early life, my brother,\nthe confidant of my hopes and fears, the earnest sympathizer with\nme in my Christian experience, comes to my mind with a flood of\ntender memories. He was one of those to whom sin presents but few\ntemptations. Naturally devotional, he never sought the society of the[35]\nyoung and gay, but chose rather the company of Christians whose\nconversation would instruct him in the way of life. His manner was\nserious beyond his years; he was gentle and peaceful, and his mind\nwas almost constantly filled with religious thoughts. His life was\npointed to, by those who knew him, as a pattern to the youth, a living\nexample of the grace and beauty of true Christianity.\n* * * * *\nChapter 4\u2014Leaving the Methodist Church\nMy father\u2019s family still occasionally attended the Methodist\nchurch, and also the class meetings held in private houses. One\nevening my brother Robert and myself went to class meeting. The\npresiding elder was present. When it came my brother\u2019s turn, he\nspoke with great humility, yet with clearness, of the necessity for a\ncomplete fitness to meet our Saviour, when He should come in the\nclouds of heaven with power and great glory. While my brother was\nspeaking, a heavenly light glowed upon his usually pale countenance.\nHe seemed to be carried in spirit above present surroundings, and\nspoke as if in the presence of Jesus. When I was called upon to\nspeak, I arose, free in spirit, with a heart full of love and peace.\nI told the story of my great suffering under the conviction of sin,\nhow I had at length received the blessing so long sought, an entire\nconformity to the will of God, and expressed my joy in the tidings\nof the soon coming of my Redeemer to take His children home.\nIn my simplicity I expected that my Methodist brethren and\nsisters would understand my feelings and rejoice with me. But I was\ndisappointed; several sisters groaned and moved their chairs noisily,\nturning their backs upon me. I could not think what had been said to [36]\noffend them, and spoke very briefly, feeling the chilling influence of\ntheir disapprobation. When I had ceased speaking, Elder B. asked\nme if it would not be more pleasant to live a long life of usefulness,\ndoing others good, than to have Jesus come speedily and destroy\npoor sinners. I replied that I longed for the coming of Jesus. Then\nsin would have an end, and we would enjoy sanctification forever,\nwith no devil to tempt and lead us astray.\nHe then inquired if I would not rather die peacefully upon my\nbed than to pass through the pain of being changed, while living,\nfrom mortality to immortality. My answer was that I wished for\nJesus to come and take His children; that I was willing to live or\ndie as God willed, and could easily endure all the pain that could\nbe borne in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye; that I desired the\n35\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwheels of time to roll swiftly round, and bring the welcome day\nwhen these vile bodies should be changed, and fashioned like unto\nChrist\u2019s most glorious body. I also stated that when I lived nearest\nto the Lord, then I most earnestly longed for His appearing. Here\nsome present seemed to be greatly displeased.\nWhen the presiding elder addressed others in the class, he ex-\npressed great joy in anticipating the temporal millennium, when\nthe earth should be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the\nwaters cover the sea. He longed to see this glorious period ushered\nin. After the meeting closed, I was conscious of being treated with\nmarked coldness by those who had formerly been kind and friendly\nto me. My brother and I returned home feeling sad that we should\nbe so misunderstood by our brethren, and that the subject of the\nnear coming of Jesus should awaken such bitter opposition in their\nbreasts. Yet we were thankful that we could discern the precious\nlight and rejoice in looking for the coming of the Lord.\nNot long after this we again attended the class meeting. We[37]\nwanted an opportunity to speak of the precious love of God that ani-\nmated our souls. I particularly wished to tell of the Lord\u2019s goodness\nand mercy to me. So great a change had been wrought in me that it\nseemed my duty to improve every opportunity of testifying to the\nlove of my Saviour.\nWhen my turn came to speak, I stated the evidences I enjoyed\nof Jesus\u2019 love, and that I looked forward with the glad expectation\nof meeting my Redeemer soon. The belief that Christ\u2019s coming was\nnear had stirred my soul to seek more earnestly for the sanctification\nof the Spirit of God. Here the class leader interrupted me, saying:\n\u201cYou received sanctification through Methodism, throughMethod-\nism, sister, not through an erroneous theory.\u201d I felt compelled to\nconfess the truth, that it was not through Methodism that my heart\nhad received its new blessing, but by the stirring truths concerning\nthe personal appearing of Jesus. Through them I had found peace,\njoy, and perfect love. Thus my testimony closed, the last that I was\nto bear in class with my Methodist brethren.\nRobert then spoke in his meek way, yet in so clear and touching\na manner that some wept and were much moved; but others coughed\ndissentingly and seemed quite uneasy. After leaving the class room,\nwe again talked over our faith, and marveled that our Christian\nLeaving the Methodist Church 37\nbrethren and sisters could so ill endure to have a word spoken in\nreference to our Saviour\u2019s coming. We thought if they loved Jesus\nas they should, it would not be so great an annoyance to hear of His\nsecond advent, but, on the contrary, they would hail the news with\njoy.\nWe were convinced that we ought no longer to attend the class\nmeeting. The hope of the glorious appearing of Christ filled our souls\nand would find expression when we rose to speak. This seemed to\nkindle the ire of those present against the two humble children who\ndared, in the face of opposition, to speak of the faith that had filled\ntheir hearts with peace and happiness. It was evident that we could [38]\nhave no freedom in the class meeting; for our testimony provoked\nsneers and taunts that reached our ears at the close of the meeting,\nfrom brethren and sisters whom we had respected and loved.\nThe Adventists held meetings at this time in Beethoven Hall. My\nfather, with his family, attended them quite regularly. The period\nof the second advent was thought to be in the year 1843. The time\nseemed so short in which souls could be saved that I resolved to do\nall that was in my power to lead sinners into the light of truth. But\nit seemed impossible for one so young, and in feeble health, to do\nmuch in the great work.\nI had two sisters at home, Sarah, who was several years older,\nand my twin sister, Elizabeth. We talked the matter over among\nourselves, and decided to earn what money we could, and spend it\nin buying books and tracts to be distributed gratuitously. This was\nthe best we could do, and we did this little gladly. I could earn only\ntwenty-five cents a day; but my dress was plain, nothing was spent\nfor needless ornaments, for vain display appeared sinful in my eyes;\nso I had ever a little fund in store with which to purchase suitable\nbooks. These were placed in the hands of experienced persons to\nsend abroad.\nEvery leaf of this printed matter seemed precious in my eyes, for\nit was as a messenger of light to the world, bidding them prepare\nfor the great event near at hand. Day after day I sat in bed propped\nup with pillows, performing my allotted task with trembling fingers.\nHow carefully would I lay aside the precious bits of silver taken in\nreturn, which were to be expended for reading matter to enlighten\nand arouse those who were in darkness. I had no temptation to\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nspend my earnings for my own personal gratification; the salvation\nof souls was the burden of my mind, and my heart ached for those\nwho flattered themselves that they were living in security, while the[39]\nmessage of warning was being given to the world.\nOne day I listened to a conversation between my mother and\na sister, in reference to a discourse which they had recently heard,\nto the effect that the soul had not natural immortality. Some of\nthe minister\u2019s proof texts were repeated. Among them I remember\nthese impressed me very forcibly: \u201cThe soul that sinneth, it shall\ndie.\u201d \u201cThe living know that they shall die: but the dead know not\nanything.\u201d \u201cWhich in His times He shall show, who is the blessed\nand only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of Lords; who only\nhath immortality.\u201d \u201cTo them who by patient continuance in well-\ndoing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life.\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d\nsaid my mother, after quoting the foregoing passage, \u201cshould they\nseek for what they already have?\u201d\nI listened to these new ideas with an intense and painful interest.\nWhen alone with my mother, I inquired if she really believed that\nthe soul was not immortal. Her reply was that she feared we had\nbeen in error on that subject as well as upon some others.\n\u201cBut, mother,\u201d said I, \u201cdo you really believe that the soul sleeps\nin the grave until the resurrection? Do you think that the Christian,\nwhen he dies, does not go immediately to heaven, nor the sinner to\nhell?\u201d\nShe answered: \u201cThe Bible gives us no proof that there is an\neternally burning hell. If there is such a place, it should be mentioned\nin the Sacred Book.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, mother!\u201d cried I, in astonishment, \u201cthis is strange talk for\nyou! If you believe this strange theory, do not let any one know of\nit; for I fear that sinners would gather security from this belief, and\nnever desire to seek the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cIf this is sound Bible truth,\u201d she replied, \u201cinstead of preventing\nthe salvation of sinners, it will be the means of winning them to\nChrist. If the love of God will not induce the rebel to yield, the\nterrors of an eternal hell will not drive him to repentance. Besides,[40]\nit does not seem a proper way to win souls to Jesus, by appealing\nto one of the lowest attributes of the mind, abject fear. The love of\nJesus attracts; it will subdue the hardest heart.\u201d\nLeaving the Methodist Church 39\nIt was some months after this conversation before I heard any-\nthing further concerning this doctrine; but during this time my mind\nhad been much exercised upon the subject. When I heard it preached,\nI believed it to be the truth. From the time that light in regard to\nthe sleep of the dead dawned upon my mind, the mystery that had\nenshrouded the resurrection vanished, and the great event itself as-\nsumed a new and sublime importance. My mind had often been\ndisturbed by its efforts to reconcile the immediate reward or pun-\nishment of the dead with the undoubted fact of a future resurrection\nand judgment. If at death the soul entered upon eternal happiness or\nmisery, where was the need of a resurrection of the poor moldering\nbody?\nBut this new and beautiful faith taught me the reason why in-\nspired writers had dwelt so much upon the resurrection of the body;\nit was because the entire being was slumbering in the grave. I could\nnow clearly perceive the fallacy of our former position on this ques-\ntion. The confusion and uselessness of a final judgment, after the\nsouls of the departed had already been judged once and appointed\nto their lot, was very plain to me now. I saw that the hope of the be-\nreaved is in looking forward to the glorious day when the Life-giver\nshall break the fetters of the tomb, and the righteous dead shall arise\nand leave their prison house to be clothed with glorious immortal\nlife.\nOur family were all interested in the doctrine of the Lord\u2019s soon\ncoming. My father had long been considered one of the pillars of\nthe Methodist church where he lived, and the whole family had\nbeen active members; but we made no secret of our new belief,\nalthough we did not urge it upon others on inappropriate occasions,\nor manifest any unfriendliness toward our church. However, the [41]\nMethodist minister made us a special visit and took the occasion to\ninform us that our faith and Methodism could not agree. He did not\ninquire our reasons for believing as we did, nor make any reference\nto the Bible in order to convince us of our error; but he stated that\nwe had adopted a new and strange belief that the Methodist Church\ncould not accept.\nMy father replied that he must be mistaken in calling this a new\nand strange doctrine, that Christ Himself, in His teachings to His\ndisciples, had preached His second advent. He had said: \u201cIn My\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nFather\u2019s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have\ntold you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a\nplace for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that\nwhere I am, there ye may be also.\u201d When He was taken up to heaven\nbefore their eyes and a cloud received Him out of their sight, as His\nfaithful followers stood gazing after their vanishing Lord, \u201cbehold,\ntwo men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of\nGalilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which\nis taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye\nhave seen Him go into heaven.\u201d\n\u201cAnd,\u201d said my father, warming with his subject, \u201cthe inspired\nPaul wrote a letter to encourage his brethren in Thessalonica, saying:\n\u2018And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall\nbe revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire\ntaking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not\nthe gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with\neverlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the\nglory of His power; when He shall come to be glorified in His saints,\nand to be admired in all them that believe ... in that day.\u2019 \u2018For the\nLord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice\nof the Archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ\nshall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught[42]\nup together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and\nso shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another\nwith these words.\u2019\n\u201cThis is high authority for our faith. Jesus and His apostles dwell\nupon the event of the second advent with joy and triumph; and the\nholy angels proclaim that Christ, who ascended to heaven, shall\ncome again. This is our offense, believing the word of Jesus and His\ndisciples. This is a very old doctrine, and bears no taint of heresy.\u201d\nThe minister did not attempt to refer to a single text that would\nprove us in error, but excused himself on the plea of a want of time.\nHe advised us to quietly withdraw from the church and avoid the\npublicity of a trial. We were aware that others of our brethren were\nmeeting with similar treatment for a like cause, and we did not wish\nit understood that we were ashamed to acknowledge our faith, or\nwere unable to sustain it by Scripture; so my parents insisted that\nthey should be acquainted with the reasons for this request.\nLeaving the Methodist Church 41\nThe only answer to this was an evasive declaration that we had\nwalked contrary to the rules of the church, and the best course would\nbe to voluntarily withdraw from it to save a trial. We answered that\nwe preferred a regular trial, and demanded to know what sin was\ncharged to us, as we were conscious of no wrong in looking for and\nloving the appearing of the Saviour.\nNot long after, we were notified to be present at a meeting to be\nheld in the vestry of the church. There were but few present. The\ninfluence of my father and his family was such that our opposers had\nno desire to present our case before a larger number of the congrega-\ntion. The single charge preferred was that we had walked contrary\nto their rules. Upon our asking what rules we had violated, it was\nstated, after a little hesitation, that we had attended other meetings,\nand had neglected to meet regularly with our class. We stated that a [43]\nportion of the family had been in the country for some time past, that\nnone who remained in the city had been absent from class meeting\nmore than a few weeks, and they were morally compelled to remain\naway because the testimonies they bore met with such marked dis-\napprobation. We also reminded them that certain persons who had\nnot attended class meeting for a year were yet held in good standing.\nIt was asked if we would confess that we had departed from their\nrules, and if we would also agree to conform to them in the future.\nWe answered that we dared not yield our faith or deny the sacred\ntruth of God; that we could not forego the hope of the soon coming\nof our Redeemer; that after the manner which they called heresy\nwe must continue to worship the Lord. My father in his defense\nreceived the blessing of God, and we all left the vestry with free\nspirits, happy in the consciousness of right and the approving smile\nof Jesus.\nThe next Sunday, at the commencement of the love feast, the\npresiding elder read off our names, seven in number, as discontinued\nfrom the church. He stated that we were not expelled on account\nof any wrong or immoral conduct, that we were of unblemished\ncharacter and enviable reputation, but we had been guilty of walking\ncontrary to the rules of the Methodist Church. He also declared that\na door was now open, and all who were guilty of a similar breach of\nthe rules would be dealt with in like manner.\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThere were many in the church who waited for the appearing of\nthe Saviour, and this threat was made for the purpose of frightening\nthem into subjection. In some cases this policy brought about the\ndesired result, and the favor of God was sold for a place in the church.\nMany believed, but dared not confess their faith, lest they should\nbe turned out of the synagogue. But some left soon afterward and\njoined the company of those who were looking for the Saviour.\nAt this time the words of the prophet were exceedingly precious:[44]\n\u201cYour brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My name\u2019s sake,\nsaid, Let the Lord be glorified: but He shall appear to your joy, and\nthey shall be ashamed.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 5\u2014Opposition of Formal Brethren\nFor six months not a cloud intervened between me and my\nSaviour. Whenever there was a proper opportunity, I bore my testi-\nmony, and was greatly blessed. At times the Spirit of the Lord rested\nupon me with such power that my strength was taken from me. This\nwas a trial to some who had come out from the formal churches, and\nremarks were often made that grieved me much. Many could not\nbelieve that one could be so overpowered by the Spirit of God as\nto lose all strength. My position was exceedingly painful. I began\nto reason with myself whether I was not justified in withholding\nmy testimony in meeting, and thus restraining my feelings, when\nthere was such an opposition in the hearts of some who were older\nin years and experience than myself.\nI adopted this plan of silence for a time, trying to convince myself\nthat to repress my testimony would not hinder me from faithfully\nliving out my religion. I often felt strongly impressed that it was\nmy duty to speak in meeting, but refrained from doing so, and was\nsensible of having thereby grieved the Spirit of God. I even remained\naway from meetings sometimes because they were to be attended\nby those whom my testimony annoyed. I shrank from offending\nmy brethren, and in this allowed the fear of man to break up that\nuninterrupted communion with God which had blessed my heart for\nso many months.\nWe had appointed evening prayer meetings in different localities\nof the city to accommodate all who wished to attend them. The [45]\nfamily that had been most forward in opposing me attended one of\nthese. Upon this occasion, while those assembled were engaged\nin prayer, the Spirit of the Lord came upon the meeting, and one\nof the members of this family was prostrated as one dead. His\nrelatives stood weeping around him, rubbing his hands and applying\nrestoratives. At length he gained sufficient strength to praise God,\nand quieted their fears by shouting with triumph over the marked\n43\n44 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nevidence he had received of the power of the Lord upon him. The\nyoung man was unable to return home that night.\nThis was believed by the family to be a manifestation of the\nSpirit of God, but did not convince them that it was the same divine\npower that had rested upon me at times, robbing me of my natural\nstrength and filling my soul with the peace and love of Jesus. They\nwere free to say that my sincerity and perfect honesty could not be\ndoubted, but they considered me self-deceived in taking that for the\npower of the Lord which was only the result of my own overwrought\nfeelings.\nMy mind was in great perplexity in consequence of this oppo-\nsition, and as the time drew near for our regular meeting, I was\nin doubt whether or not it was best for me to attend it. For some\ndays previous I had been in great distress on account of the feeling\nmanifested toward me. Finally I decided to remain at home, and\nthus escape the criticism of my brethren. In trying to pray, I repeated\nthese words again and again: \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to\ndo?\u201d The answer that came to my heart seemed to bid me trust in my\nheavenly Father and wait patiently to know His will. I yielded myself\nto the Lord with the simple trust of a little child, remembering He\nhad promised that those who follow Him shall not walk in darkness.\nA sense of duty impelled me to go to the meeting, and I went with\nthe full assurance in my mind that all would be well. While we were\nbowed before the Lord, my heart was drawn out in prayer and filled\nwith a peace that only Christ can give. My soul rejoiced in the love[46]\nof the Saviour, and physical strength left me. With childlike faith I\ncould only say: \u201cHeaven is my home, and Christ my Redeemer.\u201d\nOne of the family before mentioned as being opposed to the\nmanifestations of the power of God upon me, on this occasion stated\nhis belief that I was under an excitement which he thought it my\nduty to resist, but instead of doing so, he thought I encouraged it\nas a mark of God\u2019s favor. His doubts and opposition did not affect\nme at this time, for I seemed shut in with the Lord, and lifted above\nall outward influence; but he had scarcely stopped speaking when\na strong man, a devoted and humble Christian, was struck down\nbefore his eyes by the power of God, and the room was filled with\nthe Holy Spirit.\nOpposition of Formal Brethren 45\nUpon recovering, I was very happy in bearing my testimony for\nJesus and in telling of His love for me. I confessed my lack of faith\nin the promises of God and my error in checking the promptings of\nHis Spirit from fear of men, and acknowledged that, notwithstanding\nmy distrust, He had bestowed upon me unlooked-for evidence of His\nlove and sustaining grace. The brother who had opposed me then\nrose, and with tears confessed that his feelings in regard to me had\nbeen all wrong. He humbly asked my forgiveness, and said: \u201cSister\nEllen, I will never again lay a straw in your way. God has shown me\nthe coldness and stubbornness of my heart, which He has broken by\nthe evidence of His power. I have been very wrong.\u201d\nThen, turning to the people, he said: \u201cWhen Sister Ellen seemed\nso happy, I would think, Why do I not feel like that? Why doesn\u2019t\nBrother R. receive some such evidence? for I was convinced that he\nwas a devoted Christian, yet no such power had fallen upon him. I\noffered a silent prayer, that, if this was the holy influence of God,\nBrother R. might experience it this evening.\n\u201cAlmost as the desire went up from my heart, Brother R. fell, [47]\nprostrated by the power of God, crying: \u2018Let the Lord work!\u2019 My\nheart is convinced that I have been warring against the Holy Spirit,\nbut I will grieve it no more by stubborn unbelief. Welcome, light!\nWelcome, Jesus! I have been backslidden and hardened, feeling\noffended if anyone praised God and manifested a fullness of joy\nin His love; but now my feelings are changed, my opposition is at\nan end, Jesus has opened my eyes, and I may yet shout His praises\nmyself. I have said bitter and cutting things of Sister Ellen that I\nsorrow over now, and I pray for her forgiveness and that of all others\nwho are present.\u201d\nBrother R. then bore his testimony. His face was lighted with\nthe glory of heaven as he praised the Lord for the wonders He had\nwrought that night. Said he: \u201cThis place is awfully solemn because\nof the presence of the Most High. Sister Ellen, in future you will have\nour help and sustaining sympathies, instead of the cruel opposition\nthat has been shown you. We have been blind to the manifestations\nof God\u2019s Holy Spirit.\u201d\nAll the opposers were now brought to see their mistake and to\nconfess that the work was indeed of the Lord. In a prayer meeting\nsoon after, the brother who had confessed that he was wrong in his\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nopposition, experienced the power of God in so great a degree that\nhis countenance shone with a heavenly light, and he fell helpless\nto the floor. When his strength returned, he again acknowledged\nthat he had been ignorantly warring against the Spirit of the Lord in\ncherishing the feeling he had against me. In another prayer meeting\nstill another member of the same family was exercised in a similar\nmanner and bore the same testimony. A few weeks after, while the\nlarge family of Brother P. were engaged in prayer at their own house,\nthe Spirit of God swept through the room and prostrated the kneeling\nsuppliants. My father came in soon after, and found them all, both\nparents and children, helpless under the power of the Lord.\nCold formality began to melt before the mighty influence of the[48]\nMost High. All who had opposed me confessed that they had grieved\nthe Holy Spirit by so doing, and they united in sympathy with me\nand in love for the Saviour. My heart was glad that divine mercy had\nsmoothed the path for my feet to tread, and rewarded my faith and\ntrust so bounteously. Unity and peace now dwelt among our people\nwho were looking for the coming of the Lord.\n* * * * *\nChapter 6\u2014Advent Experience\nWith carefulness and trembling we approached the time [The\nyear 1843, Jewish time, was believed to reach from March 21, 1843,\nto March 21, 1844. Those who received the Advent faith looked\nfor the coming of Christ during that year.] when our Saviour was\nexpected to appear. With solemn earnestness we sought, as a peo-\nple, to purify our lives that we might be ready to meet Him at His\ncoming. Notwithstanding the opposition of ministers and churches,\nBeethoven Hall, in the city of Portland, was nightly crowded; espe-\ncially was there a large congregation on Sundays. Elder Stockman\nwas a man of deep piety. He was in feeble health; yet when he stood\nbefore the people he seemed to be lifted above physical infirmity,\nand his face was lighted with the consciousness that he was teaching\nthe sacred truth of God.\nThere was a solemn, searching power in his words that struck\nhome to many hearts. He sometimes expressed a fervent desire to\nlive until he should welcome the Saviour coming in the clouds of\nheaven. Under his ministration the Spirit of God convicted many\nsinners and brought them into the fold of Christ. Meetings were\nstill held at private houses in different parts of the city with the best\nresults. Believers were encouraged to work for their friends and [49]\nrelatives, and conversions were multiplying day by day.\nAll classes flocked to the meetings at Beethoven Hall. Rich and\npoor, high and low, ministers and laymen, were all, from various\ncauses, anxious to hear for themselves the doctrine of the second\nadvent. Many came, who, finding no room to stand, went away\ndisappointed. The order of the meetings was simple. A short and\npointed discourse was usually given, then liberty was granted for\ngeneral exhortation. There was, as a rule, the most perfect stillness\npossible for so large a crowd. The Lord held the spirit of opposition\nin check while His servants explained the reasons of their faith.\nSometimes the instrument was feeble, but the Spirit of God gave\nweight and power to His truth. The presence of the holy angels was\n47\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfelt in the assembly, and numbers were daily added to the little band\nof believers.\nOn one occasion, while Elder Stockman was preaching, Elder\nBrown, a Christian Baptist minister, whose name has been men-\ntioned before in this narrative, was sitting in the desk listening to\nthe sermon with intense interest. He became deeply moved, and\nsuddenly his countenance grew pale as the dead, he reeled in his\nchair, and Elder Stockman caught him in his arms just as he was\nfalling to the floor, and laid him on the sofa behind the desk, where\nhe lay powerless until the discourse was finished.\nHe then arose, his face still pale, but shining with light from the\nSun of Righteousness, and gave a very impressive testimony. He\nseemed to receive holy unction from above. He was usually slow of\nspeech, with an earnest manner, entirely free from excitement. On\nthis occasion his solemn, measured words carried with them a new\npower as he warned sinners and his brother ministers to put away\nunbelief, prejudice, and cold formality, and, like the noble Bereans,\nsearch the sacred writings, comparing scripture with scripture, to\nascertain if these things were not true. He entreated the ministers[50]\npresent not to feel themselves injured by the direct and searching\nmanner in which Elder Stockman had presented the solemn subject\nthat interested all minds.\nSaid he: \u201cWe want to reach the people; we want sinners to be\nconvicted and become truly repentant before it is too late for them\nto be saved, lest they shall take up the lamentation, \u2018The harvest\nis past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.\u2019 Brethren in\nthe ministry say that our arrows hit them; will they please stand\naside from between us and the people, and let us reach the hearts\nof sinners? If they make themselves a target for our aim, they have\nno reason to complain of the wounds they receive. Stand aside,\nbrethren, and you will not get hit!\u201d\nHe related his own experience with such simplicity and can-\ndor that many who had been greatly prejudiced were affected to\ntears. The Spirit of God was felt in his words and seen upon his\ncountenance. With a holy exaltation he boldly declared that he had\ntaken the word of God as his counselor, that his doubts had been\nswept away and his faith confirmed. With earnestness he invited his\nbrother ministers, church members, sinners, and infidels to examine\nAdvent Experience 49\nthe Bible for themselves, and charged them to let no man turn them\nfrom the purpose of ascertaining what was the truth.\nElder Brown neither then nor afterward severed his connection\nwith the Christian Baptist Church, but was looked upon with great\nrespect by his people. When he had finished speaking, those who de-\nsired the prayers of the people of God were invited to rise. Hundreds\nresponded to the call. The Holy Spirit rested upon the assembly.\nHeaven and earth seemed to approach each other. The meeting lasted\nuntil a late hour of the night. The power of the Lord was felt upon\nyoung, old, and middle-aged.\nAs we returned to our homes by various ways, a voice praising\nGod would reach us from one direction, and, as if in response, voices\nfrom another and still another quarter shouted: \u201cGlory to God, the [51]\nLord reigneth!\u201d Men sought their homes with praises upon their\nlips, and the glad sound rang out upon the still night air. No one\nwho attended these meetings can ever forget those scenes of deepest\ninterest.\nThose who sincerely love Jesus can appreciate the feelings of\nthose who watched with the most intense longing for the coming\nof their Saviour. The point of expectation was nearing. The time\nwhen we hoped to meet Him was close at hand. We approached this\nhour with a calm solemnity. The true believers rested in a sweet\ncommunion with God\u2014an earnest of the peace that was to be theirs\nin the bright hereafter. None who experienced this hope and trust\ncan ever forget those precious hours of waiting.\nWorldly business was for the most part laid aside for a few weeks.\nWe carefully examined every thought and emotion of our hearts, as\nif upon our deathbeds and in a few hours to close our eyes forever\nupon earthly scenes. There was no making of \u201cascension robes\u201d for\nthe great event; we felt the need of internal evidence that we were\nprepared to meet Christ, and our white robes were purity of soul,\ncharacter cleansed from sin by the atoning blood of our Saviour.\nBut the time of expectation passed. This was the first close\ntest brought to bear upon those who believed and hoped that Jesus\nwould come in the clouds of heaven. The disappointment of God\u2019s\nwaiting people was great. The scoffers were triumphant and won\nthe weak and cowardly to their ranks. Some who had appeared\nto possess true faith seemed to have been influenced only by fear;\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand now their courage returned with the passing of the time, and\nthey boldly united with the scoffers, declaring they had never been\nduped to really believe the doctrine of Miller, who was a mad fanatic.\nOthers, naturally yielding or vacillating, quietly deserted the cause. I\nthought, If Christ had surely come, what would have become of those\nweak and changing ones? They professed to love and long for the\ncoming of Jesus; but when He failed to appear, they seemed greatly[52]\nrelieved, and went back to a state of carelessness and disregard of\ntrue religion.\nWe were perplexed and disappointed, yet did not renounce our\nfaith. Many still clung to the hope that Jesus would not long delay\nHis coming; the word of the Lord was sure, it could not fail. We felt\nthat we had done our duty, we had lived up to our precious faith;\nwe were disappointed, but not discouraged. The signs of the times\ndenoted that the end of all things was at hand; we must watch and\nhold ourselves in readiness for the coming of the Master at any time.\nWe must wait with hope and trust, not neglecting the assembling of\nourselves together for instruction, encouragement, and comfort, that\nour light might shine forth into the darkness of the world.\nCalculation of the time was so simple and plain that even children\ncould understand it. From the date of the decree of the king of Persia,\nfound in Ezra 7, which was given in 457 before Christ, the 2300\nyears of Daniel 8:14 must terminate with 1843. Accordingly we\nlooked to the end of this year for the coming of the Lord. We\nwere sadly disappointed when the year entirely passed away and the\nSaviour had not come.\nIt was not at first perceived that if the decree did not go forth\nat the beginning of the year 457 B.C., the 2300 years would not be\ncompleted at the close of 1843. But it was ascertained that the decree\nwas given near the close of the year 457 B.C., and therefore the\nprophetic period must reach to the fall of the year 1844. Therefore\nthe vision of time did not tarry, though it had seemed to do so. We\nlearned to rest upon the language of the prophet. \u201cFor the vision is\nyet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie:\nthough it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not\ntarry.\u201d\nGod tested and proved His people by the passing of the time in\n1843. The mistake made in reckoning the prophetic periods was[53]\nAdvent Experience 51\nnot at once discovered even by learned men who opposed the views\nof those who were looking for Christ\u2019s coming. Scholars declared\nthat Mr. Miller was right in his calculation of the time, though they\ndisputed him in regard to the event that would crown that period.\nBut they, and the waiting people of God, were in a common error on\nthe question of time.\nWe fully believe that God, in His wisdom, designed that His peo-\nple should meet with a disappointment, which was well calculated to\nreveal hearts and develop the true characters of those who had pro-\nfessed to look for and rejoice in the coming of the Lord. Those who\nembraced the first angel\u2019s message (see Revelation 14:6, 7) through\nfear of the wrath of God\u2019s judgments, not because they loved the\ntruth and desired an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, now\nappeared in their true light. They were among the first to ridicule the\ndisappointed ones who sincerely longed for and loved the appearing\nof Jesus.\nThose who had been disappointed were not long left in darkness;\nfor in searching the prophetic periods with earnest prayer, the error\nwas discovered, and the tracing of the prophetic pencil down through\nthe tarrying time. In the joyful expectation of the coming of Christ\nthe apparent tarrying of the vision had not been taken into account,\nand was a sad and unlooked-for surprise. Yet this very trial was\nnecessary to develop and strengthen the sincere believers in the\ntruth.\nOur hopes now centered on the coming of the Lord in 1844. This\nwas also the time for the message of the second angel, who, flying\nthrough the midst of heaven, cried: \u201cBabylon is fallen, is fallen,\nthat great city.\u201d That message was first proclaimed by the servants\nof God in the summer of 1844. As a result, many left the fallen\nchurches. In connection with this message the midnight cry [See\nMatthew 25:1-13.] was given: \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; [54]\ngo ye out to meet Him.\u201d In every part of the land, light was given\nconcerning this message, and the cry aroused thousands. It went\nfrom city to city, from village to village, and into the remote country\nregions. It reached the learned and talented, as well as the obscure\nand humble.\nThis was the happiest year of my life. My heart was full of glad\nexpectation, but I felt great pity and anxiety for those who were in\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndiscouragement and had no hope in Jesus. We united, as a people, in\nearnest prayer for a true experience and the unmistakable evidence\nof our acceptance with God.\nWe needed great patience, for the scoffers were many. We were\nfrequently greeted by scornful references to our former disappoint-\nment. \u201cYou have not gone up yet; when do you expect to go up?\u201d\nand similar taunts were often vented upon us by our worldly ac-\nquaintances, and even by some professed Christians who accepted\nthe Bible, yet failed to learn its great and important truths. Their\nblinded eyes seemed to see but a vague and distant meaning in the\nsolemn warning, God \u201chath appointed a day, in the which He will\njudge the world,\u201d and in the assurance that the saints will be caught\nup together to meet the Lord in the air.\nThe orthodox churches used every means to prevent the belief in\nChrist\u2019s soon coming from spreading. No liberty was granted in their\nmeetings to those who dared mention a hope of the soon coming\nof Christ. Professed lovers of Jesus scornfully rejected the tidings\nthat He whom they claimed as their best friend was soon to visit\nthem. They were excited and angered against those who proclaimed\nthe news of His coming, and who rejoiced that they should speedily\nbehold Him in His glory.\nEvery moment seemed to me of the utmost importance. I felt\nthat we were doing work for eternity and that the careless and unin-\nterested were in the greatest peril. My faith was unclouded, and I[55]\nappropriated to myself the precious promises of Jesus. He had said\nto His disciples: \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive.\u201d I firmly believed that\nwhatever I asked in accordance with the will of God would certainly\nbe granted to me. I sank in humility at the feet of Jesus, with my\nheart in harmony with His will.\nI often visited families and engaged in earnest prayer with those\nwho were oppressed by fears and despondency. My faith was so\nstrong that I never doubted for a moment that God would answer\nmy prayers, and without a single exception the blessing and peace\nof Jesus rested upon us in answer to our humble petitions, and the\nhearts of the despairing ones were made joyful by light and hope.\nWith diligent searching of heart and humble confessions we\ncame prayerfully up to the time of expectation. Every morning we\nfelt that it was our first work to secure the evidence that our lives\nAdvent Experience 53\nwere right before God. Our interest for one another increased; we\nprayed much with and for one another. We assembled in the orchards\nand groves to commune with God and to offer up our petitions to\nHim, feeling more fully in His presence when surrounded by His\nnatural works. The joys of salvation were more necessary to us than\nour food and drink. If clouds obscured our minds, we dared not\nrest or sleep till they were swept away by the consciousness of our\nacceptance with the Lord.\nMy health was very poor, my lungs were seriously affected,\nand my voice failed. The Spirit of God often rested upon me with\ngreat power, and my frail body could scarcely endure the glory that\nflooded my soul. I seemed to breathe in the atmosphere of heaven,\nand rejoiced in the prospect of soon meeting my Redeemer and\nliving forever in the light of His countenance.\nThe waiting people of God approached the hour when they fondly\nhoped their joys would be complete in the coming of the Saviour. [56]\nBut the time again passed unmarked by the advent of Jesus. It was\nhard to take up the cares of life that we thought had been laid down\nforever. It was a bitter disappointment that fell upon the little flock\nwhose faith had been so strong and whose hope had been so high.\nBut we were surprised that we felt so free in the Lord and were so\nstrongly sustained by His strength and grace.\nThe experience of the former year was, however, repeated to a\ngreater extent. A large class renounced their faith. Some, who had\nbeen very confident, were so deeply wounded in their pride that they\nfelt like fleeing from the world. Like Jonah, they complained of God,\nand chose death rather than life. Those who had built their faith upon\nthe evidence of others, and not upon the word of God, were now as\nready to again change their views. The hypocrites, who had hoped\nto deceive the Lord as well as themselves with their counterfeit\npenitence and devotion, now felt relieved from impending danger,\nand openly opposed the cause they had lately professed to love.\nThe weak and the wicked united in declaring that there could be\nno more fears or expectations now. The time had passed, the Lord\nhad not come, and the world would remain the same for thousands of\nyears. This second great test revealed a mass of worthless drift that\nhad been drawn into the strong current of the advent faith, and been\nborne along for a time with the true believers and earnest workers.\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWe were disappointed, but not disheartened. We resolved to\nsubmit patiently to the process of purifying that God deemed needful\nfor us, and to wait with patient hope for the Saviour to redeem His\ntried and faithful ones.\nWe were firm in the belief that the preaching of definite time\nwas of God. It was this that led men to search the Bible diligently,\ndiscovering truths they had not before perceived. Jonah was sent\nof God to proclaim in the streets of Nineveh that within forty days\nthe city would be overthrown; but God accepted the humiliation[57]\nof the Ninevites and extended their period of probation. Yet the\nmessage that Jonah brought was sent of God, and Nineveh was\ntested according to His will. The world looked upon our hope as a\ndelusion, and our disappointment as its consequent failure.\nThe words of the Saviour in the parable of the wicked servant\napply very forcibly to those who ridicule the near coming of the Son\nof man: \u201cBut and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord\ndelayeth His coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants,\nand to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall\ncome in a day when he looketh not for Him, and in an hour that he is\nnot aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion\nwith the hypocrites.\u201d\nWe found everywhere the scoffers whom Peter said should come\nin the last days, walking after their own lusts, and saying: \u201cWhere\nis the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all\nthings continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\u201d But\nthose who had looked for the coming of the Lord were not without\ncomfort. They had obtained valuable knowledge in the searching of\nthe word. The plan of salvation was plainer to their understanding.\nEvery day they discovered new beauties in the sacred pages, and a\nwonderful harmony running through all, one scripture explaining\nanother, and no word used in vain.\nOur disappointment was not so great as that of the disciples.\nWhen the Son of man rode triumphantly into Jerusalem, they ex-\npected Him to be crowned king. The people flocked from all the\nregion about, and cried: \u201cHosanna to the Son of David.\u201d And when\nthe priests and elders besought Jesus to still the multitude, He de-\nclared that if they should hold their peace even the stones would cry\nout, for prophecy must be fulfilled. Yet in a few days these very\nAdvent Experience 55\ndisciples saw their beloved Master, whom they believed would reign\non David\u2019s throne, stretched upon the cruel cross above the mocking, [58]\ntaunting Pharisees. Their high hopes were disappointed, and the\ndarkness of death closed about them.\nYet Christ was true to His promises. Sweet was the consolation\nHe gave His people, rich the reward of the true and faithful.\nMr. Miller and those who were in union with him supposed\nthat the cleansing of the sanctuary spoken of in Daniel 8:14 meant\nthe purifying of the earth by fire prior to its becoming the abode of\nthe saints. This was to take place at the advent of Christ; therefore\nwe looked for that event at the end of the 2300 days, or years. But\nafter our disappointment the Scriptures were carefully searched with\nprayer and earnest thought, and after a period of suspense, light\npoured in upon our darkness; doubt and uncertainty were swept\naway.\nInstead of the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 referring to the purifying\nof the earth, it was now plain that it pointed to the closing work of\nour High Priest in heaven, the finishing of the atonement, and the\npreparing of the people to abide the day of His coming.\n* * * * *\nChapter 7\u2014My First Vision\nIt was not long after the passing of the time in 1844 that my first\nvision was given me. I was visiting a dear sister in Christ, whose\nheart was knit with mine; five of us, all women, were kneeling\nquietly at the family altar. While we were praying, the power of\nGod came upon me as I had never felt it before. I seemed to be\nsurrounded with light, and to be rising higher and higher from the\nearth. I turned to look for the advent people in the world, but could\nnot find them, when a voice said to me: \u201cLook again, and look a\nlittle higher.\u201d At this I raised my eyes and saw a straight and narrow[59]\npath, cast up high above the world. On this path the advent people\nwere traveling toward the city. Behind them, at the beginning of the\npath, was a bright light which an angel told me was the midnight cry.\nThis light shone all along the path, that their feet might not stumble.\nJesus Himself went just before His people to lead them forward, and\nas long as they kept their eyes fixed on Him, they were safe. But\nsoon some grew weary, and said the city was a great way off, and\nthey expected to have entered it before. Then Jesus would encourage\nthem by raising His glorious right arm, from which came a light that\nwaved over the advent band; and they shouted: \u201cAlleluia!\u201d Others\nrashly denied the light behind them, and said it was not God that\nhad led them out so far. The light behind them went out, leaving\ntheir feet in perfect darkness, and they stumbled and lost sight of\nthe mark and of Jesus, and fell off the path down into the dark and\nwicked world below.\nSoon we heard the voice of God like many waters, which gave\nus the day and hour of Jesus\u2019 coming. The living saints, 144,000 in\nnumber, knew and understood the voice, while the wicked thought\nit was thunder and an earthquake. When God spake the time, He\npoured upon us the Holy Spirit, and our faces began to light up and\nshine with the glory of God, as Moses\u2019 did when he came down\nfrom Mount Sinai.\n56\nMy First Vision 57\nThe 144,000 were all sealed and perfectly united. On their\nforeheads were the words God, New Jerusalem, and a glorious star\ncontaining Jesus\u2019 new name. At our happy, holy state the wicked\nwere enraged, and would rush violently up to lay hands on us to\nthrust us into prison, when we would stretch forth the hand in the\nname of the Lord, and they would fall helpless to the ground. Then\nit was that the synagogue of Satan knew that God had loved us, who\ncould wash one another\u2019s feet, and salute the brethren with a holy\nkiss, and they worshiped at our feet.\nSoon our eyes were drawn to the east, for a small black cloud [60]\nhad appeared, about half as large as a man\u2019s hand, which we all\nknew was the sign of the Son of man. In solemn silence we all\ngazed on the cloud as it drew nearer, and became lighter, glorious,\nand still more glorious, till it was a great white cloud. The bottom\nappeared like fire; a rainbow was over the cloud, while around it\nwere ten thousand angels, singing a most lovely song; and upon it\nsat the Son of man. His hair was white and curly and lay on His\nshoulders, and upon His head were many crowns. His feet had the\nappearance of fire; in His right hand was a sharp sickle, in His left a\nsilver trumpet. His eyes were as a flame of fire, which searched His\nchildren through and through.\nThen all faces gathered paleness, and those that God had rejected\ngathered blackness. Then we all cried out: \u201cWho shall be able to\nstand? Is my robe spotless?\u201d The angels ceased to sing, and there\nwas a time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke: \u201cThose who have\nclean hands and pure hearts shall be able to stand; My grace is\nsufficient for you.\u201d At this, our faces lighted up, and joy filled every\nheart. And the angels struck a note higher and sang again, while\nthe cloud drew still nearer the earth. Then Jesus\u2019 silver trumpet\nsounded, as He descended on the cloud, wrapped in flames of fire.\nHe gazed on the graves of the sleeping saints, then raised His eyes\nand hands to heaven, and cried: \u201cAwake! Awake! Awake! ye that\nsleep in the dust, and arise.\u201d Then there was a mighty earthquake.\nThe graves opened, and the dead came up clothed with immortality.\nThe 144,000 shouted, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d as they recognized their friends\nwho had been torn from them by death, and in the same moment we\nwere changed, and caught up together with them to meet the Lord in\nthe air.\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWe all entered the cloud together, and were seven days ascending\nto the sea of glass, when Jesus brought the crowns, and with His[61]\nown right hand placed them on our heads. He gave us harps of gold\nand palms of victory. Here on the sea of glass the 144,000 stood in\na perfect square. Some had very bright crowns, others not so bright.\nSome crowns appeared heavy with stars, while others had but few.\nAll were perfectly satisfied with their crowns. And they were all\nclothed with a glorious white mantle from their shoulders to their\nfeet. Angels were all about us as we marched over the sea of glass\nto the gate of the city. Jesus raised His mighty, glorious arm, laid\nhold of the pearly gate, swung it back on its glittering hinges, and\nsaid to us: \u201cYou have washed your robes in My blood, stood stiffly\nfor My truth, enter in.\u201d We all marched in and felt we had a perfect\nright there.\nWithin the city we saw the tree of life and the throne of God.\nOut of the throne came a pure river of water, and on either side of\nthe river was the tree of life. On one side of the river was a trunk\nof a tree, and a trunk on the other side of the river, both of pure,\ntransparent gold. At first I thought I saw two trees; I looked again,\nand saw that they were united at the top in one tree. So it was the\ntree of life on either side of the river of life. Its branches bowed to\nthe place where we stood; and the fruit was glorious, which looked\nlike gold mixed with silver.\nWe all went under the tree, and sat down to look at the glory of\nthe place, when Brethren Fitch and Stockman, who had preached\nthe gospel of the kingdom, and whom God had laid in the grave to\nsave them, came up to us, and asked us what we had passed through\nwhile they were sleeping. We tried to call up our greatest trials, but\nthey looked so small compared with the far more exceeding and\neternal weight of glory that surrounded us, that we could not speak\nthem out, and we all cried out, \u201cAlleluia! Heaven is cheap enough,\u201d\nand we touched our golden harps and made heaven\u2019s arches ring.\nChapter 8\u2014Call to Travel [62]\nI related this vision to the believers in Portland, who had full\nconfidence that it was from God. The Spirit of the Lord attended\nthe testimony, and the solemnity of eternity rested upon us. An\nunspeakable awe filled me, that I, so young and feeble, should be\nchosen as the instrument by which God would give light to His\npeople. While under the power of the Lord I was filled with joy,\nseeming to be surrounded by holy angels in the glorious courts of\nheaven, where all is peace and gladness, and it was a sad and bitter\nchange to wake up to the realities of mortal life.\nIn a second vision, which soon followed the first, I was shown\nthe trials through which I must pass, and that it was my duty to go\nand relate to others what God had revealed to me. It was shown\nme that my labors would meet with great opposition, and that my\nheart would be rent with anguish, but that the grace of God would\nbe sufficient to sustain me through all. The teaching of this vision\ntroubled me exceedingly, for it pointed out my duty to go out among\nthe people and present the truth.\nMy health was so poor that I was in constant bodily suffering,\nand, to all appearance, had but a short time to live. I was but seven-\nteen years of age, small and frail, unused to society, and naturally\nso timid and retiring that it was painful for me to meet strangers.\nI prayed earnestly for several days, and far into the night, that this\nburden might be removed from me and laid upon someone more\ncapable of bearing it. But the light of duty did not change, and the\nwords of the angel sounded continually in my ears: \u201cMake known\nto others what I have revealed to you.\u201d\nI was unreconciled to going out into the world, and dreaded to [63]\nmeet its sneers and opposition. I had little self-confidence. Hitherto\nwhen the Spirit of God had urged me to duty, I had risen above\nmyself, forgetting all fear and timidity in the thought of Jesus\u2019 love\nand the wonderful work He had done for me. The constant assurance\nthat I was fulfilling my duty and obeying the will of the Lord gave\n59\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nme a confidence that surprised me. At such times I felt willing to do\nor suffer anything in order to help others into the light and peace of\nJesus.\nBut it seemed impossible for me to perform this work that was\npresented before me; to attempt it seemed certain failure. The trials\nattending it appeared more than I could endure. How could I, a child\nin years, go forth from place to place, unfolding to the people the\nholy truths of God? My heart shrank in terror from the thought. My\nbrother Robert, but two years older than myself, could not accom-\npany me, for he was feeble in health and his timidity greater than\nmine; nothing could have induced him to take such a step. My father\nhad a family to support, and could not leave his business; but he\nassured me that if God had called me to labor in other places, He\nwould not fail to open the way for me. But these words of encour-\nagement brought little comfort to my desponding heart; the path\nbefore me seemed hedged in with difficulties that I was unable to\novercome.\nI coveted death as a release from the responsibilities that were\ncrowding upon me. At length the sweet peace I had so long enjoyed\nleft me, and despair again pressed upon my soul. My prayers all\nseemed vain, and my faith was gone. Words of comfort, reproof, or\nencouragement were alike to me; for it seemed that no one could\nunderstand me but God, and He had forsaken me. The company of\nbelievers in Portland were ignorant concerning the exercises of my\nmind that had brought me into this state of despondency; but they\nknew that for some reason my mind had become depressed, and they\nfelt that this was sinful on my part, considering the gracious manner[64]\nin which the Lord had manifested Himself to me.\nI feared that God had taken His favor from me forever. As I\nthought of the light that had formerly blessed my soul, it seemed\ndoubly precious in contrast with the darkness that now enveloped\nme. Meetings were held at my father\u2019s house, but my distress of\nmind was so great that I did not attend them for some time. My\nburden grew heavier until the agony of my spirit seemed more than\nI could bear.\nAt length I was induced to be present at one of the meetings in\nmy own home. The church made my case a special subject of prayer.\nFather Pearson, who in my earlier experience had opposed the man-\nCall to Travel 61\nifestations of the power of God upon me, now prayed earnestly for\nme, and counseled me to surrender my will to the will of the Lord.\nLike a tender father he tried to encourage and comfort me, bidding\nme believe I was not forsaken by the Friend of sinners.\nI felt too weak and despondent to make any special effort for\nmyself, but my heart united with the petitions of my friends. I\ncared little now for the opposition of the world, and felt willing to\nmake every sacrifice if only the favor of God might be restored to\nme. While prayer was offered for me, the thick darkness that had\nencompassed me rolled back, and a sudden light came upon me.\nMy strength was taken away. I seemed to be in the presence of the\nangels. One of these holy beings again repeated the words: \u201cMake\nknown to others what I have revealed to you.\u201d\nOne great fear that oppressed me was that if I obeyed the call of\nduty, and went out declaring myself to be one favored of the Most\nHigh with visions and revelations for the people, I might yield to\nsinful exaltation and be lifted above the station that was right for\nme to occupy, bring upon myself the displeasure of God, and lose\nmy own soul. I had before me several cases such as I have here\ndescribed, and my heart shrank from the trying ordeal.\nI now entreated that if I must go and relate what the Lord had [65]\nshown me, I should be preserved from undue exaltation. Said the\nangel: \u201cYour prayers are heard and shall be answered. If this evil\nthat you dread threatens you, the hand of God will be stretched out\nto save you; by affliction He will draw you to Himself and preserve\nyour humility. Deliver the message faithfully. Endure unto the end,\nand you shall eat the fruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of\nlife.\u201d\nAfter recovering consciousness of earthly things, I committed\nmyself to the Lord, ready to do His bidding whatever that might be.\nProvidentially, the way opened for me to go with my brother-in-law\nto my sisters in Poland, thirty miles from my home. I there had an\nopportunity to bear my testimony.\nFor three months my throat and lungs had been so diseased\nthat I could talk but little, and that in a low and husky tone. On\nthis occasion I stood up in meeting and commenced speaking in a\nwhisper. I continued thus for about five minutes, when the soreness\nand obstruction left my throat and lungs, my voice became clear and\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nstrong, and I spoke with perfect ease and freedom for nearly two\nhours. When my message was ended, my voice was gone until I\nagain stood before the people, when the same singular restoration\nwas repeated. I felt a constant assurance that I was doing the will of\nGod, and saw marked results attending my efforts.\nThe way providentially opened for me to go to the eastern part of\nMaine. Brother William Jordan was going on business to Orrington,\naccompanied by his sister, and I was urged to go with them. As I\nhad promised the Lord to walk in the path He opened before me, I\ndared not refuse. At Orrington I met Elder James White. He was\nacquainted with my friends, and was himself engaged in the work\nof salvation.\nThe Spirit of God attended the message I bore; hearts were\nmade glad in the truth, and the desponding ones were cheered and[66]\nencouraged to renew their faith. At Garland a large number collected\nfrom different quarters to hear my message. But my heart was very\nheavy; I had just received a letter from my mother begging me to\nreturn home, for false reports were circulating concerning me. This\nwas an unexpected blow. My name had always been free from the\nshadow of reproach, and my reputation was very dear to me. I also\nfelt grieved that my mother should suffer on my account; her heart\nwas bound up in her children, and she was very sensitive in regard\nto them. If there had been an opportunity, I should have set out for\nhome immediately; but this was impossible.\nMy sorrow was so great that I felt too depressed to speak that\nnight. My friends urged me to trust in the Lord; and at length the\nbrethren engaged in prayer for me. The blessing of the Lord soon\nrested upon me, and I bore my testimony that evening with great\nfreedom. There seemed to be an angel standing by my side to\nstrengthen me. Shouts of glory and victory went up from that house,\nand the presence of Jesus was felt among us.\nIn my labors I was called to oppose the course of some who\nby their fanaticism were bringing reproach upon the cause of God.\nThese fanatical ones seemed to think that religion consisted in great\nexcitement and noise. They would talk in a manner that would\nirritate unbelievers, and cause them to hate them and the doctrines\nthey taught; then they would rejoice that they suffered persecution.\nUnbelievers could see no consistency in their course. The brethren\nCall to Travel 63\nin some places were prevented from assembling for meetings. The\ninnocent suffered with the guilty. I carried a sad and heavy heart\nmuch of the time. It seemed cruel that the cause of Christ should\nbe injured by the course of these injudicious men. They were not\nonly ruining their own souls, but placing upon the cause a stigma\nnot easily removed. And Satan loved to have it so. It suited him well\nto see the truth handled by unsanctified men; to have it mixed with [67]\nerror, and then all together trampled in the dust. He looked with\ntriumph upon the confused, scattered state of God\u2019s children.\nOne of these fanatical persons labored with some success to\nturn my friends and even my relatives against me. Because I had\nfaithfully related that which was shown me respecting his unchristian\ncourse, he circulated falsehoods to destroy my influence and to\njustify himself. My lot seemed hard. Discouragements pressed\nheavily upon me; and the condition of God\u2019s people so filled me\nwith anguish that for two weeks I was prostrated with sickness.\nMy friends thought I could not live; but brethren and sisters who\nsympathized with me in this affliction met to pray for me. I soon\nrealized that earnest, effectual prayer was offered in my behalf.\nPrayer prevailed. The power of the strong foe was broken, and I was\nreleased, and immediately taken off in vision. In this view I saw that\nif I felt a human influence affecting my testimony, no matter where I\nmight be, I had only to cry to God, and an angel would be sent to my\nrescue. I already had one guardian angel attending me continually,\nbut when necessary, the Lord would send another to raise me above\nthe power of every earthly influence.\n* * * * *\nChapter 9\u2014Vision of the New Earth\n[This vision describes events to take place at the close of the one\nthousand years after Christ\u2019s second advent. Revelation 20; 21; 22;\nZechariah 14:4.]\nWith Jesus at our head, we all descended from the city down to\nthis earth, on a great and mighty mountain, which could not bear\nJesus up, and it parted asunder, and there was a mighty plain. Then[68]\nwe looked up and saw the great city, with twelve foundations, and\ntwelve gates, three on each side, and an angel at each gate. We all\ncried out: \u201cThe city, the great city, it\u2019s coming, it\u2019s coming down\nfrom God out of heaven,\u201d and it came and settled on the place where\nwe stood. Then we began to look at the glorious things outside of\nthe city. There I saw most beautiful houses, that had the appearance\nof silver, supported by four pillars set with pearls, most glorious to\nbehold, which were to be inhabited by the saints, and in which was\na golden shelf. I saw many of the saints go into the houses, take off\ntheir glittering crowns and lay them on the shelf, then go out into the\nfield by the houses to do something with the earth; not as we have to\ndo with the earth here; no, no. A glorious light shone all about their\nheads, and they were continually offering praise to God.\nAnd I saw another field full of all kinds of flowers, and as I\nplucked them, I cried out: \u201cThey will never fade.\u201d Next I saw a field\nof tall grass, most glorious to behold; it was living green, and had a\nreflection of silver and gold, as it waved proudly to the glory of King\nJesus. Then we entered a field full of all kinds of beasts\u2014the lion,\nthe lamb, the leopard, and the wolf, all together in perfect union. We\npassed through the midst of them, and they followed on peaceably\nafter. Then we entered a wood, not like the dark woods we have\nhere; no, no; but light, and all over glorious; the branches of the\ntrees waved to and fro, and we all cried out: \u201cWe will dwell safely\nin the wilderness and sleep in the woods.\u201d We passed through the\nwoods, for we were on our way to Mount Zion.\n64\nVision of the New Earth 65\nAs we were traveling along, we met a company who were also\ngazing at the glories of the place. I noticed red as a border on their\ngarments; their crowns were brilliant; their robes were pure white.\nAs we greeted them, I asked Jesus who they were. He said they were\nmartyrs that had been slain for Him. With them was an innumerable [69]\ncompany of little ones; they had a hem of red on their garments also.\nMount Zion was just before us, and on the mount was a glorious\ntemple, and about it were seven other mountains, on which grew\nroses and lilies. And I saw the little ones climb, or, if they chose, use\ntheir little wings and fly to the top of the mountains, and pluck the\nnever-fading flowers. There were all kinds of trees around the temple\nto beautify the place\u2014the box, the pine, the fir, the oil, the myrtle,\nthe pomegranate, and the fig tree bowed down with the weight of its\ntimely figs; these made the place all over glorious. And as we were\nabout to enter the temple, Jesus raised His lovely voice and said,\n\u201cOnly the 144,000 enter this place,\u201d and we shouted, \u201cAlleluia!\u201d\nThis temple was supported by seven pillars, all of transparent\ngold, set with pearls most glorious. The wonderful things I there saw,\nI cannot describe. Oh, that I could talk in the language of Canaan,\nthen could I tell a little of the glory of the better world. I saw there\ntables of stone in which the names of the 144,000 were engraved in\nletters of gold.\nAfter beholding the glory of the temple, we went out, and Jesus\nleft us and went to the city. Soon we heard His lovely voice again,\nsaying: \u201cCome, My people, you have come out of great tribulation,\nand done My will, suffered for Me, come in to supper; for I will gird\nMyself and serve you.\u201d We shouted, \u201cAlleluia, glory,\u201d and entered\nthe city. Here I saw a table of pure silver; it was many miles in\nlength, yet our eyes could extend over it. I saw the fruit of the tree\nof life, the manna, almonds, figs, pomegranates, grapes, and many\nother kinds of fruit. I asked Jesus to let me eat of the fruit. He said:\n\u201cNot now. Those who eat of the fruit of this land, go back to earth\nno more. But in a little while, if faithful, you shall both eat of the\nfruit of the tree of life and drink of the water of the fountain. And,\u201d\nsaid He, \u201cyou must go back to the earth again, and relate to others [70]\nwhat I have revealed to you.\u201d Then an angel bore me gently down\nto this dark world. Sometimes I think I can stay here no longer, all\nthings of earth look so dreary. I feel very lonely here, for I have seen\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\na better land. Oh that I had wings like a dove, then would I fly away\nand be at rest.\nBrother Hyde, who was present during this vision, composed the\nfollowing verses, which have gone the rounds of the religious papers,\nand have found a place in several hymn-books. Those who have pub-\nlished, read, and sung them have little thought that they originated\nfrom a vision of a girl persecuted for her humble testimony.\nWe have heard from the bright, the holy land;\nWe have heard, and our hearts are glad;\nFor we were a lonely pilgrim band,\nAnd weary, and worn, and sad.\nThey tell us the saints have a dwelling there\u2014\nNo longer are homeless ones;\nAnd we know that the goodly land is fair,\nWhere life\u2019s pure river runs.\nThey say green fields are waving there,\nThat never a blight shall know;\nAnd the deserts wild are blooming fair,\nAnd the roses of Sharon grow.\nThere are lovely birds in the bowers green,\nTheir songs are blithe and sweet;\nAnd their warblings, gushing ever new,\nThe angels\u2019 harpings greet.\nWe have heard of the palms, the robes, the crowns,\nAnd the silvery band in white;\nOf the city fair, with pearly gates,\nAll radiant with light.\nWe have heard of the angels there, and saints,\nWith their harps of gold, how they sing;\nOf the mount, with the fruitful tree of life,\nOf the leaves that healing bring.\nThe King of that country, He is fair,\nHe\u2019s the joy and light of the place;\nIn His beauty we shall behold Him there,\nVision of the New Earth 67\nAnd bask in His smiling face.\nWe\u2019ll be there, we\u2019ll be there in a little while, [71]\nWe\u2019ll join the pure and the blest;\nWe\u2019ll have the palm, the robe, the crown,\nAnd forever be at rest.\n* * * * *\nChapter 10\u2014Withholding Reproof\nAbout this time I was subjected to a severe trial. If the Spirit\nof God rested upon anyone in meeting, and he glorified God by\npraising Him, some raised the cry of mesmerism; and if it pleased\nthe Lord to give me a vision in meeting, some would say that it was\nthe effect of excitement and mesmerism. Grieved and desponding, I\noften went alone to some retired place to pour out my soul before\nHim who invites the weary and heavy-laden to come and find rest.\nAs my faith claimed the promises, Jesus would seem very near. The\nsweet light of heaven would shine around me, and I would seem to\nbe encircled by the arms of my Saviour, and would there be taken\noff in vision. But when I would relate what God had revealed to me\nalone, where no earthly influence could affect me, I was grieved and\nastonished to hear some intimate that those who lived nearest to God\nwere most liable to be deceived by Satan.\nAccording to this teaching, our only safety from delusion would\nbe to remain at a distance from God, in a backslidden state. Oh,\nthought I, has it come to this, that those who honestly go to God\nalone to plead His promises, and to claim His salvation, are to be\ncharged with being under the foul influence of mesmerism? Do we\nask our kind Father in heaven for bread, only to receive a stone or a\nscorpion? These things wounded my spirit, and wrung my soul with\nkeen anguish, well nigh to despair. Many would have me believe\nthat there was no Holy Spirit, and that all the exercises that holy\nmen of God experienced were only the effect of mesmerism or the[72]\ndeception of Satan.\nSome had taken extreme views of certain texts of scripture,\nrefraining wholly from labor, and rejecting all those who would not\nreceive their ideas on this and other points pertaining to religious\nduty. God revealed these errors to me in vision, and sent me to\ninstruct His erring children; but many of them wholly rejected the\nmessage, and charged me with conforming to the world. On the\nother hand, the nominal Adventists charged me with fanaticism, and\n68\nWithholding Reproof 69\nI was falsely represented as the leader of the fanaticism which I was\nlaboring constantly to arrest.\nDifferent times were set for the Lord to come, and were urged\nupon the brethren. But the Lord showed me that they would pass by,\nfor the time of trouble must take place before the coming of Christ,\nand that every time that was set, and passed, would weaken the faith\nof God\u2019s people. For this I was charged with being the evil servant\nthat said: \u201cMy Lord delayeth His coming.\u201d\nThese statements relative to time setting were printed about\nthirty years ago, and the books containing them have been circulated\neverywhere; yet some ministers claiming to be well acquainted with\nme, state that I have set time after time for the Lord to come, and\nthose times have passed, therefore my visions are false. No doubt\nthese false statements are received by many as truth; but none who\nare acquainted with me or with my labors can in candor make such\nreport. This is the testimony I have ever borne since the passing\nof the time in 1844: \u201cTime after time will be set by different ones,\nand will pass by; and the influence of this time setting will tend to\ndestroy the faith of God\u2019s people.\u201d If I had in vision seen definite\ntime, and had borne my testimony to it, I could not have written and\npublished, in the face of this testimony, that all times that should\nbe set would pass, for the time of trouble must come before the\ncoming of Christ. Certainly for the last thirty years, that is, since the [73]\npublication of this statement, I would not be inclined to set time for\nChrist to come, and thus place myself under the same condemnation\nwith those whom I was reproving. And I had no vision until 1845,\nwhich was after the passing of the time of general expectation in\n1844. I was then shown what I have here stated.\nAnd has not this testimony been fulfilled in every particular? The\nFirst-day Adventists have set time after time, and notwithstanding\nthe repeated failures, they have gathered courage to set new times.\nGod has not led them in this. Many of them have rejected the true\nprophetic time, and ignored the fulfillment of prophecy, because the\ntime passed in 1844, and did not bring the expected event. They\nrejected the truth, and the enemy has had power to bring strong\ndelusions upon them that they should believe a lie. The great test\non time was in 1843 and 1844; and all who have set time since then\nhave been deceiving themselves and deceiving others.\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nUp to the time of my first vision I could not write; my trembling\nhand was unable to hold my pen steadily. While in vision, I was\ncommanded by an angel to write the vision. I obeyed, and wrote\nreadily. My nerves were strengthened, and my hand became steady.\nIt was a great cross for me to relate to the erring what had been\nshown me concerning them. It caused me great distress to see others\ntroubled or grieved. And when obliged to declare the messages, I\nwould often soften them down, and make them appear as favorable\nfor the individual as I could, and then would go by myself and weep\nin agony of spirit. I looked upon those who had only their own\nsouls to care for, and thought if I were in their condition I would not\nmurmur. It was hard to relate the plain, cutting testimonies given me\nof God. I anxiously watched the result, and if the persons reproved\nrose up against the reproof, and afterward opposed the truth, these[74]\nqueries would arise in my mind: Did I deliver the message just as\nI should? Could there not have been some way to save them? And\nthen such distress pressed upon my soul that I often felt that death\nwould be a welcome messenger, and the grave a sweet resting place.\nI did not realize the danger and sin of such a course, until in\nvision I was taken into the presence of Jesus. He looked upon me\nwith a frown, and turned His face from me. It is not possible to\ndescribe the terror and agony I then felt. I fell upon my face before\nHim, but had no power to utter a word. Oh, how I longed to be\ncovered and hid from that dreadful frown! Then could I realize, in\nsome degree, what the feelings of the lost will be when they cry:\n\u201cMountains and rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of Him\nthat sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.\u201d\nPresently an angel bade me rise, and the sight that met my eyes\ncan hardly be described. Before me was a company whose hair and\ngarments were torn, and whose countenances were the very picture\nof despair and horror. They came close to me, and rubbed their\ngarments upon mine. As I looked at my garments, I saw that they\nwere stained with blood. Again I fell like one dead at the feet of my\naccompanying angel. I could not plead one excuse, and longed to\nbe away from that holy place. The angel raised me to my feet, and\nsaid: \u201cThis is not your case now, but this scene has passed before\nyou to let you know what your situation must be if you neglect to\ndeclare to others what the Lord has revealed to you. But if you are\nWithholding Reproof 71\nfaithful to the end, you shall eat of the tree of life, and shall drink of\nthe river of the water of life. You will have to suffer much, but the\ngrace of God is sufficient.\u201d I then felt willing to do all that the Lord\nmight require me to do, that I might have His approbation, and not\nfeel His dreadful frown.\nChapter 11\u2014Marriage and Subsequent Labors[75]\nAugust 30, 1846, I was united in marriage to Elder James White.\nElder White had enjoyed a deep experience in the advent movement,\nand his labors in proclaiming the truth had been blessed of God. Our\nhearts were united in the great work, and together we traveled and\nlabored for the salvation of souls.\nWe entered upon our work penniless, with few friends, and\nbroken in health. My husband had inherited a powerful constitution,\nbut his health had been seriously impaired by close application to\nstudy at school, and in lecturing. I had suffered ill-health from a\nchild, as I have related. In this condition, without means, with very\nfew who sympathized with us in our views, without a paper, and\nwithout books, we entered upon our work. We had no houses of\nworship at that time. And the idea of using a tent had not then\noccurred to us. Most of our meetings were held in private houses.\nOur congregations were small. It was seldom that any came into\nour meetings excepting Adventists, unless they were attracted by\ncuriosity to hear a woman speak.\nAt first I moved out timidly in the work of public speaking. If\nI had confidence, it was given me by the Holy Spirit. If I spoke\nwith freedom and power, it was given me of God. Our meetings\nwere usually conducted in such a manner that both of us took part.\nMy husband would give a doctrinal discourse, then I would follow\nwith an exhortation of considerable length, melting my way into the\nfeelings of the congregation. Thus my husband sowed and I watered\nthe seed of truth, and God did give the increase.\nIn the autumn of 1846 we began to observe the Bible Sabbath,\nand to teach and defend it. My attention was first called to the[76]\nSabbath while I was on a visit to New Bedford, Massachusetts,\nearlier in the same year. I there became acquainted with Elder Joseph\nBates, who had early embraced the advent faith, and was an active\nlaborer in the cause. Elder B. was keeping the Sabbath, and urged its\nimportance. I did not feel its importance, and thought that Elder B.\n72\nMarriage and Subsequent Labors 73\nerred in dwelling upon the fourth commandment more than upon the\nother nine. But the Lord gave me a view of the heavenly sanctuary.\nThe temple of God was opened in heaven, and I was shown the ark\nof God covered with the mercy seat. Two angels stood, one at each\nend of the ark, with their wings spread over the mercy seat, and their\nfaces turned toward it. My accompanying angel informed me that\nthese represented all the heavenly host looking with reverential awe\ntoward the holy law which had been written by the finger of God.\nJesus raised the cover of the ark, and I beheld the tables of stone on\nwhich the Ten Commandments were written. I was amazed as I saw\nthe fourth commandment in the very center of the ten precepts, with\na soft halo of light encircling it. Said the angel: \u201cIt is the only one\nof the ten which defines the living God who created the heavens and\nthe earth and all things that are therein. When the foundations of the\nearth were laid, then was laid the foundation of the Sabbath also.\u201d\nI was shown that if the true Sabbath had always been kept, there\nwould never have been an infidel or an atheist. The observance of the\nSabbath would have preserved the world from idolatry. The fourth\ncommandment has been trampled upon; therefore we are called\nupon to repair the breach in the law, and plead for the downtrodden\nSabbath. The man of sin, who exalted himself above God, and\nthought to change times and laws, brought about the change of the\nSabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week. In doing this,\nhe made a breach in the law of God. Just prior to the great day\nof God, a message is sent forth to warn the people to come back\nto their allegiance to the law of God which antichrist has broken [77]\ndown. By precept and example, attention must be called to the\nbreach in the law. I was shown that the third angel, proclaiming\nthe commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, represents the\npeople who receive this message and raise the voice of warning to\nthe world, to keep the commandments of God as the apple of the\neye, and that in response to this warning many would embrace the\nSabbath of the Lord.\nWhen we received the light upon the fourth commandment,\nthere were about twenty-five Adventists in Maine who observed the\nSabbath; but these were so diverse in sentiment upon other points\nof doctrine, and so scattered in location, that their influence was\nvery small. There was about the same number, in similar condition,\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin other parts of New England. It seemed to be our duty to visit\nthese frequently at their homes, and strengthen them in the Lord and\nin His truth, and as they were so much scattered, it was necessary\nfor us to be on the road much of the time. For want of means we\ntook the cheapest private conveyance, second-class cars, and lower-\ndeck passage on steamers. In my feeble condition I found traveling\nby private conveyance most comfortable. When on second-class\ncars, we were usually enveloped in tobacco smoke, from the effects\nof which I often fainted. When on steamers, on lower deck, we\nsuffered the same from the smoke of tobacco, besides the swearing\nand vulgar conversation of the ship hands and the baser portion of\nthe traveling public. At night we lay down to sleep on the hard floor,\ndry goods boxes, or sacks of grain, with carpetbags for pillows, and\novercoats and shawls for covering. If suffering from the winter\u2019s\ncold, we would walk the deck to keep warm. When oppressed by\nthe heat of summer, we would go upon the upper deck to secure the\ncool night air. This was fatiguing to me, especially when traveling\nwith an infant in my arms. This manner of life was by no means one[78]\nof our choosing. God called us in our poverty, and led us through\nthe furnace of affliction, to give us an experience which should be\nof great worth to us, and an example to others who should afterward\njoin us in labor.\nOur Master was a man of sorrows; He was acquainted with grief;\nand those who suffer with Him will reign with Him. When the Lord\nappeared to Saul in his conversion, He did not purpose to show him\nhow much good he should enjoy, but what great things he should\nsuffer for His name. Suffering has been the portion of the people of\nGod from the days of the martyr Abel. The patriarchs suffered for\nbeing true to God and obedient to His commandments. The great\nHead of the church suffered for our sake; His first apostles and the\nprimitive church suffered; the millions of martyrs suffered, and the\nReformers suffered. And why should we, who have the blessed hope\nof immortality, to be consummated at the soon appearing of Christ,\nshrink from a life of suffering? Were it possible to reach the tree of\nlife in the midst of the Paradise of God without suffering, we would\nnot enjoy so rich a reward for which we had not suffered. We would\nshrink back from the glory; shame would seize us in the presence of\nthose who had fought the good fight, had run the race with patience,\nMarriage and Subsequent Labors 75\nand had laid hold on eternal life. But none will be there who have\nnot, like Moses, chosen to suffer affliction with the people of God.\nThe prophet John saw the multitude of the redeemed, and inquired\nwho they were. The prompt answer came: \u201cThese are they which\ncame out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made\nthem white in the blood of the Lamb.\u201d\nWhen we began to present the light on the Sabbath question, we\nhad no clearly defined idea of the third angel\u2019s message of Revelation\n14:9-12. The burden of our testimony as we came before the people\nwas that the great second advent movement was of God, that the first\nand second messages had gone forth, and that the third was to be [79]\ngiven. We saw that the third message closed with the words: \u201cHere is\nthe patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments\nof God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d And we as clearly saw as we now\nsee that these prophetic words suggested a Sabbath reform; but as\nto what the worship of the beast mentioned in the message was, or\nwhat the image and the mark of the beast were, we had no defined\nposition.\nGod by His Holy Spirit let light shine forth upon His servants,\nand the subject gradually opened to their minds. It required much\nstudy and anxious care to search it out, link after link. By care,\nanxiety, and incessant labor has the work moved on until the great\ntruths of our message, a clear, connected, perfect whole, have been\ngiven to the world.\nI have already spoken of my acquaintance with Elder Bates. I\nfound him to be a true Christian gentleman, courteous and kind. He\ntreated me as tenderly as though I were his own child. The first time\nhe heard me speak, he manifested deep interest. After I had ceased\nspeaking, he arose and said: \u201cI am a doubting Thomas. I do not\nbelieve in visions. But if I could believe that the testimony the sister\nhas related tonight was indeed the voice of God to us, I should be the\nhappiest man alive. My heart is deeply moved. I believe the speaker\nto be sincere, but cannot explain in regard to her being shown the\nwonderful things she has related to us.\u201d\nA few months after my marriage, I attended, with my husband,\na Conference at Topsham, Maine, at which Elder Bates was present.\nHe did not then fully believe that my visions were of God. That\nmeeting was a season of much interest. The Spirit of God rested\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nupon me; I was wrapped in a vision of God\u2019s glory, and for the first\ntime had a view of other planets. After I came out of vision, I related\nwhat I had seen. Elder B. then asked if I had studied astronomy. I\ntold him I had no recollection of ever looking into an astronomy.[80]\nSaid he: \u201cThis is of the Lord.\u201d I never before saw him so free and\nhappy. His countenance shone with the light of heaven, and he\nexhorted the church with power.\nFrom the Conference I returned with my husband to Gorham,\nwhere my parents were then living. Here I was taken very sick,\nand suffered extremely. My parents, husband, and sisters united in\nprayer for me, but I suffered on for three weeks. I often fainted like\none dead, but in answer to prayer revived again. My agony was so\ngreat that I pleaded with those around me not to pray for me; for I\nthought their prayers were protracting my sufferings. Our neighbors\ngave me up to die. For a time it pleased the Lord to try our faith.\nAt length, as my friends again united in prayer for me, a brother\nwho was present seemed much burdened, and with the power of God\nresting upon him, rose from his knees, came across the room, and\nlaid his hands upon my head, saying: \u201cSister Ellen, Jesus Christ\nmaketh thee whole,\u201d and fell back, prostrated by the power of God.\nI believed that the work was of God, and the pain left me. My soul\nwas filled with gratitude and peace. The language of my heart was:\n\u201cThere is no help for us but in God. We can be in peace only as we\nrest in Him and wait for His salvation.\u201d\nThe next day there was a severe storm, and none of the neighbors\ncame to our house. I was able to be up in the sitting room; and as\nsome saw the windows of my room raised, they supposed that I\nwas dead. They knew not that the Great Physician had graciously\nentered the dwelling, rebuked the disease, and set me free. The next\nday we rode thirty-eight miles to Topsham. Inquiries were made of\nmy father, at what time the funeral would be. Father asked: \u201cWhat\nfuneral?\u201d \u201cThe funeral of your daughter,\u201d was the reply. Father\nanswered: \u201cShe has been healed by the prayer of faith, and is on her\nway to Topsham.\u201d\nA few weeks after this, on our way to Boston we took the steamer\nat Portland. A violent storm came up, and we were in great peril. The[81]\nboat rolled fearfully, and the waves dashed into the cabin windows.\nThere was great fear in the ladies\u2019 cabin. Many were confessing\nMarriage and Subsequent Labors 77\ntheir sins, and crying to God for mercy. Some were calling upon the\nVirgin Mary to keep them, while others were making solemn vows\nto God that if they reached land they would devote their lives to His\nservice. It was a scene of terror and confusion. As the boat rocked,\na lady turned to me and said: \u201cAre you not terrified? I suppose it\nis a fact that we may never reach land.\u201d I told her that I had made\nChrist my refuge, and if my work was done, I might as well lie in\nthe bottom of the ocean as in any other place; but if my work was\nnot done, all the waters of the ocean could not drown me. My trust\nwas in God; He would bring us safe to land if it was for His glory.\nAt this time I prized the Christian\u2019s hope. The scene before\nme brought vividly to my mind the day of the Lord\u2019s fierce anger,\nwhen the storm of His wrath will come upon the poor sinner. Then\nthere will be bitter cries and tears, confession of sin, and pleading\nfor mercy, when it will be too late. \u201cBecause I have called, and\nye refused; I have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded;\nbut ye have set at nought all My counsel, and would none of My\nreproof: I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your\nfear cometh.\u201d\nThrough the mercy of God we were all landed safe. But some\nof the passengers who manifested much fear in the storm made\nno reference to it, only to make light of their fears. One who had\nsolemnly promised that if she were preserved to see land she would\nbe a Christian, mockingly cried out as she left the boat: \u201cGlory to\nGod, I am glad to step on land again!\u201d I asked her to go back a few\nhours, and remember her vows to God. She turned from me with a\nsneer.\nI was forcibly reminded of deathbed repentance. Some serve\nthemselves and Satan all their lives, and then as sickness subdues\nthem, and a fearful uncertainty is before them, they manifest some [82]\nsorrow for sin, and perhaps say they are willing to die, and their\nfriends make themselves believe that they have been truly converted\nand fitted for heaven. But if these should recover, they would be\nas rebellious as ever. I am reminded of Proverbs 1:27, 28: \u201cWhen\nyour fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a\nwhirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall\nthey call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early,\nbut they shall not find Me.\u201d\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nAt Gorham, Maine, August 26, 1847, our eldest son, Henry\nNichols White, was born. In October, Brother and Sister Howland of\nTopsham kindly offered us a part of their dwelling, which we gladly\naccepted, and commenced housekeeping with borrowed furniture.\nWe were poor, and saw close times. We had resolved not to be\ndependent, but to support ourselves, and have something with which\nto help others. But we were not prospered. My husband worked\nvery hard hauling stone on the railroad, but could not get what was\ndue him for his labor. Brother and Sister H. freely divided with us\nwhenever they could; but they were in close circumstances. They\nfully believed the first and second messages, and had generously\nimparted of their substance to forward the work, until they were\ndependent on their daily labor.\nMy husband left the railroad, and with his ax went into the woods\nto chop cordwood. With a continual pain in his side, he worked\nfrom early morning till dark to earn about fifty cents a day. He was\nprevented from sleeping nights by severe pain. We endeavored to\nkeep up good courage, and trust in the Lord. I did not murmur. In\nthe morning I felt grateful to God that He had preserved us through\nanother night, and at night I was thankful that He had kept us through\nanother day. One day when our provisions were gone, my husband\nwent to his employer to get money or provisions. It was a stormy day,\nand he walked three miles and back in the rain. He brought home on[83]\nhis back a bag of provisions tied in different compartments, having\nin this manner passed through the village of Brunswick, where he\nhad often lectured. As he entered the house, very weary, my heart\nsank within me. My first feelings were that God had forsaken us.\nI said to my husband: \u201cHave we come to this? Has the Lord left\nus?\u201d I could not restrain my tears, and wept aloud for hours, until I\nfainted. Prayer was offered in my behalf. When I breathed again, I\nfelt the cheering influence of the Spirit of God, and regretted that I\nhad sunk under discouragement. We desire to follow Christ and to\nbe like Him; but we sometimes faint beneath trials, and remain at a\ndistance from Him. Sufferings and trials bring us near to Jesus. The\nfurnace consumes the dross and brightens the gold.\nAt this time I was shown that the Lord had been trying us for\nour good, and to prepare us to labor for others; that He had been\nstirring up our nest, lest we should settle down at ease. Our work\nMarriage and Subsequent Labors 79\nwas to labor for souls; if we had been prospered, home would be\nso pleasant that we would be unwilling to leave it; trials had been\npermitted to come upon us to prepare us for the still greater conflicts\nthat we would meet in our travels. We soon received letters from\nbrethren in different states inviting us to visit them; but we had no\nmeans to take us out of the state. Our reply was that the way was\nnot open before us. I thought that it would be impossible for me to\ntravel with my child. We did not wish to be dependent, and were\ncareful to live within our means. We were resolved to suffer rather\nthan get in debt. I allowed myself and child one pint of milk each\nday. One morning before my husband went to his work, he left me\nnine cents to buy milk for three mornings. It was a study with me\nwhether to buy the milk for myself and babe or get an apron for him.\nI gave up the milk, and purchased the cloth for an apron to cover the\nbare arms of my child.\nLittle Henry was soon taken very sick, and grew worse so fast [84]\nthat we were much alarmed. He lay in a stupid state; his breathing\nwas quick and heavy. We gave remedies with no success. We\nthen called in a person of experience in sickness, who said that his\nrecovery was doubtful. We had prayed for him, but there was no\nchange. We had made the child an excuse for not traveling and\nlaboring for the good of others, and we feared the Lord was about to\nremove him. Once more we went before the Lord, praying that He\nwould have compassion upon us, and spare the life of the child, and\nsolemnly pledging ourselves to go forth, trusting in God, wherever\nHe might send us.\nOur petitions were fervent and agonizing. By faith we claimed\nthe promises of God, and we believed that He listened to our cries.\nLight from heaven was breaking through the clouds and shining\nupon us. Our prayers were graciously answered. From that hour the\nchild began to recover.\nWhile at Topsham we received a letter from Brother Chamberlain\nof Connecticut, urging us to attend a Conference in that state in April,\n1848. We decided to go if we could obtain means. My husband\nsettled with his employer, and found that there was ten dollars due\nhim. With five of this I purchased articles of clothing which we much\nneeded, and then patched my husband\u2019s overcoat, even piecing the\npatches, making it difficult to tell the original cloth in the sleeves.\n80 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWe had five dollars left to take us to Dorchester, Massachusetts. Our\ntrunk contained nearly everything we possessed on earth; but we\nenjoyed peace of mind and a clear conscience, and this we prized\nabove earthly comforts. In Dorchester we called at the house of\nBrother Nichols, and as we left, Sister N. handed my husband five\ndollars, which paid our fare to Middletown, Connecticut. We were\nstrangers in that city, and had never seen one of the brethren in the\nstate. We had but fifty cents left. My husband did not dare to use\nthat to hire a carriage, so he threw the trunk up on a pile of boards,[85]\nand we walked on in search of someone of like faith. We soon found\nBrother C., who took us to his house.\nThe Conference was held at Rocky Hill, in the large, unfinished\nchamber of Brother Belden\u2019s house. The brethren came in until we\nnumbered about fifty; but these were not all fully in the truth. Our\nmeeting was interesting. Brother Bates presented the command-\nments in a clear light, and their importance was urged home by\npowerful testimonies. The word had effect to establish those already\nin the truth, and to awaken those who were not fully decided.\nWe were invited to meet with the brethren in the State of New\nYork the following summer. The believers were poor, and could\nnot promise to do much toward defraying our expenses. We had no\nmeans with which to travel. My husband\u2019s health was poor, but the\nway opened for him to work in the hayfield, and he decided to make\nthe effort. It seemed then that we must live by faith. When we arose\nin the morning, we bowed at our bedside and asked God to give us\nstrength to labor through the day. We would not be satisfied unless\nwe had the assurance that the Lord heard us pray. My husband then\nwent forth to swing the scythe, not in his own strength, but in the\nstrength of the Lord. At night, when he came home, we would again\nplead with God for strength to earn means to spread His truth. We\nwere often greatly blessed. In a letter to Brother Howland, July,\n1848, my husband wrote: \u201cGod gives me strength to labor hard all\nday. Praise His name! I hope to get a few dollars to use in His cause.\nWe have suffered from labor, fatigue, pain, hunger, cold, and heat,\nwhile endeavoring to do our brethren and sisters good, and we hold\nourselves ready to suffer more if God requires. I rejoice today that\nease, pleasure, and comfort in this life are a sacrifice on the altar\nof my faith and hope. If our happiness consists in making others\nMarriage and Subsequent Labors 81\nhappy, we are happy indeed. The true disciple will not live to gratify\nbeloved self, but for Christ, and for the good of His little ones. He is [86]\nto sacrifice his ease, his pleasure, his comfort, his convenience, his\nwill, and his own selfish wishes for Christ\u2019s cause, or never reign\nwith Him on His throne.\u201d\nThe means earned in the hayfield was sufficient to supply our\npresent wants, and also pay our expenses to go to western New York\nand return.\nOur first Conference in New York was held at V olney, in a\nbrother\u2019s barn. About thirty-five were present\u2014all that could be\ncollected in that part of the state. But of this number, hardly two\nwere agreed. Some were holding serious errors, and each strenu-\nously urged his own views, declaring that they were according to\nthe Scriptures.\nThese strange differences of opinion brought a heavy weight\nupon me, as it seemed to me that God was dishonored; and I fainted\nunder the burden. Some feared that I was dying; but the Lord heard\nthe prayers of His servants, and I revived. The light of heaven rested\nupon me, and I was soon lost to earthly things. My accompanying\nangel presented before me some of the errors of those present, and\nalso the truth in contrast with their errors. These discordant views\nwhich they claimed to be according to the Bible were only according\nto their opinion of the Bible, and they must yield their errors and unite\nupon the third angel\u2019s message. Our meeting closed triumphantly.\nTruth gained the victory. The brethren renounced their errors, and\nunited upon the third angel\u2019s message, and God greatly blessed them\nand added to their numbers.\nFrom V olney we went to Port Gibson to attend a meeting in\nBrother Edson\u2019s barn. There were those present who loved the truth,\nbut were listening to and cherishing error. The Lord wrought for\nus in power before the close of that meeting. I was again shown in\nvision the importance of the brethren in western New York laying\naside their differences, and uniting upon Bible truth.\nWe returned to Middletown, where we had left our child during [87]\nour western journey. And now a painful duty presented itself. For\nthe good of souls we felt that we must sacrifice the company of our\nlittle Henry, that we might give ourselves unreservedly to the work.\nMy health was poor, and he would necessarily occupy a great share\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof my time. It was a severe trial, yet I dared not let the child stand\nin the way of my duty. I believed that the Lord had spared him to\nus when he was very sick, and that if I should let him hinder me\nfrom doing my duty, God would remove him from me. Alone before\nthe Lord, with most painful feelings and many tears, I made the\nsacrifice, and gave up my only child, then one year old, for another\nto exercise a mother\u2019s feelings toward him, and to act a mother\u2019s\npart. We left him in Brother Howland\u2019s family, in whom we had the\nutmost confidence. They were willing to bear burdens to leave us\nas free as possible to labor in the cause of God. We knew that they\ncould take better care of Henry than we could while journeying, and\nthat it was for his good to have a steady home and good discipline. It\nwas hard parting with my child. His sad little face, as I left him, was\nbefore me night and day; yet in the strength of the Lord I put him\nout of my mind, and sought to do others good. Brother Howland\u2019s\nfamily had the whole charge of Henry for five years.\n* * * * *\nChapter 12\u2014Publishing and Traveling\nIn June, 1849, the way was opened for us to make our home for\na time at Rocky Hill, Connecticut. Here, on the 28th of July, our\nsecond child, James Edson, was born.\nWhile we were living at this place, my husband was impressed\nthat it was his duty to write and publish the present truth. He was\ngreatly encouraged and blessed as he decided thus to do. But again [88]\nhe would be in doubt and perplexity, as he was penniless. There\nwere brethren who had means, but they chose to keep it. He at length\ngave up in discouragement, and decided to look for a field of grass\nto mow. As he left the house, a burden was rolled upon me, and I\nfainted. Prayer was offered for me, and I was blessed, and taken\noff in vision. I saw that the Lord had blessed and strengthened my\nhusband to labor in the field one year before; that he had made a right\nuse of the means there earned; and that he would have a hundredfold\nin his life, and, if faithful, a rich reward in the kingdom of God; but\nthat the Lord would not now give him strength to labor in the field,\nfor He had another work for him; that he must walk out by faith, and\nwrite and publish the present truth. He immediately commenced to\nwrite, and when he came to some difficult passage, we would call\nupon the Lord to give us the true meaning of His word.\nAbout the same time he began to publish a small sheet entitled,\nThe Present Truth. The office of publication was at Middletown,\neight miles from Rocky Hill, and he often walked this distance and\nback again, although he was then lame. When he brought the first\nnumber from the printing office, we all bowed around it, asking the\nLord, with humble hearts and many tears, to let His blessing rest\nupon the feeble efforts of His servant. He then directed the papers to\nall he thought would read them, and carried them to the post office\nin a carpetbag. Every number was taken from Middletown to Rocky\nHill, and always before preparing them for the post office, we spread\nthem before the Lord, and with earnest prayers mingled with tears,\nentreated that His blessing might attend the silent messengers. Very\n83\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nsoon letters came bringing means to publish the paper, and the good\nnews of many souls embracing the truth.\nWith the beginning of this work of publishing, we did not cease\nour labors in preaching the truth, but traveled from place to place,[89]\nproclaiming the doctrines which had brought so great light and joy\nto us, encouraging the believers, correcting errors, and setting things\nin order in the church. In order to carry forward the publishing\nenterprise, and at the same time continue our labors in different parts\nof the field, the paper was from time to time moved to different\nplaces.\nIn 1850 it was issued at Paris, Maine. Here it was enlarged, and\nits name changed to that which it now bears, The Advent Review\nand Sabbath Herald. The friends of the cause were few in numbers\nand poor in worldly wealth, and we were still compelled to struggle\nwith poverty and great discouragement. Excessive labor, care, and\nanxiety, a lack of proper and nourishing food, and exposure to cold\nin our long winter journeys, were too much for my husband, and he\nsank under the burden. He became so weak that he could scarcely\nwalk to the printing office. Our faith was tried to the utmost. We had\nwillingly endured privation, toil, and suffering; yet our motives were\nmisinterpreted, and we were regarded with distrust and jealousy.\nFew of those for whose good we had suffered, seemed to appreciate\nour efforts. We were too much troubled to sleep or rest. The hours\nin which we should have been refreshed with sleep, were often spent\nin answering long communications occasioned by envy; and many\nhours while others were sleeping we spent in agonizing tears, and\nmourning before the Lord. At length my husband said: \u201cWife, it is\nof no use to try to struggle on any longer. These things are crushing\nme, and will soon carry me to the grave. I cannot go any farther. I\nhave written a note for the paper stating that I shall publish no more.\u201d\nAs he stepped out of the door to carry it to the printing office, I\nfainted. He came back and prayed for me; his prayer was answered,\nand I was relieved.\nThe next morning, while at family prayer, I was taken off in\nvision, and was shown concerning these matters. I saw that my\nhusband must not give up the paper; for such a step was just what[90]\nSatan was trying to drive him to take, and he was working through\nagents to do this. I was shown that we must continue to publish, and\nPublishing and Traveling 85\nthat the Lord would sustain us; that those who had been guilty of\ncasting upon us such burdens would have to see the extent of their\ncruel course, and come back confessing their injustice, or the frown\nof God would be upon them; that it was not against us merely that\nthey had spoken and acted, but against Him who had called us to\nfill the place He wished us to occupy; and that all their suspicion,\njealousy, and secret influence was faithfully chronicled in heaven,\nand would not be blotted out until everyone who had taken a part in\nit should see the extent of his wrong course, and retrace every step.\nThe second volume of the Review was published at Saratoga\nSprings, New York. In April, 1852, we moved to Rochester, New\nYork. At every step we were obliged to move out by faith. We were\nstill crippled by poverty, and compelled to exercise the most rigid\neconomy and self-denial. I will give a brief extract from a letter\nto Brother Howland\u2019s family, dated April 16, 1852: \u201cWe are just\ngetting settled in Rochester. We have rented an old house for one\nhundred and seventy-five dollars a year. We have the press in the\nhouse. Were it not for this, we should have to pay fifty dollars a year\nfor office room. You would smile could you look in upon us and\nsee our furniture. We have bought two old bedsteads for twenty-five\ncents each. My husband brought me home six old chairs, no two\nof them alike, for which he paid one dollar, and soon he presented\nme with four more old chairs without seating, for which he paid\nsixty-two cents. The frames are strong, and I have been seating them\nwith drilling. Butter is so high that we do not purchase it, neither can\nwe afford potatoes. We use sauce in the place of butter, and turnips\nfor potatoes. Our first meals were taken on a fireboard placed upon\ntwo empty flour barrels. We are willing to endure privations if the [91]\nwork of God can be advanced. We believe the Lord\u2019s hand was in\nour coming to this place. There is a large field for labor, and but\nfew laborers. Last Sabbath our meeting was excellent. The Lord\nrefreshed us with His presence.\u201d\nFrom time to time we went out to attend Conferences in different\nparts of the field. My husband preached, sold books, and labored\nto extend the circulation of the paper. We traveled by private con-\nveyance, and stopped at noon to feed our horse by the roadside, and\nto eat our lunch. Then with paper and pencil, on the cover of our\ndinner box or the top of his hat, my husband wrote articles for the\n86 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nReview and Instructor. The Lord greatly blessed our labors, and the\ntruth affected many hearts.\nIn the summer of 1853, we made our first journey to the State\nof Michigan. After publishing our appointments, my husband was\nprostrated with fever. We united in prayer for him, but though\nrelieved, he still remained very weak. We were in great perplexity.\nMust we be driven from the work by bodily infirmities? Would\nSatan be permitted to exercise his power upon us, and contend for\nour usefulness and lives as long as we should remain in the world?\nWe knew that God could limit the power of Satan. He might suffer\nus to be tried in the furnace, but would bring us forth purified and\nbetter fitted for His work.\nAlone I poured out my soul before God in prayer that He would\nrebuke the disease and strengthen my husband to endure the journey.\nThe case was urgent, and my faith firmly grasped the promises of\nGod. I there obtained the evidence that if we should proceed on our\njourney to Michigan, the angel of God would go with us. When I\nrelated to my husband the exercise of my mind, he said that his own\nmind had been exercised in a similar manner, and we decided to go,\ntrusting in the Lord. Every mile we traveled he felt strengthened.[92]\nThe Lord sustained him. And while he was preaching the word, I\nfelt assured that angels of God were standing by his side to sustain\nhim in his labors.\nOn this journey my husband\u2019s mind was much exercised upon\nthe subject of spiritualism, and soon after our return he engaged in\nwriting the book entitled, Signs of the Times. He was still feeble, and\ncould sleep but little, but the Lord was his support. When his mind\nwas in a confused, suffering state, we would bow before God, and in\nour distress cry unto Him. He heard our earnest prayers, and often\nblessed my husband so that with refreshed spirits he went on with\nthe work. Many times in the day did we thus go before the Lord in\nearnest prayer. That book was not written in his own strength.\nIn the winter and spring I suffered much from heart disease.\nIt was difficult for me to breathe while lying down, and I could\nnot sleep unless raised in nearly a sitting posture. My breath often\nstopped, and I often fainted. I had upon my left eyelid a swelling\nwhich appeared to be a cancer. It had been increasing gradually for\nmore than a year, until it had become quite painful, and affected my\nPublishing and Traveling 87\nsight. When reading or writing, I was forced to bandage the afflicted\neye. I feared that it was to be destroyed by a cancer. I looked back to\nthe days and nights spent in reading proof sheets, which had strained\nmy eyes, and thought: \u201cIf I lose my eye and my life, they will be\nsacrificed to the cause of God.\u201d\nAbout this time a celebrated physician who gave counsel free\nvisited Rochester, and I decided to have him examine my eye. He\nthought the swelling would prove to be a cancer. But upon feeling\nmy pulse, he said: \u201cYou are much diseased, and will die of apoplexy\nbefore that swelling shall break out. You are in a dangerous condition\nwith disease of the heart.\u201d This did not startle me, for I had been\naware that without speedy relief I must go down to the grave. Two\nother women who had come for counsel were suffering with the same [93]\ndisease. The physician said that I was in a more dangerous condition\nthan either of them, and it could not be more than three weeks before\nI would be afflicted with paralysis. I asked if he thought his medicine\nwould cure me. He did not give me much encouragement. I tried the\nremedies which he prescribed, but received no benefit.\nIn about three weeks I fainted and fell to the floor, and remained\nnearly unconscious about thirty-six hours. It was feared that I could\nnot live, but in answer to prayer I again revived. One week later\nI received a shock upon my left side. I had a strange sensation of\ncoldness and numbness in my head, and severe pain in my temples.\nMy tongue seemed heavy and numb; I could not speak plainly. My\nleft arm and side were helpless. I thought I was dying, and my great\nanxiety was to have the evidence in my sufferings that the Lord\nloved me. For months I had suffered continual pain in my heart,\nand my spirits were constantly depressed. I had tried to serve God\nfrom principle without feeling, but I now thirsted for the salvation of\nGod, I longed to realize His blessing notwithstanding my physical\nsuffering.\nThe brethren and sisters came together to make my case a special\nsubject of prayer. My desire was granted; I received the blessing\nof God, and had the assurance that He loved me. But the pain\ncontinued, and I grew more feeble every hour. Again the brethren\nand sisters assembled to present my case to the Lord. I was so weak\nthat I could not pray vocally. My appearance seemed to weaken the\nfaith of those around me. Then the promises of God were arrayed\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbefore me as I had never viewed them before. It seemed to me that\nSatan was striving to tear me from my husband and children and lay\nme in the grave, and these questions were suggested to my mind:\nCan you believe the naked promise of God? Can you walk out by\nfaith, let the appearance be what it may? Faith revived. I whispered[94]\nto my husband: \u201cI believe that I shall recover.\u201d He answered: \u201cI\nwish I could believe it.\u201d I retired that night without relief, yet relying\nwith firm confidence upon the promises of God. I could not sleep,\nbut continued my silent prayer. Just before day I fell asleep.\nI awoke at sunrise perfectly free from pain. The pressure upon\nmy heart was gone, and I was very happy. Oh, what a change! It\nseemed to me that an angel of God had touched me while I was\nsleeping. I was filled with gratitude. The praise of God was upon my\nlips. I awoke my husband, and related to him the wonderful work\nthat the Lord had wrought for me. He could scarcely comprehend it\nat first; but when I arose and dressed and walked around the house,\nhe could praise God with me. My afflicted eye was free from pain.\nIn a few days the swelling disappeared, and my eyesight was fully\nrestored. The work was complete.\nAgain I visited the physician, and as soon as he felt my pulse, he\nsaid: \u201cMadam, an entire change has taken place in your system; but\nthe two women who visited me for counsel when you were last here\nare dead.\u201d I stated to him that his medicine had not cured me, as I\ncould take none of it. After I left, the doctor said to a friend of mine:\n\u201cHer case is a mystery. I do not understand it.\u201d\nWe soon visited Michigan again, and I endured long and weari-\nsome journeys over the rough logways, and through mud sloughs,\nand my strength failed not. We felt that the Lord would have us visit\nWisconsin, and arranged to take the cars at Jackson at ten in the\nevening.\nAs we were preparing to take the train, we felt very solemn, and\nproposed a season of prayer. And as we there committed ourselves\nto God, we could not refrain from weeping. We went to the depot\nwith feelings of deep solemnity. On boarding the train, we went\ninto a forward car, which had seats with high backs, hoping that\nwe might sleep some that night. The car was full, and we passed[95]\nback into the next, and there found seats. I did not, as usual when\ntraveling in the night, lay off my bonnet, but held my carpetbag in\nPublishing and Traveling 89\nmy hand, as if waiting for something. We both spoke of our singular\nfeelings.\nThe train had run about three miles from Jackson when its motion\nbecame very violent, jerking backward and forward, and finally\nstopping. I opened the window, and saw one car raised nearly upon\nend. I heard agonizing groans, and there was great confusion. The\nengine had been thrown from the track; but the car we were in was\non the track, and was separated about one hundred feet from those\nbefore it. The baggage car was not much damaged, and our large\ntrunk of books was uninjured. The second-class car was crushed,\nand the pieces, with the passengers, were thrown on both sides of\nthe track. The car in which we tried to get a seat was much broken,\nand one end was raised upon the heap of ruins. The coupling did not\nbreak, but the car we were in was unfastened from the one before\nit, as if an angel had separated them. Four were killed or mortally\nwounded, and many were much injured. We could but feel that God\nhad sent an angel to preserve our lives.\nWe returned to Jackson, and the next day took the train for\nWisconsin. Our visit to that state was blessed of God. Souls were\nconverted as the result of our efforts. The Lord strengthened me to\nendure the tedious journey.\nAugust 29, 1854, another responsibility was added to our family\nin the birth of Willie. About this time the first number of the paper\nfalsely called The Messenger of Truth was received. Those who\nslandered us through that paper had been reproved for their faults\nand errors. They would not bear reproof, and in a secret manner at\nfirst, afterward more openly, used their influence against us. This\nwe could have borne, but some of those who should have stood by\nus were influenced by these wicked persons. Some whom we had [96]\ntrusted, and who had acknowledged that our labors had been signally\nblessed of God, withdrew their sympathy from us, and bestowed it\nupon comparative strangers.\nThe Lord had shown me the character and final come-out of that\nparty; that His frown was upon those connected with that paper,\nand His hand was against them. And although they might appear\nto prosper for a time, and some honest ones be deceived, yet truth\nwould eventually triumph, and every honest soul would break away\nfrom the deception which had held him, and come out clear from\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe influence of those wicked men; as God\u2019s hand was against them,\nthey must go down.\nAgain my husband\u2019s health became very poor. He was troubled\nwith cough and soreness of lungs, and his nervous system was pros-\ntrated. His anxiety of mind, the burdens which he bore in Rochester,\nhis labor in the office, sickness and deaths in the family, the lack of\nsympathy from those who should have shared his labors, together\nwith his traveling and preaching, were too much for his strength,\nand he seemed to be fast going down to a consumptive\u2019s grave. That\nwas a time of gloom and darkness. A few rays of light occasionally\nparted the heavy clouds, giving us a little hope, or we should have\nsunk in despair. It seemed at times that God had forsaken us.\nThe Messenger party framed all manner of falsehoods concern-\ning us. These words of the psalmist were often brought forcibly to\nmy mind: \u201cFret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou\nenvious against the workers of iniquity. For they shall soon be cut\ndown like the grass, and wither as the green herb.\u201d Some of the writ-\ners of that sheet even triumphed over the feebleness of my husband,\nsaying that God would take care of him, and remove him out of\nthe way. When he read this as he lay sick, faith revived, and he\nexclaimed: \u201cI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the\nLord, and may yet preach at their funeral.\u201d\nThe darkest clouds seemed to shut down over us. Wicked men[97]\nprofessing godliness, under the command of Satan were hurried on\nto forge falsehoods, and to bring the strength of their forces against\nus. If the cause of God had been ours alone, we might have trembled;\nbut it was in the hands of Him who could say: \u201cNo one is able to\npluck it out of My hands.\u201d We knew that Jesus lived and reigned. We\ncould say before the Lord: The cause is Thine, and Thou knowest\nthat it has not been our own choice, but by Thy command, that we\nhave acted the part we have in it.\n* * * * *\nChapter 13\u2014Removal to Michigan\nIn 1855 the brethren in Michigan opened the way for the office of\npublication to be removed to Battle Creek. At that time my husband\nwas owing between two and three thousand dollars, and all he had\nbesides the books on hand was accounts for books, and some of these\nwere doubtful. The cause had apparently come to a halt, orders for\npublications were very few and small, and he feared that he would\ndie in debt. Brethren in Michigan assisted us in obtaining a lot and\nbuilding a house. The deed was made in my name, so that I could\ndispose of it at pleasure after the death of my husband.\nThose were days of sadness. I looked upon my three little boys,\nsoon, as I feared, to be left fatherless, and thoughts like these forced\nthemselves upon me: My husband dies of overwork in the cause of\npresent truth; and who realizes what he has suffered, the burdens he\nhas for years borne, the extreme care which has crushed his spirits\nand ruined his health, bringing him to an untimely grave, leaving\nhis family destitute and dependent? I have often asked the question,\nDoes God have no care for these things? Does He pass them by\nunnoticed? I was comforted to know that there is One who judgeth [98]\nrighteously, and that every sacrifice, every self-denial, and every\npang of anguish endured for His sake, is faithfully chronicled in\nheaven, and will bring its reward. The day of the Lord will declare\nand bring to light things that are not yet made manifest.\nI was shown that God designed to raise my husband up gradually;\nthat we must exercise strong faith, for in every effort we should be\nfiercely buffeted by Satan; that we must look away from outward\nappearance, and believe. Three times a day we went alone before\nGod, and engaged in earnest prayer for the recovery of his health.\nFrequently one of us would be prostrated by the power of God. The\nLord graciously heard our earnest cries, and my husband began to\nrecover. For many months our prayers ascended to heaven three\ntimes a day for health to do the will of God. These seasons of prayer\nwere very precious. We were brought into a sacred nearness to\n91\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nGod, and had sweet communion with Him. I cannot better state my\nfeelings at this time than they are expressed in the following extracts\nfrom a letter I wrote to Sister Howland:\n\u201cI feel thankful that I can now have my children with me, under\nmy own watchcare, and can better train them in the right way. For\nweeks I have felt a hungering and thirsting for salvation, and we\nhave enjoyed almost uninterrupted communion with God. Why do\nwe stay away from the fountain, when we can come and drink? Why\ndo we die for bread, when there is a storehouse full? It is rich and\nfree. O my soul, feast upon it, and daily drink in heavenly joys. I\nwill not hold my peace. The praise of God is in my heart and upon\nmy lips. We can rejoice in the fullness of our Saviour\u2019s love. We\ncan feast upon His excellent glory. My soul testifies to this. My\ngloom has been dispersed by this precious light, and I can never\nforget it. Lord, help me to keep it in lively remembrance. Awake, all\nthe energies of my soul! Awake, and adore thy Redeemer for His\nwondrous love!\n\u201cSouls around us must be aroused and saved, or they perish.[99]\nNot a moment have we to lose. We all have an influence that tells\nfor the truth or against it. I desire to carry with me unmistakable\nevidences that I am one of Christ\u2019s disciples. We want something\nbesides Sabbath religion. We need the living principle, and to daily\nfeel individual responsibility. This is shunned by many, and the fruit\nis carelessness, indifference, a lack of watchfulness and spirituality.\nWhere is the spirituality of the church? Where are men and women\nfull of faith and the Holy Spirit? My prayer is: Purify Thy church,\nO God. For months I have enjoyed freedom, and I am determined to\norder my conversation and all my ways aright before the Lord.\n\u201cOur enemies may triumph. They may speak bitter words, and\ntheir tongue frame slander, deceit, and falsehood, yet will we not\nbe moved. We know in whom we have believed. We have not run\nin vain, neither labored in vain. A reckoning day is coming, when\nall will be judged according to the deeds done in the body. It is true\nthe world is dark. Opposition may wax strong. The trifler and the\nscorner may grow bold in their iniquity. Yet for all this we will not\nbe moved, but lean upon the arm of the Mighty One for strength.\n\u201cGod is sifting His people. He will have a clean and holy church.\nWe cannot read the heart of man. But the Lord has provided means\nRemoval to Michigan 93\nto keep the church pure. A corrupt people has arisen who could\nnot live with the people of God. They despised reproof, and would\nnot be corrected. They had an opportunity to know that theirs was\nan unrighteous warfare. They had time to repent of their wrongs;\nbut self was too dear to die. They nourished it, and it grew strong,\nand they separated from the trusting people of God, whom He is\npurifying unto Himself. We all have reason to thank God that a way\nhas been opened to save the church; for the wrath of God must have\ncome upon us if these corrupt pretenders had remained with us.\n\u201cEvery honest soul that may be deceived by these disaffected [100]\nones, will have the true light in regard to them, if every angel from\nheaven has to visit them, to enlighten their minds. We have nothing\nto fear in this matter. As we near the judgment, all will manifest\ntheir true character, and it will be made plain to what company they\nbelong. The sieve is moving. Let us not say: Stay Thy hand, O God.\nThe church must be purged, and it will be. God reigns; let the people\npraise Him. I have not the most distant thought of sinking down. I\nmean to be right and do right. The judgment is to set, the books are\nto be opened, and we are to be judged according to our deeds. All\nthe falsehoods that may be framed against me will not make me any\nworse, nor any better unless they have a tendency to drive me nearer\nmy Redeemer.\u201d\nFrom the time we moved to Battle Creek, the Lord began to\nturn our captivity. We found sympathizing friends in Michigan,\nwho were ready to share our burdens and supply our wants. Old,\ntried friends in central New York and New England, especially in\nVermont, sympathized with us in our afflictions, and were ready to\nassist us in time of distress. At the Conference at Battle Creek in\nNovember, 1856, God wrought for us. The minds of His servants\nwere exercised as to the gifts of the church. If God\u2019s frown had\nbeen brought upon His people because the gifts had been slighted\nand neglected, there was a pleasing prospect that His smiles would\nagain be upon us, that He would graciously revive the gifts, and\nthey would live in the church to encourage the fainting soul, and to\ncorrect and reprove the erring. New life was given to the cause, and\nsuccess attended the labors of our preachers.\nThe publications were called for, and proved to be just what the\ncause demanded. The Messenger of Truth soon went down, and the\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndiscordant spirits who had spoken through it were scattered. My\nhusband was enabled to pay all his debts. His cough ceased, the pain[101]\nand soreness left his lungs and throat, and he was gradually restored\nto health, so that he could preach three times on the Sabbath and on\nfirst day with ease. This wonderful work in his restoration was of\nGod, and He should have all the glory.\nWhen my husband became so feeble, before our removal from\nRochester, he desired to free himself from the responsibility of the\npublishing work. He proposed that the church take charge of the\nwork, and that it be managed by a publishing committee whom they\nshould appoint, and that no one connected with the office derive any\nfinancial benefit therefrom beyond the wages received for his labor.\nThough the matter was repeatedly urged upon their attention,\nour brethren took no action in regard to it until 1861. Up to this time\nmy husband had been the legal proprietor of the publishing house,\nand sole manager of the work. He enjoyed the confidence of the\nactive friends of the cause, who trusted to his care the means which\nthey donated from time to time, as the growing cause demanded, to\nbuild up the publishing enterprise. But although the statement was\nfrequently repeated through the Review, that the publishing house\nwas virtually the property of the church, yet as he was the only legal\nmanager, our enemies took advantage of the situation, and under the\ncry of speculation, did all in their power to injure him, and to retard\nthe progress of the cause. Under these circumstances he introduced\nthe matter of organization, which resulted in the incorporation of\nthe Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association, according to the\nlaws of Michigan, in the spring of 1861.\nAlthough the cares that came upon us in connection with the\npublishing work and other branches of the cause involved much\nperplexity, the greatest sacrifice I was called to make in connection\nwith the work was to leave my children to the care of others.\nHenry had been from us five years, and Edson had received[102]\nbut little of our care. For years our family was very large, and our\nhome like a hotel, and we from that home much of the time. I had\nfelt the deepest anxiety that my children should be brought up free\nfrom evil habits, and I was often grieved as I thought of the contrast\nbetween my situation and that of others who would not take burdens\nand cares, who could ever be with their children, to counsel and\nRemoval to Michigan 95\ninstruct them, and who spent their time almost exclusively in their\nown families. And I have inquired: Does God require so much of\nus, and leave others without burdens? Is this equality? Are we to\nbe thus hurried on from one care to another, one part of the work\nto another, and have but little time to bring up our children? Many\nnights, while others were sleeping, have been spent by me in bitter\nweeping.\nI would plan some course more favorable for my children, then\nobjections would arise which would sweep away these plans. I\nwas keenly sensitive to faults in my children, and every wrong they\ncommitted brought on me such heartache as to affect my health. I\nhave wished that some mothers could be circumstanced for a short\ntime as I have been for years; then they would prize the blessings\nthey enjoy, and could better sympathize with me in my privations.\nWe prayed and labored for our children, and restrained them. We did\nnot neglect the rod, but before using it we first labored to have them\nsee their faults, and then prayed with them. We sought to have our\nchildren understand that we would merit the displeasure of God if\nwe excused them in sin. And our efforts were blessed to their good.\nTheir greatest pleasure was to please us. They were not free from\nfaults, but we believed that they would yet be lambs of Christ\u2019s fold.\nIn 1860 death stepped over our threshold, and broke the youngest\nbranch of our family tree. Little Herbert, born September 20, 1860, [103]\ndied December 14 of the same year. When that tender branch was\nbroken, how our hearts did bleed none may know but those who\nhave followed their little ones of promise to the grave.\nBut oh, when our noble Henry died, [The death of Henry N.\nWhite occurred at Topsham, Maine, December 8, 1863.] at the age\nof sixteen; when our sweet singer was borne to the grave, and we\nno more heard his early song, ours was a lonely home. Both parents\nand the two remaining sons felt the blow most keenly. But God\ncomforted us in our bereavements, and with faith and courage we\npressed forward in the work He had given us, in bright hope of\nmeeting our children who had been torn from us by death, in that\nworld where sickness and death will never come.\nIn August, 1865, my husband was suddenly stricken down by\nparalysis. This was a heavy blow, not only to myself and my children,\nbut to the cause of God. The churches were deprived both of my\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhusband\u2019s labors and of my own. Satan triumphed as he saw the\nwork of truth thus hindered. But, thank God! he was not permitted\nto destroy us. After being cut off from all active labor for fifteen\nmonths, we ventured out once more together to work among the\nchurches.\nHaving become fully satisfied that my husband would not recover\nfrom his protracted sickness while remaining inactive, and that the\ntime had fully come for me to go forth and bear my testimony to\nthe people, I decided to make a tour in northern Michigan, with my\nhusband in his extremely feeble condition, in the severest cold of\nwinter. It required no small degree of moral courage and faith in God\nto bring my mind to the decision to risk so much; but I knew that I\nhad a work to do, and it seemed to me that Satan was determined\nto keep me from it. I had waited long for our captivity to be turned,\nand feared that precious souls would be lost by the delay. To remain[104]\nlonger from the field seemed to me worse than death, and should\nwe move out we could but perish. So, on the 19th of December,\n1866, we left Battle Creek in a snowstorm for Wright, Michigan.\nMy husband stood the journey of ninety miles much better than I\nfeared, and seemed quite as well when we reached our destination\nas when we left Battle Creek.\nHere commenced our first effective labors since his sickness.\nHere he began labor as in former years, though in much weakness.\nHe would speak thirty or forty minutes in the forenoon of the Sabbath\nand on first day, while I would occupy the rest of the time, and then\nspeak in the afternoon of each day, about an hour and a half each\ntime. We were listened to with the greatest attention. I saw that\nmy husband was growing stronger, clearer, and more connected in\nhis subjects. And when on one occasion he spoke one hour with\nclearness and power, with the burden of the work upon him as before\nhis sickness, my feelings of gratitude were beyond expression. I\narose in the congregation, and for nearly half an hour tried with\nweeping to give utterance to them. The congregation was deeply\nmoved. I felt assured that this was the dawn of better days for us.\nThe hand of God in his restoration was most apparent. Probably\nno other one upon whom such a blow has fallen ever recovered. Yet\na severe shock of paralysis, seriously affecting the brain, was by\nRemoval to Michigan 97\nthe good hand of God removed from His servant, and new strength\ngranted him both in body and mind.\nDuring the years that followed the recovery of my husband, the\nLord opened before us a vast field of labor. Though I took the stand\nas a speaker timidly at first, yet as the providence of God opened\nthe way before me, I had confidence to stand before large audiences.\nTogether we attended our camp meetings and other large gatherings,\nfrom Maine to Dakota, from Michigan to Texas and California.\nThe work begun in feebleness and obscurity has continued to [105]\nincrease and strengthen. Publishing houses in Michigan and in\nCalifornia, and missions in England, Norway, and Switzerland,\nattest its growth. In place of the edition of our first paper carried\nto the office in a carpetbag, about one hundred and forty thousand\ncopies of our various periodicals are now sent out monthly from the\noffices of publication. The hand of God has been with His work to\nprosper and build it up.\nThe later history of my life would involve the history of the\nvarious enterprises which have arisen among us, and with which my\nlifework has been closely intermingled. For the upbuilding of these\ninstitutions, my husband and myself labored with pen and voice. To\nnotice, even briefly, the experience of these active and busy years,\nwould far exceed the limits of this sketch. Satan\u2019s efforts to hinder\nthe work and to destroy the workmen have not ceased; but God has\nhad a care for His servants and for His work.\n* * * * *\nChapter 14\u2014The Death of My Husband\nNotwithstanding the labors, cares, and responsibilities with\nwhich my husband\u2019s life had been crowded, his sixtieth year found\nhim active and vigorous in mind and body. Three times had he fallen\nunder a stroke of paralysis; yet by the blessing of God, a naturally\nstrong constitution, and strict attention to the laws of health, he had\nbeen enabled to rally. Again he traveled, preached, and wrote with\nhis wonted zeal and energy. Side by side we had labored in the cause\nof Christ for thirty-six years; and we hoped that we might stand\ntogether to witness the triumphant close. But such was not the will\nof God. The chosen protector of my youth, the companion of my[106]\nlife, the sharer of my labors and afflictions, has been taken from my\nside, and I am left to finish my work and to fight the battle alone.\nThe spring and early summer of 1881 we spent together at our\nhome in Battle Creek. My husband hoped to arrange his business so\nthat we could go to the Pacific Coast and devote ourselves to writing.\nHe felt that we had made a mistake in allowing the apparent wants\nof the cause and the entreaties of our brethren to urge us into active\nlabor in preaching when we should have been writing. My husband\ndesired to present more fully the glorious subject of redemption,\nand I had long contemplated the preparation of important books.\nWe both felt that while our mental powers were unimpaired we\nshould complete these works\u2014that it was a duty which we owed to\nourselves and to the cause of God to rest from the heat of battle, and\ngive to our people the precious light of truth which God had opened\nto our minds.\nSome weeks before the death of my husband, I urged upon him\nthe importance of seeking a field of labor where we would be re-\nleased from the burdens necessarily coming upon us at Battle Creek.\nIn reply he spoke of various matters which required attention before\nwe could leave\u2014duties which someone must do. Then with deep\nfeeling he inquired: \u201cWhere are the men to do this work? Where\nare those who will have an unselfish interest in our institutions, and\n98\nDeath of My Husband 99\nwho will stand for the right, unaffected by any influence with which\nthey may come in contact?\u201d\nWith tears he expressed his anxiety for our institutions at Battle\nCreek. Said he: \u201cMy life has been given to the up-building of\nthese institutions. It seems like death to leave them. They are as\nmy children, and I cannot separate my interest from them. These\ninstitutions are the Lord\u2019s instrumentalities to do a specific work.\nSatan seeks to hinder and defeat every means by which the Lord is\nworking for the salvation of men. If the great adversary can mold [107]\nthese institutions according to the world\u2019s standard, his object is\ngained. It is my greatest anxiety to have the right man in the right\nplace. If those who stand in responsible positions are weak in moral\npower, and vacillating in principle, inclined to lead toward the world,\nthere are enough who will be led. Evil influences must not prevail.\nI would rather die than live to see these institutions mismanaged,\nor turned aside from the purpose for which they were brought into\nexistence.\n\u201cIn my relations to this cause I have been longest and most\nclosely connected with the publishing work. Three times have I\nfallen, stricken with paralysis, through my devotion to this branch\nof the cause. Now that God has given me renewed physical and\nmental strength, I feel that I can serve His cause as I have never been\nable to serve it before. I must see the publishing work prosper. It is\ninterwoven with my very existence. If I forget the interests of this\nwork, let my right hand forget her cunning.\u201d\nWe had an appointment to attend a tent meeting at Charlotte,\nSabbath and Sunday, July 23 and 24. As I was in feeble health, we\ndecided to travel by private conveyance. On the way, my husband\nseemed cheerful, yet a feeling of solemnity rested upon him. He\nrepeatedly praised the Lord for mercies and blessings received, and\nfreely expressed his own feelings concerning the past and future:\n\u201cThe Lord is good, and greatly to be praised. He is a present help in\ntime of need. The future seems cloudy and uncertain, but the Lord\nwould not have us distressed over these things. When trouble comes,\nHe will give us grace to endure it. What the Lord has been to us, and\nwhat He has done for us, should make us so grateful that we would\nnever murmur or complain. Our labors, burdens, and sacrifices will\nnever be fully appreciated by all. I see that I have lost my peace of\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmind and the blessing of God by permitting myself to be troubled\nby these things.\n\u201cIt has seemed hard to me that my motives should be misjudged,[108]\nand that my best efforts to help, encourage, and strengthen my\nbrethren should again and again be turned against me. But I should\nhave remembered Jesus and His disappointments. His soul was\ngrieved that He was not appreciated by those He came to bless.\nI should have dwelt upon the mercy and loving-kindness of God,\npraising Him more, and complaining less of the ingratitude of my\nbrethren. Had I ever left all my perplexities with the Lord, thinking\nless of what others said and did against me, I should have had more\npeace and joy. I will now seek first to guard myself that I offend not\nin word or deed, and then to help my brethren make straight paths\nfor their feet. I will not stop to mourn over any wrong done to me. I\nhave expected more of men than I ought. I love God and His work,\nand I love my brethren also.\u201d\nLittle did I think, as we traveled on, that this was the last journey\nwe would ever make together. The weather changed suddenly from\noppressive heat to chilling cold. My husband took cold, but thought\nhis health so good that he would receive no permanent injury. He\nlabored in the meetings at Charlotte, presenting the truth with great\nclearness and power. He spoke of the pleasure he felt in addressing\na people who manifested so deep an interest in the subjects most\ndear to him. \u201cThe Lord has indeed refreshed my soul,\u201d he said,\n\u201cwhile I have been breaking to others the bread of life. All over\nMichigan the people are calling eagerly for help. How I long to\ncomfort, encourage, and strengthen them with the precious truths\napplicable to this time!\u201d\nOn our return home, my husband complained of slight indisposi-\ntion, yet he engaged in his work as usual. Every morning we visited\nthe grove near our home, and united in prayer. We were anxious to\nknow our duty. Letters were continually coming in from different\nplaces, urging us to attend the camp meetings. Notwithstanding our\ndetermination to devote ourselves to writing, it was hard to refuse to[109]\nmeet with our brethren in these important gatherings. We earnestly\npleaded for wisdom to know the right course.\nSabbath morning, as usual, we went to the grove together, and\nmy husband prayed most fervently three times. He seemed reluctant\nDeath of My Husband 101\nto cease pleading with God for special guidance and blessing. His\nprayers were heard, and peace and light came to our hearts. He\npraised the Lord, and said: \u201cNow I give it all up to Jesus. I feel\na sweet, heavenly peace, an assurance that the Lord will show us\nour duty; for we desire to do His will.\u201d He accompanied me to the\nTabernacle, and opened the services with singing and prayer. It was\nthe last time he was ever to stand by my side in the pulpit.\nOn the following Monday he had a severe chill, and the next day\nI, too, was attacked. Together we were taken to the sanitarium for\ntreatment. On Friday my symptoms became more favorable. The\ndoctor then informed me that my husband was inclined to sleep, and\nthat danger was apprehended. I was immediately taken to his room,\nand as soon as I looked upon his countenance I knew that he was\ndying. I tried to arouse him. He understood all that was said to him,\nand responded to all questions that could be answered by Yes or No,\nbut seemed unable to say more. When I told him I thought he was\ndying, he manifested no surprise. I asked if Jesus was precious to\nhim. He said \u201cYes, oh, yes.\u201d \u201cHave you no desire to live?\u201d I inquired.\nHe answered: \u201cNo.\u201d\nWe then knelt by his bedside, and I prayed for him. A peaceful\nexpression rested upon his countenance. I said to him. \u201cJesus loves\nyou. The everlasting arms are beneath you.\u201d He responded: \u201cYes,\nyes.\u201d\nBrother Smith and other brethren then prayed around his bedside,\nand retired to spend much of the night in prayer. My husband said\nhe felt no pain; but he was evidently failing fast. Dr. Kellogg and his\nhelpers did all that was in their power to hold him back from death. [110]\nHe slowly revived, but continued very weak.\nThe next morning he seemed slightly to revive, but about noon\nhe had a chill, which left him unconscious. At 5 p. m., Sabbath,\nAugust 6, 1881, he quietly breathed his life away, without a struggle\nor a groan.\nThe shock of my husband\u2019s death\u2014so sudden, so unexpected\u2014\nfell upon me with crushing weight. In my feeble condition I had\nsummoned strength to remain at his bedside to the last, but when\nI saw his eyes closed in death, exhausted nature gave way, and\nI was completely prostrated. For some time I seemed balancing\nbetween life and death. The vital flame burned so low that a breath\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmight extinguish it. At night my pulse would grow feeble, and my\nbreathing fainter and fainter till it seemed about to cease. Only by\nthe blessing of God and the unremitting care and watchfulness of\nphysician and attendants was my life preserved.\nThough I had not risen from my sickbed after my husband\u2019s\ndeath, I was borne to the Tabernacle on the following Sabbath to\nattend his funeral. At the close of the sermon I felt it a duty to\ntestify to the value of the Christian\u2019s hope in the hour of sorrow and\nbereavement. As I arose, strength was given me, and I spoke about\nten minutes, exalting the mercy and love of God in the presence of\nthat crowded assembly. At the close of the services I followed my\nhusband to Oak Hill Cemetery, where he was laid to rest until the\nmorning of the resurrection.\nMy physical strength had been prostrated by the blow, yet the\npower of divine grace sustained me in my great bereavement. When\nI saw my husband breathe his last, I felt that Jesus was more precious\nto me then than He ever had been in any previous hour of my life.\nWhen I stood by my first-born, and closed his eyes in death, I could\nsay: \u201cThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the\nname of the Lord.\u201d And I felt then that I had a comforter in Jesus.\nAnd when my latest born was torn from my arms, and I could no[111]\nlonger see its little head upon the pillow by my side, then I could\nsay: \u201cThe Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be\nthe name of the Lord.\u201d And when he upon whose large affections I\nhad leaned, with whom I had labored for thirty-six years, was taken\naway, I could lay my hands upon his eyes, and say: I commit my\ntreasure to Thee until the morning of the resurrection.\nWhen I saw him passing away, and saw the many friends sympa-\nthizing with me, I thought: What a contrast to the death of Jesus as\nHe hung upon the cross! What a contrast! In the hour of His agony,\nthe revilers were mocking and deriding Him. But He died, and He\npassed through the tomb to brighten it, and to lighten it, that we\nmight have joy and hope even in the event of death; that we might\nsay, as we lay our friends away to rest in Jesus: We shall meet them\nagain.\nAt times I felt that I could not have my husband die. But these\nwords seemed to be impressed on my mind: \u201cBe still, and know\nthat I am God.\u201d I keenly feel my loss, but dare not give myself up to\nDeath of My Husband 103\nuseless grief. This would not bring back the dead. And I am not so\nselfish as to wish, if I could, to bring him from his peaceful slumber\nto engage again in the battles of life. Like a tired warrior, he has\nlain down to sleep. I will look with pleasure upon his resting place.\nThe best way in which I and my children can honor the memory of\nhim who has fallen, is to take the work where he left it, and in the\nstrength of Jesus carry it forward to completion. We will be thankful\nfor the years of usefulness that were granted to him; and for his sake,\nand for Christ\u2019s sake, we will learn from his death a lesson which\nwe shall never forget. We will let this bereavement make us more\nkind and gentle, more forbearing, patient, and thoughtful toward the\nliving.\nI take up my lifework alone, in full confidence that my Redeemer\nwill be with me. We have only a little while to wage the warfare; [112]\nthen Christ will come, and this scene of conflict will close. Then our\nlast efforts will have been made to work with Christ, and advance\nHis kingdom. Some who have stood in the forefront of the battle,\nzealously resisting incoming evil, fall at the post of duty; the living\ngaze sorrowfully at the fallen heroes, but there is no time to cease\nwork. They must close up the ranks; seize the banner from the hand\npalsied by death, and with renewed energy vindicate the truth and the\nhonor of Christ. As never before, resistance must be made against\nsin\u2014against the powers of darkness. The time demands energetic\nand determined activity on the part of those who believe present\ntruth. If the time seems long to wait for our Deliverer to come; if,\nbowed by affliction and worn with toil, we feel impatient to receive\nan honorable release from the warfare, let us remember\u2014and let\nthe remembrance check every murmur\u2014that we are left on earth\nto encounter storms and conflicts, to perfect Christian character,\nto become better acquainted with God our Father, and Christ our\nElder Brother, and to do work for the Master in winning many souls\nto Christ. \u201cThey that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the\nfirmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for\never and ever.\u201d\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber One\u2014Testimony for the Church [113]\nChapter 15\u2014Thy Brother\u2019s Keeper\nNovember 20, 1855, while in prayer, the Spirit of the Lord came\nsuddenly and powerfully upon me, and I was taken off in vision.\nI saw that the Spirit of the Lord has been dying away from the\nchurch. The servants of the Lord have trusted too much to the\nstrength of argument, and have not had that firm reliance upon God\nwhich they should have. I saw that the mere argument of the truth\nwill not move souls to take a stand with the remnant; for the truth\nis unpopular. The servants of God must have the truth in the soul.\nSaid the angel: \u201cThey must get it warm from glory, carry it in their\nbosoms, and pour it out in the warmth and earnestness of the soul\nto those that hear.\u201d A few that are conscientious are ready to decide\nfrom the weight of evidence; but it is impossible to move many with\na mere theory of the truth. There must be a power to attend the truth,\na living testimony to move them.\nI saw that the enemy is busy to destroy souls. Exaltation has\ncome into the ranks; there must be more humility. There is too much\nof an independence of spirit indulged in among the messengers.\nThis must be laid aside, and there must be a drawing together of the\nservants of God. There has been too much of a spirit to ask, \u201cAm I\nmy brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d Said the angel: \u201cYea,thou art thy brother\u2019s\nkeeper. Thou shouldest have a watchful care for thy brother, be[114]\ninterested for his welfare, and cherish a kind, loving spirit toward\nhim. Press together, press together.\u201d God designed that man should\nbe openhearted and honest, without affectation, meek, humble, with\nsimplicity. This is the principle of heaven; God ordered it so. But\npoor, frail man has sought out something different\u2014to follow his\nown way, and carefully attend to his own self-interest.\nI asked the angel why simplicity had been shut out from the\nchurch, and pride and exaltation had come in. I saw that this is\nthe reason why we have almost been delivered into the hand of the\nenemy. Said the angel: \u201cLook ye, and ye shall see that this feeling\nprevails: Am I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d Again said the angel: \u201cThou\n106\nThy Brother\u2019s Keeper 107\nart thy brother\u2019s keeper. Thy profession, thy faith, requires thee\nto deny thyself and sacrifice to God, or thou wilt be unworthy of\neternal life; for it was purchased for thee dearly, even by the agony,\nthe sufferings, and blood of the beloved Son of God.\u201d\nI saw that many in different places, East and West, were adding\nfarm to farm, and land to land, and house to house, and they make\nthe cause of God their excuse, saying they do this that they may help\nthe cause. They shackle themselves so that they can be of but little\nbenefit to the cause. Some buy a piece of land, and labor with all\ntheir might to pay for it. Their time is so occupied that they can spare\nbut little time to pray, and serve God, and gain strength from Him to\novercome their besetments. They are in debt, and when the cause\nneeds their help they cannot assist; for they must get free from debt\nfirst. But as soon as they are free from debt they are farther from\nhelping the cause than before; for they again involve themselves by\nadding to their property. They flatter themselves that this course is\nright, that they will use the avails in the cause, when they are actually\nlaying up treasure here. They love the truth in word, but not in work.\nThey love the cause just as much as their works show. They love the [115]\nworld more and the cause of God less; the attraction to earth grows\nstronger and the attraction to heaven weaker. Their heart is with\ntheir treasure. By their example they say to those around them that\nthey are intending to stay here, that this world is their home. Said\nthe angel: \u201cThou art thy brother\u2019s keeper.\u201d\nMany have indulged in needless expense, merely to gratify the\nfeelings, the taste, and the eye, when the cause needed the very\nmeans thus used, and when some of the servants of God were poorly\nclothed and were crippled in their labor for lack of means. Said the\nangel: \u201cTheir time to do will soon be past. Their works show that\nself is their idol, and to it they sacrifice.\u201d Self must first be gratified;\ntheir feeling is: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d Warning after warning\nmany have received, but heeded not. Self is the main object, and to\nit everything must bow.\nI saw that the church has nearly lost the spirit of self-denial and\nsacrifice; they make self and self-interest first, and then they do for\nthe cause what they think they can as well as not. Such a sacrifice,\nI saw, is lame, and not accepted of God. All should be interested\nto do their utmost to advance the cause. I saw that those who have\n108 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nno property, but have strength of body, are accountable to God for\ntheir strength. They should be diligent in business and fervent in\nspirit; they should not leave those that have possessions to do all the\nsacrificing. I saw that they can sacrifice, and that it is their duty to\ndo so, as well as those who have property. But often those that have\nno possessions do not realize that they can deny themselves in many\nways, can lay out less upon their bodies, and to gratify their tastes\nand appetites, and find much to spare for the cause, and thus lay up\na treasure in heaven. I saw that there is loveliness and beauty in the\ntruth; but take away the power of God, and it is powerless.\nChapter 16\u2014Time to Begin the Sabbath [116]\n[See Appendix.]\nI saw that it is even so: \u201cFrom even unto even, shall ye celebrate\nyour Sabbath.\u201d Said the angel: \u201cTake the word of God, read it,\nunderstand, and ye cannot err. Read carefully, and ye shall there\nfind what even is, and when it is.\u201d I asked the angel if the frown of\nGod had been upon His people for commencing the Sabbath as they\nhad. I was directed back to the first rise of the Sabbath, and followed\nthe people of God up to this time, but did not see that the Lord was\ndispleased, or frowned upon them. I inquired why it had been thus,\nthat at this late day we must change the time of commencing the\nSabbath. Said the angel: \u201cYe shall understand, but not yet, not yet.\u201d\nSaid the angel: \u201cIf light come, and that light is set aside or rejected,\nthen comes condemnation and the frown of God; but before the light\ncomes, there is no sin, for there is no light for them to reject.\u201d I saw\nthat it was in the minds of some that the Lord had shown that the\nSabbath commenced at six o\u2019clock, when I had only seen that it\ncommenced at \u201ceven,\u201d and it was inferred that even was at six. I saw\nthat the servants of God must draw together, press together.\n* * * * *\n109\nChapter 17\u2014Opposers of the Truth\n[See Appendix.]\nI was shown the case of Stephenson and Hall of Wisconsin. I\nsaw that while we were in Wisconsin, in June, 1854, they were\nconvicted that the visions were of God; but they examined them and\ncompared them with their views of the age to come, and because\nthe visions did not agree with these, they sacrificed the visions for\nthe Age-to-Come. And while on their journey East, last spring,\nthey both were wrong and designing. They have stumbled over the\nAge-to-Come, and they are ready to take any course to injure the[117]\nReview; its friends must be awake and do what they can to save\nthe children of God from deception. These men are uniting with\na lying and corrupt people. They have had evidence of this. And\nwhile they were professing sympathy and union with my husband,\nthey (especially Stephenson) were biting like an adder behind his\nback. While their words were smooth with him, they were inflaming\nWisconsin against the Review and its conductors. Especially was\nStephenson active in this matter. Their object has been to have the\nReview publish the Age-to-Come theory, or to destroy its influence.\nAnd while my husband was openhearted and unsuspecting, seeking\nways to remove their jealousy, and frankly opening to them the\naffairs of the office, and trying to help them, they were watching for\nevil, and observing everything with a jealous eye. Said the angel as\nI beheld them: \u201cThink ye, feeble man, that ye can stay the work of\nGod? Feeble man, one touch of His finger can lay thee prostrate. He\nwill suffer thee but a little while.\u201d\nI was pointed back to the rise of the advent doctrine, and even\nbefore that time, and saw that there had not been a parallel to the\ndeception, misrepresentation, and falsehood that has been practiced\nby the Messenger party, or such an association of corrupt hearts\nunder a cloak of religion. Some honest hearts have been influenced\nby them, concluding that they must have at least some cause for\n110\nOpposers of the Truth 111\ntheir statements, thinking them incapable of uttering so glaring\nfalsehoods. I saw that such will have evidence of the truth of these\nmatters. The church of God should move straight along, as though\nthere were not such a people in the world.\nI saw that decided efforts should be made to show those who\nare unchristian in life their wrongs, and if they do not reform, they\nshould be separated from the precious and holy, that God may have\na clean and pure people that He can delight in. Dishonor Him not [118]\nby linking or uniting the clean with the unclean.\nI was shown some coming from the East to the West. I saw that\nit should not be the object of those who leave the East for the West\nto get rich, but to win souls to the truth. Said the angel: \u201cLet your\nworks show that it is not for honor, or to lay up a treasure on earth,\nthat ye have moved West, but to hold up and exalt the standard of\ntruth.\u201d I saw that those who move West should be like men waiting\nfor their Lord. Said the angel: \u201cBe a living example to those in the\nWest. Let your works show that you are God\u2019s peculiar people, and\nthat you have a peculiar work, to give the last message of mercy to\nthe world. Let your works show to those around you that this world\nis not your home.\u201d I saw that those who have entangled themselves\nshould break the snare of the enemy and go free. Lay not up treasures\nupon earth, but show by your lives that you are laying up treasure in\nheaven. If God has called you West, He has a work, an exalted work,\nfor you to do. Let your faith and experience help those who have not\na living experience. Let not the attraction be to this poor, dark speck\nof a world, but let it be upward to God, glory, and heaven. Let not\nthe care and perplexity of farms here engross your mind, but you\ncan safely be wrapped up in contemplating Abraham\u2019s farm. We are\nheirs to that immortal inheritance. Wean your affections from earth,\nand dwell upon heavenly things.\n* * * * *\nChapter 18\u2014Parental Responsibility\nI saw that great responsibility rests upon parents. They must\nnot be led by their children, but must lead them. I was referred\nto Abraham. He was faithful in his house. He commanded his\nhousehold after him, and it was remembered of God.\nI was then referred to the case of Eli. He restrained not his[119]\nchildren, and they became wicked and vile, and by their wickedness\nled Israel astray. When God had made known to Samuel their sins,\nand the heavy curse that was to follow because Eli restrained them\nnot, He said that their sins should not be purged with sacrifice nor\noffering forever. When told by Samuel what the Lord had shown\nhim, Eli submitted, saying: \u201cIt is the Lord: let Him do what seemeth\nHim good.\u201d The curse of God soon followed. Those wicked priests\nwere slain, and thirty thousand of Israel were also slain, and the\nark of God was taken by their enemies. And when Eli heard that\nthe ark of God was taken, he fell backward and died. All this evil\nresulted from Eli\u2019s neglect to restrain his sons. I saw that if God was\nso particular as to notice such things anciently, He will be no less\nparticular in these last days.\nParents must govern their children, correct their passions, and\nsubdue them, or God will surely destroy the children in the day\nof His fierce anger, and the parents who have not controlled their\nchildren will not be blameless. Especially should the servants of\nGod govern their own families and have them in good subjection. I\nsaw that they are not prepared to judge or decide in matters of the\nchurch, unless they can rule well their own house. They must first\nhave order at home, and then their judgment and influence will tell\nin the church.\nI saw that the reason why visions have not been more frequent\nof late, is, they have not been appreciated by the church. The church\nhave nearly lost their spirituality and faith, and the reproofs and\nwarnings have had but little effect upon them. Many of those who\nhave professed faith in them have not heeded them.\n112\nParental Responsibility 113\nSome have taken an injudicious course; when they have talked\ntheir faith to unbelievers, and the proof has been asked for, they have\nread a vision, instead of going to the Bible for proof. I saw that this\ncourse was inconsistent, and prejudiced unbelievers against the truth. [120]\nThe visions can have no weight with those who have never seen\nthem and know nothing of their spirit. They should not be referred\nto in such cases.\n* * * * *\nChapter 19\u2014Faith in God\nWhen at Battle Creek, Michigan, May 5, 1855, I saw that there\nwas a great lack of faith with the servants of God, as well as with\nthe church. They were too easily discouraged, too ready to doubt\nGod, too willing to believe that they had a hard lot and that God had\nforsaken them. I saw that this was cruel. God so loved them as to give\nHis dearly beloved Son to die for them, and all heaven was interested\nin their salvation; yet after all that had been done for them, it was\nhard to believe and trust so kind and good a Father. He has said that\nHe is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him, than\nearthly parents are to give good gifts to their children. I saw that the\nservants of God and the church were too easily discouraged. When\nthey asked their Father in heaven for things which they thought they\nneeded, and these did not immediately come, their faith wavered,\ntheir courage fled, and a murmuring feeling took possession of them.\nThis, I saw, displeased God.\nEvery saint who comes to God with a true heart, and sends his\nhonest petitions to Him in faith, will have his prayers answered.\nYour faith must not let go of the promises of God, if you do not see\nor feel the immediate answer to your prayers. Be not afraid to trust\nGod. Rely upon His sure promise: \u201cAsk, and ye shall receive.\u201d God\nis too wise to err, and too good to withhold any good thing from His\nsaints that walk uprightly. Man is erring, and although his petitions\nare sent up from an honest heart, he does not always ask for the\nthings that are good for himself, or that will glorify God. When this\nis so, our wise and good Father hears our prayers, and will answer,[121]\nsometimes immediately; but He gives us the things that are for our\nbest good and His own glory. God gives us blessings; if we could\nlook into His plan, we would clearly see that He knows what is best\nfor us and that our prayers are answered. Nothing hurtful is given,\nbut the blessing we need, in the place of something we asked for\nthat would not be good for us, but to our hurt.\n114\nFaith in God 115\nI saw that if we do not feel immediate answers to our prayers,\nwe should hold fast our faith, not allowing distrust to come in, for\nthat will separate us from God. If our faith wavers, we shall receive\nnothing from Him. Our confidence in God should be strong; and\nwhen we need it most, the blessing will fall upon us like a shower of\nrain.\nWhen the servants of God pray for His Spirit and blessing, it\nsometimes comes immediately; but it is not always then bestowed.\nAt such times, faint not. Let your faith hold fast the promise that it\nwill come. Let your trust be fully in God, and often that blessing\nwill come when you need it most, and you will unexpectedly receive\nhelp from God when you are presenting the truth to unbelievers, and\nwill be enabled to speak the word with clearness and power.\nIt was represented to me like children asking a blessing of their\nearthly parents who love them. They ask something that the parent\nknows will hurt them; the parent gives them the things that will be\ngood and healthful for them, in the place of that which they desired.\nI saw that every prayer which is sent up in faith from an honest heart\nwill be heard of God and answered, and the one that sent up the\npetition will have the blessing when he needs it most, and it will\noften exceed his expectations. Not a prayer of a true saint is lost if\nsent up in faith from an honest heart.\nChapter 20\u2014The \u201cMessenger\u201d Party[122]\n[See Appendix.]\nWhen at Oswego, New York, June, 1855, I was shown that God\u2019s\npeople have been weighed down with clogs; that there have been\nAchans in the camp. The work of God has progressed but little, and\nmany of His servants have been discouraged because the truth has\ntaken no more effect in New York, and there have been no more\nadded to the church. The Messenger party has arisen, and we shall\nsuffer some from their lying tongues and misrepresentations, yet we\nshould bear it all patiently; for they will not injure the cause of God,\nnow they have left us, as much as they would have injured it by their\ninfluence had they remained with us.\nGod\u2019s frown has been brought upon the church on account of\nindividuals with corrupt hearts being in it. They have wanted to be\nforemost, when neither God nor their brethren placed them there.\nSelfishness and exaltation have marked their course. A place is now\nopen for all such where they can go and find pasture with those\nof their kind. And we should praise God that in mercy He has rid\nthe church of them. God has given many of these persons up to\ntheir own ways to be filled with their own doings. An excitement\nand sympathy now leads them, which will deceive some; but every\nhonest one will be enlightened as to the true state of this company,\nand will remain with God\u2019s peculiar people, hold fast the truth, and\nfollow in the humble path, unaffected by the influence of those who\nhave been given up of God to their own ways, to be filled with their\nown doings. I saw that God had given these persons opportunity to\nreform, He had enlightened them as to their love for self and their\nother sins; but they would not heed it. They would not be reformed,\nand He mercifully relieved the church of them. The truth will take\neffect if the servants of God and the church will devote themselves\nto Him and His cause.\nI saw that the people of God must arouse and put on the armor.[123]\n116\n\u201cMessenger\u201d Party 117\nChrist is coming, and the great work of the last message of mercy is\nof too much importance for us to leave it and come down to answer\nsuch falsehoods, misrepresentations, and slanders as the Messenger\nparty have fed upon and have scattered abroad. Truth, present truth,\nwe must dwell upon it. We are doing a great work, and cannot come\ndown. Satan is in all this, to divert our minds from the present truth\nand the coming of Christ. Said the angel: \u201cJesus knows it all.\u201d In\na little from this their day is coming. All will be judged according\nto the deeds done in the body. The lying tongue will be stopped.\nThe sinners in Zion will be afraid, and fearfulness will surprise the\nhypocrites.\n* * * * *\nChapter 21\u2014Prepare to Meet the Lord\nI saw that we should not put off the coming of the Lord. Said\nthe angel: \u201cPrepare, prepare, for what is coming upon the earth.\nLet your works correspond with your faith.\u201d I saw that the mind\nmust be stayed upon God, and that our influence should tell for God\nand His truth. We cannot honor the Lord when we are careless and\nindifferent. We cannot glorify Him when we are desponding. We\nmust be in earnest to secure our own soul\u2019s salvation, and to save\nothers. All importance should be attached to this, and everything\nbesides should come in secondary.\nI saw the beauty of heaven. I heard the angels sing their rapturous\nsongs, ascribing praise, honor, and glory to Jesus. I could then realize\nsomething of the wondrous love of the Son of God. He left all the\nglory, all the honor which He had in heaven, and was so interested for\nour salvation that He patiently and meekly bore every indignity and\nslight which man could heap upon Him. He was wounded, smitten,\nand bruised; He was stretched on Calvary\u2019s cross and suffered the[124]\nmost agonizing death to save us from death, that we might be washed\nin His blood and be raised up to live with Him in the mansions He\nis preparing for us, to enjoy the light and glory of heaven, to hear\nthe angels sing, and to sing with them.\nI saw that all heaven is interested in our salvation; and shall we\nbe indifferent? Shall we be careless, as though it were a small matter\nwhether we are saved or lost? Shall we slight the sacrifice that has\nbeen made for us? Some have done this. They have trifled with\noffered mercy, and the frown of God is upon them. God\u2019s Spirit\nwill not always be grieved. It will depart if grieved a little longer.\nAfter all has been done that God could do to save men, if they show\nby their lives that they slight Jesus\u2019 offered mercy, death will be\ntheir portion, and it will be dearly purchased. It will be a dreadful\ndeath; for they will have to feel the agony that Christ felt upon the\ncross to purchase for them the redemption which they have refused.\nAnd they will then realize what they have lost\u2014eternal life and the\n118\nPrepare to Meet the Lord 119\nimmortal inheritance. The great sacrifice that has been made to save\nsouls shows us their worth. When the precious soul is once lost, it is\nlost forever.\nI have seen an angel standing with scales in his hands weighing\nthe thoughts and interest of the people of God, especially the young.\nIn one scale were the thoughts and interest tending heavenward; in\nthe other were the thoughts and interest tending to earth. And in\nthis scale were thrown all the reading of storybooks, thoughts of\ndress and show, vanity, pride, etc. Oh, what a solemn moment! the\nangels of God standing with scales, weighing the thoughts of His\nprofessed children\u2014those who claim to be dead to the world and\nalive to God. The scale filled with thoughts of earth, vanity, and\npride quickly went down, notwithstanding weight after weight rolled\nfrom the scale. The one with the thoughts and interest tending to\nheaven went quickly up as the other went down, and oh, how light it [125]\nwas! I can relate this as I saw it; but never can I give the solemn and\nvivid impression stamped upon my mind, as I saw the angel with\nthe scales weighing the thoughts and interest of the people of God.\nSaid the angel: \u201cCan such enter heaven? No, no, never. Tell them\nthe hope they now possess is vain, and unless they speedily repent,\nand obtain salvation, they must perish.\u201d\nA form of godliness will not save any. All must have a deep and\nliving experience. This alone will save them in the time of trouble.\nThen their work will be tried of what sort it is; and if it is gold, silver,\nand precious stones, they will be hid as in the secret of the Lord\u2019s\npavilion. But if their work is wood, hay, and stubble, nothing can\nshield them from the fierceness of Jehovah\u2019s wrath.\nThe young, as well as those who are older, will be required\nto give a reason for their hope. But the mind, designed by God\nfor better things, formed to serve Him perfectly, has dwelt upon\nfoolish things, instead of eternal interests. That mind which is left\nto wander here and there is just as well able to understand the truth,\nthe evidence from the word of God for keeping the Sabbath, and the\ntrue foundation of the Christian\u2019s hope, as to study the appearance,\nthe manners, the dress, etc. And those who give up the mind to be\ndiverted with foolish stories and idle tales, have the imagination fed,\nbut the brilliancy of God\u2019s word is eclipsed to them. The mind is led\ndirectly from God. The interest in His precious word is destroyed.\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nA book has been given us to guide our feet through the perils of\nthis dark world to heaven. It tells us how we can escape the wrath\nof God, and also tells of the sufferings of Christ for us, the great\nsacrifice that has been made that we might be saved and enjoy the\npresence of God forever. And if any come short at last, having heard\nthe truth as they have in this land of light, it will be their own fault;\nthey will be without excuse. The word of God tells us how we may[126]\nbecome perfect Christians and escape the seven last plagues. But\nthey took no interest to find this out. Other things diverted the mind,\nidols were cherished by them, and God\u2019s Holy Word was neglected\nand slighted. God has been trifled with by professed Christians, and\nwhen His Holy Word shall judge them in the last day, they will be\nfound wanting. That word which they have neglected for foolish\nstorybooks, tries their lives. That is the standard; their motives,\nwords, works, and the manner in which they use their time are all\ncompared with the written word of God; and if they come short then,\ntheir cases are decided forever.\nI saw that many measure themselves among themselves, and\ncompare their lives with the lives of others. This should not be. No\none but Christ is given us as an example. He is our true Pattern, and\neach should strive to excel in imitating Him. We are co-workers\nwith Christ, or co-workers with the enemy. We either gather with\nChrist or scatter abroad. We are decided, wholehearted Christians,\nor none at all. Says Christ: \u201cI would thou wert cold or hot. So then\nbecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew\nthee out of My mouth.\u201d\nI saw that some hardly know as yet what self-denial or sacrifice is,\nor what it is to suffer for the truth\u2019s sake. But none will enter heaven\nwithout making a sacrifice. A spirit of self-denial and sacrifice\nshould be cherished. Some have not sacrificed themselves, their own\nbodies, on the altar of God. They indulge in hasty, fitful temper,\ngratify their appetites, and attend to their own self-interest, regardless\nof the cause of God. Those who are willing to make any sacrifice\nfor eternal life, will have it; and it will be worth suffering for, worth\ncrucifying self for, and sacrificing every idol for. The far more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory swallows up everything and\neclipses every earthly pleasure.\nNumber Two\u2014Testimony for the Church [127]\nChapter 22\u2014The Two Ways\nAt the Conference at Battle Creek, May 27, 1856, I was shown\nin vision some things that concern the church generally. The glory\nand majesty of God were made to pass before me. Said the angel:\n\u201cHe is terrible in His majesty, yet ye realize it not; terrible in His\nanger, yet ye offend Him daily. \u2018Strive to enter in at the strait gate;\u2019\n\u2018for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,\nand many there be which go in thereat: because strait is the gate, and\nnarrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find\nit.\u2019\u201d These roads are distinct, separate, in opposite directions. One\nleads to eternal life, the other to eternal death. I saw the distinction\nbetween these roads, also the distinction between the companies\ntraveling them. The roads are opposite; one is broad and smooth, the\nother narrow and rugged. So the parties that travel them are opposite\nin character, in life, in dress, and in conversation.\nThose who travel in the narrow way are talking of the joy and\nhappiness they will have at the end of the journey. Their counte-\nnances are often sad, yet often beam with holy, sacred joy. They do\nnot dress like the company in the broad road, nor talk like them, nor\nact like them. A pattern has been given them. A man of sorrows\nand acquainted with grief opened that road for them, and traveled[128]\nit Himself. His followers see His footsteps, and are comforted and\ncheered. He went through safely; so can they, if they follow in His\nfootsteps.\nIn the broad road all are occupied with their persons, their dress,\nand the pleasures in the way. They indulge freely in hilarity and glee,\nand think not of their journey\u2019s end, of the certain destruction at the\nend of the path. Every day they approach nearer their destruction; yet\nthey madly rush on faster and faster. Oh, how dreadful this looked\nto me!\nI saw many traveling in this broad road who had the words\nwritten upon them: \u201cDead to the world. The end of all things\nis at hand. Be ye also ready.\u201d They looked just like all the vain\n122\nTwo Ways 123\nones around them, except a shade of sadness which I noticed upon\ntheir countenances. Their conversation was just like that of the gay,\nthoughtless ones around them; but they would occasionally point\nwith great satisfaction to the letters on their garments, calling for\nthe others to have the same upon theirs. They were in the broad\nway, yet they professed to be of the number who were traveling the\nnarrow way. Those around them would say: \u201cThere is no distinction\nbetween us. We are alike; we dress, and talk, and act alike.\u201d\nThen I was pointed back to the years 1843 and 1844. There was\na spirit of consecration then that there is not now. What has come\nover the professed peculiar people of God? I saw the conformity\nto the world, the unwillingness to suffer for the truth\u2019s sake. I saw\na great lack of submission to the will of God. I was pointed back\nto the children of Israel after they left Egypt. God in mercy called\nthem out from the Egyptians, that they might worship Him without\nhindrance or restraint. He wrought for them in the way by miracles,\nHe proved and tried them by bringing them into strait places. After\nthe wonderful dealings of God with them, and their deliverance so\nmany times, they murmured when tried or proved by Him. Their [129]\nlanguage was: \u201cWould to God we had died by the hand of the Lord\nin the land of Egypt.\u201d They lusted for the leeks and onions there.\nI saw that many who profess to believe the truth for these last\ndays think it strange that the children of Israel murmured as they\njourneyed; that after the wonderful dealings of God with them, they\nshould be so ungrateful as to forget what He had done for them.\nSaid the angel: \u201cYe have done worse than they.\u201d I saw that God\nhas given His servants the truth so clear, so plain, that it cannot\nbe resisted. Wherever they go, they have certain victory. Their\nenemies cannot get round the convincing truth. Light has been\nshed so clear that the servants of God can stand up anywhere and\nlet truth, clear and connected, bear away the victory. This great\nblessing has not been prized, or even realized. If any trial arises,\nsome begin to look back and think they have a hard time. Some\nof the professed servants of God do not know what purifying trials\nare. They sometimes make trials for themselves, imagine trials, and\nare so easily discouraged, so easily hurt, self-dignity is so quick to\nfeel, that they injure themselves, injure others, and injure the cause.\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nSatan magnifies their trials and puts thoughts into their minds that if\ngiven way to, will destroy their influence and usefulness.\nSome have felt tempted to take themselves from the work, to\nlabor with their hands. I saw that if the hand of God should be\ntaken from them, and they be left subject to disease and death, then\nthey would know what trouble is. It is a fearful thing to murmur\nagainst God. They do not bear in mind that the way which they are\ntraveling is a rugged, self-denying, self-crucifying way, and they\nmust not expect everything to move on as smoothly as though they\nwere traveling in the broad road.\nI saw that some of the servants of God, even ministers, are\nso easily discouraged, self is so quickly hurt, that they imagine\nthemselves slighted and injured when it is not so. They think their[130]\nlot hard. Such realize not how they would feel should the sustaining\nhand of God be withdrawn, and they pass through anguish of soul.\nThey would then find their lot tenfold harder than it was before,\nwhile they were employed in the work of God, suffering trials and\nprivations, yet withal having the Lord\u2019s approbation. Some that\nare laboring in the cause of God know not when they do have an\neasy time. They have had so few privations and know so little of\nwant or wearing labor or burden of soul that when they have an easy\ntime, when they are favored of God and almost entirely free from\nanguish of spirit, they know it not and think their trials great. I saw\nthat unless such have a spirit of self-sacrifice, and are ready to labor\ncheerfully, not sparing themselves, God will release them. He will\nnot acknowledge them as His self-sacrificing servants, but will raise\nup those who will labor, not slothfully, but in earnest, and will know\nwhen they have an easy time. God\u2019s servants must feel the burden\nof souls and weep between the porch and the altar, crying: \u201cSpare\nThy people, O Lord.\u201d\nSome of the servants of God have given up their lives to spend\nand be spent for the cause of God, until their constitutions are broken\ndown, and they are almost worn out with mental labor, incessant\ncare, toil, and privations. Others have not had and would not take\nthe burden upon them. Yet just such ones think they have a hard\ntime, because they have never experienced hardships. They never\nhave been baptized into the suffering part, and never will be as long\nas they manifest so much weakness and so little fortitude, and love\nTwo Ways 125\ntheir ease so well. From what God has shown me, there needs to be\na scourging among the ministers, that the slothful, dilatory, and self-\ncaring ones may be scourged out, and there remain a pure, faithful,\nand self-sacrificing company who will not study their ease, but will\nminister faithfully in word and doctrine, willing to suffer and endure\nall things for Christ\u2019s sake, and to save those for whom He died. Let [131]\nthese servants feel the woe upon them if they preach not the gospel,\nand it will be enough; but all do not feel this.\n* * * * *\nChapter 23\u2014Conformity to the World\nI was shown the conformity of some professed Sabbathkeepers\nto the world. Oh, I saw that it is a disgrace to their profession, a\ndisgrace to the cause of God. They give the lie to their profession.\nThey think they are not like the world, but they are so near like them\nin dress, in conversation, and actions, that there is no distinction.\nI saw them decorating their poor, mortal bodies, which are liable\nat any moment to be touched by the finger of God and laid upon a\nbed of anguish. Oh, then, as they approach their last change, mortal\nanguish racks their frames, and the great inquiry is: \u201cAm I prepared\nto die? prepared to appear before God in judgment, and pass the\ngrand review?\u201d Ask them then how they feel about decorating their\nbodies, and if they have any sense of what it is to be prepared to\nappear before God, they will tell you that if they could take back\nand live over the past, they would correct their lives, shun the follies\nof the world, its vanity and pride, and would adorn the body with\nmodest apparel, and set an example to all around them. They would\nlive to the glory of God.\nWhy is it so hard to lead a self-denying, humble life? Because\nprofessed Christians are not dead to the world. It is easy living after\nwe are dead. But many are longing for the leeks and onions of Egypt.\nThey have a disposition to dress and act as much like the world as\npossible and yet go to heaven. Such climb up some other way. They\ndo not enter through the strait gate and narrow way.\nI was shown the company present at the Conference. Said the[132]\nangel: \u201cSome food for worms, [Sister Clarissa M. Bonfoey, who\nfell asleep in Jesus only three days after this vision was given, was\npresent in usual health, and was deeply impressed that she was one\nwho would go into the grave, and stated her convictions to others.]\nsome subjects of the seven last plagues, some will be alive and\nremain upon the earth to be translated at the coming of Jesus.\u201d\nSolemn words were these, spoken by the angel. I asked the angel\nwhy so few were interested in their eternal welfare, so few preparing\n126\nConformity to the World 127\nfor their last change. Said he: \u201cEarth attracts them, its treasures\nseem of worth to them.\u201d They find enough to engross the mind, and\nhave no time to prepare for heaven. Satan is ever ready to plunge\nthem deeper and deeper into difficulty; as soon as one perplexity and\ntrouble is off the mind, he begets within them an unholy desire for\nmore of the things of earth; and thus their time passes, and, when it\nis too late, they see that they have gained nothing substantial. They\nhave grasped at shadows and lost eternal life. Such will have no\nexcuse.\nMany dress like the world, to have an influence. But here they\nmake a sad and fatal mistake. If they would have a true and saving\ninfluence, let them live out their profession, show their faith by\ntheir righteous works, and make the distinction great between the\nChristian and the world. I saw that the words, the dress, and actions\nshould tell for God. Then a holy influence will be shed upon all,\nand all will take knowledge of them that they have been with Jesus.\nUnbelievers will see that the truth we profess has a holy influence\nand that faith in Christ\u2019s coming affects the character of the man or\nwoman. If any wish to have their influence tell in favor of the truth,\nlet them live it out and thus imitate the humble Pattern.\nI saw that God hates pride, and that all the proud and all that do\nwickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them\nup. I saw that the third angel\u2019s message must yet work like leaven [133]\nupon many hearts that profess to believe it, and purge away their\npride, selfishness, covetousness, and love of the world.\nJesus is coming; and will He find a people conformed to the\nworld? and will He acknowledge these as His people that He has\npurified unto Himself? Oh, no. None but the pure and holy will He\nacknowledge as His. Those who have been purified and made white\nthrough suffering, and have kept themselves separate, unspotted\nfrom the world, He will own as His.\nAs I saw the dreadful fact that God\u2019s people were conformed to\nthe world, with no distinction, except in name, between many of the\nprofessed disciples of the meek and lowly Jesus and unbelievers, my\nsoul felt deep anguish. I saw that Jesus was wounded and put to an\nopen shame. Said the angel, as with sorrow he saw the professed\npeople of God loving the world, partaking of its spirit, and following\nits fashions: \u201cCut loose! Cut loose! lest He appoint you your portion\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwith hypocrites and unbelievers outside the city. Your profession\nwill only cause you greater anguish, and your punishment will be\ngreater because ye knew His will, but did it not.\u201d\nThose who profess to believe the third angel\u2019s message often\nwound the cause of God by lightness, joking, and trifling. I was\nshown that this evil was all through our ranks. There should be a\nhumbling before the Lord; the Israel of God should rend the heart,\nand not the garment. Childlike simplicity is rarely seen; the appro-\nbation of man is more thought of than the displeasure of God. Said\nthe angel: \u201cSet your heart in order, lest He visit you in judgment,\nand the brittle thread of life be cut, and ye lie down in the grave\nunsheltered, unprepared for the judgment. Or if ye do not make your\nbed in the grave, unless ye soon make your peace with God, and tear\nyourselves from the world, your hearts will grow harder, and ye will\nlean upon a false prop, a supposed preparation, and find out your[134]\nmistake too late to secure a well-grounded hope.\u201d\nI saw that some professed Sabbathkeepers spend hours that are\nworse than thrown away, in studying this or that fashion to decorate\nthe poor, mortal body. While you make yourselves appear like the\nworld, and as beautiful as you can, remember that the same body\nmay in a few days be food for worms. And while you adorn it to your\ntaste, to please the eye, you are dying spiritually. God hates your\nvain, wicked pride, and He looks upon you as a whited sepulcher,\nfull of corruption and uncleanness within.\nMothers set the example of pride for their children, and, by so\ndoing, sow seed that will spring up and bear fruit. The harvest will\nbe plenteous and sure. That which they sow, they shall reap. There\nwill be no failure in the crop. I saw, parents, that it is easier for you\nto teach your children a lesson of pride, than a lesson of humility.\nSatan and his angels stand right by your side to make the act of\nyours, or the word that you speak to them, effectual to encourage\nthem to dress, and in their pride to mingle with society that is not\nholy. O parents, you plant in your own bosoms a thorn that you will\noften feel in anguish. When you would counteract the sad lesson\nyou have taught your children, you will find it a hard thing. It is\nimpossible for you to do this. You may deny them things that would\ngratify their pride, yet it still lives in the heart, longing to be satisfied;\nand nothing can kill this pride but the quick and powerful Spirit of\nConformity to the World 129\nGod. When this finds its way to the heart, it will work like leaven\nthere and root it out.\nI saw that young and old neglect the Bible. They do not make\nthat book their study and their rule of life as they should. Especially\nare the young guilty of this neglect. Most of them are ready, and\nfind plenty of time, to read almost any other book. But the word\nthat points to life, eternal life, is not perused and daily studied. That [135]\nprecious, important book that is to judge them in the last day is\nscarcely studied at all. Idle stories have been attentively read, while\nthe Bible has been passed by neglected. A day is coming, a day\nof clouds and thick darkness, when all will wish to be thoroughly\nfurnished by the plain, simple truths of the word of God, that they\nmay meekly, yet decidedly, give a reason of their hope. This reason\nof their hope, I saw, they must have to strengthen their own souls for\nthe fierce conflict. Without this they are wanting, and cannot have\nfirmness and decision.\nParents would better burn the idle tales of the day and the novels\nas they come into their houses. It would be a mercy to the children.\nEncourage the reading of these storybooks, and it is like enchant-\nment. It bewilders and poisons the mind. Parents, I saw that unless\nyou awake to the eternal interest of your children, they will surely be\nlost through your neglect. And the possibility that unfaithful parents\nwill be saved themselves is very small. Parents should be exemplary.\nThey should exert a holy influence in their families. They should\nlet their dress be modest, different from the world around them. As\nthey value the eternal interest of their children, they should rebuke\npride in them, faithfully rebuke it, and encourage it not in word or\ndeed. Oh, the pride that was shown me of God\u2019s professed people!\nIt has increased every year, until it is now impossible to designate\nprofessed advent Sabbathkeepers from all the world around them. I\nsaw that this pride must be torn out of our families.\nMuch has been expended for ribbons and laces for the bonnets,\nfor collars [The question has often been asked me if I believed it\nwrong to wear plain linen collars. My answer has always been\nNo. Some have taken the extreme meaning of what I have written\nabout collars, and have maintained that it is wrong to wear one of any\ndescription. I was shown expensively wrought collars, and expensive\nand unnecessary ribbons and laces, which some Sabbathkeepers have\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nworn, and still wear for the sake of show and fashion. In mentioning\ncollars, I did not design to be understood that nothing like a collar\nshould be worn, or, in mentioning ribbons, that no ribbons at all\nshould be worn. E. G. W., note to second edition.] and other needless\narticles to decorate the body, while Jesus the King of glory, who[136]\ngave His life to redeem us, wore a crown of thorns. This was the way\nour Master\u2019s sacred head was decorated. He was \u201ca man of sorrows,\nand acquainted with grief.\u201d \u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions,\nHe was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was\nupon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\u201d Yet the very ones\nthat profess to be washed by the blood of Jesus, spilled for them,\ncan dress up and decorate their poor, mortal bodies, and dare profess\nto be followers of the holy, self-denying, humble Pattern. Oh, that\nall could see this as God sees it and showed it to me! It seemed too\nmuch for me to bear, to feel the anguish of soul that I felt as I beheld\nit. Said the angel: \u201cGod\u2019s people are peculiar; such He is purifying\nunto Himself.\u201d I saw that the outside appearance is an index to the\nheart. When the exterior is hung with ribbons, collars, and needless\nthings, it plainly shows that the love for all this is in the heart; unless\nsuch persons are cleansed from their corruption, they can never see\nGod, for only the pure in heart will see Him.\nI saw that the ax must be laid at the root of the tree. Such pride\nshould not be suffered in the church. It is these things that separate\nGod from His people, that shut the ark away from them. Israel have\nbeen asleep to the pride, and fashion, and conformity to the world,\nin the very midst of them. They advance every month in pride,\ncovetousness, selfishness, and love of the world. When their hearts\nare affected by the truth, it will cause a death to the world, and they\nwill lay aside the ribbons, laces, and collars; and, if they are dead,\nthe laugh, the jeer, and scorn of unbelievers will not move them.\nThey will feel an anxious desire to be separate from the world, like[137]\ntheir Master. They will not imitate its pride, fashions, or customs.\nThe noble object will be ever before them, to glorify God and gain\nthe immortal inheritance. This prospect will swallow up all beside of\nan earthly nature. God will have a people separate and distinct from\nthe world. And as soon as any have a desire to imitate the fashions\nof the world, that they do not immediately subdue, just so soon God\nceases to acknowledge them as His children. They are the children\nConformity to the World 131\nof the world and of darkness. They lust for the leeks and onions of\nEgypt, that is, desire to be as much like the world as possible; by so\ndoing, those that profess to have put on Christ virtually put Him off,\nand show that they are strangers to grace and strangers to the meek\nand lowly Jesus. If they had acquainted themselves with Him, they\nwould walk worthy of Him.\n* * * * *\nChapter 24\u2014Wives of Ministers\nI saw the wives of the ministers. Some of them are no help to\ntheir husbands, yet they profess the third angel\u2019s message. They\nthink more of studying their own wishes and pleasure than the will\nof God, or how they can hold up the hands of their husbands by their\nfaithful prayers and careful walk. I saw that some of them take so\nwillful and selfish a course that Satan makes them his instruments\nand works through them to destroy the influence and usefulness of\ntheir husbands. They feel at liberty to complain and murmur if they\nare brought through any strait places. They forget the sufferings of\nthe ancient Christians for the truth\u2019s sake and think that they must\nhave their wishes and way, and follow their own will. They forget\nthe suffering of Jesus, their Master. They forget the Man of Sorrows,\nwho was acquainted with grief\u2014He who had not where to lay His\nhead. They do not care to remember that holy brow, pierced with a[138]\ncrown of thorns. They forget Him, who, bearing His own cross to\nCalvary, fainted beneath its burden. Not merely the burden of the\nwooden cross, but the heavy burden of the sins of the world, was\nupon Him. They forget the cruel nails driven through His tender\nhands and feet, and His expiring, agonizing cries: \u201cMy God, My\nGod, why hast Thou forsaken Me?\u201d After all this suffering endured\nfor them, they feel a strong unwillingness to suffer for Christ\u2019s sake.\nThese persons, I saw, are deceiving themselves. They have no\npart nor lot in the matter. They have hold of the truth; but the truth\nhas not hold of them. When the truth, the solemn, important truth,\ngets hold of them, self will die; then the language will not be, \u201cI\nwill go there, I will not stay here;\u201d but the earnest inquiry will be,\n\u201cWhere does God want me to be? Where can I best glorify Him,\nand where can our united labors do the most good?\u201d Their will\nshould be swallowed up in the will of God. The willfulness and\nlack of consecration that some of the ministers\u2019 wives manifest will\nstand in the way of sinners; the blood of souls will be upon their\ngarments. Some of the ministers have borne a strong testimony in\n132\nWives of Ministers 133\nregard to the duty and the wrongs of the church; but it has not had\nits designed effect, for their own companions needed all the straight\ntestimony that had been borne, and the reproof came back upon\nthemselves with great weight. They let their companions affect them\nand drag them down, prejudicing their minds, and their usefulness\nand influence are lost; they feel desponding and disheartened, and\nrealize not the true source of the injury. It is close at home.\nThese sisters are closely connected with the work of God if He\nhas called their husbands to preach the present truth. These servants,\nif truly called of God, will feel the importance of the truth. They\nare standing between the living and the dead, and must watch for\nsouls as they that must give an account. Solemn is their calling, and [139]\ntheir companions can be a great blessing or a great curse to them.\nThey can cheer them when desponding, comfort them when cast\ndown, and encourage them to look up and trust fully in God when\ntheir faith fails. Or they can take an opposite course, look upon the\ndark side, think they have a hard time, exercise no faith in God, talk\ntheir trials and unbelief to their companions, indulge a complaining,\nmurmuring spirit, and be a dead weight and even a curse to them.\nI saw that the wives of the ministers should help their husbands\nin their labors and be exact and careful what influence they exert,\nfor they are watched, and more is expected of them than of others.\nTheir dress should be an example. Their lives and conversation\nshould be an example, savoring of life rather than of death. I saw\nthat they should take a humble, meek, yet exalted stand, not having\ntheir conversation upon things that do not tend to direct the mind\nheavenward. The great inquiry should be: \u201cHow can I save my own\nsoul, and be the means of saving others?\u201d I saw that no half-hearted\nwork in this matter is accepted of God. He wants the whole heart\nand interest, or He will have none. Their influence tells, decidedly,\nunmistakably, in favor of the truth or against it. They gather with\nJesus, or scatter abroad. An unsanctified wife is the greatest curse\nthat a minister can have. Those servants of God that have been and\nare still so unhappily situated as to have this withering influence at\nhome, should double their prayers and their watchfulness, take a\nfirm, decided stand, and let not this darkness press them down. They\nshould cleave closer to God, be firm and decided, rule well their own\nhouse, and live so that they can have the approbation of God and\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe watchcare of the angels. But if they yield to the wishes of their\nunconsecrated companions, the frown of God is brought upon the\ndwelling. The ark of God cannot abide in the house, because they\ncountenance and uphold them in their wrongs.\nOur God is a jealous God. It is a fearful thing to trifle with[140]\nHim. Anciently, Achan coveted a golden wedge and a Babylonish\ngarment, and secreted them, and all Israel suffered; they were driven\nbefore their enemies. And when Joshua inquired the cause, the Lord\nsaid: \u201cUp, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against\ntomorrow: for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed\nthing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine\nenemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.\u201d\nAchan had sinned, and God destroyed him and all his household,\nwith all they possessed, and wiped the curse from Israel.\nI saw that the Israel of God must arise and renew their strength\nin God by renewing and keeping their covenant with Him. Cov-\netousness, selfishness, love of money, and love of the world, are all\nthrough the ranks of Sabbathkeepers. These evils are destroying\nthe spirit of sacrifice among God\u2019s people. Those that have this\ncovetousness in their hearts are not aware of it. It has gained upon\nthem imperceptibly, and unless it is rooted out, their destruction\nwill be as sure as was Achan\u2019s. Many have taken the sacrifice from\nGod\u2019s altar. They love the world, love its gain and increase, and,\nunless there is an entire change in them, they will perish with the\nworld. God has lent them means; it is not their own, but God has\nmade them His stewards. And because of this, they call it their own\nand hoard it up. But, oh, how quick, when the prospering hand of\nGod is removed from them, it is all snatched away in a moment!\nThere must be a sacrificing for God, a denying of self for the truth\u2019s\nsake. Oh, how weak and frail is man! How puny his arm! I saw that\nsoon the loftiness of man is to be brought down, and the pride of\nman humbled. Kings and nobles, rich and poor, alike shall bow, and\nthe withering plagues of God shall fall upon them.\nNumber Three\u2014Testimony for the Church [141]\nChapter 25\u2014Be Zealous and Repent\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nThe Lord has shown me in vision some things concerning the\nchurch in its present lukewarm state, which I will relate to you. The\nchurch was presented before me in vision. Said the angel to the\nchurch: \u201cJesus speaks to thee, \u2018Be zealous and repent.\u2019\u201d This work, I\nsaw, should be taken hold of in earnest. There is something to repent\nof. Worldly-mindedness, selfishness, and covetousness have been\neating out the spirituality and life of God\u2019s people.\nThe danger of God\u2019s people for a few years past has been the\nlove of the world. Out of this have sprung the sins of selfishness\nand covetousness. The more they get of this world, the more they\nset their affections on it; and still they reach out for more. Said the\nangel: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye, than for\na rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d Yet many who profess\nto believe that we are having the last note of warning to the world,\nare striving with all their energies to place themselves in a position\nwhere it is easier for a camel to go through a needle\u2019s eye than for\nthem to enter the kingdom.\nThese earthly treasures are blessings when rightly used. Those\nwho have them should realize that they are lent them of God and\nshould cheerfully spend their means to advance His cause. They\nwill not lose their reward here. They will be kindly regarded by the[142]\nangels of God and will also lay up a treasure in heaven.\nI saw that Satan watches the peculiar, selfish, covetous temper-\nament of some who profess the truth, and he will tempt them by\nthrowing prosperity in their path, offering them the riches of earth.\nHe knows that if they do not overcome their natural temperament,\nthey will stumble and fall by loving mammon, worshiping their idol.\nSatan\u2019s object is often accomplished. The strong love of the world\novercomes, or swallows up, the love of the truth. The kingdoms of\nthe world are offered them, and they eagerly grasp their treasure and\nthink they are wonderfully prospered. Satan triumphs because his\n136\nBe Zealous and Repent 137\nplan has succeeded. They have given up the love of God for the love\nof the world.\nI saw that those who are thus prospered can thwart the design\nof Satan if they will overcome their selfish covetousness by laying\nall their possessions upon the altar of God. And when they see\nwhere means are needed to advance the cause of truth and to help\nthe widow, the fatherless, and afflicted, they should give cheerfully\nand thus lay up treasure in heaven.\nHeed the counsel of the True Witness. Buy gold tried in the\nfire, that thou mayest be rich, white raiment that thou mayest be\nclothed, and eyesalve that thou mayest see. Make some effort. These\nprecious treasures will not drop upon us without some exertion on\nour part. We must buy\u2014\u201cbe zealous and repent\u201d of our lukewarm\nstate. We must be awake to see our wrongs, to search for our sins,\nand to zealously repent of them.\nI saw that the brethren who have possessions have a work to\ndo to tear away from these earthly treasures and to overcome their\nlove of the world. Many of them love this world, love their treasure,\nbut are not willing to see it. They must be zealous and repent of\ntheir selfish covetousness, that the love of the truth may swallow up\neverything else. I saw that many of those who have riches will fail [143]\nto buy the gold, white raiment, and eyesalve. Their zeal does not\npossess intensity and earnestness proportionate to the value of the\nobject of which they are in pursuit.\nI saw these men while striving for the possessions of earth; what\nzeal they manifested, what earnestness, what energy to obtain an\nearthly treasure that must soon pass away! What cool calculations\nthey made! They plan and toil early and late, and sacrifice their ease\nand comfort for earthly treasure. A corresponding zeal on their part\nto obtain the gold, white raiment, and eyesalve will bring them in\npossession of these desirable treasures and life, everlasting life, in\nthe kingdom of God. I saw that if any need eyesalve, it is those who\nhave earthly possessions. Many of them are blind to their own state,\nblind to their firm grasp upon this world. Oh, that they may see!\n\u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My\nvoice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with\nhim, and he with Me.\u201d I saw that many have so much rubbish piled\nup at the door of their heart that they cannot get the door open. Some\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhave difficulties between themselves and their brethren to remove.\nOthers have evil tempers, selfish covetousness, to remove before\nthey can open the door. Others have rolled the world before the door\nof their heart, which bars the door. All this rubbish must be taken\naway, and then they can open the door and welcome the Saviour in.\nOh, how precious was this promise, as it was shown to me in\nvision! \u201cI will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he\nwith Me.\u201d Oh, the love, the wondrous love of God! After all our\nlukewarmness and sins He says: \u201cReturn unto Me, and I will return\nunto thee, and will heal all thy backslidings.\u201d This was repeated by\nthe angel a number of times. \u201cReturn unto Me, and I will return unto\nthee, and will heal all thy backslidings.\u201d\nSome, I saw, would gladly return. Others will not let this message[144]\nto the Laodicean church have its weight upon them. They will glide\nalong, much after the same manner as before, and will be spewed\nout of the mouth of the Lord. Those only who zealously repent will\nhave favor with God.\n\u201cTo him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne,\neven as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His\nthrone.\u201d We can overcome. Yes; fully, entirely. Jesus died to make\na way of escape for us, that we might overcome every evil temper,\nevery sin, every temptation, and sit down at last with Him.\nIt is our privilege to have faith and salvation. The power of\nGod has not decreased. His power, I saw, would be just as freely\nbestowed now as formerly. It is the church of God that have lost\ntheir faith to claim, their energy to wrestle, as did Jacob, crying: \u201cI\nwill not let Thee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d Enduring faith has been\ndying away. It must be revived in the hearts of God\u2019s people. There\nmust be a claiming of the blessing of God. Faith, living faith, always\nbears upward to God and glory; unbelief, downward to darkness and\ndeath.\nI saw that the minds of some of the church have not run in the\nright channel. There have been some peculiar temperaments that\nhave had their notions by which to measure their brethren. And if\nany did not exactly agree with them, there was trouble in the camp\nat once. Some have strained at a gnat and swallowed a camel.\nThese set notions have been humored and indulged altogether\ntoo long. There has been a picking at straws. And when there were\nBe Zealous and Repent 139\nno real difficulties in the church, trials have been manufactured. The\nminds of the church and the servants of the Lord are called from\nGod, truth, and heaven to dwell upon darkness. Satan delights to\nhave such things go on; it feasts him. But these are none of the trials\nwhich are to purify the church and that will in the end increase the [145]\nstrength of God\u2019s people.\nI saw that some are withering spiritually. They have lived some\ntime watching to keep their brethren straight\u2014watching for every\nfault to make trouble with them. And while doing this, their minds\nare not on God, nor on heaven, nor on the truth; but just where\nSatan wants them\u2014on someone else. Their souls are neglected; they\nseldom see or feel their own faults, for they have had enough to do\nto watch the faults of others without so much as looking to their own\nsouls or searching their own hearts. A person\u2019s dress, bonnet, or\napron takes their attention. They must talk to this one or that one,\nand it is sufficient to dwell upon for weeks. I saw that all the religion\na few poor souls have consists in watching the garments and acts of\nothers, and finding fault with them. Unless they reform, there will\nbe no place in heaven for them, for they would find fault with the\nLord Himself.\nSaid the angel: \u201cIt is an individual work to be right with God.\u201d\nThe work is between God and our own souls. But when persons\nhave so much care of others\u2019 faults, they take no care of themselves.\nThese notional, faultfinding ones would often cure themselves of the\nhabit if they would go directly to the individual they think is wrong.\nIt would be so crossing that they would give up their notions rather\nthan go. But it is easy to let the tongue run freely about this one or\nthat one when the accused is not present.\nSome think it is wrong to try to observe order in the worship of\nGod. But I have seen that it is not dangerous to observe order in the\nchurch of God. I have seen that confusion is displeasing to the Lord,\nand that there should be order in praying and also in singing. We\nshould not come to the house of God to pray for our families unless\ndeep feeling shall lead us while the Spirit of God is convicting them.\nGenerally, the proper place to pray for our families is at the family [146]\naltar. When the subjects of our prayers are at a distance, the closet is\nthe proper place to plead with God for them. When in the house of\nGod, we should pray for a present blessing and should expect God\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto hear and answer our prayers. Such meetings will be lively and\ninteresting.\nI saw that all should sing with the spirit and with the understand-\ning also. God is not pleased with jargon and discord. Right is always\nmore pleasing to Him than wrong. And the nearer the people of\nGod can approach to correct, harmonious singing, the more is He\nglorified, the church benefited, and unbelievers favorably affected.\nI have been shown the order, the perfect order, of heaven, and\nhave been enraptured as I listened to the perfect music there. After\ncoming out of vision, the singing here has sounded very harsh and\ndiscordant. I have seen companies of angels, who stood in a hollow\nsquare, everyone having a harp of gold. At the end of the harp was\nan instrument to turn to set the harp or change the tunes. Their\nfingers did not sweep over the strings carelessly, but they touched\ndifferent strings to produce different sounds. There is one angel who\nalways leads, who first touches the harp and strikes the note, then\nall join in the rich, perfect music of heaven. It cannot be described.\nIt is melody, heavenly, divine, while from every countenance beams\nthe image of Jesus, shining with glory unspeakable.\n* * * * *\nChapter 26\u2014The East and the West\nDear Brethren,\nThe Lord has shown me in vision some things in regard to the\nEast and the West which I feel it my duty to set before you. I saw that\nGod has been opening the way for the spread of present truth in the\nWest. It requires much more power to move the people in the East\nthan in the West, and at present but very little can be accomplished [147]\nin the East. Special efforts should be made at the present time where\nmost good will result.\nThe people in the East have heard the proclamation of the second\ncoming of Christ, and have seen much of the display of the power\nof God, and have fallen back into a state of indifference and security\nwhere it is almost impossible to reach them at present. After uncom-\nmon efforts are made in the East, with the best gifts, but very little\nis accomplished.\nI saw that the people in the West could be moved much more\neasily than those in the East. They have not had the light of the\ntruth, and have not rejected it, and their hearts are more tender and\nsusceptible to the truth and the Spirit of God. The hearts of many\nin the West are already prepared to eagerly receive the truth; and\nas the servants of God go out to labor for the salvation of precious\nsouls, they have much to encourage them in their arduous work. As\nthe people are anxious to hear, and many embrace the truth, the gift\nwhich God has given His servants is called out and strengthened.\nThey see that their efforts are crowned with success.\nI saw that tenfold more has been accomplished in the West than\nin the East with the same effort, and that the way is opening for\nstill greater success. I have seen that much can be done at present\nin Wisconsin, and still more in Illinois, and that efforts to spread\nthe truth must be made in Minnesota and Iowa. It will take effect\nin many hearts there. There was a large, very large, field of labor\nspread out before me in vision, which has not yet been entered; but\n141\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthere is not self-sacrificing help enough to fill half the places where\nthe people are all ready to hear the truth, and many to receive it.\nNew fields of labor, entirely new, must be visited; many will\nhave to go a warfare at their own charges, enter such fields with\nthe expectation of bearing their own expenses. Here, I saw, is a\ngood opportunity for the stewards of the Lord to act their part and\nsupport those who carry the truth to these places. It should be a great[148]\nprivilege for these stewards to render to God that which belongs to\nHim. By so doing they will discharge a Scriptural duty and free\nthemselves of a portion of their earthly treasure, which is now a\nburden to many who have an abundance. It will also add to their\ntreasure in heaven.\nI saw that the Eastern tent should not be carried over and over the\nsame ground. If need be, those who accompany the tent should go a\nwarfare at their own charges; they should pitch the tent where the\ntruth has not been presented, and the tent when thus pitched should\nbe well supplied with laborers.\nI saw that there had been a failure in going over the same old\nground, year after year, with almost exactly the same gifts. If possi-\nble, the most acceptable gifts should be obtained. It would be better,\nand accomplish more good, if there were fewer tent meetings, and a\nstronger force, or company, with different gifts to labor. Then there\nshould be a longer tarry in a place where an interest is awakened.\nThere has been too much haste in taking down the tent. Some begin\nto be favorably impressed, and there is need that persevering efforts\nbe put forth till their minds become settled and they commit them-\nselves on the truth. In many places where the tent has been pitched,\nthe ministers stay till the prejudice begins to wear away, and some\nwould then listen with minds free from prejudice; but just then the\ntent is taken down and sent on its way to another place. The rounds\nare gone over, time and means spent, and the servants of God can\nsee but very little accomplished through the tent season. But few\nare brought to acknowledge the truth, and God\u2019s servants, having\nseen but very little to cheer and encourage them, and call out the\ngift within them, lose instead of gaining in strength, spirituality, and\npower.\nI saw that special efforts should be made in the West with tents;\nfor the angels of God are preparing minds there to receive the truth.[149]\nEast and the West 143\nThis is why God has moved on some in the East to move to the West.\nTheir gifts can accomplish more in the West than in the East. The\nburden of the work is in the West, and it is of the greatest importance\nthat the servants of God should move in His opening providence.\nI saw that when the message shall increase greatly in power, then\nthe providence of God will open and prepare the way in the East for\nmuch more to be accomplished than can be at the present time. God\nwill then send some of His servants in power to visit places where\nlittle or nothing can now be done, and some who are now indifferent\nwill be aroused and will take hold of the truth. [The remainder of this\narticle is from a vision given at Round Grove, Illinois, December 9,\n1856.]\nI saw that God has warned those who have moved from the East\nto the West. He has shown them their duty, that it must not be their\nobject to get rich, but to do good to souls, to live out their faith, and\ntell those around them that this world is not their home.\nThe warning was sufficient, if it had been heeded; but many\nfailed to consider what God had shown. They rushed on and on, and\nbecame drunk with the spirit of the world. \u201cLook back,\u201d said the\nangel, \u201cand weigh all that God has shown in regard to those moving\nfrom the East to the West.\u201d Have you obeyed it? I saw that you\nhad gone entirely contrary to God\u2019s teachings, purchased largely,\nand instead of your works saying to those around you that you are\nseeking a better country, they have plainly declared that your home\nand treasure were here. Your works have denied your faith.\nNor is this all. The love that should exist between brethren\nhas been lacking. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d has been manifest;\na selfish, covetous spirit has been in the hearts of the brethren.\nInstead of looking out for the interests of the brethren and caring\nfor them, there has been manifested in deal a close, selfish spirit\nthat God despises. Those who make so high a profession, and who [150]\nnumber themselves among the peculiar people of God, saying by\ntheir profession that they are zealous of good works, should be\nnoble and generous, and should ever manifest a disposition to favor\ntheir brethren instead of themselves, and should give their brethren\nthe best chance. Generosity begets generosity. Selfishness begets\nselfishness.\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI saw that through the past summer the prevailing spirit has been\nto grasp as much of this world as possible. The commandments of\nGod have not been kept. With the mind we serve the law of God;\nbut the minds of many have been serving the world. And while their\nminds were all occupied with things of earth and serving themselves,\nthey could not serve the law of God. The Sabbath has not been kept.\nBy some the work of six days has been carried into the seventh. One\nhour, and even more, has often been taken from the commencement\nand close of the Sabbath.\nSome of the Sabbathkeepers who say to the world that they are\nlooking for Jesus\u2019 coming, and that they believe we are having the\nlast message of mercy, give way to their natural feelings, and barter,\nand trade, and are a proverb among unbelievers for their keenness in\ntrade, for being sharp, and always getting the best end of a bargain.\nSuch would better lose a little and exert a better influence in the\nworld, and a happier influence among brethren, and show that this\nworld is not their God.\nI saw that brethren should feel interested for one another. Espe-\ncially should those who are blessed with health have a kind regard\nand care for those who have not good health. They should favor\nthem. They should remember the lesson taught by Jesus of the good\nSamaritan.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cLove one another, as I have loved you.\u201d How much?\nHis love cannot be told. He left the glory that He had with the Father\nbefore the world was. \u201cHe was wounded for our transgressions, He[151]\nwas bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was\nupon Him; and with His stripes we are healed.\u201d He patiently bore\nevery indignity and scorn. Behold His agony in the garden, when\nHe prayed that the cup might pass from Him! Behold His sufferings\non Calvary! All this for guilty, lost man. And Jesus says: \u201cLove\none another, as I have loved you.\u201d How much? Well enough to give\nyour life for a brother. But has it come to this, that self must be\ngratified, and the word of God neglected? The world is their God.\nThey serve it, they love it, and the love of God has departed. If ye\nlove the world, the love of the Father is not in you.\nThe word of God has been neglected. In that are the warnings to\nGod\u2019s people which point out their dangers. But they have had so\nmany cares and perplexities that they hardly allow themselves time\nEast and the West 145\nto pray. There has been a mere empty form without the power. Jesus\nprayed, and, oh, how earnest were His prayers! And yet He was the\nbeloved Son of God!\nIf Jesus manifested so much earnestness, so much energy and\nagony, how much more need for those whom He has called to be\nheirs of salvation, dependent upon God for all their strength, to have\ntheir whole souls stirred to wrestle with God and say: \u201cI will not\nlet Thee go, except Thou bless me.\u201d But I saw that hearts have been\novercharged with the cares of this life, and that God and His word\nhave been neglected.\nI saw that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a\nneedle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom. \u201cLay not up for\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt,\nand where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for yourselves\ntreasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and\nwhere thieves do not break through nor steal: for where your treasure\nis, there will your heart be also.\u201d\nI saw that when the truth is presented, it should be in the power [152]\nand Spirit. Bring the people to the point to decide. Show them the\nimportance of the truth\u2014it is life or death. With becoming zeal,\npull souls out of the fire. But, oh, the blighting influence that has\nbeen cast by men professing to be waiting for their Lord, and yet\npossessing large and attractive lands! The farms have preached\nlouder, yes, much louder, than words can, that this world is their\nhome. The evil day is put off. Peace and safety reign. Oh, the\nwithering, blighting influence! God hates such worldly-mindedness.\n\u201cCut loose, cut loose,\u201d were the words of the angel.\nI was shown that all should have an eye single to the glory of\nGod. Those who have possessions have been too willing to excuse\nthemselves on account of wife and children. But I saw that God\nwould not be trifled with. When He speaks, He must be obeyed. If\nwife or children stand in the way and hold back, they should say as\nJesus said to Peter: \u201cGet thee behind Me, Satan.\u201d Why tempt ye me\nto withhold from God what justly belongs to Him, and ruin my own\nsoul? Have an eye single to the glory of God.\nI saw that many would have to learn what it is to be a Christian\u2014\nthat it is not in name; but it is having the mind of Christ, submitting\nto the will of God in all things. Especially will the young who have\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nnever known what privations or hardships are, who have a set will,\nand do not bend that will to the glory of God, have a great work to\ndo. They go along very smoothly until their will is crossed, and then\nthey have no control over themselves. They have not the will of God\nbefore them. They do not study how they can best glorify God, or\nadvance His cause, or do good to others. But it is self, self, how\ncan it be gratified? Such religion is not worth a straw. Those who\npossess it will be weighed in the balance and found wanting.\nThe true Christian will love to wait and watch for the teachings\nof God and the leadings of His Spirit. But with many, religion is[153]\nmerely a form. Vital godliness is lacking. Many dare to say, I will\ndo this, or that, or I will not do this; and the fear of offending God\nis scarcely thought of. Those thus described, I saw, could not enter\nheaven as they are. They may flatter themselves that they will be\nsaved, but God has no pleasure in them. Their lives do not please\nHim. Their prayers are an offense to Him.\nChrist now calls them: \u201cBe zealous and repent.\u201d He kindly and\nfaithfully admonishes them to buy gold, white raiment, and eyesalve.\nThey can choose either to be zealous, and partake largely of salvation,\nor be spewed out of the mouth of the Lord as disgusting, and be\nthrust from Him. God will not bear always. He is of tender pity,\nyet His Spirit will be grieved away for the last time. Mercy\u2019s sweet\nvoice will be no more heard. Its last precious notes will have died\naway, and those described will be left to their own ways, to be filled\nwith their own doings.\nI saw that those who profess to be looking for the coming of the\nLord should not have a close, penurious spirit. Some of those who\nhave been called to talk the truth, and to watch for souls as they that\nmust give an account, have wasted much precious time for the sake\nof saving a little, when their time was worth a great deal more than\nthat which they gained. This displeases God. It is right that economy\nshould be used, but it has by some been stretched into meanness\nwith no other object than to add to their treasures, which will shortly\neat their flesh like fire, unless they as faithful stewards make a right\ndisposal of their Lord\u2019s goods.\nNumber Four\u2014Testimony for the Church [154]\nChapter 27\u2014Young Sabbathkeepers\nAugust 22, 1857, at the house of prayer in Monterey, Michigan,\nI was shown that many have not yet heard the voice of Jesus, and\nthe saving message has not taken hold of the soul and worked a\nreformation in the life. Many of the young have not the spirit of\nJesus. The love of God is not in their hearts, therefore all the natural\nbesetments hold the victory instead of the Spirit of God and salvation.\nThose who really possess the religion of Jesus will not be\nashamed nor afraid to bear the cross before those who have more\nexperience than they. They will, if they earnestly long to be right,\ndesire all the help they can get from older Christians. Gladly will\nthey be helped by them; hearts that are warmed by love to God will\nnot be hindered by trifles in the Christian course. They will talk out\nwhat the Spirit of God works in. They will sing it out, pray it out.\nIt is the lack of religion, lack of holy living, that makes the young\nbackward. Their life condemns them. They know they do not live as\nChristians should, therefore they have not confidence toward God,\nor before the church.\nWhy the young feel more liberty when the older ones are absent\nis: They are with those of their kind. Each thinks he is as good as\nthe other. All fail of the mark, but measure themselves by them-\nselves, and compare themselves among themselves, and neglect[155]\nthe only perfect and true standard. Jesus is the true Pattern. His\nself-sacrificing life is our example.\nI saw how little the Pattern was studied, how little exalted before\nthem. How little do the young suffer, or deny self, for their religion!\nTo sacrifice is scarcely thought of among them. They entirely fail of\nimitating the Pattern in this respect. I saw that the language of their\nlives is: Self must be gratified, pride must be indulged. They forget\nthe Man of Sorrows, who was acquainted with grief. The sufferings\nof Jesus in Gethsemane, His sweating as it were great drops of blood\nin the garden, the platted crown of thorns that pierced His holy brow,\ndo not move them. They have become benumbed. Their sensibilities\n148\nYoung Sabbathkeepers 149\nare blunted, and they have lost all sense of the great sacrifice made\nfor them. They can sit and listen to the story of the cross, hear how\nthe cruel nails were driven through the hands and feet of the Son of\nGod, and it does not stir the depths of the soul.\nSaid the angel: \u201cIf such should be ushered into the city of God,\nand told that all its rich beauty and glory was theirs to enjoy eternally,\nthey would have no sense of how dearly that inheritance was pur-\nchased for them. They would never realize the matchless depths of\na Saviour\u2019s love. They have not drunk of the cup, nor been baptized\nwith the baptism. Heaven would be marred if such should dwell\nthere. Those only who have partaken of the sufferings of the Son of\nGod, and have come up through great tribulation, and have washed\ntheir robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, can enjoy\nthe indescribable glory and unsurpassed beauty of heaven.\u201d\nThe want of this necessary preparation will shut out the greater\nportion of young professors, for they will not labor earnestly and\nzealously enough to obtain that rest that remains for the people of\nGod. They will not honestly confess their sins, that they may be [156]\npardoned and blotted out. These sins in a short time will be revealed\nin just their enormity. God\u2019s eye does not slumber. He knows every\nsin that is hidden from mortal eye. The guilty know just what sins\nto confess that their souls may be clean before God. Jesus is now\ngiving them opportunity to confess, to repent in deep humility, and\npurify their lives by obeying and living out the truth. Now is the\ntime for wrongs to be righted and sins to be confessed, or they will\nappear before the sinner in the day of God\u2019s wrath.\nParents generally put too much confidence in their children; for\noften when the parents are confiding in them, they are in concealed\niniquity. Parents, watch your children with a jealous care. Exhort,\nreprove, counsel them when you rise up and when you sit down,\nwhen you go out and when you come in, line upon line, precept\nupon precept, here a little, and there a little. Subdue your children\nwhen they are young. With many parents this is sadly neglected.\nThey do not take as firm and decided a stand as they should in regard\nto their children. They suffer them to be like the world, to love dress,\nand associate with those who hate the truth and whose influence is\npoisonous. By so doing they encourage in their children a worldly\ndisposition.\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI saw that there should always be a fixed principle with Christian\nparents to be united in the government of their children. There is a\nfault in this respect with some parents\u2014a lack of union. The fault\nis sometimes with the father, but oftener with the mother. The fond\nmother pets and indulges her children. The father\u2019s labor calls him\nfrom home often, and from the society of his children. The mother\u2019s\ninfluence tells. Her example does much toward forming the character\nof the children.\nSome fond mothers suffer wrongs in their children which should\nnot be allowed in them for a moment. The wrongs of the children\nare sometimes concealed from the father. Articles of dress or some [157]\nother indulgence is granted by the mother with the understanding\nthat the father is to know nothing about it, for he would reprove for\nthese things.\nHere a lesson of deception is effectually taught the children.\nThen if the father discovers these wrongs, excuses are made and\nbut half the truth told. The mother is not openhearted. She does\nnot consider as she should that the father has the same interest in\nthe children as herself, and that he should not be kept ignorant of\nthe wrongs or besetments that ought to be corrected in them while\nyoung. Things have been covered. The children know the lack of\nunion in their parents, and it has its effect. The children begin young\nto deceive, cover up, tell things in a different light from what they\nare to their mother, as well as their father. Exaggeration becomes\nhabit, and blunt falsehoods come to be told with but little conviction\nor reproof of conscience.\nThese wrongs commenced by the mother\u2019s concealing things\nfrom the father, who has an equal interest with her in the character\ntheir children are forming. The father should have been consulted\nfreely. All should have been laid open to him. But the opposite\ncourse, taken to conceal the wrongs of the children, encourages in\nthem a disposition to deceive, a lack of truthfulness and honesty.\nThe only hope of these children, whether they profess religion\nor not, is to be thoroughly converted. Their whole character must\nbe changed. Thoughtless mother, do you know, as you teach your\nchildren, that their whole religious experience is affected by their\nteaching when young? Subdue them young; teach them to submit\nto you, and the more readily will they learn to yield obedience to\nYoung Sabbathkeepers 151\nthe requirements of God. Encourage in them a truthful, honest\ndisposition. Let them never have occasion to doubt your sincerity\nand exact truthfulness.\nI saw that the young profess, but do not enjoy, the saving power\nof God. They lack religion, lack salvation. And, oh, the idle, un- [158]\nprofitable words they speak! There is a faithful, fearful record kept\nof them, and mortals will be judged according to the deeds done in\nthe body. Young friends, your deeds and your idle words are written\nin the book. Your conversation has not been on eternal things, but\nupon this, that, and the other\u2014common, worldly conversation that\nChristians should not engage in. It is all written in the book.\nI saw that unless there is an entire change in the young, a thor-\nough conversion, they may despair of heaven. From what has been\nshown me, there are not more than half of the young who profess\nreligion and the truth who have been truly converted. If they had\nbeen converted they would bear fruit to the glory of God. Many\nare leaning upon a supposed hope without a true foundation. The\nfountain is not cleansed, therefore the streams proceeding from that\nfountain are not pure. Cleanse the fountain, and the streams will be\npure. If the heart is right, your words, your dress, your acts, will all\nbe right. True godliness is lacking. I would not dishonor my Master\nso much as to admit that a careless, trifling, prayerless person is a\nChristian. No; a Christian has victory over his besetments, over his\npassions. There is a remedy for the sin-sick soul. That remedy is in\nJesus. Precious Saviour! His grace is sufficient for the weakest; and\nthe strongest must also have His grace or perish.\nI saw how this grace could be obtained. Go to your closet, and\nthere alone plead with God: \u201cCreate in me a clean heart, O God; and\nrenew a right spirit within me.\u201d Be in earnest, be sincere. Fervent\nprayer availeth much. Jacoblike, wrestle in prayer. Agonize. Jesus,\nin the garden, sweat great drops of blood; you must make an effort.\nDo not leave your closet until you feel strong in God; then watch,\nand just as long as you watch and pray you can keep these evil\nbesetments under, and the grace of God can and will appear in you.\nGod forbid that I should cease to warn you. Young friends, [159]\nseek the Lord with all your heart. Come with zeal, and when you\nsincerely feel that without the help of God you perish, when you\npant after Him as the hart panteth after the water brooks, then will\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe Lord strengthen you speedily. Then will your peace pass all\nunderstanding. If you expect salvation, you must pray. Take time.\nBe not hurried and careless in your prayers. Beg of God to work in\nyou a thorough reformation, that the fruits of His Spirit may dwell\nin you, and you shine as lights in the world. Be not a hindrance or\ncurse to the cause of God; you can be a help, a blessing. Does Satan\ntell you that you cannot enjoy salvation, full and free? Believe him\nnot.\nI saw that it is the privilege of every Christian to enjoy the deep\nmovings of the Spirit of God. A sweet, heavenly peace will pervade\nthe mind, and you will love to meditate upon God and heaven. You\nwill feast upon the glorious promises of His word. But know first\nthat you have begun the Christian course. Know that the first steps\nare taken in the road to everlasting life. Be not deceived. I fear,\nyea, I know, that many of you know not what religion is. You have\nfelt some excitement, some emotion, but have never seen sin in its\nenormity. You have never felt your undone condition and turned\nfrom your evil ways with bitter sorrow. You have never died to the\nworld. You still love its pleasures; you love to engage in conversation\non worldly matters. But when the truth of God is introduced, you\nhave nothing to say. Why so silent? Why so talkative upon worldly\nthings, and so silent upon the subject that should most concern you\u2014\na subject that should engage your whole soul? The truth of God does\nnot dwell in you.\nI saw that many are fair in their profession, while within is\ncorruption. Deceive not yourselves, falsehearted professors. God\nlooks at the heart. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart the mouth\nspeaketh.\u201d The world, I saw, is in the heart of such, but the religion[160]\nof Jesus is not there. If professed Christians love Jesus better than\nthe world, they will love to speak of Him, their best Friend, in whom\ntheir highest affections are centered. He came to their aid when they\nfelt their lost and perishing condition. When weary and heavy-laden\nwith sin, they turned unto Him. He removed their burden of guilt\nand sin, took away their sorrow and mourning, and turned the whole\ncurrent of their affections. The things they once loved, they now\nhate; and the things they hated, they now love.\nHas this great change taken place in you? Be not deceived. I\nwould never name the name of Christ, or I would give Him my whole\nYoung Sabbathkeepers 153\nheart, my undivided affections. We should feel the deepest gratitude\nthat Jesus will accept this offering. He demands all. When we are\nbrought to yield to His claims, and give up all, then, and not till then,\nwill He throw around us His arms of mercy. But what do we give\nwhen we give all? A sin-polluted soul for Jesus to purify, to cleanse\nby His mercy, and to save from death by His matchless love. And\nyet I saw that some thought it hard to give up all. I am ashamed to\nhear it spoken of, ashamed to write it.\nDo you talk about self-denial? What did Christ give for us?\nWhen you think it hard that Christ requires all, go to Calvary, and\nweep there over such a thought. Behold the hands and feet of your\nDeliverer torn by the cruel nails that you may be washed from sin\nby His own blood!\nThose who feel the constraining love of God do not ask how little\nmay be given in order to obtain the heavenly reward; they ask not\nfor the lowest standard, but aim at a perfect conformity to the will of\ntheir Redeemer. With ardent desire they yield all, and manifest zeal\nproportionate to the value of the object of which they are in pursuit.\nWhat is the object? Immortality, eternal life.\nYoung friends, many of you are sadly deceived. You have been [161]\nsatisfied with something short of pure and undefiled religion. I want\nto arouse you. The angels of God are trying to arouse you. Oh, that\nthe important truths of the word of God may arouse you to a sense of\nyour danger, and lead you to a thorough examination of yourselves!\nYour hearts are yet carnal. They are not subject to the law of God,\nneither indeed can be. These carnal hearts must be changed, and\nyou see such beauty in holiness that you will pant after it as the\nhart panteth after the water brooks. Then you will love God and\nlove His law. Then the yoke of Christ will be easy and His burden\nlight. Although you will have trials, yet these trials, well borne, only\nmake the way more precious. The immortal inheritance is for the\nself-denying Christian.\nI saw that the Christian should not set too high a value, or depend\ntoo much, upon a happy flight of feeling. These feelings are not\nalways true guides. It should be the study of every Christian to serve\nGod from principle, and not be ruled by feeling. By so doing, faith\nwill be brought into exercise, and will increase. I was shown that if\nthe Christian lives a humble, self-sacrificing life, peace and joy in the\n154 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nLord will be the result. But the greatest happiness experienced will\nbe in doing others good, in making others happy. Such happiness\nwill be lasting.\nMany of the young have not a fixed principle to serve God. They\ndo not exercise faith. They sink under every cloud. They have no\npower of endurance. They do not grow in grace. They appear to\nkeep the commandments of God. They make now and then a formal\nprayer and are called Christians. Their parents are so anxious for\nthem that they accept anything which appears favorable, and do not\nlabor with them, and teach them that the carnal mind must die. They\nencourage them to come along and act a part; but they fail to lead\nthem to search their own hearts diligently, to examine themselves,\nand to count the cost of what it is to be a Christian. The result is,[162]\nthe young profess to be Christians without sufficiently trying their\nmotives.\nSays the True Witness: \u201cI would thou wert cold or hot. So then\nbecause thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee\nout of My mouth.\u201d Satan is willing that you should be Christians in\nname, for you can suit his purpose better. If you have a form and\nnot true godliness, he can use you to decoy others into the same\nself-deceived way. Some poor souls will look to you, instead of\nlooking to the Bible standard, and will come up no higher. They are\nas good as you, and are satisfied.\nThe young are often urged to do duty, to speak or pray in meeting;\nurged to die to pride. Every step they are urged. Such religion is\nworth nothing. Let the carnal heart be changed, and it will not be\nsuch drudgery, ye coldhearted professors, to serve God. All that love\nof dress and pride of appearance will be gone. The time that you\nspend standing before the glass preparing the hair to please the eye,\nshould be devoted to prayer and searching of heart. There will be no\nplace for outward adornment in the sanctified heart; but there will be\nan earnest, anxious seeking for the inward adorning, the Christian\ngraces\u2014the fruits of the Spirit of God.\nSays the apostle: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward\nadorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on\nof apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is\nnot corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which\nis in the sight of God of great price.\u201d\nYoung Sabbathkeepers 155\nSubdue the carnal mind, reform the life, and the poor mortal\nframe will not be so idolized. If the heart is reformed, it will be\nseen in the outward appearance. If Christ be in us the hope of glory,\nwe shall discover such matchless charms in Him that the soul will\nbe enamored. It will cleave to Him, choose to love Him, and in\nadmiration of Him, self will be forgotten. Jesus will be magnified [163]\nand adored, and self abased and humbled. But a profession, without\nthis deep love, is mere talk, dry formality, and heavy drudgery. Many\nof you may retain a notion of religion in the head, an outside religion,\nwhen the heart is not cleansed. God looks at the heart; \u201call things\nare naked and opened unto the eyes of Him with whom we have to\ndo.\u201d Will He be satisfied with anything but truth in the inward parts?\nEvery truly converted soul will carry the unmistakable marks that\nthe carnal mind is subdued.\nI speak plainly. I do not think this will discourage a true Chris-\ntian; and I do not want any of you to come up to the time of trouble\nwithout a well-grounded hope in your Redeemer. Determine to know\nthe worst of your case. Ascertain if you have an inheritance on high.\nDeal truly with your own soul. Remember that a church without\nspot, or wrinkle, or any such thing, will Jesus present to His Father.\nHow are you to know that you are accepted of God? Study His\nword prayerfully. Lay it not aside for any other book. This Book\nconvinces of sin. It plainly reveals the way of salvation. It brings\nto view a bright and glorious reward. It reveals to you a complete\nSaviour, and teaches you that through His boundless mercy alone\ncan you expect salvation.\nDo not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion. With\nearnest, fervent prayer, plead for purity of soul. Plead as earnestly, as\neagerly, as you would for your mortal life, were it at stake. Remain\nbefore God until unutterable longings are begotten within you for\nsalvation, and the sweet evidence is obtained of pardoned sin.\nThe hope of eternal life is not to be received upon slight grounds.\nIt is a subject to be settled between God and your own soul\u2014settled\nfor eternity. A supposed hope, and nothing more, will prove your\nruin. Since you are to stand or fall by the word of God, it is to that\nword you must look for testimony in your case. There you can see [164]\nwhat is required of you to become a Christian. Do not lay off your\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\narmor, or leave the battlefield until you have obtained the victory,\nand triumph in your Redeemer.\n* * * * *\nChapter 28\u2014Church Trials\nThe following view was given at Ulysses, Pennsylvania, July\n6, 1857. It relates to things as they have existed in ----- and other\nplaces in New York.\nThere have been so many church trials among the brethren in\nthe State of New York, that God has not had the least to do with,\nthat the church have lost their strength, and they know not how to\nregain it. Love for one another has disappeared, and a faultfinding,\naccusing spirit has prevailed. It has been considered a virtue to\nhunt up everything about one another that looked wrong, and make\nit appear fully as bad as it really was. The bowels of compassion\nthat yearn in love and pity toward brethren, have not existed. The\nreligion of some has consisted in faultfinding, picking at everything\nbearing the appearance of wrong, until the noble feelings of the soul\nare withered. The mind should be elevated to dwell upon eternal\nscenes, heaven, its treasures, its glories, and should take sweet and\nholy satisfaction in the truths of the Bible. It should love to feed\nupon the precious promises that God\u2019s word affords, draw comfort\nfrom them, and be lifted above trifles to weighty, eternal things.\nBut, oh, how differently has the mind been employed! Picking at\nstraws! Church meetings, as they have been held, have been a living\ncurse to many in New York. These manufactured trials have given\nfull liberty to evil surmising. Jealousy has been fed. Hatred has\nexisted, but they knew it not. A wrong idea has been in the minds of\nsome, to reprove without love, hold others to their idea of what is\nright, and spare not, but bear down with crushing weight.\nI saw that many in New York have had so much care for their [165]\nbrethren, to keep them straight, that they have neglected their own\nhearts. They are so fearful that their brethren will not be zealous and\nrepent, that they forget that they have wrongs that must be righted.\nWith their own hearts unsanctified, they try to right their brethren.\nNow the only way the brethren and sisters in New York can rise is\nfor each to attend to his own individual case, and set his own heart\n157\n158 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin order. If sin is plain in a brother, breathe it not to another, but\nwith love for the brother\u2019s soul, with a heart full of compassion, with\nbowels of mercy, tell him the wrong, then leave the matter with him\nand the Lord. You have discharged your duty. You are not to pass\nsentence.\nIt has been made too light an affair to rein up a brother, to\ncondemn him, and hold him under condemnation. There has been a\nzeal for God, but not according to knowledge. If each would set his\nown heart in order, when the brethren meet together their testimony\nwould be ready and come from a full soul, and the people around\nthat believe not the truth would be moved. The manifestation of the\nSpirit of God would tell to their hearts that you are the children of\nGod. Our love for one another should be visible to all. Then it will\ntell. It will have an influence.\nI saw that the church in New York might rise. Take hold of the\nwork individually, be zealous and repent; and after all known wrongs\nare righted, then believe that God accepts you. Go not mourning,\nbut take God at His word. Seek Him diligently, and believe that He\nreceives you. A part of the work is to believe. He is faithful who has\npromised. Climb up by faith.\nThe brethren can rise in New York as well as in other places;\nand they can drink of the salvation of God. They can move under-\nstandingly, and each have an experience for himself in this message\nof the True Witness to the Laodiceans. The church feel that they\nare down, but know not how to rise. The intentions of some may be[166]\nvery good; they may confess; yet I saw that they are watched with\nsuspicion, and are made offenders for a word, until they have no\nliberty, no salvation. They dare not act out the simple feelings of the\nheart, because they are watched. It is God\u2019s pleasure that His people\nshould fear Him, and have confidence before one another.\nI saw that many have taken advantage of what God has shown in\nregard to the sins and wrongs of others. They have taken the extreme\nmeaning of what has been shown in vision, and then have pressed\nit until it has had a tendency to weaken the faith of many in what\nGod has shown, and also to discourage and dishearten the church.\nWith tender compassion should brother deal with brother. Delicately\nshould he deal with feelings. It is the nicest and most important\nwork that ever yet was done to touch the wrongs of another. With\nChurch Trials 159\nthe deepest humility should a brother do this, considering his own\nweakness, lest he also should be tempted.\nI have seen the great sacrifice which Jesus made to redeem man.\nHe did not consider His own life too dear to sacrifice. Said Jesus:\n\u201cLove one another, as I have loved you.\u201d Do you feel, when a brother\nerrs, that you could give your life to save him? If you feel thus, you\ncan approach him and affect his heart; you are just the one to visit\nthat brother. But it is a lamentable fact that many who profess to be\nbrethren, are not willing to sacrifice any of their opinions or their\njudgment to save a brother. There is but little love for one another.\nA selfish spirit is manifested.\nDiscouragement has come upon the church. They have been\nloving the world, loving their farms, their cattle, etc. Now Jesus\ncalls them to cut loose, to lay up treasure in heaven, to buy gold,\nwhite raiment, and eyesalve. Precious treasures are these. They will\nobtain for the possessor an entrance into the kingdom of God.\nThe people of God must move understandingly. They should [167]\nnot be satisfied until every known sin is confessed; then it is their\nprivilege and duty to believe that Jesus accepts them. They must\nnot wait for others to press through the darkness and obtain the\nvictory for them to enjoy. Such enjoyment will last only till the\nmeeting closes. But God must be served from principle instead of\nfrom feeling. Morning and night obtain the victory for yourselves\nin your own family. Let not your daily labor keep you from this.\nTake time to pray, and as you pray, believe that God hears you. Have\nfaith mixed with your prayers. You may not at all times feel the\nimmediate answer; but then it is that faith is tried. You are proved to\nsee whether you will trust in God, whether you have living, abiding\nfaith. \u201cFaithful is He that calleth you, who also will do it.\u201d Walk the\nnarrow plank of faith. Trust all on the promises of the Lord. Trust\nGod in darkness. That is the time to have faith. But you often let\nfeeling govern you. You look for worthiness in yourselves when you\ndo not feel comforted by the Spirit of God, and despair because you\ncannot find it. You do not trust enough in Jesus, precious Jesus. You\ndo not make His worthiness to be all, all. The very best you can do\nwill not merit the favor of God. It is Jesus\u2019 worthiness that will save\nyou, His blood that will cleanse you. But you have efforts to make.\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nYou must do what you can on your part. Be zealous and repent, then\nbelieve.\nConfound not faith and feeling together. They are distinct. Faith\nis ours to exercise. This faith we must keep in exercise. Believe,\nbelieve. Let your faith take hold of the blessing, and it is yours. Your\nfeelings have nothing to do with this faith. When faith brings the\nblessing to your heart, and you rejoice in the blessing, it is no more\nfaith, but feeling.\nThe people of God in New York must steadily rise, and come\nout of darkness, and let their light shine. They are standing right in[168]\nthe way of the work of God. They must let the message of the third\nangel do its work upon their hearts. Brethren, God is dishonored by\nyour long, faithless prayers. Look away from the unworthiness of\nself, and exalt Jesus. Talk of faith, of light, and of heaven, and you\nwill have faith, light, and love, and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\n* * * * *\nChapter 29\u2014\u201cTake Heed\u201d\nThe following was addressed to two brethren at -----; but being\napplicable to many, it is here given for the benefit of the church:\nDear Brethren,\nIn the vision given at your place, I was shown something con-\ncerning you both. The angel pointed to you, and repeated these\nwords: \u201cTake heed to yourselves, lest at anytime your hearts be\novercharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,\nand so that day come upon you unawares.\u201d\nI saw that you both have a great conflict before you; you will\nhave a constant warfare to keep this world out of your hearts, for\nyou love it. The great study with you now must be how to love\nJesus and His service better than the world. If you love the world\nmost, your works will testify to the fact. If you love Jesus and His\nservice most, your works will testify to that fact also. I saw that the\ngaze of many in this world is upon you. Many would exult in your\ndownfall, others rejoice in your advancement. Satan and evil angels\nwill present to you the glory of the kingdoms of this world. If you\nwill worship him, or worship a worldly treasure, he will hold it up\nin every light to attract and lead you to love and worship.\nJesus and your guardian angels are pointing you above your\nfarms, your cattle, and your earthly treasure, to the kingdom of [169]\nheaven, to an immortal inheritance, an eternal substance in the\nkingdom of glory. Said the angel: \u201cYou must die to this world.\u201d\n\u201cLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any\nman love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d\nI saw that if, in the providence of God, wealth has been acquired,\nthere is no sin in possessing it; and if no opportunities present\nthemselves to use this means to advance the cause of God, there\nis no sin in still possessing it. But if opportunities are presented\nto the brethren to use their property to the glory of God and the\nadvancement of His cause, and they withhold it, it will be a cause\nof stumbling to them. In the day of trouble that which was their\n161\n162 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhoarded treasure will be an offense unto them. Then all opportunities\nwill be past for using their substance to the glory of God, and in\nanguish of spirit they will cast it from them to the moles and to the\nbats. Their gold and their silver cannot save them in that day. It falls\nupon them with crushing weight, that an account must be given of\ntheir stewardship, what use they have made of their Lord\u2019s money.\nSelf-love made them believe that it was all their own, and that they\nmight want it all; but they then feel, bitterly feel and understand,\nthat their means was only lent them of God, to be freely returned by\nbeing used to advance His cause. Their riches deceived them. They\nfelt poor and lived for themselves, and at last they will find that the\nportion they might have used for God\u2019s cause is a terrible burden.\nSaid the angel of God: \u201cLay all upon the altar, a living, consum-\ning sacrifice. Bind it with cords, if you cannot keep it there. Give\nyourselves to prayer. Live at the altar. Strengthen your purposes\nby the promises of God.\u201d \u201cSell that ye have, and give alms; provide\nyourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that\nfaileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\u201d\n\u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and\nrust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay[170]\nup for yourselves treasures in heaven.\u201d\nI saw that if God had given you wealth above the plainest and\npoorest, it should humble you, for it lays you under greater obliga-\ntions. Where much is given, even of a worldly substance, much will\nbe required. Upon this principle you are bound to possess noble,\ngenerous dispositions. Seek for opportunities to do good with what\nyou have. \u201cLay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.\u201d\nI saw that the least that has been required of Christians in past\ndays, is to possess a spirit of liberality, and to consecrate to the Lord\na portion of all their increase. Every true Christian has considered\nthis a privilege, but some who have borne the name only, have\nconsidered it a task; the grace and love of God had never wrought in\nthem the good work, or they would gladly have advanced the cause\nof their Redeemer. But Christians who are living in the last days,\nand who are waiting for their Lord, are required to do even more\nthan this. God requires them to sacrifice.\n\u201cTake Heed\u201d 163\nSaid the angel: \u201cJesus left a bright track for you to follow. Tread\nclosely in His footsteps. Share His life of self-denial, His self-\nsacrificing life, and inherit with Him the crown of glory.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 30\u2014The Rich Young Man\nAt Monterey, Michigan, October 8, 1857, I was shown in vision\nthat the condition of many Sabbathkeepers was like that of the young\nman who came to Jesus to know what he should do to inherit eternal\nlife.\n\u201cAnd, behold, one came and said unto Him, Good Master, what\ngood thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life? And He said unto\nhim, Why callest thou Me good? there is none good but One, that\nis, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.[171]\nHe saith unto Him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,\nThou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not\nbear false witness, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt\nlove thy neighbor as thyself. The young man saith unto Him, All\nthese things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet? Jesus\nsaid unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and\ngive to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come\nand follow Me. But when the young man heard that saying, he went\naway sorrowful: for he had great possessions.\n\u201cThen said Jesus unto His disciples, Verily I say unto you, That\na rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. And again\nI say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a\nneedle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When\nHis disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who\nthen can be saved? But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them,\nWith men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.\u201d\nMatthew 19:16-26.\nJesus quoted five of the last six commandments to the young\nman, also the second great commandment, on which the last six\ncommandments hang. Those mentioned he thought he had kept.\nJesus did not mention the first four commandments, containing our\nduty to God. In answer to the inquiry of the young man, \u201cWhat lack\nI yet?\u201d Jesus said unto him: \u201cIf thou wilt be perfect, go and sell\n164\nRich Young Man 165\nthat thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in\nheaven.\u201d\nHere was his lack. He failed to keep the first four command-\nments, also the last six. He failed to love his neighbor as himself.\nSaid Jesus: \u201cGive to the poor.\u201d Jesus touched his possessions. \u201cSell\nthat thou hast, and give to the poor.\u201d In this direct reference He\npointed out his idol. His love of riches was supreme; therefore it\nwas impossible for him to love God with all his heart, with all his\nsoul, with all his mind. And this supreme love for his riches shut his [172]\neyes to the wants of his fellow men. He did not love his neighbor\nas himself, therefore he failed to keep the last six commandments.\nHis heart was on his treasure. It was swallowed up in his earthly\npossessions. He loved his possessions better than God, better than\nthe heavenly treasure. He heard the conditions from the mouth of\nJesus. If he would sell and give to the poor, he should have treasure\nin heaven. Here was a test of how much higher he prized eternal life\nthan riches. Did he eagerly lay hold of the prospect of eternal life?\nDid he earnestly strive to remove the obstacle that was in his way of\nhaving a treasure in heaven? Oh, no; \u201che went away sorrowful: for\nhe had great possessions.\u201d\nI was pointed to these words: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\nkingdom of God.\u201d Said Jesus: \u201cWith men this is impossible; but\nwith God all things are possible.\u201d Said the angel: \u201cWill God permit\nthe rich men to keep their riches, and yet enter into the kingdom of\nGod?\u201d Another angel answered: \u201cNo, never.\u201d\nI saw that it is God\u2019s plan that these riches should be used prop-\nerly, distributed to bless the needy, and to advance the work of God.\nIf men love their riches better than they love their fellow men, better\nthan they love God or the truths of His word, if their hearts are on\ntheir riches, they cannot have eternal life. They would rather yield\nthe truth than sell and give to the poor. Here they are proved to see\nhow much they love God, how much they love the truth; and, like\nthe young man in the Bible, many go away sorrowful because they\ncannot have their riches and a treasure in heaven, too. They cannot\nhave both; and they venture to risk their chance of eternal life for a\nworldly possession.\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\n\u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than\nfor a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d With God all[173]\nthings are possible. Truth, set home to the heart by the Spirit of God,\nwill crowd out the love of riches. The love of Jesus and of riches\ncannot dwell in the same heart. The love of God so far surpasses\nthe love of riches that the possessor breaks away from his riches\nand transfers his affections to God. Through love he is then led\nto minister to the wants of God\u2019s cause. It is his highest pleasure\nto make a right disposition of his Lord\u2019s goods. Love to God and\nhis fellow men predominates, and he holds all that he has as not\nhis own, and faithfully discharges his duty as God\u2019s steward. Then\ncan he keep both the great commandments of the law: \u201cThou shalt\nlove the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and\nwith all thy mind.\u201d \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\u201d In this\nway it is possible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. \u201cAnd\neveryone that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father,\nor mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name\u2019s sake, shall\nreceive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life. But many\nthat are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.\u201d\nHere is the reward for those who sacrifice for God. They receive\na hundredfold in this life, and shall inherit everlasting life. \u201cBut\nmany that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.\u201d I was\nshown those who receive the truth, but do not live it. They cling to\ntheir possessions, and are not willing to distribute of their substance\nto advance the cause of God. They have not faith to venture and trust\nGod. Their love of this world swallows up their faith. God calls for\na portion of their substance, but they heed it not. They reason that\nthey have labored hard to obtain what they have, and they cannot\nlend it to the Lord, for they may come to want. \u201cO ye of little faith.\u201d\nThat God who cared for Elijah in the time of famine, will not pass\nby one of His self-sacrificing children. He who has numbered the\nhairs of their head, will care for them, and in days of famine they\nwill be satisfied. While the wicked are perishing all around them for[174]\nwant of bread, their bread and water will be sure. Those who still\ncling to their earthly treasure, and will not make a right disposition\nof that which is lent them of God, will lose their treasure in heaven,\nlose everlasting life.\nRich Young Man 167\nGod in His providence has moved upon the hearts of some of\nthose who have riches, and has converted them to the truth, that\nthey with their substance may assist to keep His work moving. And\nif those who are wealthy will not do this, if they do not fulfill the\npurpose of God, He will pass them by, and raise up others to fill\ntheir place who will fulfill His purpose, and with their possessions\ngladly distribute to meet the necessities of the cause of God. In this\nthey will be first. God will have those in His cause who will do this.\nHe could send means from heaven to carry on His work; but\nthis is out of His order. He has ordained that men should be His\ninstruments, that as a great sacrifice was made to redeem them, they\nshould act a part in this work of salvation, by making a sacrifice\nfor one another, and by thus doing show how highly they prize the\nsacrifice that has been made for them.\nI was directed to James 5:1-3: \u201cGo to now, ye rich men, weep\nand howl for your miseries that shall come upon you. Your riches\nare corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten. Your gold and\nsilver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against\nyou, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure\ntogether for the last days.\u201d\nI saw that these fearful words apply particularly to the wealthy\nwho profess to believe the present truth. The Lord calls them to use\ntheir means to advance His cause. Opportunities are presented to\nthem, but they shut their eyes to the wants of the cause, and cling\nfast to their earthly treasure. Their love for the world is greater than\ntheir love for the truth, their love for their fellow men, or their love\nfor God. He calls for their substance, but they selfishly, covetously, [175]\nretain what they have. They give a little now and then to ease their\nconscience, but have not overcome their love for this world. They\ndo not sacrifice for God. The Lord has raised up others that prize\neternal life, and that can feel and realize something of the value of\nthe soul, and they have freely bestowed their means to advance the\ncause of God. The work is closing; and soon the means of those\nwho have kept their riches, their large farms, their cattle, etc., will\nnot be wanted. I saw the Lord turn to such in anger, in wrath, and\nrepeat these words: \u201cGo to now, ye rich men.\u201d He has called, but\nyou would not hear. Love of this world has drowned His voice. Now\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nHe has no use for you, and lets you go, bidding you: \u201cGo to now, ye\nrich men.\u201d\nOh, I saw it was an awful thing to be thus forsaken by the Lord\u2014\na fearful thing to hold onto a perishable substance here, when He\nhas said that if we will sell and give alms, we can lay up treasure in\nheaven. I was shown that as the work is closing up, and the truth is\ngoing forth in mighty power, these rich men will bring their means\nand lay it at the feet of the servants of God, begging them to accept\nit. The answer from the servants of God will be: \u201cGo to now, ye\nrich men. Your means is not needed. Ye withheld it when ye could\ndo good with it in advancing the cause of God. The needy have\nsuffered; they have not been blessed by your means. God will not\naccept your riches now. Go to now, ye rich men.\u201d\nThen I was directed to these words: \u201cBehold, the hire of the\nlaborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept\nback by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are\nentered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.\u201d I saw that God is not in\nall the riches that are obtained. Satan often has much more to do with\nacquiring property than God. Much of it is obtained by oppressing\nthe hireling in his wages. The naturally covetous rich man obtains\nhis riches by grinding down the hireling, and taking advantage of[176]\nindividuals wherever he can, thereby adding to a treasure that will\neat his flesh as it were fire.\nA strictly honest, honorable course has not been taken by some.\nSuch must take a very different course and work fast to redeem the\ntime. Many Sabbathkeepers are at fault here. Advantage is taken\neven of their poor brethren, and those who have an abundance exact\nmore than the real worth of things, more than they would pay for\nthe same things, while these same brethren are embarrassed and\ndistressed for want of means. God knows all these things. Every\nselfish act, every covetous extortion, will bring its reward.\nI saw that it is cruel and unjust to have no consideration for a\nbrother\u2019s situation. If he is distressed, or poor, yet doing the best he\ncan, allowance should be made for him, and even the full value of\nthings he may purchase of the wealthy should not be exacted; but\nthey should have bowels of compassion for him. God will approve of\nsuch kindly acts, and the doer will not lose his reward. But a fearful\nRich Young Man 169\naccount stands against many Sabbathkeepers for close, covetous\nacts.\nI was pointed back to a time when there were but few who\nlistened to and embraced the truth. They had not much of this world\u2019s\ngoods. The wants of the cause were divided among a very few. Then\nit was necessary for some to sell their houses and lands, and obtain\ncheaper to serve them as a shelter, or home, while their means were\nfreely and generously lent to the Lord, to publish the truth, and to\notherwise aid in advancing the cause of God. As I beheld these\nself-sacrificing ones, I saw that they had endured privation for the\nbenefit of the cause. I saw an angel standing by them, pointing them\nupward, and saying: \u201cYe have bags in heaven! Ye have bags in\nheaven that wax not old! Endure unto the end, and great will be your\nreward.\u201d\nGod has been moving upon many hearts. The truth for which a [177]\nfew sacrificed so much, in order to get it before others, has triumphed,\nand multitudes have laid hold of it. God in His providence has moved\nupon those who have means, and has brought them into the truth,\nthat as His work increases, the wants of the cause may be met. Much\nmeans has been brought into the ranks of Sabbathkeepers, and I saw\nthat at present God does not call for the houses His people need to\nlive in, unless expensive houses are exchanged for cheaper ones.\nBut if those who have an abundance do not hear His voice, cut loose\nfrom the world, and dispose of a portion of their property and lands,\nand sacrifice for God, He will pass them by, and call for those who\nare willing to do anything for Jesus, even to sell their homes to meet\nthe wants of the cause. God will have freewill offerings. Those who\ngive must esteem it a privilege to do so.\nSome give of their abundance, but yet they feel no lack. They\ndo not particularly deny themselves of anything for the cause of\nChrist. They still have all that heart can wish. They give liberally\nand heartily. God regards it, and the action and motive are known\nand strictly marked by Him. They will not lose their reward. You\nwho cannot bestow so liberally must not excuse yourselves because\nyou cannot do as much as some others. Do what you can. Deny your-\nselves of some article that you can get along without, and sacrifice\nfor the cause of God. Like the widow, cast in your two mites. You\nwill actually give more than all those who give of their abundance;\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand you will know how sweet it is to deny self, to give to the needy,\nto sacrifice for the truth, and to lay up treasure in heaven.\nI was shown that the young, especially young men, who profess\nthe truth, have yet a lesson of self-denial to learn. If these made\nmore sacrifice for the truth, they would esteem it more highly. It\nwould affect their hearts, and purify their lives, and they would hold\nit more dear and sacred.\nThe young do not take the burden of the cause of God, or feel[178]\nany responsibility in regard to it. Is it because God has excused\nthem? Oh, no; they excuse themselves! They are eased, and others\nare burdened. They do not realize that they are not their own. Their\nstrength, their time, is not their own. They are bought with a price. A\ndear sacrifice was made for them, and unless they possess the spirit\nof self-denial and sacrifice, they can never possess the immortal\ninheritance.\n* * * * *\nChapter 31\u2014The Privilege and Duty of the Church\nThe following relates to the Battle Creek church, but describes\nthe condition and privileges of brethren and sisters scattered abroad:\nI saw that a thick cloud enveloped them, but that a few rays\nof light from Jesus pierced this cloud. I looked to see those who\nreceived this light, and saw individuals earnestly praying for victory.\nIt was their study to serve God. Their persevering faith brought them\nreturns. The light of heaven was shed upon them; but the cloud of\ndarkness over the church in general was thick. They were stupid\nand sluggish. My agony of soul was great. I asked the angel if\nthat darkness was necessary. Said he: \u201cLook ye!\u201d I then saw the\nchurch begin to rise, and earnestly plead with God, and rays of light\nbegan to penetrate this darkness, and the cloud was removed. The\npure light of heaven shone upon them, and with holy confidence\ntheir attention was attracted upward. Said the angel: \u201cThis is their\nprivilege and duty.\u201d\nSatan has come down in great power, knowing that his time is\nshort. His angels are busy, and a great share of the people of God\nsuffer themselves to be lulled to sleep by him. The cloud again\npassed over, and settled upon the church. I saw that it would be\nonly by earnest effort and persevering prayer that this spell would\nbe broken.\nThe alarming truths of the word of God had stirred the people [179]\nof God a little. Now and then they would make feeble efforts to\novercome, but they soon tired and sank back into the same lukewarm\nstate. I saw that they did not have perseverance and fixed determina-\ntion. Let the seeker for the salvation of God possess the same energy\nand earnestness that he would have for a worldly treasure, and the\nobject would be gained. I saw that the church may just as well drink\nof a full cup, as to hold an empty one in the hand or at the mouth.\nIt is not the plan of God to have some eased and others burdened.\nSome feel the weight and responsibility of the cause, and the neces-\nsity of their acting that they may gather with Christ and not scatter\n171\n172 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nabroad. Others go on free from any responsibility, acting as though\nthey had no influence. Such scatter abroad. God is not partial. All\nwho are made partakers of His salvation here, and who hope to\nshare the glories of the kingdom hereafter, must gather with Christ.\nEach must feel that he is responsible for his own case, and for the\ninfluence he exerts over others. If these maintain their Christian\nwalk, Jesus will be in them the hope of glory, and they will love\nto speak forth His praise that they may be refreshed. The cause of\ntheir Master will be near and dear to them. It will be their study to\nadvance His cause and to honor it by holy living. Said the angel:\n\u201cEvery talent God will require with usury.\u201d Every Christian must go\non from strength to strength, and employ all his powers in the cause\nof God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 32\u2014The Shaking\nNovember 20, 1857, I was shown the people of God, and saw\nthem mightily shaken. Some, with strong faith and agonizing cries,\nwere pleading with God. Their countenances were pale, and marked\nwith deep anxiety, expressive of their internal struggle. Firmness [180]\nand great earnestness were expressed in their countenances, while\nlarge drops of perspiration fell from their foreheads. Now and then\ntheir faces would light up with the marks of God\u2019s approbation, and\nagain the same solemn, earnest, anxious look would settle upon\nthem. [\u201cBlow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn\nassembly: gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble\nthe elders.... Let the priests the ministers of the Lord, weep between\nthe porch and the altar and let them say, Spare Thy people, O Lord,\nand give not Thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule\nover them: wherefore should they say among the people, where is\ntheir God?\u201d Joel 2:15-17.\n\u201cSubmit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he\nwill flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.\nCleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-\nminded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be\nturned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves\nin the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.\u201d James 4:7-10.\n\u201cGather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not\ndesired; before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the\nchaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, before\nthe day of the Lord\u2019s anger come upon you. Seek ye the Lord,\nall ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek\nrighteousness, seek meekness: It may be ye shall be hid in the day\nof the Lord\u2019s anger.\u201d Zephaniah 2:1-3.]\nEvil angels crowded around them, pressing their darkness upon\nthem, to shut out Jesus from their view, that their eyes might be\ndrawn to the darkness that surrounded them, and they distrust God\nand next murmur against Him. Their only safety was in keeping their\n173\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\neyes directed upward. Angels of God had charge over His people,\nand as the poisonous atmosphere from the evil angels was pressed\naround these anxious ones, the heavenly angels were continually\nwafting their wings over them, to scatter the thick darkness.\nSome, I saw, did not participate in this work of agonizing and\npleading. They seemed indifferent and careless. They were not\nresisting the darkness around them, and it shut them in like a thick[181]\ncloud. The angels of God left these, and I saw them hastening to\nthe assistance of those who were struggling with all their energies\nto resist the evil angels, and trying to help themselves by calling\nupon God with perseverance. But the angels left those who made no\neffort to help themselves, and I lost sight of them. As the praying\nones continued their earnest cries, a ray of light from Jesus would\nat times come to them, to encourage their hearts, and light up their\ncountenances.\nI asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown\nthat it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the\ncounsel of the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its\neffect upon the heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the\nstandard and pour forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this\nstraight testimony. They will rise up against it, and this will cause a\nshaking among God\u2019s people.\nThe testimony of the True Witness has not been half heeded. The\nsolemn testimony upon which the destiny of the church hangs has\nbeen lightly esteemed, if not entirely disregarded. This testimony\nmust work deep repentance, and all that truly receive it will obey it\nand be purified.\nSaid the angel: \u201cList ye!\u201d Soon I heard a voice that sounded like\nmany musical instruments, all in perfect strains, sweet and harmo-\nnious. It surpassed any music I had ever heard. It seemed to be so\nfull of mercy, compassion, and elevating, holy joy. It thrilled through\nmy whole being. Said the angel: \u201cLook ye!\u201d My attention was then\nturned to the company I had seen, who were mightily shaken. I\nwas shown those whom I had before seen weeping and praying with\nagony of spirit. The company of guardian angels around them had\nbeen doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from their head\nto their feet. They moved in exact order, firmly, like a company of\nsoldiers. Their countenances expressed the severe conflict which[182]\nShaking 175\nthey had endured, the agonizing struggle they had passed through.\nYet their features, marked with severe internal anguish, now shone\nwith the light and glory of heaven. They had obtained the victory,\nand it called forth from them the deepest gratitude, and holy, sacred\njoy.\nThe numbers of this company had lessened. Some had been\nshaken out, and left by the way. [\u201cI know thy works, that thou art\nneither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because\nthou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of\nMy mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,\nand have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,\nand miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\u201d Revelation 3:15-17.]\nThe careless and indifferent, who did not join with those who prized\nvictory and salvation enough to perseveringly plead and agonize for\nit, did not obtain it, and they were left behind in darkness, but their\nnumbers were immediately made up by others taking hold of the\ntruth and coming into the ranks. Still the evil angels pressed around\nthem, but they could have no power over them. [\u201cFor we wrestle not\nagainst flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,\nagainst the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual\nwickedness in high places. [Or, \u201cWicked spirits in heavenly places,\u201d\nas in the margin.] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God,\nthat ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done\nall, to stand. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth,\nand having on the breastplate of righteousness; and your feet shod\nwith the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the\nshield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery\ndarts of the wicked. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword\nof the Spirit, which is the word of God: praying always with all\nprayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with\nall perseverance and supplication for all saints.\u201d Ephesians 6:12-18.]\nI heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the truth in\ngreat power. It had effect. I saw those who had been bound; some\nwives had been bound by their husbands, and some children had\nbeen bound by their parents. The honest who had been held or [183]\nprevented from hearing the truth, now eagerly laid hold of it. All\nfear of their relatives was gone. The truth alone was exalted to them.\nIt was dearer and more precious than life. They had been hungering\n176 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand thirsting for truth. I asked what had made this great change.\nAn angel answered: \u201cIt is the latter rain, the refreshing from the\npresence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third angel.\u201d\nGreat power was with these chosen ones. Said the angel: \u201cLook\nye!\u201d My attention was turned to the wicked, or unbelievers. They\nwere all astir. The zeal and power with the people of God had\naroused and enraged them. Confusion, confusion was on every side.\nI saw measures taken against this company, who had the power and\nlight of God. Darkness thickened around them, yet there they stood,\napproved of God, and trusting in Him. I saw them perplexed. Next I\nheard them crying unto God earnestly. Through the day and night\ntheir cry ceased not. [\u201cAnd shall not God avenge his own elect,\nwhich cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? I\ntell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the\nson of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?\u201d Luke 18:7, 8.\nSee also Revelation 14:14, 15.] I heard these words: \u201cThy will, O\nGod, be done! If it can glorify Thy name, make a way of escape for\nThy people! Deliver us from the heathen round about us! They have\nappointed us unto death; but Thine arm can bring salvation.\u201d These\nare all the words that I can bring to mind. All seemed to have a deep\nsense of their unworthiness, and manifested entire submission to the\nwill of God. Yet like Jacob, every one, without an exception, was\nearnestly pleading and wrestling for deliverance.\nSoon after they had commenced their earnest cry, the angels, in\nsympathy, would have gone to their deliverance. But a tall, com-\nmanding angel suffered them not. Said he: \u201cThe will of God is not\nyet fulfilled. They must drink of the cup. They must be baptized\nwith the baptism.\u201d\nSoon I heard the voice of God which shook the heavens and the[184]\nearth. [\u201cThe Lord also shall roar out of zion, and utter his voice from\nJerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord\nwill be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of\nIsrael.\u201d Joel 3:16. See also Hebrews 12:26; Revelation 16:17.] There\nwas a mighty earthquake. Buildings were shaken down, and fell on\nevery side. I then heard a triumphant shout of victory, loud, musical,\nand clear. I looked upon this company, who, a short time before,\nwere in such distress and bondage. Their captivity was turned. A\nglorious light shone upon them. How beautiful they then looked!\nShaking 177\nAll weariness and marks of care were gone; health and beauty were\nseen in every countenance. Their enemies, the heathen around them,\nfell like dead men. They could not endure the light that shone upon\nthe delivered, holy ones. This light and glory remained upon them\nuntil Jesus was seen in the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried\ncompany were changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye,\nfrom glory to glory. The graves were opened and the saints came\nforth, clothed with immortality, crying: \u201cVictory over death and the\ngrave!\u201d and together with the living saints they were caught up to\nmeet their Lord in the air, while rich, musical shouts of glory and\nvictory proceeded from every immortal tongue.\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber Five\u2014Testimony for the Church [185]\nChapter 33\u2014The Laodicean Church\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nThe Lord has again visited me in much mercy. I have been\ngreatly afflicted for a few months past. Disease has pressed heavily\nupon me. For years I have been afflicted with dropsy and disease\nof the heart, which has had a tendency to depress my spirits and\ndestroy my faith and courage. The message to the Laodiceans has not\naccomplished that zealous repentance among God\u2019s people which I\nexpected to see, and my perplexity of mind has been great. Disease\nseemed to make continual progress upon me, and I thought that\nI must lie down in the grave. I had no desire to live, therefore I\ncould not take hold of faith and pray for my recovery. Often when I\nretired to rest at night I realized that I was in danger of losing my\nbreath before morning. In this state I fainted at midnight. Brethren\nAndrews and Loughborough were sent for, and earnest petitions\nwere offered to God in my behalf. The depression, the heavy weight,\nwas lifted from my aching heart, and I was taken off in vision, and\nshown the things which I now present before you.\nI saw that Satan had been trying to drive me to discouragement\nand despair, to make me desire death rather than life. I was shown\nthat it was not God\u2019s will that I should now cease from the work\nand lie down in the grave; for then the enemies of our faith would[186]\ntriumph, and the hearts of God\u2019s children would be made sad. I saw\nthat I should often feel anguish of spirit, and should suffer much;\nyet I had the promise that those around me would encourage and\nhelp me, that my courage and strength might not fail while I was so\nfiercely buffeted by the devil.\nI was shown that the testimony to the Laodiceans applies to\nGod\u2019s people at the present time, and the reason it has not accom-\nplished a greater work is because of the hardness of their hearts. But\nGod has given the message time to do its work. The heart must be\npurified from sins which have so long shut out Jesus. This fearful\nmessage will do its work. When it was first presented, it led to close\n180\nLaodicean Church 181\nexamination of heart. Sins were confessed, and the people of God\nwere stirred everywhere. Nearly all believed that this message would\nend in the loud cry of the third angel. But as they failed to see the\npowerful work accomplished in a short time, many lost the effect\nof the message. I saw that this message would not accomplish its\nwork in a few short months. It is designed to arouse the people of\nGod, to discover to them their backslidings, and to lead to zealous\nrepentance, that they may be favored with the presence of Jesus, and\nbe fitted for the loud cry of the third angel. As this message affected\nthe heart, it led to deep humility before God. Angels were sent in\nevery direction to prepare unbelieving hearts for the truth. The cause\nof God began to rise, and His people were acquainted with their\nposition. If the counsel of the True Witness had been fully heeded,\nGod would have wrought for His people in greater power. Yet the\nefforts made since the message has been given, have been blessed of\nGod, and many souls have been brought from error and darkness to\nrejoice in the truth.\nGod will prove His people. Jesus bears patiently with them,\nand does not spew them out of His mouth in a moment. Said the\nangel: \u201cGod is weighing His people.\u201d If the message had been of as\nshort duration as many of us supposed, there would have been no [187]\ntime for them to develop character. Many moved from feeling, not\nfrom principle and faith, and this solemn, fearful message stirred\nthem. It wrought upon their feelings, and excited their fears, but did\nnot accomplish the work which God designed that it should. God\nreads the heart. Lest His people should be deceived in regard to\nthemselves, He gives them time for the excitement to wear off, and\nthen proves them to see if they will obey the counsel of the True\nWitness.\nGod leads His people on, step by step. He brings them up to\ndifferent points calculated to manifest what is in the heart. Some\nendure at one point, but fall off at the next. At every advanced\npoint the heart is tested and tried a little closer. If the professed\npeople of God find their hearts opposed to this straight work, it\nshould convince them that they have a work to do to overcome, if\nthey would not be spewed out of the mouth of the Lord. Said the\nangel: \u201cGod will bring His work closer and closer to test and prove\nevery one of His people.\u201d Some are willing to receive one point; but\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwhen God brings them to another testing point, they shrink from\nit and stand back, because they find that it strikes directly at some\ncherished idol. Here they have opportunity to see what is in their\nhearts that shuts out Jesus. They prize something higher than the\ntruth, and their hearts are not prepared to receive Jesus. Individuals\nare tested and proved a length of time to see if they will sacrifice\ntheir idols and heed the counsel of the True Witness. If any will not\nbe purified through obeying the truth, and overcome their selfishness,\ntheir pride, and evil passions, the angels of God have the charge:\n\u201cThey are joined to their idols, let them alone,\u201d and they pass on to\ntheir work, leaving these with their sinful traits unsubdued, to the\ncontrol of evil angels. Those who come up to every point, and stand\nevery test, and overcome, be the price what it may, have heeded the\ncounsel of the True Witness, and they will receive the latter rain, and\nthus be fitted for translation.\nGod proves His people in this world. This is the fitting-up place[188]\nto appear in His presence. Here, in this world, in these last days,\npersons will show what power affects their hearts and controls their\nactions. If it is the power of divine truth, it will lead to good works.\nIt will elevate the receiver, and make him noblehearted and generous,\nlike his divine Lord. But if evil angels control the heart, it will be\nseen in various ways. The fruit will be selfishness, covetousness,\npride, and evil passions.\nThe heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.\nProfessors of religion are not willing to closely examine themselves\nto see whether they are in the faith; and it is a fearful fact that many\nare leaning on a false hope. Some lean upon an old experience which\nthey had years ago; but when brought down to this heart-searching\ntime, when all should have a daily experience, they have nothing to\nrelate. They seem to think that a profession of the truth will save\nthem. When they subdue those sins which God hates, Jesus will\ncome in and sup with them and they with Him. They will then draw\ndivine strength from Jesus, and will grow up in Him, and be able\nwith holy triumph to say: \u201cThanks be to God, which giveth us the\nvictory through our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d It would be more pleasing\nto the Lord if lukewarm professors of religion had never named His\nname. They are a continual weight to those who would be faithful\nfollowers of Jesus. They are a stumbling block to unbelievers, and\nLaodicean Church 183\nevil angels exult over them, and taunt the angels of God with their\ncrooked course. Such are a curse to the cause at home or abroad.\nThey draw nigh to God with their lips, while their heart is far from\nHim.\nI was shown that the people of God should not imitate the fash-\nions of the world. Some have done this, and are fast losing the\npeculiar, holy character which should distinguish them as God\u2019s\npeople. I was pointed back to God\u2019s ancient people, and was led [189]\nto compare their apparel with the mode of dress in these last days.\nWhat a difference! what a change! Then the women were not so\nbold as now. When they went in public, they covered their faces with\na veil. In these last days, fashions are shameful and immodest. They\nare noticed in prophecy. They were first brought in by a class over\nwhom Satan has entire control, who, \u201cbeing past feeling [without\nany conviction of the Spirit of God] have given themselves over\nunto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.\u201d If\nGod\u2019s professed people had not greatly departed from Him, there\nwould now be a marked difference between their dress and that of\nthe world. The small bonnets, exposing the face and head, show a\nlack of modesty. The hoops are a shame. The inhabitants of earth are\ngrowing more and more corrupt, and the line of distinction between\nthem and the Israel of God must be more plain, or the curse which\nfalls upon worldlings will fall on God\u2019s professed people.\nI was directed to the following scriptures. Said the angel: \u201cThey\nare to instruct God\u2019s people.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9, 10: \u201cIn like manner\nalso, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shame-\nfacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls,\nor costly array; but (which becometh women professing godliness)\nwith good works.\u201d 1 Peter 3:3-5: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that\noutward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or\nof putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart,\nin that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and\nquiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this\nmanner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God,\nadorned themselves.\u201d\nYoung and old, God is now testing you. You are deciding your\nown eternal destiny. Your pride, your love to follow the fashions\nof the world, your vain and empty conversation, your selfishness,\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nare all put in the scale, and the weight of evil is fearfully against[190]\nyou. You are poor, and miserable, and blind, and naked. While\nevil is increasing and taking deep root, it is choking the good seed\nwhich has been sown in the heart; and soon the word that was\ngiven concerning Eli\u2019s house will be spoken to the angels of God\nconcerning you: Your sins \u201cshall not be purged with sacrifice nor\noffering forever.\u201d Many, I saw, were flattering themselves that they\nwere good Christians, who have not a single ray of light from Jesus.\nThey know not what it is to be renewed by the grace of God. They\nhave no living experience for themselves in the things of God. And\nI saw that the Lord was whetting His sword in heaven to cut them\ndown. Oh, that every lukewarm professor could realize the clean\nwork that God is about to make among His professed people! Dear\nfriends, do not deceive yourselves concerning your condition. You\ncannot deceive God. Says the True Witness: \u201cI know thy works.\u201d\nThe third angel is leading up a people, step by step, higher and\nhigher. At every step they will be tested.\nThe plan of systematic benevolence [See Appendix.] is pleasing\nto God. I was pointed back to the days of the apostles, and saw that\nGod laid the plan by the descent of His Holy Spirit, and that by the\ngift of prophecy He counseled His people in regard to a system of\nbenevolence. All were to share in this work of imparting of their\ncarnal things to those who ministered unto them in spiritual things.\nThey were also taught that the widows and fatherless had a claim\nupon their charity. Pure and undefiled religion is defined, To visit\nthe widows and fatherless in their affliction, and to keep unspotted\nfrom the world. I saw that this was not merely to sympathize with\nthem by comforting words in their affliction, but to aid them, if\nneedy, with our substance. Young men and women to whom God\nhas given health can obtain a great blessing by aiding the widow and\nthe fatherless in their affliction. I saw that God requires young men\nto sacrifice more for the good of others. He claims more of them[191]\nthan they are willing to perform. If they keep themselves unspotted\nfrom the world, cease to follow its fashions, and lay by that which\nthe lovers of pleasure spend in useless articles to gratify pride, and\ngive it to the worthy afflicted ones, and to sustain the cause, they\nwill have the approval of Him who says, \u201cI know thy works.\u201d\nLaodicean Church 185\nThere is order in heaven, and God is well pleased with the efforts\nof His people in trying to move with system and order in His work\non earth. I saw that there should be order in the church of God, and\nthat system is needed in carrying forward successfully the last great\nmessage of mercy to the world. God is leading His people in the\nplan of systematic benevolence, and this is one of the very points\nto which God is bringing up His people which will cut the closest\nwith some. With them this cuts off the right arm, and plucks out\nthe right eye, while to others it is a great relief. To noble, generous\nsouls the demands upon them seem very small, and they cannot be\ncontent to do so little. Some have large possessions, and if they lay\nby them in store for charitable purposes as God has prospered them,\nthe offering seems to them like a large sum. The selfish heart clings\nas closely to a small offering as to a larger one, and makes a small\nsum look very large.\nI was pointed back to the commencement of this last work. Then\nsome who loved the truth could consistently talk of sacrificing. They\ndevoted much to the cause of God, to send the truth to others. They\nhave sent their treasure beforehand to heaven. Brethren, you who\nhave received the truth at a later period, and who have large posses-\nsions, God has called you into the field, not merely that you may\nenjoy the truth, but that you may aid with your substance in carrying\nforward this great work. And if you have an interest in this work,\nyou will venture out and invest something in it, that others may be\nsaved by your efforts, and you reap with them the final reward. Great\nsacrifices have been made and privations endured to place the truth [192]\nin a clear light before you. Now God calls upon you, in your turn, to\nmake great efforts and to sacrifice in order to place the truth before\nthose who are in darkness. God requires this. You profess to believe\nthe truth; let your works testify to the fact. Unless your faith works,\nit is dead. Nothing but a living faith will save you in the fearful\nscenes which are just before you.\nI saw that it is time for those who have large possessions to begin\nto work fast. It is time that they were not only laying by them in store\nas God is now prospering them, but as He has prospered them. In\nthe days of the apostles, plans were especially laid that some should\nnot be eased and others burdened. Arrangements were made that all\nshould share equally in the burdens of the church of God according\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto their several abilities. Said the angel: \u201cThe ax must be laid at\nthe root of the tree.\u201d Those who, like Judas, have set their hearts\nupon earthly treasure will complain as he did. His heart coveted\nthe costly ointment poured upon Jesus, and he sought to hide his\nselfishness under a pious, conscientious regard for the poor: \u201cWhy\nwas not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to\nthe poor?\u201d He wished that he had the ointment in his possession; it\nwould not thus be lavished upon the Saviour. He would apply it to\nhis own use; sell it for money. He prized his Lord just enough to\nsell Him to wicked men for a few pieces of silver. As Judas brought\nup the poor as an excuse for his selfishness, so professed Christians,\nwhose hearts are covetous, will seek to hide their selfishness under a\nput-on conscientiousness. Oh, they fear that in adopting systematic\nbenevolence we are becoming like the nominal churches! \u201cLet not\nthy left hand know what thy right hand doeth.\u201d They seem to have a\nconscientious desire to follow exactly the Bible as they understand\nit in this matter; but they entirely neglect the plain admonition of\nChrist: \u201cSell that ye have, and give alms.\u201d\n\u201cTake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of[193]\nthem.\u201d Some think this text teaches that they must be secret in their\nworks of charity. And they do but very little, excusing themselves\nbecause they do not know just how to give. But Jesus explained\nit to His disciples as follows: \u201cTherefore when thou doest thine\nalms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do\nin the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of\nmen. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.\u201d They gave to\nbe regarded noble and generous by men. They received praise of\nmen, and Jesus taught His disciples that this was all the reward they\nwould have. With many, the left hand does not know what the right\nhand does, for the right hand does nothing worthy of the notice of\nthe left hand. This lesson of Jesus to His disciples was to rebuke\nthose who wished to receive glory of men. They performed their\nalmsgiving at some very public gathering; and before doing this, a\npublic proclamation was made heralding their generosity before the\npeople; and many gave large sums merely to have their name exalted\nby men. And the means given in this manner was often extorted\nfrom others, by oppressing the hireling in his wages, and grinding\nthe face of the poor.\nLaodicean Church 187\nI was shown that this scripture does not apply to those who have\nthe cause of God at heart, and use their means humbly to advance\nit. I was directed to these texts: \u201cLet your light so shine before\nmen, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father\nwhich is in heaven.\u201d \u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d I was\nshown that Scripture testimony will harmonize when it is rightly\nunderstood. The good works of the children of God are the most\neffectual preaching that the unbeliever has. He thinks that there\nmust be strong motives that actuate the Christian to deny self, and\nuse his possessions in trying to save his fellow men. It is unlike\nthe spirit of the world. Such fruits testify that the possessors are [194]\ngenuine Christians. They seem to be constantly reaching upward to\na treasure that is imperishable.\nWith every gift and offering there should be a suitable object\nbefore the giver, not to uphold any in idleness, not to be seen of men\nor to get a great name, but to glorify God by advancing His cause.\nSome make large donations to the cause of God while their brother\nwho is poor, may be suffering close by them, and they do nothing to\nrelieve him. Little acts of kindness performed for their brother in a\nsecret manner would bind their hearts together, and would be noticed\nin heaven. I saw that in their prices and wages the rich should make\na difference in favor of the afflicted and widows and the worthy poor\namong them. But it is too often the case that the rich take advantage\nof the poor, reaping every benefit that is to be gained, and exacting\nthe last penny for every favor. It is all written in heaven. \u201cI know\nthy works.\u201d\nThe greatest sin which now exists in the church is covetousness.\nGod frowns upon His professed people for their selfishness. His\nservants have sacrificed their time and strength to carry them the\nword of life, and many have shown by their works that they prize it\nbut lightly. If they can help the servant of God just as well as not,\nthey sometimes do it; but they often let him pass on, and do but little\nfor him. If they employ a day laborer, he must be paid full wages.\nBut not so with the self-sacrificing servant of God. He labors for\nthem in word and doctrine; he carries the heavy burden of the work\non his soul; he patiently shows from the word of God the dangerous\nerrors which are hurtful to the soul; he enforces the necessity of\nimmediately tearing up the weeds which choke the good seed sown;\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhe brings out of the storehouse of God\u2019s word things new and old\nto feed the flock of God. All acknowledge that they have been\nbenefited; but the poisonous weed, covetousness, is so deeply rooted\nthat they let the servant of God leave them without ministering to[195]\nhim of their temporal things. They have prized his wearing labor\njust as highly as their acts show. Says the True Witness: \u201cI know thy\nworks.\u201d\nI saw that God\u2019s servants are not placed beyond the temptations\nof Satan. They are often fearfully beset by the enemy, and have a\nhard battle to fight. If they could be released from their commission,\nthey would gladly labor with their hands. Their labor is called for\nby their brethren; but when they see it so lightly prized, they are\ndepressed. True, they look to the final settlement for their reward,\nand this bears them up; but their families must have food and cloth-\ning. Their time belongs to the church of God; it is not at their own\ndisposal. They sacrifice the society of their families to benefit others;\nand yet some who are benefited by their labors are indifferent to\ntheir wants. I saw that it is doing injustice to such to let them pass\non and deceive themselves. They think they are approved of God,\nwhen He despises their selfishness. Not only will these selfish ones\nbe called to render an account to God for the use they have made of\ntheir Lord\u2019s money, but all the depression and heartache which they\nhave brought upon God\u2019s chosen servants, and which have crippled\ntheir efforts, will be set to the account of the unfaithful stewards.\nThe True Witness declares: \u201cI know thy works.\u201d The selfish,\ncovetous heart will be tested. Some are not willing to devote to God\na very small portion of the increase of their earthly treasure. They\nwould start back with horror if you should speak of the principal.\nWhat have they sacrificed for God? Nothing. They profess to believe\nthat Jesus is coming; but their works deny their faith. Every person\nwill live out all the faith he has. Falsehearted professor, Jesus knows\nthy works. He hates your stinted offerings, your lame sacrifices.\nChapter 34\u2014Houses of Worship [196]\nI saw that many to whom God has entrusted means feel at liberty\nto use it freely for their own convenience in fitting up pleasant homes\nhere; but when they build a house in which to worship the great God\nwho inhabiteth eternity, they cannot afford to let Him have the use\nof the means which He has lent them. Each is not striving to excel\nthe other in showing his gratitude to God for the truth by doing all\nhe can to prepare a suitable place of worship; but some are trying to\ndo just as little as possible; and they feel that the means is as good\nas lost which they spend in preparing a place for the Most High to\nvisit them. Such an offering is lame, and not acceptable to God. I\nsaw that it would be much more pleasing to God if His people would\nshow as much wisdom in preparing a house for Him, as they do in\ntheir own dwellings.\nThe sacrifices and offerings of the children of Israel were com-\nmanded to be without blemish or spot, the best of the flock; and\nevery one of the people was required to share in this work. The\nwork of God for this time will be extensive. If you build a house\nfor the Lord, do not offend and limit Him by casting in your lame\nofferings. Put the very best offering into a house built for God. Let\nit be the very best you have; show an interest to make it convenient\nand comfortable. Some think that this is of no consequence because\ntime is so short. Then carry out the same in your dwellings, and in\nall your worldly arrangements.\nI saw that God could carry on His work without any of man\u2019s\nhelp; but this is not His plan. The present world is designed as a\nscene of probation for man. He is here to form a character which\nwill pass with him into the eternal world. Good and evil are placed\nbefore him, and his future state depends upon the choice he makes.\nChrist came to change the current of his thoughts and affections.\nHis heart must be removed from his earthly treasure, and placed [197]\nupon the heavenly. By his self-denial, God can be glorified. The\ngreat sacrifice has been made for man, and now he will be tested\n189\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand proved to see if he will follow the example of Jesus, and make\na sacrifice for his fellow man. Satan and his angels are combined\nagainst the people of God; but Jesus is seeking to purify them unto\nHimself. He requires them to advance His work. God has deposited\nwith His people in this world enough to carry forward His work\nwithout embarrassment, and it is His plan that the means which He\nhas entrusted to them be used judiciously. \u201cSell that ye have, and\ngive alms,\u201d is a part of God\u2019s sacred word. The servants of God must\narise, cry aloud, and spare not, \u201cshow My people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d The work of God is to become\nmore extensive, and if His people follow His counsel, there will\nnot be much means in their possession to be consumed in the final\nconflagration. All will have laid up their treasure where moth and\nrust cannot corrupt; and the heart will not have a cord to bind it to\nearth.\n* * * * *\nChapter 35\u2014Lessons from the Parables\nI was shown that the parable of the talents has not been fully\nunderstood. This important lesson was given to the disciples for the\nbenefit of Christians living in the last days. And these talents do not\nrepresent merely the ability to preach and instruct from the word\nof God. The parable applies to the temporal means which God has\nentrusted to His people. Those to whom the five and the two talents\nwere given, traded and doubled that which was committed to their\ntrust. God requires those who have possessions here, to put their\nmoney out to usury for Him\u2014to put it into the cause to spread the\ntruth. And if the truth lives in the heart of the receiver, he also will\naid with his substance in sending it to others; and through his efforts, [198]\nhis influence, and his means, other souls will embrace the truth, and\nbegin also to work for God. I saw that some of God\u2019s professed\npeople are like the man who hid his talent in the earth. They keep\ntheir possessions from doing good in the cause of God. They claim\nthat these are their own, and that they have a right to do what they\nplease with their own; and souls are not saved by judicious efforts\nmade by them with their Lord\u2019s money. Angels keep a faithful\nrecord of every man\u2019s work, and as judgment passes upon the house\nof God, the sentence of each is recorded by his name, and the angel\nis commissioned to spare not the unfaithful servants, but to cut them\ndown at the time of slaughter. And that which was committed to\ntheir trust is taken from them. Their earthly treasure is then swept\naway, and they have lost all. And the crowns they might have worn,\nhad they been faithful, are put upon the heads of those saved by the\nfaithful servants whose means was constantly in use for God. And\neveryone they have been the means of saving, adds stars to their\ncrown in glory, and increases their eternal reward.\nI was also shown that the parable of the unjust steward was to\nteach us a lesson. \u201cMake to yourselves friends of the mammon\nof unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into\neverlasting habitations.\u201d If we use our means to God\u2019s glory here,\n191\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwe lay up a treasure in heaven; and when earthly possessions are\nall gone, the faithful steward has Jesus and angels for his friends, to\nreceive him home to everlasting habitations.\n\u201cHe that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much.\u201d\nHe that is faithful in his earthly possessions, which are least, making\na judicious use of what God has lent him here, will be true to his\nprofession. \u201cHe that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.\u201d\nHe that will withhold from God that which He has lent him, will\nbe unfaithful in the things of God in every respect. \u201cIf therefore\nye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will[199]\ncommit to your trust the true riches?\u201d If we prove unfaithful in the\nmanagement of what God lends us here, He will never give us the\nimmortal inheritance. \u201cAnd if ye have not been faithful in that which\nis another man\u2019s, who shall give you that which is your own?\u201d Jesus\nhas purchased redemption for us. It is ours; but we are placed here\non probation to see if we will prove worthy of eternal life. God\nproves us by trusting us with earthly possessions. If we are faithful\nto impart freely of what He has lent us, to advance His cause, God\ncan entrust to us the immortal inheritance. \u201cYe cannot serve God\nand mammon.\u201d \u201cIf any man love the world, the love of the Father is\nnot in him.\u201d\nGod is displeased with the slack, loose manner in which many\nof His professed people conduct their worldly business. They seem\nto have lost all sense of the fact that the property they are using\nbelongs to God, and that they must render to Him an account of\ntheir stewardship. Some leave their worldly business in perfect\nconfusion. Satan has his eye on it all, and he strikes at a favorable\nopportunity, and by his management takes much means out of the\nranks of Sabbathkeepers. And this means goes into his ranks. Some\nwho are aged are unwilling to make any settlement of their worldly\nbusiness, and in an unexpected moment they sicken and die. Their\nchildren who have no interest in the truth, take the property. Satan\nhas managed it as suited him. \u201cIf therefore ye have not been faithful\nin the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true\nriches? And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another\nman\u2019s, who shall give you that which is your own?\u201d\nI was shown the awful fact that Satan and his angels have had\nmore to do with the management of the property of God\u2019s professed\nLessons from the Parables 193\npeople than the Lord has. Stewards of the last days are unwise. They\nsuffer Satan to control their business matters, and get into his ranks\nwhat belongs to, and should be in, the cause of God. God takes [200]\nnotice of you, unfaithful stewards; He will call you to account. I\nsaw that the stewards of God can by faithful, judicious management\nkeep their business in this world square, exact, and straight. And it\nis especially the privilege and duty of the aged, the feeble, and those\nwho have no children, to place their means where it can be used in\nthe cause of God if they should be suddenly taken away. But I saw\nthat Satan and his angels exult over their success in this matter. And\nthose who should be wise heirs of salvation almost willingly let their\nLord\u2019s money slip out of their hands into the enemy\u2019s ranks. In this\nway they strengthen Satan\u2019s kingdom, and seem to feel very easy\nabout it!\n* * * * *\nChapter 36\u2014Surety for Unbelievers\nI saw that God was displeased with His people for becoming\nsurety for unbelievers. I was directed to these texts: Proverbs 22:26:\n\u201cBe not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are\nsureties for debts.\u201d Proverbs 11:15: \u201cHe that is surety for a stranger\nshall smart for it: and he that hateth suretyship is sure.\u201d Unfaithful\nstewards! They pledge that which belongs to another,\u2014their heav-\nenly Father,\u2014and Satan stands ready to aid his children to wrench it\nout of their hands. Sabbathkeepers should not be in partnership with\nunbelievers. God\u2019s people trust too much to the words of strangers,\nand ask their advice and counsel when they should not. The enemy\nmakes them his agents, and works through them to perplex and take\nfrom God\u2019s people.\nSome have no tact at wise management of worldly matters. They\nlack the necessary qualifications, and Satan takes advantage of them.\nWhen this is the case, such should not remain in ignorance of their\ntask. They should be humble enough to counsel with their brethren,\nin whose judgment they can have confidence, before they carry out\nplans. I was directed to this text: \u201cBear ye one another\u2019s burdens.\u201d[201]\nSome are not humble enough to let those who have judgment cal-\nculate for them until they have followed their own plans, and have\ninvolved themselves in difficulties. Then they see the necessity of\nhaving the counsel and judgment of their brethren; but how much\nheavier the burden then than at first. Brethren should not go to law\nif it can be possibly avoided; for they thus give the enemy great\nadvantage to entangle and perplex them. It would be better to make\na settlement at some loss.\n* * * * *\n194\nChapter 37\u2014Oath Taking\nI saw that some of God\u2019s children have made a mistake in regard\nto oath taking, and Satan has taken advantage of this to oppress them,\nand take from them their Lord\u2019s money. I saw that the words of our\nLord, \u201cSwear not at all,\u201d do not touch the judicial oath. \u201cLet your\ncommunication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than\nthese cometh of evil.\u201d This refers to common conversation. Some\nexaggerate in their language. Some swear by their own life; others\nswear by their head\u2014as sure as they live; as sure as they have a\nhead. Some take heaven and earth to witness that such things are so.\nSome hope that God will strike them out of existence if what they\nare saying is not true. It is this kind of common swearing against\nwhich Jesus warns His disciples.\nWe have men placed over us for rulers, and laws to govern the\npeople. Were it not for these laws, the condition of the world would\nbe worse than it is now. Some of these laws are good, others are\nbad. The bad have been increasing, and we are yet to be brought\ninto strait places. But God will sustain His people in being firm\nand living up to the principles of His word. When the laws of men\nconflict with the word and law of God, we are to obey the latter,\nwhatever the consequences may be. The law of our land requiring [202]\nus to deliver a slave to his master, we are not to obey; and we must\nabide the consequences of violating this law. The slave is not the\nproperty of any man. God is his rightful master, and man has no\nright to take God\u2019s workmanship into his hands, and claim him as\nhis own.\nI saw that the Lord still has something to do with the laws of the\nland. While Jesus is in the sanctuary, God\u2019s restraining Spirit is felt\nby rulers and people. But Satan controls to a great extent the mass\nof the world, and were it not for the laws of the land, we should\nexperience much suffering. I was shown that when it is actually\nnecessary, and they are called upon to testify in a lawful manner, it\n195\n196 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nis no violation of God\u2019s word for His children to solemnly take God\nto witness that what they say is the truth, and nothing but the truth.\nMan is so corrupt that laws are made to throw the responsibility\nupon his own head. Some men do not fear to lie to their fellow\nman; but they have been taught, and the restraining Spirit of God has\nimpressed them, that it is a fearful thing to lie to God. The case of\nAnanias and Sapphira his wife is given for an example. The matter\nis carried from man to God, so that if one bears false witness, it is\nnot to man, but to the great God, who reads the heart, and knows the\nexact truth in every case. Our laws make it a high crime to take a\nfalse oath. God has often visited judgment upon the false swearer,\nand even while the oath was on his lips, the destroying angel has cut\nhim down. This was to prove a terror to evildoers.\nI saw that if there is anyone on earth who can consistently tes-\ntify under oath, it is the Christian. He lives in the light of God\u2019s\ncountenance. He grows strong in His strength. And when matters of\nimportance must be decided by law, there is no one who can so well\nappeal to God as the Christian. I was bidden by the angel to notice\nthat God swears by Himself. Genesis 22:16; Hebrews 6:13, 17. He [203]\nswore to Abraham (Genesis 26:3), to Isaac (Psalm 105:9; Jeremiah\n11:5), and to David (Psalm 132:11; Acts 2:30). God required of the\nchildren of Israel an oath between man and man. Exodus 22:10, 11.\nJesus submitted to the oath in the hour of His trial. The high priest\nsaid unto Him: \u201cI adjure Thee by the living God, that Thou tell us\nwhether Thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\u201d Jesus said unto him:\n\u201cThou hast said.\u201d If Jesus in His teachings to His disciples referred to\nthe judicial oath, He would have reproved the high priest, and there\nenforced His teachings, for the good of His followers present. Satan\nhas been pleased that some have viewed oath taking in a wrong light;\nfor it has given him opportunity to oppress them and take from them\ntheir Lord\u2019s money. The stewards of God must be more wise, lay\ntheir plans, and prepare themselves to withstand Satan\u2019s devices; for\nhe is to make greater efforts than ever before.\nSome, I saw, have a prejudice against our rulers and laws; but if\nit were not for law, this world would be in an awful condition. God\nrestrains our rulers; for the hearts of all are in His hands. Bounds\nare set, beyond which they cannot go. Many of the rulers are those\nwhom Satan controls; but I saw that God has His agents, even among\nOath Taking 197\nthe rulers. And some of them will yet be converted to the truth. They\nare now acting the part that God would have them. When Satan\nworks through his agents, propositions are made, that, if carried out,\nwould impede the work of God and produce great evil. The good\nangels move upon these agents of God to oppose such propositions\nwith strong reasons, which Satan\u2019s agents cannot resist. A few of\nGod\u2019s agents will have power to bear down a great mass of evil.\nThus the work will go on until the third message has done its work,\nand at the loud cry of the third angel, these agents will have an\nopportunity to receive the truth, and some of them will be converted,\nand endure with the saints through the time of trouble. When Jesus [204]\nleaves the most holy, His restraining Spirit is withdrawn from rulers\nand people. They are left to the control of evil angels. Then such\nlaws will be made by the counsel and direction of Satan, that unless\ntime should be very short, no flesh could be saved.\n* * * * *\nChapter 38\u2014Errors in Diet\nDear Brother and Sister A,\nThe Lord has seen fit in His goodness to give me a vision at this\nplace; and among the different things shown were some relating\nto you. I saw that all was not right with you. The enemy has\nbeen seeking your destruction, and endeavoring to influence others\nthrough you. I saw that you both take an exalted position that God\nhas never assigned you, and that you both consider yourselves far\nin advance of the people of God. I saw you looking to Battle Creek\nwith jealousy and suspicion. You would place your hands in there,\nand mold their acts and doings to what you consider would be right.\nYou are noticing little things that you do not understand, that you\nhave not the least to do with, and that in no way concern you. God\nhas committed His work at B.C. to chosen servants. He has laid the\nburden of the work upon them. Angels of God are commissioned to\nhave oversight of the work; and if it does not move right, those who\nare at the head of the work will be corrected, and things will move\nin God\u2019s order without interference of this or that individual.\nI saw that God wants you to turn your attention to yourselves.\nTry your motives. You are deceived in regard to yourselves. You\nhave an appearance of humility, and this has influence with others,\nand leads them to think that you are far advanced in the Christian\nlife; but when your peculiar notions are touched, self rises at once,\nand you manifest a willful, stubborn spirit. This is a sure evidence\nthat you do not possess true humility.\nI saw that you had mistaken notions about afflicting your bodies,[205]\ndepriving yourselves of nourishing food. These things lead some of\nthe church to think that God is surely with you, or you would not\ndeny self, and sacrifice thus. But I saw that none of these things\nwill make you more holy. The heathen do all this, but receive no\nreward for it. A broken and contrite spirit before God is in His sight\nof great price. I saw that your views concerning these things are\nerroneous, and that you are looking at the church and watching them,\n198\nErrors in Diet 199\nnoticing little things, when your attention should be turned to your\nown soul\u2019s interest. God has not laid the burden of His flock upon\nyou. You think that the church is upon the background, because they\ncannot see things as you do, and because they do not follow the same\nrigid course which you think you are required to pursue. I saw that\nyou are deceived in regard to your own duty and the duty of others.\nSome have gone to extremes in regard to diet. They have taken a\nrigid course, and lived so very plain that their health has suffered,\ndisease has strengthened in the system, and the temple of God has\nbeen weakened.\nI was referred back to our experience in Rochester, New York.\nI saw that when we lived there we did not eat nourishing food as\nwe should, and disease nearly carried us to the grave. I saw that as\nGod gives His beloved sleep, He is willing to grant them suitable\nfood to nourish the strength. The motive we had was pure. It was\nto save means, that the paper might be sustained. We were poor. I\nsaw that the fault then was in the church. Those who had means\nwere covetous and selfish. If these had done their part, the burden\nupon us would have been lightened; but as some did not do their\npart, we were burdened and others eased. I saw that God does not\nrequire anyone to take a course of such rigid economy as to weaken\nor injure the temple of God. There are duties and requirements in\nHis word to humble the church and cause them to afflict their souls,\nand there is no need of making crosses and manufacturing duties to [206]\ndistress the body in order to cause humility. All this is outside of the\nword of God.\nThe time of trouble is just before us; and then stern necessity will\nrequire the people of God to deny self, and to eat merely enough to\nsustain life; but God will prepare us for that time. In that fearful hour\nour necessity will be God\u2019s opportunity to impart His strengthening\npower, and to sustain His people. But now God requires them to\nlabor with their hands, the thing that is good, and lay by them in store\nas He has prospered them, and do their part in sustaining the cause of\ntruth. This is a duty enjoined upon all who are not especially called\nto labor in word and doctrine, to devote their time to proclaiming to\nothers the way of life and salvation.\nThose who labor with their hands must nourish their strength to\nperform this labor, and those also who labor in word and doctrine\n200 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmust nourish their strength; for Satan and his evil angels are warring\nagainst them to tear down their strength. They should seek rest of\nbody and mind from wearing labor when they can, and should eat of\nnourishing, strengthening food to build up their strength; for they\nwill be obliged to exercise all the strength they have. I saw that it\ndoes not glorify God in the least for any of His people to make a\ntime of trouble for themselves. There is a time of trouble just before\nGod\u2019s people, and He will prepare them for that fearful conflict.\nI saw that your views concerning swine\u2019s flesh [This remarkable\ntestimony was written October 21, 1858, nearly five years before\nthe great vision of 1863, in which the light upon health reform was\ngiven. When the right time came, the subject was given in a manner\nto move all our people. How wonderful are the wisdom and goodness\nof God! It might be as wrong to crowd the milk, salt, and sugar\nquestion now, as the pork question in 1858.\u2014J.W.,note to second\nedition.] would prove no injury if you have them to yourselves; but\nin your judgment and opinion you have made this question a test,\nand your actions have plainly shown your faith in this matter. If God[207]\nrequires His people to abstain from swine\u2019s flesh, He will convict\nthem on the matter. He is just as willing to show His honest children\ntheir duty, as to show their duty to individuals upon whom He has\nnot laid the burden of His work. If it is the duty of the church to\nabstain from swine\u2019s flesh, God will discover it to more than two or\nthree. He will teach His church their duty.\nGod is leading out a people, not a few separate individuals here\nand there, one believing this thing, another that. Angels of God are\ndoing the work committed to their trust. The third angel is leading\nout and purifying a people, and they should move with him unitedly.\nSome run ahead of the angels that are leading this people; but they\nhave to retrace every step, and meekly follow no faster than the\nangels lead. I saw that the angels of God would lead His people\nno faster than they could receive and act upon the important truths\nthat are communicated to them. But some restless spirits do not\nmore than half do up their work. As the angel leads them, they get\nin haste for something new, and rush on without divine guidance,\nand thus bring confusion and discord into the ranks. They do not\nspeak or act in harmony with the body. I saw that you both must\nspeedily be brought where you are willing to be led, instead of\nErrors in Diet 201\ndesiring to lead, or Satan will step in and lead you in his way, to\nfollow his counsel. Some look at your set notions, and consider them\nan evidence of humility. They are deceived. You both are making\nwork for repentance.\nBrother A, you are naturally close and covetous. You tithe mint\nand rue, but neglect the weightier matters. When the young man\ncame to Jesus, and asked what he should do to have eternal life,\nJesus told him to keep the commandments. He declared that he had\ndone so. Said Jesus: Yet lackest thou one thing. Go sell that thou\nhast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven.\nThe result was the young man went away sorrowful, for he had [208]\ngreat possessions. I saw that you had wrong ideas. God requires\neconomy of His people; but some have stretched their economy into\nmeanness. I wish that you could see your case as it is. The true spirit\nof sacrifice, which is acceptable to God, you do not possess. You\nlook at others, and watch them, and if they do not bring themselves\nto the same rigid course that you follow, you can do nothing for\nthem. Your souls are withering beneath the blighting influence of\nyour own errors. A fanatical spirit is with you, that you take to be\nGod\u2019s Spirit. You are deceived. You cannot bear the plain, cutting\ntestimony. You would have a smooth testimony borne to you; but\nwhen anyone reproves your wrongs, how quick self rises. Your\nspirits are not humbled. You have a work to do.... Such acts, such\na spirit, I saw, was the fruit of your errors, and the fruit of setting\nup your judgment and notions as a rule for others, and against those\nwhom God has called into the field. You have both overreached the\nmark.\nI saw that you had thought this one and that one were called to\nlabor in the field, when you know nothing of the matter. You cannot\nread the heart. If you had drunk deep of the truth of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, you would not be so free to tell who were called of God,\nand who were not. The fact that one can pray and talk well is no\nevidence that God has called him. Everyone has an influence, and\nthat influence should tell for God; but the question whether this one\nor that one should devote his time to labor for souls, is of the deepest\nimportance, and none but God can decide who shall engage in the\nsolemn work. There were good men in the apostles\u2019 days, men\nwho could pray with power and talk to the point; yet the apostles,\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwho had power over unclean spirits and could heal the sick, dared\nnot with merely their wisdom set one apart for the holy work of\nbeing mouthpiece for God. They waited unmistakable evidence of\nthe manifestation of the Holy Spirit. I saw that God had laid upon[209]\nHis chosen ministers the duty of deciding who was fit for the holy\nwork; and in union with the church and the manifest tokens of the\nHoly Spirit, they were to decide who should go and who were unfit\nto go. I saw that if it should be left to a few individuals here and\nthere to decide who was sufficient for this great work, confusion and\ndistraction everywhere would be the fruit.\nGod has repeatedly shown that persons should not be encouraged\ninto the field without unmistakable evidence that He has called them.\nThe Lord will not entrust the burden for his flock to unqualified\nindividuals. Those whom God calls must be men of deep experience,\ntried and proved, men of sound judgment, men who will dare to\nreprove sin in the spirit of meekness, men who understand how to\nfeed the flock. God knows the heart, and He knows whom to select.\nBrother and Sister A may decide in this matter, and be all wrong.\nYour judgment is imperfect, and can be no evidence in this matter. I\nsaw that you were drawing off from the church, and if you continue\nto do so, you will have enough of it; for God will let you go, to suffer\nby following your own way.\nNow God invites you to get right, to try your motives, and to\npress into harmony with His people.\nMannsville, New York,\nOctober 21, 1858.\nNumber Six\u2014Testimony for the Church [210]\nChapter 39\u2014Slackness Reproved\n[See Appendix.]\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nThe Lord has again visited me in mercy, in a time of bereavement\nand great affliction. December 23, 1860, I was taken off in vision,\nand was shown the wrongs of individuals which have affected the\ncause. I dare not withhold the testimony from the church to spare\nthe feelings of individuals.\nI was shown the low state of God\u2019s people; that God had not\ndeparted from them, but that they had departed from Him, and had\nbecome lukewarm. They possess the theory of the truth, but lack\nits saving power. As we near the close of time, Satan comes down\nwith great power, knowing that his time is short. Especially will his\npower be exercised upon the remnant. He will war against them,\nand seek to divide and scatter them, that they may grow weak and\nbe overthrown. The people of God should move understandingly,\nand should be united in their efforts. They should be of the same\nmind, of the same judgment; then their efforts will not be scattered,\nbut will tell forcibly in the upbuilding of the cause of present truth.\nOrder must be observed, and there must be union in maintaining\norder, or Satan will take the advantage.\nI saw that the enemy would come in every way possible to\ndishearten the people of God and perplex and trouble them, and that[211]\nthey should move understandingly, and prepare themselves for the\nattacks of Satan. Matters pertaining to the church should not be left\nin an unsettled condition. Steps should be taken to secure church\nproperty for the cause of God, that the work may not be retarded in\nits progress, and that the means which persons wish to dedicate to\nGod\u2019s cause may not slip into the enemy\u2019s ranks. I saw that God\u2019s\npeople should act wisely, and leave nothing undone on their part\nto place the business of the church in a secure state. Then after\nall is done that they can do, they should trust the Lord to overrule\n204\nSlackness Reproved 205\nthese things for them, that Satan take no advantage of God\u2019s remnant\npeople. It is Satan\u2019s time to work. A stormy future is before us;\nand the church should be awake to make an advance move that they\nmay stand securely against his plans. It is time that something was\ndone. God is not pleased to have His people leave the matters of\nthe church at loose ends, and suffer the enemy to have the whole\nadvantage and control affairs as best pleases him.\nI was shown the wrong stand taken by Brother B in the Review\nin regard to organization, and the distracting influence he exerted.\nHe did not sufficiently weigh the matter. His articles were perfectly\ncalculated to have a scattering influence, to lead minds to wrong\nconclusions, and to encourage many in their slack ideas of managing\nmatters relating to the cause of God. Those who do not feel the\nweight of this cause upon them do not feel the necessity of anything\nbeing done to establish church order. Those who have long borne\nthe burden look to the future and weigh matters. They are convinced\nthat steps must be taken to place the matters of the church in a more\nsecure position, where Satan cannot come in and take advantage.\nBrother B\u2019s articles caused those who fear order to look with suspi-\ncion upon the suggestions of those who by the special providence of\nGod move out in the important matters of the church. And when he\nsaw that his position would not bear, he failed to frankly acknowl- [212]\nedge his error, and labor to efface the wrong impression he had\nmade.\nI saw that in temporal matters Brother B was too easy and neg-\nligent. He has lacked energy, considering it a virtue to leave to the\nLord that which the Lord has left to him. It is only in cases of great\nemergency that the Lord interposes for us. We have a work to do,\nburdens and responsibilities to bear, and in thus doing we obtain\nan experience. Brother B manifests the same character in spiritual\nmatters as in his temporal affairs. There is a lack of zeal and earnest-\nness to make thorough work. All should act with more discretion\nand wisdom in regard to the things of God than they manifest in\ntemporal things to secure an earthly possession.\nBut while God\u2019s people are justified in securing church property\nin a lawful manner, they should be careful to maintain their peculiar\nand holy character. I saw that unconsecrated persons would take\nadvantage of the position which the church has recently taken, and\n206 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwould overstep the bounds, carry matters to extremes, and wound\nthe cause of God. Some will move without wisdom or judgment,\nengage in lawsuits that might be avoided, mingle with the world,\npartake of its spirit, and influence others to follow their example.\nOne professed Christian who moves unadvisedly does much harm\nto the cause of present truth. Evil takes root much more readily than\ngood, and flourishes when good and right languish unless carefully\nnourished.\nI was pointed back, and saw that in every important move, every\ndecision made or point gained by God\u2019s people, some have arisen\nto carry matters to extremes, and to move in an extravagant man-\nner, which has disgusted unbelievers, distressed God\u2019s people, and\nbrought the cause of God into disrepute. The people whom God is\nleading out in these last days, will be troubled with just such things.\nBut much evil will be avoided if the ministers of Christ will be of one\nmind, united in their plans of action, and united in effort. If they will[213]\nstand together, sustain one another, and faithfully reprove and rebuke\nwrong, they will soon cause it to wither. But Satan has controlled\nthese matters very much. Private members and even preachers have\nsympathized with disaffected ones who have been reproved for their\nwrongs, and division of feeling has been the result. The one who\nhas ventured out and discharged his disagreeable duty by faithfully\nmeeting error and wrong, is grieved and wounded that he receives\nnot the fullest sympathy of his preaching brethren. He becomes\ndiscouraged in discharging these painful duties, lays down the cross,\nand withholds the pointed testimony. His soul is shut up in darkness,\nand the church suffer for the lack of the very testimony which God\ndesigned should live among His people. Satan\u2019s object is gained\nwhen the faithful testimony is suppressed. Those who so readily\nsympathize with the wrong consider it a virtue; but they realize not\nthat they are exerting a scattering influence, and that they themselves\nhelp to carry out Satan\u2019s plans.\nI saw that many souls have been destroyed by their brethren\nunwisely sympathizing with them, when their only hope was to be\nleft to see and realize the full extent of their wrongs. But as they\neagerly accept the sympathy of unwise brethren, they receive the\nidea that they are abused; and if they attempt to retrace their steps,\nthey make halfhearted work. They divide the matter to suit their\nSlackness Reproved 207\nnatural feelings, lay blame upon the reprover, and so patch up the\nmatter. It is not probed to the bottom, and is not healed, and they\nagain fall into the same wrong, because they were not left to feel\nthe extent of their wrong, and humble themselves before God, and\nlet Him build them up. False sympathizers have worked in direct\nopposition to the mind of Christ and ministering angels.\nMinisters of Christ should arise and engage in the work of God\nwith all their energies. God\u2019s servants are not excused if they shun [214]\npointed testimony. They should reprove and rebuke wrong, and not\nsuffer sin upon a brother. I must here introduce a portion of a letter\naddressed to Brother C:\n\u201cI was shown some things in regard to you. I saw that the living,\npointed testimony had been crushed in the church. You have not\nbeen in harmony with the straight testimony. You have shunned to\nlay your hand decidedly upon wrong, and you have been tried with\nthose who felt compelled to do so. Disaffected ones have had your\nsympathy. This has had a tendency to make you a weak man. You\nhave not been in union with pointed, cutting testimony which has\nbeen sent home to the individual.\n\u201cGod\u2019s servants are not excused if they shun pointed testimony.\nThey must reprove and rebuke wrong, and not suffer sin upon a\nbrother. You have often stretched out your hands to shield persons\nfrom the censure which they deserved, and the correction which the\nLord designed they should have. If these persons fail to reform, their\nlack is set to your account. Instead of watching for their danger, and\nwarning them of it, you have cast your influence against those who\nhave followed the convictions of duty, and reproved and warned the\nerring.\n\u201cThese are perilous times for the church of God, and the great-\nest danger now is that of self-deception. Individuals professing to\nbelieve the truth are blind to their own danger and wrongs. They\nreach the standard of piety which has been set up by their friends and\nthemselves, they are fellowshiped by their brethren, and are satisfied,\nwhile they entirely fail to reach the gospel standard set up by our\ndivine Lord. If they regard iniquity in their hearts, the Lord will\nnot hear them. But with many it is not only regarded in the heart,\nbut openly carried out in the life; yet in many cases the wrongdoers\nreceive no rebuke.\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\n\u201cI was pointed back to -----. Your feelings were wrong there.\nYou should have stood side by side with Elder D and made straight[215]\nwork, taken hold of and reproved individual wrongs. The burden\nyou cast upon Elder D you deserved yourself, for your lack of moral\ncourage to lay your hand upon wrong. You influenced others. The\ngood work which God designed should be accomplished for certain\nones was not accomplished, and they have been puffed up by Satan.\nIf you had stood in the counsel of God at that time, an influence\nwould have been cast which would have told upon the cause of\nGod. The Spirit of the Lord was grieved. And this lack of union\ndiscourages those upon whom God lays the burden of reproof.\n\u201cI was shown that you had been wrong in sympathizing with\nE. The course you have taken in regard to him has injured your\ninfluence, and has greatly injured the cause of God. It is impossible\nfor E to be fellowshiped by the church of God. He has placed himself\nwhere he cannot be helped by the church, where he can have no\ncommunion with nor voice in the church. He has placed himself\nthere in the face of light and truth. He has stubbornly chosen his\nown course, and refused to listen to reproof. He has followed the\ninclinations of his corrupt heart, has violated the holy law of God,\nand has disgraced the cause of present truth. If he repents ever so\nheartily, the church must let his case alone. If he goes to heaven,\nit must be alone, without the fellowship of the church. A standing\nrebuke from God and the church must ever rest upon him, that the\nstandard of morality be not lowered to the very dust. The Lord is\ndispleased with your course in these things.\n\u201cYou have injured the cause of God; your willful course has\nwounded the hearts of God\u2019s people. Your influence encourages a\nslack state of things in the church. You should bear a living, pointed\ntestimony. Stand out of the way of the work of God, step not in\nbetween God and His people. You have too long wrapped up the\nsharp testimony, and stood opposed to the severe censure which God\nlays upon individual wrongs. God is correcting, and proving, and[216]\npurifying His people. Stand out of the way that His work be not\nhindered. He will not accept a smooth testimony. Ministers must cry\naloud, and spare not. The Lord has given you a powerful testimony,\ncalculated to strengthen the church and arouse unbelievers. But these\nthings wherein you lack must be corrected, or your testimony will\nSlackness Reproved 209\nbecome powerless, and your influence injure the cause of God. The\npeople look to you for an example. Do not mislead them. Let your\ninfluence be to correct wrongs in your family and in the church.\u201d\nI have been shown that the Lord is reviving the living, pointed\ntestimony, which will develop character and purify the church. But\nwhile we are commanded to separate from the world, it is not nec-\nessary that we become coarse and rough, and descend to common\nexpressions, and make our remarks as rude as possible. The truth is\ndesigned to elevate the receiver, to refine his taste and sanctify his\njudgment. There should be a continual effort to imitate the society\nwe expect soon to join; namely, angels of God who have never fallen\nby sin. The character should be holy, the manners comely, the words\nwithout guile, and thus should we follow on step by step until we\nare fitted for translation.\n* * * * *\nChapter 40\u2014Duty to Children\nI have been shown that parents generally have not taken a proper\ncourse with their children. They have not restrained them as they\nshould, but have left them to indulge in pride, and follow their own\ninclinations. Anciently, parental authority was regarded; children\nwere then in subjection to their parents, and feared and reverenced\nthem; but in these last days the order is reversed. Some parents are\nin subjection to their children. They fear to cross the will of their\nchildren, and therefore yield to them. But just as long as children are[217]\nunder the roof of the parents, dependent upon them, they should be\nsubject to their control. Parents should move with decision, requiring\nthat their views of right be followed out.\nEli might have restrained his wicked sons, but he feared their\ndispleasure. He suffered them to go on in their rebellion, until\nthey became a curse to Israel. Parents are required to restrain their\nchildren. The salvation of children depends very much upon the\ncourse pursued by the parents. In their mistaken love and fondness\nfor their children, many parents indulge them to their hurt, nourish\ntheir pride, and put upon them trimmings and ornaments which\nmake them vain, and lead them to think that dress makes the lady\nor gentleman. But a short acquaintance convinces those with whom\nthey associate that an outside appearance is not sufficient to hide\nthe deformity of a heart void of the Christian graces, but filled with\nself-love, haughtiness, and uncontrolled passions. Those who love\nmeekness, humility, and virtue, should shun such society, even if\nit be Sabbathkeepers\u2019 children. Their company is poisonous; their\ninfluence leads to death. Parents realize not the destructive influence\nof the seed which they are sowing. It will spring up and bear fruit\nwhich will make their children despise parental authority.\nEven after they are of age, children are required to respect their\nparents, and to look after their comfort. They should listen to the\ncounsel of godly parents, and not feel that because a few more years\nare added to their life, they have grown out of their duty to them.\n210\nDuty to Children 211\nThere is a commandment with promise to those who honor their\nfather and their mother. In these last days children are so noted for\ntheir disobedience and disrespect that God has especially noticed it,\nand it constitutes a sign that the end is near. It shows that Satan has\nalmost complete control of the minds of the young. By many, age\nis no more respected. It is considered too old-fashioned to respect [218]\nthe aged; it dates back as far as the days of Abraham. Says God:\n\u201cI know him, that he will command his children and his household\nafter him.\u201d\nAnciently, children were not permitted to marry without the\nconsent of their parents. Parents chose for their children. It was\nconsidered a crime for children to contract marriage upon their own\nresponsibility. The matter was first laid before the parents, and\nthey were to consider whether the person to be brought into a close\nrelation to them was worthy, and whether the parties could provide\nfor a family. It was considered by them of the greatest importance\nthat they, the worshipers of the true God, should not intermarry\nwith an idolatrous people, lest their families be led away from God.\nEven after children were married, they were under the most solemn\nobligation to their parents. Their judgment was not then considered\nsufficient without the counsel of the parents, and they were required\nto respect and obey their wishes unless these should conflict with\nthe requirements of God.\nAgain I was directed to the condition of the young in these last\ndays. Children are not controlled. Parents, you should commence\nyour first lesson of discipline when your children are babes in your\narms. Teach them to yield their will to yours. This can be done\nby bearing an even hand, and manifesting firmness. Parents should\nhave perfect control over their own spirits, and with mildness and\nyet firmness bend the will of the child until it shall expect nothing\nelse but to yield to their wishes.\nParents do not commence in season. The first manifestation\nof temper is not subdued, and the children grow stubborn, which\nincreases with their growth and strengthens with their strength. Some\nchildren, as they grow older, think it a matter of course that they\nmust have their own way, and that their parents must submit to\ntheir wishes. They expect their parents to wait upon them. They\nare impatient of restraint, and when old enough to be a help to\n212 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ntheir parents, they do not bear the burdens they should. They have[219]\nbeen released from responsibilities, and grow up worthless at home\nand worthless abroad. They have no power or endurance. The\nparents have borne the burden, and have suffered them to grow up\nin idleness, without habits of order, industry, or economy. They\nhave not been taught habits of self-denial, but have been petted and\nindulged, their appetites gratified, and they come up with enfeebled\nhealth. Their manners and deportment are not agreeable. They\nare unhappy themselves, and make those around them unhappy.\nAnd while the children are but children still, while they need to be\ndisciplined, they are allowed to go out in company and mingle with\nthe society of the young, and one has a corrupting influence over\nanother.\nThe curse of God will surely rest upon unfaithful parents. Not\nonly are they planting thorns which will wound them here, but they\nmust meet their own unfaithfulness when the judgment shall sit.\nMany children will rise up in judgment and condemn their parents\nfor not restraining them, and charge upon them their destruction.\nThe false sympathy and blind love of parents causes them to excuse\nthe faults of their children and pass them by without correction, and\ntheir children are lost in consequence, and the blood of their souls\nwill rest upon the unfaithful parents.\nChildren who are thus brought up undisciplined, have everything\nto learn when they profess to be Christ\u2019s followers. Their whole\nreligious experience is affected by their bringing up in childhood.\nThe same self-will often appears; there is the same lack of self-\ndenial, the same impatience under reproof, the same love of self\nand unwillingness to seek counsel of others, or to be influenced\nby others\u2019 judgment, the same indolence, shunning of burdens,\nlack of bearing responsibilities. All this is seen in their relation\nto the church. It is possible for such to overcome; but how hard\nthe battle! how severe the conflict! How hard to pass through the\ncourse of thorough discipline which is necessary for them to reach[220]\nthe elevation of Christian character! Yet if they overcome at last,\nthey will be permitted to see, before they are translated, how near\nthe precipice of eternal destruction they came, because of the lack of\nright training in youth, the failure to learn submission in childhood.\nDuty to Children 213\n* * * * *\nChapter 41\u2014Systematic Benevolence\nI was pointed back to the children of Israel anciently. God\nrequired of them all, both poor and rich, a sacrifice according as He\nhad prospered them. The poor were not excused because they had\nnot the wealth of their rich brethren. They were required to exercise\neconomy and self-denial. And if any were so poor that it was utterly\nimpossible for them to bring an offering to the Lord, if sickness or\nmisfortune had deprived them of the ability to bestow, those who\nwere wealthy were required to help them to a humble mite, that\nthey come not before the Lord empty-handed. This arrangement\npreserved a mutual interest.\nSome have not come up and united in the plan of systematic\nbenevolence, excusing themselves because they were not free from\ndebt. They plead that they must first \u201cowe no man anything.\u201d But\nthe fact that they are in debt does not excuse them. I saw that they\nshould render to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God\nthe things that are God\u2019s. Some feel conscientious to \u201cowe no man\nanything,\u201d and think that God can require nothing of them until their\ndebts are all paid. Here they deceive themselves. They fail to render\nto God the things that are His. Everyone must bring to the Lord a\nsuitable offering. Those who are in debt should take the amount\nof their debts from what they possess, and give a proportion of the\nremainder.\nSome have felt under sacred obligations to their children. They[221]\nmust give each a portion, but feel themselves unable to raise means\nto aid the cause of God. They make the excuse that they have a\nduty to their children. This may be right, but their first duty is to\nGod. Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God\nthe things that are God\u2019s. Rob not God by withholding from Him\nyour tithes and offerings. It is the first sacred duty to render to God\na suitable proportion. Let no one throw in his claims and lead you to\nrob God. Let not your children steal your offering from God\u2019s altar\nfor their own benefit.\n214\nSystematic Benevolence 215\nI saw that anciently the covetousness of some led them to with-\nhold a suitable proportion; they made their offering stinted. This\nwas recorded in heaven, and they were cursed in their harvest and\ntheir flocks just as they withheld. Some were visited with affliction\nin their families. God would not accept a lame offering. It must be\nwithout blemish, the best of their flocks, and the best fruits of their\nfields. And it must be a freewill offering, if they would have the\nblessing of the Lord rest upon their families and their possessions.\nThe case of Ananias and Sapphira was presented before me to\nillustrate the course of those who put down their property below its\nvalue. They pretended to make a freewill offering of their posses-\nsions to the Lord. Said Peter: \u201cTell me whether ye sold the land\nfor so much?\u201d The answer was: \u201cYea, for so much.\u201d Some in this\nevil age would not consider that a lie. But the Lord regarded it thus.\nThey had sold it for so much, and much more. They had professed\nto consecrate all to God. To Him they had dissembled, and their\nretribution lingered not.\nI saw that in the arrangement of systematic benevolence, hearts\nwill be tested and proved. It is a constant, living test. It brings\none to understand his own heart, to see whether the truth or the\nlove of the world predominates. Here is a test for the naturally\nselfish and covetous. They will put down their possessions at very\nlow figures. Here they dissemble. Said the angel: \u201cCursed be he [222]\nthat doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully.\u201d Angels are watching\nthe development of character, and the acts of such are carried to\nheaven by the heavenly messengers. Some will be visited of God\nfor these things, and their increase will be brought down to their\nfigures. \u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal\nsoul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also\nhimself.\u201d Proverbs 11:24, 25.\nAll are required to have an interest in this work. Those who\nuse tobacco, tea, and coffee should lay aside those idols, and put\ntheir cost into the treasury of the Lord. Some have never made a\nsacrifice for the cause of God, and are asleep as to what God requires\nof them. Some of the very poorest will have the greatest struggle to\ndeny themselves of these stimulants. This individual sacrifice is not\nrequired because the cause of God is suffering for means. But every\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nheart will be tested, every character developed. It is principle that\nGod\u2019s people must act upon. The living principle must be carried\nout in the life.\n\u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed Me. But ye say,\nWherein have we robbed Thee? In tithes and offerings. Ye are\ncursed with a curse: for ye have robbed Me, even this whole nation.\nBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in\nMine house, and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts,\nif I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a\nblessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. And I will\nrebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits\nof your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time\nin the field, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d I saw that this scripture has been\nmisapplied to speaking and praying in meeting. The prophecy has a\nspecial application to the last days, and teaches God\u2019s people their\nduty to bring a proportion of their substance as a freewill offering to\nthe Lord.\nChapter 42\u2014Our Denominational Name [223]\nI was shown in regard to the remnant people of God taking a\nname. Two classes were presented before me. One class embraced\nthe great bodies of professed Christians. They were trampling upon\nGod\u2019s law and bowing to a papal institution. They were keeping the\nfirst day of the week as the Sabbath of the Lord. The other class, who\nwere but few in number, were bowing to the great Lawgiver. They\nwere keeping the fourth commandment. The peculiar and prominent\nfeatures of their faith were the observance of the seventh day, and\nwaiting for the appearing of our Lord from heaven.\nThe conflict is between the requirements of God and the require-\nments of the beast. The first day, a papal institution which directly\ncontradicts the fourth commandment, is yet to be made a test by the\ntwo-horned beast. And then the fearful warning from God declares\nthe penalty of bowing to the beast and his image. They shall drink\nthe wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture\ninto the cup of His indignation.\nNo name which we can take will be appropriate but that which\naccords with our profession and expresses our faith and marks us\na peculiar people. The name Seventh-day Adventist is a standing\nrebuke to the Protestant world. Here is the line of distinction between\nthe worshipers of God and those who worship the beast and receive\nhis mark. The great conflict is between the commandments of God\nand the requirements of the beast. It is because the saints are keeping\nall ten of the commandments that the dragon makes war upon them.\nIf they will lower the standard and yield the peculiarities of their\nfaith, the dragon will be at peace; but they excite his ire because they\nhave dared to raise the standard and unfurl their banner in opposition\nto the Protestant world, who are worshiping the institution of papacy.\nThe name Seventh-day Adventist carries the true features of our [224]\nfaith in front, and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow\nfrom the Lord\u2019s quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God\u2019s law,\n217\n218 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand will lead to repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\nI was shown that almost every fanatic who has arisen, who\nwishes to hide his sentiments that he may lead away others, claims\nto belong to the church of God. Such a name would at once excite\nsuspicion; for it is employed to conceal the most absurd errors. This\nname is too indefinite for the remnant people of God. It would lead\nto the supposition that we had a faith which we wished to cover up.\n* * * * *\nChapter 43\u2014The Poor\nSome who are poor in this world\u2019s goods are apt to place all the\nstraight testimony upon the shoulders of the men of property. But\nthey do not realize that they also have a work to do. God requires\nthem to make a sacrifice. He calls upon them to sacrifice their\nidols. They should lay aside such hurtful stimulants as tobacco, tea,\nand coffee. If they are brought into straitened circumstances while\nexerting themselves to do the best they can, it will be a pleasure for\ntheir wealthy brethren to help them out of trouble.\nMany lack wise management and economy. They do not weigh\nmatters well, and move cautiously. Such should not trust to their\nown poor judgment, but should counsel with their brethren who\nhave experience. But those who lack economy and good judgment\nare often unwilling to seek counsel. They generally think that they\nunderstand how to conduct their temporal business, and are unwilling\nto follow advice. They make bad moves, and suffer in consequence.\nTheir brethren are grieved to see them suffer, and they help them [225]\nout of difficulty. Their unwise management affects the church. It\ntakes means from the treasury of God which should have been used\nto advance the cause of present truth. If these poor brethren take a\nhumble course and are willing to be advised and counseled by their\nbrethren, and are then brought into straitened places, the brethren\nshould feel it a duty to cheerfully help them out of difficulty. But\nif they choose their own course, and rely upon their own judgment,\nthey should be left to feel the full consequences of their unwise\ncourse, and learn by dear experience that \u201cin multitude of counselors\nthere is safety.\u201d God\u2019s people should be subject one to another. They\nshould counsel with one another, that the lack of one may be supplied\nby the sufficiency of another. I saw that the stewards of the Lord\nhave no duty to help those persons who persist in using tobacco, tea,\nand coffee.\n* * * * *\n219\nChapter 44\u2014Speculations\nI saw that some have excused themselves from aiding the cause\nof God because they were in debt. Had they closely examined their\nown hearts, they would have discovered that selfishness was the true\nreason why they brought no freewill offering to God. Some will\nalways remain in debt. Because of their covetousness, the prospering\nhand of God will not be with them to bless their undertakings. They\nlove this world better than they love the truth. They are not being\nfitted up and made ready for the kingdom of God.\nIf a new patent passes through the country, men who profess to\nbelieve the truth find a way to raise means to invest in the enterprise.\nGod is acquainted with every heart. Every selfish motive is known\nto Him, and He suffers circumstances to arise to try the hearts of\nHis professed people, to prove them and develop character. In some[226]\ninstances the Lord will suffer men to go on, and meet with an entire\nfailure. His hand is against them to disappoint their hopes and scatter\nwhat they possess. Those who really feel an interest in the cause of\nGod, and are willing to venture something for its advancement, will\nfind it a sure and safe investment. Some will have a hundredfold in\nthis life, and in the world to come life everlasting. But all will not\nreceive their hundredfold in this life, because they cannot bear it.\nIf entrusted with much, they would become unwise stewards. The\nLord withholds it for their good; but their treasure in heaven will be\nsecure. How much better is such an investment as this!\nThe desire that some of our brethren possess to earn means fast,\nleads them to engage in a new enterprise and invest means, but\noften their expectations of making money are not realized. They\nsink that which they could have spent in God\u2019s cause. There is an\ninfatuation in these new enterprises. And notwithstanding these\nthings have been acted over so many times, and they have before\nthem the example of others who have made investments and have\nmet with an utter failure, yet many are slow to learn. Satan allures\nthem on, and makes them drunk with anticipated gains. When their\n220\nSpeculations 221\nhopes are blasted, they suffer many discouragements in consequence\nof their unwise adventures. If means is lost, the person looks upon\nit as a misfortune to himself\u2014as his loss. But he must remember\nthat it is the means of another which he is handling, that he is only\na steward, and God is displeased with the unwise management of\nthat means which could have been used to advance the cause of\npresent truth. At the reckoning day the unfaithful steward must give\nan account of his stewardship.\nChapter 45\u2014A Dishonest Steward[227]\nI was shown that the Spirit of God has had less and less influence\nupon F, until he has no strength from God to overcome. Self and\nself-interest have been prominent with him for some length of time.\nPride of heart, a set, unsubdued will, and an unwillingness to confess\nand yield his wrongs, have brought him to the dreadful position he\nis in. Long has the cause been injured by his injudicious course.\nHe has been exacting, which has encouraged a spirit of faultfind-\ning in the church. He has been severe where it was uncalled for, and\nhas lorded it over those upon whom he dared to exercise authority.\nHis prayers and exhortations have led the brethren to think that he\nwas a devoted Christian, which has prepared them to be affected by\nhis wrong course. He has been notional, and his oddities have had a\nbad influence upon the minds of many. Some have been so weak as\nto imitate his example. I saw that he had done far greater injury than\ngood to the cause.\nHad he received the instruction given of God, and been corrected,\nhe would have obtained the victory over these strong habits and\nbesetments. But I saw that he had so long let these habits control\nhim that the strong foe has bound him. His deal has not been correct.\nDishonesty has been gaining upon him, and he has taken from\nthe treasury means that he had no right to, and has used it to his\nown advantage. He has considered that he had better judgment in\ndisposing of means than his brethren. When means was placed in his\nhands to be applied, and the giver named the individuals who were\nto receive it, he has acted from impulse, taken the liberty to apply it\nto suit himself, instead of carrying out the wishes of the giver, and\nhas used what portion of it he saw fit for his own benefit. God has\nfrowned upon these things. A dishonest course has been gaining\nupon him. He has considered that he was the Lord\u2019s steward, and[228]\ncould apply the means, even of another, as he saw fit. Every man is\nto be his own steward.\n222\nDishonest Steward 223\nHe has rejected the counsel and advice of his brethren, gone on\nin his own strength, followed his own will, and has rejected every\nmeans whereby he could be corrected. When he has been reproved,\nthe manner or the person has not suited him, and the way for reform\nhas been closed up. The Lord has not accepted his labors for some\nlength of time. He has labored much more for his own interest than\nfor the interest of the cause.\nWhen he first goes to a place, his prayers and exhortations have\neffect, and brethren receive the idea that he is a perfect Christian. He\nis favored because he is considered a minister. But as they become\nacquainted, how they are disappointed to witness his selfishness,\nfretfulness, harshness, and oddities. Almost every day some peculiar\nnotion is seen. His mind is almost constantly occupied in fixing\nup something for his own advantage. Then he will dispose of it to\nsomeone to good advantage to himself, and fix again. His fixing and\nplanning have had a withering, blighting influence upon the cause of\nGod. His course is calculated to tear to pieces, and it has wounded\nalmost everywhere. What an example to the flock! He has been very\nselfish in his deal, and has taken advantage of those with whom he\nhas dealt. God\u2019s frown is upon him. A good tree is known by its\nfruits.\n* * * * *\nChapter 46\u2014Fanaticism in Wisconsin\nI saw that the Lord especially directed my husband in going west\nlast fall instead of going east as he at first decided. In Wisconsin\nthere was a wrong to be corrected. The work of Satan was taking\neffect, and would destroy souls if not rebuked. The Lord saw fit to\nchoose one who had had experience with fanaticism in the past, and[229]\nhad witnessed the working of Satan\u2019s power. Those who received\nthis instrument of God\u2019s choosing were corrected, and souls were\nrescued from the snare which Satan had prepared for them.\nI was shown that this device of Satan would not have taken so\nreadily in Wisconsin if the minds and hearts of God\u2019s people had\nbeen united and in union with the work. The spirit of jealousy and\nsuspicion still existed in the minds of some. The seed sown by the\nMessenger party had not been entirely rooted out. And while they\nprofessed to receive the third angel\u2019s message, their former feelings\nand prejudices had not been given up. Their faith was adulterated,\nand they were prepared for Satan\u2019s deception. Those who drank in\nthe Messenger spirit must make clean work, and have every particle\nof it rooted out, and receive the spirit of the third angel\u2019s message,\nor it will cleave to them like the leprosy, making it easy for them to\ndraw off from their brethren in present truth. It will be easy for them\nto think that they can go, an independent company, alone to heaven,\nand easy for them to fall into Satan\u2019s snare. He is very unwilling to\nlet go his hold in Wisconsin. He has other deceptions prepared for\nthose who are not united with the body.\nI saw that persons who had been so enshrouded in darkness and\ndeception that Satan had controlled not only the mind but the body,\nwould have to take a most humble place in the church of God. He will\nnot commit the care of His flock to unwise shepherds, who would\nmistake and feed them poison instead of wholesome food. God will\nhave men care for the flock who can feed them with clean provender,\nthoroughly winnowed. Oh, what a blot, what a reproach, have these\nfanatical movements brought upon the cause of God! And those\n224\nFanaticism in Wisconsin 225\nwho held so fast to this spirit of dark fanaticism, notwithstanding\nthe plain evidences that it was from Satan, are not to be relied upon;\ntheir judgment is not to be considered of any weight. God sent His\nservants to Brother and Sister G. They despised correction, and [230]\nchose their own course. Brother G was jealous and stubborn, and his\nfuture course must be marked with great humility; for he has proved\nhimself unworthy of the confidence of God\u2019s people. His heart is\nnot right with God, neither has it been for a long time.\nI saw that Satan\u2019s object has been to lead persons in Wisconsin\ninto gross fanaticism. He has controlled their minds, and led them\nto act in accordance with the deception they were under. When his\nobject was accomplished, and they had run the length of the course\nwhich he had marked out for them, he was willing that they should\nacknowledge that wrong, and then he would try to push them to an\nopposite extreme, to deny the gifts and operations of God\u2019s Spirit.\nSatan took advantage of Brother and Sister G\u2019s lack of union with\nthe body. They desired to take an independent course, and to lead\ninstead of yielding to be led. Brother G has a jealous disposition,\nwhich, together with his independence, has kept him to one side; for\nwith this spirit he could not be a true yokefellow with his ministering\nbrethren. Sister G is of a jealous disposition, and possesses much\nfirmness. She lacks experience, and has not been sound in the faith\nor united with the body. Her heart has risen up against the gifts of the\nchurch. There was a lack of meekness and humility in her articles\nsent to the Review for publication.\nEverything seemed prepared for the work of Satan. He led\nmany on to lay aside reason and judgment, and to be governed by\nimpressions. The Lord requires His people to use their reason, and\nnot lay it aside for impressions. His work will be intelligible to all\nHis children. His teaching will be such as will commend itself to\nthe understanding of intelligent minds. It is calculated to elevate the\nmind. God\u2019s power is not manifested upon every occasion. Man\u2019s\nnecessity is God\u2019s opportunity.\nI was shown companies in confusion, exercised by a wrong spirit, [231]\nall making loud prayers together, some crying one thing and some\nanother; and it was impossible to tell what was piped and what was\nharped. \u201cGod is not the author of confusion, but of peace.\u201d Satan\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nstepped in and controlled matters as he pleased. Reason and health\nwere sacrificed to this delusion.\nGod does not require His people to imitate Baal\u2019s prophets, to\nafflict their bodies and cry out and shout, and throw themselves into\nalmost every attitude, having no regard for order, until their strength\nfails through sheer exhaustion. Religion does not consist in making\na noise; yet when the soul is filled with the Spirit of the Lord, sweet,\nheartfelt praise to God glorifies Him. Some have professed to have\ngreat faith in God, and to have special gifts and special answers\nto their prayers, although the evidence was lacking. They mistook\npresumption for faith. The prayer of faith is never lost; but to claim\nthat it will be always answered in the very way and for the particular\nthing we have expected, is presumption.\nWhen the servants of God visited ----- and -----, this delusion\nwas sifted. Evidence was given that this work was spurious. But the\nspirit of fanaticism was stubborn, and would not yield to the light\nthere given. Oh, that those who were in error had been corrected by\nGod\u2019s servants whom He sent to them! Then and there God wished\nthem to acknowledge that they had been led by a wrong spirit. Then\nthere would have been virtue in the confession of their wrongs. Then\nthey would have been saved any further following out of Satan\u2019s\nplans, and would have made no further progress in this dreadful\ndelusion. But they would not be convinced. Brother G had sufficient\nlight to take his stand against that fanatical work; but he would not\ndecide from the weight of evidence. His stubborn spirit refused to\nyield to the light brought him by the servants of God; for he had\nregarded them with suspicion, and watched them with a jealous eye.\nI saw that the greater the light which the people reject, the greater[232]\nwill be the power of deception and darkness which will come upon\nthem. The rejection of truth leaves men captives, the subjects of Sa-\ntan\u2019s deception. After the Conferences at ----- and -----, the subjects\nof this delusion were left to still greater darkness, to enter deeper into\nthis strong delusion, and bring upon the cause of God a stain which\nwould not soon be wiped away. A fearful responsibility is resting\nupon Brother G. While professing to be a shepherd he suffered the\ndevourer to enter the flock, and looked on while the sheep were torn\nand devoured. God\u2019s frown is upon him. He has not watched for\nsouls as one who must give account.\nFanaticism in Wisconsin 227\nI was pointed back, and saw that God had not blessed his labors\nfor some time past. The Lord\u2019s hand has not been with him to\nbuild up the church, and convert souls to the truth. His heart is not\nright with God. He has not possessed the spirit of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage. He shut himself away from union and sympathy with God\u2019s\npeople before this delusion arose, and this is one reason why he was\nleft in such darkness. God does not leave His faithful, consecrated\nservants in darkness as to the character of such a fanatical spirit,\nto raise no cry to warn the people. When the servants of God\nbrought the light, and raised their voices against this delusion, he\nknew not the voice of the True Shepherd speaking through them;\nhis jealousy and stubbornness led him to regard it as the voice of a\nstranger. Shepherds of the flock, above all others, should understand\nthe voice of the Chief Shepherd. God wants His people to be a\nholy and powerful people. When the spirit of holiness and perfect\nlove abounds in the heart, working in those who profess the name\nof Christ, it will be like a refining fire, consuming the dross and\nscattering the darkness. Whatever is of the spirit of Satan takes the\nattitude of defense, and quickly works out its own destruction. But\ntruth will triumph.\nChapter 47\u2014Concealing Reproofs[233]\nI was shown the course of H and I. Although reproved, they\nhave not corrected their wrongs. The people of God, especially in\nthe State of New York, have been affected by their wrong course.\nTheir influence has been injurious to the cause of God. For the last\nten years they have been often presented before me in vision, their\nwrongs have been shown me, and I have written to them concerning\nthese things. But they were careful to conceal from their brethren\nthe fact that they had been reproved, fearing it would have a ten-\ndency to destroy their influence. Those who were affected by their\nwrong course, should have been benefited by the reproofs which\nthey received. I should have placed these messages in the hands of\njudicious brethren in the church, that if necessary, all might under-\nstand the instruction the Lord saw fit to give His people. But when\nI related the messages given me for these brethren to anyone but\nthemselves, they censured me in the most unsparing manner. This\ncaused me so much suffering of mind that I have been led to conceal\nwhat the Lord has given me in regard to the wrongs of individuals.\nIt was pride of heart which led these brethren to manifest so\nmuch fear lest others should know that they had been corrected. If\nthey had humbly confessed their wrongs to the church, they would\nhave acted out the faith they professed to have in the visions, and\nthe church would have been strengthened to receive correction and\nconfess their faults. These teachers stood in the way of the flock.\nThey set them a wrong example, and the church have looked to them,\nand when reproved have inquired: \u201cWhy have not these ministers\nbeen reproved, when we are following their teachings?\u201d A door has\nthus been opened for Satan to tempt them as to the truthfulness of\nthe visions.\nThe brethren have been deceived and wronged. They believed\nthat we were in union with these teachers, and followed their instruc-[234]\ntions, when they were all wrong. I have written to these ministers\nin anguish of spirit as I have seen the cause of God wounded by\n228\nConcealing Reproofs 229\ntheir injudicious course. How anxiously have I watched the effect\nof these messages. But they laid them aside, and the brethren were\nnot permitted to know anything about them, therefore could not be\nbenefited by the instructions which the Lord saw fit to give.\nMy labor has been most discouraging, as I have seen that what\nGod designed has not been accomplished. Often I have inquired in\ndistress: Of what account is all my labor? These brethren took this\nposition: We believe the visions, but Sister White, in writing them,\nput in her own words, and we will believe that portion which we\nthink is of God, and will not heed the other. This course they have\npursued, and have not corrected their lives. They have professed to\nbelieve the visions, but have acted contrary to them. Their example\nand influence have raised doubts in the minds of others. It would\nhave been better for the cause of present truth had they both opposed\nthe gifts. Then the people would not have been deceived, and would\nnot have stumbled over these blind teachers. We have hoped and\nprayed that they might get right, and exert a good influence upon the\nflock; but hope has died, and we cannot, dare not, hold our peace\nlonger. We have wronged the church of God, in that we have not\nspoken out before.\n* * * * *\nChapter 48\u2014The Cause in Ohio\nSince our visit to Ohio in the spring of 1858, H has done what\nhe could to exert an influence against us; and where he thought\nhe could affect individuals, he has done so by circulating reports\nto stir up wrong feelings. When we visited Ohio in the spring of\n1858, a message was given me in regard to him and his family. This[235]\ntestimony was given to him. But very few persons knew that I had\na message for him. He rose in rebellion against it, and, like some\nothers who have been reproved, took the position that persons had\nprejudiced my mind against his family, when the vision pointed out\nthe same faults in them that I had repeatedly seen for ten years. He\nsaid that he believed the visions, but that I was influenced by others\nin writing them.\nWhat a conclusion! The Lord has a special work to perform\nthrough one of the acknowledged gifts, but suffers the message\ngiven to be adulterated before it reaches the person whom He wishes\nto correct! Of what use are the visions if persons regard them in\nthis light? They put their own construction upon them, and feel at\nliberty to reject that portion which does not agree with their feelings.\nH knows that every word of the vision given for him in Ohio was\ncorrect. And when he could keep the message from the church no\nlonger (for it was called for, and read at the _____ Conference last\nfall), he acknowledged it all true. But he has kept up a blind warfare\nagainst that which he knew to be correct.\nHe has not ruled well his own house, and for the last ten years has\nbeen reproved for this. The frown of God has been upon him because\nhe did not restrain his children. These children have been corrupt\nand a proverb of reproach, and have exerted a corrupting influence\nwhere they have lived. Every time they have been presented before\nme, I have been carried back to Eli, and shown the wickedness of\nhis ungodly sons and the judgment which followed from God. I\nhave been shown that the family of H has disgusted unbelievers, and\nbrought a reproach upon the cause of present truth. The message\n230\nCause in Ohio 231\ngiven me in the spring of 1858 for Ohio, especially -----, was not\nreceived by many. It cut too close, and the hearts that were not\ndeeply imbued with the spirit of the truth, rebelled against it.\nThe ministers who have labored in that State have not exerted [236]\na right influence. Hints and insinuations have been thrown out\nagainst Brother and Sister White, and the managers of the work at\nBattle Creek, which have found a ready reception in the hearts of\nmany, especially the credulous and faultfinding. Satan knows how\nto make his attacks. He works upon minds to excite jealousy and\ndissatisfaction toward those at the head of the work. The gifts are\nnext questioned; then, of course, they have but little weight, and\ninstruction given through vision is disregarded.\nMinisters who have labored in Ohio have done their share of\ncausing dissatisfaction. H has condescended to move in a low sphere,\nbreathing out a spirit of dissatisfaction, eagerly listening to false\nreports, gathering them up, and virtually saying: \u201cReport, ... and\nwe will report it.\u201d He has worked in an underhand manner, carried\nfalse reports in regard to our dress, and our influence in Ohio, and\nhas encouraged the idea that Brother White was speculating. He has\nnot had the slightest union with us. He has felt very bitter toward\nus. And why? Simply because I have related to him what the Lord\nhad shown me in regard to his family and his loose, slack manner of\nbringing them up, which has brought upon him the frown of God.\nHe has regarded with jealous, unreconciled feelings the part we have\nacted in the cause of present truth.\nThe brethren in Ohio have been encouraged to look with distrust\nand suspicion at those who are in charge of the work at Battle Creek,\nand have stood prepared to rise against positions taken by them.\nBrother J has taken his position firmly, without regard to the body.\nHe has imagined that evils would arise from headquarters that he\nmust contend against. He placed himself in array for battle when\nthere was no fighting to be done. He planted himself firmly to\nresist something which never arose. Many of the brethren in Ohio\ncherished the same feeling, placing themselves in opposition to [237]\nsomething that never appeared. Their warfare has been unwise.\nThey have been ready to cry out, Babylon, until they are a complete\nBabylon themselves.\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nMinisters have stood directly in the way of the work of God in\nOhio. They should stand out of the way, that God may reach His\npeople. They step in between God and His people, and turn aside\nHis purposes. Brother J has exerted an influence in Ohio which he\nmust labor to counteract. I saw that there were those in Ohio who\nwould take the right position with right instructions. They have been\nwilling to sustain the cause of present truth, but have seen so little\naccomplished that they have become discouraged. Their hands are\nfeeble, and need staying up. I saw that the cause of God is not to\nbe carried forward by pressed offerings. God does not accept such\nofferings. This matter is to be left wholly to the people. They are\nnot to bring a yearly gift merely, but should also freely present a\nweekly and monthly offering before the Lord. This work is left to\nthe people, for it is to be to them a weekly, monthly, living test. This\ntithing system, I saw, would develop character, and manifest the true\nstate of the heart. If the brethren in Ohio have this matter presented\nbefore them in its true bearing, and are left to decide for themselves,\nthey will see wisdom and order in the tithing system.\nMinisters should not be severe, and draw upon any one man, and\npress means from him. If he does not give just as much as another\nthinks he should, they are not to denounce him, and throw him\noverboard. They should be as patient and forbearing as the angels\nare. They should work in union with Jesus. Christ and angels are\nwatching the development of character, and weighing moral worth.\nThe Lord bears long with His erring people. The truth will be brought\nto bear closer and closer, and will cut off one idol after another, until\nGod reigns supreme in the hearts of His consecrated people. I saw\nthat God\u2019s people must bring to Him a freewill offering; and the[238]\nresponsibility should be left wholly upon the individual, whether\nhe will give much or little. It will be faithfully recorded. Give the\npeople of God time to develop character.\nMinisters of God should bear the pointed testimony. The living\ntruths of His word should be brought to bear upon the heart. And\nwhen the people in Ohio have a worthy object placed before them,\nthose whose hearts are in sympathy with the work will freely impart\nof their means to advance the cause of God. The Lord is testing and\nproving His people. If any have no heart in the work, and fail to bring\ntheir offerings to God, He will visit them; and if they continue to\nCause in Ohio 233\ncling to their covetousness, He will separate them from His people.\nI saw that there must be a system which will draw upon all. Young\nmen and young women who have health and strength, have felt but\nlittle burden of the work. They are accountable to God for their\nstrength, and should bring a freewill offering to the Lord. And if\nthey will not do this, His prospering hand will be removed from\nthem.\nI saw that the special hand of God has not been with the work\nin Ohio to prosper the cause there. There is a lack; there should be\namong preachers and people a close examination, a faithful search-\ning of heart, to find the cause of so great a lack of the Spirit of God.\nTheir sacrifices and offerings have nearly dried up. Why do not\nthe truths of God\u2019s word warm the heart and lead to self-denial and\nsacrifice? Let the ministers search and see what kind of an influence\nthey have exerted. There has been with Brother J an independent\nspirit that God does not approve. His influence has not told for the\nunion of God\u2019s people or the advancement of the cause.\nI have seen that those who have had but a few years\u2019 experience\nin the cause of present truth, are not the ones to lead out in the\nwork. Such should manifest a delicacy in taking positions which [239]\nwill conflict with the judgment and opinion of those who witnessed\nthe rise of the cause of present truth, and whose lives are interwoven\nwith its progress. God will not select men of but little experience\nto lead out in this work. He will not choose those who have had\nno experience in the sufferings, trials, opposition, and privation\nendured to bring this work up to the platform on which it now rests.\nIt is now easy, compared with what it once was, to preach the third\nangel\u2019s message. Those who now engage in this work, and teach the\ntruth to others, have things made ready at their hand. They cannot\nexperience such privations as laborers in present truth have endured\nbefore them. The truth is brought out for them. Arguments are all\nprepared. Such should be careful how they become exalted, lest\nthey be overthrown. They should be very careful how they murmur\nagainst those who endured so much in the very commencement of\nthe work.\nThose experienced laborers who toiled under the burden when\nit was heavy and there were few to help bear it, God regards. Be\ncareful how you reproach them, or murmur against them; for it will\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nsurely stand to your account, and the prospering hand of God will\nnot be with you. Some brethren who have the least experience, who\nhave felt no burden, and have done little or nothing to advance the\ncause of present truth, and who have no knowledge of matters at\nBattle Creek, are the first to find fault with the management of the\nwork there. And those who do not observe order in their temporal\nconcerns, and command their households after them, are the ones\nwho oppose system, which will ensure order in the church of God.\nThey exhibit no nice taste in worldly matters, and are opposed to\nanything of the kind in the church. Such persons should have no\nvoice in matters of the church. Their influence should not have the\nleast weight upon others.\nChapter 49\u2014Entire Consecration [240]\nDear Brother and Sister K,\nIn my last vision I was shown some things in regard to your\nfamily. The Lord has thoughts of mercy concerning you and will\nnot forsake you unless you forsake Him. L and M are in a lukewarm\ncondition. They must arouse and make efforts for salvation, or they\nwill fail of everlasting life. They must feel an individual respon-\nsibility and have an experience for themselves. They need a work\nwrought in their hearts by the Holy Spirit of God, which will lead\nthem to love and choose the society of God\u2019s people above any other,\nand to be separate from those who have no love for spiritual things.\nJesus demands a whole sacrifice, an entire consecration. L and M,\nyou have not realized that God requires your undivided affections.\nYou have made a holy profession, yet have sunk down to the dead\nlevel of ordinary professors. You love the society of the young who\nhave no regard for the sacred truths which you profess. You have\nappeared like your associates, and have been contented with as much\nreligion as would render you agreeable to all, without incurring the\ncensure of any.\nChrist demands all. If He required less, His sacrifice was too\ndear, too great to make to bring us up to such a level. Our holy faith\ncries out, Separation. We should not be conformed to the world, or\nto dead, heartless professors. \u201cBe ye transformed by the renewing\nof your mind.\u201d This is a self-denying way. And when you think\nthat the way is too strait, that there is too much self-denial in this\nnarrow path; when you say, How hard to give up all, ask yourselves\nthe question, What did Christ give up for me? This question puts\nanything that we may call self-denial in the shade. Behold Him in\nthe garden, sweating great drops of blood. A solitary angel is sent\nfrom heaven to strengthen the Son of God. Follow Him on His way\nto the judgment hall, while He is derided, mocked, and insulted by\nthat infuriated mob. Behold Him clothed in that old purple kingly [241]\nrobe. Hear the coarse jest and cruel mocking. See them place upon\n235\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthat noble brow the crown of thorns, and then smite Him with a reed,\ncausing the thorns to penetrate His temples, and the blood to flow\nfrom that holy brow. Hear that murderous throng eagerly crying for\nthe blood of the Son of God. He is delivered into their hands, and\nthey lead the noble sufferer away, pale, weak, and fainting, to His\ncrucifixion. He is stretched upon the wooden cross, and the nails\nare driven through His tender hands and feet. Behold Him hanging\nupon the cross those dreadful hours of agony until the angels veil\ntheir faces from the horrid scene, and the sun hides its light, refusing\nto behold. Think of these things, and then ask, Is the way too strait?\nNo, no.\nIn a divided, halfhearted life, you will find doubt and darkness.\nYou cannot enjoy the consolations of religion, neither the peace\nwhich the world gives. Do not sit down in Satan\u2019s easy chair of\ndo-little, but arise, and aim at the elevated standard which it is your\nprivilege to attain. It is a blessed privilege to give up all for Christ.\nLook not at the lives of others and imitate them and rise no higher.\nYou have only one true, unerring Pattern. It is safe to follow Jesus\nonly. Determine that if others act on the principle of the spiritual\nsluggard you will leave them and march forward toward the elevation\nof Christian character. Form a character for heaven. Sleep not at\nyour post. Deal faithfully and truly with your own soul.\nYou are indulging an evil which threatens to destroy your spiritu-\nality. It will eclipse all the beauty and interest of the sacred pages. It\nis love for storybooks, tales, and other reading which does not have\nan influence for good upon the mind that is in any way dedicated to\nthe service of God. It produces a false, unhealthy excitement, fevers\nthe imagination, unfits the mind for usefulness, and disqualifies it\nfor any spiritual exercise. It weans the soul from prayer and love[242]\nof spiritual things. Reading that will throw light upon the sacred\nvolume, and quicken your desire and diligence to study it, is not\ndangerous, but beneficial. You were represented to me with your\neyes turned from the Sacred Book and intently fixed upon exciting\nbooks, which are death to religion. The oftener and more diligently\nyou peruse the Scriptures, the more beautiful will they appear, and\nthe less relish will you have for light reading. The daily study of the\nScriptures will have a sanctifying influence upon the mind. You will\nEntire Consecration 237\nbreathe a heavenly atmosphere. Bind this precious volume to your\nhearts. It will prove to you a friend and guide in perplexity.\nYou have had objects in view in your life, and how steadily\nand perseveringly have you labored to attain those objects! You\nhave calculated and planned until your anticipations were realized.\nThere is an object before you now worthy of a persevering, untiring,\nlifelong effort. It is the salvation of your soul\u2014everlasting life. And\nthis demands self-denial, sacrifice, and close study. You must be\npurified and refined. You lack the saving influence of the Spirit\nof God. You mingle with your associates and forget that you have\nnamed the name of Christ. You act and dress like them.\nSister K, I saw that you have a work to do. You must die to\npride and let your whole interest be in the truth. Your eternal interest\ndepends upon the course you now pursue. If you obtain eternal life,\nyou must live for it and deny self. Come out from the world, and\nbe separate. Your life must be marked with sobriety, watchfulness,\nand prayer. Angels are watching the development of character and\nweighing moral worth. All our words and acts are passing in review\nbefore God. It is a fearful, solemn time. The hope of eternal life is\nnot to be taken up upon slight grounds; it must be settled between\nGod and your own soul. Some will lean upon others\u2019 judgment\nand experience rather than be at the trouble of a close examination [243]\nof their own hearts, and will pass along for months and years with\nno witness of the Spirit of God, or evidence of their acceptance.\nThey deceive themselves. They have a supposed hope, but lack\nthe essential qualifications of a Christian. First there must be a\nthorough heart work, then their manners will take that elevated,\nnoble character which marks the true followers of Christ. It requires\neffort and moral courage to live out our faith.\nGod\u2019s people are peculiar. Their spirit cannot mingle with the\nspirit and influence of the world. You do not wish to bear the Chris-\ntian name and yet be unworthy of it. You do not desire to meet\nJesus with a profession only. You do not wish to be deceived in so\nimportant a matter. Thoroughly examine the grounds of your hope.\nDeal truly with your own soul. A supposed hope will never save\nyou. Have you counted the cost? I fear not. Now decide whether\nyou will follow Christ, cost what it will. You cannot do this and yet\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nenjoy the society of those who pay no heed to divine things. Your\nspirits cannot mingle any more than oil and water.\nIt is a great thing to be a child of God, and a joint-heir with\nChrist. If this is your privilege, you will know the fellowship of\nChrist\u2019s sufferings. God looketh upon the heart. I saw that you must\nseek Him earnestly, and raise your standard of piety higher, or you\nwill certainly fail of everlasting life. You may ask the question: Did\nSister White see this? Yes; and I have tried to place it before you\nand give you the impressions which were given me. May the Lord\nhelp you to take heed.\nDear brother and sister, watch your children with jealous care.\nThe spirit and influence of the world are destroying all desire in\nthem to be true Christians. Let your influence be to draw them from\nyoung companions who have no interest in divine things. They must\nmake a sacrifice if they win heaven at last.\nChapter 50\u2014Personal Experience [244]\nSeptember 20, 1860, my fourth child, John Herbert White, was\nborn. When he was three weeks old, my husband felt it to be\nhis duty to travel. It was decided at the Conference that Brother\nLoughborough should go west and he go east. A few days before\nthey were to leave, my husband was greatly depressed in mind. At\none time he thought he would give up the journey, yet he feared\nto do so. He felt that he had something to do, but was shut in by\nclouds of darkness. He could not rest or sleep. His mind was in\ncontinual agitation. He related the state of his mind to Brethren\nLoughborough and Cornell, and bowed before the Lord with them\nto seek counsel of Him. Then the clouds parted, and the clear light\nshone. My husband felt that the Spirit of the Lord was directing him\nwest and Brother Loughborough east. After this they felt clear as to\ntheir duty and moved accordingly.\nIn my husband\u2019s absence we prayed that the Lord would sustain\nand strengthen him, and obtained the assurance that He would go\nwith him. About one week before he was to visit Mauston, Wiscon-\nsin, we received letters for publication from Sister G purporting to be\nvisions given her of the Lord. As we read these communications, we\nfelt distressed; for we knew that they were not from the right source.\nAnd as my husband knew nothing of what he was about to meet at\nMauston, we feared he would be unprepared to meet the fanaticism,\nand that it would have a discouraging influence upon his mind. We\nhad passed through so many such scenes in our early experience,\nand had suffered so much from unruly, untamable spirits, that we\ndreaded to be brought in contact with them. I sent in a request for\nthe church at Battle Creek to pray for my husband, and at our family\naltar we earnestly sought the Lord in his behalf. With brokenness of\nspirit, and many tears, we tried to fasten our trembling faith upon [245]\nGod\u2019s promises, and we had the evidence that He heard us pray and\nthat He would stand by my husband and impart to him counsel and\nwisdom.\n239\n240 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWhile looking in the Bible for a verse for Willie to commit to\nmemory to repeat in the Sabbath school, this scripture arrested my\nattention: \u201cThe Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and\nHe knoweth them that trust in Him.\u201d I could but weep over these\nwords, they seemed so appropriate. The whole burden upon my\nmind was for my husband and the church in Wisconsin. My husband\ndid realize the blessing of God while in Wisconsin. The Lord was to\nhim a stronghold in time of trouble and sustained him by His free\nSpirit while he bore a decided testimony against the wild fanaticism\nthere.\nWhile at Mackford, Wisconsin, my husband wrote me a letter in\nwhich he stated: \u201cI fear that all is not well at home. I have had some\nimpressions as to the babe.\u201d While praying for the family at home,\nhe had a presentiment that the child was very sick. The babe seemed\nlying before him with face and head dreadfully swollen. When\nI received the letter, the child was as well as usual; but the next\nmorning he was taken very sick. It was an extreme case of erysipelas\nin the face and head. When my husband reached Brother Wick\u2019s,\nnear Round Grove, Illinois, he received a telegram informing him of\nthe sickness of the child. After reading it, he stated to those present\nthat he was not surprised at the news, for the Lord had prepared his\nmind for it, and that they would hear that the child\u2019s head and face\nwere greatly affected.\nMy dear babe was a great sufferer. Twenty-four days and nights\nwe anxiously watched over him, using all the means that we could\nfor his recovery and earnestly presenting his case to the Lord. At\ntimes I could not control my feelings as I witnessed his sufferings.\nMuch of my time was spent in tears and humble supplication to God.\nBut our heavenly Father saw fit to remove the loved one.\nDecember 14 he was taken worse, and I was called up. As I[246]\nlistened to his labored breathing and felt his pulseless wrist, I knew\nthat he must die. The icy hand of death was already upon him. That\nwas an hour of anguish for me. We watched his feeble, gasping\nbreath until it ceased, and could but feel thankful that his sufferings\nwere ended. When my child was dying, I could not weep. My\nheart ached as though it would break, but I could not shed a tear. At\nthe funeral I fainted. We were disappointed in not having Brother\nLoughborough to conduct the funeral services, and my husband\nPersonal Experience 241\nspoke upon the occasion to a crowded house. We then followed our\nchild to Oak Hill Cemetery, there to rest until the Life-giver shall\ncome, to break the fetters of the tomb and call him forth immortal.\nAfter we returned from the funeral, my home seemed lonely.\nI felt reconciled to the will of God, yet despondency and gloom\nsettled upon me. We could not rise above the discouragements of\nthe past summer. From the state of God\u2019s people we knew not what\nto expect. Satan had gained control of the minds of some who were\nclosely connected with us in the work, even of some who had been\nacquainted with our mission and seen the fruit of our labors, and who\nhad not only witnessed the frequent manifestation of the power of\nGod, but had felt its influence upon their own bodies. What could we\nhope for in the future? While my child lived, I thought I understood\nmy duty. I pressed my dear babe to my heart and rejoiced that at least\nfor one winter I should be released from any great responsibility, for\nit could not be my duty to travel in winter with my infant. But when\nhe was taken from me, I was again thrown into great perplexity.\nThe condition of God\u2019s cause and people nearly crushed us. Our\nhappiness ever depends upon the state of the cause of God. When\nHis people are in a prosperous condition, we feel free; but when they\nare backslidden and there is discord among them, nothing can make [247]\nus joyful. Our whole interest and life have been interwoven with the\nrise and progress of the third angel\u2019s message. We are bound up in\nit, and when it does not prosper, we experience great suffering of\nmind.\nAbout this time, my husband, as he reviewed the past, began to\nlose confidence in almost everyone. Many of those whom he had\ntried to befriend had acted the part of enemies, and some whom he\nhad helped the most by his influence and from his own scanty purse,\nwere continually trying to injure him and cast burdens upon him.\nOne Sabbath morning, as he was going to our place of worship, such\nan overpowering sense of injustice came over him that he turned\naside and wept aloud, while the congregation waited for him.\nFrom the commencement of our labors we have been called to\nbear a plain, pointed testimony, to reprove wrongs and spare not.\nAnd all the way there have been those who have stood in opposition\nto our testimony, and have followed after to speak smooth things,\ndaub with untempered mortar, and destroy the influence of our labors.\n242 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThe Lord would rein us up to bear reproof, and then individuals\nwould step right in between us and the people to make our testimony\nof no effect. Many visions have been given to the effect that we\nmust not shun to declare the counsel of the Lord, but must occupy a\nposition to stir up the people of God, for they are asleep in their sins.\nBut few have sympathized with us, while many have sympathized\nwith the wrong and with those who have been reproved. These\nthings crushed us, and we felt that we had no testimony to bear in\nthe church. We knew not in whom to confide. As all these things\nforced themselves upon us, hope died within us. We retired to rest\nabout midnight, but I could not sleep. A severe pain was in my heart;\nI could find no relief and fainted a number of times.\nMy husband sent for Brethren Amadon, Kellogg, and C. Smith.[248]\nTheir fervent prayers were heard, relief came, and I was taken off\nin vision. Then I was shown that we had a work to do, that we\nmust still bear our testimony, straight and pointed. Individuals were\npresented before me who had shunned the pointed testimony. I saw\nthe influence of their teachings upon God\u2019s people.\nThe condition of the people in ----- was also presented before me.\nThey have the theory of truth, but are not sanctified through it. I saw\nthat when the messengers enter a new place, their labor is worse than\nlost unless they bear a plain, pointed testimony. They should keep\nup the distinction between the church of Christ, and formal, dead\nprofessors. There was a failure in this respect in -----. Elder N was\nfearful of offending, fearful lest the peculiarities of our faith should\nappear; the standard was lowered to meet the people. It should have\nbeen urged upon them that we possess truths of vital importance,\nand that their eternal interest depended upon the decision they there\nmade; that in order to be sanctified through the truth, their idols\nwould have to be given up, their sins be confessed, and they bring\nforth fruit meet for repentance.\nThose who engage in the solemn work of bearing the third an-\ngel\u2019s message must move out decidedly, and in the Spirit and power\nof God fearlessly preach the truth and let it cut. They should elevate\nthe standard of truth and urge the people to come up to it. It has\ntoo frequently been lowered to meet the people in their condition of\ndarkness and sin. It is the pointed testimony that will bring them up\nto decide. A peaceful testimony will not do this. The people have the\nPersonal Experience 243\nprivilege of listening to this kind of teaching from popular pulpits;\nbut those servants to whom God has entrusted the solemn, fearful\nmessage which is to bring out and fit up a people for the coming of\nChrist should bear a plain, pointed testimony. Our truth is as much\nmore solemn than that of nominal professors, as the heavens are [249]\nhigher than the earth.\nThe people are asleep in their sins and need to be alarmed before\nthey can shake off this lethargy. Their ministers have preached\nsmooth things; but God\u2019s servants, who bear sacred, vital truths,\nshould cry aloud and spare not, that the truth may tear off the garment\nof security and find its way to the heart. The straight testimony that\nshould have been given to the people in ----- was shunned by the\nministers; the seed of truth was sown among thorns and has been\nchoked by them. With some, evil besetments have flourished, and\nthe heavenly graces have died out.\nGod\u2019s servants must bear a pointed testimony, which will cut\nthe natural heart and develop character. Brethren N and O moved\nwith a perfect restraint upon them while in -----. Such preaching\nas was given there will never do the work that God designs should\nbe accomplished. Ministers of the nominal churches do enough\ncringing, and wrapping up of the pointed truths which rebuke sin.\nUnless persons embrace the message aright, and their hearts are\nprepared to receive it, they would better let it entirely alone. I was\nshown that the church in ----- have an experience to obtain; but it\nwill be much harder for them to obtain it now than if the pointed\ntestimony had been given them at the very commencement, when\nthey first discovered that they were in error. Then the thorns could\nhave been more easily rooted out. Yet I saw that there were men of\nmoral worth in -----, some who will yet be tested upon present truth.\nIf the church will arise and be converted, the Lord will return unto\nthem and give them His Spirit. Then their influence will tell for the\ntruth.\nChapter 51\u2014The Cause in the West[250]\nI have seen that men of worth have embraced the truth West\nwho will yet be pillars to the cause. When they can place their\ntemporal affairs in a condition where they can use a portion of their\nmeans, they will do their part toward sustaining the cause. I also\nsaw that some were willing to receive the truth, brought to them by\nthe liberalities of their Eastern brethren, without its costing them\nanything. The brethren West should arouse and meet the expenses\nof their own states. God requires this at their hands, and they should\nfeel it a privilege to do so. The Lord will prove them, He will try\nthem to see if they will withdraw their affections from the world and\nmake their faith perfect by works.\nI saw that God\u2019s hand was stretched out to gather in souls in\nthe West. He has been bringing out men who can teach the truth\nto others, whose duty it will be to bear the message into new fields.\nI saw that if the men who have moved from the East to the West\nand have endured the hardships of settling in a new country, receive\npresent truth understandingly, they will manifest a perseverance and\ndecision of character in regard to the truth, similar to that manifested\nin securing to themselves temporal possessions, and will engage as\nheartily in the work of advancing the truth. If this corresponding zeal\nis lacking, the truth has not yet had its saving, sanctifying influence\nupon them.\nI was pointed back to a meeting in -----. Brother P felt the burden\nof the cause, but R had a spirit of opposition. His testimony was\nnot in union with the work of God, and he brought grief and burden\nupon those who were laboring for its advancement. But it would\nhave been better for the cause had he been suffered a time longer,\nand the brethren borne the confusion he caused. I saw that Brother\nP moved unwisely in his case. It gave R and the enemies of our\nfaith the advantage. Brother P should have waited until R\u2019s religious[251]\ncharacter was more fully developed. He would soon either have\nunited with the remnant people of God or been left one side. But R\n244\nCause in the West 245\nobtained sympathy on account of his age. He had partaken of the\nspirit of the Messenger party, and his whole course was darkened by\nit. His wife has an excitable, bitter spirit, and has been zealous to\nspread false reports. She acts the part to her husband that Jezebel\ndid to Ahab, and stirs him up to fight against the servants of God,\nwho bear a pointed testimony.\nTheir influence East has been decidedly against the spirit of\nthe truth and those who have devoted their lives to labor for its\nadvancement. There is a class East who profess to believe the truth,\nbut who cherish secret feelings of dissatisfaction against those who\nbear the burden in this work. The true sentiments of such do not\nappear until some influence opposed to the work of God arises, and\nthen they manifest their true character. Such readily receive, cherish,\nand circulate reports which have no foundation in truth, to destroy\nthe influence of those who are engaged in this work. All who wish to\ndraw off from the body will have opportunity. Something will arise\nto test everyone. The great sifting time is just before us. The jealous\nand the faultfinding, who are watching for evil, will be shaken out.\nThey hate reproof and despise correction. Those who love the spirit\nof the third angel\u2019s message can have no union with the spirit of R\nand his wife.\n* * * * *\nChapter 52\u2014A Question Answered\nThe question is often asked by those who fall under the influence\nof my enemies: \u201cIs Sister White getting proud? I have heard that\nshe wore a bonnet filled with bows and ribbons.\u201d\nI hope I am not getting proud. My manner of dress is the same as[252]\nit has been for several years. I am opposed to hoops and to wearing\nunnecessary bows and ribbons. I have worn one velvet bonnet two\nyears without change of strings except to cleanse them with soap\nand water. I put the same velvet upon a new frame and am wearing it\nagain this winter. I believe Sabbathkeepers should dress plainly and\nstudy economy in dress. Those who wish to talk will talk though we\ngive them no occasion. I do not expect to suit every taste in regard\nto dress, but I believe it to be my duty to wear durable clothing, to\ndress neatly and orderly, and suit my own taste if it does not disagree\nwith the word of God.\n246\nNumber Seven\u2014Testimony for the Church [253]\nChapter 53\u2014The North and the South\nJanuary 4, 1862, I was shown some things in regard to our\nnation. My attention was called to the Southern rebellion. The\nSouth had prepared themselves for a fierce conflict, while the North\nwere asleep as to their true feelings. Before President Lincoln\u2019s\nadministration commenced, great advantage was taken by the South.\nThe former administration planned and managed for the South to\nrob the North of their implements of war. They had two objects for\nso doing: 1. They were contemplating a determined rebellion, and\nmust prepare for it; 2. When they should rebel, the North would be\nwholly unprepared. They would thus gain time, and by their violent\nthreats and ruthless course they thought they could so intimidate the\nNorth that they would be obliged to yield to them and let them have\neverything their own way.\nThe North did not understand the bitter, dreadful hatred of the\nSouth toward them, and were unprepared for their deep-laid plots.\nThe North had boasted of their strength and ridiculed the idea of the\nSouth leaving the Union. They considered it like the threats of a\nwillful, stubborn child, and thought that the South would soon come\nto their senses, and, becoming sick of leaving the Union, would with\nhumble apologies return to their allegiance. The North have had[254]\nno just idea of the strength of the accursed system of slavery. It is\nthis, and this alone, which lies at the foundation of the war. The\nSouth have been more and more exacting. They consider it perfectly\nright to engage in human traffic, to deal in slaves and the souls of\nmen. They are annoyed and become perfectly exasperated if they\ncannot claim all the territory they desire. They would tear down\nthe boundaries and bring their slaves to any spot they please, and\ncurse the soil with slave labor. The language of the South has been\nimperious, and the North have not taken suitable measures to silence\nit.\nThe rebellion was handled so carefully, so slowly, that many who\nat first started with horror at the thought of rebellion were influenced\n248\nNorth and the South 249\nby rebels to look upon it as right and just, and thousands joined\nthe Southern Confederacy who would not had prompt and thorough\nmeasures been carried out by our Government at an early period of\nthe rebellion, even as ill-prepared as it then was for war. The North\nhave been preparing for war ever since, but the rebellion has been\nsteadily increasing, and there is now no better prospect of its being\nsubdued than there was months ago. Thousands have lost their lives,\nand many have returned to their homes, maimed and crippled for life,\ntheir health gone, their earthly prospects forever blighted; and yet\nhow little has been gained! Thousands have been induced to enlist\nwith the understanding that this war was to exterminate slavery; but\nnow that they are fixed, they find that they have been deceived, that\nthe object of this war is not to abolish slavery, but to preserve it as it\nis.\nThose who have ventured to leave their homes and sacrifice\ntheir lives to exterminate slavery are dissatisfied. They see no good\nresults from the war, only the preservation of the Union, and for\nthis thousands of lives must be sacrificed and homes made deso-\nlate. Great numbers have wasted away and expired in hospitals; [255]\nothers have been taken prisoners by the rebels, a fate more to be\ndreaded than death. In view of all this, they inquire: If we succeed in\nquelling this rebellion, what has been gained? They can only answer\ndiscouragingly: Nothing. That which caused the rebellion is not\nremoved. The system of slavery, which has ruined our nation, is left\nto live and stir up another rebellion. The feelings of thousands of\nour soldiers are bitter. They suffer the greatest privations; these they\nwould willingly endure, but they find they have been deceived, and\nthey are dispirited. Our leading men are perplexed, their hearts are\nfailing them for fear. They fear to proclaim freedom to the slaves of\nthe rebels, for by so doing they will exasperate that portion of the\nSouth who have not joined the rebellion but are strong slavery men.\nAnd again they have feared the influence of those strong antislavery\nmen who were in command, holding responsible stations. They have\nfeared the effects of a bold, decided tone, for it fanned to a flame\nthe strong desire of thousands to wipe out the cause of this terrible\nrebellion, by letting the oppressed go free and breaking every yoke.\nMany of those who are placed high in command to fill responsi-\nble stations have but little conscience or nobility of soul; they can\n250 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nexercise their power, even to the destruction of those under them,\nand it is winked at. These commanders could abuse the power given\nthem and cause those subject to them to occupy dangerous positions\nwhere they would be exposed to terrible encounters with the rebels\nwithout the least hope of conquering them. In this way they could\ndispose of daring, thoroughgoing men, as David disposed of Uriah.\n2 Samuel 11:14, 15.\nValuable men have thus been sacrificed to get rid of their strong\nantislavery influence. Some of the very men whom the North most\nneed in this critical time, whose services would be of the highest\nvalue, are not. They have been wantonly sacrificed. The prospects\nbefore our nation are discouraging, for there are those filling respon-[256]\nsible stations who are rebels at heart. There are commanding officers\nwho are in sympathy with the rebels. While they are desirous of\nhaving the Union preserved, they despise those who are antislavery.\nSome of the armies also are composed largely of such material; they\nare so opposed to one another that no real union exists among many\nregiments.\nAs this war was shown to me, it looked like the most singular\nand uncertain that has ever occurred. A great share of the volunteers\nenlisted fully believing that the result of the war would be to abolish\nslavery. Others enlisted intending to be very careful to keep slavery\njust as it is, but to put down the rebellion and preserve the Union.\nAnd then to make the matter still more perplexing and uncertain,\nsome of the officers in command are strong proslavery men whose\nsympathies are all with the South, yet who are opposed to a sepa-\nrate government. It seems impossible to have the war conducted\nsuccessfully, for many in our own ranks are continually working to\nfavor the South, and our armies have been repulsed and unmercifully\nslaughtered on account of the management of these proslavery men.\nSome of our leading men in Congress also are constantly working\nto favor the South. In this state of things, proclamations are issued\nfor national fasts, for prayer that God will bring this war to a speedy\nand favorable termination. I was then directed to Isaiah 58:5-7: \u201cIs\nit such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul?\nis it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and\nashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to\nthe Lord? Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands\nNorth and the South 251\nof wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed\ngo free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread\nto the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy\nhouse? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that [257]\nthou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\u201d\nI saw that these national fasts were an insult to Jehovah. He\naccepts of no such fasts. The recording angel writes in regard to\nthem: \u201cYe fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of\nwickedness.\u201d I was shown how our leading men have treated the\npoor slaves who have come to them for protection. Angels have\nrecorded it. Instead of breaking their yoke and letting the oppressed\ngo free, these men have made the yoke more galling for them than\nwhen in the service of their tyrannical masters. Love of liberty leads\nthe poor slaves to leave their masters and risk their lives to obtain\nliberty. They would never venture to leave their masters and expose\nthemselves to the difficulties and horrors attending their recapture if\nthey had not as strong a love for liberty as any of us. The escaped\nslaves have endured untold hardships and dangers to obtain their\nfreedom, and as their last hope, with the love of liberty burning in\ntheir breasts, they apply to our Government for protection; but their\nconfidence has been treated with the utmost contempt. Many of\nthem have been cruelly treated because they committed so great a\ncrime as to dare to make an effort to obtain their freedom. Great\nmen, professing to have human hearts, have seen the slaves almost\nnaked and starving, and have abused them, and sent them back to\ntheir cruel masters and hopeless bondage, to suffer inhuman cruelty\nfor daring to seek their liberty. Some of this wretched class they\nthrust into unwholesome dungeons, to live or die, they cared not\nwhich. They have deprived them of the liberty and free air which\nheaven has never denied them, and then left them to suffer for food\nand clothing. In view of all this, a national fast is proclaimed! Oh,\nwhat an insult to Jehovah! The Lord saith by the mouth of Isaiah:\n\u201cYet they seek Me daily, and delight to know My ways, as a nation\nthat did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God.\u201d\nThe escaped slaves have been told by their masters that the [258]\nNorthern men wanted to get possession of them that they might\ncruelly misuse them; that the abolitionists would treat them worse\nthan they had been treated while in slavery. All manner of horrible\n252 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nstories have been repeated in their ears to make them detest the\nNorth, and yet they have had a confused idea that some hearts in the\nNorth felt for their grievances and would yet make an effort to help\nthem. This has been the only star which has shed its glimmering\nlight upon their distressed and gloomy bondage. The manner in\nwhich the poor slaves have been treated has led them to believe that\ntheir masters have told them the truth in these things. And yet a\nnational fast is proclaimed! Saith the Lord: \u201cIs not this the fast that\nI have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy\nburdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every\nyoke?\u201d When our nation observes the fast which God has chosen,\nthen will He accept their prayers as far as the war is concerned;\nbut now they enter not into His ear. He turns from them, they are\ndisgusting to Him. It is so managed that those who would undo the\nheavy burdens and break every yoke are placed under censure, or\nremoved from responsible stations, or their lives are planned away\nby those who \u201cfast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of\nwickedness.\u201d\nI was shown that if the object of this war had been to exterminate\nslavery, then, if desired, England would have helped the North. But\nEngland fully understands the existing feelings in the Government,\nand that the war is not to do away slavery, but merely to preserve\nthe Union; and it is not for her interest to have it preserved. Our\nGovernment has been very proud and independent. The people\nof this nation have exalted themselves to heaven, and have looked\ndown upon monarchical governments, and triumphed in their boasted\nliberty, while the institution of slavery, that was a thousand times\nworse than the tyranny exercised by monarchial governments, was[259]\nsuffered to exist and was cherished. In this land of light a system is\ncherished which allows one portion of the human family to enslave\nanother portion, degrading millions of human beings to the level of\nthe brute creation. The equal of this sin is not to be found in heathen\nlands.\nSaid the angel: \u201cHear, O heavens, the cry of the oppressed, and\nreward the oppressors double according to their deeds.\u201d This nation\nwill yet be humbled into the dust. England is studying whether it is\nbest to take advantage of the present weak condition of our nation,\nand venture to make war upon her. She is weighing the matter, and\nNorth and the South 253\ntrying to sound other nations. She fears, if she should commence war\nabroad, that she would be weak at home, and that other nations would\ntake advantage of her weakness. Other nations are making quiet yet\nactive preparations for war, and are hoping that England will make\nwar with our nation, for then they would improve the opportunity to\nbe revenged on her for the advantage she has taken of them in the past\nand the injustice done them. A portion of the queen\u2019s subjects are\nwaiting a favorable opportunity to break their yoke; but if England\nthinks it will pay, she will not hesitate a moment to improve her\nopportunities to exercise her power and humble our nation. When\nEngland does declare war, all nations will have an interest of their\nown to serve, and there will be general war, general confusion.\nEngland is acquainted with the diversity of feeling among those who\nare seeking to quell the rebellion. She well knows the perplexed\ncondition of our Government; she has looked with astonishment\nat the prosecution of this war\u2014the slow, inefficient moves, the\ninactivity of our armies, and the ruinous expenses of our nation.\nThe weakness of our Government is fully open before other nations,\nand they now conclude that it is because it was not a monarchial\ngovernment, and they admire their own government, and look down,\nsome with pity, others with contempt, upon our nation, which they [260]\nhave regarded as the most powerful upon the globe. Had our nation\nremained united it would have had strength, but divided it must fall.\n* * * * *\nChapter 54\u2014Great Distress Coming\nI saw greater distress in the land than we have yet witnessed. I\nheard groans and cries of distress, and saw large companies in active\nbattle. I heard the booming of the cannon, the clash of arms, the\nhand-to-hand fight, and the groans and prayers of the dying. The\nground was covered with the wounded and the dead. I saw desolate,\ndespairing families, and pinching want in many dwellings. Even\nnow many families are suffering want, but this will increase. The\nfaces of many looked haggard, pale, and pinched with hunger.\nI was shown that the people of God should be closely united\nin the bonds of Christian fellowship and love. God alone can be\nour shield and strength in this time of our national calamities. The\npeople of God should awake. Their opportunities to spread the truth\nshould be improved, for they will not last long. I was shown distress\nand perplexity and famine in the land. Satan is now seeking to hold\nGod\u2019s people in a state of inactivity, to keep them from acting their\npart in spreading the truth, that they may at last be weighed in the\nbalance and found wanting.\nGod\u2019s people must take warning and discern the signs of the\ntimes. The signs of Christ\u2019s coming are too plain to be doubted, and\nin view of these things everyone who professes the truth should be a\nliving preacher. God calls upon all, both preachers and people, to\nawake. All heaven is astir. The scenes of earth\u2019s history are fast clos-\ning. We are amid the perils of the last days. Greater perils are before\nus, and yet we are not awake. This lack of activity and earnestness\nin the cause of God is dreadful. This death stupor is from Satan. He[261]\ncontrols the minds of unconsecrated Sabbathkeepers, and leads them\nto be jealous of one another, faultfinding, and censorious. It is his\nspecial work to divide hearts that the influence, strength, and labor\nof God\u2019s servants may be kept among unconsecrated Sabbathkeepers\nand their precious time be occupied in settling little differences when\nit should be spent in proclaiming the truth to unbelievers.\n254\nGreat Distress Coming 255\nI was shown God\u2019s people waiting for some change to take\nplace\u2014a compelling power to take hold of them. But they will be\ndisappointed, for they are wrong. They must act, they must take\nhold of the work themselves and earnestly cry to God for a true\nknowledge of themselves. The scenes which are passing before us\nare of sufficient magnitude to cause us to arouse and urge the truth\nhome to the hearts of all who will listen. The harvest of the earth is\nnearly ripe.\nI was shown how important it is that the ministers who engage\nin the solemn, responsible work of proclaiming the third angel\u2019s\nmessage be right. The Lord is not straitened for means or instruments\nwith which to do His own work. He can speak at any time, by whom\nHe will, and His word is powerful and will accomplish the thing\nwhereunto it is sent. But if the truth has not sanctified, made pure\nand clean, the hands and heart of him who ministers in holy things,\nhe is liable to speak according to his own imperfect experience; and\nwhen he speaks of himself, according to the decisions of his own\nunsanctified judgment, his counsel is not then of God, but of himself.\nAs he that is called of God is called to be holy, so he that is approved\nand set apart of men must give evidence of his holy calling and show\nforth in his heavenly conversation and conduct that he is faithful to\nHim who hath called him.\nThere are fearful woes for those who preach the truth, but are [262]\nnot sanctified by it, and also for those who consent to receive and\nmaintain the unsanctified to minister to them in word and doctrine. I\nam alarmed for the people of God who profess to believe solemn,\nimportant truth, for I know that many of them are not converted\nnor sanctified through it. Men can hear and acknowledge the whole\ntruth, and yet know nothing of the power of godliness. All who\npreach the truth will not themselves be saved by it. Said the angel:\n\u201cBe ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.\u201d\nThe time has come when those who choose the Lord for their\npresent and future portion must trust in Him alone. Everyone pro-\nfessing godliness must have an experience of his own. The recording\nangel is making a faithful record of the words and acts of God\u2019s peo-\nple. Angels are watching the development of character and weighing\nmoral worth. Those who profess to believe the truth should be right\nthemselves and exert all their influence to enlighten and win others\n256 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto the truth. Their words and works are the channel through which\nthe pure principles of truth and holiness are conveyed to the world.\nThey are the salt of the earth and the light thereof. I saw that in\nlooking heavenward we shall see light and peace, but in looking to\nthe world we shall see that every refuge must soon fail us and every\ngood soon pass away. There is no help for us but in God; in this state\nof earth\u2019s confusion we can be composed, strong, or safe, only in\nthe strength of living faith; nor can we be at peace, only as we rest\nin God and wait for His salvation. Greater light shines upon us than\nshone upon our fathers. We cannot be accepted or honored of God in\nrendering the same service, or doing the same works, that our fathers\ndid. In order to be accepted and blessed of God as they were, we\nmust imitate their faithfulness and zeal,\u2014improve our light as they\nimproved theirs,\u2014and do as they would have done had they lived in\nour day. We must walk in the light which shines upon us, otherwise\nthat light will become darkness. God requires of us to exhibit to[263]\nthe world, in our character and works, that measure of the spirit of\nunion and oneness which is in accordance with the sacred truths we\nprofess and with the spirit of those prophecies that are fulfilling in\nthese last days. The truth which has reached our understanding, and\nthe light which has shone on the soul, will judge and condemn us, if\nwe turn away and refuse to be led by them.\nWhat shall I say to arouse the remnant people of God? I was\nshown that dreadful scenes are before us; Satan and his angels are\nbringing all their powers to bear upon God\u2019s people. He knows that\nif they sleep a little longer he is sure of them, for their destruction\nis certain. I warn all who profess the name of Christ to closely\nexamine themselves and make full and thorough confession of all\ntheir wrongs, that they may go beforehand to judgment, and that the\nrecording angel may write pardon opposite their names. My brother,\nmy sister, if these precious moments of mercy are not improved, you\nwill be left without excuse. If you make no special effort to arouse,\nif you will not manifest zeal in repenting, these golden moments\nwill soon pass, and you will be weighed in the balance and found\nwanting. Then your agonizing cries will be of no avail. Then will\napply the words of the Lord: \u201cBecause I have called, and ye refused;\nI have stretched out My hand, and no man regarded; but ye have set\nat nought all My counsel, and would none of My reproof: I also will\nGreat Distress Coming 257\nlaugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when\nyour fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a\nwhirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. Then shall\nthey call upon Me, but I will not answer; they shall seek Me early,\nbut they shall not find Me: for that they hated knowledge, and did\nnot choose the fear of the Lord: they would none of My counsel:\nthey despised all My reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of\ntheir own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning\naway of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall [264]\ndestroy them. But whoso hearkeneth unto Me shall dwell safely, and\nshall be quiet from fear of evil.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 55\u2014Slavery and the War\nGod is punishing this nation for the high crime of slavery. He has\nthe destiny of the nation in His hands. He will punish the South for\nthe sin of slavery, and the North for so long suffering its overreaching\nand overbearing influence.\nAt the Conference at Roosevelt, New York, August 3, 1861,\nwhen the brethren and sisters were assembled on the day set apart\nfor humiliation, fasting, and prayer, the Spirit of the Lord rested\nupon us, and I was taken off in vision and shown the sin of slav-\nery, which has so long been a curse to this nation. The fugitive\nslave law was calculated to crush out of man every noble, generous\nfeeling of sympathy that should arise in his heart for the oppressed\nand suffering slave. It was in direct opposition to the teaching of\nChrist. God\u2019s scourge is now upon the North, because they have\nso long submitted to the advances of the slave power. The sin of\nNorthern proslavery men is great. They have strengthened the South\nin their sin by sanctioning the extension of slavery; they have acted\na prominent part in bringing the nation into its present distressed\ncondition.\nI was shown that many do not realize the extent of the evil which\nhas come upon us. They have flattered themselves that the national\ndifficulties would soon be settled and confusion and war end, but all\nwill be convinced that there is more reality in the matter than was\nanticipated. Many have looked for the North to strike a blow and\nend the controversy.\nI was pointed back to ancient Israel, held in bondage by the\nEgyptians. The Lord wrought by Moses and Aaron to deliver them.\nMiracles were performed before Pharaoh to convince him that these[265]\nmen were especially sent of God to bid him let Israel go. But\nPharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened against the messengers of God, and he\nreasoned away the miracles performed by them. Then the Egyptians\nwere made to feel God\u2019s judgments. They were visited with plagues,\nand while suffering under the effect of them, Pharaoh consented\n258\nSlavery and the War 259\nto let Israel go. But as soon as the cause of their suffering was\nremoved, his heart was hardened. His counselors and mighty men\nstrengthened themselves against God and endeavored to explain the\nplagues as the result of natural causes. Each visitation from God\nwas more severe than the preceding one, yet they would not release\nthe children of Israel until the angel of the Lord slew the first-born\nof the Egyptians. From the king upon the throne down to the most\nhumble and lowly, there was wailing and mourning. Then Pharaoh\ncommanded to let Israel go; but after the Egyptians had buried their\ndead, he repented that he had let Israel go. His counselors and\nmighty men tried to account for their bereavement. They would not\nadmit that the visitation or judgment was from God, and therefore\nthey pursued after the children of Israel.\nWhen the Israelites beheld the Egyptian host in pursuit, some\nupon horses and some in chariots, and equipped for war, their hearts\nfailed them. The Red Sea was before, the Egyptian host behind.\nThey could see no way of escape. A shout of triumph burst from\nthe Egyptians to find Israel completely in their power. The Israelites\nwere greatly terrified. But the Lord commanded Moses to bid them\ngo forward, and to lift up the rod and stretch out his hand over the\nsea and divide it. He did so, and lo, the sea parted, and the children\nof Israel passed over dry shod. Pharaoh had so long withstood God,\nand hardened his heart against His mighty, wondrous works, that\nhe in blindness rushed into the path which God had miraculously\nprepared for His people. Again Moses was commanded to stretch\nforth his hand over the sea, \u201cand the sea returned to his strength,\u201d [266]\nand the waters covered the Egyptian host, and they were drowned.\nThis scene was presented before me to illustrate the selfish love\nof slavery, and the desperate measures which the South would adopt\nto cherish the institution, and the dreadful lengths to which they\nwould go before they would yield. The system of slavery has re-\nduced and degraded human beings to the level of the brutes, and the\nmajority of slave masters regard them as such. The consciences of\nthese masters have become seared and hardened, as was Pharaoh\u2019s;\nand if compelled to release their slaves, their principles remain un-\nchanged, and they would make the slave feel their oppressive power\nif possible. It looked to me like an impossibility now for slavery to\nbe done away. God alone can wrench the slave from the hand of his\n260 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndesperate, relentless oppressor. All the abuse and cruelty exercised\ntoward the slave is justly chargeable to the upholders of the slave\nsystem, whether they be Southern or Northern men.\nThe North and the South were presented before me. The North\nhave been deceived in regard to the South. They are better prepared\nfor war than has been represented. Most of their men are well skilled\nin the use of arms, some of them from experience in battle, others\nfrom habitual sporting. They have the advantage of the North in this\nrespect, but have not, as a general thing, the valor and the power of\nendurance that Northern men have.\nI had a view of the disastrous battle at Manassas, Virginia. It\nwas a most exciting, distressing scene. The Southern army had\neverything in their favor and were prepared for a dreadful contest.\nThe Northern army was moving on with triumph, not doubting but\nthat they would be victorious. Many were reckless and marched\nforward boastingly, as though victory were already theirs. As they\nneared the battlefield, many were almost fainting through weariness\nand want of refreshment. They did not expect so fierce an encounter.\nThey rushed into battle and fought bravely, desperately. The dead[267]\nand dying were on every side. Both the North and the South suffered\nseverely. The Southern men felt the battle, and in a little while\nwould have been driven back still further. The Northern men were\nrushing on, although their destruction was very great. Just then an\nangel descended and waved his hand backward. Instantly there was\nconfusion in the ranks. It appeared to the Northern men that their\ntroops were retreating, when it was not so in reality, and a precipitate\nretreat commenced. This seemed wonderful to me.\nThen it was explained that God had this nation in His own hand,\nand would not suffer victories to be gained faster than He ordained,\nand would permit no more losses to the Northern men than in His\nwisdom He saw fit, to punish them for their sins. And had the\nNorthern army at this time pushed the battle still further in their\nfainting, exhausted condition, the far greater struggle and destruction\nwhich awaited them would have caused great triumph in the South.\nGod would not permit this, and sent an angel to interfere. The sudden\nfalling back of the Northern troops is a mystery to all. They know\nnot that God\u2019s hand was in the matter.\nSlavery and the War 261\nThe destruction of the Southern army was so great that they had\nno heart to boast. The sight of the dead, the dying, and the wounded\ngave them but little courage to triumph. This destruction, occurring\nwhen they had every advantage, and the North great disadvantage,\ncaused them much perplexity. They know that if the North have\nan equal chance with them, victory is certain for the North. Their\nonly hope is to occupy positions difficult of approach, and then have\nformidable arrangements to hurl destruction on every hand.\nThe South have strengthened themselves greatly since their re-\nbellion first commenced. If active measures had then been taken\nby the North, this rebellion would have been speedily crushed out.\nBut that which was small at first has increased in strength and num-\nbers until it has become most powerful. Other nations are intently [268]\nwatching this nation, for what purpose I was not informed, and are\nmaking great preparations for some event. The greatest perplexity\nand anxiety now exists among our national men. Proslavery men and\ntraitors are in the very midst of them; and while these are professedly\nin favor of the Union, they have an influence in making decisions,\nsome of which even favor the South.\nI was shown the inhabitants of the earth in the utmost confusion.\nWar, bloodshed, privation, want, famine, and pestilence were abroad\nin the land. As these things surrounded God\u2019s people, they began to\npress together, and to cast aside their little difficulties. Self-dignity\nno longer controlled them; deep humility took its place. Suffering,\nperplexity, and privation caused reason to resume its throne, and\nthe passionate and unreasonable man became sane, and acted with\ndiscretion and wisdom.\nMy attention was then called from the scene. There seemed to\nbe a little time of peace. Once more the inhabitants of the earth were\npresented before me; and again everything was in the utmost confu-\nsion. Strife, war, and bloodshed, with famine and pestilence, raged\neverywhere. Other nations were engaged in this war and confusion.\nWar caused famine. Want and bloodshed caused pestilence. And\nthen men\u2019s hearts failed them for fear, \u201cand for looking after those\nthings which are coming on the earth.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 56\u2014Perilous Times\nThe unbelieving world will soon have something to think of\nbesides their dress and appearance; and as their minds are torn from\nthese things by distress and perplexity, they will have nothing to turn\nto. They are not prisoners of hope, and therefore do not turn to the\nStronghold. Their hearts will fail them for repining and fear. They[269]\nhave not made God their refuge, and He will not be their consolation\nthen, but will laugh at their calamity, and mock when their fear\ncometh. They have despised and trampled upon the truths of God\u2019s\nword. They have indulged in extravagant dress, and have spent their\nlives in hilarity and glee. They have sown to the wind; they must\nreap the whirlwind. In the time of distress and perplexity of nations\nthere will be many who have not given themselves wholly to the\ncorrupting influences of the world and the service of Satan, who will\nhumble themselves before God and turn to Him with their whole\nheart and find acceptance and pardon.\nThose among Sabbathkeepers who have been unwilling to make\nany sacrifice, but have yielded to the influence of the world, are to\nbe tested and proved. The perils of the last days are upon us, and a\ntrial is before the young which they have not anticipated. They are\nto be brought into most distressing perplexity. The genuineness of\ntheir faith will be proved. They profess to be looking for the coming\nof the Son of man, yet some of them have been a miserable example\nto unbelievers. They have not been willing to give up the world, but\nhave united with them, have attended picnics and other gatherings of\npleasure, flattering themselves that they were engaging in innocent\namusement. Yet I was shown that it is just such indulgences that\nseparate them from God and make them children of the world. God\ndoes not own the pleasure seeker as His follower. He has given us no\nsuch example. Those only who are self-denying, and who live a life\nof sobriety, humility, and holiness, are true followers of Jesus; and\nsuch cannot engage in and enjoy the frivolous, empty conversation\nof the lovers of the world.\n262\nPerilous Times 263\nA day of heart-rending anguish is before us. I was shown that\npointed testimonies should be borne, and that those who will come up\nto the help of the Lord will receive His blessing. But Sabbathkeepers [270]\nhave a work to do. Hoops, I was shown, are an abomination, and\nevery Sabbathkeeper\u2019s influence should be a rebuke to this ridiculous\nfashion, which has been a screen to iniquity, and which arose from\na house of ill fame in Paris. Individuals were shown me who will\ndespise instruction, even if it comes from heaven; they will frame\nsome excuse to avoid the most pointed testimony, and in defiance\nof all the light given will put on hoops because it is the fashion, and\nrisk the consequences.\nThe prophecy of Isaiah 3 was presented before me as applying\nto these last days, and the reproofs are given to the daughters of\nZion who have thought only of appearance and display. Read verse\n25: \u201cThy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.\u201d I\nwas shown that this scripture will be strictly fulfilled. Young men\nand women professing to be Christians, yet having no Christian\nexperience, and having borne no burdens and felt no individual\nresponsibility, are to be proved. They will be brought low in the dust\nand will long for an experience in the things of God, which they\nhave failed to obtain.\nWar lifts his helmet to his brow;\nO God, protect Thy people now.\n* * * * *\nChapter 57\u2014Organization\nAugust 3, 1861, I was shown that some have feared that our\nchurches would become Babylon if they should organize; but those\nin central New York have been perfect Babylon, confusion. And\nnow unless the churches are so organized that they can carry out\nand enforce order, they have nothing to hope for in the future; they\nmust scatter into fragments. Previous teachings have nourished the\nelements of disunion. A spirit has been cherished to watch and\naccuse, rather than to build up. If ministers of God would unitedly\ntake their position, and maintain it with decision, there would be a[271]\nuniting influence among the flock of God. Separating bars would be\nbroken to fragments. Hearts would flow together and unite like drops\nof water. Then there would be a power and strength in the ranks of\nSabbathkeepers far exceeding anything we have yet witnessed.\nThe hearts of God\u2019s servants are made sad as they journey from\nchurch to church, by meeting the opposing influence of other min-\nistering brethren. There are those who have stood ready to oppose\nevery advance step that God\u2019s people have taken. The hearts of\nthose who have dared to venture out are saddened and distressed\nby the lack of union of action on the part of their fellow laborers.\nWe are living in a solemn time. Satan and evil angels are working\nwith mighty power, with the world on their side to help them. And\nprofessed Sabbathkeepers who claim to believe solemn, important\ntruth unite their forces with the combined influence of the powers of\ndarkness to distract and tear down that which God designs to build\nup. The influence of such is recorded as of those who retard the\nadvancement of reform among God\u2019s people.\nThe agitation of the subject of organization has revealed a great\nlack of moral courage on the part of the ministers proclaiming\npresent truth. Some who were convinced that organization was\nright have failed to stand up boldly and advocate it. They let some\nfew understand that they favored it. Was this all that God required\nof them? No; He was displeased with their cowardly silence and\n264\nOrganization 265\nlack of action. They feared blame and opposition. They watched\nthe brethren generally to see how their pulse beat, before standing\nmanfully for what they believed to be right. The people waited for\nthe voice of their favorite ministers, and because they could hear\nno response in its favor from them, decided that organization was\nwrong.\nThus the influence of some of the ministers was against organi-\nzation, while they professed to be in favor of it. They were afraid of [272]\nlosing their influence. But someone must move out and bear respon-\nsibility, and venture his influence; and as the one who has done this\nhas become inured to censure and blame, he is suffered to bear it.\nHis fellow laborers, who should stand by his side and take their share\nof the burden, are looking on to see how he succeeds in fighting the\nbattle alone. But God marks his distress, his anguish, his tears, his\ndiscouragement and despair, while his mind is taxed almost beyond\nendurance; and when ready to sink, God lifts him up and points\nhim to the rest for the weary, the reward for the faithful; and again\nhe puts his shoulder under the heavy burden. I saw that all will be\nrewarded as their works shall be. Those who shun responsibility will\nmeet with loss in the end. The time for ministers to stand together is\nwhen the battle goes hard.\n* * * * *\nChapter 58\u2014Duty to the Poor\nInquiries are often made in regard to our duty to the poor who\nembrace the third message; and we ourselves have long been anxious\nto know how to manage with discretion the cases of poor families\nwho embrace the Sabbath. But while at Roosevelt, New York,\nAugust 3, 1861, I was shown some things in regard to the poor.\nGod does not require our brethren to take charge of every poor\nfamily that shall embrace this message. If they should do this, the\nministers must cease to enter new fields, for the funds would be\nexhausted. Many are poor from their own lack of diligence and\neconomy; they know not how to use means aright. If they should be\nhelped, it would hurt them. Some will always be poor. If they should\nhave the very best advantages, their cases would not be helped. They\nhave not good calculation and would use all the means they could\nobtain, were it much or little. Some know nothing of denying self\nand economizing to keep out of debt and to get a little ahead for a[273]\ntime of need. If the church should help such individuals instead of\nleaving them to rely upon their own resources, it would injure them\nin the end, for they look to the church and expect to receive help\nfrom them and do not practice self-denial and economy when they\nare well provided for. And if they do not receive help every time,\nSatan tempts them, and they become jealous and very conscientious\nfor their brethren, fearing they will fail to do all their duty to them.\nThe mistake is on their own part. They are deceived. They are not\nthe Lord\u2019s poor.\nThe instructions given in the word of God in regard to helping\nthe poor do not touch such cases, but are for the unfortunate and\nafflicted. God in His providence has afflicted individuals to test\nand prove others. Widows and invalids are in the church to prove a\nblessing to the church. They are a part of the means which God has\nchosen to develop the true character of Christ\u2019s professed followers\nand to call into exercise the precious traits of character manifested\nby our compassionate Redeemer.\n266\nDuty to the Poor 267\nMany who can but barely live when they are single, choose to\nmarry and raise a family when they know they have nothing with\nwhich to support them. And worse than this, they have no family\ngovernment. Their whole course in their family is marked with their\nloose, slack habits. They have but little control over themselves,\nand are passionate, impatient, and fretful. When such embrace the\nmessage, they feel that they are entitled to assistance from their\nmore wealthy brethren; and if their expectations are not met, they\ncomplain of the church and accuse them of not living out their faith.\nWho must be the sufferers in this case? Must the cause of God be\nsapped, and the treasury in different places exhausted, to take care of\nthese large families of poor? No. The parents must be the sufferers.\nThey will not, as a general thing, suffer any greater lack after they\nembrace the Sabbath than they did before.\nThere is an evil among some of the poor which will certainly [274]\nprove their ruin unless they overcome it. They have embraced the\ntruth with their coarse, rough, uncultivated habits, and it takes some\ntime for them to see and realize their coarseness, and that it is not in\naccordance with the character of Christ. They look upon others who\nare more orderly and refined as being proud, and you may hear them\nsay: \u201cThe truth brings us all down upon a level.\u201d But it is an entire\nmistake to think that the truth brings the receiver down. It brings\nhim up, refines his taste, sanctifies his judgment, and, if lived out, is\ncontinually fitting him for the society of holy angels in the City of\nGod. The truth is designed to bring us all up upon a level.\nThe more able should ever act a noble, generous part in their deal\nwith their poorer brethren, and should also give them good advice,\nand then leave them to fight life\u2019s battles through. But I was shown\nthat a most solemn duty rests upon the church to have an especial\ncare for the destitute widows, orphans, and invalids.\n* * * * *\nChapter 59\u2014Power of Example\nIn the epistle of Paul to Titus, chapter 2:13, 14, we read: \u201cLook-\ning for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great\nGod and our Saviour Jesus Christ; who gave Himself for us, that\nHe might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a\npeculiar people, zealous of good works.\u201d This great work is to be\nperformed for those only who are willing to be purified, willing to\nbe peculiar, and who manifest a zeal in good works. How many\nshrink from the purifying process! They are unwilling to live out the\ntruth, unwilling to appear singular in the eyes of the world. It is this\nmingling with the world that destroys our spirituality, pureness, and\nzeal. Satan\u2019s power is constantly exercised to stupefy the sensibili-[275]\nties of God\u2019s people, that their consciences may not be sensitive to\nwrong, and that the sign of distinction between them and the world\nmay be destroyed.\nI have frequently received letters of inquiry in regard to dress,\nand some have not rightly understood what I have written. The very\nclass that have been presented before me as imitating the fashions\nof the world have been very slow, and the last, to be affected or\nreformed. Another class who lacked taste and order in dress have\ntaken advantage of what I have written and have gone to the opposite\nextreme; considering that they were free from pride, they have\nlooked upon those who dress neatly and orderly as being proud.\nOddity and carelessness in dress have been considered a special\nvirtue by some. Such take a course which destroys their influence\nover unbelievers. They disgust those whom they might benefit.\nWhile the visions have reproved pride and imitating the fashions\nof the world, they have also reproved those who were careless in\nregard to their apparel and lacked cleanliness of person and dress.\nEspecially have I been shown that those who profess present truth\nshould have a special care to appear before God upon the Sabbath\nin a manner which would show that we respect the Creator who\nhas sanctified and placed special honors upon that day. All who\n268\nPower of Example 269\nhave any regard for the Sabbath should be cleanly in person, neat\nand orderly in dress; for they are to appear before the jealous God,\nwho is offended at uncleanliness and disorder, and who marks every\ntoken of disrespect. Some have thought it wrong to wear anything\nupon their heads but a sunbonnet. Such go to great extremes. It\ncannot be called pride to wear a neat, plain straw or silk bonnet. Our\nfaith, if carried out, will lead us to be so plain in dress, and zealous\nof good works, that we shall be marked as peculiar. But when we\nlose taste for order and neatness in dress we virtually leave the truth,\nfor the truth never degrades, but elevates. Unbelievers look upon [276]\nSabbathkeepers as degraded, and when persons are neglectful of\ntheir dress, and coarse and rough in their manners, their influence\nstrengthens unbelievers in this conclusion.\nThose who profess to be Christians amid the perils of the last\ndays, and do not imitate the humble, self-denying Pattern, place\nthemselves in the enemy\u2019s ranks. He considers them his subjects,\nand they serve as important a purpose for him as do any of his\nsubjects, for they have a name to live, and are dead. Others take\nthem as an example, and by following them lose heaven, when,\nhad these not professed to be Christians, their example would have\nbeen shunned. These unconsecrated professors are not aware of the\nweight of their influence. They make the conflict much more severe\nfor those who would be God\u2019s peculiar people. Paul, in Titus 2:15,\nrefers to the people who are looking for the appearing of Christ. He\nsays: \u201cThese things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.\nLet no man despise thee.\u201d\nAs we bear testimony against pride and following the fashions\nof the world, we are met with excuses and self-justification. Some\nurge the example of others. Such a sister wears hoops; if it is wrong\nfor me to wear them, it is wrong for her. Children urge the example\nof other children, whose parents are Sabbathkeepers. Brother A is a\ndeacon of the church. His children wear hoops, and why is it any\nworse for me to wear them than it is for them? Those who by their\nexample furnish unconsecrated professors with arguments against\nthose who would be peculiar, are laying a cause of stumbling in\nthe way of the weak; they must render an account to God for their\nexample. I am often asked: \u201cWhat do you think of hoops?\u201d I reply: I\nhave given you the light which has been given me. I was shown that\n270 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhoops are a shame, and that we should not give the least countenance\nto a fashion carried to such ridiculous lengths.\nI am often surprised to hear that \u201cSister White says it is not[277]\nwrong to wear small hoops.\u201d No one has ever heard me say this.\nAfter seeing what I have in regard to hoops, nothing would induce\nme to give the least encouragement to any to wear them. Heavy\nquilts and hoops are alike unnecessary. He that framed us never\ndesigned that we should be deformed with hoops, or anything to\nlook like them. But God\u2019s people have so long been led by the\ninventions and fashions of the world that they are unwilling to move\nout independent of them. When I study the Scriptures, I am alarmed\nfor the Israel of God in these last days. They are exhorted to flee\nfrom idolatry. I fear that they are asleep and so conformed to the\nworld that it would be difficult to discern between him that serveth\nGod and him that serveth Him not. The distance is widening between\nChrist and His people, and lessening between them and the world.\nThe marks of distinction between Christ\u2019s professed people and the\nworld have almost disappeared. Like ancient Israel, they follow after\nthe abominations of the nations around them.\nFrom what has been shown me, hoops are an abomination. They\nare indecent; and God\u2019s people err if they in the least degree follow,\nor give countenance to, this fashion. Those who profess to be God\u2019s\nchosen, peculiar people, should discard hoops, and their practice\nshould be a living rebuke to those who wear them. Some may plead\nconvenience. I have traveled much, and have seen a great deal of\ninconvenience attending the wearing of hoops. Those who plead\nnecessity on account of health, wear them in the winter, when they\nare a greater injury than quilted skirts. While traveling in the cars\nand stages, I have often been led to exclaim: O Modesty, where\nis thy blush! I have seen large companies crowding into the cars,\nand in order to make any headway, the hoops had to be raised and\nplaced in a shape which was indecent. And the exposure of the form\nwas tenfold more with those who wore hoops, than with those who\ndid not. Were it not for fashion, those who thus immodestly expose[278]\nthemselves would be hissed at; but modesty and decency must be\nsacrificed to the God of fashion. May the Lord deliver His people\nfrom this grievous sin! God will not pity those who will be slaves to\nfashion. But supposing there is some little convenience in wearing\nPower of Example 271\nhoops, does this prove that it is right to wear them? Let the fashion\nchange, and convenience would no longer be mentioned. It is the\nduty of every child of God to inquire: \u201cWherein am I separate from\nthe world?\u201d Let us suffer a little inconvenience, and be on the safe\nside. What crosses do God\u2019s people bear? They mingle with the\nworld, partake of their spirit, dress, talk, and act like them.\nRead 1 Timothy 2:9, 10: \u201cIn like manner also, that women adorn\nthemselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety;\nnot with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which\nbecometh women professing godliness) with good works.\u201d Also 1\nPeter 3:3-5: \u201cWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning\nof plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of\napparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not\ncorruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is\nin the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old\ntime the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves,\nbeing in subjection unto their own husbands.\u201d\nThe power of example is great. Sister A ventures to wear small\nhoops. Sister B says: It is no worse for me to wear hoops than for\nSister A, and she wears them a little larger. Sister C imitates the\nexample of Sisters A and B, and wears her hoops a little larger than\nA and B, but all contend that their hoops are small.\nParents who would teach their children the evil of following\nthe fashions of the world, have a hard battle. They are met with:\n\u201cWhy, mother, Sisters A, B, and C wear hoops; if it is wicked for\nme, it is for them.\u201d What can the parents say? They should set a [279]\nright example before their children, and although the example of\nprofessed followers of Christ causes the children to think that their\nparents are too careful and severe in their restrictions, yet God will\nbless the efforts of these conscientious parents. If parents do not take\na decided, firm course, their children will be borne down with the\ncurrent, for Satan and his evil angels are working upon their minds,\nand the example of unconsecrated professors makes the work of\novercoming far more laborious for them. Yet with faith in God and\nearnest prayer, believing parents should press on in the rugged path\nof duty. The way of the cross is an onward, upward way. And as we\nadvance therein, seeking the things that are above, we must leave\nfarther and farther in the distance the things which belong to the\n272 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nearth. While the world and carnal professors are rushing downward\nto death, those who climb the hill will have to put forth efforts or\nthey will be carried down with them.\nThe children of the world are called the children of darkness.\nThey are blinded by the god of this world, and are led by the spirit\nof the prince of darkness. They cannot enjoy heavenly things. The\nchildren of light have their affections set on things above. They\nleave behind them the things of this world. They fulfill the com-\nmand: Come out from among them, and be ye separate.\u201d Here is\nthe conditional promise: \u201cI will receive you.\u201d From the beginning,\nChrist has chosen His people out of the world and required them\nto be separate, having no fellowship with the unfruitful works of\ndarkness. If they love God and keep His commandments, they will\nbe far from having the friendship, and loving the pleasures, of the\nworld. There is no concord between Christ and Belial.\nThe prophet Ezra, and other faithful servants of the Jewish\nchurch, were astonished when the princes came to them saying:\n\u201cThe people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not\nseparated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according[280]\nto their abominations.\u201d \u201cAnd after all that is come upon us for our\nevil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that Thou our God hast\npunished us less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such\ndeliverance as this; should we again break Thy commandments, and\njoin in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not\nThou be angry with us till Thou hadst consumed us, so that there\nshould be no remnant nor escaping? O Lord God of Israel, Thou art\nrighteous: for we remain yet escaped, as it is this day: behold, we\nare before Thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before Thee\nbecause of this.\u201d Ezra 9:1, 13-15.\n2 Chronicles 36:14-16: \u201cMoreover all the chief of the priests,\nand the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations\nof the heathen; and polluted the house of the Lord which He had\nhallowed in Jerusalem. And the Lord God of their fathers sent to\nthem by His messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because\nHe had compassion on His people, and on His dwelling place: but\nthey mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and\nmisused His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His\npeople, till there was no remedy.\u201d\nPower of Example 273\nLeviticus 18:26, 27: \u201cYe shall therefore keep My statutes and\nMy judgments, and shall not commit any of these abominations;\nneither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth\namong you: (for all these abominations have the men of the land\ndone, which were before you, and the land is defiled).\u201d\nDeuteronomy 32:16-22: \u201cThey provoked Him to jealousy with\nstrange gods, with abominations provoked they Him to anger. They\nsacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to\nnew gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. Of the\nRock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that\nformed thee. And when the Lord saw it, He abhorred them, because\nof the provoking of His sons, and of His daughters. And He said, [281]\nI will hide My face from them, I will see what their end shall be:\nfor they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith.\nThey have moved Me to jealousy with that which is not God; they\nhave provoked Me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them\nto jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them\nto anger with a foolish nation. For a fire is kindled in Mine anger,\nand shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with\nher increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.\u201d\nWe here read the warnings which God gave to ancient Israel.\nIt was not His good pleasure that they should wander so long in\nthe wilderness; He would have brought them immediately to the\nPromised Land had they submitted and loved to be led by Him; but\nbecause they so often grieved Him in the desert, He sware in His\nwrath that they should not enter into His rest, save two who wholly\nfollowed Him. God required His people to trust in Him alone. He\ndid not wish them to receive help from those who did not serve Him.\nPlease read Ezra 4:1-5: \u201cNow when the adversaries of Judah\nand Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the\ntemple unto the Lord God of Israel; then they came to Zerubbabel,\nand to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with\nyou: for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto Him\nsince the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up\nhither. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the\nfathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to\nbuild an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build\nunto the Lord God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia hath\n274 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ncommanded us. Then the people of the land weakened the hands\nof the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, and hired\ncounselors against them, to frustrate their purpose.\u201d\nEzra 8:21-23: \u201cThen I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of[282]\nAhava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him\na right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.\nFor I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and\nhorsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had\nspoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them\nfor good that seek Him; but His power and His wrath is against all\nthem that forsake Him. So we fasted and besought our God for this:\nand He was entreated of us.\u201d\nThe prophet and these fathers did not regard the people of the\nland as worshipers of the true God, and though these professed\nfriendship and wished to help them, they dared not unite with them\nin anything relating to His worship. When going up to Jerusalem\nto build the temple of God and to restore His worship, they would\nnot ask help of the king to assist them in the way, but by fasting\nand prayer sought the Lord for help. They believed that God would\ndefend and prosper His servants in their efforts to serve Him. The\nCreator of all things needs not the help of His enemies to establish\nHis worship. He asks not the sacrifice of wickedness, nor accepts\nthe offerings of those who have other gods before the Lord.\nWe often hear the remark: \u201cYou are too exclusive.\u201d As a people\nwe would make any sacrifice to save souls, or lead them to the truth.\nBut to unite with them, to love the things that they love, and have\nfriendship with the world, we dare not, for we should then be at\nenmity with God.\nBy reading the following scriptures we shall see how God re-\ngarded ancient Israel:\nPsalm 135:4: \u201cFor the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto Himself,\nand Israel for His peculiar treasure.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 14:2: \u201cFor thou art an holy people unto the Lord\nthy God, and the Lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto\nHimself, above all the nations that are upon the earth.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 7:6, 7: \u201cFor thou art an holy people unto the Lord[283]\nthy God: the Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people\nunto Himself, above all people that are upon the face of the earth.\nPower of Example 275\nThe Lord did not set His love upon you, nor choose you, because ye\nwere more in number than any people; for ye were the fewest of all\npeople.\u201d\nExodus 33:16: \u201cFor wherein shall it be known here that I and\nThy people have found grace in Thy sight? is it not in that Thou\ngoest with us? so shall we be separated, I and Thy people, from all\nthe people that are upon the face of the earth.\u201d\nHow frequently ancient Israel rebelled, and how often they were\nvisited with judgments, and thousands slain, because they would\nnot heed the commands of God who had chosen them! The Israel\nof God in these last days are in constant danger of mingling with\nthe world and losing all signs of being the chosen people of God.\nRead again Titus 2:13-15. We are here brought down to the last\ndays, when God is purifying unto Himself a peculiar people. Shall\nwe provoke Him as did ancient Israel? Shall we bring His wrath\nupon us by departing from Him and mingling with the world, and\nfollowing the abominations of the nations around us?\nThe Lord hath set apart him that is godly for Himself; this conse-\ncration to God and separation from the world is plainly and positively\nenjoined in both the Old and the New Testament. There is a wall\nof separation which the Lord Himself has established between the\nthings of the world and the things He has chosen out of the world\nand sanctified unto Himself. The calling and character of God\u2019s\npeople are peculiar, their prospects are peculiar, and these peculiar-\nities distinguish them from all other people. All of God\u2019s people\nupon the earth are one body, from the beginning to the end of time.\nThey have one Head that directs and governs the body. The same\ninjunctions that rested upon ancient Israel, rest upon God\u2019s people\nnow, to be separate from the world. The great Head of the church has\nnot changed. The experience of Christians in these days is much like [284]\nthe travels of ancient Israel. Please read 1 Corinthians 10, especially\nfrom the 6th to the 15th verse:\n\u201cNow these things were our examples, to the intent we should\nnot lust after evil things, as they also lusted. Neither be ye idolaters,\nas were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and\ndrink, and rose up to play.... Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of\nthem also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur\nye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the\n276 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndestroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples:\nand they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the\nworld are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take\nheed lest he fall. There hath no temptation taken you but such as\nis common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to\nbe tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also\nmake a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. Wherefore, my\ndearly beloved, flee from idolatry. I speak as to wise men; judge ye\nwhat I say.\u201d\n1 John 3:1: \u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath be-\nstowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore\nthe world knoweth us not, because it knew Him not.\u201d\n1 John 2:15-17: \u201cLove not the world, neither the things that are\nin the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not\nin him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust\nof the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the\nworld. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that\ndoeth the will of God abideth forever.\u201d\n2 Peter 2:20: \u201cFor if after they have escaped the pollutions of the\nworld through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,\nthey are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is\nworse with them than the beginning.\u201d\nJames 4:4: \u201cKnow ye not that the friendship of the world is[285]\nenmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world\nis the enemy of God.\u201d\nJames 1:27: \u201cPure religion and undefiled before God and the\nFather is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,\nand to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d\nTitus 2:12: \u201cTeaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly\nlusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present\nworld.\u201d\nRomans 12:2: \u201cAnd be not conformed to this world: but be ye\ntransformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what\nis that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d\nJohn 17:14, 15, 17: \u201cI have given them Thy word; and the world\nhath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not\nof the world. I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the\nPower of Example 277\nworld, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil.\u201d \u201cSanctify\nthem through Thy truth: Thy word is truth.\u201d\nLuke 6:22, 23: \u201cBlessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and\nwhen they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach\nyou, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man\u2019s sake.\nRejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward\nis great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the\nprophets.\u201d\nJohn 15:16-19: \u201cYe have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you,\nand ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that\nyour fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father\nin My name, He may give it you. These things I command you, that\nye love one another. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated Me\nbefore it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love\nhis own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you\nout of the world, therefore the world hateth you.\u201d\n1 John 4:4, 5: \u201cYe are of God, little children, and have overcome [286]\nthem: because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the\nworld. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and\nthe world heareth them.\u201d\n1 John 2:5, 6: \u201cBut whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the\nlove of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in Him. He that\nsaith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He\nwalked.\u201d\n1 Peter 2:9: \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest-\nhood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth\nthe praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light.\u201d\nAs we read the word of God, how plain it appears that His people\nare to be peculiar and distinct from the unbelieving world around\nthem. Our position is interesting and fearful; living in the last days,\nhow important that we imitate the example of Christ, and walk even\nas He walked. \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself,\nand take up his cross, and follow Me.\u201d The opinions and wisdom\nof men must not guide or govern us. They always lead away from\nthe cross. The servants of Christ have neither their home nor their\ntreasure here. Would that all of them could understand that it is\nonly because the Lord reigns that we are even permitted to dwell\n278 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin peace and safety among our enemies. It is not our privilege to\nclaim special favors of the world. We must consent to be poor and\ndespised among men, until the warfare is finished and the victory\nwon. The members of Christ are called to come out and be separate\nfrom the friendship and spirit of the world; their strength and power\nconsists in being chosen and accepted of God.\nThe Son of God was the heir of all things, and the dominion and\nglory of the kingdoms of this world were promised to Him. Yet when\nHe appeared in this world, it was without riches or splendor. The\nworld understood not His union with the Father; the excellency and\nglory of His divine character were hid from them. He was therefore[287]\n\u201cdespised and rejected of men,\u201d and \u201cwe did esteem Him stricken,\nsmitten of God, and afflicted.\u201d Even as Christ was in the world, so\nare His followers. They are the sons of God, and joint heirs with\nChrist; and the kingdom and dominion belong to them. The world\nunderstand not their character and holy calling; they perceive not\ntheir adoption into the family of God. Their union and fellowship\nwith the Father and Son is not manifest, and while the world behold\ntheir humiliation and reproach, it does not appear what they are, or\nwhat they shall be. They are strangers. The world know them not,\nand appreciate not the motives which actuate them.\nThe world is ripening for its destruction. God can bear with\nsinners but a little longer. They must drink the dregs of the cup of\nHis wrath unmixed with mercy. Those who will be heirs of God, and\njoint heirs with Christ to the immortal inheritance, will be peculiar.\nYes, so peculiar that God places a mark upon them as His, wholly\nHis. Think ye that God will receive, honor, and acknowledge a\npeople so mixed up with the world that they differ from them only\nin name? Read again Titus 2:13-15. It is soon to be known who is\non the Lord\u2019s side, who will not be ashamed of Jesus. Those who\nhave not moral courage to conscientiously take their position in the\nface of unbelievers, leave the fashions of the world, and imitate the\nself-denying life of Christ, are ashamed of Him, and do not love His\nexample.\n* * * * *\nChapter 60\u2014Consecration\nThe people of God will be tested and proved. A close and\nsearching work must go on among Sabbathkeepers. Like ancient\nIsrael, how soon we forget God and His wondrous works, and rebel\nagainst Him. Some look to the world and desire to follow its fashions\nand participate in its pleasure, just as the children of Israel looked [288]\nback to Egypt and lusted for the good things which they had enjoyed\nthere, and which God chose to withhold from them to prove them\nand thereby test their fidelity to Him. He wished to see if His people\nvalued His service, and the freedom He had so miraculously given\nthem, more highly than the indulgences they enjoyed in Egypt while\nin servitude to a tyrannical, idolatrous people.\nAll true followers of Jesus will have sacrifices to make. God\nwill prove them and test the genuineness of their faith. I have been\nshown that the true followers of Jesus will discard picnics, donations,\nshows, and other gatherings for pleasure. They can find no Jesus\nthere, and no influence which will make them heavenly minded and\nincrease their growth in grace. The word of God obeyed leads us\nto come out from all these things and be separate. The things of\nthe world are sought for, and considered worthy to be admired and\nenjoyed, by all those who are not devoted lovers of the cross and\nspiritual worshipers of a crucified Jesus.\nThere is chaff among us, and this is why we are so weak. Some\nare constantly leaning to the world. Their views and feelings har-\nmonize much better with the spirit of the world than with that of\nChrist\u2019s self-denying followers. It is perfectly natural for them to\nprefer the company of those whose spirit will best agree with their\nown. And such have quite too much influence among God\u2019s people.\nThey take part with them, and have a name among them, and are\na text for unbelievers and the weak and unconsecrated ones in the\nchurch. These persons of two minds will ever have objections to\nthe plain, pointed testimony which reproves individual wrongs. In\nthis refining time these persons will either be wholly converted, and\n279\n280 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nsanctified by obeying the truth, or they will be left with the world,\nwhere they belong, to receive their reward with them.\n\u201cBy their fruits ye shall know them.\u201d All the followers of Christ[289]\nbear fruit to His glory. Their lives testify that a good work has been\nwrought in them by the Spirit of God, and their fruit is unto holiness.\nTheir lives are elevated and pure. Those who bear no fruit have no\nexperience in the things of God. They are not in the Vine. Read\nJohn 15:4, 5: \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear\nfruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye\nabide in Me. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in\nMe, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without\nMe ye can do nothing.\u201d\nIf we would be spiritual worshipers of Jesus Christ, we must\nsacrifice every idol and fully obey the first four commandments.\nMatthew 22:37, 38: \u201cJesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind. This is the first and great commandment.\u201d The first four\ncommandments allow no separation of the affections from God.\nNor is anything allowed to divide, or share, our supreme delight in\nHim. Whatever divides the affections, and takes away from the soul\nsupreme love to God, assumes the form of an idol. Our carnal hearts\nwould cling to our idols and seek to carry them along; but we cannot\nadvance until we put them away, for they separate us from God. The\ngreat Head of the church has chosen His people out of the world\nand requires them to be separate. He designs that the spirit of His\ncommandments shall draw them to Himself and separate them from\nthe elements of the world. To love God and keep His commandments\nis far from loving the world\u2019s pleasures and friendship. There is no\nconcord between Christ and Belial. The people of God may safely\ntrust in Him alone and without fear press on in the way of obedience.\nChapter 61\u2014Philosophy and Vain Deceit [290]\nI have been shown that we must be guarded on every side and\nperseveringly resist the insinuations and devices of Satan. He has\ntransformed himself into an angel of light and is deceiving thousands\nand leading them captive. The advantage he takes of the science of\nthe human mind, is tremendous. Here, serpentlike, he imperceptibly\ncreeps in to corrupt the work of God. The miracles and works of\nChrist he would make appear as the result of human skill and power.\nIf he should make an open, bold attack upon Christianity, it would\nbring the Christian in distress and agony to the feet of his Redeemer,\nand his strong and mighty Deliverer would put the bold adversary\nto flight. He therefore transforms himself into an angel of light and\nworks upon the mind to allure from the only safe and right path. The\nsciences of phrenology, psychology, and mesmerism are the channel\nthrough which he comes more directly to this generation and works\nwith that power which is to characterize his efforts near the close of\nprobation.\nRead 2 Thessalonians 2:8-12: \u201cAnd then shall that wicked be\nrevealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth,\nand shall destroy with the brightness of His coming: even him,\nwhose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs\nand lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in\nthem that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that\nthey might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them strong\ndelusion, that they should believe a lie: that they all might be damned\nwho believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\u201d\nSatan has come unperceived through these sciences and has\npoisoned the minds of thousands and led them to infidelity. He is\nwell pleased to have the knowledge of these sciences widespread.\nIt is a plan which he himself has laid that he may gain access to [291]\nminds and influence them as he pleases. While it is believed that\none human mind so wonderfully affects another, Satan, ready at\nhand, insinuates himself and works on the right hand and on the left.\n281\n282 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nAnd while those devoted to these sciences laud them to the heavens\nbecause of the great and good works they affirm are wrought by\nthem, they are cherishing and glorifying Satan himself, who steps\nin and works with all power and signs and lying wonders\u2014with\nall deceivableness of unrighteousness. Said the angel: \u201cMark its\ninfluence. The controversy between Christ and Satan is not yet\nended.\u201d This entering in of Satan through the sciences is well devised\nby his Satanic majesty, and in the minds of thousands will eventually\ndestroy true faith in Christ\u2019s being the Messiah, the Son of God.\nI was directed to the power of God manifested through Moses\nwhen the Lord sent him in before Pharaoh. Satan understood his\nbusiness and was upon the ground. He well knew that Moses was\nchosen of God to break the yoke of bondage upon the children of\nIsrael, and that in his work he prefigured Christ\u2019s first advent to break\nSatan\u2019s power over the human family and deliver those who were\nmade captives by his power. Satan knew that when Christ should\nappear, mighty works and miracles would be wrought by Him, that\nthe world might know that the Father had sent Him. He trembled\nfor his power. He consulted with his angels how to accomplish a\nwork which should answer a twofold purpose: 1. To destroy the\ninfluence of the work wrought by God through His servant Moses,\nby working through his agents, and thus counterfeiting the true work\nof God; 2. To exert an influence by his work through the magicians\nwhich would reach down through all ages and destroy in the minds\nof many true faith in the mighty miracles and works to be performed\nby Christ when He should come to this world. He knew that his\nkingdom would suffer, for the power which he held over mankind[292]\nwould be subject to Christ. It was no human influence or power\npossessed by Moses that produced those miracles wrought before\nPharaoh. It was the power of God. Those signs and wonders were\nwrought through Moses to convince Pharaoh that the great \u201cI AM\u201d\nsent him to command Pharaoh to let Israel go that they might serve\nHim.\nPharaoh called for the magicians to work with their enchant-\nments. They also showed signs and wonders, for Satan came to\ntheir aid to work through them. Yet even here the work of God was\nshown to be superior to the power of Satan, for the magicians could\nnot perform all those miracles which God wrought through Moses.\nPhilosophy and Vain Deceit 283\nOnly a few of them could they do. The magicians\u2019 rods did become\nserpents, [See Appendix.] but Aaron\u2019s rod swallowed them up. After\nthe magicians sought to produce the lice, and could not, they were\ncompelled by the power of God to acknowledge even to Pharaoh,\nsaying: \u201cThis is the finger of God.\u201d Satan wrought through the magi-\ncians in a manner calculated to harden the heart of the tyrant Pharaoh\nagainst the miraculous manifestations of God\u2019s power. Satan thought\nto stagger the faith of Moses and Aaron in the divine origin of their\nmission, and then his instruments, the magicians, would prevail.\nSatan was unwilling to have the people of Israel released from Egyp-\ntian servitude that they might serve God. The magicians failed to\nproduce the miracle of the lice, and could no more imitate Moses\nand Aaron. God would not suffer Satan to proceed further, and the\nmagicians could not save themselves from the plagues. \u201cAnd the\nmagicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the\nboil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.\u201d Exodus\n9:11.\nGod\u2019s controlling power here cut off the channel through which\nSatan worked, and caused even those through whom Satan had\nwrought so wonderfully to feel His wrath. Sufficient evidence was [293]\ngiven to Pharaoh to believe, if he would. Moses wrought by the\npower of God. The magicians wrought not by their own science\nalone, but by the power of their God, the devil, who ingeniously\ncarried out his deceptive work of counterfeiting the work of God.\nAs we near the close of time, the human mind is more readily\naffected by Satan\u2019s devices. He leads deceived mortals to account for\nthe works and miracles of Christ upon general principles. Satan has\never been ambitious to counterfeit the work of Christ and establish\nhis own power and claims. He does not generally do this openly\nand boldly. He is artful and knows that the most effectual way for\nhim to accomplish his work is to come to poor, fallen man in the\nform of an angel of light. Satan came to Christ in the wilderness\nin the form of a beautiful young man\u2014more like a monarch than a\nfallen angel\u2014with scripture in his mouth. Said he: \u201cIt is written.\u201d\nOur suffering Saviour met him with scripture, saying: \u201cIt is written.\u201d\nSatan took advantage of the weak, suffering condition of Christ, who\nhad taken upon Him our human nature.\n284 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nRead Matthew 4:8-11: \u201cAgain, the devil taketh Him up into an\nexceeding high mountain, and showeth Him all the kingdoms of the\nworld, and the glory of them; and saith unto Him, All these things\nwill I give Thee, if Thou wilt fall down and worship me. Then saith\nJesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt\nworship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve. Then the\ndevil leaveth Him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto\nHim.\u201d\nHere Satan spread the world before Christ in the most attrac-\ntive light and intimated to Him that He need not endure so much\nsuffering to obtain the kingdoms of the earth; Satan would yield\nall his claims if Christ would but worship him. Satan\u2019s dissatisfac-\ntion first commenced in heaven because he could not be first and\nhighest in command \u2014equal with God, exalted above Christ. He[294]\nrebelled and lost his estate; and he, and those who sympathized with\nhim, were turned out of heaven. In the wilderness he hoped to gain\nadvantage through the weak and suffering condition of Christ, and\nobtain from Him that homage which he could not obtain in heaven.\nBut Jesus, even in His faint and exhausted condition, yielded not to\nthe temptation of Satan for a moment, but showed His superiority\nand exercised His authority by bidding Satan: \u201cGet thee hence\u201d\u2014or,\nDepart from Me. Satan was baffled. He then studied how he could\naccomplish his purpose and receive the honor from the human race\nwhich was refused him in heaven and by Jesus upon earth. Could he\nhave succeeded in tempting Christ, then the plan of salvation would\nhave failed, and he would have succeeded in bringing hopeless mis-\nery upon mankind. But that which Satan failed to effect in coming\nto Christ he has accomplished in coming to man.\nIf Satan can so befog and deceive the human mind as to lead\nmortals to think that there is an inherent power in themselves to\naccomplish great and good works, they cease to rely upon God to\ndo for them that which they think there is power in themselves to\ndo. They acknowledge not a superior power. They give not God the\nglory which He claims, and which is due to His great and excellent\nMajesty. Satan\u2019s object is thus accomplished, and he exults that\nfallen men presumptuously exalt themselves as he exalted himself\nin heaven and was thrust out. He knows that if man exalts himself,\nhis ruin is just as certain as was his own.\nPhilosophy and Vain Deceit 285\nSatan failed in his temptations to Christ in the wilderness. The\nplan of salvation has been carried out. The dear price has been\npaid for man\u2019s redemption. And now Satan seeks to tear away\nthe foundation of the Christian\u2019s hope and turn the minds of men\ninto such a channel that they may not be benefited or saved by\nthe great sacrifice offered. He leads fallen man, through his \u201call\ndeceivableness of unrighteousness,\u201c to believe that he can do very [295]\nwell without an atonement, that he need not depend upon a crucified\nand risen Saviour, that man\u2019s own merits will entitle him to God\u2019s\nfavor. And then he destroys man\u2019s confidence in the Bible, well\nknowing that if he succeeds here, and faith in the detector which\nplaces a mark upon himself is destroyed, he is safe. He fastens\nupon minds the delusion that there is no personal devil, and those\nwho believe this make no effort to resist and war against that which\nthey think does not exist. Thus poor, blind mortals finally adopt\nthe maxim, \u201cWhatever is, is right.\u201d They acknowledge no rule to\nmeasure their course.\nSatan leads many to believe that prayer to God is useless and but a\nform. He well knows how needful are meditation and prayer to keep\nChrist\u2019s followers aroused to resist his cunning and deception. By\nhis devices he would divert the mind from these important exercises,\nthat the soul may not lean for help upon the Mighty One and obtain\nstrength from Him to resist his attacks. I was pointed to the fervent,\neffectual prayers of God\u2019s people anciently. \u201cElias was a man subject\nto like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly.\u201d Daniel prayed\nunto his God three times a day. Satan is enraged at the sound of\nfervent prayer, for he knows that he will suffer loss. Daniel was\npreferred above the presidents and the princes because an excellent\nspirit was in him. Fallen angels feared that his influence would\nweaken their control over the rulers of the kingdom, for Daniel was\nhigh in command. The accusing host of evil angels stirred up the\npresidents and princes to envy and jealousy, and they watched Daniel\nclosely to find some occasion against him that they might report him\nto the king; but they failed. Then these agents of Satan sought to\nmake his faithfulness to God the cause of his destruction. Evil angels\nlaid out the plan for them, and these agents readily carried it into\neffect.\nThe king was ignorant of the subtle mischief purposed against [296]\n286 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nDaniel. With full knowledge of the king\u2019s decree, Daniel still bows\nbefore his God, \u201chis windows being open.\u201d He considers supplication\nto God of so great importance that he would rather sacrifice his life\nthan relinquish it. On account of his praying to God, he is cast\ninto the lions\u2019 den. Evil angels thus far accomplish their purpose.\nBut Daniel continues to pray, even in the den of lions. Was he\nsuffered to be consumed? Did God forget him there? Oh, no; Jesus,\nthe mighty Commander of the hosts of heaven, sent His angel to\nclose the mouths of those hungry lions that they should not hurt the\npraying man of God; and all was peace in that terrible den. The\nking witnessed his preservation and brought him out with honors.\nSatan and his angels were defeated and enraged. The agents he had\nemployed were doomed to perish in the same terrible manner in\nwhich they had plotted to destroy Daniel.\nThe prayer of faith is the great strength of the Christian and will\nassuredly prevail against Satan. This is why he insinuates that we\nhave no need of prayer. The name of Jesus, our Advocate, he detests;\nand when we earnestly come to Him for help, Satan\u2019s host is alarmed.\nIt serves his purpose well if we neglect the exercise of prayer, for\nthen his lying wonders are more readily received. That which he\nfailed to accomplish in tempting Christ, he accomplishes by setting\nhis deceitful temptations before man. He sometimes comes in the\nform of a lovely young person, or of a beautiful shadow. He works\ncures, and is worshiped by deceived mortals as a benefactor of our\nrace. Phrenology and mesmerism are very much exalted. They are\ngood in their place, but they are seized upon by Satan as his most\npowerful agents to deceive and destroy souls. His arts and devices\nare received as from heaven, and faith in the detector, the Bible, is\ndestroyed in the minds of thousands. Satan here receives the worship\nwhich suits his Satanic majesty. Thousands are conversing with, and\nreceiving instructions from, this demon-God and acting according[297]\nto his teachings. The world which is supposed to be benefited so\nmuch by phrenology and animal magnetism, never was so corrupt.\nSatan uses these very things to destroy virtue and lay the foundation\nof spiritualism.\nI was directed to this scripture as especially applying to mod-\nern spiritualism: Colossians 2:8: \u201cBeware lest any man spoil you\nthrough philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after\nPhilosophy and Vain Deceit 287\nthe rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\u201d Thousands, I was\nshown, have been spoiled through the philosophy of phrenology\nand animal magnetism, and have been driven into infidelity. If the\nmind commences to run in this channel, it is almost sure to lose its\nbalance and be controlled by a demon. \u201cVain deceit\u201d fills the minds\nof poor mortals. They think there is such power in themselves to\naccomplish great works that they realize no necessity of a higher\npower. Their principles and faith are \u201cafter the tradition of men,\nafter the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\u201d Jesus has not\ntaught them this philosophy. Nothing of the kind can be found in His\nteachings. He did not direct the minds of poor mortals to themselves,\nto a power which they possessed. He was ever directing their minds\nto God, the Creator of the universe, as the source of their strength\nand wisdom. Special warning is given in verse 18: \u201cLet no man\nbeguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping\nof angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly\npuffed up by his fleshly mind.\u201d\nThe teachers of spiritualism come in a pleasing, bewitching man-\nner to deceive you, and if you listen to their fables you are beguiled\nby the enemy of righteousness and will surely lose your reward.\nWhen once the fascinating influence of the archdeceiver overcomes\nyou, you are poisoned, and its deadly influence adulterates and de-\nstroys your faith in Christ\u2019s being the Son of God, and you cease to\nrely on the merits of His blood. Those deceived by this philosophy\nare beguiled of their reward through the deceptions of Satan. They [298]\nrely upon their own merits, exercise voluntary humility, are even\nwilling to make sacrifices, and debase themselves, and yield their\nminds to the belief of supreme nonsense, receiving the most absurd\nideas through those whom they believe to be their dead friends. Sa-\ntan has so blinded their eyes and perverted their judgment that they\nperceive not the evil; and they follow out the instructions purporting\nto be from their dead friends now angels in a higher sphere.\nSatan has chosen a most certain, fascinating delusion, one that is\ncalculated to take hold of the sympathies of those who have laid their\nloved ones in the grave. Evil angels assume the form of these loved\nones and relate incidents connected with their lives and perform acts\nwhich their friends performed while living. In this way they deceive\nand lead the relatives of the dead to believe that their deceased friends\n288 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nare angels hovering about them and communing with them. These\nthey regard with a certain idolatry, and what they may say has greater\ninfluence over them than the word of God. These evil angels, who\nassume to be dead friends, will either utterly reject God\u2019s word as\nidle tales, or, if it suit their purpose best, will select the vital portions\nwhich testify of Christ and point out the way to heaven, and change\nthe plain statements of the word of God to suit their own corrupt\nnature and ruin souls. With due attention to the word of God, all may\nbe convinced if they will of this soul-destroying delusion. The word\nof God declares in positive terms that \u201cthe dead know not anything.\u201d\nEcclesiastes 9:5, 6: \u201cFor the living know that they shall die: but the\ndead know not anything, neither have they any more a reward; for\nthe memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred,\nand their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion\nforever in anything that is done under the sun.\u201d\nDeceived mortals are worshiping evil angels, believing them[299]\nto be the spirits of their dead friends. The word of God expressly\ndeclares that the dead have no more a portion in anything done under\nthe sun. Spiritualists say that the dead know everything that is done\nunder the sun, that they communicate to their friends on earth, give\nvaluable information, and perform wonders. Psalm 115:17: \u201cThe\ndead praise not the Lord, neither any that go down into silence.\u201d Sa-\ntan, transformed into an angel of light, works with all deceivableness\nof unrighteousness. He who could take up the Son of God, who was\nmade a little lower than the angels, and place Him upon a pinnacle\nof the temple, and take Him up into an exceeding high mountain\nto present before Him the kingdoms of the world, can exercise his\npower upon the human family, who are far inferior in strength and\nwisdom to the Son of God, even after He had taken upon Himself\nman\u2019s nature.\nIn this degenerate age, Satan holds control over those who depart\nfrom the right and venture upon his ground. He exercises his power\nupon such in an alarming manner. I was directed to these words:\n\u201cIntruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up\nby his fleshly mind.\u201d Some, I was shown, gratify their curiosity and\ntamper with the devil. They have no real faith in spiritualism and\nwould start back with horror at the idea of being mediums. Yet they\nventure and place themselves in a position where Satan can exercise\nPhilosophy and Vain Deceit 289\nhis power upon them. Such do not mean to enter deep into this\nwork, but they know not what they are doing. They are venturing\non the devil\u2019s ground and are tempting him to control them. This\npowerful destroyer considers them his lawful prey and exercises his\npower upon them, and that against their will. When they wish to\ncontrol themselves they cannot. They yielded their minds to Satan,\nand he will not release his claims, but holds them captive. No power\ncan deliver the ensnared soul but the power of God in answer to the\nearnest prayers of His faithful followers.\nThe only safety now is to search for the truth as revealed in the [300]\nword of God, as for hid treasure. The subjects of the Sabbath, the\nnature of man, and the testimony of Jesus are the great and important\ntruths to be understood; these will prove as an anchor to hold God\u2019s\npeople in these perilous times. But the mass of mankind despise the\ntruths of God\u2019s word and prefer fables. 2 Thessalonians 2:10, 11:\n\u201cBecause they received not the love of the truth, that they might be\nsaved. And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that\nthey should believe a lie.\u201d\nThe most licentious and corrupt are highly flattered by these Sa-\ntanic spirits, which they believe to be the spirits of their dead friends,\nand they are vainly puffed up in their fleshly minds. Colossians 2:19:\n\u201cAnd not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and\nbands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth\nwith the increase of God,\u201d they deny Him who ministers strength to\nthe body, that every member may increase with the increase of God.\nVain philosophy. The members of the body are controlled by the\nhead. Spiritualists lay aside the Head and believe that all the mem-\nbers of the body must act themselves and that fixed laws will lead\nthem on in a state of progression to perfection without a head. John\n15:1, 2, 4-6: \u201cI am the True Vine, and My Father is the Husbandman.\nEvery branch in Me that beareth not fruit, He taketh away: and every\nbranch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it, that it may bring forth more\nfruit.\u201d \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of\nitself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in\nMe. I am the Vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in Me, and I\nin him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can\ndo nothing. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch,\n290 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,\nand they are burned.\u201d\nChrist is the source of our strength. He is the Vine, we are[301]\nthe branches. We must receive nourishment from the living Vine.\nDeprived of the strength and nourishment of that Vine, we are as\nmembers of the body without a head and are in the very position\nwhich Satan wishes us to be in, that he may control us as pleases\nhimself. He works \u201cwith all deceivableness of unrighteousness in\nthem that perish; because they received not the love of the truth,\nthat they might be saved. And for this cause God shall send them\nstrong delusion, that they should believe a lie.\u201d Spiritualism is a\nlie. It is founded upon the great original lie, \u201cYe shall not surely\ndie.\u201d Thousands cut off the Head, and the result is the members act\nwithout Jesus for their head, and another guides the body. Satan\ncontrols them.\nI was shown that Satan cannot control minds unless they are\nyielded to his control. Those who depart from the right are in serious\ndanger now. They separate themselves from God and from the\nwatchcare of His angels, and Satan, ever upon the watch to destroy\nsouls, begins to present to them his deceptions. Such are in the\nutmost peril; and if they see and try to resist the powers of darkness\nand to free themselves from Satan\u2019s snare, it is not an easy matter.\nThey have ventured on Satan\u2019s ground, and he claims them. He\nwill not hesitate to engage all his energies and call to his aid all his\nevil host to wrest a single human being from the hand of Christ.\nThose who have tempted the devil to tempt them will have to make\ndesperate efforts to free themselves from his power. But when they\nbegin to work for themselves, then angels of God whom they have\ngrieved will come to their rescue. Satan and his angels are unwilling\nto lose their prey. They contend and battle with the holy angels,\nand the conflict is severe. But if those who have erred continue to\nplead, and in deep humility confess their wrongs, angels who excel\nin strength will prevail and wrench them from the power of the evil\nangels.\nAs the curtain was lifted and I was shown the corruption of this[302]\nage, my heart sickened, my spirit nearly fainted within me. I saw that\nthe inhabitants of the earth were filling up the measure of the cup of\ntheir iniquity. God\u2019s anger is kindled and will be no more appeased\nPhilosophy and Vain Deceit 291\nuntil the sinners are destroyed out of the earth. Satan is Christ\u2019s\npersonal enemy. He is the originator and leader of every species\nof rebellion in heaven and earth. His rage increases; we do not\nrealize his power. If our eyes could be opened to discern the fallen\nangels at work with those who feel at ease and consider themselves\nsafe, we would not feel so secure. Evil angels are upon our track\nevery moment. We expect a readiness on the part of bad men to\nact as Satan suggests; but while our minds are unguarded against\nhis invisible agents, they assume new ground and work marvels and\nmiracles in our sight. Are we prepared to resist them by the word of\nGod, the only weapon we can use successfully?\nSome will be tempted to receive these wonders as from God.\nThe sick will be healed before us. Miracles will be performed in\nour sight. Are we prepared for the trial which awaits us when the\nlying wonders of Satan shall be more fully exhibited? Will not many\nsouls be ensnared and taken? By departing from the plain precepts\nand commandments of God, and giving heed to fables, the minds\nof many are preparing to receive these lying wonders. We must all\nnow seek to arm ourselves for the contest in which we must soon\nengage. Faith in God\u2019s word, prayerfully studied and practically\napplied, will be our shield from Satan\u2019s power and will bring us off\nconquerors through the blood of Christ.\n292 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber Eight\u2014Testimony for the Church [303]\nChapter 62\u2014Family Religion\nI have been shown the high and responsible position which God\u2019s\npeople should occupy. They are the salt of the earth and the light\nof the world, and they must walk even as Christ walked. They\nwill come up through great tribulation. The present is a time of\nwarfare and trial. Our Saviour says in Revelation 3:21: \u201cTo him\nthat overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I\nalso overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.\u201d The\nreward is not given to all who profess to be followers of Christ, but\nto those who overcome even as He overcame. We must study the\nlife of Christ and learn what it is to confess Him before the world.\nIn order to confess Christ, we must have Him to confess. No\none can truly confess Christ unless the mind and spirit of Christ are\nin him. If a form of godliness, or an acknowledgment of the truth,\nwere always a confession of Christ, we might say: Broad is the\nway that leadeth unto life, and many there be that find it. We must\nunderstand what it is to confess Christ and wherein we deny Him.\nIt is possible with our lips to confess Christ yet in our works deny\nHim. The fruits of the Spirit manifested in the life are a confession\nof Him. If we have forsaken all for Christ, our lives will be humble,\nour conversation heavenly, our conduct blameless. The powerful,\npurifying influence of truth in the soul, and the character of Christ[304]\nexemplified in the life, are a confession of Him. If the words of\neternal life are sown in our hearts, the fruit is righteousness and\npeace. We may deny Christ in our life by indulging love of ease or\nlove of self, by jesting and joking, and by seeking the honor of the\nworld. We may deny Him in our outward appearance by conformity\nto the world, by a proud look or costly apparel. Only by constant\nwatchfulness and persevering and almost unceasing prayer shall we\nbe able to exhibit in our life the character of Christ or the sanctifying\ninfluence of the truth. Many drive Christ from their families by an\nimpatient, passionate spirit. Such have something to overcome in\nthis respect.\n294\nFamily Religion 295\nThe present enfeebled condition of the human family was pre-\nsented before me. Every generation has been growing weaker, and\ndisease of every form afflicts the race. Thousands of poor mortals\nwith deformed, sickly bodies, shattered nerves, and gloomy minds\nare dragging out a miserable existence. Satan\u2019s power upon the hu-\nman family increases. If the Lord should not soon come and destroy\nhis power, the earth would erelong be depopulated.\nI was shown that Satan\u2019s power is especially exercised upon\nthe people of God. Many were presented before me in a doubting,\ndespairing condition. The infirmities of the body affect the mind.\nA cunning and powerful enemy attends our steps and employs his\nstrength and skill in trying to turn us out of the right way. And it\nis too often the case that the people of God are not on their watch,\ntherefore are ignorant of his devices. He works by means which will\nbest conceal himself from view, and he often gains his object.\nBrethren have invested means in patent rights and other enter-\nprises, and have induced others to interest themselves, who could\nnot bear the perplexity and care of such business. Their anxious,\novertaxed minds seriously affect their already diseased bodies, and\nthey then yield to despondency, which increases to despair. They [305]\nlose all confidence in themselves and think that God has forsaken\nthem, and they dare not believe that He will be merciful to them.\nThese poor souls will not be left to the control of Satan. They will\nmake their way through the gloom and again fasten their trembling\nfaith upon the promises of God; He will deliver them and turn their\nsorrow and mourning into peace and gladness. But such, I was\nshown, must learn by the things they suffer to let patent rights and\nthese various enterprises alone. They should not allow even their\nbrethren to flatter them to entangle themselves in such enterprises,\nfor their anticipations will not be realized, and then they will be\nthrown upon the enemy\u2019s battlefield unarmed for the conflict. Means\nwhich should be put into the treasury of God to advance His cause\nis worse than lost by being invested in some of these modern im-\nprovements. If any who profess the truth feel at liberty to engage,\nand capable of engaging, in these patent rights and inventions, they\nshould not go among their brethren and make that their field of oper-\nation, but go among unbelievers. Let not your name and profession\nas an Adventist decoy your brethren who wish to consecrate their\n296 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmeans to God. But go out into the world, and let that class invest\ntheir means who care not for the advancement of the cause of God.\nI was shown the necessity of opening the doors of our houses and\nhearts to the Lord. When we begin to work in earnest for ourselves\nand for our families, then we shall have help from God. I was shown\nthat merely observing the Sabbath and praying morning and evening\nare not positive evidences that we are Christians. These outward\nforms may all be strictly observed, and yet true godliness be lacking.\nTitus 2:14: \u201cWho gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us\nfrom all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous\nof good works .\u201d All who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers should[306]\nhave command of their own spirit, not allowing themselves to speak\nfretfully or impatiently. The husband and father should check that\nimpatient word he is about to utter. He should study the effect of his\nwords, lest they leave sadness and a blight.\nInfirmities and disease especially affect women. The happiness\nof the family depends much upon the wife and mother. If she is\nweak and nervous, and is suffered to be overtaxed with labor, the\nmind becomes depressed, for it sympathizes with the weariness of\nthe body; and then she too often meets with cold reserve from the\nhusband. If everything does not move off just as pleasantly as he\ncould wish, he blames the wife and mother. He is almost wholly\nunacquainted with her cares and burdens, and does not always know\nhow to sympathize with her. He does not realize that he is aiding\nthe great enemy in his work of tearing down. He should by faith\nin God lift up a standard against Satan; but he seems blinded to his\nown interest and hers. He treats her with indifference. He knows not\nwhat he is doing. He is working directly against his own happiness\nand is destroying the happiness of his family. The wife becomes\ndesponding and discouraged. Hope and cheerfulness are gone. She\ngoes her daily rounds mechanically because she sees that her work\nmust be done. Her lack of cheerfulness and courage is felt throughout\nthe family circle. There are many such miserable families all through\nthe ranks of Sabbathkeepers. Angels bear the shameful tidings to\nheaven, and the recording angel makes a record of it all.\nThe husband should manifest great interest in his family. Es-\npecially should he be very tender of the feelings of a feeble wife.\nHe can shut the door against much disease. Kind, cheerful, and\nFamily Religion 297\nencouraging words will prove more effective than the most healing\nmedicines. These will bring courage to the heart of the desponding\nand discouraged, and the happiness and sunshine brought into the\nfamily by kind acts and encouraging words will repay the effort [307]\ntenfold. The husband should remember that much of the burden of\ntraining his children rests upon the mother, that she has much to do\nwith molding their minds. This should call into exercise his tenderest\nfeelings, and with care should he lighten her burdens. He should\nencourage her to lean upon his large affections, and direct her mind\nto heaven, where there is strength and peace, and a final rest for the\nweary. He should not come to his home with a clouded brow, but\nshould with his presence bring sunlight into the family, and should\nencourage his wife to look up and believe in God. Unitedly they\ncan claim the promises of God and bring His rich blessing into the\nfamily. Unkindness, complaining, and anger shut Jesus from the\ndwelling. I saw that angels of God will flee from a house where\nthere are unpleasant words, fretfulness, and strife.\nI have also been shown that there is often a great failure on the\npart of the wife. She does not put forth strong efforts to control her\nown spirit and make home happy. There is often fretfulness and\nunnecessary complaining on her part. The husband comes home\nfrom his labor weary and perplexed, and meets a clouded brow\ninstead of cheerful, encouraging words. He is but human, and his\naffections become weaned from his wife, he loses the love of his\nhome, his pathway is darkened, and his courage destroyed. He\nyields his self-respect and that dignity which God requires him to\nmaintain. The husband is the head of the family, as Christ is the\nhead of the church; and any course which the wife may pursue to\nlessen his influence and lead him to come down from that dignified,\nresponsible position is displeasing to God. It is the duty of the\nwife to yield her wishes and will to her husband. Both should be\nyielding, but the word of God gives preference to the judgment of\nthe husband. And it will not detract from the dignity of the wife to\nyield to him whom she has chosen to be her counselor, adviser, and\nprotector. The husband should maintain his position in his family [308]\nwith all meekness, yet with decision. Some have asked the question,\nMust I be on my guard and feel a restraint upon me continually?\nI have been shown that we have a great work before us to search\n298 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nour own hearts, and watch ourselves with jealous care. We should\nlearn wherein we fail, and then guard ourselves upon that point. We\nmust have perfect control over our own spirit. \u201cIf any man offend\nnot in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the\nwhole body.\u201d The light that shines upon our path, the truth that\ncommends itself to our consciences, will condemn and destroy the\nsoul, or sanctify and transform it. We are living too near the close\nof probation to be content with a superficial work. The same grace\nwhich we have hitherto considered sufficient will not sustain us now.\nOur faith must be increased, and we must become more like Christ\nin conduct and disposition in order to endure, and successfully resist,\nthe temptations of Satan. The grace of God is sufficient for every\nfollower of Christ.\nOur efforts to resist the attacks of Satan must be earnest and\npersevering. He employs his strength and skill in trying to turn us\nout of the right way. He watches our going out and our coming\nin, that he may find opportunity to hurt or destroy us. He works\nmost successfully in darkness, injuring those who are ignorant of his\ndevices. He could not gain advantage if his method of attack were\nunderstood. The instruments he employs to effect his purposes, and\ntransmit his fiery darts, are often the members of our own families.\nThose we love may speak or act unguardedly, which may wound\nus deeply. It was not their intention to do this; but Satan magnifies\ntheir words and acts before the mind, and thus hurls a dart from\nhis quiver to pierce us. We brace ourselves to resist the one whom\nwe think has injured us, and by so doing we encourage Satan\u2019s\ntemptations. Instead of praying to God for strength to resist Satan,\nwe suffer our happiness to be marred by trying to stand for what we[309]\nterm \u201cour rights.\u201d Thus we allow Satan a double advantage. We act\nout our aggrieved feelings, and Satan uses us as his agents to wound\nand distress those who did not intend to injure us. The requirements\nof the husband may sometimes seem unreasonable to the wife, when\nif she should calmly, candidly take the second view of the matter, in\nas favorable a light for him as possible, she would see that to yield\nher own way and submit to his judgment, even if it conflicted with\nher feelings, would save them both from unhappiness and would\ngive them great victory over the temptations of Satan.\nFamily Religion 299\nI saw that the enemy will contend either for the usefulness or the\nlife of the godly, and will try to mar their peace as long as they live\nin this world. But his power is limited. He may cause the furnace\nto be heated, but Jesus and angels will watch the trusting Christian,\nthat nothing may be consumed but the dross. The fire kindled by\nSatan can have no power to destroy or hurt the true metal. It is\nimportant to close every door possible, against the entrance of Satan.\nIt is the privilege of every family so to live that Satan can take no\nadvantage of anything they may say or do, to tear one another down.\nEvery member of the family should bear in mind that all have just as\nmuch as they can do to resist our wily foe, and with earnest prayers\nand unyielding faith each must rely upon the merits of the blood of\nChrist and claim His saving strength.\nThe powers of darkness gather about the soul and shut Jesus from\nour sight, and at times we can only wait in sorrow and amazement\nuntil the cloud passes over. These seasons are sometimes terrible.\nHope seems to fail, and despair seizes upon us. In these dreadful\nhours we must learn to trust, to depend solely upon the merits of the\natonement, and in all our helpless unworthiness cast ourselves upon\nthe merits of the crucified and risen Saviour. We shall never perish [310]\nwhile we do this\u2014never! When light shines on our pathway, it is no\ngreat thing to be strong in the strength of grace. But to wait patiently\nin hope when clouds envelop us and all is dark, requires faith and\nsubmission which causes our will to be swallowed up in the will of\nGod. We are too quickly discouraged, and earnestly cry for the trial\nto be removed from us, when we should plead for patience to endure\nand grace to overcome.\nWithout faith it is impossible to please God. We can have the\nsalvation of God in our families, but we must believe for it, live for it,\nand have a continual, abiding faith and trust in God. We must subdue\na hasty temper and control our words, and in this we shall gain great\nvictories. Unless we control our words and temper, we are slaves to\nSatan. We are in subjection to him. He leads us captive. All jangling\nand unpleasant, impatient, fretful words are an offering presented\nto his Satanic majesty. And it is a costly offering, more costly than\nany sacrifice we can make for God, for it destroys the peace and\nhappiness of whole families, destroys health, and is eventually the\ncause of forfeiting an eternal life of happiness. The restraint which\n300 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nGod\u2019s word imposes upon us is for our own interest. It increases the\nhappiness of our families and of all around us. It refines our taste,\nsanctifies our judgment, and brings peace of mind, and, in the end,\neverlasting life. Under this holy restraint we shall increase in grace\nand humility, and it will become easy to speak right. The natural,\npassionate temper will be held in subjection. An indwelling Saviour\nwill strengthen us every hour. Ministering angels will linger in our\ndwellings and with joy carry heavenward the tidings of our advance\nin the divine life, and the recording angel will make a cheerful,\nhappy record.\nChapter 63\u2014Jealousy and Faultfinding [311]\nBrother G,\nAt ----- you asked me some questions of which I have been\nthinking much. From my conversation with you, I am convinced\nthat you do not realize the part you have acted and the wound you\nhave brought upon the cause of God. That which had been shown\nme in regard to you, came vividly before me, and I have compared\nthat which has been recently shown me with the testimony published\nin regard to you in Testimony No. 6, and I cannot see the least\napology for your course. Before you were a partaker in, and lent\nyour influence to, the late fanaticism in Wisconsin, you were not\nright in the sight of God.\nBrother G, if you had honestly followed the light, you would\nnever have pursued the course you have taken. You have willfully,\nstubbornly followed your own course, and relied on your own judg-\nment, refusing to be led. The Lord sent you help, but you refused\nto accept it. What more could heaven have done for you than has\nbeen done? When you have thought that others were more highly\nesteemed than yourself, you have felt dissatisfied and irritated, and\nhave been pettish and distant like a spoiled child. You have wished\nto be highly esteemed, but have taken a course to greatly lower\nyourself in the estimation of those whose approbation you desire.\nBefore your fanatical course you were jealous of those at Battle\nCreek, and have thrown out hints which would excite suspicion. You\nhave been jealous of my husband and myself, and have surmised\nevil. Envy and suspicion have been united. Under an appearance\nof conscientiousness you have suggested doubts in regard to the\nmovements of those who are bearing the burden of the work at Battle\nCreek, and have thrown out hints in regard to matters of which you\nwere wholly ignorant, and utterly incapable of judging rightly. The\nburden of matters there was not laid upon you. I was shown that God [312]\nwould not select a person with a mind constituted like yours, and lay\nheavy burdens upon him, and call him to fill the most responsible\n301\n302 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\npositions; for self-esteem would be so prominent that it would be\nruinous to himself and to God\u2019s people. Had you esteemed yourself\nless, you would have had less jealousy and suspicion.\nBrother G, had you fully united with the body, and stood in union\nand sympathy with those whom God has seen fit to place at the head\nof the work; had you accepted the gifts which God has placed in\nthe church, and committed yourself fully in regard to them; had you\nestablished yourself decidedly upon all points of present truth, and\ndrawn in even cords with those of experience in the cause, you and\nyours would have been perfectly free and safe from this delusion.\nYou would have had an anchor which would have held you. But\nyou have taken an indefinite position, fearing that you would gratify\nthose whose whole soul was in the work and cause of God. God\nrequires you to stand firmly, decidedly, upon the platform with your\nbrethren. God and holy angels were displeased with your course, and\nwould bear with your folly no longer. You were left to follow your\nown judgment which you had so highly esteemed, until you should\nwish to be taught, and without jealous, stubborn feelings, without\ncomplaining or censuring others, learn of those who have felt the\nburden and weight of the cause of God. You have been reaching out\nfor an original position of your own, seeking to lead out independent\nof the body, where you would be approved and exalted, until I saw\nthat God had given you up to manage and manifest that wisdom you\nthought superior to others, and you were left to your blind judgment\nto figure in the most unreasonable, foolish, wild fanaticism that ever\ncursed Wisconsin.\nAnd yet I was shown that you did not realize the influence of\nyour past course upon the cause, and your present position and duty\nin regard to that fanaticism. Instead of working with all your energy[313]\nto free yourself and counteract the influence you exerted, you came\nup out of all this excusing yourself and censuring those whom God\nsent to you, and ready to dictate, and even to suggest a plan whereby\nthe Lord might have arrested you by His servants pursuing some\ndifferent course from that which they did pursue. Your judgment was\nperverted by Satan\u2019s power, and while enshrouded in darkness you\nwere an incompetent judge of the best course to be pursued toward\nyou. If you knew just what course the servants of God ought to\npursue in order to help you, you knew enough to come out yourself.\nJealousy and Faultfinding 303\nGod gave you your choice, to be taught, to be instructed through\nHis servants in His own appointed way, or to go on, maintain your\nwillful course, and fall into bewildering fanaticism.\nYou chose to haveyour way. And now you have only yourself\nto blame. You profess to be a watchman on the walls of Zion, a\nshepherd to the flock, yet you saw the poor sheep torn and scattered\nand gave no warning. \u201cSon of man, I have made thee a watchman\nunto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at My mouth, and\ngive them warning from Me. When I say unto the wicked, Thou\nshalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to\nwarn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same\nwicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at\nthine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his\nwickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity;\nbut thou hast delivered thy soul.\u201d \u201cNevertheless if thou warn the\nrighteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he\nshall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy\nsoul.\u201d Ezekiel 3:17-19, 21.\nThe sin of those in Wisconsin who went into fanaticism rests\nmore heavily upon you, Brother G, than upon any other one. You\nwere an unfaithful watchman. You discerned not the evil, because\nyou were unfaithful. God sent His faithful watchmen who stood [314]\nin the light and could discern the evil to warn you and the erring\nflock. Had you then listened to the warning, a great amount of evil\nwould have been saved. Your influence would have been preserved.\nYou would have stood out of the way, that the testimony of the\nservants of God might reach the distracted flock. The erring would\nnot hear the voice of God through His chosen servants. They made\ntheir spirit strong against the warning of the watchmen sent to them,\nand strengthened themselves in their unreasonable, self-deceived\ncourse. The shepherd would not hear. He was offended because this\nfanaticism was handled so decidedly. He perceived not the danger.\nHe saw no haste in the matter. He had sufficient light to decide, but\nwas too willful and too suspicious of God\u2019s servants to yield to their\ntestimony.\nBrother G wished to wait until the fanaticism should develop,\nand it went on just as Satan would have it, until it did develop with\nterrible results. There were not reasonable, sensible manifestations\n304 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto characterize that work as being of God. The Lord\u2019s servants\nexecuted their mission, freed their garments from the blood of souls,\nand kept themselves clear of the cursed influence, while you bear the\nfearful weight of the sin of this woeful fanaticism. You have deeply\nregretted it, yet do not see your own wrongs in relation to it. You\ncensure and blame the weak, erring sheep for leading you out of the\nway. What is a watchman for, unless it be to watch for evil and give\nthe warning? What is a shepherd for, unless it be to watch for every\ndanger lest the sheep be harmed and destroyed by wolves? What\nexcuse could a shepherd plead for suffering the flock to stray from\nthe true pasture, and be torn and scattered and devoured by wolves?\nHow would an excuse stand made by the shepherd that the sheep led\nhim astray? They left the true pasture, and led him out of the way?\nSuch a plea would tell with force against that shepherd\u2019s ability to[315]\nwatch over the sheep. No more confidence could be placed in him\nas a faithful shepherd to care for the sheep, and bring them back as\nthey might stray from the right path.\nThe reproach resting upon the cause in regard to Sister A rests\nheavily upon you. You made much of her exercises and experience.\nShe was weak, yet could in a measure fill her place in her family\nand keep her children together; but she had been from her home but\na short time before her reason was dethroned. The backslidden state\nof the professed Sabbathkeepers in ----- led you to influence Sister\nA to leave her family who needed her care, and come to ----- that\nher influence might help the Sabbathkeepers there. An unhealthy\nexcitement marked her course. Some of the inexperienced were\ndeluded. The weak mind of Sister A was overtaxed, and disease\nfastened upon the brain. And the cause of God is deeply wounded\nand reproached on account of this. Brother A has been wronged;\nhe must now suffer under a living trouble, and his children must\nbe scattered. Those whose influence led to these sad consequences,\nhave a work to do to relieve the mind of Brother A, and by a faithful\nand full acknowledgment to him of the sin of the course pursued,\nand the wrong done him, counteract the evil as far as possible.\nHad you been standing in the counsel of God, acknowledging the\ngifts of His Spirit as occupying their proper place in the church; had\nyou been in heart and principle with theReview, established upon the\nstrong truths applicable for this time; had you been giving meat in\nJealousy and Faultfinding 305\ndue season to the people of God, your influence in ----- and vicinity\nwould have been very different. You would have had a pointed\ntestimony to bear in harmony with those who are leading out in this\ngreat work. Individual wrongs would have been reproved. Faithful\nlabor would have brought up the Sabbathkeepers there, so that they [316]\nwould not have been behind other churches. But they have almost\neverything to learn. You should have borne a pointed testimony,\nimpressing upon them the necessity of sacrificing, and all doing\na part to bear the burden of the cause. You should have brought\nthem up upon systematic benevolence, leading all to act a part and\nexert themselves to do something to advance the cause of truth. Your\nindefinite position, and leaving matters so loose and slack in ----- has\nhad a bad influence upon the cause there. The opposition you felt\nand talked out in regard to organization and the advance of God\u2019s\npeople, has borne fruit which can be seen in many places in northern\nWisconsin.\nIf you had been a prompt, thorough laborer, keeping pace with\nGod\u2019s opening providence, the fruit now manifested would be of an\naltogether different character. Souls would be decided somewhere,\neither wholly for or against the commandments of God and other\ntruths connected with the third angel\u2019s message. They would not be\nhanging on the skirts of Zion to weigh down those who would be\nright. But there has not been faithfulness manifested by you. Straight\nand thorough work has not been made. You have not encouraged\nin the church, by a pointed application of truth, the necessity of\neveryone practically, harmoniously carrying out his profession; and\nmany are not as willing to exert themselves to do something to\nadvance the truth, as they are to be gratified with listening to the\ntruth. They love the cause in word and profession, but not in deed\nand in truth.\nYour position has led many in and about ----- to think less highly\nof the Review than they otherwise would have done, and they have\nheld very lightly the truths found in it. Thus the Review failed to\nhave the influence upon them that God designed it should have. And\neveryone has followed his own course, and done that which seemed\nright in his own eyes; hence all are far upon the background, and\nunless there is a thorough work accomplished for them, they will be [317]\nweighed in the balance and found wanting.\n306 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI was shown that you seek to throw the result of your wrongs\nupon others, but as a watchman God holds you responsible. You\nhave most humble confessions to make in -----, -----, -----, and\nother places where your influence has been exerted in opposition to\nGod\u2019s servants. Brother and Sister B have been greatly injured by\nthis fanaticism. They have been embarrassed temporally as well as\nspiritually, and nearly ruined by this deception of Satan. Brother G,\nyou have run to great lengths in this sad fanaticism; your body has\nbeen affected as well as your mind, and you now seek to charge it all\nupon others. You have not a true sense of your position and course\nin the past. You are free to confess that which others have done, and\nthat which you did not do; but you have failed to confess that which\nyou did do.\nYour influence in ----- has been injurious. You were opposed to\norganization, and preached against it in an indefinite manner, not\nso boldly as some might have done, but you went just as far as you\ndared to go. In this way you have many times gratified your envious\nfeelings, and created distrust and uncertainty in the minds of many,\nwhen if you had come out openly, you would have been plainly\nunderstood and could have done but little mischief. When charged\nwith advocating sentiments contrary to the faith of the body, you\nwould not acknowledge it, but mystified your position, and made it\nappear that the brethren misunderstood you, when you know that\nthe charge was correct. As you now are, the church cannot depend\non you. When you manifest the fruits of an entire reform, and give\nevidence that you are converted, and have overcome your jealousy,\nthen God will again trust His flock to your care. But until you make\nthorough restitution, you will exert the best influence by staying at\nhome, and being \u201cnot slothful in business.\u201d\nBy your noncommittal position, and by your course in this fanati-[318]\ncism you have done more injury to the cause of God in Wisconsin\nthan you have done good in all your life. Our faith has been made\ndisgusting to unbelievers; a wound, an incurable wound, has been\ngiven to the cause of God, and yet many, with yourself, seem as-\ntonished that so much is said and made of this fanaticism. One evil\nseed sown takes root, grows rank, and bears fruit, and there is an\nabundant harvest. Evil flourishes and needs no culture while the\ngood seed sown needs to be watered, carefully tended, and contin-\nJealousy and Faultfinding 307\nually nourished, or the precious plants will die. Satan, evil angels,\nand wicked men are trying to root up and destroy the good, and it\nrequires the greatest vigilance, and the most constant care, to have it\nlive and flourish. An evil seed sown cannot be easily rooted out. It\nspreads, and springs up in every direction, to crush out the precious\nseed; and if left alone it will grow strong, and shut out the rays of\nthe sun from the precious plants, until they grow sickly and die.\nWe met your influence at -----. The division existing there would\nnot have been had you taken a right position, and received the word\nof the Lord through His servants. But this you would not do. God\u2019s\nservants had to deal plainly with your wrong course. Had they taken\nstronger ground, and been much more severe with the course you\nhad pursued, God would have approved them. It would have been\nbetter had you remained entirely away from -----, for every time\nGod\u2019s servants exposed that fanaticism, the reproof hit Brother G,\nand you shrank, felt abused, neglected, etc. You pursued your blind\ncourse among different families in -----; you labored for sympathy,\nand created opposition of feeling against Brethren C, D, and E. You\nfelt wrong, felt slighted; you talked and acted out your feelings, and\nthus created jealousy and distrust in many minds in regard to God\u2019s\nservants whom He had especially sent to you. Your course destroyed\nthe force of their testimony on some minds; but some felt thankful [319]\nthat light had come, and that Satan\u2019s snare was broken, and they had\nescaped. Others felt hard, and decided against the testimony borne,\nand there was a division in the body. You can take the responsibility\nof this. We have had to labor for the church in ----- with distress\nof spirit to do away the wrong influence and impressions you had\ncreated. You have a work to do there.\nI saw that some have been very jealous for you, fearing that you\nwould not be rightly dealt with, and not have justice done you by\nyour ministering brethren. Such should stand out of the way, and\nbe faithful to confess their own wrongs, and let all the censure and\nweight of your wrongs rest upon your own head. God designs that\nthey shall rest there until you thoroughly remove them by repen-\ntance and hearty confession. Those who have a perverted sympathy\nfor you cannot help you. Let them manifest zeal in repenting of\ntheir own backslidings, and leave you to stand for yourself. You\nhave been altogether out of the way, and unless you make thorough\n308 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwork, confess your wrongs without censuring your brethren, and are\nwilling to be instructed, you can have no part with God\u2019s people.\nYou have stood aloof from those upon whom God has laid the\nheavy burden of His work. While my husband already had the labor\nand burden which three men should have shared, you have injured\nhim by remarks and hints, and have helped others to bring burdens\nupon him. You must see this. You have had no special burden laid\nupon you, but have had time for reflection and study, rest and sleep,\nwhile my husband has been obliged to labor day after day, and often\nlong into the night, and sometimes when he did lie down to rest, he\ncould not sleep, but could only weep and groan for the cause of truth,\nand the injustice of his brethren toward him, whose whole interest\nand life was devoted to the cause.\nHe has had the care and responsibility of the business in the[320]\noffice, the care of the paper, and much care of the churches in\ndifferent states. And yet some of his ministering brethren have\nhelped to perplex and distress by their unwise course. You with\nsome others have looked upon Brother White as a business character,\nnot enjoying much religion. Such do not know him. Satan deceives\nmany in regard to him. God has seen fit to lay the burden of His\nwork upon him, to choose him to lead out in different enterprises,\nand He has selected one who is sensitive, and can sympathize with\nthe unfortunate; who is conscientious, and yet independent; who\nwill not cover sin, but will be quick to see and feel wrong, and\nto reprove it and give no place to it, even if he has to stand alone\nin consequence. This is why he suffers so keenly. His brethren\ngenerally know nothing of his burdens, and some care nothing about\nthem, but by their own unwise, crooked course add to his cares and\nperplexities. Heaven marks these things. Men who have no weight\nor burdens upon them, who can have hours of ease, with nothing in\nparticular to do, who can reflect, and study, and improve their minds,\ncan manifest great moderation. They see nothing to urge them to\nmanifest any special zeal, and are ready to spend hours in private\nconversation. Some look upon such as being the best and holiest\nmen on earth. But God sees not as man sees. God looks at the heart.\nThose who have such an easy position will be rewarded according\nto their works.\nJealousy and Faultfinding 309\nThe position occupied by my husband is not an enviable one.\nIt requires the closest attention, care, and mental labor. It requires\nthe exercise of sound judgment and wisdom. It requires self-denial,\na whole heart, and a firm will to push matters through. In that\nimportant position God will have a man to venture, to risk something;\nto move out firmly for the right, whatever may be the consequences;\nto battle against obstacles, and waver not, even though life be at\nstake.\nThe weight and responsibility of this work lead to great careful- [321]\nness, cause sleepless nights, and call forth earnest, fervent, agonizing\nprayer to God. The Lord has led my husband forward to take one\nresponsible position after another. Censure from his brethren wrings\nhis soul with anguish, yet he must not falter in the work. Fellow\nlaborers having an appearance of godliness oppose every advance\nwhich God leads him to make, and his precious time must be oc-\ncupied in traveling from place to place, laboring with distress of\nmind among the churches to undo what these professed brethren\nhave been doing. Poor mortals! They mistake matters; they have\nnot a true sense of what constitutes a Christian. Those who have\nbeen thrust out to bear a plain, pointed testimony, in the fear of God\nto reprove wrong, to labor with all their energies to build up God\u2019s\npeople, and to establish them upon important points of present truth,\nhave too often received censure instead of sympathy and help, while\nthose who, like yourself, have taken a noncommittal position, are\nthought to be devoted, and to have a mild spirit. God does not thus\nregard them. The forerunner of Christ\u2019s first advent was a very plain-\nspoken man. He rebuked sin, and called things by their right names.\nHe laid the ax at the root of the tree. He thus addressed one class of\nprofessed converts who came to be baptized of him in Jordan: \u201cO\ngeneration of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath\nto come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.... And\nnow also the ax is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree\nwhich bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the\nfire.\u201d\nIn this fearful time, just before Christ is to come the second time,\nGod\u2019s faithful preachers will have to bear a still more pointed testi-\nmony than was borne by John the Baptist. A responsible, important\n310 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwork is before them; and those who speak smooth things, God will\nnot acknowledge as His shepherds. A fearful woe is upon them.\nThis strange fanaticism in Wisconsin grew out of the false theory[322]\nof holiness, advocated by Brother K\u2014a holiness not dependent\nupon the third angel\u2019s message, but outside of present truth. Sister\nG received this false theory from him, carried it out herself, and\nzealously taught it to others. This nearly destroyed her love for\nthe sacred, important truths for this time, which, if she had loved\nand obeyed, would have proved an anchor to hold her upon the\nright foundation. But she, with many others, made this theory of\nholiness or consecration the one great thing, and the important truths\nof God\u2019s word were of but little consequence, \u201cif the heart was only\nright.\u201d And poor souls were left without an anchor, to be carried\nabout by feeling, and Satan came in and controlled minds and gave\nimpressions and feelings to suit himself. Reason and judgment were\ndespised, and the cause of God was cruelly reproached.\nThe fanaticism into which you have fallen should lead you and\nothers to investigate before deciding in regard to this appearance\nof consecration. Appearance is not positive evidence of Christian\ncharacter. You and others are afraid of receiving a little more censure\nthan is due you, and you look with earnestness upon a seeming error\nor wrong in others, or a neglect from them, and feel injured. You\nare too exacting. You have been wrong and have deceived yourself.\nIf others have misjudged you in some things, it is no more than\nmight be expected, considering the circumstances. You should, with\nthe deepest sorrow and humility, mourn your sad departure from\nthe right, which has given occasion for a variety of feelings and\nviews and expressions in regard to you; and if in every particular\nyou do not consider them correct, you must let them pass, and lay\nnot censure upon others. You must confess your faults without\ncensuring any other one, and cease complaining that your brethren\nhave neglected you. They have given you more attention than you\ndeserved, considering the position you have for years occupied. If\nyou could see these things as God regards them, you would ever[323]\ndespise the complaints you make, and would humble yourself under\nthe hand of God. \u201cBehold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to\nhearken than the fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft,\nand stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry.\u201d\nJealousy and Faultfinding 311\n* * * * *\nChapter 64\u2014Unity of Faith\nProfessed believers in and about ----- do not come up to the work,\nand practice the truths which they profess. A blighting influence is\nupon the cause in northern Wisconsin. If all had felt that attachment\nfor the Review which God designed they should, they would have\nbeen benefited and instructed by the truths it advocates. They would\nhave had a correct faith, a settled position upon the truth applicable\nfor this time, and would have been guarded and saved from this\nfanaticism. The sensibilities of many are blunted; false excitement\nhas destroyed their discernment and spiritual eyesight. It is of the\nhighest importance now for them to move understandingly, that\nSatan\u2019s object may not be fully accomplished in overthrowing those\nwhom he has had power to deceive.\nWhen those who have witnessed and experienced false exercises,\nare convinced of their mistake, then Satan takes advantage of their\nerror, and holds it constantly before them, to make them afraid of\nany spiritual exercise, and in this way he seeks to destroy their faith\nin true godliness. Because they were once deceived, they fear to\nmake any effort by earnest, fervent prayer to God for special aid\nand victory. Such must not let Satan gain his object, and drive\nthem to cold formality and unbelief. They must remember that the\nfoundation of God standeth sure. Let God be true, and every man\na liar. Their only safety is to plant their feet upon a firm platform,[324]\nto see and understand the third angel\u2019s message, to prize, love, and\nobey the truth.\nChrist is leading out a people, and bringing them into the unity\nof the faith, that they may be one, as He is one with the Father.\nDifferences of opinion must be yielded, that all may come into union\nwith the body, that they may have one mind and one judgment. 1\nCorinthians 1:10: \u201cNow I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our\nLord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be\nno divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in\nthe same mind and in the same judgment.\u201d Romans 15:5, 6: \u201cNow\n312\nUnity of Faith 313\nthe God of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded\none toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one\nmind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist.\u201d Philippians 2:2: \u201cFulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded,\nhaving the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.\u201d\nAll the people of God should have an interest in His cause. There\nhas been a lack of this interest among the brethren in Wisconsin.\nThere has also been a lack of energy. Some think it no sin to idle\naway their time, while others who love the precious cause of truth,\neconomize their time, and in the strength of God exert themselves\nand labor hard that their families may be made neat and comfortable,\nand they have something besides to invest in the cause, that they may\ndo their part to keep the work of God moving and lay up a treasure\nin heaven. One is not to be eased and others burdened. God requires\nthose who have health and strength of body, to do what they can, and\nuse their strength to His glory, for they are not their own. They are\naccountable to God for the use they make of their time and strength,\nwhich are granted them of Heaven.\nThe duty to help in the advancement of truth does not rest only\nupon the wealthy. All have a part to act. The man who has employed\nhis time and strength to accumulate property is accountable for the [325]\ndisposition he makes of that property. If one has health and strength,\nthat is his capital, and he must make a right use of it. If he spends\nhours in idleness and needless visiting and talking, he is slothful\nin business, which God\u2019s word forbids. Such have a work to do to\nprovide for their own families, and then lay by them in store for\ncharitable purposes as God has prospered them.\nWe are not placed in this world merely to care for ourselves, but\nwe are required to aid in the great work of salvation, thus imitating\nthe self-denying, self-sacrificing, useful life of Christ. Those who\nlove their own ease better than they love the truth of God, will not be\nanxious to use their time and strength wisely and well, that they may\nact a part in spreading the truth. Many of the young in Wisconsin\nhave not felt the weight of the cause or the necessity of their making\nany sacrifice to advance it. They can never gain strength until they\nchange their course and make special efforts to advance the truth,\nthat souls may be saved. Some deny themselves and manifest an\ninterest and have double labor, because of their untiring efforts to\n314 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nsustain the cause they love. They make the cause of God a part of\nthem; if it suffers, they suffer with it; when it prospers, they are\nhappy.\nProverbs 3:9, 10: \u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with\nthe first fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with\nplenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.\u201d Those who\nare slothful may quiet themselves with the thought that God requires\nnothing of them because they have no increase. This will be no\nexcuse for them; for if they had diligently employed their time, if\nthey had not been slothful in business, they would have had increase.\nHad they resolutely exerted themselves to earn something to cast\ninto the treasury of God, ways would be opened for them, and they\nwould have some increase to devote to the cause of God, and thus to\nlay up a treasure in heaven.\nChapter 65\u2014Northern Wisconsin [326]\nWhile in Roosevelt, New York, August 3, 1861, different\nchurches and families were presented before me. The different\ninfluences that have been exerted, and their discouraging results,\nwere shown me. Satan has used as agents individuals professing to\nbelieve a part of present truth, while they were warring against a part.\nSuch he can use more successfully than those who are at war with all\nour faith. His artful manner of bringing in error through partial be-\nlievers in the truth, has deceived many, and distracted and scattered\ntheir faith. This is the cause of the divisions in northern Wisconsin.\nSome receive a part of the message, and reject another portion. Some\naccept the Sabbath and reject the third angel\u2019s message; yet because\nthey have received the Sabbath they claim the fellowship of those\nwho believe all the present truth. Then they labor to bring others into\nthe same dark position with themselves. They are not responsible\nto anyone. They have an independent faith of their own. Such are\nallowed to have influence, when no place should be given to them,\nnotwithstanding their pretensions to honesty.\nHonest souls will see the straight chain of present truth. They\nwill see its harmonious connections, link after link uniting into a\ngreat whole, and will lay hold upon it. The present truth is not\ndifficult to be understood, and the people whom God is leading will\nbe united upon this broad, firm platform. He will not use individuals\nof different faith, opinions, and views, to scatter and divide. Heaven\nand holy angels are working to unite, to bring into the unity of the\nfaith, into the one body. Satan opposes this, and is determined to\nscatter, and divide, and bring in different sentiments, that the prayer\nof Christ may not be answered: \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but\nfor them also which shall believe on Me through their word; that\nthey all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that\nthey also may be one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou [327]\nhast sent Me.\u201d John 17:20, 21. Jesus designed that the faith of His\npeople should be one. If one goes forth preaching one thing, and\n315\n316 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nanother differing with him preaches something else, how can those\nwho believe through their word be one? There will be difference of\nsentiments.\nI saw that if God\u2019s people in Wisconsin would prosper, they must\ntake a decided position in regard to these things, and thereby cut\noff the influence of those who are causing distraction and division\nby teaching sentiments contrary to the body. Such are wandering\nstars. They seem to emit a little light; they profess and carry along a\nlittle truth, and thus deceive the inexperienced. Satan endows them\nwith his spirit, but God is not with them; His Spirit does not dwell in\nthem. Jesus prayed that His disciples might be one, as He is one with\nthe Father, \u201cthat the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d The\noneness and unity of God\u2019s truth-believing remnant people carries\npowerful conviction to the world that they have the truth, and are the\npeculiar, chosen people of God. This oneness and unity disconcerts\nthe enemy, and he is determined that it shall not exist. The present\ntruth, believed in the heart and exemplified in the life, makes God\u2019s\npeople one, and gives them a powerful influence.\nHad professed Sabbathkeepers in Wisconsin earnestly sought\nand labored to be in union with the prayer of Christ, to be one as He\nis one with the Father, Satan\u2019s work would have been defeated. If all\nhad sought to be in union with the body, the fanaticism which has\nbrought so deep a stain upon the cause of present truth in northern\nWisconsin would not have arisen; for it is the result of drawing off\nfrom the body, and seeking to have an original, independent faith,\nregardless of the faith of the body.\nIn the last vision given at Battle Creek I was shown that an[328]\nunwise course was taken at ----- in regard to the visions at the time\nof the organization of the church there. There were some in ----\n- who were God\u2019s children, and yet doubted the visions. Others\nhad no opposition, yet dared not take a decided stand in regard to\nthem. Some were skeptical, and they had sufficient cause to make\nthem so. The false visions and fanatical exercises, and the wretched\nfruits following, had an influence upon the cause in Wisconsin to\nmake minds jealous of everything bearing the name of visions. All\nthese things should have been taken into consideration, and wisdom\nexercised. There should be no trial or labor with those who have\nnever seen the individual having visions, and who have had no\nNorthern Wisconsin 317\npersonal knowledge of the influence of the visions. Such should\nnot be deprived of the benefits and privileges of the church, if their\nChristian course is otherwise correct, and they have formed a good\nChristian character.\nSome, I was shown, could receive the published visions, judging\nof the tree by its fruits. Others are like doubting Thomas; they cannot\nbelieve the published Testimonies, nor receive evidence through the\ntestimony of others; but must see and have the evidence for them-\nselves. Such must not be set aside, but long patience and brotherly\nlove should be exercised toward them until they find their position\nand become established for or against. If they fight against the\nvisions, of which they have no knowledge; if they carry their oppo-\nsition so far as to oppose that in which they have had no experience,\nand feel annoyed when those who believe that the visions are of\nGod speak of them in meeting, and comfort themselves with the\ninstruction given through vision, the church may know that they\nare not right. God\u2019s people should not cringe and yield, and give\nup their liberty to such disaffected ones. God has placed the gifts\nin the church that the church may be benefited by them; and when\nprofessed believers in the truth oppose these gifts, and fight against\nthe visions, souls are in danger through their influence, and it is time [329]\nthen to labor with them, that the weak may not be led astray by their\ninfluence.\nIt has been very hard for the servants of God to labor in -----, for\nthere has been a class of self-righteous, talkative, unruly ones there,\nwho have stood in the way of the work of God. If received into the\nchurch, they would tear it to pieces. They would not be subject to\nthe body, and would never be satisfied unless the reins of church\ngovernment were in their own hands.\nBrother G sought to move with great caution. He knew that\nthe class who opposed the visions were wrong, that they were not\ngenuine believers in the truth; and therefore, to shake off these clogs,\nhe proposed to receive none into the church who did not believe the\nthird angel\u2019s message and the visions. This kept out some few pre-\ncious souls who had not fought against the visions. They dared not\nunite with the church, fearing that they should commit themselves\nupon that which they did not understand and fully believe. And\nthere were those at hand ready to prejudice these conscientious ones,\n318 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand to place matters before them in the worst possible light. Some\nhave felt grieved and offended because of the condition of member-\nship, and since the organization their feelings of dissatisfaction have\ngreatly increased. Strong prejudice has governed them.\nI was shown the case of Sister H. She was presented before me\nin connection with a professed sister who was strongly prejudiced\nagainst my husband and myself, and opposed to the visions. This\nspirit had led her to love and cherish every lying report in regard to\nus and the visions, and she has communicated this to Sister H. She\nhas had a bitter spirit of war against me, when she had no personal\nknowledge of me. She was unacquainted with my labors, yet has\nnourished the most wicked feelings of prejudice against me, and\nhas influenced Sister H, and they have united together in their bitter\nremarks and speeches. The person shown me in connection with[330]\nSister H was a strong-minded woman, sanguine, and exalted in her\nown estimation. She has thought that her views were correct, and\nthat others must rely upon her word, when she only darkened counsel\nby words, and manifested the spirit of the dragon host to war against\nthose who would be united on the commandments of God and the\ntestimony of Jesus.\nSince Sister H has been at -----, she has despised the visions,\nand has related hearsay reports, as though she knew that they were\ntrue. She has resisted no influence calculated to injure me. She\ndid not know but that the visions were of God; she had no personal\nacquaintance with the humble instrument; and yet she has united\nwith unconsecrated ones in ----- to exert a strong influence against\nme. They have strengthened one another by loving and reporting\nfalse stories coming from different sources, and in this way have\nnourished their prejudice. There can be no union between their spirit\nand the spirit of the messages which the Lord sees fit to give for the\nbenefit of His humble people. The spirit which dwells in their hearts\ncannot harmonize with the light given of God.\nMany poor souls do not know what they are doing. They unite\ntheir influence with Satan\u2019s forces, and aid him in his work. They\nmanifest great zeal and earnestness in their blind opposition, as\nthough they were verily doing God\u2019s service by fighting against the\nvisions. All who desire to do so can acquaint themselves with the\nfruits of these visions. For seventeen years God has seen fit to let\nNorthern Wisconsin 319\nthem survive and strengthen against the opposition of Satan\u2019s forces,\nand the influence of human agencies that have aided Satan in his\nwork.\nOther women were shown me in ----- who were at war with the\ntruth. One was presented before me who embraced a few points\nof truth, and then went no further with God\u2019s remnant people. She\nwas exalted in her own eyes, and thought she understood it all. She [331]\nwas wise in her own opinion, and was shown me as constantly\nlooking back and referring to an old experience; because she had\nreceived a degree of light in the past, she had become lifted up, and\nthought she had sufficient light and knowledge to instruct the whole\nbody. Her faith is scattered and disconnected. Many of her ideas\nof truth are erroneous; yet she is egotistical, and righteous in her\nown estimation. She is forward to instruct, but will not be taught.\nShe has despised instruction, and cast behind her the teachings of\nGod through His servants. I saw her pointing to her righteousness,\nher devotion, her prayerful life. Like the Pharisee, she enumerates\nher good deeds. \u201cGod, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men\nare, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast\ntwice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.\u201d The Pharisee\u2019s\nprayer was not regarded; but the poor publican, who could only say,\n\u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner,\u201d moved the pity of the Lord. His\nprayer was accepted, while the prayer of the boasting Pharisee was\nrejected. \u201cFor everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he\nthat humbleth himself shall be exalted.\u201d\nRevelation 3:17, 18: \u201cBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and in-\ncreased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that\nthou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:\nI counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest\nbe rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the\nshame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with\neyesalve, that thou mayest see.\u201d\nThis person, whose countenance I recognized when I saw her,\nI was told was Mrs. I. I saw that her life was not marked with\nthat humility which should ever characterize the followers of Christ.\nWhen poor mortals, however high their profession, become just in\ntheir own eyes, then Jesus leaves them to be deceived in regard to\nthemselves. I was shown that this woman has influenced others, and [332]\n320 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nsome have united with her to hold up the visions in a ridiculous light.\nTo God they must answer for all this; for every word of derision\nagainst the light which God has seen fit to communicate in His own\nchosen way, is recorded.\nI was shown still another woman who is not in union with the\npeople whom God is leading out. The spirit of truth dwells not in\nher heart, and she has been busy doing the work which well pleases\nthe enemy of all good, to distract and confuse minds. (I recognized\nthis woman the last day of the meeting; she left before it closed.)\nShe is a great talker, and is ever ready to hear and tell some new\nthing, dwelling upon what she calls others\u2019 wrongs; and she terms\nher evil surmisings discernment. She puts light for darkness, and\ndarkness for light, and for a pretense makes long prayers. She loves\nto be approved and thought righteous, and has deceived some. She\nwishes to teach others, and thinks that God teaches her above others.\nBut the truth has no place in her heart.\nA few others were shown me as joining their influence with\nthose I have mentioned, and together they do what they can to draw\noff from the body and cause confusion; and their influence brings\nthe truth of God into disrepute. Jesus and holy angels are bringing\nup and uniting God\u2019s people into one faith, that they may all have\none mind and one judgment. And while they are being brought into\nthe unity of the faith, to see eye to eye upon the solemn, important\ntruths for this time, Satan is at work to oppose their advancement.\nJesus is at work through His instruments to gather and unite. Satan\nworks through his instruments to scatter and divide. \u201cFor, lo, I will\ncommand, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like\nas corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the\nearth.\u201d\nGod is now testing and proving His people. Character is being\ndeveloped. Angels are weighing moral worth, and keeping a faithful[333]\nrecord of all the acts of the children of men. Among God\u2019s pro-\nfessed people are corrupt hearts; but they will be tested and proved.\nThat God who reads the hearts of everyone, will bring to light hid-\nden things of darkness where they are often least suspected, that\nstumbling blocks which have hindered the progress of truth may\nbe removed, and God have a clean and holy people to declare His\nstatutes and judgments.\nNorthern Wisconsin 321\nThe Captain of our salvation leads His people on step by step,\npurifying and fitting them for translation, and leaving in the rear\nthose who are disposed to draw off from the body, who are not\nwilling to be led, and are satisfied with their own righteousness.\n\u201cIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that\ndarkness!\u201d No greater delusion can deceive the human mind than\nthat which leads men to indulge a self-confident spirit, to believe\nthat they are right and in the light, when they are drawing away from\nGod\u2019s people, and their cherished light is darkness.\nThe class in ----- who have been drawing off from the body have\npossessed a hard, bitter spirit against those whom God is using as\nHis instruments to bring His people up united upon the only true\nplatform. Their spirit is opposed to the work of God, and their\ninfluence has brought reproach upon the cause of God, and has made\nour faith disgusting to unbelievers, and caused Satan to exult. Those\nwho are walking in church capacity and trying to serve God, may\nfor a time be annoyed with those among them who are not right, and\nwho have been shown me as self-righteous and pharisaical; but if\nthey are patient, and walk humbly before God, earnestly praying for\nHis power and Spirit, they will advance, and those who are unsound\nin the faith will be left behind.\nBrother J was presented before me, and I was shown that his\ncourse has not been pleasing to God. He was unstable. He has\nbeen befogged with the Age-to-Come, and as there is not the least [334]\nharmony between the Age-to-Come theory and the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, he lost his love for and faith in the message, and felt\nirritated because so much had been said in regard to it. The third\nangel is proclaiming a most solemn message to the inhabitants of\nthe earth; and shall God\u2019s chosen people be indifferent to it, and\nnot unite their voice to sound this solemn warning? Brother J is\ndeceived, and is deceiving others. His theme has been consecration,\nwhen his heart was not right. His mind has been divided. He has\nhad no anchor to hold him, and has been floating about without a\nsettled faith. Much of his time has been occupied in relating to one\nand another reports and stories calculated to distract and unsettle\nminds. He has had much to say in regard to my husband and myself,\nand against the visions. He has stood in a position, \u201cReport, ... and\nwe will report it.\u201d God sent him not on such a mission. He has not\n322 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nknown whom he has been serving. Satan has been using him to\nthrow minds into confusion. What little influence he had he has\nused to prejudice minds against the third angel\u2019s message. He has by\nfalse reports presented the visions in a wrong light, and weak souls\nwho were not established in all the present truth have fed upon these\nthings instead of clean provender thoroughly winnowed. He has\nbeen deceived in regard to sanctification. Unless he now changes his\ncourse, and is willing to be instructed, and cherishes the light given,\nhe will be left of God to pursue his own course and follow his own\nimperfect judgment until he will make shipwreck of faith, and by his\nunwise course become a signal warning to those who choose to go\nindependent of the body. God will open the eyes of honest souls to\nunderstand the cruel work of those who scatter and divide. He will\nmark those who cause divisions, that every honest one may escape\nfrom Satan\u2019s snare.\nBrother J received from Elder K a false theory of sanctification,\nwhich is outside of the third angel\u2019s message, and wherever received[335]\ndestroys the love for the message. I was shown that Elder K was\nupon dangerous ground. He is not in union with the third angel.\nHe once enjoyed the blessing of God, but does not now, for he has\nnot prized and cherished the light of truth which has shone upon\nhis pathway. He has brought along with him a theory of Methodist\nsanctification, and presents that in front, making it of the highest\nimportance. And the sacred truths applicable to this time are by\nhim made of little consequence. He has followed his own light,\nand been growing darker and darker, and going further and further\nfrom the truth, until it has but little influence upon him. Satan has\ncontrolled his mind, and he has done great injury to the cause of\ntruth in northern Wisconsin.\nIt was this theory of sanctification which Sister G received of\nElder K, and which she tried to follow out, that carried her into that\ndreadful fanaticism. Elder K has bewildered and confused many\nminds with this theory of sanctification. All who embrace it lose to\na great extent their interest in and love for the third angel\u2019s message.\nThis view of sanctification is a very pretty-looking theory. It white-\nwashes over poor souls who are in darkness, error, and pride. It gives\nthem an appearance of being good Christians, and of possessing ho-\nliness, when their hearts are corrupt. It is a peace-and-safety theory,\nNorthern Wisconsin 323\nwhich does not bring to light evil and reprove and rebuke wrong.\nIt heals the hurt of the daughter of God\u2019s people slightly, crying:\nPeace, peace, when there is no peace. Men and women of corrupt\nhearts throw around them the garb of sanctification, and are looked\nupon as examples to the flock, when they are Satan\u2019s agents, used by\nhim to allure and deceive honest souls into a bypath, that they may\nnot feel the force and importance of the solemn truths proclaimed\nby the third angel.\nElder K has been looked up to as an example, while he has been\nan injury to the cause of God. His life has not been blameless. His\nways have not been in accordance with the holy law of God, or with [336]\nthe spotless life of Christ. His corrupt nature is not subdued; and\nyet he dwells much upon sanctification, and thereby deceives many.\nI was directed to his past labors. He has failed to bring out souls\ninto the truth, and to establish them upon the third angel\u2019s message.\nHe presents a theory of sanctification as a matter of the utmost\nimportance, while he makes of but little importance the channel\nthrough which God\u2019s blessing comes. \u201cSanctify them through Thy\ntruth: Thy word is truth.\u201d The present truth, which is the channel,\nis not regarded, but is trampled underfoot. Men may cry, Holiness!\nholiness! sanctification! sanctification! consecration! consecration!\nand yet know no more by experience of what they talk than the\nsinner with his corrupt propensities. God will soon tear off this\nwhitewashed garb of professed sanctification which some who are\ncarnally minded have thrown around them to hide the deformity of\nthe soul.\nA faithful record is kept of the acts of the children of men.\nNothing can be concealed from the eye of the high and holy One.\nSome take a course directly opposed to the law of God, and then, to\ncover up their sinful course, they profess to be consecrated to God.\nThis profession of holiness does not make itself manifest in their\ndaily lives. It does not have a tendency to elevate their minds, and\nlead them to \u201cabstain from all appearance of evil.\u201d We are made\na spectacle unto the world, to angels, and to men. Our faith is\nblasphemed in consequence of the crooked course of the carnally\nminded. They profess a part of the truth, which gives them influence,\nwhile they have no union with those who believe and are united\nupon the whole truth. What has been Elder K\u2019s influence? What\n324 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhave been the fruits of his labors? How many have been brought out\nand established upon present truth? How many has he brought into\nthe unity of the faith? He has not gathered with Christ. His influence\nhas been to scatter. There is a lack in his preaching, and his converts[337]\nlack that which would prove their rock and defense in the day of\nGod\u2019s anger. His preaching lacks the salt, the savor. He does not\nbring out souls thoroughly converted to the truth, separating them\nfrom the world, and uniting them with God\u2019s peculiar people. His\nconverts have no anchor to hold them, and they drift here and there,\nuntil many of them are bewildered and lost in the world.\nElder K knows not of what spirit he is. He is uniting his influence\nwith the dragon host to oppose those who keep the commandments\nof God, and who have the testimony of Jesus. He has a hard warfare\nbefore him. As far as the Sabbath is concerned, he occupies the\nsame position as the Seventh Day Baptists. Separate the Sabbath\nfrom the messages, and it loses its power; but when connected with\nthe message of the third angel, a power attends it which convicts\nunbelievers and infidels, and brings them out with strength to stand,\nto live, grow, and flourish in the Lord. It is time for God\u2019s people\nin Wisconsin to find their position. \u201cWho will be on the Lord\u2019s\nside?\u201d should be sounded by the faithful, experienced ones in every\nplace. God requires them to come out and cut loose from the various\ninfluences which would separate them from one another and from\nthe great platform of truth upon which God is bringing His people.\nI was shown the case of Mr. L. He has much to say upon\nsanctification, but he is deceived in himself, and others are deceived\nin him. His sanctification may last him while he is in meeting, but\nit cannot bear the test. Bible holiness purifies the life; but L\u2019s heart\nis not cleansed. Evil exists in the heart, and is carried out in the\nlife, and the enemies of our faith have had occasion to reproach\nSabbathkeepers. They judge of the tree by its fruits.\n2 Corinthians 4:2: \u201cBut have renounced the hidden things of\ndishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God[338]\ndeceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves\nto every man\u2019s conscience in the sight of God.\u201d\nMany go directly contrary to the above scripture. They do walk\nin craftiness, and handle the word of God deceitfully. They do not\nexemplify the truth in their lives. They have special exercises upon\nNorthern Wisconsin 325\nsanctification, yet cast the word of God behind them. They pray\nsanctification, sing sanctification, and shout sanctification. Men\nwith corrupt hearts put on the air of innocence, and profess to be\nconsecrated; but this is no evidence that they are right. Their deeds\ntestify of them. Their consciences are seared, but the day of God\u2019s\nvisitation is coming, and every man\u2019s work shall be manifest, of\nwhat sort it is. And every man shall receive according to his deeds.\nSaid the angel, as he pointed to L: \u201cWhat hast thou to do to\ndeclare My statutes, or that thou shouldest take My covenant in thy\nmouth? seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest My words behind\nthee. When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and\nhast been partaker with adulterers. Thou givest thy mouth to evil,\nand thy tongue frameth deceit.\u201d God will scatter and shake off these\ndividing influences, and will free His people, if those professing the\nwhole truth will come up to the help of the Lord.\nThere is no Bible sanctification for those who cast a part of the\ntruth behind them. There is light enough given in the word of God,\nso that none need err. The truth is so elevated as to be admired by\nthe greatest minds, and yet it is so simple that the humblest, feeblest\nchild of God can comprehend it, and be instructed by it. Those who\nsee not the beauty that there is in the truth, who attach no importance\nto the third angel\u2019s message, will be without excuse; for the truth is\nplain.\n2 Corinthians 4:3, 4: \u201cBut if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them\nthat are lost: in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds\nof them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of [339]\nChrist, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.\u201d\nJohn 17:17, 19: \u201cSanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is\ntruth.\u201d \u201cAnd for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might\nbe sanctified through the truth.\u201d\n1 Peter 1:22: \u201cSeeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the\ntruth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see that\nye love one another with a pure heart fervently.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 7:1: \u201cHaving therefore these promises, dearly\nbeloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and\nspirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u201d\nPhilippians 2:12-15: \u201cWherefore, my beloved, as ye have always\nobeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my\n326 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nabsence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For\nit is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good\npleasure. Do all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye\nmay be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in\nthe midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine\nas lights in the world.\u201d\nJohn 15:3: \u201cNow ye are clean through the word which I have\nspoken unto you.\u201d\nEphesians 5:25-27: \u201cHusbands, love your wives, even as Christ\nalso loved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify\nand cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that He might\npresent it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle,\nor any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\u201d\nHere is Bible sanctification. It is not merely a show or outside\nwork. It is sanctification received through the channel of truth. It is\ntruth received in the heart, and practically carried out in the life.\nJesus, considered as a man, was perfect, yet He grew in grace.\nLuke 2:52: \u201cAnd Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor[340]\nwith God and man.\u201d Even the most perfect Christian may increase\ncontinually in the knowledge and love of God.\n2 Peter 3:14, 18: \u201cWherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for\nsuch things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, with-\nout spot, and blameless.\u201d \u201cBut grow in grace, and in the knowledge\nof our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now\nand forever. Amen.\u201d\nSanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, or a day. It\nis a continual growth in grace. We know not one day how strong\nwill be our conflict the next. Satan lives, and is active, and every day\nwe need to cry earnestly to God for help and strength to resist him.\nAs long as Satan reigns we shall have self to subdue, besetments to\novercome, and there is no stopping place, there is no point to which\nwe can come and say we have fully attained.\nPhilippians 3:12: \u201cNot as though I had already attained, either\nwere already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that\nfor which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.\u201d\nThe Christian life is constantly an onward march. Jesus sits as a\nrefiner and purifier of His people; and when His image is perfectly\nreflected in them, they are perfect and holy, and prepared for trans-\nNorthern Wisconsin 327\nlation. A great work is required of the Christian. We are exhorted to\ncleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting\nholiness in the fear of God. Here we see where the great labor rests.\nThere is a constant work for the Christian. Every branch in the\nparent vine must derive life and strength from that vine, in order to\nyield fruit.\nChapter 66\u2014The Power of Satan[341]\nFallen man is Satan\u2019s lawful captive. The mission of Christ was\nto rescue him from the power of his great adversary. Man is naturally\ninclined to follow Satan\u2019s suggestions, and he cannot successfully\nresist so terrible a foe unless Christ, the mighty Conqueror, dwells\nin him, guiding his desires, and giving him strength. God alone\ncan limit the power of Satan. He is going to and fro in the earth,\nand walking up and down in it. He is not off his watch for a single\nmoment, through fear of losing an opportunity to destroy souls.\nIt is important that God\u2019s people understand this, that they may\nescape his snares. Satan is preparing his deceptions, that in his last\ncampaign against the people of God they may not understand that\nit is he. 2 Corinthians 11:14: \u201cAnd no marvel; for Satan himself\nis transformed into an angel of light.\u201d While some deceived souls\nare advocating that he does not exist, he is taking them captive,\nand is working through them to a great extent. Satan knows better\nthan God\u2019s people the power that they can have over him when\ntheir strength is in Christ. When they humbly entreat the mighty\nConqueror for help, the weakest believer in the truth, relying firmly\nupon Christ, can successfully repulse Satan and all his host. He is\ntoo cunning to come openly, boldly, with his temptations; for then\nthe drowsy energies of the Christian would arouse, and he would rely\nupon the strong and mighty Deliverer. But he comes in unperceived,\nand works in disguise through the children of disobedience who\nprofess godliness.\nSatan will go to the extent of his power to harass, tempt, and\nmislead God\u2019s people. He who dared to face, and tempt, and taunt\nour Lord, and who had power to take Him in his arms and carry\nHim to a pinnacle of the temple, and up into an exceedingly high\nmountain, will exercise his power to a wonderful degree upon the[342]\npresent generation, who are far inferior in wisdom to their Lord, and\nwho are almost wholly ignorant of Satan\u2019s subtlety and strength.\nIn a marvelous manner will he affect the bodies of those who are\n328\nPower of Satan 329\nnaturally inclined to do his bidding. Satan exults that he is regarded\nas a fiction. When he is made light of, and represented by some\nchildish illustration, or as some animal, it suits him well. He is\nthought so inferior that the minds of men are wholly unprepared for\nhis wisely laid plans, and he almost always succeeds well. If his\npower and subtlety were understood, many would be prepared to\nsuccessfully resist him.\nAll should understand that Satan was once an exalted angel. His\nrebellion shut him out of heaven, but did not destroy his powers and\nmake him a beast. Since his fall he has turned his mighty strength\nagainst the government of heaven. He has been growing more artful,\nand has learned the most successful manner in which to come to the\nchildren of men with his temptations.\nSatan has originated fables with which to deceive. He com-\nmenced in heaven to war against the foundation of God\u2019s govern-\nment, and since his fall he has carried on his rebellion against the\nlaw of God, and has brought the mass of professed Christians to\ntrample under their feet the fourth commandment, which brings to\nview the living God. He has torn down the original Sabbath of the\nDecalogue, and substituted in its place one of the laboring days of\nthe week.\nThe great original lie which he told to Eve in Eden, \u201cYe shall not\nsurely die,\u201d was the first sermon ever preached on the immortality of\nthe soul. That sermon was crowned with success, and terrible results\nfollowed. He has brought minds to receive that sermon as truth, and\nministers preach it, sing it, and pray it.\nNo literal devil, and probation after the coming of Christ, are\nfast becoming popular fables. The Scriptures plainly declare that\nevery person\u2019s destiny is forever fixed at the coming of the Lord. [343]\nRevelation 22:11, 12: \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and\nhe which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let\nhim be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And,\nbehold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every\nman according as his work shall be.\u201d\nSatan has taken advantage of these popular fables to hide himself.\nHe comes to poor, deceived mortals through modern spiritualism,\nwhich places no bounds to the carnally minded, and, if carried out,\nseparates families, creates jealousy and hatred, and gives liberty to\n330 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe most degrading propensities. The world knows but little as yet\nof the corrupting influence of spiritualism. The curtain was lifted,\nand much of its dreadful work was revealed to me. I was shown\nsome who have had an experience in spiritualism, and have since\nrenounced it, who shudder as they reflect upon how near they came\nto utter ruin. They had lost control of themselves, and Satan made\nthem do that which they detested. But even they have but a faint idea\nof spiritualism as it is. Ministers inspired of Satan can eloquently\ndress up this hideous monster, hide its deformity, and make it appear\nbeautiful to many. But it comes so direct from his Satanic majesty,\nthat he claims the right to control all who have to do with it, for\nthey have ventured upon forbidden ground, and have forfeited the\nprotection of their Maker.\nSome poor souls who have been fascinated with the eloquent\nwords of the teachers of spiritualism, and have yielded to its influ-\nence, afterward find out its deadly character, and would renounce\nand flee from it, but cannot. Satan holds them by his power, and is\nnot willing to let them go free. He knows that they are surely his\nwhile he has them under his special control, but that if they once\nfree themselves from his power, he can never bring them again to\nbelieve in spiritualism, and to place themselves so directly under his\ncontrol. The only way for such poor souls to overcome Satan, is to[344]\ndiscern between pure Bible truth and fables. As they acknowledge\nthe claims of truth, they place themselves where they can be helped.\nThey should entreat those who have had a religious experience, and\nwho have faith in the promises of God, to plead with the mighty De-\nliverer in their behalf. It will be a close conflict. Satan will reinforce\nhis evil angels who have controlled these persons; but if the saints\nof God with deep humility fast and pray, their prayers will prevail.\nJesus will commission holy angels to resist Satan, and he will be\ndriven back and his power broken from off the afflicted ones. Mark\n9:29: \u201cAnd He said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,\nbut by prayer and fasting.\u201d\nThe popular ministry cannot successfully resist spiritualism.\nThey have nothing wherewith to shield their flocks from its bale-\nful influence. Much of the sad result of spiritualism will rest upon\nministers of this age; for they have trampled the truth under their\nfeet, and in its stead have preferred fables. The sermon which Satan\nPower of Satan 331\npreached to Eve upon the immortality of the soul\u2014\u201cYe shall not\nsurely die\u201d\u2014they have reiterated from the pulpit; and the people\nreceive it as pure Bible truth. It is the foundation of spiritualism.\nThe word of God nowhere teaches that the soul of man is immortal.\nImmortality is an attribute of God only. 1 Timothy 6:16: \u201cWho only\nhath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach\nunto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and\npower everlasting. Amen.\u201d\nGod\u2019s word, rightly understood and applied, is a safeguard\nagainst spiritualism. An eternally burning hell preached from the\npulpit, and kept before the people, does injustice to the benevolent\ncharacter of God. It presents Him as the veriest tyrant in the universe.\nThis widespread dogma has turned thousands to universalism, infi-\ndelity, and atheism. The word of God is plain. It is a straight chain of [345]\ntruth, and will prove an anchor to those who are willing to receive it,\neven if they have to sacrifice their cherished fables. It will save them\nfrom the terrible delusions of these perilous times. Satan has led the\nminds of the ministers of different churches to cling tenaciously to\ntheir popular errors, as he led the Jews in their blindness to cling to\ntheir sacrifices, and crucify Christ. The rejection of light and truth\nleaves men captives, the subjects of Satan\u2019s deception. The greater\nthe light they reject, the greater will be the power of deception and\ndarkness which will come upon them.\nI was shown that God\u2019s true people are the salt of the earth and\nthe light of the world. God requires of them continual advancement\nin the knowledge of the truth, and in the way of holiness. Then will\nthey understand the coming in of Satan, and in the strength of Jesus\nwill resist him. Satan will call to his aid legions of his angels to\noppose the advance of even one soul, and, if possible, wrest it from\nthe hand of Christ.\nI saw evil angels contending for souls, and angels of God re-\nsisting them. The conflict was severe. Evil angels were corrupting\nthe atmosphere with their poisonous influence, and crowding about\nthese souls to stupefy their sensibilities. Holy angels were anxiously\nwatching and waiting to drive back Satan\u2019s host. But it is not the\nwork of good angels to control the minds of men against their will.\nIf they yield to the enemy, and make no effort to resist him, then\nthe angels of God can do but little more than hold in check the host\n332 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof Satan, that they shall not destroy, until further light be given to\nthose in peril, to move them to arouse and look to heaven for help.\nJesus will not commission holy angels to extricate those who make\nno effort to help themselves.\nIf Satan sees that he is in danger of losing one soul, he will exert\nhimself to the utmost to keep that one. And when the individual is[346]\naroused to his danger, and, with distress and fervor, looks to Jesus\nfor strength, Satan fears that he will lose a captive, and he calls a\nreinforcement of his angels to hedge in the poor soul, and form a\nwall of darkness around him, that heaven\u2019s light may not reach him.\nBut if the one in danger perseveres, and in his helplessness casts\nhimself upon the merits of the blood of Christ, our Saviour listens\nto the earnest prayer of faith, and sends a reinforcement of those\nangels that excel in strength to deliver him. Satan cannot endure to\nhave his powerful rival appealed to, for he fears and trembles before\nHis strength and majesty. At the sound of fervent prayer, Satan\u2019s\nwhole host trembles. He continues to call legions of evil angels to\naccomplish his object. And when angels, all-powerful, clothed with\nthe armory of heaven, come to the help of the fainting, pursued soul,\nSatan and his host fall back, well knowing that their battle is lost.\nThe willing subjects of Satan are faithful, active, and united in one\nobject. And although they hate and war with one another, yet they\nimprove every opportunity to advance their common interest. But\nthe great Commander in heaven and earth has limited Satan\u2019s power.\nMy experience has been singular, and for years I have suffered\npeculiar trials of mind. The condition of God\u2019s people, and my\nconnection with the work of God, have often brought upon me a\nweight of sadness and discouragement which cannot be expressed.\nFor years I have looked to the grave as a sweet resting place. In\nmy last vision I inquired of my attending angel why I was left to\nsuffer such perplexity of mind, and was so often thrown upon Satan\u2019s\nbattleground. I entreated that if I must be so closely connected with\nthe cause of truth, I might be delivered from these severe trials.\nThere is power and strength with the angels of God, and I pleaded\nthat I might be shielded.\nThen our past life was presented before me, and I was shown\nthat Satan had sought in various ways to destroy our usefulness; that[347]\nmany times he had laid his plans to remove us from the work of\nPower of Satan 333\nGod; he had come in different ways, and through different agencies,\nto accomplish his purposes; but through the ministration of holy\nangels he had been defeated. I saw that in our journeying from\nplace to place, he had frequently placed his evil angels in our path\nto cause accidents which would destroy our lives; but holy angels\nwere sent upon the ground to deliver. Several accidents have placed\nmy husband and myself in great peril, and our preservation has been\nwonderful. I saw that we had been the special objects of Satan\u2019s\nattacks, because of our interest in and connection with the work of\nGod. As I saw the great care which God has every moment for those\nwho love and fear Him, I was inspired with confidence and trust in\nGod, and felt reproved for my lack of faith.\n* * * * *\nChapter 67\u2014The Two Crowns\nIn the vision given me at Battle Creek, Michigan, October 25,\n1861, I was shown this earth, dark and gloomy. Said the angel:\n\u201cLook carefully!\u201d Then I was shown the people upon the earth. Some\nwere surrounded by angels of God, others were in total darkness,\nsurrounded by evil angels. I saw an arm reached down from heaven,\nholding a golden scepter. On the top of the scepter was a crown\nstudded with diamonds. Every diamond emitted light, bright, clear,\nand beautiful. Inscribed upon the crown were these words: \u201cAll who\nwin me are happy, and shall have everlasting life.\u201d\nBelow this crown was another scepter, and upon this also was\nplaced a crown, in the center of which were jewels, gold, and silver,\nreflecting some light. The inscription upon the crown was: \u201cEarthly\ntreasure. Riches is power. All who win me have honor and fame.\u201d I\nsaw a vast multitude rushing forward to obtain this crown. They were\nclamorous. Some in their eagerness seemed bereft of reason. They[348]\nwould thrust one another, crowding back those who were weaker\nthan they, and trampling upon those who in their haste fell. Many\neagerly seized hold of the treasures within the crown, and held them\nfast. The heads of some were as white as silver, and their faces were\nfurrowed with care and anxiety. Their own relatives, bone of their\nbone, and flesh of their flesh, they regarded not; but, as appealing\nlooks were turned to them, they held their treasures more firmly, as\nthough fearful that in an unguarded moment they should lose a little,\nor be induced to divide with them. Their eager eyes would often\nfasten upon the earthly crown, and count and recount its treasures.\nImages of want and wretchedness appeared in that multitude, and\nlooked wishfully at the treasures there, and turned hopelessly away\nas the stronger overpowered and drove back the weaker. Yet they\ncould not give it up thus, but with a multitude of deformed, sickly,\nand aged, they sought to press their way to the earthly crown. Some\ndied in seeking to reach it. Others fell just in the act of taking hold\nof it. Many had but just laid hold of it when they fell. Dead bodies\n334\nTwo Crowns 335\nstrewed the ground, yet on rushed the multitude, trampling over the\nfallen and dead bodies of their companions. Everyone who reached\nthe crown possessed a share in it, and was loudly applauded by an\ninterested company standing around it.\nA large company of evil angels were very busy. Satan was in\nthe midst of them, and all looked with the most exulting satisfaction\nupon the company struggling for the crown. He seemed to throw\na peculiar charm upon those who eagerly sought it. Many who\nsought this earthly crown were professed Christians. Some of them\nseemed to have a little light. They would look wishfully upon the\nheavenly crown, and would often seem charmed with its beauty, yet\nthey had no true sense of its value and glory. While with one hand\nthey were reaching forth languidly for the heavenly, with the other [349]\nthey reached eagerly for the earthly, determined to possess that; and\nin their earnest pursuit for the earthly, they lost sight of the heavenly.\nThey were left in darkness, yet were anxiously groping about to\nsecure the earthly crown. Some became disgusted with the company\nwho sought it so eagerly; they seemed to have a sense of their danger,\nand turned from it, and earnestly sought for the heavenly crown. The\ncountenances of such soon changed from dark to light, from gloom\nto cheerfulness and holy joy.\nI then saw a company pressing through the crowd with their\neyes intently fixed upon the heavenly crown. As they earnestly\nurged their way through the disorderly crowd, angels attended them,\nand made room for them to advance. As they neared the heavenly\ncrown, the light emanating from it shone upon them and around\nthem, dispelling their darkness, and growing clearer and brighter,\nuntil they seemed to be transformed, and resembled the angels. They\ncast not one lingering look upon the earthly crown. Those who were\nin pursuit of the earthly, mocked them, and threw black balls after\nthem. These did them no injury while their eyes were fixed upon the\nheavenly crown, but those who turned their attention to the black\nballs were stained with them. The following scripture was presented\nbefore me:\nMatthew 6:19-24: \u201cLay not up for yourselves treasures upon\nearth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break\nthrough and steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,\nwhere neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not\n336 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbreak through nor steal: for where your treasure is, there will your\nheart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye\nbe single, thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be\nevil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light\nthat is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! No man can\nserve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other;[350]\nor else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve\nGod and mammon.\u201d\nThen that which I had seen was explained to me as follows: The\nmultitude who were so eagerly striving for the earthly crown, were\nthose who love this world\u2019s treasure, and are deceived and flattered\nwith its short-lived attractions. Some, I saw, who profess to be the\nfollowers of Jesus, are so ambitious to obtain earthly treasures that\nthey lose their love for heaven, act like the world, and are accounted\nof God as of the world. They profess to be seeking an immortal\ncrown, a treasure in the heavens; but their interest and principal study\nis to acquire earthly treasures. Those who have their treasures in this\nworld, and love their riches, cannot love Jesus. They may think that\nthey are right, and, although they cling to their possessions with a\nmiser\u2019s grasp, they cannot be made to see it, or to feel that they love\nmoney more than the cause of truth or the heavenly treasure.\n\u201cIf therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that\ndarkness!\u201d There was a point of time in the experience of such, when\nthe light given them was not cherished, and it became darkness. Said\nthe angel: \u201cYe cannot love and worship the treasures of earth, and\nhave the true riches.\u201d When the young man came to Jesus and said\nto Him, \u201cGood Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have\neternal life?\u201d Jesus gave him his choice, to part with his possessions\nand have eternal life, or retain them and lose it. His riches were\nof greater value to him than the heavenly treasure. The condition\nthat he must part with his treasures and give to the poor in order to\nbecome a follower of Christ and have eternal life, chilled his desire;\nand he went away sorrowful.\nThose who were shown me as clamorous for the earthly crown,\nwere those who will resort to any means to acquire property. They\nbecome insane upon that point. All their thoughts and energies are[351]\ndirected to the acquirement of earthly riches. They trample upon the\nrights of others, and oppress the poor, and the hireling in his wages.\nTwo Crowns 337\nIf they can take advantage of those who are poorer and less shrewd\nthan they, and thus manage to increase their riches, they will not\nhesitate a moment to oppress them, and even see them brought to\nbeggary.\nThe men whose heads were white with age, and whose faces\nwere furrowed with care, yet who were eagerly grasping the treasures\nwithin the crown, were the aged, who have but a few years before\nthem. Yet they were eager to secure their earthly treasures. The\nnearer they came to the grave, the more anxious they were to cling\nto them. Their own relatives were not benefited. The members of\ntheir own families were permitted to labor beyond their strength to\nsave a little money. They did not use it for others\u2019 good, or for their\nown. It was enough for them to know that they had it. When their\nduty to relieve the wants of the poor, and to sustain God\u2019s cause are\npresented before them, they are sorrowful. They would gladly accept\nthe gift of everlasting life, but are not willing that it should cost them\nanything. The conditions are too hard. But Abraham would not\nwithhold his only son. In obedience to God he could sacrifice this\nchild of promise more easily than many would sacrifice some of\ntheir earthly possessions.\nIt was painful to see those who should have been ripening for\nglory, and daily fitting for immortality, exerting all their strength\nto keep their earthly treasures. Such, I saw, could not value the\nheavenly treasure. Their strong affections for the earthly cause\nthem to show by their works that they do not esteem the heavenly\ninheritance enough to make any sacrifice for it. The \u201cyoung man\u201d\nmanifested a willingness to keep the commandments, yet our Lord\ntold him that he lacked one thing. He desired eternal life, but loved\nhis possessions more. Many are self-deceived. They have not sought\nfor truth as for hid treasures. Their powers are not put to the best [352]\naccount. Their minds, which might be illuminated with heaven\u2019s\nlight, are perplexed and troubled. \u201cThe cares of this world, and\nthe deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in,\nchoke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.\u201d \u201cSuch,\u201d said the angel,\n\u201care without excuse.\u201d I saw the light waning away from them. They\ndid not desire to understand the solemn, important truths for this\ntime, and thought they were well off without understanding them.\nTheir light went out, and they were groping in darkness.\n338 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThe multitude of deformed and sickly pressing for the earthly\ncrown are those whose interests and treasures are in this world.\nAlthough they are disappointed on every side, they will not place\ntheir affections on heaven, and secure to themselves a treasure and\nhome there. They fail of the earthly, yet while in pursuit of it, lose the\nheavenly. Notwithstanding the disappointment and unhappy life and\ndeath of those who were wholly bent upon obtaining earthly riches,\nothers follow the same course. They rush madly on, disregarding\nthe miserable end of those whose example they are following.\nThose who reached the crown, and possessed a share in it, and\nwere applauded, are those who obtain that which is the whole aim of\ntheir life\u2014riches. They receive that honor which the world bestows\nupon those who are rich. They have influence in the world. Satan\nand his evil angels are satisfied. They know that such are surely\ntheirs, that while they are living in rebellion against God, they are\nSatan\u2019s powerful agents.\nThe ones who became disgusted with the company clamoring\nfor the earthly crown are those who have marked the life and end\nof all who strive for earthly riches. They see that such are never\nsatisfied, but are unhappy, and they become alarmed, and separate\nthemselves from that unhappy class, and seek the true and durable\nriches.\nThose who are urging their way through the crowd for the heav-[353]\nenly crown, attended by holy angels, were shown me to be God\u2019s\nfaithful people. Angels lead them on, and they are inspired with zeal\nto press forward for the heavenly treasure.\nThe black balls which were thrown after the saints were the\nreproachful falsehoods put in circulation concerning God\u2019s people\nby those who love and make a lie. We should take the greatest care\nto live a blameless life, and abstain from all appearance of evil, and\nthen it is our duty to move boldly forward, and pay no regard to\nthe reproachful falsehoods of the wicked. While the eyes of the\nrighteous are fixed upon the heavenly priceless treasure, they will\nbecome more and more like Christ, and thus they will be transformed\nand fitted for translation.\n* * * * *\nChapter 68\u2014The Future\nAt the transfiguration, Jesus was glorified by His Father. We hear\nHim say: \u201cNow is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in\nHim.\u201d Thus before His betrayal and crucifixion He was strengthened\nfor His last dreadful sufferings. As the members of the body of\nChrist approach the period of their last conflict, \u201cthe time of Jacob\u2019s\ntrouble,\u201d they will grow up into Christ, and will partake largely of\nHis spirit. As the third message swells to a loud cry, and as great\npower and glory attend the closing work, the faithful people of God\nwill partake of that glory. It is the latter rain which revives and\nstrengthens them to pass through the time of trouble. Their faces\nwill shine with the glory of that light which attends the third angel.\nI saw that God will in a wonderful manner preserve His people\nthrough the time of trouble. As Jesus poured out His soul in agony\nin the garden, they will earnestly cry and agonize day and night for\ndeliverance. The decree will go forth that they must disregard the [354]\nSabbath of the fourth commandment, and honor the first day, or lose\ntheir lives; but they will not yield, and trample under their feet the\nSabbath of the Lord, and honor an institution of papacy. Satan\u2019s host\nand wicked men will surround them, and exult over them, because\nthere will seem to be no way of escape for them. But in the midst\nof their revelry and triumph, there is heard peal upon peal of the\nloudest thunder. The heavens have gathered blackness, and are only\nilluminated by the blazing light and terrible glory from heaven, as\nGod utters His voice from His holy habitation.\nThe foundations of the earth shake; buildings totter and fall with\na terrible crash. The sea boils like a pot, and the whole earth is in\nterrible commotion. The captivity of the righteous is turned, and\nwith sweet and solemn whisperings they say to one another: \u201cWe are\ndelivered. It is the voice of God.\u201d With solemn awe they listen to the\nwords of the voice. The wicked hear, but understand not the words\nof the voice of God. They fear and tremble, while the saints rejoice.\nSatan and his angels, and wicked men, who had been exulting that\n339\n340 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe people of God were in their power, that they might destroy them\nfrom off the earth, witness the glory conferred upon those who have\nhonored the holy law of God. They behold the faces of the righteous\nlighted up and reflecting the image of Jesus. Those who were so\neager to destroy the saints cannot endure the glory resting upon the\ndelivered ones, and they fall like dead men to the earth. Satan and\nevil angels flee from the presence of the saints glorified. Their power\nto annoy them is gone forever.\nNumber Nine\u2014Testimony for the Church [355]\nChapter 69\u2014The Rebellion\n[See Appendix]\nThe dreadful state of our nation calls for deep humility on the\npart of God\u2019s people. The one all-important inquiry which should\nnow engross the mind of everyone is: Am I prepared for the day of\nGod? Can I stand the trying test before me?\nI saw that God is purifying and proving His people. He will\nrefine them as gold, until the dross is consumed and His image is\nreflected in them. All have not that spirit of self-denial and that\nwillingness to endure hardness and to suffer for the truth\u2019s sake,\nwhich God requires. Their wills are not subdued; they have not\nconsecrated themselves wholly to God, seeking no greater pleasure\nthan to do His will. Ministers and people lack spirituality and true\ngodliness. Everything is to be shaken that can be shaken. God\u2019s\npeople will be brought into most trying positions, and all must be\nsettled, rooted, and grounded in the truth, or their steps will surely\nslide. If God comforts and nourishes the soul with His inspiring\npresence, they can endure, though the way may be dark and thorny.\nFor the darkness will soon pass away, and the true light shine forever.\nI was pointed to Isaiah 58:1-15; Jeremiah 14:10-12, as a description\nof the present state of our nation. The people of this nation have\nforsaken and forgotten God. They have chosen other Gods and\nfollowed their own corrupt ways until God has turned from them.[356]\nThe inhabitants of the earth have trampled upon the law of God and\nbroken His everlasting covenant.\nI was shown the excitement created among our people by the\narticle in the Review headed, \u201cThe Nation.\u201d Some understood it\none way, and some another. The plain statements were distorted,\nand made to mean what the writer did not intend. He gave the\nbest light that he then had. It was necessary that something be\nsaid. The attention of many was turned to Sabbathkeepers because\nthey manifested no greater interest in the war and did not volunteer.\n342\nRebellion 343\nIn some places they were looked upon as sympathizing with the\nRebellion. The time had come for our true sentiments in relation\nto slavery and the Rebellion to be made known. There was need of\nmoving with wisdom to turn away the suspicions excited against\nSabbathkeepers. We should act with great caution. \u201cIf it be possible,\nas much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.\u201d We can obey\nthis admonition, and not sacrifice one principle of our faith. Satan\nand his host are at war with commandment keepers, and will work\nto bring them into trying positions. They should not by lack of\ndiscretion bring themselves there.\nI was shown that some moved very indiscreetly in regard to\nthe article mentioned. It did not in all respects accord with their\nviews, and instead of calmly weighing the matter, and viewing it\nin all its bearings, they became agitated, excited, and some seized\nthe pen and jumped hastily at conclusions which would not bear\ninvestigation. Some were inconsistent and unreasonable. They did\nthat which Satan is ever hurrying them to do, namely, acted out their\nown rebellious feelings.\nIn Iowa they carried things to quite a length, and ran into fa-\nnaticism. They mistook zeal and fanaticism for conscientiousness.\nInstead of being guided by reason and sound judgment, they allowed [357]\ntheir feelings to take the lead. They were ready to become martyrs\nfor their faith. Did all this feeling lead them to God? to greater hu-\nmility before Him? Did it lead them to trust in His power to deliver\nthem from the trying position into which they might be brought?\nOh, no! Instead of making their petitions to the God of heaven and\nrelying solely upon His power, they petitioned the legislature and\nwere refused. They showed their weakness and exposed their lack of\nfaith. All this only served to bring that peculiar class, Sabbathkeep-\ners, into special notice, and expose them to be crowded into difficult\nplaces by those who have no sympathy for them.\nSome have been holding themselves ready to find fault and\ncomplain at any suggestion made. But few have had wisdom in this\nmost trying time to think without prejudice and candidly tell what\nshall be done. I saw that those who have been forward to talk so\ndecidedly about refusing to obey a draft do not understand what they\nare talking about. Should they really be drafted and, refusing to\nobey, be threatened with imprisonment, torture, or death, they would\n344 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nshrink and then find that they had not prepared themselves for such\nan emergency. They would not endure the trial of their faith. What\nthey thought to be faith was only fanatical presumption.\nThose who would be best prepared to sacrifice even life, if re-\nquired, rather than place themselves in a position where they could\nnot obey God, would have the least to say. They would make no\nboast. They would feel deeply and meditate much, and their earnest\nprayers would go up to heaven for wisdom to act and grace to endure.\nThose who feel that in the fear of God they cannot conscientiously\nengage in this war will be very quiet, and when interrogated will\nsimply state what they are obliged to say in order to answer the\ninquirer, and then let it be understood that they have no sympathy\nwith the Rebellion.\nThere are a few in the ranks of Sabbathkeepers who sympathize[358]\nwith the slaveholder. When they embraced the truth, they did not\nleave behind them all the errors they should have left. They need a\nmore thorough draft from the cleansing fountain of truth. Some have\nbrought along with them their old political prejudices, which are not\nin harmony with the principles of the truth. They maintain that the\nslave is the property of the master, and should not be taken from\nhim. They rank these slaves as cattle and say that it is wronging the\nowner just as much to deprive him of his slaves as to take away his\ncattle. I was shown that it mattered not how much the master had\npaid for human flesh and the souls of men; God gives him no title\nto human souls, and he has no right to hold them as his property.\nChrist died for the whole human family, whether white or black.\nGod has made man a free moral agent, whether white or black.\nThe institution of slavery does away with this and permits man to\nexercise over his fellow man a power which God has never granted\nhim, and which belongs alone to God. The slave master has dared\nassume the responsibility of God over his slave, and accordingly he\nwill be accountable for the sins, ignorance, and vice of the slave. He\nwill be called to an account for the power which he exercises over\nthe slave. The colored race are God\u2019s property. Their Maker alone\nis their master, and those who have dared chain down the body and\nthe soul of the slave, to keep him in degradation like the brutes, will\nhave their retribution. The wrath of God has slumbered, but it will\nawake and be poured out without mixture of mercy.\nRebellion 345\nSome have been so indiscreet as to talk out their pro-slavery\nprinciples\u2014principles which are not heaven-born, but proceed from\nthe dominion of Satan. These restless spirits talk and act in a manner\nto bring a reproach upon the cause of God. I will here give a copy [359]\nof a letter written to Brother A, of Oswego County, New York:\n\u201cI was shown some things in regard to you. I saw that you were\ndeceived in regard to yourself. You have given occasion for the\nenemies of our faith to blaspheme, and to reproach Sabbathkeepers.\nBy your indiscreet course, you have closed the ears of some who\nwould have listened to the truth. I saw that we should be as wise as\nserpents and as harmless as doves. You have manifested neither the\nwisdom of the serpent nor the harmlessness of the dove.\n\u201cSatan was the first great leader in rebellion. God is punishing\nthe North, that they have so long suffered the accursed sin of slavery\nto exist; for in the sight of heaven it is a sin of the darkest dye. God\nis not with the South, and He will punish them dreadfully in the end.\nSatan is the instigator of all rebellion. I saw that you, Brother A,\nhave permitted your political principles to destroy your judgment\nand your love for the truth. They are eating out true godliness from\nyour heart. You have never looked upon slavery in the right light,\nand your views of this matter have thrown you on the side of the\nRebellion, which was stirred up by Satan and his host. Your views\nof slavery cannot harmonize with the sacred, important truths for\nthis time. You must yield your views or the truth. Both cannot be\ncherished in the same heart, for they are at war with each other.\n\u201cSatan has been stirring you up. He would not let you rest until\nyou should express your sentiments upon the side of the powers of\ndarkness, thus strengthening the hands of the wicked, whom God\nhas cursed. You have cast your influence on the wrong side, with\nthose whose course of life is to sow thorns and plant misery for\nothers. I saw you casting your influence with a degraded company, a\nGodforsaken company; and angels of God fled from you in disgust.\nI saw that you were utterly deceived. Had you followed the light\nwhich God has given you, had you heeded the instructions of your [360]\nbrethren, had you listened to their advice, you would have saved\nyourself and saved the precious cause of truth from reproach. But\nnotwithstanding all the light given, you have given publicity to your\nsentiments. Unless you undo what you have done, it will be the duty\n346 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof God\u2019s people to publicly withdraw their sympathy and fellowship\nfrom you, in order to save the impression which must go out in\nregard to us as a people. We must let it be known that we have\nno such ones in our fellowship, that we will not walk with them in\nchurch capacity.\n\u201cYou have lost the sanctifying influence of the truth. You have\nlost your connection with the heavenly host. You have allied yourself\nwith the first great rebel, and God\u2019s wrath is upon you; for His sacred\ncause is reproached, and the truth is made disgusting to unbelievers.\nYou have grieved God\u2019s people, and despised the counsel of His\nambassadors upon earth, who labor together with Him, and are in\nChrist\u2019s stead beseeching souls to be reconciled to God.\n\u201cI was shown that as a people we cannot be too careful what\ninfluence we exert; we should watch every word. When we by word\nor act place ourselves upon the enemy\u2019s battle ground, we drive\nholy angels from us, and encourage and attract evil angels in crowds\naround us. This you have done, Brother A, and by your unguarded,\nwillful course have caused unbelievers to look upon Sabbathkeepers\nall around you with suspicion. These words were presented before\nme as referring to the servants of God: \u2018He that heareth you heareth\nMe; and he that despiseth you despiseth Me; and he that despiseth\nMe despiseth Him that sent Me.\u2019 May God help you, my deceived\nbrother, to see yourself as you are, and to have your sympathies with\nthe body.\u201d\nOur kingdom is not of this world. We are waiting for our Lord\nfrom heaven to come to earth to put down all authority and power,\nand set up His everlasting kingdom. Earthly powers are shaken. We[361]\nneed not, and cannot, expect union among the nations of the earth.\nOur position in the image of Nebuchadnezzar is represented by the\ntoes, in a divided state, and of a crumbling material, that will not\nhold together. Prophecy shows us that the great day of God is right\nupon us. It hasteth greatly.\nI saw that it is our duty in every case to obey the laws of our\nland, unless they conflict with the higher law which God spoke with\nan audible voice from Sinai, and afterward engraved on stone with\nHis own finger. \u201cI will put My laws into their mind, and write them\nin their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to\nMe a people.\u201d He who has God\u2019s law written in the heart will obey\nRebellion 347\nGod rather than men, and will sooner disobey all men than deviate\nin the least from the commandment of God. God\u2019s people, taught\nby the inspiration of truth, and led by a good conscience to live by\nevery word of God, will take His law, written in their hearts, as the\nonly authority which they can acknowledge or consent to obey. The\nwisdom and authority of the divine law are supreme.\nI was shown that God\u2019s people, who are His peculiar treasure,\ncannot engage in this perplexing war, for it is opposed to every\nprinciple of their faith. In the army they cannot obey the truth and at\nthe same time obey the requirements of their officers. There would\nbe a continual violation of conscience. Worldly men are governed by\nworldly principles. They can appreciate no other. Worldly policy and\npublic opinion comprise the principle of action that governs them\nand leads them to practice the form of rightdoing. But God\u2019s people\ncannot be governed by these motives. The words and commands\nof God, written in the soul, are spirit and life, and there is power\nin them to bring into subjection and enforce obedience. The ten\nprecepts of Jehovah are the foundation of all righteous and good\nlaws. Those who love God\u2019s commandments will conform to every\ngood law of the land. But if the requirements of the rulers are such [362]\nas conflict with the laws of God, the only question to be settled is:\nShall we obey God, or man?\nIn consequence of long-continued and progressive rebellion\nagainst the higher constitution and laws, a gloomy pall of dark-\nness and death is spread over the earth. The earth groans under\nthe burden of accumulated guilt, and everywhere dying mortals are\ncompelled to experience the wretchedness included in the wages of\nunrighteousness. I was shown that men have carried out the purposes\nof Satan by craft and deceit, and a dreadful blow has recently been\ngiven. It can be truly said: \u201cJustice standeth afar off: for truth is\nfallen in the street, and equity cannot enter,\u201d \u201cand he that departeth\nfrom evil maketh himself a prey.\u201d In some of the free states the\nstandard of morality is sinking lower and lower. Men with depraved\nappetites and corrupt lives have now an opportunity to triumph. They\nhave chosen for their rulers those whose principles are debasing,\nwho would not check evil, or repress the depraved appetites of men,\nbut let them have full sway. If those who choose to become like the\nbeasts, by drinking liquid poison, were the only sufferers; if they\n348 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nalone would reap the fruit of their own doings, then the evil would\nnot be so great. But many, very many, must pass through incredible\nsuffering on account of others\u2019 sins. Wives and children, although\ninnocent, must drain the bitter cup to its dregs.\nWithout the grace of God, men love to do evil. They walk in\ndarkness, and do not possess the power of self-control. They give\nloose rein to their passions and appetites until all the finer feelings\nare lost and only the animal passions are manifested. Such men need\nto feel a higher, controlling power, which will constrain them to\nobey. If rulers do not exercise a power to terrify the evildoer, he will\nsink to the level of the brute. The earth is growing more and more\ncorrupt.\nMany were blinded and grossly deceived in the last election, and[363]\ntheir influence was used to place in authority men who would wink\nat evil, men who would witness a flood of woe and misery unmoved,\nwhose principles are corrupt, who are Southern sympathizers, and\nwould preserve slavery as it is.\nIn positions of trust in the Northern army there are men who are\nrebels at heart, who value the life of a soldier no more than they\nwould the life of a dog. They can see them torn, and mangled, and\ndying, by thousands, unmoved. The officers of the Southern army\nare constantly receiving information in regard to the plans of the\nNorthern army. Correct information has been given to Northern\nofficers in regard to the movements and approach of rebels, which\nhas been disregarded and despised because the informer was black.\nAnd by neglecting to prepare for an attack, the Union forces have\nbeen surprised and nearly cut to pieces, or what is as bad, many\nof the poor soldiers have been taken prisoners to suffer worse than\ndeath.\nIf there were union in the Northern army, this Rebellion would\nsoon cease. Rebels know they have sympathizers all through the\nNorthern army. The pages of history are growing darker and still\ndarker. Loyal men, who have had no sympathy with the Rebellion,\nor with slavery which has caused it, have been imposed upon. Their\ninfluence has helped place in authority men to whose principles they\nwere opposed.\nEverything is preparing for the great day of God. Time will last\na little longer until the inhabitants of the earth have filled up the\nRebellion 349\ncup of their iniquity, and then the wrath of God, which has so long\nslumbered, will awake, and this land of light will drink the cup of\nHis unmingled wrath. The desolating power of God is upon the earth\nto rend and destroy. The inhabitants of the earth are appointed to the\nsword, to famine, and to pestilence.\nVery many men in authority, generals and officers, act in\nconformity with instructions communicated by spirits. The spir- [364]\nits of devils, professing to be dead warriors and skillful generals,\ncommunicate with men in authority and control many of their move-\nments. One general has directions from these spirits to make special\nmoves and is flattered with the hope of success. Another receives\ndirections which differ widely from those given to the first. Some-\ntimes those who follow the directions given obtain a victory, but\nmore frequently they meet with defeat.\nThe spirits sometimes give these leading men an account of\nevents to transpire in battles in which they are about to engage, and\nof individuals who will fall in the battle. Sometimes it is found\nto be as these spirits foretold, and this strengthens the faith of the\nbelievers in spiritual manifestations. And again it is found that\ncorrect information has not been given, but the deceiving spirits\nmake some explanation, which is received. The deception upon\nminds is so great that many fail to perceive the lying spirits which\nare leading them on to certain destruction.\nThe great leading rebel general, Satan, is acquainted with the\ntransactions of this war, and he directs his angels to assume the\nform of dead generals, to imitate their manners, and exhibit their\npeculiar traits of character. And leaders in the army really believe\nthat the spirits of their friends and of dead warriors, the fathers of\nthe Revolutionary War, are guiding them. If they were not under\nthe strongest fascinating deception, they would begin to think that\nthe warriors in heaven (?) did not manifest good and successful\ngeneralship, or had forgotten their famed earthly skill.\nInstead of the leading men in this war trusting in the God of\nIsrael, and directing their armies to trust in the only One who can\ndeliver them from their enemies, the majority inquire of the prince\nof devils and trust in him. Deuteronomy 32:16-22. Said the angel:\n\u201cHow can God prosper such a people? If they would look to and [365]\n350 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ntrust in Him; if they would only come where He could help them,\naccording to His own glory, He would readily do it.\u201d\nI saw that God would not give the Northern army wholly into\nthe hands of a rebellious people, to be utterly destroyed by their\nenemies. I was referred to Deuteronomy 32:26-30: \u201cI said, I would\nscatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them\nto cease from among men: were it not that I feared the wrath of the\nenemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely,\nand lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done\nall this. For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any\nunderstanding in them. Oh, that they were wise, that they understood\nthis, that they would consider their latter end! How should one chase\na thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had\nsold them, and the Lord had shut them up?\u201d\nThere are generals in the army who are wholly devoted and seek\nto do all they can to stop this dreadful Rebellion and unnatural war.\nBut most of the officers and leading men have a selfish purpose of\ntheir own to serve. Each is looking for gain from his own quarter,\nand many of the true, whole-hearted soldiers are becoming faint-\nhearted and discouraged. They nobly perform their part when in an\nengagement with the enemy, but the treatment which they receive\nfrom their own officers is brutal. Among the soldiers there are men\nthat have fine feelings and independence of spirit. They have never\nbeen accustomed to mingling with so degraded a class of men as war\nbrings together, and being tyrannized over and abused, and treated\nlike brutes. It is very hard for them to endure all this. Many officers\nhave brutal passions, and as they are placed in authority they have\ngood opportunity to act out their brutal natures. They tyrannize over\nthose under them as Southern masters tyrannize over their slaves.\nThese things will make it difficult to procure men for the army. [366]\nIn some cases when generals have been in most terrible conflict,\nwhere their men have fallen like rain, a reinforcement at the right\ntime would have given them a victory. But other generals cared\nnothing how many lives were lost, and rather than come to the help\nof those in an engagement, as though their interests were one, they\nwithheld the necessary aid, fearing that their brother general would\nreceive the honor of successfully repulsing the enemy. Through\nenvy and jealousy they have even exulted to see the enemy gain\nRebellion 351\nthe victory and repulse Union men. Southern men possess a hellish\nspirit in this Rebellion, but Northern men are not clear. Many of\nthem possess a selfish jealousy, fearing that others will obtain honors\nand be exalted above themselves. Oh, how many thousands of lives\nhave been sacrificed on this account! Those of other nations who\nhave conducted war have had but one interest. With a disinterested\nzeal they have moved on to conquer or to die. Leading men in the\nRevolution acted unitedly, with zeal, and by that means they gained\ntheir independence. But men now act like demons instead of human\nbeings.\nSatan has, through his angels, communicated with officers who\nwere cool, calculating men when left to themselves, and they have\ngiven up their own judgment and have been led by these lying spir-\nits into very difficult places, where they have been repulsed with\ndreadful slaughter. It suits his Satanic majesty well to see slaugh-\nter and carnage upon the earth. He loves to see the poor soldiers\nmowed down like grass. I saw that the rebels have often been in\npositions where they could have been subdued without much effort;\nbut the communications from spirits have led the Northern generals\nand blinded their eyes until the rebels were beyond their reach. And\nsome generals would rather allow the rebels to escape than to subdue\nthem. They think more of the darling institution of slavery than of [367]\nthe prosperity of the nation. These are among the reasons why the\nwar is so protracted.\nInformation sent by our generals to Washington concerning the\nmovement of our armies might nearly as well be telegraphed directly\nto the rebel forces. There are rebel sympathizers right at the heart of\nthe Union authorities. This war is unlike any other. The great lack\nof union of feeling and action makes it look dark and discouraging.\nMany of the soldiers have thrown off restraint and have sunk to an\nalarming state of degradation. How can God go forth with such a\ncorrupt army? How can He, according to His honor, defeat their\nenemies and lead them on to victory? There is discord, and strife\nfor honor, while the poor soldiers are dying by thousands on the\nbattlefield or from their wounds and from exposure and hardships.\nThis war is a most singular and at the same time a most horri-\nble and heartsickening conflict. Other nations are looking on with\ndisgust at the transactions of the armies of both North and South.\n352 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThey see such a determined effort to protract the war at an enormous\nsacrifice of life and money, while at the same time nothing is really\ngained, that it looks to them like a strife to see which can kill the\nmost men. They are indignant.\nI saw that the Rebellion had been steadily increasing and that it\nhad never been more determined than at the present moment. Many\nprofessed Union men, holding important positions, are disloyal at\nheart. Their only object in taking up arms was to preserve the Union\nas it was, and slavery with it. They would heartily chain down the\nslave to his life of galling bondage, had they the privilege. Such\nhave a strong degree of sympathy with the South. Blood has been\npoured out like water, and for nought. In every town and village\nthere is mourning. Wives are mourning for their husbands, mothers\nfor their sons, and sisters for their brothers. But notwithstanding all\nthis suffering, they do not turn to God.\nI saw that both the South and the North were being punished. In[368]\nregard to the South, I was referred to Deuteronomy 32:35-37: \u201cTo\nMe belongeth vengeance, and recompense; their foot shall slide in\ndue time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things\nthat shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge\nHis people, and repent Himself for His servants, when He seeth that\ntheir power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left. And He shall\nsay, Where are their Gods, their rock in whom they trusted?\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 70\u2014Dangers and Duty of Ministers\nI have been shown that more can now be accomplished by labor-\ning in places where a few have been raised up, than in entirely new\nfields, unless the opening is very good. A few in different towns who\nreally believe the truth will exert an influence and excite inquiry in\nregard to their faith; and if their lives are exemplary, their light will\nshine, and they will have a gathering influence. And yet I was shown\nplaces where the truth has not been proclaimed, which should be vis-\nited soon. But the great work now to be accomplished is to bring up\nthe people of God to engage in the work and exert a holy influence.\nThey should act the part of laborers. With wisdom, caution, and\nlove, they should labor for the salvation of neighbors and friends.\nThere is too distant a feeling manifested. The cross is not laid right\nhold of and borne as it should be. All should feel that they are their\nbrother\u2019s keeper, that they are in a great degree responsible for the\nsouls of those around them. The brethren err when they leave this\nwork all to the ministers. The harvest is great, and the laborers are\nfew. Those who are of good repute, whose lives are in accordance\nwith their faith, can be workmen. They can converse with others,\nand urge upon them the importance of the truth. They must not wait [369]\nfor the ministers and neglect a plain duty which God has left for\nthem to perform.\nSome of our ministers feel but little disposition to take upon\nthem the burden of the work of God and labor with that disinterested\nbenevolence which characterized the life of our divine Lord. The\nchurches, as a general rule, are farther advanced than some of the\nministers. They have had faith in the testimonies which God has\nbeen pleased to give, and have acted upon them, while some of\nthe preachers are far behind. They profess to believe the testimony\nborne, and some do harm by making them an iron rule for those who\nhave had no experience in reference to them, but they fail to carry\nthem out themselves. They have had repeated testimonies which\nthey have utterly disregarded. The course of such is not consistent.\n353\n354 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThe people of God generally feel a united interest in the spread\nof the truth. They cheerfully contribute toward a liberal support for\nthose who labor in word and doctrine. And I saw that it is the duty\nof those who have the responsibility of distributing means, to see\nthat the liberalities of the church are not squandered. Some of these\nliberal brethren have been laboring for years with shattered nerves\nand broken-down constitutions, caused by excessive labor in the past\nto obtain possessions here, and now as they freely give a portion of\nthe substance which has cost them so much, it is the duty of those\nwho labor in word and doctrine to manifest a zeal and self-sacrifice\nat least equal to that shown by these brethren.\nGod\u2019s servants must go out free. They must know in whom\nthey trust. There is power in Christ and His salvation to make them\nfree men; and unless they are free in Him, they cannot build up\nHis church and gather in souls. Will God send out a man to rescue\nsouls from the snare of Satan when his own feet are entangled in the\nnet? God\u2019s servants must not be wavering. If their feet are sliding,\nhow can they say to those of a fearful heart: \u201cBe strong\u201d? God[370]\nwould have His servants hold up the feeble hands, and strengthen the\nwavering. Those who are not prepared to do this would better first\nlabor for themselves and pray until they are endowed with power\nfrom on high.\nGod is displeased with the lack of self-denial in some of His\nservants. They have not the burden of the work upon them. They\nseem to be in a deathlike stupor. Angels of God stand amazed\nand ashamed of this lack of self-denial and perseverance. While\nthe Author of our salvation was laboring and suffering for us, He\ndenied Himself, and His whole life was one continued scene of toil\nand privation. He could have passed His days on earth in ease and\nplenty, and appropriated to Himself the pleasures of this life; but He\nconsidered not His own convenience. He lived to do others good.\nHe suffered to save others from suffering. He endured to the end\nand finished the work which was given Him to do. All this was to\nsave us from ruin. And now, can it be that we, the unworthy objects\nof so great love, will seek a better position in this life than was given\nto our Lord? Every moment of our lives we have been partakers of\nthe blessings of His great love, and for this very reason we cannot\nfully realize the depths of ignorance and misery from which we have\nDangers and Duty of Ministers 355\nbeen saved. Can we look upon Him whom our sins have pierced and\nnot be willing to drink with Him the bitter cup of humiliation and\nsorrow? Can we look upon Christ crucified and wish to enter His\nkingdom in any other way than through much tribulation?\nThe preachers are not all given up to the work of God, as He\nrequires them to be. Some have felt that the lot of a preacher was\nhard because they had to be separated from their families. They\nforget that once it was harder laboring than it is now. Once there\nwere but few friends of the cause. They forget those upon whom God\nlaid the burden of the work in the past. There were but a few then\nwho received the truth as the result of much labor. God\u2019s chosen [371]\nservants wept and prayed for a clear understanding of truth, and\nsuffered privation and much self-denial in order to carry it to others.\nStep by step they followed as God\u2019s opening providence led the way.\nThey did not study their own convenience or shrink at hardships.\nThrough these men God prepared the way and made the truth plain to\nthe understanding of every honest mind. Everything has been made\nready to the hands of ministers who have since embraced the truth,\nyet some of them have failed to take upon them the burden of the\nwork. They seek for an easier lot, a less self-denying position. This\nearth is not the resting place of Christians, much less for the chosen\nministers of God. They forget that Christ left His riches and glory\nin heaven, and came to earth to die, and that He has commanded us\nto love one another even as He has loved us. They forget those of\nwhom the world was not worthy, who wandered about in sheepskins\nand goatskins, and were afflicted and tormented.\nI was shown the Waldenses, and what they suffered for their\nreligion. They conscientiously studied the word of God, and lived\nup to the light which shone upon them. They were persecuted, and\ndriven from their homes; their possessions, gained by hard labor,\nwere taken from them, and their houses burned. They fled to the\nmountains and there suffered incredible hardships. They endured\nhunger, fatigue, cold, and nakedness. The only clothing which\nmany of them could obtain was the skins of animals. And yet the\nscattered and homeless ones would assemble to unite their voices\nin singing, and praising God that they were accounted worthy to\nsuffer for Christ\u2019s name. They encouraged and cheered one another,\nand were grateful for even their miserable retreat. Many of their\n356 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nchildren sickened and died from cold and hunger, yet the parents\ndid not for a moment think of yielding their religion. They prized\nthe love and favor of God far above earthly ease or worldly riches.\nThey received consolation from God and with pleasing anticipations[372]\nlooked forward to the recompense of reward.\nAgain, I was shown Martin Luther, whom God raised up to do\na special work. How precious to him was the knowledge of truth\nrevealed in the word of God! His mind was starving for something\nsure upon which to build his hope that God would be his Father, and\nheaven his home. The new and precious light which dawned upon\nhim from the word of God was of priceless value, and he thought\nthat if he went forth with it, he could convince the world. He stood\nup against the ire of a fallen church and strengthened those who with\nhim were feasting upon the rich truths contained in the word of God.\nLuther was God\u2019s chosen instrument to tear off the garb of hypocrisy\nfrom the papal church and expose her corruption. He raised his voice\nzealously and in the power of the Holy Spirit cried out against and\nrebuked the existing sins of the leaders of the people. Proclamations\nwent forth to kill him wherever he might be found; he seemed left to\nthe mercies of a superstitious people who were obedient to the head\nof the Roman Church. Yet he counted not his life dear unto himself.\nLuther knew that he was not safe anywhere, yet he trembled not.\nThe light which he saw and feasted upon was life to him, and was\nof more value than all the treasures of earth. Earthly treasures he\nknew would fail; but the rich truths opened to his understanding,\noperating upon his heart, would live, and, if obeyed, would lead him\nto immortality.\nWhen summoned to Augsburg to answer for his faith, he obeyed\nthe summons. That one lone man who had stirred the rage of priests\nand people was arraigned before those who had caused the world to\ntremble\u2014a meek lamb surrounded by angry lions; yet for the sake of\nChrist and the truth he stood up undaunted, and with holy eloquence,\nwhich the truth alone can inspire, he gave the reasons of his faith. His\nenemies tried by various means to silence the bold advocate for truth.[373]\nAt first they flattered him, and held out the promise that he should\nbe exalted and honored. But life and honors were valueless to him if\npurchased at the sacrifice of the truth. Brighter and clearer shone the\nword of God upon his understanding, giving him a more vivid sense\nDangers and Duty of Ministers 357\nof the errors, corruptions, and hypocrisy of the papacy. His enemies\nthen sought to intimidate him and cause him to renounce his faith,\nbut he boldly stood in defense of the truth. He was ready to die for\nhis faith, if God required; but to yield it\u2014never. God preserved his\nlife. He bade angels attend him and baffle the rage and purposes of\nhis enemies, and bring him unharmed through the stormy conflict.\nThe calm, dignified power of Luther humbled his enemies, and\ndealt a most dreadful blow to the papacy. The great and proud men\nin power meant that his blood should atone for the mischief he had\ndone their cause. Their plans were laid, but a mightier than they had\ncharge of Luther. His work was not finished. The friends of Luther\nhastened his departure from Augsburg. He left the city by night,\nmounted upon a horse without bridle, himself unarmed and without\nboots or spurs. In great weariness he pursued his journey until he\nwas among his friends.\nAgain the indignation of the papacy was aroused, and they re-\nsolved to stop the mouth of that fearless advocate of truth. They\nsummoned him to Worms, fully determined to make him answer for\nhis folly. He was in feeble health, yet he did not excuse himself.\nHe well knew the dangers that were before him. He knew that his\npowerful enemies would take any measures to silence him. They\nwere crying for his blood as eagerly as the Jews clamored for the\nblood of Christ. Yet he trusted in that God who preserved the three\nworthies in the burning fiery furnace. His anxiety and care were not\nfor himself. He sought not his own ease; but his great anxiety was\nthat the truth, to him so precious, should not be exposed to the insults\nof the ungodly. He was ready to die rather than allow its enemies [374]\nto triumph. As he entered Worms, thousands of persons pressed\naround and followed him. Emperors and others in high authority\nwere attended with no greater company. The excitement was intense;\nand one in that throng, with a shrill and plaintive voice, chanted a\nfuneral dirge to warn Luther of what awaited him. But the Reformer\nhad counted the cost and was ready to seal his testimony with his\nblood if God so ordained.\nLuther was about to appear to answer for his faith before a most\nimposing assembly, and he looked to God in faith for strength. For\na little time his courage and faith were tested. Perils in every form\nwere presented before him. He became sad. Clouds gathered around\n358 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhim and hid from him the face of God. He longed to go forth with a\nconfident assurance that God was with him. He could not be satisfied\nunless he was shut in with God. With broken cries he sent up his\nagonizing prayer to Heaven. His spirit at times seemed to faint, as\nhis enemies, in his imagination, multiplied before him. He trembled\nat his danger. I saw that God in His wise providence prepared him in\nthis way that he might not forget in whom to trust, and that he should\nnot rush on presumptuously into danger. As His own instrument,\nGod was fitting him for the great work before him.\nLuther\u2019s prayer was heard. His courage and faith returned as\nhe met his enemies. Meek as a lamb he stood, surrounded by the\ngreat men of the earth, who, like angry wolves, fastened their eyes\nupon him, hoping to awe him with their power and greatness. But\nhe had taken hold of the strength of God and feared not. His words\nwere spoken with such majesty and power that his enemies could do\nnothing against him. God was speaking through Luther, and He had\nbrought together emperors and professed wise men that He might\npublicly bring to nought their wisdom, and that they all might see\nthe strength and firmness of feeble man when leaning upon God, his\neternal Rock.\nThe calm bearing of Luther was in striking contrast to the passion[375]\nand rage exhibited by those so-called great men. They could not\nfrighten him into a recantation of the truth. In noble simplicity and\ncalm firmness he stood like a rock. The opposition of his enemies,\ntheir rage and threats, like a mighty wave, surged against him and\nbroke harmless at his feet. He remained unmoved. They were\nchagrined that their power, which had caused kings and nobles to\ntremble, should be thus despised by a humble man, and they longed\nto make him feel their wrath by torturing his life away. But One who\nis mightier than the potentates of earth had charge of this fearless\nwitness. God had a work for him to do. He must yet suffer for the\ntruth. He must see it wade through bloody persecutions. He must\nsee it clothed in sackcloth and covered with reproach by fanatics. He\nmust live to justify it and to be its defender when the mighty powers\nof earth should seek to tear it down. He must live to see it triumph\nand tear away the errors and superstitions of the papacy. Luther\ngained a victory at Worms which weakened the papacy, the news\nDangers and Duty of Ministers 359\nof which spread to other kingdoms and nations. It was an effectual\nblow in favor of the Reformation.\nMinisters who are preaching present truth were held up to me\nin contrast with the leading men of the Reformation; especially\nwas Luther\u2019s devoted, zealous life placed beside the lives of some\nof our preachers. He proved his undying love for the truth by his\ncourage, his calm firmness, his self-denial. He encountered trials\nand sacrifices, and at times suffered the deepest anguish of soul,\nwhile standing in defense of the truth; yet he murmured not. He was\nhunted like a wild beast of prey, yet for Christ\u2019s sake he endured all\ncheerfully.\nThe last merciful message is entrusted to God\u2019s humble, faithful\nservants of this time. God has led along those who would not shun\nresponsibility, and has laid burdens upon them, and has through them [376]\npresented to His people a plan of systematic benevolence in which\nall can engage and work in harmony. This system has been carried\nout and has worked like magic. It liberally sustains the preachers\nand the cause. As soon as the preachers ceased their opposition\nand stood out of the way, the people heartily responded to the call\nand prized the system. Everything is made convenient and easy for\nthe preachers that they may work, free from embarrassment. Our\npeople have taken hold with a will and an interest which is not to be\nfound among any other class. And God is displeased with preachers\nwho now complain and fail to throw their whole energies into this\nall-important work. They are without excuse; yet some are deceived\nand think that they are sacrificing much, and are having a hard time,\nwhen they really know nothing about suffering, self-denial, or want.\nThey may often be weary; so would they be if they were dependent\non manual labor for a support.\nSome have thought it would be easier to labor with their hands\nand have often expressed their choice to do so. Such do not know\nwhat they are talking about. They are deceiving themselves. Some\nhave very expensive families to provide for, and they lack manage-\nment. They do not realize that they are indebted to the cause of\nGod for their homes and all that they have. They have not realized\nhow much it costs to live. Should they engage in manual labor,\nthey would not be free from anxiety and weariness. They could not,\nwhile laboring to support their families, be sitting down at their own\n360 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfiresides. It is only a few weary hours that a laboring man with a\nfamily dependent upon him for support can spend with his family at\nhome. Some ministers do not love industrious labor, and they have\ncherished a feeling of dissatisfaction which is very unreasonable.\nGod has marked every murmuring thought and word and feeling.\nHeaven is insulted by such an exhibition of weakness and lack of[377]\ndevotion to the cause of God.\nSome have given a willing ear to the tempter and have talked out\ntheir unbelief and wounded the cause. Satan has claims upon them,\nfor they have not recovered themselves from his snare. They have\nconducted themselves like children who were wholly unacquainted\nwith the wiles of the tempter. They have had sufficient experience\nand should have understood his workings. He has suggested doubts\nto their minds, and, instead of repelling them at once, they have\nreasoned and parleyed with the archdeceiver, and listened to his\nreasonings, as though charmed by the old serpent. A few texts which\nwere not perfectly explainable to the satisfaction of their own minds\nhave been sufficient to shake the whole structure of truth and to\nobscure the plainest facts of the word of God. These men are erring\nmortals. They have not perfect wisdom and knowledge in all the\nScriptures. Some passages are placed beyond the reach of human\nminds until such a time as God chooses, in His own wisdom, to\nopen them. Satan has been leading some on a trail which ends in\ncertain infidelity. They have suffered their unbelief to becloud the\nharmonious, glorious chain of truth, and have acted as though it was\ntheir business to solve every difficult passage of Scripture, and if our\nfaith did not enable them to do this, it was faulty.\nI saw that those who have an evil heart of unbelief will doubt and\nwill think it noble and a virtue to doubt the word of God. Those who\nthink it a virtue to quibble can have plenty of room to disbelieve the\ninspiration and truth of God\u2019s word. God does not compel any to\nbelieve. They can choose to rely upon the evidences He has been\npleased to give, or doubt, and cavil, and perish.\nI was shown that those who are troubled with doubts and infi-\ndelity should not go out to labor for others. That which is in the[378]\nmind must flow out, and they realize not the effect of a hint or the\nsmallest doubt expressed. Satan makes it a barbed arrow. It acts\nlike a slow poison, which, before the victim is made sensible of his\nDangers and Duty of Ministers 361\ndanger, affects the whole system, undermines a good constitution,\nand finally causes death. It is just so with the poison of doubt and\nunbelief of Scripture facts. One who has influence suggests to others\nthat which Satan has suggested to him, that one scripture contradicts\nanother; and thus, in a very wise manner, as though he had found\nout some wonderful mystery which had been hid from believers and\nthe holy in every age of the world, he casts midnight darkness into\nother minds. They lose the relish they once had for the truth and\nbecome infidels. All this is the work of a few words spoken, which\nhad a hidden power because they seemed involved in mystery.\nThis is the work of a cunning devil. Those who are troubled\nwith doubts, and have difficulties which they cannot solve, should\nnot throw other weak minds into the same perplexity. Some have\nhinted or talked their unbelief and have passed on, little dreaming\nof the effect produced. In some instances the seeds of unbelief have\ntaken immediate effect, while in others they have lain buried quite\na length of time, until the individual has taken a wrong course and\ngiven place to the enemy, and the light of God has been withdrawn\nfrom him, and he has fallen under the powerful temptations of Satan.\nThen the seeds of infidelity which were sown so long ago spring up.\nSatan nourishes them, and they bear fruit. Anything coming from\nministers who should stand in the light has a powerful influence.\nAnd when they have not stood in the clear light of God, Satan has\nused them as agents and has through them transmitted his fiery darts\nto minds not prepared to resist what has come from their ministers.\nI saw that ministers, as well as people, have a warfare before\nthem to resist Satan. The professed minister of Christ is in a fearful [379]\nposition when serving the purposes of the tempter, by listening\nto his whisperings, and letting him captivate the mind and guide\nthe thoughts. The minister\u2019s most grievous sin in the sight of God\nis talking out his unbelief and drawing other minds into the same\ndark channel, thus suffering Satan to carry out a twofold purpose in\ntempting him. He unsettles the mind of the one whose course has\nencouraged his temptations and then leads that one to unsettle the\nminds of many.\nIt is time that the watchmen upon the walls of Zion understood\nthe responsibility and sacredness of their mission. They should feel\nthat a woe is upon them if they do not perform the work which\n362 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nGod has committed to them. If they become unfaithful, they are\nendangering the safety of the flock of God, endangering the cause\nof truth, and exposing it to the ridicule of our enemies. Oh, what a\nwork is this! It will surely meet its reward. Some ministers, as well\nas people, need converting. They need to be torn to pieces and made\nover new. Their work among the churches is worse than lost, and in\ntheir present weak, tottering condition, it would be more pleasing\nto God for them to cease their efforts to help others, and labor with\ntheir hands until they are converted. Then they could strengthen\ntheir brethren.\nMinisters must arouse. They profess to be generals in the army\nof the great King, and at the same time are sympathizers with the\ngreat rebel leader and his host. Some have exposed the cause of God,\nand the sacred truths of His word, to the reproaches of the rebel host.\nThey have removed a portion of their armor, and Satan has hurled\nin his poisoned arrows. They have strengthened the hands of the\nrebel leaders, and weakened themselves, and caused Satan and his\nhellish clan to rear their heads in triumph, and exult on account of\nthe victory they have let him gain. Oh, what a lack of wisdom! What\nblindness! What foolish generalship, to open their weakest points to\ntheir deadliest foes! How unlike the course pursued by Luther! He[380]\nwas willing to sacrifice his life, if need be, but the truth, never. His\nwords are: \u201cLet us only take care that the gospel be not exposed to\nthe insults of the ungodly, and let us shed our blood in its defense,\nrather than allow them to triumph. Who will say whether my life or\nmy death would contribute most to the salvation of my brethren?\u201d\nGod is not dependent upon any man for the advancement of His\ncause. He is raising up and qualifying men to bear the message to\nthe world. He can make His strength perfect in the weakness of\nmen. The power is of God. Ready speech, eloquence, great talents,\nwill not convert a single soul. The efforts in the pulpit may stir up\nminds, the plain arguments may be convincing, but God giveth the\nincrease. Godly men, faithful, holy men, who carry out in their\neveryday life that which they preach, will exert a saving influence.\nA powerful discourse delivered from the desk may affect minds; but\na little imprudence upon the part of the minister out of the pulpit,\na lack of gravity of speech and true godliness, will counteract his\ninfluence, and do away the good impressions made by him. The\nDangers and Duty of Ministers 363\nconverts will be his; in many instances they will seek to rise no\nhigher than their preacher. There will be in them no thorough heart\nwork. They are not converted to God. The work is superficial, and\ntheir influence will be an injury to those who are really seeking the\nLord.\nThe success of a minister depends much upon his deportment\nout of the desk. When he ceases preaching and leaves the desk, his\nwork is not finished; it is only commenced. He must then carry out\nwhat he has preached. He should not move heedlessly, but set a\nwatch over himself, lest something that he may do and say be taken\nadvantage of by the enemy, and a reproach be brought upon the\ncause of Christ. Ministers cannot be too guarded, especially before\nthe young. They should use no lightness of speech, jesting or joking,\nbut should remember that they are in Christ\u2019s stead, that they must [381]\nillustrate by example the life of Christ. \u201cFor we are laborers together\nwith God.\u201d \u201cWe then, as workers together with Him, beseech you\nalso that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\u201d\nI was shown that the usefulness of young ministers, married or\nunmarried, is often destroyed by the attachment shown to them by\nyoung women. Such do not realize that other eyes are upon them,\nand that the course pursued by them may have a tendency to very\nmuch injure the influence of the minister to whom they give so much\nattention. If they would strictly regard the rules of propriety, it would\nbe much better for them and much better for their minister. It places\nhim in a disagreeable position and causes others to look upon him in\na wrong light. Yet I saw that the burden of the matter rests upon the\nministers themselves. They should show a distaste for these things,\nand if they take the course which God would have them, they will\nnot be troubled long. They should shun every appearance of evil,\nand when young women are very sociable, it is their duty to let them\nknow that it is not pleasing. They must repulse this forwardness\neven if they are thought to be rude. Such things should be rebuked\nin order to save the cause from reproach. Young women who have\nbeen converted to the truth and to God will listen to reproof and will\nbe reformed.\nMinisters should follow up their public labors by private efforts,\nlaboring personally for souls whenever there is an opportunity, con-\nversing around the fireside, and entreating souls to seek for those\n364 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthings which make for their peace. Our work here is soon to close,\nand every man will receive his reward according to his own labor. I\nwas shown the saints\u2019 reward, the immortal inheritance, and saw that\nthose who had endured the most for the truth\u2019s sake will not think\nthey have had a hard time, but will count heaven cheap enough.\nChapter 71\u2014Wrong Use of the Visions [382]\nI have been shown that some, especially in Iowa, make the\nvisions a rule by which to measure all, and have taken a course which\nmy husband and myself have never pursued. Some are unacquainted\nwith me and my labors, and they are very skeptical of anything\nbearing the name of visions. This is all natural, and can be overcome\nonly by experience. If persons are not settled in regard to the visions,\nthey should not be crowded off. The course to pursue with such\nmay be found in Testimony No. 8, pp. 328, 329, which I hope\nwill be read by all. Ministers should have compassion of some,\nmaking a difference; others save with fear, pulling them out of the\nfire. God\u2019s ministers should have wisdom to give to everyone his\nportion of meat and to make that difference with different persons\nwhich their cases require. The course pursued with some in Iowa\nwho are unacquainted with me has not been careful and consistent.\nThose who were, comparatively, strangers to the visions have been\ndealt with in the same manner as those who have had much light\nand experience in the visions. Some have been required to endorse\nthe visions when they could not conscientiously do so, and in this\nway some honest souls have been driven to take positions against\nthe visions and against the body which they never would have taken\nhad their cases been managed with discretion and mercy.\nSome of our brethren have had long experience in the truth and\nhave for years been acquainted with me and with the influence of the\nvisions. They have tested the truthfulness of these testimonies and\nasserted their belief in them. They have felt the powerful influence\nof the Spirit of God resting upon them to witness to the truthfulness\nof the visions. If such, when reproved through vision, rise up against\nthem, and work secretly to injure our influence, they should be\nfaithfully dealt with, for their influence is endangering those who [383]\nlack experience.\nMinisters of present truth, while they bear a pointed testimony,\nreproving individual wrongs and seeking to tear away the idols from\n365\n366 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe camp of Israel, should manifest forbearance. They should preach\nthe truth in its solemnity and importance, and if this finds its way\nto the heart it will accomplish that for the receiver which nothing\nelse can. But if the truth spoken in the demonstration of the Spirit\ndoes not cut away the idols, it will be of no avail to denounce and\nbear down upon the individual. It may appear that some are joined\nto their idols, yet I saw that we should be very reluctant to give\nup the poor, deceived ones. We should ever bear in mind that we\nare all erring mortals, and that Christ exercises much pity for our\nweakness, and loves us although we err. If God should deal with us\nas we often deal with one another, we should be consumed. While\nministers preach the plain, cutting truth, they must let the truth do the\ncutting and hewing, not do it themselves. They should lay the ax, the\ntruths of God\u2019s word, at the root of the tree, and something will be\naccomplished. Pour out the testimony just as straight as it is found\nin the word of God, with a heart full of the warming, quickening\ninfluence of His Spirit, all in tenderness, yearning for souls, and the\nwork among God\u2019s people will be effectual. The reason why there\nis so little of the Spirit of God manifested is that ministers learn to\ndo without it. They lack the grace of God, lack forbearance and\npatience, lack a spirit of consecration and sacrifice; and this is the\nonly reason why some are doubting the evidences of God\u2019s word.\nThe trouble is not at all in the word of God, but in themselves. They\nlack the grace of God, lack devotion, personal piety, and holiness.\nThis leads them to be unstable, and throws them often on Satan\u2019s\nbattlefield. I saw that however strongly men may have advocated\nthe truth, however pious they may appear to be, when they begin to[384]\ntalk unbelief in regard to some scriptures, claiming that they cause\nthem to doubt the inspiration of the Bible, we should be afraid of\nthem, for God is at a great distance from them.\n* * * * *\nChapter 72\u2014Parents and Children\nI have been shown that while parents who have the fear of God\nbefore them restrain their children, they should study their disposi-\ntions and temperaments, and seek to meet their wants. Some parents\nattend carefully to the temporal wants of their children; they kindly\nand faithfully nurse them in sickness, and then think their duty done.\nHere they mistake. Their work has but just begun. The wants of\nthe mind should be cared for. It requires skill to apply the proper\nremedies to cure a wounded mind. Children have trials just as hard\nto bear, just as grievous in character, as those of older persons. Par-\nents themselves do not feel the same at all times. Their minds are\noften perplexed. They labor under mistaken views and feelings.\nSatan buffets them, and they yield to his temptations. They speak\nirritably, and in a manner to excite wrath in their children, and are\nsometimes exacting and fretful. The poor children partake of the\nsame spirit, and the parents are not prepared to help them, for they\nwere the cause of the trouble. Sometimes everything seems to go\nwrong. There is fretfulness all around, and all have a very miserable,\nunhappy time. The parents lay the blame upon their poor children\nand think them very disobedient and unruly, the worst children in\nthe world, when the cause of the disturbance is in themselves.\nSome parents raise many a storm by their lack of self-control.\nInstead of kindly asking the children to do this or that, they order\nthem in a scolding tone, and at the same time a censure or reproof [385]\nis on their lips which the children have not merited. Parents, this\ncourse pursued toward your children destroys their cheerfulness and\nambition. They do your bidding, not from love, but because they dare\nnot do otherwise. Their heart is not in the matter. It is a drudgery,\ninstead of a pleasure, and this often leads them to forget to follow\nout all your directions, which increases your irritation, and makes it\nstill worse for the children. The faultfinding is repeated, their bad\nconduct arrayed before them in glowing colors, until discouragement\ncomes over them, and they are not particular whether they please\n367\n368 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nor not. A spirit of \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d seizes them, and they seek that\npleasure and enjoyment away from home, away from their parents,\nwhich they do not find at home. They mingle with street company\nand are soon as corrupt as the worst.\nUpon whom rests this great sin? If home had been made attrac-\ntive, if the parents had manifested affection for their children, and\nwith kindness found employment for them, and in love instructed\nthem how to obey their wishes, they would have touched an an-\nswering chord in their hearts, and willing feet and hands and hearts\nwould all have readily obeyed them. By controlling themselves, and\nspeaking kindly, and praising the children when they try to do right,\nparents may encourage their efforts, make them very happy, and\nthrow over the family circle a charm which will chase away every\ndark shadow and bring cheerful sunlight in.\nParents sometimes excuse their own wrong course because they\ndo not feel well. They are nervous, and think they cannot be patient\nand calm, and speak pleasantly. In this they deceive themselves and\nplease Satan, who exults that the grace of God is not regarded by\nthem as sufficient to overcome natural infirmities. They can and\nshould at all times control themselves. God requires it of them. They\nshould realize that when they yield to impatience and fretfulness\nthey cause others to suffer. Those around them are affected by the[386]\nspirit they manifest, and if they in their turn act out the same spirit,\nthe evil is increased and everything goes wrong.\nParents, when you feel fretful, you should not commit so great a\nsin as to poison the whole family with this dangerous irritability. At\nsuch times set a double watch over yourselves, and resolve in your\nheart not to offend with your lips, that you will utter only pleasant,\ncheerful words. Say to yourselves: \u201cI will not mar the happiness of\nmy children by a fretful word.\u201d By thus controlling yourselves, you\nwill grow stronger. Your nervous system will not be so sensitive. You\nwill be strengthened by the principles of right. The consciousness\nthat you are faithfully discharging your duty will strengthen you.\nAngels of God will smile upon your efforts and help you. When you\nfeel impatient, you too often think the cause is in your children, and\nyou blame them when they do not deserve it. At another time they\nmight do the very same things and all would be acceptable and right.\nChildren know, and mark, and feel these irregularities, and they are\nParents and Children 369\nnot always the same. At times they are somewhat prepared to meet\nchangeable moods, and at other times they are nervous and fretful,\nand cannot bear censure. Their spirit rises up in rebellion against it.\nParents want all due allowance made for their state of mind, yet do\nnot always see the necessity of making the same allowance for their\npoor children. They excuse in themselves that which, if seen in their\nchildren who have not their years of experience and discipline, they\nwould highly censure. Some parents are of a nervous temperament,\nand when fatigued with labor or oppressed with care, they do not\npreserve a calm state of mind, but manifest to those who should be\ndearest to them on earth, a fretfulness and lack of forbearance which\ndispleases God and brings a cloud over the family. Children, in their\ntroubles, should often be soothed with tender sympathy. Mutual\nkindness and forbearance will make home a paradise and attract [387]\nholy angels into the family circle.\nThe mother can and should do much toward controlling her\nnerves and mind when depressed; even when she is sick, she can,\nif she only schools herself, be pleasant and cheerful, and can bear\nmore noise than she would once have thought possible. She should\nnot make the children feel her infirmities and cloud their young,\nsensitive minds by her depression of spirits, causing them to feel that\nthe house is a tomb and the mother\u2019s room the most dismal place\nin the world. The mind and nerves gain tone and strength by the\nexercise of the will. The power of the will in many cases will prove\na potent soother of the nerves.\nDo not let your children see you with a clouded brow. If they\nyield to temptation, and afterward see and repent of their error,\nforgive them just as freely as you hope to be forgiven by your Father\nin heaven. Kindly instruct them, and bind them to your hearts. It\nis a critical time for children. Influences will be thrown around\nthem to wean them from you, which you must counteract. Teach\nthem to make you their confidant. Let them whisper in your ear\ntheir trials and joys. By encouraging this, you will save them from\nmany a snare that Satan has prepared for their inexperienced feet.\nDo not treat your children only with sternness, forgetting your own\nchildhood, and forgetting that they are but children. Do not expect\nthem to be perfect or try to make them men and women in their acts\nat once. By so doing, you will close the door of access which you\n370 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmight otherwise have to them, and will drive them to open a door for\ninjurious influences, for others to poison their young minds before\nyou awake to their danger.\nSatan and his host are making most powerful efforts to sway the\nminds of the children, and they must be treated with candor, Christian\ntenderness, and love. This will give you a strong influence over\nthem, and they will feel that they can repose unlimited confidence[388]\nin you. Throw around your children the charms of home and of\nyour society. If you do this, they will not have so much desire for\nthe society of young associates. Satan works through these, leading\nthem to influence and corrupt the minds of one another. It is the most\neffectual way in which he can work. The young have a powerful\ninfluence over one another. Their conversation is not always choice\nand elevated. Evil communications are breathed into the ear, which,\nif not decidedly resisted, find a lodgment in the heart, take root, and\nspring up to bear fruit and corrupt good manners. Because of the\nevils now in the world, and the restriction necessary to be placed\nupon the children, parents should have double care to bind them to\ntheir hearts and let them see that they wish to make them happy.\nParents should not forget their childhood years, how much they\nyearned for sympathy and love, and how unhappy they felt when\ncensured and fretfully chided. They should be young again in their\nfeelings and bring their minds down to understand the wants of\ntheir children. Yet with firmness, mixed with love, they should\nrequire obedience from their children. The parents\u2019 word should be\nimplicitly obeyed.\nAngels of God are watching the children with the deepest interest\nto see what characters they develop. If Christ dealt with us as we\noften deal with one another and with our children, we would stumble\nand fall through utter discouragement. I saw that Jesus knows our\ninfirmities, and has Himself shared our experience in all things but in\nsin; therefore He has prepared for us a path suited to our strength and\ncapacity, and, like Jacob, has marched softly and in evenness with\nthe children as they were able to endure, that He might entertain us\nby the comfort of His company, and be to us a perpetual guide. He\ndoes not despise, neglect, or leave behind the children of the flock.\nHe has not bidden us move forward and leave them. He has not\ntraveled so hastily as to leave us with our children behind. Oh, no;[389]\nParents and Children 371\nbut He has evened the path to life, even for children. And parents are\nrequired in His name to lead them along the narrow way. God has\nappointed us a path suited to the strength and capacity of children.\n* * * * *\nChapter 73\u2014Labor in the East\nI have been shown that the time has come for more effective\nlabor in the East. The necessity of organization and order is at last\nfelt there. Ministers will not now be obliged to labor under such\ndiscouragements as before. The angel of mercy is hovering over the\nEast. Said the angel: \u201cStrengthen the things that remain. Proclaim\nthe message to those who have not heard it.\u201d There are some in the\nEast who will be in danger of going to extremes when the Lord shall\nrevive His work among them. They should remember that the Lord\nremoved His work from them to the West to humble them, and to\nsubdue an independent, rebellious spirit in them, and lead them to\nbetter prize the efforts of His faithful servants.\n372\nNumber Ten\u2014Testimony for the Church [390]\nChapter 74\u2014Dangers of the Young\nJune 6, 1863, I was shown some of the dangers of the young.\nSatan is controlling the minds of the youth and leading their inex-\nperienced feet astray. They are ignorant of his devices, and in these\nperilous times parents should be awake and work with perseverance\nand industry to shut out the first approach of the foe. They should\ninstruct their children when they go out and when they come in,\nwhen they rise up, and when they sit down, giving line upon line,\nprecept upon precept, here a little and there a little.\nThe mother\u2019s work commences with the infant. She should\nsubdue the will and temper of her child, and bring it into subjection,\nteach it to obey. As the child grows older, relax not the hand. Every\nmother should take time to reason with her children, to correct their\nerrors, and patiently teach them the right way. Christian parents\nshould know that they are instructing and fitting their children to\nbecome children of God. The entire religious experience of the\nchildren is influenced by the instructions given, and the character\nformed, in childhood. If the will is not then subdued and made to\nyield to the will of the parents, it will be a difficult task to learn\nthe lesson in after years. What a severe struggle, what a conflict,\nto yield that will which never was subdued, to the requirements of\nGod! Parents who neglect this important work commit a great error,[391]\nand sin against their poor children and against God.\nChildren who are under strict discipline will at times have dis-\nsatisfied feelings. They will become impatient under restraint, and\nwill wish to have their own way, and go and come as they please.\nEspecially from the age of ten to eighteen, they will often feel that\nthere would be no harm in going to picnics and other gatherings\nof young associates; yet their experienced parents can see danger.\nThey are acquainted with the peculiar temperaments of their chil-\ndren and know the influence of these things upon their minds, and\nfrom a desire for their salvation keep them back from these exciting\namusements. When these children decide for themselves to leave the\n374\nDangers of the Young 375\npleasures of the world and become Christ\u2019s disciples, what a burden\nis lifted from the hearts of careful, faithful parents! Yet even then the\nlabor of the parents must not cease. The children should not be left\nto take their own course and always choose for themselves. They\nhave but just commenced in earnest the warfare against sin, pride,\npassion, envy, jealousy, hatred, and all the evils of the natural heart.\nAnd parents need to watch and counsel their children, and decide\nfor them, and show them that if they do not yield cheerful, willing\nobedience to their parents, they cannot yield willing obedience to\nGod, and it is impossible for them to be Christians.\nParents should encourage their children to confide in them, and\nunburden to them their heart griefs, their little daily annoyances and\ntrials. Thus the parents can learn to sympathize with their children,\nand can pray with and for them that God would shield and guide\nthem. They should point them to their never-failing Friend and\nCounselor, who will be touched with the feeling of their infirmities,\nwho was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.\nSatan tempts children to be reserved with their parents and\nto choose as their confidants their young and inexperienced\ncompanions, such as cannot help them, but will give them bad ad- [392]\nvice. Girls and boys get together and chat, and laugh, and joke, and\ndrive Christ out of their hearts, and angels from their presence, by\ntheir foolish nonsense. Unprofitable conversation upon the acts of\nothers, small talk about this young man or that girl, withers noble,\ndevotional thoughts and feelings, and drives good and holy desires\nfrom the heart, leaving it cold and destitute of true love for God and\nHis truth.\nChildren would be saved from many evils if they would be more\nfamiliar with their parents. Parents should encourage in their children\na disposition to be open and frank with them, to come to them with\ntheir difficulties, and when they are perplexed as to what course is\nright, to lay the matter just as they view it before the parents and\nask their advice. Who are so well calculated to see and point out\ntheir dangers as godly parents? Who can understand the peculiar\ntemperaments of their own children as well as they? The mother\nwho has watched every turn of the mind from infancy, and is thus\nacquainted with the natural disposition, is best prepared to counsel\n376 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nher children. Who can tell as well what traits of character to check\nand restrain, as the mother, aided by the father?\nChildren who are Christians will prefer the love and approbation\nof their God-fearing parents above every earthly blessing. They will\nlove and honor their parents. It should be one of the principal studies\nof their lives, how to make their parents happy. In this rebellious age,\nchildren who have not received right instruction and discipline have\nbut little sense of their obligations to their parents. It is often the case\nthat the more their parents do for them, the more ungrateful they\nare, and the less they respect them. Children who have been petted\nand waited upon, always expect it; and if their expectations are not\nmet, they are disappointed and discouraged. This same disposition\nwill be seen through their whole lives; they will be helpless, leaning\nupon others for aid, expecting others to favor them and yield to them.[393]\nAnd if they are opposed, even after they have grown to manhood\nand womanhood, they think themselves abused; and thus they worry\ntheir way through the world, hardly able to bear their own weight,\noften murmuring and fretting because everything does not suit them.\nMistaken parents are teaching their children lessons which will\nprove ruinous to them, and are also planting thorns for their own\nfeet. They think that by gratifying the wishes of their children, and\nletting them follow their own inclinations, they can gain their love.\nWhat an error! Children thus indulged grow up unrestrained in\ntheir desires, unyielding in their dispositions, selfish, exacting, and\noverbearing, a curse to themselves and to all around them. To a\ngreat extent, parents hold in their own hands the future happiness of\ntheir children. Upon them rests the important work of forming the\ncharacter of these children. The instructions given in childhood will\nfollow them all through life. Parents sow the seed which will spring\nup and bear fruit either for good or evil. They can fit their sons and\ndaughters for happiness or for misery.\nChildren should be taught very young to be useful, to help them-\nselves, and to help others. Many daughters of this age can, without\nremorse of conscience, see their mothers toiling, cooking, washing,\nor ironing, while they sit in the parlor and read stories, knit edging,\ncrochet, or embroider. Their hearts are as unfeeling as a stone. But\nwhere does this wrong originate? Who are the ones usually most to\nblame in this matter? The poor, deceived parents. They overlook\nDangers of the Young 377\nthe future good of their children, and in their mistaken fondness, let\nthem sit in idleness, or do that which is of but little account, which\nrequires no exercise of the mind or muscles, and then excuse their\nindolent daughters because they are weakly. What has made them\nweakly? In many cases it has been the wrong course of the parents. [394]\nA proper amount of exercise about the house would improve both\nmind and body. But children are deprived of this through false ideas,\nuntil they are averse to work. It is disagreeable and does not accord\nwith their ideas of gentility. It is thought to be unladylike and even\ncoarse to wash dishes, iron, or stand over the washtub. This is the\nfashionable instruction which is given children in this unfortunate\nage.\nGod\u2019s people should be governed by higher principles than\nworldlings, who seek to gauge all their course of action accord-\ning to fashion. God-fearing parents should train their children for a\nlife of usefulness. They should not permit their principles of gov-\nernment to be tainted with the extravagant notions prevailing in this\nage, that they must conform to the fashions and be governed by\nthe opinions of worldlings. They should not permit their children\nto choose their own associates. Teach them that it is your duty to\nchoose for them. Prepare them to bear burdens while young. If your\nchildren have been unaccustomed to labor, they will soon become\nweary. They will complain of side ache, pain in the shoulders, and\ntired limbs; and you will be in danger, through sympathy, of doing\nthe work yourselves, rather than have them suffer a little. Let the\nburden upon the children be very light at first, and then increase it a\nlittle every day, until they can do a proper amount of labor without\nbecoming so weary. Inactivity is the greatest cause of side ache and\nshoulder ache among children.\nThere is a class of young ladies in this age who are merely useless\ncreatures, only good to breathe, eat, wear, chat, and talk nonsense,\nwhile they hold in their fingers a bit of embroidery or crochet. But\nfew of the youth show real sound judgment and good common sense.\nThey lead a butterfly life with no special object in view. When this\nclass of worldly associates get together, about all you can hear is a\nfew silly remarks about dress, or some frivolous matter, and then [395]\nthey laugh at their own remarks which they consider very bright.\nThis is frequently done in the presence of older persons, who can\n378 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbut feel saddened at such lack of reverence for their years. These\nyouth seem to have lost all sense of modesty and good manners. Yet\nthe manner in which they have been instructed leads them to think it\nthe height of gentility.\nThis spirit is like a contagious disease. God\u2019s people should\nchoose the society for their children and teach them to avoid the\ncompany of these vain worldlings. Mothers should take their daugh-\nters with them into the kitchen and patiently educate them. Their\nconstitution will be better for such labor, their muscles will gain\ntone and strength, and their meditations will be more healthy and\nelevated at the close of the day. They may be weary, but how sweet\nis rest after a proper amount of labor. Sleep, nature\u2019s sweet restorer,\ninvigorates the weary body, and prepares it for the next day\u2019s duties.\nDo not intimate to your children that it is no matter whether they\nlabor or not. Teach them that their help is needed, that their time is\nof value, and that you depend on their labor.\nI have been shown that much sin has resulted from idleness.\nActive hands and minds do not find time to heed every temptation\nwhich the enemy suggests, but idle hands and brains are all ready\nfor Satan to control. The mind, when not properly occupied, dwells\nupon improper things. Parents should teach their children that idle-\nness is sin. I was referred to Ezekiel 16:49: \u201cBehold, this was the\niniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance\nof idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen\nthe hand of the poor and needy.\u201d\nChildren should feel that they are indebted to their parents, who\nhave watched over them in infancy and nursed them in sickness.\nThey should realize that their parents have suffered much anxiety\non their account. Especially have conscientious, godly parents felt\nthe deepest interest that their children should take a right course. As\nthey have seen faults in their children, how heavy have been their\nhearts. If the children who caused those hearts to ache could see\nthe effect of their course, they would certainly relent. If they could\nsee their mother\u2019s tears and hear her prayers to God in their behalf,\nif they could listen to her suppressed and broken sighs, their hearts\nwould feel, and they would speedily confess their wrongs and ask to\nbe forgiven. There is a work to be accomplished for old and young.\nParents should better qualify themselves to discharge their duty to\nDangers of the Young 379\ntheir children. Some parents do not understand their children and\nare not really acquainted with them. There is often a great distance\nbetween parents and children. If the parents would enter more fully\ninto the feelings of their children and draw out what is in their hearts,\nit would have a beneficial influence upon them.\nParents should deal faithfully with the souls committed to their [396]\ntrust. They should not encourage in their children pride, extrava-\ngance, or love of show. They should not teach them, or suffer them\nto learn, little pranks which appear cunning in small children, but\nwhich they will have to unlearn, and for which they must be cor-\nrected, when they are older. The habits first formed are not easily\nforgotten. Parents, you should commence to discipline the minds of\nyour children while very young, to the end that they may be Chris-\ntians. Let all your efforts be for their salvation. Act as though they\nwere placed in your care to be fitted as precious jewels to shine in\nthe kingdom of God. Beware how you lull them to sleep over the\npit of destruction with the mistaken thought that they are not old\nenough to be accountable, not old enough to repent of their sins and\nprofess Christ.\nI was referred to the many precious promises on record for those\nwho seek their Saviour early. Ecclesiastes 12:1: \u201cRemember now\nthy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, [397]\nnor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in\nthem.\u201d Proverbs 8:17: \u201cI love them that love Me; and those that seek\nMe early shall find Me.\u201d The Great Shepherd of Israel is still saying:\n\u201cSuffer little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not: for of\nsuch is the kingdom of God.\u201d Teach your children that youth is the\nbest time to seek the Lord. Then the burdens of life are not heavy\nupon them, and their young minds are not harassed with care, and\nwhile so free they should devote the best of their strength to God.\nWe are living in an unfortunate age for children. A heavy current\nis setting downward to perdition, and more than childhood\u2019s experi-\nence and strength is needed to press against this current and not be\nborne down by it. The youth generally seem to be Satan\u2019s captives,\nand he and his angels are leading them to certain destruction. Satan\nand his hosts are warring against the government of God, and all who\nhave a desire to yield their hearts to him and obey his requirements,\n380 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nSatan will try to perplex and overcome with his temptations, that\nthey may become discouraged and give up the warfare.\nParents, help your children. Arouse from the lethargy which has\nbeen upon you. Watch continually to cut off the current and roll back\nthe weight of evil which Satan is pressing in upon your children.\nThe children cannot do this of themselves, but parents can do much.\nBy earnest prayer and living faith great victories will be gained.\nSome parents have not realized the responsibilities resting upon\nthem and have neglected the religious education of their children.\nIn the morning the Christian\u2019s first thoughts should be upon God.\nWorldly labor and self-interest should be secondary. Children should\nbe taught to respect and reverence the hour of prayer. Before leaving\nthe house for labor, all the family should be called together, and the\nfather, or the mother in the father\u2019s absence, should plead fervently\nwith God to keep them through the day. Come in humility with\na heart full of tenderness and with a sense of the temptations and[398]\ndangers before yourselves and your children; by faith bind them\nupon the altar, entreating for them the care of the Lord. Ministering\nangels will guard children who are thus dedicated to God. It is the\nduty of Christian parents, morning and evening, by earnest prayer\nand persevering faith, to make a hedge about their children. They\nshould patiently instruct them, kindly and untiringly teach them how\nto live in order to please God.\nImpatience in the parents excites impatience in the children.\nPassion manifested by the parents creates passion in the children\nand stirs up the evils of their nature. Some parents correct their\nchildren severely in a spirit of impatience, and often in passion.\nSuch corrections produce no good result. In seeking to correct one\nevil, they create two. Continual censuring and whipping hardens\nchildren and weans them from their parents. Parents should first\nlearn to control themselves, then they can more successfully control\ntheir children. Every time they lose self-control, and speak and act\nimpatiently, they sin against God. They should first reason with\ntheir children, clearly point out their wrongs, show them their sin,\nand impress upon them that they have not only sinned against their\nparents, but against God. With your own heart subdued and full\nof pity and sorrow for your erring children, pray with them before\ncorrecting them. Then your correction will not cause your children\nDangers of the Young 381\nto hate you. They will love you. They will see that you do not punish\nthem because they have put you to inconvenience, or because you\nwish to vent your displeasure upon them; but from a sense of duty,\nfor their good, that they may not be left to grow up in sin.\nSome parents have failed to give their children a religious ed-\nucation and have also neglected their school education. Neither\nshould have been neglected. Children\u2019s minds will be active, and\nif not engaged in physical labor, or occupied with study, they will\nbe exposed to evil influences. It is a sin for parents to allow their [399]\nchildren to grow up in ignorance. They should supply them with\nuseful and interesting books, and should teach them to work, to have\nhours for physical labor, and hours to devote to study and reading.\nParents should seek to elevate the minds of their children and to im-\nprove their mental faculties. The mind left to itself, uncultivated, is\ngenerally low, sensual, and corrupt. Satan improves his opportunity\nand educates idle minds.\nParents, the recording angel writes every impatient, fretful word\nyou utter to your children. Every failure on your part to give them\nproper instruction, and show them the exceeding sinfulness of sin,\nand the final result of a sinful course, is marked against your name.\nEvery unguarded word spoken before them, carelessly or in jest,\nevery word that is not chaste and elevated, the recording angel marks\nas a spot against your Christian character. All your acts are recorded,\nwhether they are good or bad.\nParents cannot succeed well in the government of their children\nuntil they first have perfect control of themselves. They must first\nlearn to subdue themselves, to control their words, and the very\nexpression of the countenance. They should not suffer the tones of\ntheir voice to be disturbed or agitated with excitement and passion.\nThen they can have a decided influence over their children. Children\nmay wish to do right, they may purpose in their hearts to be obedi-\nent and kind to their parents or guardians; but they need help and\nencouragement from them. They may make good resolutions; but\nunless their principles are strengthened by religion and their lives\ninfluenced by the renewing grace of God, they will fail to come up\nto the mark.\nParents should redouble their efforts for the salvation of their\nchildren. They should faithfully instruct them, not leaving them to\n382 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngather up their education as best they can. The young should not be\nsuffered to learn good and evil indiscriminately, with the idea that[400]\nat some future time the good will predominate and the evil lose its\ninfluence. The evil will increase faster than the good. It is possible\nthat the evil they have learned may be eradicated after many years;\nbut who will venture this? Time is short. It is easier and much safer\nto sow clean and good seed in the hearts of your children than to\npluck up the weeds afterward. It is the duty of parents to watch lest\nsurrounding influences have an injurious effect upon their children.\nIt is their duty to select the society for them and not suffer them to\nchoose for themselves. Who will attend to this work if the parents\ndo not? Can others have that interest for your children which you\nshould have? Can they have that constant care and deep love that\nparents have?\nSabbathkeeping children may become impatient of restraint,\nand think their parents too strict; hard feelings may even arise in\ntheir hearts, and discontented, unhappy thoughts may be cherished\nby them against those who are working for their present and their\nfuture and eternal good. But if life shall be spared a few years, they\nwill bless their parents for that strict care and faithful watchfulness\nover them in their years of inexperience. Parents should explain\nand simplify the plan of salvation to their children that their young\nminds may comprehend it. Children of eight, ten, or twelve years\nare old enough to be addressed on the subject of personal religion.\nDo not teach your children with reference to some future period\nwhen they shall be old enough to repent and believe the truth. If\nproperly instructed, very young children may have correct views\nof their state as sinners and of the way of salvation through Christ.\nMinisters are generally too indifferent to the salvation of children\nand are not as personal as they should be. Golden opportunities to\nimpress the minds of children frequently pass unimproved.\nThe evil influence around our children is almost overpowering;\nit is corrupting their minds and leading them down to perdition. The[401]\nminds of youth are naturally given to folly; and at an early age,\nbefore their characters are formed, and their judgment matured, they\nfrequently manifest a preference for associates who will have an\ninjurious influence over them. Some form attachments for the other\nsex, contrary to the wishes and entreaties of their parents, and break\nDangers of the Young 383\nthe fifth commandment by thus dishonoring them. It is the duty of\nparents to watch the going out and the coming in of their children.\nThey should encourage them, and present inducements before them\nwhich will attract them at home, and lead them to see that their\nparents are interested for them. They should make home pleasant\nand cheerful.\nFathers and mothers, speak kindly to your children; remember\nhow sensitive you are, how little you can bear to be blamed; reflect,\nand know that your children are like you. That which you cannot\nbear, do not lay upon them. If you cannot bear censure and blame,\nneither can your children, who are weaker than you and cannot\nendure as much. Let your pleasant, cheerful words ever be like\nsunbeams in your family. The fruits of self-control, thoughtfulness,\nand painstaking on your part will be a hundredfold. Parents have no\nright to bring a gloomy cloud over the happiness of their children\nby faultfinding or severe censure for trifling mistakes. Actual wrong\nand sin should be made to appear just as sinful as it is, and a firm,\ndecided course should be pursued to prevent its recurrence. Children\nshould be impressed with a sense of their wrongs, yet they should\nnot be left in a hopeless state of mind, but with a degree of courage\nthat they can improve and gain your confidence and approval.\nSome parents mistake in giving their children too much liberty.\nThey sometimes have so much confidence in them that they do not\nsee their faults. It is wrong to allow children, at some expense, to\nvisit at a distance, unaccompanied by their parents or guardians. It\nhas a wrong influence upon the children. They come to feel that they [402]\nare of considerable consequence and that certain privileges belong\nto them, and if these are not granted, they think themselves abused.\nThey refer to children who go and come, and have many privileges,\nwhile they have so few.\nAnd the mother, fearing that her children will think her unjust,\ngratifies their wishes, which in the end proves a great injury to them.\nYoung visitors, who have not a parent\u2019s watchful eye over them to\nsee and correct their faults, often receive impressions which it will\ntake months to remove. I was referred to cases of parents who had\ngood, obedient children, and who, having the utmost confidence in\ncertain families, trusted their children to go from them at a distance\nto visit these friends. From that time there was an entire change\n384 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin the deportment and character of their children. Formerly they\nwere contented and happy at home, and had no great desire to be\nmuch in the company of other young persons. When they return to\ntheir parents, restraint seems unjust, and home is like a prison to\nthem. Such unwise movements of parents decide the character of\ntheir children.\nBy thus visiting, some children form attachments which prove\ntheir ruin in the end. Parents, keep your children with you if you\ncan, and watch them with the deepest solicitude. When you let them\nvisit at a distance from you, they feel that they are old enough to\ntake care of and choose for themselves. When the young are thus\nleft to themselves, their conversation is often upon subjects which\nwill not refine or elevate them, or increase their love for the things\nof religion. The more they are permitted to visit, the greater will be\ntheir desire to go, and the less attractive will home seem to them.\nChildren, God has seen fit to entrust you to the care of your\nparents for them to instruct and discipline, and thus act their part in\nforming your character for heaven. And yet it rests with you to say\nwhether you will develop a good Christian character by making the\nbest of the advantages you have had from godly, faithful, praying[403]\nparents. Notwithstanding all the anxiety and faithfulness of parents\nin behalf of their children, they alone cannot save them. There is a\nwork for the children to do. Every child has an individual case to\nattend to. Believing parents, you have a responsible work before\nyou to guide the footsteps of your children, even in their religious\nexperience. When they truly love God, they will bless and reverence\nyou for the care which you have manifested for them, and for your\nfaithfulness in restraining their desires and subduing their wills.\nThe prevailing influence in the world is to suffer the youth to\nfollow the natural turn of their own minds. And if very wild in youth,\nparents say they will come right after a while, and when sixteen or\neighteen years of age, will reason for themselves, and leave off their\nwrong habits, and become at last useful men and women. What a\nmistake! For years they permit an enemy to sow the garden of the\nheart; they suffer wrong principles to grow, and in many cases all the\nlabor afterward bestowed on that soil will avail nothing. Satan is an\nartful, persevering workman, a deadly foe. Whenever an incautious\nword is spoken to the injury of youth, whether in flattery or to\nDangers of the Young 385\ncause them to look upon some sin with less abhorrence, Satan takes\nadvantage of it and nourishes the evil seed that it may take root and\nyield a bountiful harvest. Some parents have suffered their children\nto form wrong habits, the marks of which may be seen all through\nlife. Upon the parents lies this sin. These children may profess to\nbe Christians, yet without a special work of grace upon the heart\nand a thorough reform in life their past habits will be seen in all\ntheir experience, and they will exhibit just the character which their\nparents allowed them to form.\nThe standard of piety is so low among professed Christians\ngenerally that those who wish to follow Christ in sincerity find the\nwork much more laborious and trying than they otherwise would.\nThe influence of worldly professors is injurious to the young. The [404]\nmass of professed Christians have removed the line of distinction\nbetween Christians and the world, and while they profess to be living\nfor Christ, they are living for the world. Their faith has but little\nrestraining influence upon their pleasures; while they profess to be\nchildren of the light, they walk in darkness and are children of the\nnight and of darkness. Those who walk in darkness cannot love God\nand sincerely desire to glorify Him. They are not enlightened to\ndiscern the excellence of heavenly things, and therefore cannot truly\nlove them. They profess to be Christians because it is considered\nhonorable, and there is no cross for them to bear. Their motives\nare often selfish. Some such professors can enter the ballroom\nand unite in all the amusements which it affords. Others cannot\ngo to such a length as this, yet they can attend parties of pleasure,\npicnics, donation parties, and exhibitions. And the most discerning\neye would fail to detect in such professed Christians one mark of\nChristianity. One would fail to see in their appearance any difference\nbetween them and the greatest unbeliever. The professed Christian,\nthe profligate, the open scoffer at religion, and the openly profane\nall mingle together as one. And God regards them as one in spirit\nand practice.\nA profession of Christianity without corresponding faith and\nworks will avail nothing. No man can serve two masters. The\nchildren of the wicked one are their own master\u2019s servants; to whom\nthey yield themselves servants to obey, his servants they are, and\nthey cannot be the servants of God until they renounce the devil and\n386 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nall his works. It cannot be harmless for servants of the heavenly King\nto engage in the pleasures and amusements which Satan\u2019s servants\nengage in, even though they often repeat that such amusements are\nharmless. God has revealed sacred and holy truths to separate His\npeople from the ungodly and purify them unto Himself. Seventh-\nday Adventists should live out their faith. Those who obey the Ten[405]\nCommandments view the state of the world and religious things\nfrom a standpoint altogether different from that of professors who\nare lovers of pleasure, who shun the cross, and live in violation of\nthe fourth commandment. In the present state of things in society\nit is no easy task for parents to restrain their children and instruct\nthem according to the Bible rule of right. Professors of religion\nhave so departed from the word of God that when His people return\nto His sacred word, and would train their children according to its\nprecepts, and like Abraham of old command their households after\nthem, the poor children with such an influence around them think\ntheir parents unnecessarily exacting and overcareful in regard to their\nassociates. They naturally desire to follow the example of worldly,\npleasure-loving professors.\nIn these days, persecution and reproach for Christ\u2019s sake are\nscarcely known. Very little self-denial and sacrifice is necessary\nin order to put on a form of godliness and have the name upon the\nchurch book; but to live in such a manner that our ways will be\npleasing to God, and our names registered in the book of life, will\nrequire watchfulness and prayer, self-denial and sacrifice on our\npart. Professed Christians are no example for the youth, only as far\nas they follow Christ. Right actions are unmistakable fruits of true\ngodliness. The Judge of all the earth will give everyone according to\nhis works. Children who follow Christ have a warfare before them;\nthey have a daily cross to bear in coming out from the world and\nbeing separate, and imitating the life of Christ.\n* * * * *\nChapter 75\u2014Walk in the Light\nI was shown that God\u2019s people dwell too much under a cloud. It\nis not His will that they should live in unbelief. Jesus is light, and\nin Him is no darkness at all. His children are the children of light. [406]\nThey are renewed in His image, and called out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light. He is the light of the world, and so also are they\nthat follow Him. They shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the\nlight of life. The more closely the people of God strive to imitate\nChrist, the more perseveringly will they be pursued by the enemy;\nbut their nearness to Christ strengthens them to resist the efforts of\nour wily foe to draw them from Christ.\nI was shown that there was too much comparing ourselves among\nourselves, taking fallible mortals for a pattern, when we have a sure,\nunerring pattern. We should not measure ourselves by the world, nor\nby the opinions of men, nor by what we were before we embraced\nthe truth. But our faith and position in the world, as they now are,\nmust be compared with what they would have been if our course\nhad been continually onward and upward since we professed to be\nfollowers of Christ. This is the only safe comparison that can be\nmade. In every other there will be self-deception. If the moral\ncharacter and spiritual state of God\u2019s people do not correspond with\nthe blessings, privileges, and light which have been conferred upon\nthem, they are weighed in the balance, and angels make the report,\nWanting.\nWith some the knowledge of their true state seems to be hidden\nfrom them. They see the truth, but perceive not its importance\nor its claims. They hear the truth, but do not fully understand it,\nbecause they do not conform their lives to it, and therefore are not\nsanctified through obeying it. And yet they rest as unconcerned and\nwell satisfied as though the cloud by day and the pillar of fire by\nnight, as token of God\u2019s favor, went before them. They profess to\nknow God, but in works deny Him. They reckon themselves His\nchosen, peculiar people, yet His presence and power to save to the\n387\n388 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nuttermost are seldom manifested among them. How great is the\ndarkness of such! yet they know it not. The light shines, but they[407]\ndo not comprehend it. No stronger delusion can deceive the human\nmind than that which makes them believe that they are right, and\nthat God accepts their works, when they are sinning against Him.\nThey mistake the form of godliness for the spirit and power thereof.\nThey suppose that they are rich, and have need of nothing, when\nthey are poor, wretched, blind, and naked, and need all things.\nThere are some who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers, yet put\nforth no effort in spiritual things. In any worldly enterprise they\nput forth effort, and manifest ambition to accomplish their object,\nand bring about the desired end; but in the enterprise of everlasting\nlife, where all is at stake, and their eternal happiness depends upon\ntheir success, they act as indifferent as though they were not moral\nagents, as though another were playing the game of life for them,\nand they had nothing to do but wait the result. Oh, what folly! what\nmadness! If all will only manifest that degree of ambition, zeal, and\nearnestness for everlasting life that they manifest in their worldly\npursuits, they will be victorious overcomers. Everyone, I saw, must\nobtain an experience for himself, each must act well and faithfully\nhis part in the game of life. Satan watches his opportunity to seize\nthe precious graces when we are unguarded, and we shall have a\nsevere conflict with the powers of darkness to retain them, or to\nregain a heavenly grace if through lack of watchfulness we lose it.\nBut I was shown that it is the privilege of Christians to obtain\nstrength from God to hold every precious gift. Fervent and effectual\nprayer will be regarded in heaven. When the servants of Christ take\nthe shield of faith for their defense, and the sword of the Spirit for\nwar, there is danger in the enemy\u2019s camp, and something must be\ndone. Persecution and reproach only wait for those who are endowed\nwith power from on high to call them into action. When the truth in\nits simplicity and strength prevails among believers, and is brought [408]\nto bear against the spirit of the world, it will be evident that there is\nno concord between Christ and Belial. The disciples of Christ must\nbe living examples of the life and spirit of their Master.\nYoung and old have a conflict, a warfare, before them. They\nshould not sleep for a moment. A wily foe is constantly on the alert\nto lead them astray and overcome them. Believers in present truth\nWalk in the Light 389\nmust be as watchful as their enemy and manifest wisdom in resisting\nSatan. Will they do this? Will they persevere in this warfare? Will\nthey be careful to depart from all iniquity? Christ is denied in many\nways. We may deny Him by speaking contrary to truth, by speaking\nevil of others, by foolish talking or jesting, or by words that are\nidle. In these things we manifest but little shrewdness or wisdom.\nWe make ourselves weak; our efforts are feeble to resist our great\nenemy, and we are conquered. \u201cOut of the abundance of the heart\nthe mouth speaketh,\u201d and through lack of watchfulness we confess\nthat Christ is not in us. Those who hesitate to devote themselves\nunreservedly to God make poor work of following Christ. They\nfollow Him at so great a distance that half the time they do not really\nknow whether they are following His footprints or the footsteps of\ntheir great enemy. Why are we so slow to give up our interest in\nthe things of this world and take Christ for our only portion? Why\nshould we wish to keep the friendship of our Lord\u2019s enemies, and\nfollow their customs, and be led by their opinions? There must\nbe an entire, unreserved surrender to God, a forsaking and turning\naway from the love of the world and earthly things, or we cannot be\nChrist\u2019s disciples.\nThe life and spirit of Christ is the only standard of excellence\nand perfection, and our only safe course is to follow His example.\nIf we do this He will guide us by His counsel and afterward receive\nus to glory. We must strive diligently and be willing to suffer much\nin order to walk in the footsteps of our Redeemer. God is willing to [409]\nwork for us, to give us of His free Spirit, if we will strive for it, live\nfor it, believe for it; and then we can walk in the light as He is in the\nlight. We can feast upon His love and drink in of His rich fullness.\n* * * * *\nChapter 76\u2014The Cause in the East\nThe fanaticism which raged in years past has left its desolating\neffects in the East. I saw that God tested His people upon time in\n1844, but that no time which has since been set has borne the special\nmarks of His hand. He has not tested His people upon any particular\ntime since 1844. We have been, and still are, in the patient waiting\ntime. Considerable excitement was created by the 1854 time, and\nmany have settled it that that movement was in the order of God\nbecause it was quite extensive and some were apparently converted\nby it. But such conclusions are not necessary. There was much\npreached in connection with the time in 1854 that was reasonable\nand right. Some who were honest took truth and error together, and\nsacrificed much of what they possessed to carry out the error, and\nafter their disappointment they gave up both truth and error, and\nare now where it is very difficult for the truth to reach them. Some\nwho endured the disappointment have seen the evidences of present\ntruth, and have embraced the third angel\u2019s message, and are striving\nto carry it out in their lives. But where there is one who has been\nbenefited by believing the 1854 time, there are ten who have been\ninjured by it; and many of these are placed where they will not be\nconvinced of the truth, though it be presented before them ever so\nclearly.\nThe proclamation of the 1854 time was attended with a spirit\nwhich was not of God. It was a noisy, rough, careless, excitable\nspirit. Noise was considered by many the essential of true religion,[410]\nand there was a tendency to bring all down upon a low level. Many\nregarded this as humility; but when opposed in their peculiar views,\nthey would become excited in a moment, manifest an overbearing\nspirit, and accuse those who did not agree with them of being proud\nand of resisting the truth and the power of God.\nHoly angels have been displeased and disgusted with the irrev-\nerent manner in which many have used the name of God, the great\nJehovah. Angels mention that sacred name with the greatest awe,\n390\nCause in the East 391\never veiling their faces when they speak the name of God; and the\nname of Christ is so sacred to them that they speak it with the great-\nest reverence. But how opposite the spirit and influence attending the\n1854 time movement. Some who are still under the same influence\nspeak of God as they would of a horse or of any other commonplace\nthing. In their prayers they use the words God Almighty in a very\ncommon and irreverent manner. Those who do this have no sense of\nthe exalted character of God, of Christ, or of heavenly things.\nI was shown that when God sent His angels anciently to minister\nor communicate to individuals, and these persons learned that they\nhad seen and talked with an angel, they were struck with awe and\nwere afraid that they should die. They had so exalted views of the\nterrible majesty and power of God that they thought it would destroy\nthem to be brought into close connection with one direct from His\nholy presence. I was referred to Judges 13:21, 22: \u201cThen Manoah\nknew that he was an angel of the Lord. And Manoah said unto his\nwife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.\u201d Judges 6:22,\n23: \u201cAnd when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord,\nGideon said, Alas, O Lord God! for because I have seen an angel of\nthe Lord face to face. And the Lord said unto him, Peace be unto\nthee; fear not: thou shalt not die.\u201d Joshua 5:13-15: \u201cAnd it came\nto pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and [411]\nlooked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his\nsword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto\nhim, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And he said, Nay; but as\ncaptain of the host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on\nhis face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith\nmy Lord unto his servant? And the captain of the Lord\u2019s host said\nunto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon\nthou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.\u201d If angels were thus feared\nand honored because they came from the presence of God, with how\nmuch greater reverence should God Himself be regarded.\nMany who were converted through the influence of the 1854\nmovement need to be converted anew. And now tenfold more labor\nis required to correct the wrong, distracting views which they have\nreceived from their teachers, and to lead them to receive the truth\nunmixed with error, than would have been necessary to bring them\nout in the first place upon the third angel\u2019s message. This class must\n392 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nunlearn before they can learn aright, else the poisonous weeds of\nerror would grow rank and root out the precious seeds of truth. Error\nmust first be rooted up, then the soil is prepared for the good seed to\nspring up and bear fruit to the glory of God.\nThe only remedy for the East is thorough discipline and orga-\nnization. A spirit of fanaticism has ruled a certain class of Sab-\nbathkeepers there; they have sipped but lightly at the fountain of\ntruth and are unacquainted with the spirit of the message of the third\nangel. Nothing can be done for this class until their fanatical views\nare corrected. Some who were in the 1854 movement have brought\nalong with them erroneous views, such as the nonresurrection of the\nwicked, and the future age, and they are seeking to unite these views\nand their past experience with the message of the third angel. They\ncannot do this; there is no concord between Christ and Belial. The[412]\nnonresurrection of the wicked and their peculiar views of the age to\ncome are gross errors which Satan has worked in among the last-day\nheresies to serve his own purpose to ruin souls. These errors can\nhave no harmony with the message of heavenly origin.\nSome of these persons have exercises which they call gifts and\nsay that the Lord has placed them in the church. They have an\nunmeaning gibberish which they call the unknown tongue, which is\nunknown not only by man but by the Lord and all heaven. Such gifts\nare manufactured by men and women, aided by the great deceiver.\nFanaticism, false excitement, false talking in tongues, and noisy\nexercises have been considered gifts which God has placed in the\nchurch. Some have been deceived here. The fruits of all this have\nnot been good. \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits.\u201d Fanaticism and\nnoise have been considered special evidences of faith. Some are\nnot satisfied with a meeting unless they have a powerful and happy\ntime. They work for this and get up an excitement of feeling. But\nthe influence of such meetings is not beneficial. When the happy\nflight of feeling is gone, they sink lower than before the meeting\nbecause their happiness did not come from the right source. The\nmost profitable meetings for spiritual advancement are those which\nare characterized with solemnity and deep searching of heart; each\nseeking to know himself, and earnestly, and in deep humility, seeking\nto learn of Christ.\nCause in the East 393\nBrother Lunt of Portland, Maine, has suffered much in his feel-\nings. He has felt that the spirit which often ruled in their meetings\nwas not in harmony with the message of the third angel. He has had\nan experience in the fanaticism which has left desolation in the East,\nand this leads him to look with suspicion upon everything which\nappears like fanaticism. He has the past before him as a warning and\nhas felt like keeping aloof from, and speaking plainly with, those\nwho had any degree of fanaticism, for he felt that both they and the [413]\ncause of God were in danger. He has looked upon things in about\nthe right light.\nThere are many restless spirits who will not submit to discipline,\nsystem, and order. They think that their liberties would be abridged\nwere they to lay aside their own judgment and submit to the judgment\nof those of experience. The work of God will not progress unless\nthere is a disposition to submit to order and expel the reckless,\ndisorderly spirit of fanaticism from their meetings. Impressions and\nfeelings are no sure evidence that a person is led by the Lord. Satan\nwill, if he is unsuspected, give feelings and impressions. These are\nnot safe guides. All should thoroughly acquaint themselves with\nthe evidences of our faith, and the great study should be how they\ncan adorn their profession and bear fruit to the glory of God. None\nshould take a course to make themselves disgusting to unbelievers.\nWe should be chaste, modest, and elevated in conversation, and\nblameless in life. A trifling, joking, reckless spirit should be rebuked.\nIt is no evidence of the grace of God upon the heart for persons to\ntalk and pray with talent in meeting, and then give up to a rough,\ncareless manner of talking and acting when out of meeting. Such\nare miserable representatives of our faith; they are a reproach to the\ncause of God.\nThere is a strange mixture of views among professed Sabbath-\nkeepers in -----. Some are not in harmony with the body, and while\nthey continue to occupy the position they now do, they will be sub-\nject to the temptations of Satan and will be affected with fanaticism\nand the spirit of error. Some have fanciful views which blind their\neyes to important, vital points of truth, leading them to place their\nown fanciful inferences upon a level with vital truth. The appearance\nof such, and the spirit which attends them, makes the Sabbath which\nthey profess very objectionable to the sensible unbeliever. It would\n394 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbe far better for the progress and success of the third angel\u2019s message[414]\nif such persons would leave the truth.\nAccording to the light which God has given me, there will yet be\na large company raised up in the East to consistently obey the truth.\nThose who follow in the distracted course they have chosen will\nbe left to embrace errors which will finally cause their overthrow;\nbut they will for a time be stumbling blocks to those who would\nreceive the truth. Ministers who labor in word and doctrine should\nbe thorough workmen, and should present the truth in its purity, yet\nwith simplicity. They should feed the flock with clean provender,\nthoroughly winnowed. There are wandering stars professing to be\nministers sent of God who are preaching the Sabbath from place to\nplace, but who have truth mixed up with error and are throwing out\ntheir mass of discordant views to the people. Satan has pushed them\nin to disgust intelligent and sensible unbelievers. Some of these have\nmuch to say upon the gifts and are often especially exercised. They\ngive themselves up to wild, excitable feelings and make unintelli-\ngible sounds which they call the gift of tongues, and a certain class\nseem to be charmed with these strange manifestations. A strange\nspirit rules with this class, which would bear down and run over\nanyone who would reprove them. God\u2019s Spirit is not in the work and\ndoes not attend such workmen. They have another spirit. Still, such\npreachers have success among a certain class. But this will greatly\nincrease the labor of those servants whom God shall send, who are\nqualified to present before the people the Sabbath and the gifts in\ntheir proper light, and whose influence and example are worthy of\nimitation.\nThe truth should be presented in a manner which will make it\nattractive to the intelligent mind. We are not understood as a people,\nbut are looked upon as poor, weak-minded, low, and degraded. Then\nhow important for all who teach, and all who believe the truth,\nto be so affected by its sanctifying influence that their consistent,[415]\nelevated lives shall show unbelievers that they have been deceived\nin this people. How important that the cause of truth be stripped of\neverything like a false and fanatical excitement, that the truth may\nstand upon its own merits, revealing its native purity and exalted\ncharacter.\nCause in the East 395\nI saw that it is highly important for those who preach the truth\nto be refined in their manners, to shun oddities and eccentricities,\nand present the truth in its purity and clearness. I was referred to\nTitus 1:9: \u201cHolding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught,\nthat he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince\nthe gainsayers.\u201d In verse 16 Paul speaks of a class who profess that\nthey know God, but in works deny him, being \u201cunto every good\nwork reprobate.\u201d He then exhorts Titus: \u201cBut speak thou the things\nwhich become sound doctrine: that the aged men be sober, grave,\ntemperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.... Young men\nlikewise exhort to be sober-minded. In all things showing thyself a\npattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,\nsincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is\nof the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of\nyou.\u201d This instruction is written for the benefit of all whom God has\ncalled to preach the word, and also for the benefit of His people who\nhear the word.\nThe truth of God will never degrade, but will elevate the receiver,\nrefine his taste, sanctify his judgment, and perfect him for the com-\npany of the pure and holy angels in the kingdom of God. There are\nsome whom the truth finds coarse, rough, odd, boastful, who take\nadvantage of their neighbors if they can, in order to benefit them-\nselves; they err in many ways, yet when the truth is believed by them\nfrom the heart, it will work an entire change in their lives. They will\nimmediately commence the work of reformation. The pure influence\nof truth will elevate the whole man. In his business deal with his [416]\nfellow men he will have the fear of God before him, and will love his\nneighbor as himself, and will deal just as he would wish to be dealt\nby. His conversation will be truthful, chaste, and of so elevating a\ncharacter that unbelievers cannot take advantage of it, or say evil\nof him justly, and are not disgusted with his uncourteous ways and\nunbecoming speech. He will carry the sanctifying influence of the\ntruth into his family and let his light so shine before them that they\nby seeing his good works may glorify God. He will in all the walks\nof life exemplify the life of Christ.\nThe law of God will be satisfied with nothing short of perfection,\nof perfect and entire obedience to all its claims. To come halfway\nto its requirements, and not render perfect and thorough obedience,\n396 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwill avail nothing. The worldling and the infidel admire consistency\nand have ever been powerfully convicted that God was of a truth\nwith His people when their works correspond with their faith. \u201cBy\ntheir fruits ye shall know them.\u201d Every tree is known by its own\nfruits. Our words, our actions, are the fruit we bear. There are\nmany who hear the sayings of Christ, but do them not. They make a\nprofession, but their fruits are such as to disgust unbelievers. They\nare boastful, and pray and talk in a self-righteous manner, exalting\nthemselves, recounting their good deeds, and, like the Pharisee,\nvirtually thanking God that they are not as other men. Yet these\nvery ones are crafty, and overreach in business deal. Their fruits are\nnot good. Their words and acts are wrong, and yet they seem to be\nblinded to their destitute, wretched condition.\nI was shown that the following scripture is applicable to those\nwho are under such a deception: \u201cNot everyone that saith unto Me,\nLord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth\nthe will of My Father which is in heaven. Many will say to Me in\nthat day, Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in Thy name? and\nin Thy name have cast out devils? and in Thy name done many[417]\nwonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew\nyou: depart from Me, ye that work iniquity.\u201d\nHere is the greatest deception that can affect the human mind;\nthese persons believe that they are right when they are wrong. They\nthink that they are doing a great work in their religious life, but Jesus\nfinally tears off their self-righteous covering and vividly presents\nbefore them the true picture of themselves in all their wrongs and\ndeformity of religious character. They are found wanting when it\nis forever too late to have their wants supplied. God has provided\nmeans to correct the erring: yet if those who err, choose to follow\ntheir own judgment, and despise the means which He has ordained\nto correct them and unite them upon the truth, they will be brought\ninto the position described by the words of our Lord quoted above.\nGod is bringing out a people and preparing them to stand as one,\nunited, to speak the same things, and thus carry out the prayer of\nChrist for His disciples. \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them\nalso which shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may\nbe one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may\nbe one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d\nCause in the East 397\nThere are little companies continually rising who believe that\nGod is only with the very few, the very scattered, and their influ-\nence is to tear down and scatter that which God\u2019s servants build\nup. Restless minds who want to be seeing and believing something\nnew continually are constantly rising, some in one place and some\nin another, all doing a special work for the enemy, yet claiming to\nhave the truth. They stand separate from the people whom God is\nleading out and prospering, and through whom He is to do His great\nwork. They are continually expressing their fears that the body of\nSabbathkeepers are becoming like the world, but there are scarcely\ntwo of these whose views are in harmony. They are scattered and [418]\nconfused, and yet deceive themselves so much as to think that God is\nespecially with them. Some of these profess to have the gifts among\nthem; but are led by the influence and teachings of these gifts to\nhold in doubt those upon whom God has laid the special burden of\nHis work, and to lead off a class from the body. The people, who, in\naccordance with God\u2019s word, are putting forth every effort to be one,\nwho are established in the message of the third angel, are looked\nupon with suspicion for the reason that they are extending their labor\nand are gathering souls into the truth. They are considered worldly\nbecause they have an influence in the world, and their acts testify\nthat they expect God yet to do a special and great work upon the\nearth, to bring out a people and fit them for Christ\u2019s appearing.\nThis class do not know what they really believe, or the reasons\nfor their belief. They are ever learning, and never able to come to the\nknowledge of the truth. One man arises with wild, erroneous views,\nand claims that God has sent him with new and glorious light, and\nall must believe what he brings. Some who have no established faith,\nwho are not subject to the body, but are drifting about without an\nanchor to hold them, receive that wind of doctrine. His light shines\nin such a manner as to cause the world to turn from him in disgust\nand to hate him. Then he blasphemously places himself by the side\nof Christ and claims that the world hate him for the same reason\nthat they hated Christ. Another rises, claiming to be led of God, and\nadvocates the heresy of the nonresurrection of the wicked, which\nis one of Satan\u2019s great masterpieces of error. Another cherishes\nerroneous views in regard to the future age. Another zealously urges\nthe American costume. They all want full religious liberty, and\n398 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\neach acts independent of the others, and yet they claim that God is\nespecially at work among them.\nSome rejoice and exult that they have the gifts, which others have[419]\nnot. May God deliver His people from such gifts. What do these gifts\ndo for them? Are they through the exercise of these gifts, brought\ninto the unity of the faith? And do they convince the unbeliever\nthat God is with them of a truth? When these discordant ones,\nholding their different views, come together and there is considerable\nexcitement and the unknown tongue, they let their light so shine that\nunbelievers would say: These people are not sane; they are carried\naway with a false excitement, and we know that they do not have\nthe truth. Such stand directly in the way of sinners; their influence\nis effectual to keep others from accepting the Sabbath. Such will\nbe rewarded according to their works. Would to God they would be\nreformed or give up the Sabbath! They would not then stand in the\nway of unbelievers.\nGod has led out men who have toiled for years, who have been\nwilling to make any sacrifice, who have suffered privation, and\nendured trials to bring the truth before the world, and by their consis-\ntent course remove the reproach that fanatics have brought upon the\ncause of God. They have met opposition in every form. They have\ntoiled night and day in searching the evidences of our faith that they\nmight bring out the truth in its clearness, in a connected form, that\nit might withstand all opposition. Incessant labor and mental trials\nin connection with this great work have worn down more than one\nconstitution and prematurely sprinkled heads with gray hairs. They\nhave not worn out in vain. God has marked their earnest, tearful,\nagonizing prayers that they might have light and truth, and that the\ntruth might shine in its clearness to others. He has marked their\nself-sacrificing efforts, and He will reward them as their works have\nbeen.\nOn the other hand, those who have not toiled to bring out these\nprecious truths have come up and received some points, like the\nSabbath truth, which are all prepared to their hand, and then all the\ngratitude they manifest for that which cost them nothing, but others[420]\nso much, is to rise up like Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and reproach\nthose upon whom God has laid the burden of His work. They would\nsay: \u201cYe take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are\nCause in the East 399\nholy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them.\u201d They are\nstrangers to gratitude. They possess a strong spirit which will not\nyield to reason and which will lead them on to their own destruction.\nGod has blessed His people who have moved forward following\nHis opening providence. He has brought out a people from every\nclass upon the great platform of truth. Infidels have been convinced\nthat God was with His people and have humbled their hearts to obey\nthe truth. The work of God moves steadily on. Yet notwithstanding\nall the evidences that God has been leading the body, there are, and\nwill continue to be, those who profess the Sabbath, who will move\nindependent of the body, and believe and act as they choose. Their\nviews are confused. Their scattered state is a standing testimony\nthat God is not with them. By the world the Sabbath and their errors\nare placed upon a level and thrown away together. God is angry\nwith those who pursue a course to make the world hate them. If\na Christian is hated because of his good works and for following\nChrist, he will have a reward; but if he is hated because he does\nnot take a course to be loved, hated because of his uncultivated\nmanners and because he makes the truth a matter of quarrel with his\nneighbors, and takes a course to make the Sabbath as annoying as\npossible to them, he is a stumbling block to sinners, a reproach to\nthe sacred truth, and unless he repents it were better for him that a\nmillstone were hung about his neck and he were cast into the sea.\nNo occasion should be given to unbelievers to reproach our faith.\nWe are considered odd and singular, and should not take a course to\nlead unbelievers to think us more so than our faith requires us to be.\nSome who believe the truth may think that it would be more [421]\nhealthful for the sisters to adopt the American costume, yet if that\nmode of dress would cripple our influence among unbelievers so\nthat we could not so readily gain access to them, we should by no\nmeans adopt it, though we suffered much in consequence. But some\nare deceived in thinking there is so much benefit to be received from\nthis costume. While it may prove a benefit to some, it is an injury to\nothers. [See Appendix.]\nI saw that God\u2019s order has been reversed, and His special di-\nrections disregarded, by those who adopt the American costume. I\nwas referred to Deuteronomy 22:5: \u201cThe woman shall not wear that\nwhich pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u2019s\n400 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngarment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.\u201d\nGod would not have His people adopt the so-called reform dress. It is\nimmodest apparel, wholly unfitted for the modest, humble followers\nof Christ.\nThere is an increasing tendency to have women in their dress\nand appearance as near like the other sex as possible, and to fash-\nion their dress very much like that of men, but God pronounces it\nabomination. \u201cIn like manner also, that women adorn themselves in\nmodest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9.\nThose who feel called out to join the movement in favor of\nwoman\u2019s rights and the so-called dress reform might as well sever all\nconnection with the third angel\u2019s message. The spirit which attends\nthe one cannot be in harmony with the other. The Scriptures are plain\nupon the relations and rights of men and women. Spiritualists have,\nto quite an extent, adopted this singular mode of dress. Seventh-day\nAdventists, who believe in the restoration of the gifts, are often\nbranded as spiritualists. Let them adopt this costume, and their\ninfluence is dead. The people would place them on a level with\nspiritualists and would refuse to listen to them.\nWith the so-called dress reform there goes a spirit of levity and[422]\nboldness just in keeping with the dress. Modesty and reserve seem\nto depart from many as they adopt that style of dress. I was shown\nthat God would have us take a course consistent and explainable.\nLet the sisters adopt the American costume and they would destroy\ntheir own influence and that of their husbands. They would become\na byword and a derision. Our Saviour says: \u201cYe are the light of the\nworld.\u201d \u201cLet your light so shine before men, that they may see your\ngood works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d There is\na great work for us to do in the world, and God would not have us\ntake a course to lessen or destroy our influence with the world.\n* * * * *\nChapter 77\u2014The Prayer of David\nI was shown David entreating the Lord not to forsake him when\nhe should be old, and what it was that called forth his earnest prayer.\nHe saw that most of the aged around him were unhappy and that\nunhappy traits of character increased especially with age. If persons\nwere naturally close and covetous, they were most disagreeably so\nin their old age. If they were jealous, fretful, and impatient, they\nwere especially so when aged.\nDavid was distressed as he saw that kings and nobles who seemed\nto have the fear of God before them while in the strength of manhood,\nbecame jealous of their best friends and relatives when aged. They\nwere in continual fear that it was selfish motives which led their\nfriends to manifest an interest for them. They would listen to the\nhints and the deceptive advice of strangers in regard to those in whom\nthey should confide. Their unrestrained jealousy sometimes burned\ninto a flame because all did not agree with their failing judgment.\nTheir covetousness was dreadful. They often thought that their own [423]\nchildren and relatives were wishing them to die in order to take their\nplace and possess their wealth, and receive the homage which had\nbeen bestowed upon them. And some were so controlled by their\njealous, covetous feelings as to destroy their own children.\nDavid marked that although the lives of some while in the\nstrength of manhood had been righteous, as old age came upon\nthem they seemed to lose their self-control. Satan stepped in and\nguided their minds, making them restless and dissatisfied. He saw\nthat many of the aged seemed forsaken of God and exposed them-\nselves to the ridicule and reproaches of his enemies. David was\ndeeply moved; he was distressed as he looked forward to the time\nwhen he should be aged. He feared that God would leave him and\nthat he would be as unhappy as other aged persons whose course\nhe had noticed, and would be left to the reproach of the enemies\nof the Lord. With this burden upon him he earnestly prays: \u201cCast\nme not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength\n401\n402 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfaileth.\u201d \u201cO God, Thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto\nhave I declared Thy wondrous works. Now also when I am old\nand gray-headed, O God, forsake me not; until I have showed Thy\nstrength unto this generation, and Thy power to everyone that is to\ncome.\u201d Psalm 71:9, 17, 18. David felt the necessity of guarding\nagainst the evils which attend old age.\nIt is frequently the case that aged persons are unwilling to realize\nand acknowledge that their mental strength is failing. They shorten\ntheir days by taking care which belongs to their children. Satan\noften plays upon their imagination and leads them to feel a continual\nanxiety in regard to their money. It is their idol, and they hoard it\nwith miserly care. They will sometimes deprive themselves of many\nof the comforts of life, and labor beyond their strength, rather than\nuse the means which they have. In this way they place themselves in\ncontinual want, through fear that sometime in the future they shall[424]\nwant. All these fears originate with Satan. He excites the organs\nwhich lead to slavish fears and jealousies which corrupt nobleness\nof soul and destroy elevated thoughts and feelings. Such persons are\ninsane upon the subject of money. If they would take the position\nwhich God would have them, their last days might be their best and\nhappiest. Those who have children in whose honesty and judicious\nmanagement they have reason to confide, should let their children\nmake them happy. Unless they do this, Satan will take advantage of\ntheir lack of mental strength and will manage for them. They should\nlay aside anxiety and burdens, and occupy their time as happily as\nthey can, and be ripening up for heaven.\n* * * * *\nChapter 78\u2014Extremes in Dress\nWe do not think it in accordance with our faith to dress in the\nAmerican costume, to wear hoops, or to go to an extreme in wearing\nlong dresses which sweep the sidewalks and streets. If women would\nwear their dresses so as to clear the filth of the streets an inch or\ntwo, their dresses would be modest, and they could be kept clean\nmuch more easily, and would wear longer. Such a dress would be\nin accordance with our faith. I have received several letters from\nsisters inquiring my opinion in regard to wearing corded skirts.\nThese questions were answered in a letter which I sent to a sister in\nWisconsin. I will give the letter here for the benefit of others:\n\u201cWe as a people do not believe it our duty to go out of the world\nto be out of the fashion. If we have a neat, plain, modest, and\ncomfortable plan of dress, and worldlings choose to dress as we do,\nshall we change this mode of dress in order to be different from the\nworld? No, we should not be odd or singular in our dress for the [425]\nsake of differing from the world, lest they despise us for so doing.\nChristians are the light of the world, the salt of the earth. Their dress\nshould be neat and modest, their conversation chaste and heavenly,\nand their deportment blameless.\n\u201cHow shall we dress? If any wore heavy quilts before the intro-\nduction of hoops, merely for show and not for comfort, they sinned\nagainst themselves by injuring their health, which it is their duty\nto preserve. If any wear them now merely to look like hoops, they\ncommit sin; for they are seeking to imitate a fashion which is dis-\ngraceful. Corded skirts were worn before hoops were introduced.\nI have worn a light corded skirt since I was fourteen years of age,\nnot for show but for comfort and decency. Because hoops were\nintroduced I did not lay off my corded skirt for them. Shall I now\nthrow it aside because the fashion of hoops is introduced? No; that\nwould be carrying the matter to an extreme.\n\u201cI should ever bear in mind that I must be an example and there-\nfore must not run into this or that fashion, but pursue an even and\n403\n404 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nindependent course and not be driven to extremes in regard to dress.\nTo throw off my corded skirt that was always modest and comfort-\nable, and put on a thin cotton skirt, and thus appear ridiculous in the\nother extreme, would be wrong, for then I would not set a right ex-\nample, but would put an argument into the mouths of hoop wearers.\nTo justify themselves for wearing hoops they would point to me as\none who does not wear them, and say that they would not disgrace\nthemselves in that way. By going to such extremes we would destroy\nall the influence which we might otherwise have had, and lead the\nwearers of hoops to justify their course. We must dress modestly,\nwithout the least regard to the hoop fashion.\n\u201cThere is a medium position in these things. Oh, that we all\nmight wisely find that position and keep it. In this solemn time let us\nall search our own hearts, repent of our sins, and humble ourselves[426]\nbefore God. The work is between God and our own souls. It is an\nindividual work, and all will have enough to do without criticizing\nthe dress, actions, and motives of their brethren and sisters. \u2018Seek\nye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought His\njudgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall\nbe hid in the day of the Lord\u2019s anger.\u2019 Here is our work. It is not\nsinners who are here addressed, but all the meek of the earth, who\nhave wrought His judgments or kept His commandments. There is\nwork for everyone, and if all will obey, we shall see sweet union in\nthe ranks of Sabbathkeepers.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 79\u2014Communications to Elder Hull\n[The General Conference Committee would here express their\napproval of the publication of this Testimony. Especially do we\nrecommend the publication of the letters addressed to elder hull and\ngiven to him at the time of their dates. We call the particular attention\nof the reader to the declaration on page 442. It is there stated that\nElder Hull needed to be led as a blind man who depends on another\nfor sight. At the General Conference in Battle Creek, May, 1863,\nElder Hull acknowledged the justness of the statement, but has since\nprotested against it. The Committee now maintain that his course\nin the short space of the past four months, in abandoning every\npoint of religious faith dear to us as a people, is a most palpable\ndemonstration of the correctness of the above statement that he\nshould follow the counsel of his brethren. Gen. Conf. Com.]\nNovember 5, 1862, I was shown the condition of Brother Hull.\nHe was in an alarming state. His lack of consecration and vital piety\nleft him subject to Satan\u2019s suggestions. He has relied upon his own\nstrength instead of the strong arm of the Lord, and that mighty arm\nhas been partially removed.\nI was shown that the most alarming feature in the case of Brother\nHull is that he is asleep to his danger. He feels no alarm, feels per-\nfectly secure and at rest, while Satan and his angels are exulting over [427]\ntheir conquest. Just as long as Brother Hull maintained a conflict,\nhis mind was reined up, and there was a collision of spirits. He has\nnow ceased the conflict, and the collision ceases. His mind is at rest,\nand Satan lets him have peace. Oh, how dangerous was the position\nin which he was shown me! His case is nearly hopeless, because\nhe makes no effort to resist Satan and extricate himself from his\ndreadful snare.\nBrother Hull has been dealt with faithfully. He has felt that\nhe was too much restrained, that he could not act out his nature.\nWhile the power of the truth, in all its force, influenced him, he was\ncomparatively safe; but break the force and power of truth upon the\n405\n406 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmind, and there is no restraint, the natural propensities take the lead,\nand there is no stopping place. He has become tired of the conflict,\nand has for some time wished that he could more freely act himself,\nand has felt hurt at the reproofs of his brethren. He was presented to\nme as standing upon the brink of an awful gulf, ready to leap. If he\ntakes the leap, it will be final; his eternal destiny will be fixed. He\nis doing work and making decisions for eternity. The work of God\nis not dependent upon Brother Hull. If he leaves the ranks of those\nwho bear the bloodstained banner of Prince Immanuel, and joins the\ncompany who bear the black banner, it will be his own loss, his own\neternal destruction.\nI saw that those who wish can have plenty of room to doubt the\ninspiration and truth of God\u2019s word. God compels none to believe.\nThey can choose to rely upon the evidences which He has been\npleased to give, or doubt and perish. It is life or death with you,\nBrother Hull. Already I saw a cloud of evil angels surrounding you,\nand you at perfect ease among them. Satan has been telling you a\npleasing story about an easier way than to be in constant warfare\nwith conflicting spirits; but if you choose that way, you will find in\nthe end that you will have a heavy and fearful toll to pay.\nI saw that you have felt strong in yourself, felt that you had[428]\narguments which could not be gainsaid, and you have not relied\nupon the strength of the Lord. You have too often rushed upon\nSatan\u2019s ground to meet an opponent. You have not waited until you\nknew that the truth or the cause of God demanded a discussion, but\nhave engaged with opponents where with a little forethought you\nwould have decided that the truth could not be advanced or the cause\nof God benefited. Precious time has thus been spent.\nSatan looked on and witnessed the heavy blow which Brother\nHull dealt to spiritualism in Battle Creek. Spiritualists understood\nhis organization, and felt assured it would not be in vain to make a\ndetermined effort to overthrow him who injured their cause so much.\nIn discussing with spiritualists you have not merely to meet man and\nhis arguments, but Satan and his angels. And never should one man\nbe sent forth alone to combat with a spiritualist. If the cause of God\nreally demands that we confront Satan and his host as represented by\na spiritual medium, if enough is at stake to call for such a discussion,\nthen several should go forth together that with prayer and faith the\nCommunications to Elder Hull 407\nhost of darkness may be driven back and the speaker shielded by\nangels that excel in strength.\nBrother Hull, you were shown me under the soothing influence\nof a fascination which will prove fatal unless the spell is broken. You\nhave parleyed with Satan, and reasoned with him, and tarried upon\nforbidden ground, and have exercised your mind in things which\nwere too great for you, and by indulging in doubts and unbelief\nhave attracted evil angels around you, and driven from you the pure\nand holy angels of God. If you had steadfastly resisted Satan\u2019s\nsuggestions and sought strength from God with a determined effort,\nyou would have broken every fetter, driven back your spiritual foe,\ncome closer to God, and triumphed in His name. I saw that it was\npresumption in you to go forth to meet a spiritualist when you were [429]\nyourself enshrouded and bewildered by clouds of unbelief. You went\nto battle with Satan and his host without an armor, and have been\ngrievously wounded, and are insensible to your wound. I greatly fear\nthat the thunders and lightnings of Sinai would fail to move you. You\nare in Satan\u2019s easy chair and do not see your fearful condition and\nmake an effort to escape. If you do not arouse and recover yourself\nfrom the snare of the devil, you must perish. The brethren and sisters\nwould save you, but I saw that they could not. You have something\nto do; you have a desperate effort to make, or you are lost. I saw that\nthose who are under the bewitching influence of spiritualism know it\nnot. You have been charmed and mesmerized, yet you do not know\nit, and therefore do not make the least effort to come to the light.\nI saw that we are now in the shaking time. Satan is working with\nall his power to wrest souls from the hand of Christ and cause them to\ntrample underfoot the Son of God. An angel slowly and emphatically\nrepeated these words: \u201cOf how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,\nshall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son of\nGod, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was\nsanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of\ngrace?\u201d Character is being developed. Angels of God are weighing\nmoral worth. God is testing and proving His people. These words\nwere presented to me by the angel: \u201cTake heed, brethren, lest there\nbe in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the\nliving God. But exhort one another daily, while it is called today;\nlest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. For\n408 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwe are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our\nconfidence steadfast unto the end.\u201d God is displeased that any of His\npeople who have known the power of His grace should talk their\ndoubts, and by thus doing make themselves a channel for Satan to\ntransmit his suggestions to other minds. A seed of unbelief and evil[430]\nsown is not readily rooted up. Satan nourishes it every hour, and\nit flourishes and becomes strong. A good seed sown needs to be\nnourished, watered, and tenderly cared for; because every poisonous\ninfluence is thrown about it to hinder its growth and cause it to die.\nSatan\u2019s efforts are more powerful now than ever before, for he\nknows that his time to deceive is short. Brother Hull, I saw that you\nhad injured yourself greatly by exposing your weakness and telling\nyour doubts to those who are Satan\u2019s agents. You have been deceived\nby soft words and fair speeches, and have exposed yourself in a most\nreckless manner to the attacks of Satan. How could you thus wound\nyourself and reproach God\u2019s word? You have recklessly rushed upon\nSatan\u2019s battleground, and it is no marvel that your mind is so stupid\nand unfeeling. Already has Satan through his agents poisoned the\natmosphere you breathe; already have evil angels telegraphed to his\nagents upon earth in regard to the course to be pursued toward you.\nAnd this is one whom God has called to stand between the living\nand the dead; this is one of the watchmen stationed upon the walls\nof Zion to tell the people the time of night. A heavy responsibility\nrests upon you. If you go down, you will not go alone; for Satan\nwill employ you as his agent to lead souls to death.\nI saw that angels of God were looking sorrowfully toward you.\nThey had left your side and were turning mournfully away, while\nSatan and his angels were grinning in exultation over you. If you\nhad yourself battled with your doubts and not encouraged the devil\nto tempt you, by talking out your unbelief and loving to dwell upon\nit, you would not have attracted the fallen angels about you in such\nnumbers. But you chose to talk your darkness; you chose to dwell\nupon it; and the more you talk and dwell upon it, the darker and\ndarker you grow. You are shutting out from you every ray of heaven\u2019s\nlight; and a great gulf is coming between you and the only ones who[431]\ncan help you. If you proceed in the way you have started, misery\nand woe are before you. God\u2019s hand will arrest you in a manner that\nwill not suit you. His wrath will not slumber. But now He invites\nCommunications to Elder Hull 409\nyou. Now, just now, He calls upon you to return unto Him without\ndelay, and He will graciously pardon and heal all your backslidings.\nGod is leading out a people who are peculiar. He will cleanse and\npurify them, and fit them for translation. Every carnal thing will be\nseparated from God\u2019s peculiar treasures until they shall be like gold\nseven times purified.\nI saw that it was a cruel position for Brethren A and B to be in,\nto be serving the purposes of Satan by suffering their minds to run\njust as he would lead them in the channel of unbelief. Their greatest\nsin was in talking out these dark doubts, this midnight unbelief, and\ndrawing other minds into the same dark channel.\nGod\u2019s people will be sifted, even as corn is sifted in a sieve,\nuntil all the chaff is separated from the pure kernels of grain. We\nare to look to Christ for an example and imitate the humble pattern.\nYou do not feel reconciled to the discipline you need and do not\nexercise and practice that self-denial which Christ requires of those\nwho are truly heirs of salvation. Those who are engaged in the\nwork of saving souls are co-workers with Christ. His was a work\nof disinterested benevolence, of constant self-sacrifice. Those who\nhave had so great a sacrifice made for them that they might become\npartakers of His heavenly grace should in their turn sacrifice and\ndeny self to aid in the great work of bringing others to the knowledge\nof the truth. Self-interest should be laid aside; selfish desires and\nself-comfort should not now stand in the way of God\u2019s work in\nsaving souls. God\u2019s ministers are laboring in Christ\u2019s stead; they are\nHis ambassadors. They are not to study their ease, comfort, pleasure,\ndesires, or convenience. They must suffer for Christ, be crucified\nwith Him, and rejoice that they can in every sense of the word know [432]\nthe fellowship of the sufferings of Christ.\nI saw that ministers who labor in word and doctrine have a great\nwork before them; a heavy responsibility rests upon them. In their\nlabor they do not come close enough to hearts. Their work is too\ngeneral, and often too scattered. Their labor must be concentrated\nto the very ones for whom they are laboring. When they preach\nfrom the desk, they only commence their work. They must then live\nout their preaching, ever guarding themselves, that they bring not a\nreproach upon the cause of God. They should illustrate by example\nthe life of Christ. 1 Corinthians 3:9: \u201cFor we are laborers together\n410 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwith God.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:1: \u201cWe then, as workers together with\nHim, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.\u201d\nThe minister\u2019s work is not done when he leaves the desk. He should\nnot then throw off the burden and occupy his mind with reading\nor writing unless this is actually necessary. He should follow up\nhis public labors by private efforts, laboring personally for souls\nwhenever an opportunity presents, conversing around the fireside,\nbeseeching and entreating souls in Christ\u2019s stead to be reconciled to\nGod. Our work here is soon to close, \u201cand every man shall receive\nhis own reward according to his own labor.\u201d\nI was shown the saints\u2019 reward, the immortal inheritance. Then I\nwas shown how much God\u2019s people had endured for the truth\u2019s sake,\nand that they would count heaven cheap enough. They reckoned that\nthe sufferings of this present time were not worthy to be compared\nwith the glory which should be revealed in them. The people of God\nin these last days will be tried. But soon their last trial will come,\nand then they will receive the gift of eternal life.\nBrother Hull, you have suffered reproach for the truth\u2019s sake.\nYou have felt the power of the truth and of an endless life. You\nhave had God\u2019s Spirit witness with yours that you were owned and[433]\naccepted of Him. I saw that if you gird on the armor anew, and stand\nat your post, resisting the devil and fighting manfully the battles of\nthe Lord, you will be victorious, and will soon lay off your armor and\nwear a conqueror\u2019s crown. Oh, is not the inheritance rich enough?\nDid it not cost a dear price, the agony and blood of the Son of God?\nI call upon you in the name of the Lord to awake. Break away from\nthe awful deception which Satan has thrown over you. Lay hold\non everlasting life. Resist the devil. Evil angels are around you,\nwhispering in your ears, visiting you with lying dreams, and you\nlisten to them and are pleased. Oh, for the sake of Christ, for your\nown soul\u2019s sake, tear away from this dreadful influence before you\ngrieve God\u2019s Spirit entirely from you.\n* * * * *\nSabbath, June 6, 1863, I was shown some things in regard to the\nwork of God and the spread of the truth. Preachers and people have\ntoo little faith, too little devotion and true godliness. The people\nCommunications to Elder Hull 411\nimitate the preacher, and thus he has a very great influence upon\nthem. Brother Hull, God wants you to come nearer to Him, where\nyou can take hold of His strength, and by living faith claim His\nsalvation, and be a strong man. If you were a devotional, godly\nman, in the pulpit and out, a mighty influence would attend your\npreaching. You do not closely search your own heart. You have\nstudied many works to make your discourses thorough, able, and\npleasing; but you have neglected the greatest and most necessary\nstudy, the study of yourself. A thorough knowledge of yourself,\nmeditation and prayer, have come in as secondary things. Your\nsuccess as a minister depends upon your keeping your own heart.\nYou will receive more strength by spending one hour each day in\nmeditation, and in mourning over your failings and heart corruptions\nand pleading for God\u2019s pardoning love and the assurance of sins [434]\nforgiven, than you would by spending many hours and days in\nstudying the most able authors, and making yourself acquainted with\nevery objection to our faith, and with the most powerful evidences\nin its favor.\nThe reason why our preachers accomplish so little is that they\ndo not walk with God. He is a day\u2019s journey from most of them.\nThe more closely you watch your own heart, the more watchful\nand guarded you will be, lest by your words or acts you dishonor\nthe truth, give occasion for the tongue of slander to follow you\nand the truth, and cause souls to be lost through your neglect of\nself-examination, of heart study, and of vital godliness. The holy\ndeportment of the minister of Christ should be a rebuke to vain,\nfrothy professors. The beams of truth and holiness shining from\nyour serious, heavenly conversation will convict others and lead\nthem to the truth, and those around you will be compelled to say,\nGod is with this man, of a truth. It is the carelessness and looseness\nof professed ministers of Christ that gives them so little influence.\nThere are many professors, but there are few praying men. If our\npreachers were men who prayed more in secret, who carried their\npreaching into practice in their families, who ruled their houses with\ndignity and gravity, their light would indeed shine to those around\nthem.\nBrother Hull, I have been shown that if you would dedicate\nyourself to God, hold communion with Him, meditate much, watch\n412 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nyour failings, mourn and lament before the Lord in the deepest\nhumility on account of them, relying upon Him for strength, you\nwould be in the most profitable business in which you were ever\nengaged; for you would be drinking at a living fountain, and could\nthen give others to drink from that same fountain which revived and\nstrengthened you.\nDear brother, unless there is a change in your Christian character,\nyou will fail of everlasting life; for our busy foe will lay his snares\nfor your feet, and if you are not near to God, you will fall into the\nnet. You feel restless and uneasy, and study is your element; but you[435]\nsometimes fail in the subject. When you should be studying your\nown heart, you are engaged in reading books. When you should by\nfaith be drawing near to Christ, you are studying books. I saw that\nall your study will be useless unless you faithfully study yourself.\nYou are not acquainted with yourself, and your mind dwells but\nlittle upon God. You are self-confident, and pass along without\nknowing that self must die if you would be a successful minister of\nChrist. You lack sobriety and gravity out of the pulpit. These things\ncounteract your pulpit labor.\nEver since your case was first presented to me in vision, I have\nseen a lack in you. Your mind is not elevated. You stand in the desk\nand handle the most holy, sacred, elevating truths in an able manner;\nbut when treating upon the most solemn subjects, you often bring\nin something comical to create a smile, and this frequently destroys\nthe force of your whole discourse. You handle solemn truths with\nease, but do not live them, and that is the reason why the heavenly\nendorsement is lacking. Many whose ears you have pleased will talk\nof the smart discourse, the able preacher, but are no more impressed\nwith the necessity of obeying the truth than before they listened to it.\nThey go on transgressing God\u2019s law as before. It was the minister\nthat pleased them, not the truths which he uttered. You remain at so\ngreat a distance from God that His power does not set home the truth.\nYou should live religion at home, and it would have an influence to\nelevate your family, to elevate your wife. When at home you throw\noff restraint and act like a boy; the weight of the truth and the burden\nof the work do not rest upon you. You are not choice of your words\nor of your example.\nCommunications to Elder Hull 413\nYour only safety is in studying yourself, your weakness and\nfailings. Do not cease to guard yourself. Watch yourself more\nclosely when at home. Watch yourself when away from home. You\nneglect your closet duties, lay off your armor, and give up to a spirit\nof recklessness that drives angels from you and from your family. [436]\nDo not neglect to search your own heart at home. Lavish not all your\naffections upon your family. Preserve your heart\u2019s best affections to\ndevote to Jesus, who has redeemed you by His blood. When at home,\nbe fitting up all the time for your Master\u2019s business when you shall\nbe away from home. If you do this, you will have on the armor every\nmoment. Your soul\u2019s highest desire will be to glorify God, to do\nHis will upon earth, and you will have sweet confidence and trust in\nHim. You will not feel so restless, but will have a constant theme for\nmeditation, devotion, and holiness. I was referred to 1 Corinthians\n9:27: \u201cBut I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest\nthat by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should\nbe a castaway.\u201d You have a work to do to understand yourself. Be\nnot flattered by remarks which unwise and foolish brethren may\nmake concerning your efforts. If they praise your preaching, let it\nnot elate you. If God\u2019s blessing attends your labors, fruits will be\nseen. Your preaching will not merely please, but will gather in souls.\nBrother Hull, you must be guarded on every side. I saw that\nwhatever divides the affections, or takes away from the heart supreme\nlove for God, or prevents unlimited confidence and entire trust in\nHim, assumes the character and takes the form of an idol. I was\npointed to the first great commandment: \u201cThou shalt love the Lord\nthy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy\nmind.\u201d There is allowed no separation of our affections from God.\nNothing is to divide our supreme love for Him or our delight in\nHim. Your will, wishes, plans, desires, and pleasures must all be in\nsubjection. You have something to learn, to exalt the Lord God in\nyour heart, in your conversation, in all your acts; and then Jesus can\nteach you, and help you, as you cast your net on the right side of the\nship, to bring it to shore full of fishes. But without the help of Christ\nin casting your net, you may toil weeks, months, and years without [437]\nseeing much fruit of your labor.\nI saw that you would be tempted to feel that your brethren want\nto gauge you, that they want to put too much restraint upon you. But\n414 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nyour brethren only want you to live according to the instructions\nof God\u2019s word, and God wishes to bring you there, and angels are\nwatching you with the deepest solicitude. You must conform your\nlife to the word of God, that you may be blessed and strengthened of\nHim, or you will fall out by the way, and while you preach to others,\nyou yourself will be a castaway. But you may be an overcomer, and\nmay win eternal life. You are recovering yourself from the snare of\nSatan, but he is preparing other snares for you. God will help and\nstrengthen you if you seek Him earnestly. But study yourself. Try\nevery motive; let it not be your aim to preach brilliant discourses to\nexhibit Moses Hull, but seek to exhibit Christ. Simplify the truth\nto your hearers so that small minds may comprehend it. Make\nyour discourses plain, pointed, and solemn. Bring the people to a\ndecision. Make them feel the vital force of truth. If any speak one\nword of flattery to you, rebuke them sharply. Tell them that Satan\nhas troubled you with that for some time, and they need not help\nhim in his work.\nWhen among the sisters, be reserved. No matter if they think you\nlack courtesy. If sisters, married or unmarried, show any familiarity,\nrepulse them. Be abrupt and decided, that they may ever understand\nthat you give no countenance to such weakness. When before the\nyoung, and at all times, be grave, be solemn. I saw that if Brother\nLoughborough and yourself make God your strength, a work will\nbe accomplished by you for His poor people, for two can be a host.\nCome close to each other, pray together and separately, be free with\neach other. Brother Hull should confide in Brother Loughborough\u2019s\njudgment, and listen to his counsel and advice.\nChapter 80\u2014Unconsecrated Ministers [438]\nMinisters who preach the third message should labor because\nthey feel that God has laid upon them the burden of the work. Our\nministers are placed above want, if they exercise any degree of\neconomy. If they lack, they will be in want in any position in which\nthey may be placed. Give them the most favorable chance and they\nwould spend all they receive. This has been the case with Elder Hull.\nSuch need an almost inexhaustible fund to draw from in order to be\nsatisfied.\nThose who fail to manage wisely in temporal matters, generally\nlack in spiritual things. They fail to build up the church. They\nmay possess natural talents and be called smart speakers, and yet\nlack moral worth. They may draw large congregations and raise\nconsiderable excitement; but when the fruit is sought for, there is\nvery little, if any, to be found. Such men frequently get above the\nwork and lose their love for the simplicity of the gospel. They are\nnot sanctified through the truths they preach. This has been the case\nwith Elder Hull. He has lacked that grace which establishes the soul\nand elevates and ennobles the character of the man. It is a good thing\nthat the heart be established with grace. This is the ground of our\nsteadfastness.\nIn places where Elder Hull has given a course of lectures, the\npeople have been pleased with his witticisms and his peculiar style\nof preaching, yet but few have embraced the truth as the result of\nhis labors; and even of these quite a proportion soon renounce the\nfaith. Many have been disappointed that there was so little fruit to be\nfound after his labor. I was shown the reason. Humility, simplicity,\npurity, and holiness of life were lacking. He has thought that his\nsmart labor was invaluable, and that the cause would hardly exist\nif he should be disconnected from it; but if he could have known\nthe anxiety which the real laborers in the cause, who have tried to [439]\nhelp him, have suffered on his account, he would not have had so\nhigh an estimate of his own labors. His course has been a continual\n415\n416 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nburden to the cause, and it would have prospered better without his\ninfluence. The anxiety of his brethren to save him from falling has\nled them to do too much for him in point of means. They have been\npleased with his preaching talent, and some have been so indiscreet\nas to extol him and show a decided preference for him above other\npreaching brethren whose influence would tell for the advancement\nof the cause anywhere. This has hurt him. He had not sufficient\nhumility or enough of the grace of God to stand against the flattery of\nhis brethren. May God help these brethren to feel over their mistake\nand never again to be guilty of injuring a young minister by flattery.\nAll who desire to draw away from God\u2019s remnant people in order\nto follow their own corrupt hearts would throw themselves willingly\ninto Satan\u2019s hands, and should have the privilege. There are others\namong us who are in danger. They have an exalted opinion of their\nown ability, while their influence in many respects has been but\nlittle better than that of Elder Hull. Unless they thoroughly reform,\nthe cause would be better off without them. Unsanctified ministers\ninjure the cause and are a heavy tax upon their brethren. They\nneed someone to follow after them to correct their mistakes and to\nstraighten up and strengthen those who have been weakened and\ntorn down through their influence. They are jealous of those who\nhave borne burdens in the work, those who would sacrifice even their\nlives if necessary to advance the cause of truth. They judge their\nbrethren to have no higher motives than they have had. Doing much\nfor ministers who are thus subject to Satan\u2019s temptations injures\nthem and is a waste of means. It gives them influence, and thus\nplaces them where they can wound their brethren and the cause of\nGod most deeply.\nI have been shown that the doubts expressed in regard to the[440]\ntruthfulness of our position and the inspiration of the word of God\nare not caused as many suppose them to be. These difficulties are\nnot so much with the Bible or with the evidences of our faith as with\ntheir own hearts. The requirements of God\u2019s word are too close for\ntheir unsanctified natures. \u201cThe carnal mind is enmity against God:\nfor it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\u201d If\nthe feelings of the natural heart are not restrained and brought into\nsubjection by the sanctifying influence of the grace of God received\nthrough the channel of faith, the thoughts of the heart are not pure\nUnconsecrated Ministers 417\nand holy. The conditions of salvation brought to view in the word\nof God are reasonable, plain, and positive, being nothing less than\nperfect conformity to the will of God and purity of heart and life. We\nmust crucify self with the lusts thereof. We must cleanse ourselves\nfrom all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the\nfear of God.\nIn almost every case where persons become unsettled in regard\nto the inspiration of the word of God, it is on account of their un-\nsanctified lives, which that word condemns. They will not receive\nits reproofs and threatenings because these reflect upon their wrong\ncourse of action. They do not love those who would convert and re-\nstrain them. Difficulties and doubts which perplex the vicious heart\nwill be cleared away before the one practicing the pure principles of\ntruth.\nMany possess talents which would accomplish much good if\nsanctified and used in the cause of Christ, or much harm if employed\nin the service of unbelief and Satan. The gratification of self and its\nvarious lusts will pervert the talents and make them a curse instead\nof a blessing. Satan, the archdeceiver, possesses wonderful talents.\nHe was once an exalted angel, next to Christ. He fell through self-\nexaltation, and created a rebellion in heaven, and caused many to\nfall with him. Then his talents and skill were employed against the [441]\ngovernment of God, to cause all whom he could control to despise\nthe authority of heaven. Those who are charmed with his Satanic\nmajesty may choose to imitate this fallen general and share with him\nhis fate at last.\nPurity of life imparts refinement, which will lead those possess-\ning it to shrink more and more from coarseness and indulgence in\nsin. Such will not be led away from the truth or be given up to\ndoubt the inspiration of the word of God. On the contrary, they will\nengage in the daily study of the sacred word with ever-increasing\ninterest, and the evidences of Christianity and inspiration will stamp\ntheir impress on the mind and life. Those who love sin will turn\naway from the Bible, will love to doubt, and will become reckless in\nprinciple. They will receive and advocate false theories. Such will\nascribe man\u2019s sins to his circumstances, and when he commits some\ngreat sin they make him a subject of pity instead of looking upon\nhim as a criminal to be punished. This will always suit a depraved\n418 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nheart, which in course of time will develop the principles of fallen\nnature. By some general process, men abolish sin at once to avoid\nthe unpleasant necessity of individual reformation and exertion. In\norder to free themselves from the obligation of present effort, many\nare ready to declare of no account all the labor and effort of their\nlives while following the sacred principles of God\u2019s word. Elder\nHull\u2019s philosophical necessity has its stronghold in the corruptions\nof the heart. God is raising up men to go forth to labor in the harvest\nfield, and if they are humble, devoted, and godly, they will take\nthe crowns which those ministers lose who concerning the faith are\nreprobate.\nNovember 5, 1862, I was shown that some men mistake their\ncalling. They think that if a man cannot labor with his hands, or\nif he is not a business character, he will make a minister. Many\nmake a great mistake here. A man who has no business tact may[442]\nmake a minister, but he will lack qualifications that every minister\nmust possess in order to deal wisely in the church and build up the\ncause. But when a minister is good in the pulpit, and, like Elder\nHull, fails in management, he should never go out alone. Another\nshould go with him to supply his lack and manage for him. And\nalthough it may be humiliating, he should give heed to the judgment\nand counsel of this companion, as a blind man follows one who has\nsight. By so doing he will escape many dangers that would prove\nfatal to him were he left alone.\nThe prosperity of the cause of God depends much upon the\nministers who labor in the gospel field. Those who teach the truth\nshould be devotional, self-sacrificing, godly men who understand\ntheir business and go about doing good because they know that God\nhas called them to the work, men who feel the worth of souls and will\nbear burdens and responsibilities. A thorough workman is known\nby the perfection of his work.\nThere are but few preachers among us. And because the cause\nof God seemed to need help so much, some have been led to think\nthat almost anyone claiming to be a minister would be acceptable.\nSome have thought that because persons could pray and exhort with\na degree of freedom in meeting, they were qualified to go forth as\nlaborers. And before they were proved, or could show any good fruit\nof their labors, men whom God has not sent have been encouraged\nUnconsecrated Ministers 419\nand flattered by some brethren lacking experience. But their work\nshows the character of the workman. They scatter and confuse, but\ndo not gather in and build up. A few may receive the truth as the\nfruit of their labors, but these generally rise no higher than those\nfrom whom they learned the truth. The same lack which marked\ntheir own course is seen in their converts.\nThe success of this cause does not depend upon our having a [443]\nlarge number of ministers, but it is of the highest importance that\nthose who do labor in connection with the cause of God should\nbe men who really feel the burden and sacredness of the work to\nwhich He has called them. A few self-sacrificing godly men, small\nin their own estimation, can do a greater amount of good than a\nmuch larger number if a part of these are unqualified for the work,\nyet self-confident and boastful of their own talents. A number of\nthese in the field, who would better fill some calling at home, would\nmake it necessary that nearly all the time of the faithful ministers\nbe spent in following after them to correct their wrong influence.\nThe future usefulness of young preachers depends much upon the\nmanner in which they enter upon their labors. Brethren who have\nthe cause of God at heart are so anxious to see the truth advance\nthat they are in danger of doing too much for ministers who have\nnot been proved, by helping them liberally to means and giving\nthem influence. Those who enter the gospel field should be left to\nearn themselves a reputation, even if it must be through trials and\nprivations. They should first give full proof of their ministry.\nBrethren of experience should be guarded; and instead of ex-\npecting these young preachers to help and lead them, should feel a\nresponsibility upon them to take charge of these young preachers,\nto instruct, advise, and lead them, to have a fatherly care for them.\nYoung ministers should have system, a firm purpose, and a mind to\nwork, that they may eat no man\u2019s bread for nought. They should\nnot go from place to place, and introduce some points of our faith\ncalculated to stir up prejudice, and leave before the evidences of\npresent truth are half presented. Young men who think that they\nhave a duty to do in connection with the work should not take the\nresponsibility of teaching the truth until they have availed themselves\nof the privilege of being under the influence of some experienced\npreacher who is systematic in his work; they should learn of him [444]\n420 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nas a pupil at school would learn of his teacher. They should not go\nhither and thither, with no definite object or matured plans to carry\nout in their labor.\nSome who have but little experience, and are least qualified to\nteach the truth, are the last to ask advice and counsel of their experi-\nenced brethren. They put on the minister, and place themselves on a\nlevel with those of long and tried experience, and are not satisfied\nunless they can lead, thinking that because they are ministers, they\nknow all that is worth knowing. Such preachers certainly lack a true\nknowledge of themselves. They do not possess becoming modesty\nand have altogether too high an opinion of their own abilities. Min-\nisters of experience, who realize the sacredness of the work, and\nfeel the weight of the cause upon them, are jealous of themselves.\nThey consider it a privilege to advise with their brethren and are not\noffended if improvements are suggested in their plans of labor or in\ntheir manner of speaking.\nThose ministers who have come out from the different denom-\ninations to embrace the third angel\u2019s message often wish to teach\nwhen they should be learners. Some have a great share of their for-\nmer teaching to unlearn before they can fully learn the principles of\npresent truth. Ministers will injure the cause of God by going forth\nto labor for others when there is as great a work to be done for them\nto fit them for their labors as they may wish to do for unbelievers.\nIf they are unqualified for the work, it will require the labor of two\nor three faithful ministers to follow after and correct their wrong\ninfluence. In the end it would be cheaper for the cause of God to\ngive such ministers a good support to remain at home and do no\ninjury in the field.\nPreachers have been regarded by some as especially inspired,\nas being only mediums for the Lord to speak through. If the aged\nand those of long experience see failings in a minister and suggest\nimprovements in his manners, in the tone of his voice, or in his[445]\ngestures, he has sometimes felt hurt, and has reasoned that God\ncalled him just as he was, that the power was of God and not of\nhimself, and that God must do the work for him, that he did not\npreach according to man\u2019s wisdom, etc. It is a mistake to think\nthat a man cannot preach unless he becomes wrought up to a high\ndegree of excitement. Men who are thus dependent upon feeling\nUnconsecrated Ministers 421\nmay be of use in exhortation when they feel just like it; but they will\nnever make good, burden-bearing laborers. When the work moves\nhard and everything assumes a discouraging aspect, the excitable\nand those dependent upon feeling are not prepared to bear their\nshare of the burdens. In times of discouragement and darkness how\nimportant to have calm-thinking men, who are not dependent on\ncircumstances, but who trust God and labor on in the darkness as\nwell as in the light. Men who serve God from principle, although\ntheir faith may be severely tried, will be seen leaning securely upon\nthe never-failing arm of Jehovah.\nYoung preachers, and men who have once been ministers, who\nhave been coarse and rough in their manners, making expressions\nin their conversation which were not perfectly modest and chaste,\nare not fit to engage in this work until they give evidence of an\nentire reform. One word spoken unadvisedly may do more harm\nthan a series of meetings held by them will do good. They leave\nthe standard of truth, which should be ever exalted, lowered to the\ndust before the community. Their converts generally come up no\nhigher than the standard raised for them by the ministers. Men who\nare standing between the living and the dead should be just right.\nThe minister should not be off his guard for a single moment. He\nis laboring to elevate others by bringing them up upon the platform\nof truth. Let him show to others that the truth has done something\nfor him. He should see the evil of these careless, rough, vulgar\nexpressions, and should put away and despise everything of this [446]\ncharacter. Unless he does this, his converts will pattern after him.\nAnd when faithful ministers shall follow after and labor with these\nconverts to correct their wrongs, they will excuse themselves by\nreferring to the minister. If you condemn his course, they will turn\nto you and ask: Why do you uphold and give influence to men\nby sending them out to preach to sinners while they are sinners\nthemselves?\nThe work in which we are engaged is a responsible and exalted\nwork. Those who minister in word and doctrine should themselves\nbe patterns of good works. They should be examples in holiness,\ncleanliness, and order. The appearance of the servant of God, out\nof the pulpit and in, should be that of a living preacher. He can\naccomplish far more by his godly example than by merely preaching\n422 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin the desk, while his influence out of the desk is not worthy of\nimitation. Those who labor in this cause are bearing to the world the\nmost elevated truth that was ever committed to mortals.\nMen who are chosen of God to labor in this cause will give\nproof of their high calling and will consider it their highest duty to\ngrow and improve until they shall become able workmen. Then, as\nthey manifest an earnestness to improve upon the talent which God\nhas entrusted to them, they should be helped judiciously. But the\nencouragement given them should not savor of flattery, for Satan\nhimself will do enough of that kind of work. Men who think that they\nhave a duty to preach should not be sustained in throwing themselves\nand their families at once upon the brethren for support. They are not\nentitled to this until they can show good fruits of their labor. There\nis now danger of injuring young preachers, and those who have but\nlittle experience, by flattery, and by relieving them of burdens in life.\nWhen not preaching they should be doing what they can for their\nown support. This is the best way to test the nature of their call to\npreach. If they desire to preach only that they may be supported as[447]\nministers, and the church pursue a judicious course, they will soon\nlose the burden and leave preaching for more profitable business.\nPaul, a most eloquent preacher, miraculously converted of God to\ndo a special work, was not above labor. He says: \u201cEven unto this\npresent hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are\nbuffeted, and have no certain dwelling place; and labor, working\nwith our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we\nsuffer it.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:11, 12. \u201cNeither did we eat any man\u2019s\nbread for nought; but wrought with labor and travail night and day,\nthat we might not be chargeable to any of you.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 3:8.\nI have been shown that many do not rightly estimate the talents\nwhich are among them. Some brethren do not understand what\npreaching talent would be the best for the advancement of the cause\nof truth, but think only of the present gratification of their feelings.\nWithout reflection they will show preference for a speaker who\nmanifests considerable zeal in his preaching and relates anecdotes\nwhich please the ear and animate the mind for a moment, but leave\nno lasting impression. At the same time they will put a low estimate\nupon a preacher who has prayerfully studied that he may present\nbefore the people the arguments of our position in a calm manner\nUnconsecrated Ministers 423\nand in a connected form. His labor is not appreciated, and he is often\ntreated with indifference.\nA man may preach in a spirited manner and please the ear, but\nconvey no new idea or real intelligence to the mind. The impres-\nsions received through such preaching last no longer than while\nthe speaker\u2019s voice is heard. When search is made for the fruit of\nsuch labor, there is little to be found. These flashy gifts are not as\nbeneficial, and well calculated to advance the cause of truth, as a gift\nthat can be trusted in hard, difficult places. In the work of teaching\nthe truth it is necessary that the important points of our position be\nwell fortified with Scripture evidences. Assertions may silence the [448]\nunbeliever, but will not convince him. Believers are not the only\nones for whose benefit laborers are sent into the field. The salvation\nof souls is the great object.\nSome brethren have erred in this respect. They have thought\nthat Brother C was the right man to labor in Vermont and that he\ncould accomplish more than any other minister in that state. Such\ndo not view matters from a right standpoint. Brother C can speak\nin a manner to interest a congregation, and if this were all that is\nnecessary to make a successful preacher, then a class of brethren\nand sisters would be right in their estimation of him. But he is not\na thorough workman; he is not reliable. In church trials he is of\nno account. He has not experience, judgment, and discernment to\nbe of any benefit to the church when in trial. He has not been a\nthoroughgoing man in temporal matters, and although he has but\na small family, he has needed assistance more or less. The same\nlack is manifested in spiritual things as in temporal affairs. Had\nthe right course been pursued toward him in the commencement\nof his preaching, he might now be of some use in this cause. His\nbrethren injured him by making too much of him and by leaving him\nto bear but few of the burdens of life, until he has thought that his\nlabors were of the greatest consequence. He has been willing that\nbrethren in Vermont should bear his burdens while he was relieved\nfrom care. He has not had a suitable amount of exercise to give tone\nand strength to his muscles, and for the good of his health.\nHe is not capable of building up churches. When he feels the woe\nupon him if he preach not the gospel, as self-sacrificing preachers\nhave felt it in the past, then like them he will be willing to labor\n424 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwith his hands a part of the time to earn means to support his family\nthat they may not be burdensome to the church, and then he will\ngo forth, not merely to preach, but to save souls. Efforts made with\nsuch a spirit will accomplish something. He has been exalted in his\nown estimation, has thought himself equal to any of the laborers[449]\nin Vermont, and has felt that he should be ranked with them and\nshould be consulted in business matters of the church, when he\nhas not earned a reputation nor proved himself worthy. What self-\nsacrifice or devotion has he manifested for the church? What perils or\nhardships has he endured, that the brethren can have their confidence\nestablished in him as a laborer whom they can trust, whose influence\nwill be good wherever he goes? Until he possesses an entirely\ndifferent spirit and acts from unselfish principles, he would better\ngive up the idea of preaching.\nBrethren in Vermont have overlooked the moral worth of men\nlike the Brethren Bourdeau, Pierce, and Stone, who have a depth of\nexperience and whose influence has been such as to gain the confi-\ndence of the community. Their industrious and consistent lives have\nmade them daily, living preachers, and their labors have removed\na great amount of prejudice and have gathered and built up. Yet\nbrethren have not appreciated the labor of these men, while they\nhave been pleased with that of some who will not bear to be tested\nand proved, and who can show but little fruit of their labor.\n* * * * *\nChapter 81\u2014The Minister\u2019s Wife\nJune 5, 1863, I was shown that Satan is ever at work to dishearten\nand lead astray ministers whom God has chosen to preach the truth.\nThe most effectual way in which he can work is through home\ninfluences, through unconsecrated companions. If he can control\ntheir minds, he can through them the more readily gain access to\nthe husband, who is laboring in word and doctrine to save souls. I\nwas referred to the warnings which God has repeatedly given, and\nto the duties which have been pointed out as belonging to the wife\nof a minister; yet these warnings have not had a lasting influence.\nThe testimonies given have had effect but a short time. The light [450]\nhas been but partially followed. Obedience and devotion to God\nhave been forgotten, many have disregarded the sacred obligation\nresting upon them to improve the light and privileges given, and\nwalk as children of the light. If the veil could be parted and all could\nsee just how their cases are regarded in heaven, there would be an\nawakening, and each would with fear inquire, What shall I do to be\nsaved?\nThe minister\u2019s wife who is not devoted to God is no help to her\nhusband. While he dwells upon the necessity of bearing the cross\nand urges the importance of self-denial, the daily example of his\nwife often contradicts his preaching and destroys its force. In this\nway she becomes a great hindrance and often leads her husband\naway from his duty and from God. She does not realize what a sin\nshe is committing. Instead of seeking to be useful, seeking with true\nlove for souls to help such as need help, she shrinks from the task\nand prefers a useless life. She is not constrained by the power of\nChrist\u2019s love and by unselfish, holy principles. She does not choose\nto do the will of God, to be a co-worker with her husband, with\nangels, and with God. When the wife of the minister accompanies\nher husband in his mission to save souls, it is a great sin for her\nto hinder him in his work by manifesting unhappy discontent. Yet\ninstead of entering heartily into his labors, seeking every opportunity\n425\n426 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto unite her interest and labor with his, she often studies how she can\nmake it more easy or pleasant for herself. If things around them are\nnot as agreeable as she could wish (as they will not always be), she\nshould not indulge homesick feelings, or by lack of cheerfulness and\nby spoken complaints harass the husband and make his task harder,\nand perhaps by her discontent draw him from the place where he\ncould do good. She should not divert the interest of her husband\nfrom laboring for the salvation of souls, to sympathize with her\nailments and gratify her whimsical, discontented feelings. If she[451]\nwould forget herself and labor to help others, talk and pray with poor\nsouls, and act as if their salvation was of higher importance than any\nother consideration, she would have no time to be homesick. She\nwould feel from day to day a sweet satisfaction as a reward for her\nunselfish labor; I cannot call it sacrifice, for some of our ministers\u2019\nwives do not know what it is to sacrifice or suffer for the truth\u2019s sake.\nIn former years the wives of ministers endured want and perse-\ncution. When their husbands suffered imprisonment, and sometimes\ndeath, those noble, self-sacrificing women suffered with them, and\ntheir reward will be equal to that bestowed on the husband. Mrs.\nBoardman and the Mrs. Judsons suffered for the truth, suffered with\ntheir companions. They sacrificed home and friends in every sense\nof the word to aid their companions in the work of enlightening\nthose who sat in darkness, to reveal to them the hidden mysteries of\nthe word of God. Their lives were in constant peril. To save souls\nwas their great object, and for this they could suffer cheerfully.\nI was shown the life of Christ. When His self-denial and sacrifice\nis compared with the trials and sufferings of the wives of some of\nour ministers, it causes anything which they may call sacrifice to\nsink into insignificance. If the minister\u2019s wife speaks words of\ndiscontent and discouragement, the influence upon the husband is\ndisheartening and tends to cripple him in his labor, especially if his\nsuccess depends upon surrounding influences. Must the minister\nof God in such cases be crippled or torn from his field of labor to\ngratify the feelings of his wife, which arise from an unwillingness\nto yield inclination to duty? The wife should conform her wishes\nand pleasures to duty, and give up her selfish feelings for the sake of\nChrist and the truth. Satan has had much to do with controlling the\nMinister\u2019s Wife 427\nlabors of the ministers through the influence of selfish, ease-loving\ncompanions.\nIf a minister\u2019s wife accompanies her husband in his travels, she [452]\nshould not go for her own special enjoyment, to visit, and to be\nwaited upon, but to labor with him. She should have a united interest\nwith him to do good. She should be willing to accompany her\nhusband, if home cares do not hinder, and she should aid him in\nhis efforts to save souls. With meekness and humility, yet with a\nnoble self-reliance, she should have a leading influence upon minds\naround her, and should act her part and bear her cross and burden\nin meeting, and around the family altar, and in conversation at the\nfireside. The people expect this, and they have a right to expect it. If\nthese expectations are not realized, the husband\u2019s influence is more\nthan half destroyed. The wife of a minister can do much if she will.\nIf she possesses the spirit of self-sacrifice and has a love for souls,\nshe can with him do almost an equal amount of good.\nA sister laborer in the cause of truth can understand and reach\nsome cases, especially among the sisters, that the minister cannot.\nA responsibility rests upon the minister\u2019s wife which she should not\nand cannot lightly throw off. God will require the talent lent her,\nwith usury. She should work earnestly, faithfully, and unitedly with\nher husband to save souls. She should never urge her wishes and\ndesires, or express a lack of interest in her husband\u2019s labor, or dwell\nupon homesick, discontented feelings. All these natural feelings\nmust be overcome. She should have a purpose in life which should\nbe unfalteringly carried out. What if this conflicts with the feelings,\nand pleasures, and natural tastes? These should be cheerfully and\nreadily sacrificed in order to do good and save souls.\nThe wives of ministers should live devoted, prayerful lives. But\nsome would enjoy a religion in which there are no crosses and\nwhich calls for no self-denial and exertion on their part. Instead of\nstanding nobly for themselves, leaning upon God for strength and\nbearing their individual responsibility, they have much of the time [453]\nbeen dependent upon others, deriving their spiritual life from them.\nIf they would only lean confidingly, in childlike trust, upon God,\nand have their affections centered in Jesus, deriving their life from\nChrist, the living Vine, what an amount of good they might do, what\na help they might be to others, what a support to their husbands, and\n428 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwhat a reward would be theirs in the end! \u201cWell done, good and\nfaithful servants,\u201d would fall like sweetest music upon their ears.\nThe words, \u201cEnter thou into the joy of thy Lord,\u201d would repay them\na thousand times for all suffering and trials endured to save precious\nsouls.\nThose who will not improve the talent which God has given them\nwill fail of everlasting life. Those who have been of but little use in\nthe world will be rewarded accordingly, as their works have been.\nWhen everything goes smoothly, they are borne along on the wave;\nbut when they need earnestly and untiringly to apply the oar, and row\nagainst wind and tide, there seems to be no energy in their Christian\ncharacter. They will not take the trouble to work, but lay down their\noars and contentedly let the current carry them downstream. Thus\nthey generally remain until someone takes the burden and labors\nearnestly and energetically to pull them upstream. Every time they\nyield to such indolence they lose strength and have less inclination\nto work in the cause of God. It is only the faithful conqueror who\nwins eternal glory.\nA minister\u2019s wife should ever have a leading influence on the\nminds of those with whom she associates, and she will be a help or a\ngreat hindrance. She either gathers with Christ or scatters abroad. A\nself-sacrificing missionary spirit is lacking among the companions\nof our ministers. It is self first, and then Christ secondly, and even\nthirdly. Never should a minister take his wife with him unless he\nknows that she can be a spiritual help, that she is one who can bear,\nand endure, and suffer, to do good, and to benefit souls for Christ\u2019s\nsake. Those who accompany their husbands should go to labor[454]\nunitedly with them. They must not expect to be free from trials\nand disappointments. They should not think too much of pleasant\nfeelings. What have feelings to do with duty?\nI was cited the case of Abraham. God said to him, \u201cTake now\nthy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into\nthe land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon\none of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\u201d Abraham obeyed\nGod. He did not consult his feelings, but with a noble faith and\nconfidence in God he prepared for his journey. With a heart rent\nwith anguish he beheld the proud and loving mother gazing with\nfond affection upon the son of promise. But he led that loved son\nMinister\u2019s Wife 429\naway. Abraham suffered, yet he did not let his will rise in rebellion\nagainst the will of God. Duty, stern duty, controlled him. He dared\nnot consult his feelings or yield to them for one moment. His only\nson walked by the side of the stern, loving, suffering father, talking\nengagedly, uttering over and over the fond name of father, and then\ninquiring: \u201cWhere is the sacrifice?\u201d Oh, what a test for the faithful\nfather! Angels looked with pleased wonder upon the scene. The\nfaithful servant of God even bound his beloved son and laid him\nupon the wood. The knife was raised, when an angel cried out:\n\u201cAbraham, Abraham.... Lay not thine hand upon the lad.\u201d\nI saw that it is no light thing to be a Christian. It is a small matter\nto profess the Christian name; but it is a great and sacred thing to live\na Christian life. There is but a little time now to secure the immortal\ncrown, to have a record of good acts and fulfilled duties recorded in\nheaven. Every tree is judged by its fruit. Everyone will be judged\naccording to his deeds, not his profession or his faith. The question\nwill never be asked, How much did he profess? but, What fruit did\nhe bear? If the tree is corrupt, the fruit is evil. If the tree is good, it\ncannot produce evil fruit.\nChapter 82\u2014Patent Rights[455]\nMany of our brethren involve themselves by engaging in new\nenterprises which look flattering; but in a short time they find them-\nselves disappointed and their means gone, which should have been\nused to support their families and advance the cause of present truth.\nThen come remorse, regret, and self-reproach; and some consci-\nentious ones cast away their confidence, and lose their spiritual\nenjoyment, and in consequence of mental distress their health also\nsuffers.\nThose who believe the truth should practice economy, live upon\nplain, wholesome food, always making it a rule to live within their\nmeans. Brethren should never engage in new enterprises without\nconsulting those of experience who are good managers in temporal\nand spiritual matters. By doing this they would save themselves\nmuch perplexity.\nBrethren would better be contented with a small income, and\nhandle that little prudently, rather than run risks to better their con-\ndition, and suffer continual losses thereby. Some Sabbathkeepers\nwho have engaged in the sale of patent rights, have traveled among\ntheir brethren to save expense, and have induced them to invest their\nmeans in patent rights. Such will not be clear before God until they\nhave made up the loss which these brethren have sustained.\n430\nNumber Eleven\u2014Testimony for the [456]\nChurch\nChapter 83\u2014Reform in Dress\n[See Appendix.]\nDear Brethren and Sisters,\nMy apology for calling your attention again to the subject of\ndress is that some do not seem to understand what I have before\nwritten; and an effort is made, perhaps by those who do not wish\nto believe what I have written, to make confusion in our churches\nupon this important subject. Many letters have been written to me,\nstating difficulties, which I have not had time to answer; and now, to\nanswer the many inquiries, I give the following statements, which it\nis hoped will forever put the subject at rest, so far as my testimonies\nare concerned.\nSome contend that what I wrote in Testimony for the Church\nNo. 10 does not agree with my testimony in the work entitled, How\nto Live. They were written from the same view, hence are not two\nviews, one contradicting the other, as some may imagine; if there is\nany difference, it is simply in the form of expression. In Testimony\nfor the Church No. 10 I stated as follows:\n\u201cNo occasion should be given to unbelievers to reproach our\nfaith. We are considered odd and singular, and should not take a\ncourse to lead unbelievers to think us more so than our faith requires\nus to be. Some who believe the truth may think that it would be\nmore healthful for the sisters to adopt the American costume, yet if[457]\nthat mode of dress would cripple our influence among unbelievers\nso that we could not so readily gain access to them, we should by no\nmeans adopt it, though we suffered much in consequence. But some\nare deceived in thinking there is so much benefit to be received from\nthis costume. While it may prove a benefit to some, it is an injury to\nothers.\n\u201cI saw that God\u2019s order has been reversed, and His special di-\nrections disregarded, by those who adopt the American costume. I\nwas referred to Deuteronomy 22:5: \u201cThe woman shall not wear that\n432\nReform in Dress 433\nwhich pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman\u2019s\ngarment: for all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God.\u2019\nGod would not have His people adopt the so-called reform dress. It is\nimmodest apparel, wholly unfitted for the modest, humble followers\nof Christ.\n\u201cThere is an increasing tendency to have women in their dress\nand appearance as near like the other sex as possible, and to fash-\nion their dress very much like that of men, but God pronounces it\nabomination. \u2018In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in\nmodest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety.\u2019 1 Timothy 2:9.\n\u201cThose who feel called out to join the movement in favor of\nwoman\u2019s rights and the so-called dress reform might as well sever all\nconnection with the third angel\u2019s message. The spirit which attends\nthe one cannot be in harmony with the other. The Scriptures are plain\nupon the relations and rights of men and women. Spiritualists have,\nto quite an extent, adopted this singular mode of dress. Seventh-day\nAdventists, who believe in the restoration of the gifts, are often\nbranded as spiritualists. Let them adopt this costume, and their\ninfluence is dead. The people would place them on a level with\nspiritualists and would refuse to listen to them.\n\u201cWith the so-called dress reform there goes a spirit of levity and\nboldness just in keeping with the dress. Modesty and reserve seem [458]\nto depart from many as they adopt that style of dress. I was shown\nthat God would have us take a course consistent and explainable.\nLet the sisters adopt the American costume and they would destroy\ntheir own influence and that of their husbands. They would become\na byword and a derision. Our Saviour says: \u2018Ye are the light of the\nworld.\u2019 \u2018Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your\ngood works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u2019 There is\na great work for us to do in the world, and God would not have us\ntake a course to lessen or destroy our influence with the world.\u201d\nThe foregoing was given me as a reproof to those who are in-\nclined to adopt a style of dress resembling that worn by men; but\nat the same time I was shown the evils of the common style of\nwoman\u2019s dress, and to correct these, also gave the following found\nin Testimony for the Church, No. 10:\n\u201cWe do not think it in accordance with our faith to dress in the\nAmerican costume, to wear hoops, or to go to an extreme in wearing\n434 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nlong dresses which sweep the sidewalks and streets. If women would\nwear their dresses so as to clear the filth of the streets an inch or\ntwo, their dresses would be modest, and they could be kept clean\nmuch more easily, and would wear longer. Such a dress would be in\naccordance with our faith.\u201d\nI will now give an extract from what I have elsewhere said upon\nthis subject:\n\u201cChristians should not take pains to make themselves a gazing-\nstock by dressing differently from the world. But if, when following\nout their convictions of duty in respect to dressing modestly and\nhealthfully, they find themselves out of fashion, they should not\nchange their dress in order to be like the world; but they should\nmanifest a noble independence and moral courage to be right, if\nall the world differ from them. If the world introduce a modest,\nconvenient, and healthful mode of dress, which is in accordance\nwith the Bible, it will not change our relation to God or to the world[459]\nto adopt such a style of dress. Christians should follow Christ and\nmake their dress conform to God\u2019s word. They should shun extremes.\nThey should humbly pursue a straightforward course, irrespective\nof applause or of censure, and should cling to the right because of\nits own merits.\n\u201cWomen should clothe their limbs with regard to health and com-\nfort. Their feet and limbs need to be clad as warmly as men\u2019s. The\nlength of the fashionable dress is objectionable for several reasons:\n\u201c1. It is extravagant and unnecessary to have the dress of such a\nlength that it will sweep the sidewalk and street.\n\u201c2. A dress thus long gathers dew from the grass, and mud from\nthe streets, and is therefore unclean.\n\u201c3. In its bedraggled condition it comes in contact with the\nsensitive ankles, which are not sufficiently protected, quickly chilling\nthem, and thus endangering health and life. This is one of the greatest\ncauses of catarrh and of scrofulous swellings.\n\u201c4. The unnecessary length is an additional weight upon the hips\nand bowels.\n\u201c5. It hinders the walking, and is also often in other people\u2019s\nway.\n\u201cThere is still another style of dress which is adopted by a class\nof so-called dress reformers. They imitate the opposite sex as nearly\nReform in Dress 435\nas possible. They wear the cap, pants, vest, coat, and boots, the last\nof which is the most sensible part of the costume. Those who adopt\nand advocate this style of dress carry the so-called dress reform to\nvery objectionable lengths. Confusion will be the result. Some who\nadopt this costume may be correct in their general views upon the\nhealth question, but they would be instrumental in accomplishing\nvastly more good if they did not carry the matter of dress to such\nextremes.\n\u201cIn this style of dress God\u2019s order has been reversed and His\nspecial directions disregarded. Deuteronomy 22:5: \u201cThe woman [460]\nshall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a\nman put on a woman\u2019s garment: for all that do so are abomination\nunto the Lord thy God.\u2019 God would not have His people adopt this\nstyle of dress. It is not modest apparel, and is not at all fitting\nfor modest, humble women who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers.\nGod\u2019s prohibitions are lightly regarded by all who advocate doing\naway with the distinction of dress between males and females. The\nextreme position taken by some dress reformers upon this subject\ncripples their influence.\n\u201cGod designed that there should be a plain distinction between\nthe dress of men and women, and has considered the matter of\nsufficient importance to give explicit directions in regard to it; for\nthe same dress worn by both sexes would cause confusion and great\nincrease of crime. Were the apostle Paul alive, and should he behold\nwomen professing godliness with this style of dress, he would utter\na rebuke. \u2018In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in\nmodest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided\nhair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women\nprofessing godliness) with good works.\u2019 The mass of professed\nChristians utterly disregard the teachings of the apostles, and wear\ngold, pearls, and costly array.\n\u201cGod\u2019s loyal people are the light of the world and the salt of\nthe earth, and they should ever remember that their influence is of\nvalue. Were they to exchange the extreme long dress for the extreme\nshort one, they would, to a great extent, destroy their influence.\nUnbelievers, whom it is their duty to benefit and seek to bring to\nthe Lamb of God, would be disgusted. Many improvements can be\n436 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmade in the dress of women in reference to health without making\nso great a change as to disgust the beholder.\n\u201cThe form should not be compressed in the least with corsets and\nwhalebones. The dress should be perfectly easy that the lungs and\nheart may have healthy action. The dress should reach somewhat[461]\nbelow the top of the boot, but should be short enough to clear the\nfilth of the sidewalk and street without being raised by the hand.\nA still shorter dress than this would be proper, convenient, and\nhealthful for women when doing their housework, and especially\nfor those who are obliged to perform more or less out-of-door labor.\nWith this style of dress, one light skirt, or two at most, is all that is\nnecessary, and this should be buttoned on to a waist, or suspended\nby straps. The hips were not formed to bear heavy weights. The\nheavy skirts worn by some, and allowed to drag down upon the hips,\nhave been the cause of various diseases which are not easily cured.\nThe sufferers seem to be ignorant of the cause of their sufferings,\nand continue to violate the laws of their being by girding their waists\nand wearing heavy skirts, until they are made lifelong invalids.\nWhen told of their mistake, many will immediately exclaim, \u2018Why,\nsuch a style of dress would be old-fashioned!\u2019 What if it is? I\nwish we could be old-fashioned in many respects. If we could\nhave the old-fashioned strength that characterized the old-fashioned\nwomen of past generations, it would be very desirable. I do not\nspeak unadvisedly when I say that the way in which women clothe\nthemselves, together with their indulgence of appetite, is the greatest\ncause of their present feeble, diseased condition. There is but one\nwoman in a thousand who clothes her limbs as she should. Whatever\nmay be the length of the dress, their limbs should be clothed as\nthoroughly as are the men\u2019s. This may be done by wearing lined\npants, gathered into a band and fastened about the ankle, or made\nfull and tapering at the bottom; and these should come down long\nenough to meet the shoe. The limbs and ankles thus clothed are\nprotected against a current of air. If the feet and limbs are kept\ncomfortable with warm clothing, the circulation will be equalized,\nand the blood will remain pure and healthy because it is not chilled\nor hindered in its natural passage through the system.\u201d\nThe principal difficulty in the minds of many is in regard to[462]\nthe length of the dress. Some insist that \u201cthe top of the boot,\u201d has\nReform in Dress 437\nreference to the top of such boots as are usually worn by men, which\nreach nearly to the knee. If it were the custom of women to wear\nsuch boots, then these persons should not be blamed for professing\nto understand the matter as they have; but as women generally do\nnot wear such boots, these persons have no right to understand me\nas they have pretended.\nIn order to show what I did mean, and that there is a harmony in\nmy testimonies on this subject, I will here give an extract from my\nmanuscripts written about two years ago:\n\u201cSince the article on dress appeared in How to Live, there has\nbeen with some a misunderstanding of the idea I wished to convey.\nThey have taken the extreme meaning of that which I have written\nin regard to the length of the dress, and have evidently had a very\nhard time over the matter. With their distorted views of the matter\nthey have discussed the question of shortening the dress until their\nspiritual vision has become so confused that they can only see men\nas trees walking. They have thought they could see a contradiction\nin my article on dress, recently published in How to Live, and that\narticle on the same subject contained in Testimony for the Church,\nNo. 10. I must contend that I am the best judge of the things which\nhave been presented before me in vision; and none need fear that I\nshall by my life contradict my own testimony, or that I shall fail to\nnotice any real contradiction in the views given me.\n\u201cIn my article on dress in How to Live I tried to present a health-\nful, convenient, economical, yet modest and becoming style of dress\nfor Christian women to wear, if they should choose so to do. I tried,\nperhaps imperfectly, to describe such a dress. \u2018The dress should\nreach somewhat below the top of the boot, but should be short enough\nto clear the filth of the sidewalk and street, without being raised by\nthe hand.\u2019 Some have contended that by the top of the boot, I meant [463]\nthe top of such boots as men usually wear. But by \u2018the top of the\nboot,\u2019 I designed to be understood the top of a boot, or gaiter shoe,\nusually worn by women. Had I thought I should be misunderstood, I\nwould have written more definitely. If it were the custom for women\nto wear high-topped boots like men, I could see sufficient excuse\nfor this misunderstanding. I think the language is very plain as it\nnow reads, and no one needs to be thrown into confusion. Please\nread again: \u2018The dress should reach somewhat below the top of the\n438 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nboot.\u2019 Now look at the qualification: \u2018But should be short enough to\nclear the filth of the sidewalk and street, without being raised by the\nhand. A still shorter dress than this would be proper, convenient, and\nhealthful for women when doing their housework, and especially for\nthose who are obliged to perform more or less out-of-door labor.\u2019\n\u201cI can see no excuse for reasonable persons misunderstanding\nand perverting my meaning. In speaking of the length of the dress,\nhad I referred to high-topped boots reaching nearly to the knee, why\nshould I have added, \u2018but [the dress] should be short enough to clear\nthe filth of the sidewalk and street, without being raised by the hand\u2019?\nIf high-topped boots were meant, the dress would most certainly be\nshort enough to keep clear of the filth of the street without being\nraised, and would be sufficiently short for all working purposes.\nReports have been circulated that \u2018Sister White wears the American\ncostume,\u2019 and that this style of dress is generally adopted and worn\nby the sisters in Battle Creek. I am here reminded of the saying that\n\u2018a lie will go around the world while truth is putting on his boots.\u2019\nOne sister gravely told me that she had received the idea that the\nAmerican costume was to be adopted by the Sabbathkeeping sisters,\nand that if such a style of dress should be enforced, she would not\nsubmit to it, for she never could bring her mind to wear such a dress.\n\u201cIn regard to my wearing the short dress, I would say, I have but[464]\none short dress, which is not more than a finger\u2019s length shorter than\nthe dresses I usually wear. I have worn this short dress occasionally.\nIn the winter I rose early, and putting on my short dress, which did\nnot require to be raised by my hands to keep it from draggling in the\nsnow, I walked briskly from one to two miles before breakfast. I have\nworn it several times to the office, when obliged to walk through\nlight snow, or when it was very wet or muddy. Four or five sisters of\nthe Battle Creek church have prepared for themselves a short dress\nto wear while doing their washing and house cleaning. A short dress\nhas not been worn in the streets of the city of Battle Creek, and has\nnever been worn to meeting. My views were calculated to correct\nthe present fashion, the extreme long dress, trailing upon the ground,\nand also to correct the extreme short dress, reaching about to the\nknees, which is worn by a certain class. I was shown that we should\nshun both extremes. By wearing the dress reaching about to the top\nof a woman\u2019s gaiter boot we shall escape the evils of the extreme\nReform in Dress 439\nlong dress, and shall also shun the evils and notoriety of the extreme\nshort dress.\n\u201cI would advise those who prepare for themselves a short dress\nfor working purposes to manifest taste and neatness in getting it\nup. Have it arranged in order, to fit the form nicely. Even if it is a\nworking dress, it should be made becoming, and should be cut after\na pattern. Sisters when about their work should not put on clothing\nwhich would make them look like images to frighten the crows from\nthe corn. It is more gratifying to their husbands and children to\nsee them in a becoming, well-fitting attire than it can be to mere\nvisitors or strangers. Some wives and mothers seem to think it is no\nmatter how they look when about their work and when they are seen\nonly by their husbands and children, but they are very particular to\ndress in taste for the eyes of those who have no special claims upon [465]\nthem. Is not the esteem and love of husband and children more to\nbe prized than that of strangers or common friends? The happiness\nof husband and children should be more sacred to every wife and\nmother than that of all others. Christian sisters should not at any time\ndress extravagantly, but should at all times dress as neatly, modestly,\nand healthfully as their work will allow.\u201d\nThe above-described dress we believe to be worthy of the name\nof the reform short dress. It is being adopted at the Western Health\nReform Institute and by some of the sisters at Battle Creek and other\nplaces where the matter is properly set before the people. In wide\ncontrast with this modest dress is the so-called American costume,\nresembling very nearly the dress worn by men. It consists of a vest,\npants, and a dress resembling a coat and reaching about halfway\nfrom the hip to the knee. This dress I have opposed, from what\nhas been shown me as in harmony with the word of God; while the\nother I have recommended as modest, comfortable, convenient, and\nhealthful.\nAnother reason which I offer as an apology for calling attention\nagain to the subject of dress is that not one in twenty of the sisters\nwho profess to believe the Testimonies has taken the first step in the\ndress reform. It may be said that Sister White generally wears her\ndresses in public longer than the dress she recommends to others.\nTo this I reply, When I visit a place to speak to the people where the\nsubject is new and prejudice exists, I think it best to be careful and\n440 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nnot close the ears of the people by wearing a dress which would be\nobjectionable to them. But after bringing the subject before them\nand fully explaining my position, I then appear before them in the\nreform dress, illustrative of my teachings.\nAs to the matter of wearing hoops, the reform in dress is entirely\nin advance of them. It cannot use them. And it is altogether too late\nto talk about wearing hoops, large or small. My position upon that[466]\nquestion is precisely what it ever has been, and I hope not to be held\nresponsible for what others may say on this subject, or for the course\npursued by those who put on hoops. I protest against the perversion\nof my private conversations on this subject, and ask that what I have\nwritten and published be regarded as my settled position.\n* * * * *\nChapter 84\u2014Our Ministers\nIn the vision given me in Rochester, New York, December 25,\n1865, I was shown that a most solemn work is before us. Its impor-\ntance and magnitude are not realized. As I marked the indifference\nwhich was everywhere apparent, I was alarmed for ministers and\npeople. There seemed to be a paralysis upon the cause of present\ntruth. The work of God seemed stayed. Ministers and people are un-\nprepared for the time in which they live, and nearly all who profess\nto believe present truth are unprepared to understand the work of\npreparation for this time. In their present state of worldly ambition,\nwith their lack of consecration to God, their devotion to self, they\nare wholly unfitted to receive the latter rain and, having done all,\nto stand against the wrath of Satan, who by his inventions would\ncause them to make shipwreck of faith, fastening upon them some\npleasing self-deception. They think they are all right when they are\nall wrong.\nMinisters and people must make greater advancement in the\nwork of reform. They should commence without delay to correct\ntheir wrong habits of eating, drinking, dressing, and working. I\nsaw that quite a number of the ministers are not awake upon this\nimportant subject. They are not all where God would have them.\nThe result is, some can show but little fruit of their labors. Ministers\nshould be ensamples to the flock of God. But they are not safe from\nSatan\u2019s temptations. They are the very ones whom he will seek to\nensnare. If he can succeed in lulling one minister to carnal security, [467]\nand by so doing divert his mind from the work, or deceive him with\nregard to his own true condition before God, he has accomplished\nmuch.\nI saw that the cause of God was not progressing as it might and\nas it should. Ministers fail to take hold of the work with that energy,\ndevotion, and decided perseverance which the importance of the\nwork demands. They have a vigilant adversary to contend with\nwhose diligence and perseverance are untiring. The feeble effort\n441\n442 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof ministers and people can bear no comparison with those of their\nadversary, the devil. On one side are the ministers who battle for\nthe right and have the help of God and holy angels. They should\nbe strong and valiant, and wholly devoted to the cause in which\nthey are engaged, having no separate interest. They should not be\nentangled with the things of this life, that they may please Him who\nhath chosen them to be soldiers.\nOn the other side are Satan and his angels, with all his agents on\nearth, who make every effort and use every device to advance error\nand wrong, and to cover up their hideousness and deformity with a\npleasing garb. Selfishness, hypocrisy, and every species of deception,\nSatan clothes with a garment of apparent truth and righteousness,\nand triumphs in his success, even with ministers and people who\nprofess to understand his wiles. The greater distance they keep from\nChrist their great Leader, the less they are like Him in character, the\nmore close is their resemblance in life and character to the servants\nof their great adversary, and the more sure is he of them at last.\nWhile they profess to be servants of Christ, they are servants of\nsin. Some ministers have their minds too much on the wages they\nreceive. They labor for wages and lose sight of the sacredness and\nimportance of the work.\nSome become slack and negligent in their labor; they pass over\nthe ground, but are weak and unsuccessful in their efforts. Their[468]\nhearts are not in the work. The theory of truth is clear. Many of them\nhad no part in searching out this truth by hard study and earnest\nprayer, and they know nothing of its preciousness and value by\nbeing compelled to sustain their positions against the opposition of\nits enemies. They do not see the necessity of preserving a spirit of\nentire consecration to the work. Their interest is divided between\nthemselves and the work.\nI saw that before the work of God can make any decided progress,\nthe ministers must be converted. When converted they will place\nless estimate upon wages and far more value upon the important,\nsacred, solemn work which they have accepted at the hand of God\nto perform, and which He requires them to do faithfully and well,\nas those who must render to Him a strict account. A faithful record\nof all their works is daily made by the recording angels. All their\nacts, and even the intents and purposes of the heart, stand faithfully\nOur Ministers 443\nrevealed. Nothing is hid from the all-seeing eye of Him with whom\nwe have to do. Those who have thrown all their energies into the\ncause of God, and who have ventured out and invested something,\nwill feel that the work of God is a part of them, and will not labor\nmerely for wages. They will not be eyeservants and seek to please\nthemselves, but will consecrate themselves and all their interests to\nthis solemn work.\nSome in their public labors with the churches are in danger of\nmaking mistakes from a lack of thoroughness. It is for their own\ninterest and that of the cause that they should search closely, try their\nmotives, and be certain to divest themselves of selfishness. They\nshould watch lest, while they preach straight truths to others, they fail\nto live by the same rule, and allow Satan to substitute something else\nfor the deep heartwork. They should be thorough with themselves\nand with the cause of God lest they work for wages and lose sight of\nthe important and exalted character of the work. They should not let\nself rule instead of Jesus, and they should be careful not to say to the [469]\nsinner in Zion, It shall be well with thee, when God has pronounced\na curse upon him.\nMinisters must arouse and manifest a life, zeal, and devotion\nto which they have for quite a length of time been almost strangers\nbecause they have failed to walk with God. The cause of God in\nmany places is not improving. Soul work is needed. The people are\novercharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this\nlife. They are entering deeper and deeper into a spirit of worldly\nenterprise. They are ambitious to get gain. Spirituality and devotion\nare rare. The spirit that prevails is to work, to accumulate, and to\nadd to that which they already possess. \u201cWhat will be the end of\nthese things?\u201d was the burden of my inquiry.\nConference meetings have accomplished no lasting good. Those\nwho attend the meetings carry a spirit of traffic with them. Ministers\nand people frequently bring their merchandise to these large gather-\nings, and the truths spoken from the desk fail to impress the heart.\nThe sword of the Spirit, the word of God, fails to do its office work;\nit falls tamely upon the hearers. The exalted work of God is made to\nconnect too closely with common things.\nThe ministers must be converted before they can strengthen their\nbrethren. They should not preach themselves, but Christ and His\n444 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nrighteousness. A reformation is needed among the people, but it\nshould first begin its purifying work with the ministers. They are\nwatchmen upon the walls of Zion, to sound the note of warning to the\ncareless, the unsuspecting; also to portray the fate of the hypocrite in\nZion. It seemed to me that some of the ministers had forgotten that\nSatan was yet alive, as persevering, earnest, and artful as ever; that\nhe was still seeking to allure souls from the path of righteousness.\nOne important part of the work of the ministry is to faithfully\npresent to the people the health reform as it stands connected with\nthe third angel\u2019s message as part and parcel of the same work. They[470]\nshould not fail to adopt it themselves, and should urge it upon all\nwho profess to believe the truth.\nMinisters should have no separate interest aside from the great\nwork of leading souls to the truth. Their energies are all needed\nhere. They should not engage in merchandise, in peddling, or in any\nbusiness aside from this one great work. The solemn charge given\nto Timothy rests with equal weight upon them, laying upon them the\nmost solemn obligations and most fearful responsibilities. \u201cI charge\nthee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall\njudge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom;\nPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke,\nexhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.\u201d \u201cBut watch thou in all\nthings, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full\nproof of thy ministry.\u201d\nWrong habits of life have lessened our mental and physical sen-\nsibilities, and all the strength we can acquire by right living and\nplacing ourselves in the best relation to health and life should be\ndevoted unreservedly to the work which God has assigned us. We\ncannot afford to use the few enfeebled, crippled energies which we\npossess to serve tables or to mingle merchandise with the work God\nhas committed to us. Every faculty of mind and body is now needed.\nThe work of God requires this, and no separate business can be en-\ngaged in aside from this great work without taking time and strength\nof mind and body, and thus lessening the vigor and force of our labor\nin the cause of God. Ministers who do this will not have all that time\nfor meditation and prayer, and all that strength and clearness of mind\nthat they should have to understand the cases of those who need help,\nand to be prepared to \u201cbe instant in season, out of season.\u201d A word\nOur Ministers 445\nfitly spoken at the right time may save some poor, erring, doubting,\nfainting soul. Paul exhorted Timothy: \u201cMeditate upon these things;\ngive thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.\u201d [471]\nIn Christ\u2019s commission to His disciples He tells them: \u201cWhatso-\never ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever\nye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d If this is the fear-\nfully responsible work of God\u2019s ministers, how important that they\ngive themselves wholly to it and watch for souls as they that must\ngive an account. Should any separate or selfish interest come in here\nand divide the heart from the work? Some ministers linger about\ntheir homes, and run out on the Sabbath, and then return and exhaust\ntheir energies in farming or in attending to home matters. They labor\nfor themselves through the week, and then spend the remnant of\ntheir exhausted energies in laboring for God. But such feeble efforts\nare not acceptable to Him. They have no mental or physical strength\nto spare. At best their efforts are feeble enough. But after they have\nbeen engrossed and entangled all through the laboring days of the\nweek with the cares and perplexities of this life, they are wholly\nunfitted for the high, the sacred, the important work of God. The\ndestiny of souls hangs upon the course they pursue and the decisions\nthey make. How important then that they should be temperate in all\nthings, not only in their eating, but in their labor, that their strength\nmay be unabated and devoted to their sacred calling.\nA great mistake has been made by some who profess present\ntruth, by introducing merchandise in the course of a series of meet-\nings and by their traffic diverting minds from the object of the meet-\nings. If Christ were now upon earth, He would drive out these\npeddlers and traffickers, whether they be ministers or people, with\na scourge of small cords, as when He entered the temple anciently\n\u201cand cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and over-\nthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that\nsold doves, and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be [472]\ncalled the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.\u201d\nThese traffickers might have pleaded as an excuse that the articles\nthey held for sale were for sacrificial offerings. But their object was\nto get gain, to obtain means, to accumulate.\nI was shown that if the moral and intellectual faculties had not\nbeen clouded by wrong habits of living, ministers and people would\n446 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhave been quick to discern the evil results of mixing sacred and\ncommon things. Ministers have stood in the desk and preached a\nmost solemn discourse, and then by introducing merchandise, and\nacting the part of a salesman, even in the house of God, they have\ndiverted the minds of their hearers from the impressions received,\nand destroyed the fruit of their labor. If the sensibilities had not been\nblunted, they would have had discernment to know that they were\nbringing sacred things down upon a level with common. The burden\nof selling our publications should not rest upon ministers who labor\nin word and doctrine. Their time and strength should be held in\nreserve, that their efforts may be thorough in a series of meetings.\nTheir time and strength should not be drawn upon to sell our books\nwhen they can be properly brought before the public by those who\nhave not the burden of preaching the word. In entering new fields it\nmay be necessary for the minister to take publications with him to\noffer for sale to the people, and it may be necessary in some other\ncircumstances also to sell books and transact business for the office\nof publication. But such work should be avoided whenever it can be\ndone by others.\nMinisters have all that they ought to do to preach the word, and\nafter they have urged solemn truth upon the people they should\nmaintain a humble dignity as the preachers of exalted truth and\nas representatives of the truth presented to the people. After their\nlabored effort they need rest. Even selling books upon present truth\nis a care, a tax to the mind, and a weariness to the body. If there are[473]\nthose who still have a reserve force and can be taxed without injury\nto themselves, there is important work for them to do, and it has but\njust commenced when they have spoken the truth to the people. Then\ncome the exemplary preaching, the watchful care, the seeking to do\ngood to others, the conversation, and visiting at the fireside from\nhouse to house, entering into the condition of mind and the spiritual\nstate of those who listened to the discourse from their lips; exhorting\nthis one, reproving that one, rebuking another, and comforting the\nafflicted, suffering, and desponding. The mind should be as free\nfrom weariness as possible that they may be minutemen, \u201cinstant\nin season, out of season.\u201d They should obey the injunction given by\nPaul to Timothy: \u201cMeditate upon these things; give thyself wholly\nto them.\u201d\nOur Ministers 447\nThe responsibility of the work rests very lightly upon some.\nThey feel that after they leave the desk their work is done. It is\na burden to visit, a burden to talk; and the people who are really\ndesirous of getting all the good there is for them, and who wish to\nhear and learn that they may see all things clearly, are not benefited\nand satisfied. Ministers excuse themselves because they are weary,\nand yet some exhaust their precious strength and spend their time\nin work which another could do just as well as they. They should\npreserve moral and physical vigor that as faithful workmen of God\nthey may give full proof of their ministry.\nIn every important place there should be a depository for pub-\nlications. And someone who really appreciates the truth should\nmanifest an interest to get these books into the hands of all who\nwill read. The harvest is great, but the laborers are few, and the\nfew experienced laborers now in the field have all they should do to\nlabor in word and doctrine. Men will arise who claim that God has\nlaid upon them the burden of teaching the truth to others. All such\nshould be proved and tried. They should not be relieved from all [474]\ncare, neither should they be lifted into responsible positions at once;\nbut they should be encouraged if they deserve encouragement, to\ngive full proof of their ministry. It would not be the best course for\nsuch ones to pursue, to enter into other men\u2019s labors. Let them first\nlabor in connection with one of experience and wisdom, and he can\nsoon see whether they are capable of exerting an influence that will\nbe saving. Young preachers who have never had wearing labor, nor\nfelt the draft upon their mental and physical strength, should not be\nencouraged to hope for a support independent of their own physical\nlabor, for this will only injure them and will be a bait to entice men\nto engage in the work who realize nothing of the burden of it or the\nresponsibility resting upon God\u2019s chosen ministers. Such will feel\ncompetent to teach others when they have scarcely learned the first\nprinciples themselves.\nMany who profess the truth are not sanctified by it and are not\nendowed with wisdom; they are not led and taught of God. God\u2019s\npeople, as a general thing, are worldly-minded and have departed\nfrom the simplicity of the gospel. This is the cause of the great\nlack of spiritual discernment in the course they have pursued toward\nministers. If a minister preaches with freedom, some will praise\n448 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nhim to his face. Instead of dwelling upon the truths he uttered, and\nimproving upon them, thus showing themselves to be not forgetful\nhearers, but doers of the work, they exalt him by referring to what\nhe has done. They dwell upon the virtues of the poor instrument, but\nforget Christ who employed the instrument. Ever since the fall of\nSatan, who was once an exalted angel in glory, ministers have fallen\nthrough exaltation. Unwise Sabbathkeepers have pleased the devil\nwell by praising their ministers. Were they aware that they were\naiding Satan in his work? They would have been alarmed had they\nrealized what they were doing. They were blinded, they were not\nstanding in the counsel of God. I lift my voice of warning against[475]\npraising or flattering the ministers. I have seen the evil, the dreadful\nevil, of this. Never, never speak a word in praise of ministers to\ntheir faces. Exalt God. Ever respect a faithful minister, realize his\nburdens and lighten them if you can; but do not flatter him, for Satan\nstands ready at his watchtower to do that kind of work himself.\nMinisters should not use flattery or be respecters of persons.\nThere ever has been, and still is, great danger of erring here, of\nmaking a little difference with the wealthy, or flattering them by\nspecial attention, if not by words. There is danger of \u201chaving men\u2019s\npersons in admiration\u201d for the sake of gain, but in doing this their\neternal interests are endangered. The minister may be the special\nfavorite of some wealthy man, and he may be very liberal with him;\nthis gratifies the minister, and he in turn lavishes praise upon the\nbenevolence of his donor. His name may be exalted by appearing\nin print, and yet that liberal donor may be entirely unworthy of the\ncredit given him. His liberality did not arise from a deep, living\nprinciple to do good with his means, to advance the cause of God\nbecause he appreciated it, but from some selfish motive, a desire\nto be thought liberal. He may have given from impulse and his\nliberality have no depth of principle. He may have been moved upon\nby listening to stirring truth which for the time being loosed his purse\nstrings; yet, after all, his liberality has no deeper motive. He gives by\nspasms; his purse opens spasmodically and closes just as securely\nspasmodically. He deserves no commendation, for he is in every\nsense of the word a stingy man, and unless thoroughly converted,\npurse and all, will hear the withering denunciation: \u201cGo to now, ye\nrich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.\nOur Ministers 449\nYour riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.\u201d Such\nwill awake at last from a horrible self-deception. Those who praised\ntheir spasmodic liberalities helped Satan to deceive them and make [476]\nthem think that they were very liberal, very sacrificing, when they\nknew not the first principles of liberality or self-sacrifice.\nSome men and women make themselves believe that they do\nnot consider the things of this world of much value, but prize the\ntruth and its advancement higher than any worldly gain. Many will\nawake at last to find that they have been deceived. They may have\nonce appreciated the truth, and earthly treasures in comparison with\ntruth may have appeared to them valueless; but after a time, as their\nworldly treasure increased, they became less devotional. Although\nthey have enough for a comfortable sustenance, yet all their acts\nshow that they are in nowise satisfied. Their works testify that their\nhearts are bound up in their earthly treasure. Gain, gain, is their\nwatchword. To this end every member of the family participates in\ntheir labor. They give themselves scarcely any time for devotion\nor for prayer. They work early and late. Sickly, diseased women\nand feeble children whip up their flagging ambition and use up the\nvitality and strength they have to reach an object, to gain a little,\nmake a little more money. They flatter themselves that they are\ndoing this that they may help the cause of God. Terrible deception!\nSatan looks on and laughs for he knows that they are selling soul and\nbody through their lust for gain. They are continually making flimsy\nexcuses for thus selling themselves for gain. They are blinded by\nthe god of this world. Christ has bought them by His own blood; but\nthey rob Christ, rob God, tear themselves to pieces, and are almost\nuseless in society.\nThey devote but little time to the improvement of the mind, and\nbut little time to social or domestic enjoyment. They are of but little\nbenefit to anyone. Their lives are a terrible mistake. Those who\nthus abuse themselves feel that their course of unremitting labor is\npraiseworthy. They are destroying themselves by their presumptuous\nlabor. They are marring the temple of God by continually violating [477]\nthe laws of their being through excessive labor, and yet they think\nit a virtue. When God calls them to account, when He requires of\nthem the talents He has lent them, with usury, what can they say?\nWhat excuse can they make? Were they heathen who know nothing\n450 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof the living God, and in their blind idolatrous zeal throw themselves\nunder the car of Juggernaut, their cases would be more tolerable.\nBut they had the light, they had warning upon warning to preserve\ntheir bodies, which God calls His temple, in as healthy a condition\nas possible that they might glorify Him in their bodies and spirits,\nwhich are His. The teachings of Christ they disregarded: \u201cLay not\nup for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth\ncorrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: but lay up for\nyourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth\ncorrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. For where\nyour treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d They let worldly cares\nentangle them. \u201cBut they that will be rich fall into temptation and a\nsnare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in\ndestruction and perdition.\u201d They worship their earthly treasure, as\nthe ignorant heathen does his idols.\nMany flatter themselves that their desire for gain is that they may\nhelp the cause of God. Some promise that when they have gained\nsuch an amount, then they will do good with it and advance the cause\nof present truth. But when they have realized their expectations, they\nare no more ready to help the cause than before. They again pledge\nthemselves that after they purchase that desirable house or piece of\nland, and pay for it, then they will do a great deal with their means to\nadvance the work of God. But as the desire of their heart is attained,\nthey have far less disposition than in the days of their poverty to\naid in the advancement of the work of God. \u201cHe also that received\nseed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of[478]\nthis world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he\nbecometh unfruitful.\u201d The deceitfulness of riches leads them on,\nstep by step, until they lose all love for the truth, and yet they flatter\nthemselves that they believe it. They love the world and the things\nof the world, but the love of God or of the truth is not in them.\nIn order to gain a little money, many deliberately arrange their\nbusiness matters so that it necessarily brings a great amount of hard\nwork upon those laboring out of doors, and upon their families\nin the house. The bone, muscle, and brain of all are taxed to the\nutmost; a great amount of work is before them to be done, and the\nexcuse is, they must accomplish just all that they possibly can or\nthere will be a loss, something will be wasted. Everything must\nOur Ministers 451\nbe saved, let the result be what it may. What have such gained?\nPerhaps they have been able to keep the principal good and add\nto it. But, on the other hand, what have they lost? Their capital\nof health, which is invaluable to the poor as well as the rich, has\nbeen steadily diminishing. The mother and the children have made\nrepeated drafts upon their fund of health and strength, thinking that\nsuch an extravagant expenditure would never exhaust their capital,\nuntil they are surprised at last to find their vigor of life exhausted.\nThey have nothing left to draw upon in case of emergency. The\nsweetness and happiness of life is embittered by racking pains and\nsleepless nights. Both physical and mental vigor are gone. The\nhusband and father, who, for the sake of gain, made the unwise\narrangement of his business, it may be with the full sanction of the\nwife and mother, may, as the result, bury the mother and one or more\nof the children. Health and life were sacrificed for the love of money.\n\u201cFor the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some\ncoveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves\nthrough with many sorrows.\u201d\nThere is a great work to be accomplished for Sabbathkeepers.\nTheir eyes must be opened and they see their true condition, and be [479]\nzealous and repent, or they will fail of everlasting life. The spirit\nof the world has taken possession of them, and they are brought\ninto captivity by the powers of darkness. They do not heed the\nexhortation of the apostle Paul: \u201cAnd be not conformed to this\nworld: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye\nmay prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of\nGod.\u201d With many, a worldly spirit, with covetousness and selfishness,\npredominates. Those who possess it are looking out for their own\nspecial interest. The selfish rich man does not interest himself in the\nthings of his neighbors, unless it be to study how he can advantage\nhimself at their disadvantage. The noble and godlike in man is parted\nwith, sacrificed for selfish interests. The love of money is the root\nof all evil. It blinds the vision and prevents people from discerning\ntheir obligations to God or to their neighbors.\nSome flatter themselves that they are liberal because they at\ntimes donate freely to ministers and for the advancement of the\ntruth. Yet these so-called liberal men are close in their deal and\nready to overreach. They have abundance of this world, and this\n452 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbinds upon them great responsibilities as God\u2019s stewards. Yet, when\ndealing with a poor, hard-laboring brother, they are exacting to the\nlast farthing. The poor side to a bargain is the poor man\u2019s legacy.\nInstead of favoring his poor brother, the sharp, exacting rich man\ntakes all the advantage and adds to his already accumulated wealth\nby the misfortune of the other. He prides himself because of his\nshrewdness, but with his wealth he is heaping up to himself a heavy\ncurse and laying a stumbling block in the way of his brother. By his\nmeanness and close calculation he is cutting off his ability to benefit\nhim with his religious influence. All this lives in the memory of that\npoor brother, and the most earnest prayers and apparently zealous\ntestimonies from his rich brother\u2019s lips will only have an influence[480]\nto grieve and disgust. He looks upon him as a hypocrite; a root\nof bitterness springs up whereby many are defiled. The poor man\ncannot forget the advantages taken of him; neither can he forget how\nhe has been crowded into difficult places because he was willing to\nbear burdens, while the wealthy brother ever had some excuse ready\nfor not putting his shoulder under the load. Yet the poor man may\nbe so imbued with the spirit of Christ as to forgive the abuses of his\nrich brother.\nTrue, noble, disinterested benevolence is too rarely found among\nthe wealthy. In their ambition for wealth they overlook the claims\nof humanity. They cannot see and feel the cramped, disagreeable\nposition of their brethren in poverty, who perhaps have labored as\nhard as themselves. Like Cain they say: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\n\u201cI have worked hard for what I have; I must hold on to it.\u201d Instead\nof praying, \u201cHelp me to feel my brother\u2019s woe,\u201d their constant study\nis to forget that he has any woes, any claims upon their sympathy or\nliberalities.\nMany Sabbathkeepers who are wealthy are guilty of grinding\nthe face of the poor. Do such think that God takes no notice of their\nlittle acts of meanness? If their eyes could be opened they would see\nan angel following them wherever they go, making a faithful record\nof all their acts in their families and at their places of business. The\nTrue Witness is on their track, declaring: \u201c I know thy works.\u201d As\nI saw this spirit of defrauding, of overreaching, of meanness, even\namong some professed Sabbathkeepers, I cried out in anguish of\nspirit. This great evil, this terrible curse, is folding around some\nOur Ministers 453\nof the Israel of God in these last days, making them a detestation\nto even noble-spirited unbelievers. This is the people professedly\nwaiting for the coming of the Lord.\nThere is a class of poor brethren who are not free from tempta-\ntion. They are poor managers, they have not wise judgment, they\nwish to obtain means without waiting the slow process of perse- [481]\nvering toil. Some are in such haste to better their condition that\nthey engage in various enterprises without consulting men of good\njudgment and experience. Their expectations are seldom realized;\ninstead of gaining, they lose, and then come temptation and a dis-\nposition to envy the rich. They really want to be benefited by the\nwealth of their brethren, and feel tried because they are not. But\nthey are not worthy of receiving special help. They have evidence\nthat their efforts have been scattered. They have been changeable in\nbusiness, and full of anxiety and cares which bring but small returns.\nSuch persons should listen to the counsel of those of experience.\nBut frequently they are the last ones to seek advice. They think they\nhave superior judgment and will not be taught.\nThese are often the very ones who are deceived by those sharp,\nshrewd peddlers of patent rights whose success depends upon the art\nof deception. These should learn that no confidence whatever can be\nput in such peddlers. But the brethren are credulous in regard to the\nvery things they should suspect and shun. They do not take home\nthe instruction of Paul to Timothy: \u201cBut godliness with contentment\nis great gain.\u201d \u201cAnd having food and raiment let us be therewith\ncontent.\u201d Let not the poor think that the rich are the only covetous\nones. While the rich hold what they have with a covetous grasp, and\nseek to obtain still more, the poor are in great danger of coveting the\nrich man\u2019s wealth. There are very few in our land of plenty who are\nreally so poor as to need help. If they would pursue a right course,\nthey could in almost every case be above want. My appeal to the\nrich is, Deal liberally with your poor brethren, and use your means\nto advance the cause of God. The worthy poor, those who are made\npoor by misfortune and sickness, deserve your special care and help.\n\u201cFinally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,\nlove as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous.\u201d\nMen and women professing godliness and expecting translation [482]\nto heaven without seeing death, I warn you to be less greedy of\n454 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngain, less self-caring. Redeem your godlike manhood, your noble\nwomanhood, by noble acts of disinterested benevolence. Heartily\ndespise your former avaricious spirit and regain true nobility of soul.\nFrom what God has shown me, unless you zealously repent, Christ\nwill spew you out of His mouth. Sabbathkeeping Adventists profess\nto be followers of Christ, but the works of many of them belie their\nprofession. \u201cYe shall know them by their fruits.\u201d \u201cNot everyone that\nsaith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;\nbut he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.\u201d\nI appeal to all who profess to believe the truth, to consider the\ncharacter and life of the Son of God. He is our example. His life\nwas marked with disinterested benevolence. He was ever touched\nwith human woe. He went about doing good. There was not one\nselfish act in all His life. His love for the fallen race, His desire\nto save them, was so great that He took upon Himself the wrath of\nHis Father, and consented to suffer the penalty of that transgression\nwhich plunged guilty man in degradation. He bore the sins of man\nin His own body. \u201cHe hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no\nsin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.\u201d\nTrue generosity is too frequently destroyed by prosperity and\nriches. Men and women in adversity or in humble poverty will\nsometimes express very great love for the truth and special interest\nfor the prosperity of the cause of God and for the salvation of their\nfellow men, and will tell what they would do if they only had the\nmeans. God frequently proves these; He prospers them, blesses them\nin basket and in store, far beyond their expectations. But their hearts\nare deceitful. Their good intentions and promises are like the rolling\nsand. The more they have the more they desire. The more they are\nprospered the more eager are they for gain. Some of these, who in[483]\ntheir poverty were once even benevolent, become penurious and ex-\nacting. Money becomes their god. They delight in the power which\nmoney gives them, in the honor they receive because of it. Said the\nangel: \u201cMark ye how they stand the test. Watch the development\nof character under the influence of riches.\u201d Some were oppressing\nthe needy poor and would obtain their services for the lowest figure.\nThey were overbearing; money was power to them. God\u2019s eye, I\nsaw, was upon them. They were deceived. \u201cAnd, behold, I come\nOur Ministers 455\nquickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as\nhis work shall be.\u201d\nSome who are wealthy do not withhold from ministers. They\nkeep up their systematic benevolence exactly and pride themselves\nupon their punctuality and generosity, and think their duty ends here.\nThis is well as far as it goes, but their duty does not cease here. God\nhas claims upon them that they do not realize. Society has claims\nupon them; their fellow men have claims upon them. Every member\nof their family has claims upon them. All these claims should be\nregarded; not one should be overlooked or neglected. Some men\ngive to ministers and put into the treasury with as much satisfaction\nas though it would entitle them to heaven. Some think that they can\ndo nothing to aid the cause of God unless they constantly have a\nlarge increase. They feel that they can in nowise touch the principal.\nShould our Saviour speak the same words to them that He did to\nthe certain ruler, \u201cGo and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,\nand thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me,\u201d\nthey would go away sorrowful, choosing like him to run the risk\nof retaining their idols, riches, rather than to part with them to\nsecure treasure in heaven. This ruler claimed that he had kept all\nthe commandments of God from his youth up, and confident in\nhis fidelity and righteousness, and thinking that he was perfect, he [484]\nasks: \u201cWhat lack I yet?\u201d Jesus immediately tears off his sense of\nsecurity by referring to his idols, his possessions. He had other gods\nbefore the Lord, which were of greater value to him than eternal life.\nSupreme love to God was lacking. Thus it is with some who profess\nto believe the truth. They think they are perfect, think that there is\nno lack, when they are far from perfection and are cherishing idols\nwhich will shut them out of heaven.\nMany pity the Southern slaves because they are bound down\nto labor, while slavery exists in their own families. Mothers and\nchildren are allowed to toil from morning till night; they have no\nrecreation. A ceaseless round of labor is before them and crowded\nupon them. They profess to be Christ\u2019s followers; but where is the\ntime for them to meditate and pray, and obtain food for the intellect,\nthat the mind, with which we serve God, may not be dwarfed in its\ngrowth? God calls upon every individual to use the talents He has\ncommitted to them to His glory, and by thus improving them to gain\n456 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nothers also. God has laid obligations upon us to benefit others. Our\nwork in this world for the good of others is not done until Christ\nshall say in heaven: \u201cIt is done.\u201d \u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust\nstill: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is\nrighteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be\nholy still.\u201d\nMany seem to have no true sense of their responsibility before\nGod. They are required to strive to enter in at the strait gate, because\nmany shall seek to enter in and shall not be able. Heaven requires\nthem to try to induce others also to strive to enter in at the strait\ngate. A work is before young and old to labor earnestly to save not\nonly their own souls, but the souls of others. There are none who\nhave reasoning faculties who have not some influence. By their\nindifference they use that influence to hinder souls from striving to\nenter in at the strait gate, or by their earnest, persevering, untiring\nefforts they urge upon them the necessity of striving diligently to[485]\nenter there. No one occupies a neutral position, doing nothing to\nencourage others and doing nothing to hinder them. Says Christ:\nThey that gather not with Me scatter abroad. Take heed, old and\nyoung; you are either doing the work of Christ, to save souls, or the\nwork of Satan, to lead them to perdition. \u201cLet your light so shine\nbefore men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your\nFather which is in heaven.\u201d\nThe young can exert a powerful influence if they will give up\ntheir pride and selfishness, and devote themselves to God; but as\na general thing they will not bear burdens for others. They have\nto be carried themselves. The time has come when God requires a\nchange in this respect. He calls upon young and old to be zealous\nand repent. If they continue in their state of lukewarmness, He will\nspew them out of His mouth. Says the True Witness: \u201cI know thy\nworks.\u201d Young man, young woman, your works are known, whether\nthey be good or whether they be evil. Are you rich in good works?\nJesus comes to you as a counselor: \u201cI counsel thee to buy of Me\ngold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment,\nthat thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do\nnot appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest\nsee.\u201d\nOur Ministers 457\n* * * * *\nChapter 85\u2014The Health Reform\nIn the vision given me in Rochester, New York, December 25,\n1865, I was shown that our Sabbathkeeping people have been negli-\ngent in acting upon the light which God has given in regard to the\nhealth reform, that there is yet a great work before us, and that as\na people we have been too backward to follow in God\u2019s opening\nprovidence as He has chosen to lead us.\nI was shown that the work of health reform has scarcely been[486]\nentered upon yet. While some feel deeply and act out their faith\nin the work, others remain indifferent and have scarcely taken the\nfirst step in reform. There seems to be in them a heart of unbelief,\nand, as this reform restricts the lustful appetite, many shrink back.\nThey have other gods before the Lord. Their taste, their appetite, is\ntheir god; and when the ax is laid at the root of the tree and those\nwho have indulged their depraved appetites at the expense of health\nare touched, their sin pointed out, their idols shown them, they do\nnot wish to be convinced; and although God\u2019s voice should speak\ndirectly to them to put away those health-destroying indulgences,\nsome would still cling to the hurtful things which they love. They\nseem joined to their idols, and God will soon say to His angels: Let\nthem alone.\nThe health reform, I was shown, is a part of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage and is just as closely connected with it as are the arm\nand hand with the human body. I saw that we as a people must\nmake an advance move in this great work. Ministers and people\nmust act in concert. God\u2019s people are not prepared for the loud cry\nof the third angel. They have a work to do for themselves which\nthey should not leave for God to do for them. He has left this\nwork for them to do. It is an individual work; one cannot do it for\nanother. \u201cHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us\ncleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting\nholiness in the fear of God.\u201d Gluttony is the prevailing sin of this\nage. Lustful appetite makes slaves of men and women, and beclouds\n458\nHealth Reform 459\ntheir intellects and stupefies their moral sensibilities to such a degree\nthat the sacred, elevated truths of God\u2019s word are not appreciated.\nThe lower propensities have ruled men and women.\nIn order to be fitted for translation, the people of God must know\nthemselves. They must understand in regard to their own physical [487]\nframes that they may be able with the psalmist to exclaim: \u201cI will\npraise Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\u201d They should\never have the appetite in subjection to the moral and intellectual\norgans. The body should be servant to the mind, and not the mind to\nthe body.\nI was shown that there is a much greater work before us than\nwe as yet have any idea of, if we would ensure health by placing\nourselves in the right relation to life. Dr. A has been doing a great\nand good work in the treatment of disease and in enlightening those\nwho have all their lives been in ignorance in regard to the relation that\neating, drinking, and working sustain to health. God in His mercy\nhas given His people light through His humble instrument that in\norder to overcome disease they must deny a depraved appetite and\npractice temperance in all things. He has caused great light to shine\nupon their pathway. Shall those who are \u201clooking for that blessed\nhope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour\nJesus Christ; who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from\nall iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of\ngood works,\u201d be behind the religionists of the day who have no faith\nin the soon appearing of our Saviour? The peculiar people whom\nHe is purifying unto Himself to be translated to heaven without\nseeing death, should not be behind others in good works. In their\nefforts to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,\nperfecting holiness in the fear of God, they should be as far ahead\nof any other class of people on the earth as their profession is more\nexalted than that of others.\nSome have sneered at this work of reform and have said it was\nall unnecessary, that it was an excitement to divert minds from\npresent truth. They have said that matters were being carried to\nextremes. Such do not know what they are talking about. While\nmen and women professing godliness are diseased from the crown\nof their head to the soles of their feet, while their physical, mental, [488]\nand moral energies are enfeebled through gratification of depraved\n460 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nappetite and excessive labor, how can they weigh the evidences of\ntruth and comprehend the requirements of God? If their moral and\nintellectual faculties are beclouded, they cannot appreciate the value\nof the atonement or the exalted character of the work of God, nor\ndelight in the study of His word. How can a nervous dyspeptic\nbe ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh him a\nreason of the hope that is in him, with meekness and fear? How soon\nwould such a one become confused and agitated, and by his diseased\nimagination be led to view matters in altogether a wrong light, and\nby a lack of that meekness and calmness which characterized the\nlife of Christ be caused to dishonor his profession while contending\nwith unreasonable men? Viewing matters from a high religious\nstandpoint, we must be thorough reformers in order to be Christlike.\nI saw that our heavenly Father has bestowed upon us the great\nblessing of light upon the health reform that we may obey the claims\nwhich He has upon us and glorify Him in our bodies and spirits\nwhich are His and finally stand without fault before the throne of\nGod. Our faith requires us to elevate the standard and take advance\nsteps. While many question the course pursued by other health\nreformers, they as reasonable men should do something themselves.\nOur race is in a deplorable condition, suffering from disease of every\ndescription. Many have inherited disease and are great sufferers\nbecause of the wrong habits of their parents, and yet they pursue\nthe same wrong course in regard to themselves and their children\nwhich was pursued toward them. They are ignorant in regard to\nthemselves. They are sick and do not know that their own wrong\nhabits are causing them immense suffering.\nThere are but few as yet who are aroused sufficiently to\nunderstand how much their habits of diet have to do with their health,[489]\ntheir characters, their usefulness in this world, and their eternal des-\ntiny. I saw that it is the duty of those who have received the light\nfrom heaven and have realized the benefit of walking in it, to man-\nifest a greater interest for those who are still suffering for want of\nknowledge. Sabbathkeepers who are looking for the soon appearing\nof their Saviour should be the last to manifest a lack of interest in\nthis great work of reform. Men and women must be instructed, and\nministers and people should feel that the burden of the work rests\nupon them to agitate the subject and urge it home upon others.\nHealth Reform 461\nI was shown that we should provide a home for the afflicted\nand those who wish to learn how to take care of their bodies that\nthey may prevent sickness. We should not remain indifferent and\ncompel those who are sick and desirous of living out the truth to go\nto popular water cure institutions for the recovery of health, where\nthere is no sympathy for our faith. If they recover health it may be at\nthe expense of their religious faith. Those who have suffered greatly\nfrom bodily infirmities are weak both mentally and morally. As they\nrealize the benefit derived from the correct application of water, the\nright use of air, and a proper diet, they are led to believe that the\nphysicians who understood how to treat them so successfully cannot\nbe greatly at fault in their religious faith; that as they are engaged\nin the great and good work of benefiting suffering humanity, they\nmust be nearly or quite right. And thus our people are in danger\nof being ensnared through their efforts to recover health at these\nestablishments.\nAgain I was shown that those who are strongly fortified with\nreligious principles and are firm to obey all God\u2019s requirements\ncannot receive that benefit from the popular health institutions of the\nday that others of a different faith can. Sabbathkeepers are singular\nin their faith. To keep all God\u2019s commandments as He requires them [490]\nto do in order to be owned and approved of Him is exceedingly\ndifficult in a popular water cure. They have to carry along with them\nat all times the gospel sieve and sift everything they hear, that they\nmay choose the good and refuse the bad.\nThe water cure establishment at ----- has been the best institution\nin the United States. Its managers have been doing a great and good\nwork as far as the treatment of disease is concerned. Yet we cannot\nhave confidence in their religious principles. While they profess\nto be Christians, they recommend to their patients card playing,\ndancing, and attending theaters, all of which have a tendency to\nevil, or, to say the very least, have the appearance of evil, and\nare directly contrary to the teachings of Christ and His apostles.\nConscientious Sabbathkeepers who visit these institutions for the\npurpose of regaining health cannot receive the benefit they would\nif they were not obliged to keep themselves constantly guarded lest\nthey compromise their faith, dishonor the cause of their Redeemer,\nand bring their own souls into bondage.\n462 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI was shown that Sabbathkeepers should open a way for those\nof like precious faith to be benefited without their being under the\nnecessity of expending their means at institutions where their faith\nand religious principles are endangered, and where they can find\nno sympathy or union in religious matters. God in His providence\ndirected the course of Dr. B to ----- that he might there obtain an\nexperience he would not otherwise have gained, for He had a work\nfor him to do in the health reform. As a practicing physician he\nhad for years been obtaining a knowledge of the human system,\nand God would now have him by precept and practice learn how\nto apply the blessings placed within the reach of man. He would\nhave him become prepared to benefit the sick and instruct those\nwho do not understand how to preserve the strength and health they[491]\nalready have, and how to prevent disease by a wise use of heaven\u2019s\nremedies\u2014pure water, air, and diet.\nI was shown that Dr. B was a cautious and strictly conscientious\nman, a man whom God loves. He has passed through many trials\nwhich have worked for his good, although while passing through\nthem he could not at all times see how he was to be benefited by\nthem. Dr. B is not a man who will become exalted while he believes\nthe truth and follows in its path. He is not a man who will be arbitrary\nor overbearing. He is too fearful of putting on that dignity which his\nposition would allow him to maintain. He will counsel with others\nand is easy to be entreated; his great danger will be a willingness to\ntake on burdens which he ought not to bear. He sees and feels what\nought to be done, and will be in danger of doing too much. He is\nextremely sensitive and sympathetic, and will feel to the very depth\nfor all his patients; and if he is permitted, will carry so heavy a load\nof responsibility as to be crushed under its weight.\nMen and women of influence should help Brother B by their\nprayers, their sympathy, their hearty cooperation, their cheering,\nhopeful words, and their counsel and advice\u2014all of which will be\nappreciated by him. His position cannot be an enviable one. If he\nassumes so great responsibilities it will not be from choice or to\nobtain a livelihood, for he can procure this in a much easier way and\navoid the care, anxiety, and perplexity which such a position would\nbring upon him. Duty alone will lead him; and when once convinced\nwhere the path of duty lies, he will follow it and stand at his post, let\nHealth Reform 463\nthe consequences be what they may. He should have the sympathy\nand co-operation of those who have influence, those whom God\nwould have stand by his side and sustain him in his laborious work.\nDr. B could, so far as this world is concerned, do better than in\nthe position he now occupies. I was shown that this position would [492]\nbe most difficult. Many who have no experience would have no\nidea of the magnitude of the enterprise and would want things to go\naccording to their ideas. Some would wonder why the poor could\nnot come and be treated for nothing, and would be tempted to think\nthat it was a money-making enterprise after all; and this one and\nthat one would wish to have something to say, and would have just\nabout so much fault to find, let matters go as they might; for I was\nshown that some would consider it a virtue to be jealous and stand\nout and oppose. They pride themselves on not receiving everything\njust as soon as it comes. Like Thomas, they boast of their unbelief.\nBut did Jesus commend unbelieving Thomas? While granting him\nthe evidence he had declared that he would have before believing,\nJesus said unto him: \u201cThomas because thou hast seen Me, thou hast\nbelieved: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.\u201d\nI was shown that there is no lack of means among Sabbathkeep-\ning Adventists. At present their greatest danger is in their accumula-\ntions of property. Some are continually increasing their cares and\nlabors; they are overcharged. The result is, God and the wants of His\ncause are nearly forgotten by them; they are spiritually dead. They\nare required to make a sacrifice to God, an offering. A sacrifice does\nnot increase, but decreases and consumes. Here, I was shown, was a\nworthy enterprise for God\u2019s people to engage in, one in which they\ncan invest means to His glory and the advancement of His cause.\nMuch of the means among our people is only proving an injury to\nthose who are holding on to it.\nOur people should have an institution of their own, under their\nown control, for the benefit of the diseased and suffering among us\nwho wish to have health and strength that they may glorify God in\ntheir bodies and spirits, which are His. Such an institution, rightly\nconducted, would be the means of bringing our views before many [493]\nwhom it would be impossible for us to reach by the common course\nof advocating the truth. As unbelievers shall resort to an institution\ndevoted to the successful treatment of disease and conducted by\n464 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nSabbathkeeping physicians, they will be brought directly under the\ninfluence of the truth. By becoming acquainted with our people\nand our real faith, their prejudice will be overcome and they will be\nfavorably impressed. By thus being placed under the influence of\ntruth, some will not only obtain relief from bodily infirmities, but\nwill find a healing balm for their sin-sick souls.\nAs the health of invalids improves under judicious treatment,\nand they begin to enjoy life, they have confidence in those who have\nbeen instrumental in their restoration to health. Their hearts are\nfilled with gratitude, and the good seed of truth will the more readily\nfind a lodgment there and in some cases will be nourished, spring\nup, and bear fruit to the glory of God. One such precious soul saved\nwill be worth more than all the means needed to establish such an\ninstitution. Some will not have enough moral courage to yield to\ntheir convictions. They may be convinced that Sabbathkeepers have\nthe truth, but the world and unbelieving relatives stand in the way\nof their receiving it. They cannot bring their minds to the point to\nsacrifice all for Christ. Yet some of this last-mentioned class will go\naway with their prejudice removed and will stand as defenders of\nthe faith of Seventh-day Adventists. Some who go away restored or\ngreatly benefited will be the means of introducing our faith in new\nplaces and raising the standard of truth where it would have been\nimpossible to gain access had not prejudice been first removed from\nminds by a tarry among our people for the object of gaining health.\nOthers will prove a source of trial as they go to their homes. Yet\nthis should not discourage any or hinder them in their efforts in this\ngood work. Satan and his agents will do all they can to hinder, to[494]\nperplex, and to bring burdens upon those who heartily engage in the\nwork of advancing this reform.\nThere is a liberal supply of means among our people, and if all\nfelt the importance of the work, this great enterprise could be carried\nforward without embarrassment. All should feel a special interest in\nsustaining it. Especially should those who have means invest in this\nenterprise. A suitable home should be fitted up for the reception of\ninvalids that they may, by the use of proper means and the blessing\nof God, be relieved of their infirmities and learn how to take care of\nthemselves and thus prevent sickness.\nHealth Reform 465\nMany who profess the truth are growing close and covetous.\nThey need to be alarmed for themselves. They have so much of their\ntreasure upon the earth that their hearts are on their treasure. Much\nthe larger share of their treasure is in this world and but little in\nheaven; therefore their affections are placed on earthly possessions\ninstead of on the heavenly inheritance. There is now a good opportu-\nnity for them to use their means for the benefit of suffering humanity\nand also for the advancement of the truth. This enterprise should\nnever be left to struggle in poverty. These stewards to whom God\nhas entrusted means should now come up to the work and use their\nmeans to His glory. To those who through covetousness withhold\ntheir means, it will prove a curse rather than a blessing.\nThose to whom God has entrusted means should provide a fund\nto be used for the benefit of the worthy poor who are sick and not\nable to defray the expenses of receiving treatment at the institution.\nThere are some precious, worthy poor whose influence has been a\nbenefit to the cause of God. A fund should be raised to be used for\nthe express purpose of treating such of the poor as the church where\nthey reside shall decide are worthy to be benefited. Unless those who\nhave an abundance give for this object, without calling for returns, [495]\nthe poor will be unable to avail themselves of the benefits derived\nfrom the treatment of disease at such an institution, where so much\nmeans is required for labor bestowed. Such an institution should\nnot in its infancy, while struggling to live, become embarrassed by a\nconstant expenditure of means without realizing any returns.\n466 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber Twelve\u2014Testimony for the [496]\nChurch\nChapter 86\u2014Address to the Young\nYoung Sabbathkeepers are given to pleasure seeking. I saw that\nthere is not one in twenty who knows what experimental religion\nis. They are constantly grasping after something to satisfy their\ndesire for change, for amusement; and unless they are undeceived\nand their sensibilities aroused so that they can say from the heart,\n\u201cI count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of\nChrist Jesus my Lord,\u201d they are not worthy of Him and will come\nshort of everlasting life. The young, generally, are in a terrible\ndeception, and yet they profess godliness. Their unconsecrated lives\nare a reproach to the Christian name; their example is a snare to\nothers. They hinder the sinner, for in nearly every respect they are no\nbetter than unbelievers. They have the word of God, but its warnings,\nadmonitions, reproofs, and corrections are unheeded, as are also the\nencouragements and promises to the obedient and faithful. God\u2019s\npromises are all on condition of humble obedience. One pattern\nonly is given to the young, but how do their lives compare with the\nlife of Christ? I feel alarmed as I witness everywhere the frivolity\nof young men and young women who profess to believe the truth.\nGod does not seem to be in their thoughts. Their minds are filled\nwith nonsense. Their conversation is only empty, vain talk. They[497]\nhave a keen ear for music, and Satan knows what organs to excite to\nanimate, engross, and charm the mind so that Christ is not desired.\nThe spiritual longings of the soul for divine knowledge, for a growth\nin grace, are wanting.\nI was shown that the youth must take a higher stand and make\nthe word of God the man of their counsel and their guide. Solemn\nresponsibilities rest upon the young, which they lightly regard. The\nintroduction of music into their homes, instead of inciting to holiness\nand spirituality, has been the means of diverting their minds from the\ntruth. Frivolous songs and the popular sheet music of the day seem\ncongenial to their taste. The instruments of music have taken time\nwhich should have been devoted to prayer. Music, when not abused,\n468\nAddress to the Young 469\nis a great blessing; but when put to a wrong use, it is a terrible\ncurse. It excites, but does not impart that strength and courage which\nthe Christian can find only at the throne of grace while humbly\nmaking known his wants and with strong cries and tears pleading\nfor heavenly strength to be fortified against the powerful temptations\nof the evil one. Satan is leading the young captive. Oh, what can I\nsay to lead them to break his power of infatuation! He is a skillful\ncharmer, luring them on to perdition. Listen to the instructions from\nthe Inspired Book of God. I saw that Satan had blinded the minds of\nthe youth that they could not comprehend the truths of God\u2019s word.\nTheir sensibilities are so blunted that they regard not the injunctions\nof the holy apostle:\n\u201cChildren, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honor\nthy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;\nthat it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the\n[new] earth.\u201d \u201cChildren, obey your parents in all things: for this is\nwell pleasing unto the Lord.\u201d Children who dishonor and disobey\ntheir parents, and disregard their advice and instructions, can have\nno part in the earth made new. The purified new earth will be\nno place for the rebellious, the disobedient, the ungrateful, son or [498]\ndaughter. Unless such learn obedience and submission here, they\nwill never learn it; the peace of the ransomed will not be marred\nby disobedient, unruly, unsubmissive children. No commandment\nbreaker can inherit the kingdom of heaven. Will all the youth please\nread the fifth commandment of the law spoken by Jehovah from Sinai\nand engraven with His own finger upon tables of stone? \u201cHonor\nthy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land\nwhich the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d\nI was referred to many passages of Scripture that clearly show the\nyoung the will of God concerning them. These plain teachings they\nmust meet in the judgment. Yet there is not one young man or young\nwoman in twenty professing the present truth who heeds these Bible\nteachings. The youth do not read the word of God enough to know\nits claims upon them; and yet these truths will judge them in the\ngreat day of God, when young and old will be rewarded according\nto the deeds done in the body.\nSays John: \u201cI have written unto you, young men, because ye are\nstrong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome\n470 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthe wicked one. Love not the world, neither the things that are in\nthe world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not\nin him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust\nof the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the\nworld. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that\ndoeth the will of God abideth forever.\u201d\nThis exhortation to young men extends to young women also.\nTheir youth does not excuse them from the responsibilities resting\nupon them. They are strong and are not worn down with cares\nand the weight of years; their affections are ardent, and if they\nwithdraw these from the world and place them upon Christ and\nheaven, doing the will of God, they will have a hope of the better\nlife that is enduring, and they will abide forever, being crowned with[499]\nglory, honor, immortality, eternal life. If the youth live to gratify the\nlust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, they are\nseeking for the things of the world, pleasing their great adversary,\nand separating themselves from the Father. And when these things\nthat are sought after pass away, their hopes are blasted and their\nexpectations perish. Separated from God they will then bitterly\nrepent their folly in serving their own pleasure, gratifying their own\ndesires, and for a few frivolous enjoyments selling a life of bliss that\nthey might have enjoyed forever.\n\u201cLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world,\u201d\nsays the inspired apostle. Then he adds the warning: \u201cIf any man\nlove the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d It is an alarming\nfact that the love of the world predominates in the minds of the\nyoung. They decidedly love the world and the things that are in\nthe world, and for this very reason the love of God finds no room\nin their hearts. They find their pleasures in the world and in the\nthings of the world, and are strangers to the Father and the graces\nof His Spirit. God is dishonored by the frivolity and fashion, and\nempty, vain talking and laughing that characterize the life of the\nyouth generally. Paul exhorts the youth to sobriety: \u201cYoung men\nlikewise exhort to be sober-minded. In all things showing thyself a\npattern of good works: in doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,\nsincerity, sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is\nof the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of\nyou.\u201d\nAddress to the Young 471\nI entreat the youth for their souls\u2019 sake to heed the exhortation of\nthe inspired apostle. All these gracious instructions, warnings, and\nreproofs will be either a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.\nMany of the young are reckless in their conversation. They choose\nto forget that by their words they are to be justified or condemned.\nAll should take heed to the words of our Saviour: \u201cA good man out\nof the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an [500]\nevil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say\nunto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give\naccount thereof in the day of judgment. For by thy words thou shalt\nbe justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.\u201d How little\nregard is paid even to the instructions of the heavenly Teacher. Many\neither do not study the word of God or do not heed its solemn truths,\nand these plain truths will rise up in judgment and condemn them.\nWords and acts testify plainly what is in the heart. If vanity and\npride, love of self and love of dress, fill the heart, the conversation\nwill be upon the fashions, the dress, and the appearance, but not\non Christ or the kingdom of heaven. If envious feelings dwell\nin the heart, they will be manifested in words and acts. Those\nwho measure themselves by others, do as others do, and make no\nhigher attainments, excusing themselves because of the faults and\nwrongs of others, are feeding on husks and will remain spiritual\ndwarfs as long as they gratify Satan by thus indulging their own\nunconsecrated feelings. Some dwell upon what they shall eat and\ndrink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed. These thoughts flow\nout from the abundance of the heart, as though temporal things were\nthe grand aim in life, the highest attainment. These persons forget\nthe words of Christ: \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and His\nrighteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d\nThe youth have their hearts filled with the love of self. This is\nmanifested in their desire to see their faces daguerreotyped by the\nartist; and they are not satisfied with being once represented, but\nsit again and again for their picture, each time hoping that the last\nwill excel all their previous efforts and appear really more beautiful\nthan the original. Their Lord\u2019s money is squandered in this way, and\nwhat is gained? Merely their poor shadow upon paper. The hours\nthat should have been devoted to prayer are occupied upon their own [501]\npoor selves; precious hours of probation are thus wasted.\n472 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nSatan is gratified to have the attention of youth attracted by\nanything to divert their minds from God so that the deceiver can\nsteal a march upon them and they, unprepared for his attacks, be\nensnared. They are not aware that the great heavenly Artist is taking\ncognizance of every act, every word, and that their deportment, and\neven the thoughts and intents of the heart, stand faithfully delineated.\nEvery defect in their moral character stands revealed to the gaze\nof angels, and they will have the faithful picture presented to them\nin all its deformity at the execution of the judgment. Those vain,\nfrivolous words are all written in the book. Those false words are\nwritten. Those deceptive acts, whose motives were concealed from\nhuman eyes, but discerned by the all-seeing eye of Jehovah, are all\nwritten in living characters. Every selfish act is exposed.\nThe young generally conduct themselves as though the precious\nhours of probation, while mercy lingers, were one grand holiday,\nand they were placed in this world merely for their own amusement,\nto be gratified with a continued round of excitement. Satan has been\nmaking special efforts to lead them to find happiness in worldly\namusements and to justify themselves by endeavoring to show that\nthese amusements are harmless, innocent, and even important for\nhealth. The impression has been given by some physicians that\nspirituality and devotion to God are detrimental to health. This suits\nthe adversary of souls. There are persons with diseased imaginations\nwho do not rightly represent the religion of Christ; such have not\nthe pure religion of the Bible. Some are scourging themselves all\nthrough life because of their sins; all they can see is an offended God\nof justice. Christ and His redeeming power through the merits of His\nblood they fail to see. Such have not faith. This class are generally\nthose who have not well-balanced minds. Through disease transmit-\nted to them from their parents, and an erroneous education in youth,\nthey have contracted wrong habits which injure the constitution and[502]\nthe brain, causing the moral organs to become diseased and making\nit impossible for them to think and act rationally upon all points.\nThey have not well-balanced minds. Godliness and righteousness\nare not destructive to health, but are health to the body and strength\nto the soul. Says Peter: \u201cHe that will love life, and see good days,\n...let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue\nit: for the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are\nAddress to the Young 473\nopen unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that\ndo evil.\u201d \u201cBut and if ye suffer for righteousness\u2019 sake, happy are ye:\nand be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.\u201d\nThe consciousness of rightdoing is the best medicine for diseased\nbodies and minds. The special blessing of God resting upon the\nreceiver is health and strength. A person whose mind is quiet and\nsatisfied in God is in the pathway to health. To have a consciousness\nthat the eyes of the Lord are upon us and His ears open to our prayers\nis a satisfaction indeed. To know that we have a never-failing Friend\nin whom we can confide all the secrets of the soul is a privilege which\nwords can never express. Those whose moral faculties are beclouded\nby disease are not the ones to rightly represent the Christian life or\nthe beauties of holiness. They are too often in the fire of fanaticism or\nthe water of cold indifference or stolid gloom. The words of Christ\nare of more worth than the opinions of all the physicians in the\nuniverse: \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness;\nand all these things shall be added unto you.\u201d This is the first great\nobject\u2014the kingdom of heaven, the righteousness of Christ. Other\nobjects to be attained should be secondary to these.\nSatan will present the path of holiness as difficult while the paths\nof worldly pleasure are strewed with flowers. In false and flattering\ncolors will the tempter array the world with its pleasures before you. [503]\nVanity is one of the strongest traits of our depraved natures, and\nhe knows that he can appeal to it successfully. He will flatter you\nthrough his agents. You may receive praise which will gratify your\nvanity and foster in you pride and self-esteem, and you may think\nthat with such advantages and attractions it really is a great pity\nfor you to come out from the world and be separate, and become a\nChristian, to forsake your companions, and be alike dead to their\npraise or censure. Satan tells you that with the advantages which you\npossess you could to a high degree enjoy the pleasures of the world.\nBut consider that the pleasures of earth will have an end, and that\nwhich you sow you must also reap. Are personal attractions, ability,\nor talents too valuable to devote to God, the Author of your being,\nHe who watches over you every moment? Are your qualifications\ntoo precious to devote to God?\nThe young urge that they need something to enliven and divert\nthe mind. I saw that there is pleasure in industry, a satisfaction\n474 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin pursuing a life of usefulness. Some still urge that they must\nhave something to interest the mind when business ceases, some\nmental occupation or amusement to which the mind can turn for\nrelief and refreshment amid cares and wearing labor. The Christian\u2019s\nhope is just what is needed. Religion will prove to the believer a\ncomforter, a sure guide to the Fountain of true happiness. The young\nshould study the word of God and give themselves to meditation and\nprayer, and they will find that their spare moments cannot be better\nemployed. Young friends, you should take time to prove your own\nselves, whether you are in the love of God. Be diligent to make your\ncalling and election sure. It depends upon your own course of action\nwhether you secure to yourselves the better life.\nWisdom\u2019s \u201cways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths\nare peace.\u201d The future abode of the righteous and their everlasting[504]\nreward are high and ennobling themes for the young to contemplate.\nDwell upon the marvelous plan of salvation, the great sacrifice made\nby the King of glory that you might be elevated through the merits\nof His blood and by obedience finally be exalted to the throne of\nChrist. This subject should engage the noblest contemplation of the\nmind. To be brought into favor with God\u2014what a privilege! To\ncommune with Him\u2014what can more elevate, refine, and exalt us\nabove the frivolous pleasures of earth? To have our corrupt natures\nrenovated by grace, our lustful appetites and animal propensities in\nsubjection, to stand forth with noble, moral independence, achieving\nvictories every day, will give peace of conscience which can arise\nalone from rightdoing.\nYoung friends, I saw that with such employment and diversion as\nthis you might be happy. But the reason why you are restless is, you\ndo not seek to the only true source for happiness. You are ever trying\nto find out of Christ that enjoyment which is found only in Him. In\nHim are no disappointed hopes. Prayer, oh, how is this precious\nprivilege neglected! The reading of the word of God prepares the\nmind for prayer. One of the greatest reasons why you have so little\ndisposition to draw nearer to God by prayer is, you have unfitted\nyourselves for this sacred work by reading fascinating stories which\nhave excited the imagination and aroused unholy passions. The word\nof God becomes distasteful, the hour of prayer is forgotten. Prayer\nAddress to the Young 475\nis the strength of the Christian. When alone he is not alone; he feels\nthe presence of One who has said: \u201cLo, I am with you alway.\u201d\nThe young want just what they have not; namely,religion. Noth-\ning can take the place of this. Profession alone is nothing. Names\nare registered upon the church books upon earth, but not in the\nbook of life. I saw that there is not one in twenty of the youth who\nknows what experimental religion is. They serve themselves and [505]\nyet profess to be servants of Christ; but unless the spell which is\nupon them be broken, they will soon realize that the portion of the\ntransgressor is theirs. As for self-denial or sacrifice for the truth\u2019s\nsake, they have found an easier way above it all. As for the earnest\npleading with tears and strong cries to God for His pardoning grace\nand for strength from Him to resist the temptations of Satan, they\nhave found it unnecessary to be so earnest and zealous; they can get\nalong well without it. Christ, the King of glory, went often alone to\nthe mountains and desert places to pour out His soul\u2019s request to His\nFather; but sinful man, in whom is no strength, thinks he can live\nwithout so much prayer.\nChrist is our pattern; His life was an example of good works.\nHe was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. He wept\nover Jerusalem because they would not be saved by accepting the\nredemption which He offered them. They would not come to Him\nthat they might have life. Compare your course of life with that\nof your Master, who made so great a sacrifice that you might be\nsaved. He frequently spent the entire night upon the damp ground in\nagonizing prayer. You are seeking your own pleasure. Listen to the\nvain, frivolous conversation; hear the laugh, the jesting, the joking.\nIs this imitating the pattern? Still listen\u2014is Jesus mentioned? Is the\ntruth the theme of conversation? Are the speakers glorying in the\ncross of Christ? It is this fashion, that bonnet, that dress, what that\nyoung man said, or that young lady said, or the amusements they\nare planning. What glee! Are angels attracted and pressing close\naround them to ward off the darkness which Satan is pressing upon\nand around them? Oh, no. See, they turn away in sorrow. I see tears\nupon the faces of these angels. Can it be that angels of God are made\nto weep? It is even so.\nEternal things have little weight with the youth. Angels of God [506]\nare in tears as they write in the roll the words and acts of professed\n476 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nChristians. Angels are hovering around yonder dwelling. The young\nare there assembled; there is the sound of vocal and instrumental\nmusic. Christians are gathered there, but what is that you hear? It\nis a song, a frivolous ditty, fit for the dance hall. Behold the pure\nangels gather their light closer around them, and darkness envelops\nthose in that dwelling. The angels are moving from the scene.\nSadness is upon their countenances. Behold, they are weeping.\nThis I saw repeated a number of times all through the ranks of\nSabbathkeepers, and especially in ----- . Music has occupied the\nhours which should have been devoted to prayer. Music is the idol\nwhich many professed Sabbathkeeping Christians worship. Satan\nhas no objection to music if he can make that a channel through\nwhich to gain access to the minds of the youth. Anything will suit\nhis purpose that will divert the mind from God and engage the time\nwhich should be devoted to His service. He works through the\nmeans which will exert the strongest influence to hold the largest\nnumbers in a pleasing infatuation, while they are paralyzed by his\npower. When turned to good account, music is a blessing; but it\nis often made one of Satan\u2019s most attractive agencies to ensnare\nsouls. When abused, it leads the unconsecrated to pride, vanity, and\nfolly. When allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it\nis a terrible curse. Young persons assemble to sing, and, although\nprofessed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their\nfrivolous conversation and their choice of music. Sacred music is\nnot congenial to their taste. I was directed to the plain teachings of\nGod\u2019s word, which have been passed by unnoticed. In the judgment\nall these words of inspiration will condemn those who have not\nheeded them.\nThe apostle Paul exhorts Timothy \u201cby the commandment of God\nour Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ\u201d: \u201cI will therefore that men pray[507]\neverywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. In\nlike manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel,\nwith shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold,\nor pearls, or costly array; but (which becometh women professing\ngodliness) with good works.\u201d\nPeter writes to the church: \u201cWherefore gird up the loins of\nyour mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to\nbe brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; as obedient\nAddress to the Young 477\nchildren, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in\nyour ignorance: but as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye\nholy in all manner of conversation; because it is written, Be ye holy;\nfor I am holy.\u201d\nThe inspired Paul directs Titus to give special instructions to\nthe church of Christ, \u201cthat they may adorn the doctrine of God\nour Saviour in all things.\u201d He says: \u201cTeaching us that, denying\nungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously,\nand godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and\nthe glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\nwho gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity,\nand purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.\u201d\nPeter exhorts the churches to \u201cbe sober, be vigilant; because your\nadversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom\nhe may devour.\u201d \u201cThe end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore\nsober, and watch unto prayer.\u201d Again he says: \u201cBut sanctify the\nLord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to\nevery man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with\nmeekness and fear: having a good conscience; that, whereas they\nspeak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely\naccuse your good conversation in Christ. For it is better, if the will\nof God be so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.\u201d\nAre the youth in a position where they can with meekness and [508]\nfear give an answer to every man that asketh a reason of their hope? I\nsaw that the youth greatly fail of understanding our position. Terrible\nscenes are just before them, a time of trouble which will test the\nvalue of character. Those who have the truth abiding in them will\nthen be developed. Those who have shunned the cross, neglected\nthe word of life, and paid adoration to their own poor selves will\nbe found wanting. They are ensnared by Satan, and will learn too\nlate that they have made a terrible mistake. The pleasures they have\nsought after prove bitter in the end. Said the angel: \u201cSacrifice all\nfor God. Self must die. The natural desires and propensities of the\nunrenewed heart must be subdued.\u201d Flee to the neglected Bible; the\nwords of inspiration are spoken to you; pass them not lightly by.\nYou will meet every word again, to render an account whether you\nhave been a doer of the work, shaping your life according to the holy\nteachings of God\u2019s word. Holiness of heart and life are necessary.\n478 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nAll who have taken the name of Christ and have enlisted in His\nservice should be good soldiers of the cross. They should show that\nthey are dead to the world, and that their life is hid with Christ in\nGod.\nPaul writes to his Colossian brethren as follows: \u201cIf ye then be\nrisen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ\nsitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above,\nnot on things on the earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with\nChrist in God. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall\nye also appear with Him in glory.\u201d \u201cAnd above all these things put\non charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of\nGod rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body;\nand be ye thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in\nall wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and\nhymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the\nLord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of [509]\nthe Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him.\u201d\nTo the Ephesians he writes: \u201cSee then that ye walk circumspectly,\nnot as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are\nevil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will\nof the Lord is. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but\nbe filled with the Spirit; speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns\nand spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the\nLord; giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in\nthe name of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nGod is glorified by songs of praise from a pure heart filled with\nlove and devotion to Him. When consecrated believers assemble,\ntheir conversation will not be upon the imperfections of others or\nsavor of murmuring or complaint; charity, or love, the bond of\nperfectness, will encircle them. Love to God and their fellow men\nflows out naturally in words of affection, sympathy, and esteem\nfor their brethren. The peace of God rules in their hearts; their\nwords are not vain, empty, and frivolous, but to the comfort and\nedification of one another. If Christians will obey the instructions\ngiven to them by Christ and His inspired apostles, they will adorn\nthe religion of the Bible and save themselves severe trials and much\nperplexity which they attribute to their afflictions in consequence\nof believing unpopular truth. This is a sad mistake. Very many of\nAddress to the Young 479\ntheir trials are of their own creating because they depart from the\nword of God. They yield to the world, place themselves upon the\nenemy\u2019s battlefield, and tempt the devil to tempt them. Those who\nadhere strictly to the admonitions and instructions of God\u2019s word,\nprayerfully seeking to know and do His righteous will, feel not the\npetty grievances daily occurring. The gratitude which they feel, and\nthe peace of God ruling within, cause them to make melody in their\nhearts unto the Lord and by words to make mention of the debt of [510]\nlove and thankfulness due the dear Saviour, who so loved them as to\ndie that they might have life. No one who has an indwelling Saviour\nwill dishonor Him before others by producing strains from a musical\ninstrument which call the mind from God and heaven to light and\ntrifling things.\nThe young are required in whatsoever they do, in word or deed,\nto do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the\nFather by Him. I saw that but few of the youth understand what it is\nto be Christians, to be Christlike. They will have to learn the truths\nof God\u2019s word before they can conform their lives to the pattern.\nThere is not one young person in twenty who has experienced in his\nlife that separation from the world which the Lord requires of all\nwho would become members of His family, children of the heavenly\nKing. \u201cWherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate,\nsaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive\nyou, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and\ndaughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u201d\nWhat a promise is here made upon condition of obedience! Do\nyou have to cut loose from friends and relatives in deciding to obey\nthe elevated truths of God\u2019s word? Take courage, God has made\nprovision for you, His arms are open to receive you. Come out\nfrom among them and be separate, and touch not the unclean, and\nHe will receive you. He promises to be a Father unto you. Oh,\nwhat a relationship is this! higher and holier than any earthly tie.\nIf you make the sacrifice, if you have to forsake father, mother,\nsisters, brothers, wife, and children for Christ\u2019s sake, you will not be\nfriendless. God adopts you into His family; you become members\nof the royal household, sons and daughters of the King who rules\nin the heaven of heavens. Can you desire a more exalted position\nthan is here promised? Is not this enough? Said the angel: \u201cWhat\n480 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ncould God do for the children of men more than He has already\ndone? If such love, such exalted promises are not appreciated, could[511]\nHe devise anything higher, anything richer and more lofty? All that\nGod could do has been done for the salvation of man, and yet the\nhearts of the children of men have become hardened. Because of\nthe multiplicity of the blessings with which God has surrounded\nthem, they receive them as common things and forget their gracious\nBenefactor.\u201d\nI saw that Satan is a vigilant foe intent upon his purpose of\nleading the youth to a course of action entirely contrary to that\nwhich God would approve. He well knows that there is no other\nclass that can do as much good as young men and young women\nwho are consecrated to God. The youth, if right, could sway a\nmighty influence. Preachers, or laymen advanced in years, cannot\nhave one half the influence upon the young that the youth, devoted\nto God, can have upon their associates. They ought to feel that a\nresponsibility rests upon them to do all they can to save their fellow\nmortals, even at a sacrifice of their pleasure and natural desires.\nTime, and even means, if required, should be consecrated to God.\nAll who profess godliness should feel the danger of those who are\nout of Christ. Soon their probation will close. Those who might\nhave exerted an influence to save souls had they stood in the counsel\nof God, yet failed to do their duty through selfishness, indolence, or\nbecause they were ashamed of the cross of Christ, will not only lose\ntheir own souls, but will have the blood of poor sinners upon their\ngarments. Such will be required to render an account for the good\nthat they could have done had they been consecrated to God, but did\nnot do because of their unfaithfulness. Those who have really tasted\nthe sweets of redeeming love will not, cannot, rest until all with\nwhom they associate are made acquainted with the plan of salvation.\nThe young should inquire: \u201c\u2018Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u2019\nHow can I honor and glorify Thy name upon the earth?\u201d Souls are\nperishing all around us, and yet what burden do the youth bear to win[512]\nsouls to Christ? Those who attend school could have an influence\nfor the Saviour; but who name the name of Christ? and who are seen\npleading with tender earnestness with their companions to forsake\nthe ways of sin and choose the path of holiness?\nAddress to the Young 481\nI was shown that this is the course which the believing young\nshould take, but they do not; it is more congenial to their feelings to\nunite with the sinner in sport and pleasure. The young have a wide\nsphere of usefulness, but they see it not. Oh, that they would now\nexert their powers of mind in seeking ways to approach perishing\nsinners, that they might make known to them the path of holiness,\nand by prayer and entreaty win even one soul to Christ! What a\nnoble enterprise! One soul to praise God through eternity! One soul\nto enjoy happiness and everlasting life! One gem in their crown\nto shine as a star for ever and ever! But even more than one can\nbe brought to turn from error to truth, from sin to holiness. Says\nthe Lord by the prophet: \u201cAnd they that turn many to righteousness\n[shall shine] as the stars for ever and ever.\u201d Then those who engage\nwith Christ and angels in the work of saving perishing souls are\nrichly rewarded in the kingdom of heaven.\nI saw that many souls might be saved if the young were where\nthey ought to be, devoted to God and to the truth; but they generally\noccupy a position where constant labor must be bestowed uponthem,\nor they will become of the world themselves. They are a source of\nconstant anxiety and heartache. Tears flow on their account, and\nagonizing prayers are wrung from the hearts of parents in their\nbehalf. Yet they move on, reckless of the pain which their course of\naction causes. They plant thorns in the breasts of those who would\ndie to save them and have them become what God designed they\nshould through the merits of the blood of Christ.\nThe youth exercise their ability to execute this or that nice piece [513]\nof art, but do not feel that God requires them to turn their talents to a\nbetter account, that of adorning their profession and seeking to save\nsouls for whom Christ died. One such soul saved is of more value\nthan worlds. Gold and earthly treasure can bear no comparison to\nthe salvation of even one poor soul.\nYoung men and young women, I saw that God has a work for\nyou to do; take up your cross and follow Christ, or you are unworthy\nof Him. While you remain in listless indifference, how can you tell\nwhat is the will of God concerning you? and how do you expect\nto be saved, unless as faithful servants you do your Lord\u2019s will?\nThose who possess eternal life will all have done well. The King of\nglory will exalt them to His right hand while He says to them: \u201cWell\n482 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndone, good and faithful servants.\u201d How can you tell how many souls\nyou might save from ruin if, instead of studying your own pleasure,\nyou were seeking what work you could do in the vineyard of your\nMaster? How many souls have these gatherings for conversation and\nthe practice of music been the means of saving? If you cannot point\nto one soul thus saved, turn, oh, turn to a new course of action. Begin\nto pray for souls; come near to Christ, close to His bleeding side.\nLet a meek and quiet spirit adorn your lives, and let your earnest,\nbroken, humble petitions ascend to Him for wisdom that you may\nhave success in saving not only your own soul, but the souls of\nothers. Pray more than you sing. Do you not stand in greater need\nof prayer than of singing? Young men and women, God calls upon\nyou to work, work for Him. Make an entire change in your course\nof action. You can do work that those who minister in word and\ndoctrine cannot do. You can reach a class whom the minister cannot\naffect.\nChapter 87\u2014Recreation for Christians [514]\nI was shown that Sabbathkeepers as a people labor too hard\nwithout allowing themselves change or periods of rest. Recreation\nis needful to those who are engaged in physical labor and is still\nmore essential for those whose labor is principally mental. It is\nnot essential to our salvation, nor for the glory of God, to keep\nthe mind laboring constantly and excessively, even upon religious\nthemes. There are amusements, such as dancing, card playing, chess,\ncheckers, etc., which we cannot approve, because Heaven condemns\nthem. These amusements open the door for great evil. They are not\nbeneficial in their tendency, but have an exciting influence, producing\nin some minds a passion for those plays which lead to gambling and\ndissipation. All such plays should be condemned by Christians, and\nsomething perfectly harmless should be substituted in their place.\nI saw that our holidays should not be spent in patterning after\nthe world, yet they should not be passed by unnoticed, for this will\nbring dissatisfaction to our children. On these days when there\nis danger that our children will be exposed to evil influences, and\nbecome corrupted by the pleasures and excitement of the world,\nlet the parents study to get up something to take the place of more\ndangerous amusements. Give your children to understand that you\nhave their good and happiness in view.\nLet several families living in a city or village unite and leave the\noccupations which have taxed them physically and mentally, and\nmake an excursion into the country to the side of a fine lake or to\na nice grove where the scenery of nature is beautiful. They should\nprovide themselves with plain, hygienic food, the very best fruits\nand grains, and spread their table under the shade of some tree or\nunder the canopy of heaven. The ride, the exercise, and the scenery\nwill quicken the appetite, and they can enjoy a repast which kings\nmight envy.\nOn such occasions parents and children should feel free from [515]\ncare, labor, and perplexity. Parents should become children with\n483\n484 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ntheir children, making everything as pleasant for them as possible.\nLet the whole day be given to recreation. Exercise in the open air\nfor those whose employment has been withindoors and sedentary\nwill be beneficial to health. All who can, should feel it a duty to\npursue this course. Nothing will be lost, but much gained. They can\nreturn to their occupations with new life and new courage to engage\nin their labor with zeal, and they are better prepared to resist disease.\nI saw that but few realize the constant, wearing labor of those\nwho are bearing the responsibilities of the work in the office. They\nare confined withindoors day after day and week after week, while a\nconstant strain upon the mental powers is surely undermining their\nconstitutions and lessening their hold on life. These brethren are in\ndanger of breaking suddenly. They are not immortal, and without a\nchange they must wear out and be lost to the work.\nWe have precious gifts in Brethren A, B, and C. We cannot\nafford to have them ruin their health through close confinement\nand incessant toil. Where can we find men with their experience\nto supply their places? Two of these brethren have been fourteen\nyears connected with the work in the office, laboring earnestly,\nconscientiously, and unselfishly for the advancement of the cause\nof God. They have had scarcely any variation except what fevers\nand other sickness have given them. They should have a change\nfrequently, should often devote a day wholly to recreation with their\nfamilies, who are almost entirely deprived of their society. All may\nnot be able to leave the work at the same time; but they should\nso arrange their work that one or two may go, leaving others to\nsupply their places, and then let these in their turn have the same\nopportunity.\nI saw that these brethren, A, B, and C, should as a religious\nduty take care of the health and strength which God has given them.[516]\nThe Lord does not require them just now to become martyrs to His\ncause. They will obtain no reward for making this sacrifice, for God\nwants them to live. They can serve the cause of present truth far\nbetter by their lives than by their death. If any one of these brethren\nshould be suddenly prostrated by disease, no one should regard it as\na direct judgment from the Lord. It will be only the sure result of\nthe violation of nature\u2019s laws. They should take heed to the warning\ngiven, lest they transgress and have to suffer the heavy penalty.\nRecreation for Christians 485\nI saw that these brethren could benefit the cause of God by\nattending, as often as practicable, convocation meetings at a distance\nfrom their place of labor. The work committed to them is important,\nand they need healthy nerves and brains; but it is impossible for their\nminds to be enlivened and invigorated as God would have them,\nwhile they are incessantly confined at the office. I was shown that\nit would be a benefit to the cause at large for these men, standing\nat the head of the work at Battle Creek, to become acquainted with\ntheir brethren abroad by associating with them in meeting. It will\ngive the brethren abroad confidence in those who are bearing the\nresponsibilities of the work, and will relieve these brethren of the\ntaxation upon the brain, and will make them better acquainted with\nthe progress of the work and the wants of the cause. It will enliven\ntheir hope, renew their faith, and increase their courage. Time thus\ntaken will not be lost, but will be spent to the very best advantage.\nThese brethren have qualities which render them in the highest\ndegree capable of enjoying social life. They would enjoy their stay\nat the homes of brethren abroad, and would benefit and be benefited\nby interchange of thought and views.\nEspecially do I appeal to Brother C to change his course of life.\nHe cannot exercise as others in the office can. Indoor, sedentary\nemployment is preparing him for a sudden breakdown. He cannot [517]\nalways do as he has done. He must spend more time in the open air,\nhaving periods of light labor of some special nature, or exercise of a\npleasant, recreative character. Such confinement as he has imposed\nupon himself would break down the constitution of the strongest\nanimal. It is cruel, it is wicked, a sin against himself, against which\nI raise my voice in warning. Brother C, more of your time must be\nspent in the open air, in riding or in pleasant exercise, or you must\ndie, your wife become a widow, and your children, who love you so\nmuch, become orphans. Brother C is qualified to edify others in the\nexposition of the word. He can serve the cause of God and benefit\nhimself by going out to the large gatherings of Sabbathkeepers and\nbearing his testimony for the edification of those who are privileged\nto hear him. This change would bring him more out of doors, into\nthe open air. His blood flows sluggishly through his veins for want\nof the vivifying air of heaven. He has done well his part in the work\nat the office, but still he has needed the electrifying influence of pure\n486 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nair and sunlight out of doors to make his work still more spiritual\nand enlivening.\nJune 5, 1863, I was shown that my husband should preserve his\nstrength and health, for God had yet a great work for us to do. In His\nprovidence we had obtained an experience in this work from its very\ncommencement, and thus our labors would be of greater account\nto His cause. I saw that my husband\u2019s constant and excessive labor\nwas exhausting his fund of strength, which God would have him\npreserve; that if he continued to overtask his physical and mental\nenergies as he had been doing, he would be using up his future\nresources of strength and exhausting the capital, and would break\ndown prematurely, and the cause of God would be deprived of his\nlabor. Much of the time he was performing labor connected with the\noffice which others might do, or was engaged in business transactions\nwhich he should avoid. God would have us both reserve our strength[518]\nto be used when specially required to do that work which others\ncould not do, and for which He has raised us up, preserved our lives,\nand given us a valuable experience; in this way we could be a benefit\nto His people.\nI did not make this public, because it was given specially to us.\nIf this caution had been fully heeded, the affliction under which\nmy husband has been so great a sufferer would have been saved.\nThe work of God was urgent and seemed to allow of no relaxation\nor separation from it. My husband seemed compelled to constant,\nwearing labor. Anxiety for his brethren liable to the draft, and also\nconcerning the rebellion in Iowa, kept his mind continually strained,\nand the physical energies were utterly exhausted. Instead of his\nhaving relief, burdens never pressed heavier; and care, instead of\nlessening, was trebled. But there certainly was a way of escape, or\nGod would not have given the caution He did and would not have\npermitted him to break down under the taxation. I saw that had\nhe not been specially sustained by God he would have realized the\nprostration of his physical and mental powers much sooner than he\ndid.\nWhen God speaks, He means what He says. When He cautions,\nit becomes those noticed to take heed. The reason why I now speak\npublicly is that the same caution which was given to my husband has\nbeen given to others connected with the office. I saw that unless they\nRecreation for Christians 487\nchange their course of action, they are just as liable to be stricken\ndown as was my husband. I am not willing that others should suffer\nas he has done. But that which is most to be dreaded is, they would\nbe lost for a time to the cause and work of God, when the help and\ninfluence of all are so much needed.\nThose connected with the office cannot endure the amount of\ncare and labor that my husband has borne for years. They have not\nthe constitution, the capital to draw upon, which my husband had.\nThey can never endure the perplexities and the constant, wearing [519]\nlabor which have come upon him and which he has borne for twenty\nyears. I cannot endure the thought that any in the office should\nsacrifice strength and health through excessive labor, so that their\nusefulness should prematurely end and they be unable to work in\nthe vineyard of the Lord. It is not merely the gatherers of the fruit\nthat are the essential laborers; all who assist in digging about the\nplants, watering, pruning, and lifting up the drooping, trailing vines,\nand leading their tendrils to entwine about the true trellis, the sure\nsupport, are workmen who cannot be spared.\nThe brethren in the office feel that they cannot leave the work for\na few days for a change, for recreation; but this is a mistake. They\ncan and should do so. Even if there were not as much accomplished,\nit would be better to leave for a few days than to be prostrated by\ndisease and be separated from the work for months, and perhaps\nnever be able to engage in it again.\nMy husband thought it wrong for him to spend time in social\nenjoyment. He could not afford to rest. He thought that the work in\nthe office would suffer if he should. But after the blow fell upon him,\ncausing physical and mental prostration, the work had to be carried\non without him. I saw that the brethren engaged in the responsible\nlabor in the office should work upon a different plan and make their\narrangements to have change. If more help is needed, obtain it, and\nlet relief come to those who are suffering from constant confinement\nand brain labor. They should attend convocation meetings. They\nneed to throw off care, share the hospitality of their brethren, and\nenjoy their society and the blessings of the meetings. They will thus\nreceive fresh thoughts, and their wearied energies will be awakened\nto new life, and they will return to the work far better qualified to\n488 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nperform their part, for they will better understand the wants of the\ncause.\nBrethren abroad, are you asleep to this matter? Must your hearts[520]\nbe made faint by the fall of another of God\u2019s workmen, whom you\nlove? These men are the property of the church. Will you suffer them\nto die under the burdens? I appeal to you to advise a different order\nof things. I pray God that the bitter experience that has come upon us\nmay never be allowed to come to any one of the brethren in the office.\nEspecially do I commend Brother C to your care. Shall he die for\nwant of air, the vitalizing air of heaven? The course he is pursuing is\nreally shortening his life. Through his confinement indoors his blood\nis becoming foul and sluggish, the liver is deranged, the action of the\nheart is not right. Unless he works a change for himself, nature will\ntake the work into her own hands. She will make a grand attempt to\nrelieve the system by expelling the impurities from the blood. She\nwill summon all the vital powers to work, and the whole organism\nwill be deranged, and all this may end in paralysis or apoplexy. If he\nshould ever recover from this crisis, his loss of time would be great;\nbut the probabilities of recovery are very small. If Brother C cannot\nbe aroused, I advise you, brethren, who have an interest in the cause\nof present truth, to take him, as Luther was taken by his friends, and\ncarry him away from his work.\nSince writing the above, I learn that most of Thoughts on the\nRevelation, was written in the night, after the author\u2019s day\u2019s work\nwas done. This was the course which my husband pursued; I protest\nagainst such suicide. The brethren whom I have mentioned, who\nare so closely confined in the office, would be serving the cause of\nGod by attending meetings and taking periods of recreation. They\nwould be preserving physical health and mental strength in the best\ncondition to devote to the work. They should not be left to feel\ncrippled because they are not earning wages. Their wages should go\non and they be free. They are doing a great work.\nChapter 88\u2014The Reform Dress [521]\nIn answer to letters of inquiry from many sisters relative to the\nproper length of the reform dress, I would say that in our part of\nthe State of Michigan we have adopted the uniform length of about\nnine inches from the floor. I take this opportunity to answer these\ninquiries in order to save the time required to answer so many letters.\nI should have spoken before, but have waited to see something\ndefinite on this point in the Health Reformer. I would earnestly\nrecommend uniformity in length, and would say that nine inches as\nnearly accords with my views of the matter as I am able to express\nit in inches.\nAs I travel from place to place I find that the reform dress is\nnot rightly represented, and am made to feel that something more\ndefinite should be said that there may be uniform action in this\nmatter. This style of dress is unpopular, and for this reason neatness\nand taste should be exercised by those who adopt it. I have spoken\nonce upon this point, yet some fail to follow the advice given. There\nshould be uniformity as to the length of the reform dress among\nSabbathkeepers. Those who make themselves peculiar by adopting\nthis dress should not think for a moment that it is unnecessary to\nshow order, taste, and neatness. Before putting on the reform dress,\nour sisters should obtain patterns of the pants and sack worn with\nit. It is a great injury to the dress reform to have persons introduce\ninto a community a style which in every particular needs reforming\nbefore it can rightly represent the reform dress. Wait, sisters, till you\ncan put the dress on right.\nIn some places there is great opposition to the short dress. But\nwhen I see some dresses worn by the sisters, I do not wonder that\npeople are disgusted and condemn the dress. Where the dress is\nrepresented as it should be, all candid persons are constrained to\nadmit that it is modest and convenient. In some of our churches I\nhave seen all kinds of reform dresses, and yet not one answering the [522]\ndescription presented before me. Some appear with white muslin\n489\n490 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\npants, white sleeves, dark delaine dress, and a sleeveless sack of the\nsame description as the dress. Some have a calico dress with pants\ncut after their own fashioning, not after \u201cthe pattern,\u201d without starch\nor stiffening to give them form, and clinging close to the limbs.\nThere is certainly nothing in these dresses manifesting taste or order.\nSuch a dress would not recommend itself to the good judgment of\nsensible-minded persons. In every sense of the word it is a deformed\ndress.\nSisters who have opposing husbands have asked my advice in\nregard to their adopting the short dress contrary to the wishes of\nthe husband. I advise them to wait. I do not consider the dress\nquestion of so vital importance as the Sabbath. Concerning the\nlatter there can be no hesitation. But the opposition which many\nmight receive should they adopt the dress reform would be more\ninjurious to health than the dress would be beneficial. Several of\nthese sisters have said to me: \u201cMy husband likes your dress; he says\nhe has not one word of fault to find with it.\u201d This has led me to see\nthe necessity of our sisters\u2019 representing the dress reform aright, by\nmanifesting neatness, order, and uniformity in dress. I shall have\npatterns prepared to take with me as we travel, ready to hand to our\nsisters whom we shall meet, or to send by mail to all who may order\nthem. Our address will be given in the Review.\nThose who adopt the short dress should manifest taste in the\nselection of colors. Those who are unable to buy new cloth must\ndo the best they can to exercise taste and ingenuity in fixing over\nold garments, making them new again. Be particular to have the\npants and dress of the same color and material, or you will appear\nfantastic. Old garments may be cut after a correct pattern and ar-\nranged tastefully, and appear like new. I beg of you, sisters, not to\nform your patterns after your own particular ideas. While there are\ncorrect patterns and good tastes, there are also incorrect patterns and[523]\nbad tastes.\nThis dress does not require hoops, and I hope that it will never be\ndisgraced by them. Our sisters need not wear many skirts to distend\nthe dress. It appears much more becoming falling about the form\nnaturally over one or two light skirts. Moreen is excellent material\nfor outside skirts; it retains its stiffness and is durable. If anything\nis worn in skirts, let it be very small. Quilts are unnecessary. Yet\nReform Dress 491\nI frequently see them worn, and sometimes hanging a trifle below\nthe dress. This gives it an immodest, untidy appearance. White\nskirts, worn with dark dresses, do not become the short dress. Be\nparticular to have your skirts clean, neat, and nice; make them of\ngood material and in all cases at least three inches shorter than the\ndress. If anything is worn to distend the skirt, let it be small and at\nleast one quarter or one half a yard from the bottom of the dress or\noutside skirt. If a cord, or anything answering the place of cords, is\nplaced directly around the bottom of the skirt, it distends the dress\nmerely at the bottom, making it appear very unbecoming when the\nwearer is sitting or stooping.\nNone need fear that I shall make dress reform one of my principal\nsubjects as we travel from place to place. Those who have heard me\nupon this matter will have to act upon the light that has already been\ngiven. I have done my duty; I have borne my testimony, and those\nwho have heard me and read that which I have written must now\nbear the responsibility of receiving or rejecting the light given. If\nthey choose to venture to be forgetful hearers, and not doers of the\nwork, they run their own risk and will be accountable to God for the\ncourse they pursue. I am clear. I shall urge none and condemn none.\nThis is not the work assigned me. God knows His humble, willing,\nobedient children and will reward them according to their faithful\nperformance of His will. To many the dress reform is too simple\nand humbling to be adopted. They cannot lift the cross. God works [524]\nby simple means to separate and distinguish His children from the\nworld; but some have so departed from the simplicity of the work\nand ways of God that they are above the work, not in it.\nI was referred to Numbers 15:38-41: \u201cSpeak unto the children\nof Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders\nof their garments throughout their generations, and that they put\nupon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: and it shall be\nunto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all\nthe commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye seek not\nafter your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go\na whoring: that ye may remember, and do all My commandments,\nand be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, which brought\nyou out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord your\nGod.\u201d Here God expressly commanded a very simple arrangement\n492 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof dress for the children of Israel for the purpose of distinguishing\nthem from the idolatrous nations around them. As they looked upon\ntheir peculiarity of dress, they were to remember that they were\nGod\u2019s commandment-keeping people, and that He had wrought in a\nmiraculous manner to bring them from Egyptian bondage to serve\nHim, to be a holy people unto Him. They were not to serve their\nown desires, or to imitate the idolatrous nations around them, but to\nremain a distinct, separate people, that all who looked upon them\nmight say: These are they whom God brought out of the land of\nEgypt, who keep the law of Ten Commandments. An Israelite was\nknown to be such as soon as seen, for God through simple means\ndistinguished him as His.\nThe order given by God to the children of Israel to place a ribbon\nof blue in their garments was to have no direct influence on their\nhealth, only as God would bless them by obedience, and the ribbon\nwould keep in their memory the high claims of Jehovah and prevent\nthem from mingling with other nations, uniting in their drunken\nfeasts, and eating swine\u2019s flesh and luxurious food detrimental to[525]\nhealth. God would now have His people adopt the reform dress, not\nonly to distinguish them from the world as His \u201cpeculiar people,\u201d\nbut because a reform in dress is essential to physical and mental\nhealth. God\u2019s people have, to a great extent, lost their peculiarity,\nand have been gradually patterning after the world, and mingling\nwith them, until they have in many respects become like them. This\nis displeasing to God. He directs them, as He directed the children\nof Israel anciently, to come out from the world and forsake their\nidolatrous practices, not following their own hearts (for their hearts\nare unsanctified) or their own eyes, which have led them to depart\nfrom God and to unite with the world.\nSomething must arise to lessen the hold of God\u2019s people upon\nthe world. The reform dress is simple and healthful, yet there is a\ncross in it. I thank God for the cross and cheerfully bow to lift it.\nWe have been so united with the world that we have lost sight of the\ncross and do not suffer for Christ\u2019s sake.\nWe should not wish to invent something to make a cross; but\nif God presents to us a cross, we should cheerfully bear it. In the\nacceptance of the cross we are distinguished from the world, who\nlove us not and ridicule our peculiarity. Christ was hated by the\nReform Dress 493\nworld because He was not of the world. Can His followers expect\nto fare better than their Master? If we pass along without receiving\ncensure or frowns from the world we may be alarmed, for it is our\nconformity to the world which makes us so much like them that\nthere is nothing to arouse their envy or malice; there is no collision\nof spirits. The world despises the cross. \u201cFor the preaching of the\ncross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved\nit is the power of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 1:18. \u201cBut God forbid that I\nshould glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom\nthe world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.\u201d Galatians 6:14.\n[See Appendix.]\nChapter 89\u2014Surmisings About Battle Creek[526]\nIn 1865 I saw that some have felt at liberty, through envious\nfeelings, to speak lightly of the church at Battle Creek. Some look\nsuspiciously on all that is going on there and seem to exult if they\ncan get hold of anything to take advantage of to the discredit of\nBattle Creek. God is displeased with such a spirit and course of\naction. From what source do our churches abroad obtain their light\nand knowledge of the truth? It has been from the means which\nGod has ordained, which center at Battle Creek. Who have the\nburdens of the cause? It is those who are zealously laboring at\nBattle Creek. Burdens and heavy trials necessarily come upon those\nwho stand in the forefront of the hottest battle, and perplexities\nand wearing thought are attendant upon all who engage in making\nhighly important decisions in connection with the work of God. Our\nbrethren abroad, who are relieved from all this, should feel thankful\nand praise God that they are thus favored and should be the last to\nbe jealous, envious, and faultfinding, occupying a position, \u201cReport,\nand we will report it.\u201d\nThe church at Battle Creek have borne the burdens of the Confer-\nences, which have been a severe tax upon nearly all. In consequence\nof the extra labor many have brought upon themselves debility which\nhas lasted for many months. They have borne the burden cheerfully,\nbut have felt saddened and disheartened by the heartless indifference\nof some and the cruel jealousy of others after they returned to the\nseveral churches whence they came. Remarks are thoughtlessly\nmade\u2014by some designedly, by others carelessly\u2014concerning the\nburden bearers there and concerning those who stand at the head of\nthe work. God has marked all these speeches and the jealousy and\nenvy which prompted them; a faithful record is kept. Many thank[527]\nGod for the truth and then turn around and question and find fault\nwith the very means which Heaven has ordained to make them what\nthey are or what they ought to be. How much more pleasing to God\nit would be for them to act the part of Aaron and Hur and help hold\n494\nSurmisings About Battle Creek 495\nup the hands of those who are bearing the great and heavy burdens\nof the work in connection with the cause of God. Murmurers and\ncomplainers should remain at home, where they will be out of the\nway of temptation, where they cannot find food for their jealousies,\nevil surmisings, and faultfindings, for the presence of such is only a\nburden to the meetings; they are clouds without water.\nThose who feel at liberty to find fault with and censure those\nwhom God has chosen to act an important part in this last great\nwork would better seek to be converted and to obtain the mind of\nChrist. Let them remember the children of Israel who were so ready\nto find fault with Moses, whom God had ordained to lead His people\nto Canaan, and to murmur against even God Himself. All these\nmurmurers fell in the wilderness. It is easy to rebel, easy to give\nbattle before considering matters rationally, calmly, and settling\nwhether there is anything to war against. The children of Israel are\nan example to us upon whom the ends of the world are come.\nIt is easier for many to question and find fault in regard to matters\nat Battle Creek than to tell what should be done. Some would\neven venture to take this responsibility, but they would soon find\nthemselves deficient in experience and would run the work into the\nground. If these talkers and faultfinders would themselves become\nburden bearers and pray for the laborers, they would be blessed\nthemselves and would bless others with their godly example, with\ntheir holy influence and lives. It is easier for many to talk than to\npray; such lack spirituality and holiness, and their influence is an\ninjury to the cause of God. Instead of feeling that the work at Battle [528]\nCreek is their work, and that they have an interest in its prosperity,\nthey stand aside more as spectators, to question and find fault. Those\nwho do this are the very ones who lack experience in this work and\nwho have suffered but little for the truth\u2019s sake.\n* * * * *\nChapter 90\u2014Shifting Responsibilities\nThose Sabbathkeeping brethren who shift the responsibility of\ntheir stewardship into the hands of their wives, while they themselves\nare capable of managing the same, are unwise and in the transfer\ndisplease God. The stewardship of the husband cannot be transferred\nto the wife. Yet this is sometimes attempted, to the great injury of\nboth. A believing husband has sometimes transferred his property\nto his unbelieving companion, hoping thereby to gratify her, disarm\nher opposition, and finally induce her to believe the truth. But this is\nno more nor less than an attempt to purchase peace, or to hire the\nwife to believe the truth. The means which God has lent to advance\nHis cause the husband transfers to one who has no sympathy for\nthe truth; what account will such a steward render when the great\nMaster requires His own with usury?\nBelieving parents have frequently transferred their property to\ntheir unbelieving children, thus putting it out of their power to render\nto God the things that are His. By so doing they lay off that responsi-\nbility which God has laid upon them, and place in the enemy\u2019s ranks\nmeans which God has entrusted to them to be returned to Him by\nbeing invested in His cause when He shall require it of them. It is not\nin God\u2019s order that parents who are capable of managing their own\nbusiness should give up the control of their property, even to children[529]\nwho are of the same faith. These seldom possess as much devotion\nto the cause as they should, and they have not been schooled in ad-\nversity and affliction so as to place a high estimate upon the eternal\ntreasure and less upon the earthly. The means placed in the hands\nof such is the greatest evil. It is a temptation to them to place their\naffections upon the earthly and trust to property and feel that they\nneed but little besides. When means which they have not acquired\nby their own exertion comes into their possession, they seldom use\nit wisely.\nThe husband who transfers his property to his wife opens for her\na wide door of temptation, whether she is a believer or an unbeliever.\n496\nShifting Responsibilities 497\nIf she is a believer and naturally penurious, inclined to selfishness\nand acquisitiveness, the battle will be much harder for her with\nher husband\u2019s stewardship and her own to manage. In order to be\nsaved, she must overcome all these peculiar, evil traits and imitate\nthe character of her divine Lord, seeking opportunity to do others\ngood, loving others as Christ has loved us. She should cultivate the\nprecious gift of love possessed so largely by our Saviour. His life\nwas characterized by noble, disinterested benevolence. His whole\nlife was not marred by one selfish act.\nWhatever the motives of the husband, he has placed a terrible\nstumbling block in his wife\u2019s way to hinder her in the work of\novercoming. And if the transfer be made to the children, the same\nevil results may follow. God reads his motives. If he is selfish\nand has made the transfer to conceal his covetousness and excuse\nhimself from doing anything to advance the cause, the curse of\nHeaven will surely follow. God reads the purposes and intents of\nthe heart, and tries the motives of the children of men. His signal,\nvisible displeasure may not be manifested as in the case of Ananias\nand Sapphira, yet in the end the punishment will in no case be lighter\nthan that which was inflicted upon them. In trying to deceive men, [530]\nthey were lying to God. \u201cThe soul that sinneth, it shall die.\u201d\nSuch can stand the test of the judgment no better than the man\nwho received the one talent and hid it in the earth. When called to\naccount, he accused God of injustice: \u201cI knew Thee that Thou art an\nhard man, reaping where Thou hast not sown, and gathering where\nThou hast not strewed: and I was afraid, and went and hid Thy talent\nin the earth [where the cause of God could not be benefited with it]:\nlo, there Thou hast that is Thine.\u201d Saith God: \u201cTake therefore the\ntalent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.... And\ncast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be\nweeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d This man was afraid that his Lord\nwould be benefited by the improvement of his talent.\nI saw that there are many who have wrapped their talent in\na napkin and hid it in the earth. They seem to think that every\npenny which is invested in the cause of God is lost to them beyond\nredemption. To those who feel thus, it is even so. They will receive\nno reward. They give grudgingly only because they feel obliged\nto do something. God loveth the cheerful giver. Those who flatter\n498 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthemselves that they can shift their responsibility upon the wife or\nchildren are deceived by the enemy. A transfer of property will\nnot lessen their responsibility. They are accountable for the means\nwhich Heaven has entrusted to their care, and in no way can they\nexcuse themselves from this responsibility until they are released by\nrendering back to God that which He has committed to them.\nThe love of the world separates from God. \u201cIf any man love the\nworld, the love of the Father is not in him.\u201d It is impossible for any\nto discern the truth while the world has their affections. The world\ncomes between them and God, beclouding the vision and benumbing\nthe sensibilities to such a degree that it is impossible for them to\ndiscern sacred things. God calls upon such: \u201cCleanse your hands,[531]\nye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double-minded. Be afflicted,\nand mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and\nyour joy to heaviness.\u201d Those who have stained their hands with\nthe pollution of the world are required to cleanse themselves from\nits stains. Those who think they can serve the world and yet love\nGod are double-minded. But they cannot serve God and mammon.\nThey are men of two minds, loving the world and losing all sense of\ntheir obligation to God, and yet professing to be Christ\u2019s followers.\nThey are neither the one thing nor the other. They will lose both\nworlds unless they cleanse their hands and purify their hearts through\nobedience to the pure principles of truth. \u201cHe that saith he abideth\nin Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.\u201d \u201cHerein\nis our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of\njudgment: because as He is, so are we in this world.\u201d \u201cWhereby\nare given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by\nthese ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust.\u201d\nIt is worldly lust that is destroying true godliness. Love of the\nworld and the things that are in the world is separating from the\nFather. The passion for earthly gain is increasing among those who\nprofess to be looking for the soon appearing of our Saviour. The\nlust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life control even\nprofessed Christians. They are seeking for the things of the world\nwith avaricious lust, and many will sell eternal life for unholy gain.\n* * * * *\nChapter 91\u2014Proper Observance of the Sabbath\nDecember 25, 1865, I was shown that there has been too much\nslackness in regard to the observance of the Sabbath. There has not\nbeen promptness to fulfill the secular duties within the six working [532]\ndays which God has given to man and carefulness not to infringe\nupon one hour of the holy, sacred time which He has reserved to\nHimself. There is no business of man\u2019s that should be considered of\nsufficient importance to cause him to transgress the fourth precept\nof Jehovah. There are cases in which Christ has given permission to\nlabor even on the Sabbath in saving the life of men or of animals.\nBut if we violate the letter of the fourth commandment for our own\nadvantage from a pecuniary point of view we become Sabbathbreak-\ners and are guilty of transgressing all the commandments, for if we\noffend in one point we are guilty of all. If in order to save prop-\nerty we break over the express command of Jehovah, where is the\nstopping place? Where shall we set the bounds? Transgress in a\nsmall matter, and look upon it as no particular sin on our part, and\nthe conscience becomes hardened, the sensibilities blunted, until\nwe can go still further and perform quite an amount of labor and\nstill flatter ourselves that we are Sabbathkeepers, when, according to\nChrist\u2019s standard, we are breaking every one of God\u2019s holy precepts.\nThere is a fault with Sabbathkeepers in this respect; but God is very\nparticular, and all who think that they are saving a little time, or\nadvantaging themselves by infringing a little on the Lord\u2019s time, will\nmeet with loss sooner or later. He cannot bless them as it would be\nHis pleasure to do, for His name is dishonored by them, His precepts\nlightly esteemed. God\u2019s curse will rest upon them, and they will lose\nten or twentyfold more than they gain. \u201cWill a man rob God? Yet ye\nhave robbed Me, ... even this whole nation.\u201d\nGod has given man six days in which to work for himself, but\nHe has reserved one day in which He is to be specially honored.\nHe is to be glorified, His authority respected. And yet man will rob\nGod by stealing a little of the time which the Creator has reserved\n499\n500 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfor Himself. God reserved the seventh day as a period of rest for\nman, for the good of man as well as for His own glory. He saw that\nthe wants of man required a day of rest from toil and care, that his[533]\nhealth and life would be endangered without a period of relaxation\nfrom the labor and anxiety of the six days.\nThe Sabbath was made for the benefit of man; and to knowingly\ntransgress the holy commandment forbidding labor upon the seventh\nday is a crime in the sight of heaven which was of such magnitude\nunder the Mosaic law as to require the death of the offender. But\nthis was not all that the offender was to suffer, for God would not\ntake a transgressor of His law to heaven. He must suffer the second\ndeath, which is the full and final penalty for the transgressor of the\nlaw of God.\n* * * * *\nChapter 92\u2014Political Sentiments\nAt Rochester, New York, December 25, 1865, I was shown many\nthings concerning the people of God in connection with His work for\nthese last days. I saw that many professed Sabbathkeepers will come\nshort of everlasting life. They fail to take warning from the course\npursued by the children of Israel and fall into some of their evil ways.\nIf they continue in these sins they will fall like the Israelites and\nnever enter the heavenly Canaan. \u201cNow all these things happened\nunto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition,\nupon whom the ends of the world are come.\u201d\nI saw that many would fall this side of the kingdom. God is\ntesting and proving His people, and many will not endure the test\nof character, the measurement of God. Many will have close work\nto overcome their peculiar traits of character and be without spot\nor wrinkle or any such thing, unrebukable before God and man.\nMany professed Sabbathkeepers will be no special benefit to the\ncause of God or the church without a thorough reformation on their\npart. Many Sabbathkeepers are not right before God in their political\nviews. They are not in harmony with God\u2019s word or in union with [534]\nthe body of Sabbathkeeping believers. Their views do not accord\nwith the principles of our faith. Sufficient light has been given to\ncorrect all who wish to be corrected. All who still retain political\nsentiments which are not in accordance with the spirit of truth are\nliving in violation of the principles of heaven. Therefore as long\nas they thus remain they cannot possess the spirit of freedom and\nholiness.\nTheir principles and positions in political matters are a great\nhindrance to their spiritual advancement. These are a constant snare\nto them and a reproach to our faith, and those who retain these\nprinciples will eventually be brought just where the enemy would\nbe glad to have them, where they will be finally separated from\nSabbathkeeping Christians. These brethren cannot receive the ap-\nproval of God while they lack sympathy for the oppressed colored\n501\n502 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nrace and are at variance with the pure, republican principles of our\nGovernment. God has no more sympathy with rebellion upon earth\nthan with the rebellion in heaven, when the great rebel questioned\nthe foundation of God\u2019s government and was thrust out with all who\nsympathized with him in his rebellion.\n* * * * *\nChapter 93\u2014Usury\nIn the view given me in Rochester, New York, December 25,\n1865, I was shown that the subject of taking usury should be consid-\nered by Sabbathkeepers. Wealthy men have no right to take interest\nfrom their poor brethren, but they may receive usury from unbeliev-\ners. \u201cAnd if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee;\nthen thou shalt relieve him.... Take thou no usury of him, or increase:\nbut fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. Thou shalt\nnot give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for\nincrease.\u201d \u201cThou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of [535]\nmoney, usury of victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury:\nunto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother\nthou shalt not lend upon usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee\nin all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to\npossess it.\u201d\nGod has been displeased with Sabbathkeepers for their avaricious\nspirit. Their desire to get gain is so strong that they have taken\nadvantage of poor, unfortunate brethren in their distress and have\nadded to their own already abundant means, while these poorer\nbrethren have suffered for the same means. \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s\nkeeper?\u201d is the language of their hearts.\nA few years ago some of the poorer brethren were in danger of\nlosing their souls through wrong impressions. Everywhere Satan was\ntempting them in regard to the wealthy. These poor brethren were\nconstantly expecting to be favored, when it was their duty to rely\nupon their own energies; and had they been favored, it would have\nbeen the worst thing that could have been done for them. All through\nthe ranks of Sabbathkeepers, Satan was seeking to overthrow the\npoorer class by his temptations. Some who have lacked judgment\nand wisdom have taken their own course, being unwilling to ask\nadvice or to follow it. Such have had to suffer as the result of their\nmiserable calculation, and yet these same ones would feel that they\nshould be favored by their brethren who have property. These things\n503\n504 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nneeded to be corrected. The first-mentioned class did not realize\nthe responsibilities resting upon the wealthy, nor the perplexity and\ncares they were compelled to have because of their means. All they\ncould see was that these had means to use, while they themselves\nwere cramped for the same. But as a general thing the wealthy have\nregarded all the poor in the same light, when there is a class of poor\nwho are doing the best in their power to glorify God, to do good, to\nlive for the truth. These persons are of solid worth. Their judgment[536]\nis good, their spirit precious in the sight of God; and the amount of\ngood which they accomplish in their unpretending way is tenfold\ngreater than that accomplished by the wealthy, although the latter\nmay give large sums on certain occasions. The rich fail to see and\nrealize the necessity of doing good, of being rich in good works,\nready to distribute, willing to communicate.\n* * * * *\nChapter 94\u2014Deceitfulness of Riches\nSome who profess to believe the truth are lacking in discernment\nand fail to appreciate moral worth. Persons who boast much of their\nfidelity to the cause and talk as though they think they know all that\nis worth knowing, are not humble in heart. They may have money\nand property, and this is sufficient to give them influence with some;\nbut it will not raise them one jot in favor with God. Money has\npower and sways a mighty influence. Excellence of character and\nmoral worth are often overlooked if possessed by the poor man. But\nwhat does God care for money, for property? The cattle upon a\nthousand hills are His. The world and all that is therein are His. The\ninhabitants of the earth are as grasshoppers before Him. Men and\nproperty are but as the small dust of the balance. He is no respecter\nof persons.\nMen of property often look upon their wealth and say: By my\nwisdom have I gotten me this wealth. But who gave them power\nto get wealth? God has bestowed upon them the ability which\nthey possess, but instead of giving Him the glory they take it to\nthemselves. He will prove them and try them, and will bring their\nglorying to the dust; He will remove their strength and scatter their\npossessions. Instead of a blessing they will realize a curse. An act\nof wrong or oppression, a deviation from the right way, should no\nsooner be tolerated in a man who possesses property than in a man [537]\nwho has none. All the riches that the most wealthy ever possessed\nare not of sufficient value to cover the smallest sin before God; they\nwill not be accepted as a ransom for transgression. Repentance, true\nhumility, a broken heart, and a contrite spirit alone will be accepted\nof God. And no man can have true humility before God unless the\nsame is exemplified before others. Nothing less than repentance,\nconfession, and forsaking of sin is acceptable to God.\nMany rich men have obtained their wealth by close deal, by\nadvantaging themselves and disadvantaging their poorer fellow men\nor their brethren; and these very men glory in their shrewdness and\n505\n506 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nkeenness in a bargain. But the curse of God will rest upon every\ndollar thus obtained, and upon the increase of it in their hands. As\nthese things were shown me, I could see the force of our Saviour\u2019s\nwords: \u201cIt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,\nthan for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\u201d Those who\npossess the ability to acquire property need to be constantly on the\nwatch or they will turn their acquisitiveness to bad account and not\nmaintain strict honesty. Thus many fall into temptation, overreach,\nreceive more for a thing than it is worth, and sacrifice the generous,\nbenevolent, noble principles of their manhood for sordid gain.\nI was shown that many who profess to be Sabbathkeepers so\nlove the world and the things that are in the world that they have\nbeen corrupted by its spirit and influence; the divine has disappeared\nfrom their characters and the satanic has crept in, transforming them\nto serve the purposes of Satan, to be instruments of unrighteousness.\nThen in contrast with these men I was shown the industrious, hon-\nest, poor men who stand ready to help those who need help, who\nwould rather suffer themselves to be disadvantaged by their wealthy\nbrethren than to manifest so close and acquisitive a spirit as they\nmanifest; men who esteem a clear conscience and right, even in[538]\nlittle things, of greater value than riches. They are so ready to help\nothers, so willing to do all the good in their power, that they do not\namass wealth; their earthly possessions do not increase. If there is a\nbenevolent object to call forth means or labor, they are the first to be\ninterested in and respond to it, and frequently do far beyond their\nreal ability, and thus deny themselves some needed good, to carry\nout their benevolent purposes.\nBecause these men can boast of but little earthly treasure, they\nmay be looked upon as deficient in ability, in judgment, and in wis-\ndom. They may be counted of no special worth, and their influence\nmay not be esteemed by men; yet how does God regard these poor\nwise men? They are regarded precious in His sight, and, although\nnot increasing their treasure upon earth, they are laying up for them-\nselves an incorruptible treasure in the heavens, and in doing this they\nmanifest a wisdom as far superior to that of the wise, calculating,\nacquisitive professed Christian as the divine and godlike is superior\nto the earthly, carnal, and satanic. It is moral worth that God values.\nA Christian character unblotted with avarice, possessing quietness,\nDeceitfulness of Riches 507\nmeekness, and humility, is more precious in His sight than the most\nfine gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir.\nWealthy men are to be tested more closely than they ever yet\nhave been. If they stand the test and overcome the blemishes upon\ntheir character, and as faithful stewards of Christ render to God the\nthings that are His, it will be said to them: \u201cWell done, good and\nfaithful servant; thou has been faithful over a few things, I will make\nthee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\u201d\nI was then directed to the parable of the unjust steward: \u201cAnd I\nsay unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrigh-\nteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting\nhabitations. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also\nin much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. [539]\nIf therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,\nwho will commit to your trust the true riches? And if ye have not\nbeen faithful in that which is another man\u2019s, who shall give you that\nwhich is your own?\u201d\nIf men fail to render to God that which He has lent them to use\nto His glory, and thus rob Him, they will make an entire failure.\nHe has lent them means which they can improve upon by losing no\nopportunity to do good, and thus they may be constantly laying up\ntreasure in heaven. But if, like the man who had one talent, they hide\nit, fearing that God will get that which their talent gains, they will\nnot only lose the increase which will finally be awarded the faithful\nsteward, but also the principal which God gave them to work upon.\nBecause they have robbed God, they will not have laid up treasure\nin heaven, and they lose their earthly treasure also. They have no\nhabitation on earth, and no Friend in heaven to receive them into the\neverlasting habitation of the righteous.\nChrist declares: \u201cNo man can serve two masters: for either he\nwill hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the\none, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon\u201d\u2014\ncannot serve God and your riches, too. \u201cThe Pharisees also, who\nwere covetous, heard all these things: and they derided Him.\u201d Mark\nthe words of Christ to them: \u201cYe are they which justify yourselves\nbefore men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly\nesteemed among men [which is riches acquired by oppression, by\ndeception, by overreaching, by fraud, or in any other dishonest\n508 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmanner] is abomination in the sight of God.\u201d Then Christ presents\nthe two characters, the rich man who was clothed with purple and\nfine linen, and who fared sumptuously every day, and Lazarus, who\nwas in abject poverty and loathsome to the sight, and who begged\nthe few crumbs which the rich man despised. Our Saviour shows\nHis estimate of the two. Although Lazarus was in so deplorable and[540]\nmean a condition, he had true faith, true moral worth, which God\nsaw, and which He considered of so great value that He took this\npoor, despised sufferer and placed him in the most exalted position,\nwhile the honored and ease-loving man of wealth was thrust out from\nthe presence of God and plunged into misery and woe unutterable.\nGod did not value the riches of this wealthy man, because he had not\ntrue moral worth. His character was worthless. His riches did not\nrecommend him to God nor have any influence to secure His favor.\nBy this parable Christ would teach His disciples not to judge or\nvalue men by their wealth or by the honors which they received of\nothers. Such was the course pursued by the Pharisees, who, while\npossessing both riches and worldly honor, were valueless in the\nsight of God and, more than this, were despised and rejected of\nHim, cast out from His sight as disgusting to Him because there was\nno moral worth or soundness in them. They were corrupt, sinful,\nand abominable in His sight. The poor man, despised by his fellow\nmortals and disgusting to their sight, was valuable in the sight of God\nbecause he possessed moral soundness and worth, thus qualifying\nhim to be introduced into the society of refined, holy angels and to\nbe an heir of God and a joint heir with Christ.\nIn Paul\u2019s charge to Timothy he warns him of a class who will\nnot consent to wholesome words and who place a wrong estimate\non riches. He says: \u201cIf any man teach otherwise, and consent not to\nwholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to\nthe doctrine which is according to godliness; he is proud, knowing\nnothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof\ncometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse disputings\nof men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that\ngain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself. But godliness with\ncontentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world,[541]\nand it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and\nraiment let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall\nDeceitfulness of Riches 509\ninto temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts,\nwhich drown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of\nmoney is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they\nhave erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many\nsorrows. But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow\nafter righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. Fight\nthe good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou\nart also called, and hast professed a good profession before many\nwitnesses.\u201d \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world, that they be\nnot high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God,\nwho giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they\nbe rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;\nlaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time\nto come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\nPaul in this letter to Timothy would impress upon his mind the\nnecessity of giving such instruction as should remove the deception\nwhich so easily steals upon the rich, that because of their riches they\nare superior to those who are in poverty, that because of their ability\nto acquire they are superior in wisdom and judgment\u2014in short, that\ngain is godliness. Here is a fearful deception. How few heed the\ncharge which Paul commissioned Timothy to make to the rich! How\nmany flatter themselves that their acquisitiveness is godliness! Paul\ndeclares, \u201cGodliness with contentment is great gain.\u201d Although rich\npersons may devote their whole lives to the one object of getting\nriches, yet as they brought nothing into the world, they can carry\nnothing out. They must die and leave that which cost them so much\nlabor to obtain. They staked their all, their eternal interest, to obtain\nthis property, and have lost both worlds.\nPaul shows what risks men will run to become rich. But many [542]\nare determined to be rich; this is their study, and in their zeal eternal\nconsiderations are overlooked. They are blinded by Satan and make\nthemselves believe that it is for good purposes they desire this gain;\nthey strain their consciences, deceive themselves, and are constantly\ncoveting riches. Such have erred from the faith and pierced them-\nselves through with many sorrows. They have sacrificed their noble,\nelevated principles, given up their faith for riches, and, if not disap-\npointed in their object, they are disappointed in the happiness which\nthey supposed riches would bring. They are entangled, perplexed\n510 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwith care; they have made themselves slaves to their avarice and\ncompelled their families to the same slavery, and the advantages\nthey reap are \u201cmany sorrows.\u201d \u201cCharge them that are rich in this\nworld, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches,\nbut in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.\u201d Men\nare not to hoard up their riches and take no good of them, depriving\nthemselves of the comforts of life and virtually becoming slaves in\norder to retain or increase their earthly treasure.\nThe apostle Paul shows the only true use for riches, and bids\nTimothy charge the rich to do good, that they be rich in good works,\nready to distribute, willing to communicate; for in so doing they\nare laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the\ntime to come,\u2014referring to the close of time,\u2014that they may lay\nhold on eternal life. The teachings of Paul harmonize perfectly with\nthe words of Christ: \u201cMake to yourselves friends of the mammon\nof unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into\neverlasting habitations.\u201d Godliness with contentment is great gain.\nHere is the true secret of happiness, and real prosperity of soul and\nbody.\nChapter 95\u2014Obedience to the Truth [543]\nDear Brother D,\nI recollect your countenance among several others that were\nshown me in vision in Rochester, New York, December 25, 1865. I\nwas shown that you were upon the background. Your judgment is\nconvinced that we have the truth, but you have not as yet experienced\nits sanctifying influence. You have not followed closely the footsteps\nof our Redeemer, therefore you are unprepared to walk even as He\nwalked. As you listen to the words of truth, your judgment says that\nit is correct, it cannot be gainsaid; but immediately the unsanctified\nheart says: \u201cThese are hard sayings, who can hear them? you would\nbetter give up your efforts to keep pace with the people of God, for\nnew and strange and trying things will be continually arising; you\nwill have to stop sometime, and you may just as well stop now, and\nbetter than to go further.\u201d\nYou cannot consent to profess the truth and not live it; you have\never admired a life consistent with profession. I was shown a book\nin which was written your name with many others. Against your\nname was a black blot. You were looking upon this and saying: \u201cIt\ncan never be effaced.\u201d Jesus held His wounded hand above it and\nsaid: \u201cMy blood alone can efface it. If thou wilt from henceforth\nchoose the path of humble obedience, and rely solely upon the\nmerits of My blood to cover thy past transgressions, I will blot out\nthy transgressions, and cover thy sins. But if you choose the path of\ntransgressors you must reap the transgressor\u2019s reward. The wages of\nsin is death.\u201d\nI saw evil angels surrounding you seeking to divert your mind\nfrom Christ, causing you to look upon God as a God of justice and to\nlose sight of the love, compassion, and mercy of a crucified Saviour\nwho will save to the uttermost all that come unto Him. Said the [544]\nangel: \u201cIf any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus\nChrist the righteous.\u201d\n511\n512 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWhen you are under the pressure of mental anxieties, when\nyou are hearkening to the suggestions of Satan and murmuring and\ncomplaining, a ministering angel is commissioned to bear you the\nsuccor you need and put to shame the language of your unbelieving\nmind. You distrust God; you disbelieve in His power to save to\nthe uttermost. You dishonor God by this cruel unbelief and cause\nyourself much needless suffering. I saw heavenly angels surrounding\nyou, driving back the evil angels, and looking with pity and sorrow\nupon you, and pointing you to heaven, the crown of immortality,\nsaying: \u201cHe that would win must fight.\u201d\nAlthough you have been in doubt and perplexity, you have not\ndared to entirely sever the connecting link between yourself and\nGod\u2019s commandment-keeping people. Yet you have not yielded\nall for the truth\u2019s sake; you have not yielded yourself, your own\nwill. You fear to lay yourself and all that you have upon the altar of\nGod, lest you may be required to yield back to Him some portion\nof that which He has lent you. Heavenly angels are acquainted with\nour words and actions, and even with the thoughts and intents of\nthe heart. You, dear brother, fear that the truth will cost you too\nmuch, but this is one of Satan\u2019s suggestions. Let it take all that you\npossess, and it does not cost too much; the value received, if rightly\nestimated, is an eternal weight of glory. How little is required of us!\nHow small the sacrifice that we can make in comparison with that\nwhich our divine Lord made for us! And yet a spirit of murmuring\ncomes over you because of the cost of everlasting life. You, as well\nas others of your brethren at -----, have had severe conflicts with\nthe great adversary of souls. You have several times nearly yielded\nthe conflict, but the influence of your wife and eldest daughter has\nprevailed. These members of your family would obey the truth with[545]\nthe whole heart could they have your influence to sustain them.\nYour daughters look to you for an example, for they think their\nfather must be right. Their salvation depends much upon the course\nwhich you pursue. If you cease striving for everlasting life, you\nwill exert a powerful influence to carry your children with you, you\nwill bow down the spirit of your faithful wife, crush her hopes, and\nlessen her hold on life. How can you in the judgment meet these to\ntestify that your unfaithfulness proved their ruin?\nObedience to the Truth 513\nI saw that you had several times yielded to the suggestions of\nSatan to cease striving to live out the truth, for the tempter told\nyou that you would fail with the best endeavors you might make,\nthat with all your weakness and failings it was impossible for you\nto maintain a life of devotion. I was shown that your wife and\neldest daughter have been your good angels, to grieve over you, to\nencourage you to resist in a measure the powerful suggestions of\nSatan; and through your love for them you have been induced to try\nagain to fix your trembling faith upon the promises of God. Satan\nis waiting to overthrow you that he may exult over your downfall.\nThose who are trampling underfoot the law of God are strengthened\nby you in their rebellion. It is impossible for you to be strong until\nyou take a decided stand for the truth.\nSystematic benevolence looks to you as needless; you overlook\nthe fact that it originated with God, whose wisdom is unerring. This\nplan He ordained to save confusion, to correct covetousness, avarice,\nselfishness, and idolatry. This system was to cause the burden to rest\nlightly, yet with due weight, upon all. The salvation of man cost a\ndear price, even the life of the Lord of glory, which He freely gave\nto lift man from degradation and to exalt him to become heir of the\nworld. God has so ordained that man shall aid his fellow man in [546]\nthe great work of redemption. He who excuses himself from this,\nwho is unwilling to deny himself that others may become partakers\nwith him of the heavenly benefit, proves himself unworthy of the\nlife to come, unworthy of the heavenly treasure which cost so great\na sacrifice. God wants no unwilling offering, no pressed sacrifice.\nThose who are thoroughly converted and who appreciate the work\nof God will give cheerfully the little required of them, considering it\na privilege to bestow.\nSaid the angel: \u201cAbstain from fleshly lusts which war against\nthe soul.\u201d You have stumbled at the health reform. It appears to you\nto be a needless appendix to the truth. It is not so; it is a part of\nthe truth. Here is a work before you which will come closer and be\nmore trying than anything which has yet been brought to bear upon\nyou. While you hesitate and stand back, failing to lay hold upon the\nblessing which it is your privilege to receive, you suffer loss. You\nare stumbling over the very blessing which Heaven has placed in\nyour path to make your progress less difficult. Satan presents this\n514 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbefore you in the most objectionable light, that you may combat\nthat which would prove the greatest benefit to you, which would be\nfor your physical and spiritual health. Of all men you are one to\nbe benefited by health reform; the truth received on every point in\nthis matter of reform will be of the greatest advantage. You are a\nman whom a spare diet will benefit. You were in danger of being\nstricken down in a moment by paralysis, one half of you becoming\ndead. A denial of appetite is salvation to you, yet you view it as a\ngreat privation.\nThe reason why the youth of the present age are not more re-\nligiously inclined is because of the defect in their education. It is\nnot true love exercised toward children which permits in them the\nindulgence of passion, or allows disobedience of parental laws to\ngo unpunished. \u201cJust as the twig is bent the tree is inclined.\u201d The[547]\nmother should ever have the co-operation of the father in her efforts\nto lay the foundation of a good Christian character in her children.\nA doting father should not close his eyes to the faults of his children\nbecause it is not pleasant to administer correction. You both need to\narouse and with firmness, not in a harsh manner, but with determined\npurpose, let your children know they must obey you.\nA father must not be as a child, moved merely by impulse. He\nis bound to his family by sacred, holy ties. Every member of the\nfamily centers in the father. His name, \u201chouse-band,\u201d is the true\ndefinition of husband. He is the lawmaker, illustrating in his own\nmanly bearing the sterner virtues, energy, integrity, honesty, and\npractical usefulness. The father is in one sense the priest of the\nhousehold, laying upon the altar of God the morning and evening\nsacrifice, while the wife and children unite in prayer and praise.\nWith such a household Jesus will tarry, and through His quickening\ninfluence the parents\u2019 joyful exclamations shall yet be heard amid\nmore exalted scenes, saying: \u201cBehold, I and the children whom the\nLord hath given me.\u201d Saved, saved, eternally saved! freed from the\ncorruption that is in the world through lust, and through the merits of\nChrist made heirs of immortality! I saw that but few fathers realize\ntheir responsibility. They have not learned to control themselves, and\nuntil this lesson is learned they will make poor work in governing\ntheir children. Perfect self-control will act as a charm upon the\nObedience to the Truth 515\nfamily. When this is attained, a great victory is gained. Then they\ncan educate their children to self-control.\nMy heart yearns over the church at -----, for there is a work to be\naccomplished there. It is God\u2019s design to have a people in that place.\nThere is material there for a good church, but there is considerable\nwork to be done to remove the rough edges and prepare them for\nworking order, that all may labor unitedly and draw in even cords. It\nhas hitherto been the case that when one or two felt the necessity of [548]\narousing and standing unitedly and more firmly upon the elevated\nplatform of truth, others would make no effort to arise. Satan puts in\nthem a spirit to rebel, to discourage those who would advance. They\nbrace themselves when urged to take hold of the work, a stubborn\nspirit comes upon some, and when they should help they hinder.\nSome will not submit to the planing knife of God. As it passes over\nthem, and the uneven surface is disturbed, they complain of too close\nand severe work. They wish to get out of God\u2019s workshop, where\ntheir defects may remain undisturbed. They seem to be asleep as to\ntheir condition; but their only hope is to remain where the defects in\ntheir Christian character will be seen and remedied.\nSome are indulging lustful appetite which wars against the soul\nand is a constant hindrance to their spiritual advancement. They\nconstantly bear an accusing conscience, and if straight truths are\ntalked they are prepared to be offended. They are self-condemned\nand feel that subjects have been purposely selected to touch their\ncase. They feel grieved and injured, and withdraw themselves from\nthe assemblies of the saints. They forsake the assembling of them-\nselves together, for then their consciences are not so disturbed. They\nsoon lose their interest in the meetings and their love for the truth,\nand, unless they entirely reform, will go back and take their position\nwith the rebel host who stand under the black banner of Satan. If\nthese will crucify fleshly lusts which war against the soul, they will\nget out of the way, where the arrows of truth will pass harmlessly\nby them. But while they indulge lustful appetite, and thus cherish\ntheir idols, they make themselves a mark for the arrows of truth to\nhit, and if truth is spoken at all, they must be wounded. Some think\nthat they cannot reform, that health would be sacrificed should they\nattempt to leave the use of tea, tobacco, and flesh meats. This is\nthe suggestion of Satan. It is these hurtful stimulants that are surely [549]\n516 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nundermining the constitution and preparing the system for acute\ndiseases by impairing Nature\u2019s fine machinery and battering down\nher fortifications erected against disease and premature decay.\nThose who make a change and leave off these unnatural stimu-\nlants will for a time feel their loss and suffer considerably without\nthem, as does the drunkard who is wedded to his liquor. Take away\nintoxicating drinks and he suffers terribly. But if he persists he will\nsoon overcome the dreadful lack. Nature will come to his aid and\nremain at her post until he again substitutes the false prop in her\nplace. Some have so benumbed the fine sensibilities of Nature that\nit may require a little time for her to recover from the abuse she has\nbeen made to suffer through the sinful habits of man, the indulgence\nof an acquired, depraved appetite, which has depressed and weak-\nened her powers. Give Nature a chance, and she will rally and again\nperform her part nobly and well. The use of unnatural stimulants\nis destructive to health and has a benumbing influence upon the\nbrain, making it impossible to appreciate eternal things. Those who\ncherish these idols cannot rightly value the salvation which Christ\nhas wrought out for them by a life of self-denial, continual suffering\nand reproach, and by finally yielding His own sinless life to save\nperishing man from death.\n* * * * *\nChapter 96\u2014Life Insurance\nI was shown that Sabbathkeeping Adventists should not engage\nin life insurance. This is a commerce with the world which God\ndoes not approve. Those who engage in this enterprise are uniting\nwith the world, while God calls His people to come out from among\nthem and to be separate. Said the angel: \u201cChrist has purchased you\nby the sacrifice of His life. \u2018What? know ye not that your body is [550]\nthe temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God,\nand ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore\nglorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u2019 \u2018For\nye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ,\nwho is your life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with Him in\nglory.\u2019\u201d Here is the only life insurance which heaven sanctions.\nLife insurance is a worldly policy which leads our brethren\nwho engage in it to depart from the simplicity and purity of the\ngospel. Every such departure weakens our faith and lessens our\nspirituality. Said the angel: \u201cBut ye are a chosen generation, a royal\npriesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show\nforth the praises of Him who hath called you out of darkness into His\nmarvelous light.\u201d As a people we are in a special sense the Lord\u2019s.\nChrist has bought us. Angels that excel in strength surround us.\nNot a sparrow falls to the ground without the notice of our heavenly\nFather. Even the hairs of our head are numbered. God has made\nprovision for His people. He has a special care for them, and they\nshould not distrust His providence by engaging in a policy with the\nworld.\nGod designs that we should preserve in simplicity and holiness\nour peculiarity as a people. Those who engage in this worldly policy\ninvest means which belong to God, which He has entrusted to them\nto use in His cause, to advance His work. But few will realize any\nreturns from life insurance, and without God\u2019s blessing even these\nwill prove an injury instead of a benefit. Those whom God has made\n517\n518 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nHis stewards have no right to place in the enemy\u2019s ranks the means\nwhich He has entrusted to them to use in His cause.\nSatan is constantly presenting inducements to God\u2019s chosen peo-\nple to attract their minds from the solemn work of preparation for\nthe scenes just in the future. He is in every sense of the word a[551]\ndeceiver, a skillful charmer. He clothes his plans and snares with\ncoverings of light borrowed from heaven. He tempted Eve to eat of\nthe forbidden fruit by making her believe that she would be greatly\nadvantaged thereby. Satan leads his agents to introduce various in-\nventions and patent rights and other enterprises, that Sabbathkeeping\nAdventists who are in haste to be rich may fall into temptation, be-\ncome ensnared, and pierce themselves through with many sorrows.\nHe is wide awake, busily engaged in leading the world captive, and\nthrough the agency of worldlings he keeps up a continual pleasing\nexcitement to draw the unwary who profess to believe the truth to\nunite with worldlings. The lust of the eye, the desire for excitement\nand pleasing entertainment, is a temptation and snare to God\u2019s peo-\nple. Satan has many finely woven, dangerous nets which are made to\nappear innocent, but with which he is skillfully preparing to infatuate\nGod\u2019s people. There are pleasing shows, entertainments, phrenolog-\nical lectures, and an endless variety of enterprises constantly arising\ncalculated to lead the people of God to love the world and the things\nthat are in the world. Through this union with the world, faith be-\ncomes weakened, and means which should be invested in the cause\nof present truth are transferred to the enemy\u2019s ranks. Through these\ndifferent channels Satan is skillfully draining the purses of God\u2019s\npeople, and for it the displeasure of the Lord is upon them.\n* * * * *\nChapter 97\u2014Circulate the Publications\nI have been shown that we are not doing our duty in the gratuitous\ncirculation of small publications. There are many honest souls who\nmight be brought to embrace the truth by this means alone. Should\nthere be on each copy of these small tracts an advertisement of our\npublications and the place where they can be obtained, it would [552]\nextend the circulation of the larger publications and the Review,\nInstructor, and Reformer.\nThese small tracts of four, eight, or sixteen pages can be fur-\nnished for a trifle from a fund raised by the donations of those who\nhave the cause at heart. When you write to a friend you can enclose\none or more without increasing postage. When you meet persons\nin the cars, on the boat, or in the stage who seem to have an ear to\nhear, you can hand them a tract. These tracts should not at present\nbe scattered promiscuously like the autumn leaves, but should be\njudiciously and freely handed to those who would be likely to prize\nthem. Thus our publications and the Publishing Association will be\nadvertised in a manner that will result in much good.\n* * * * *\n519\nChapter 98\u2014The \u201cHealth Reformer\u201d\nThe people are perishing for want of knowledge. Says the apos-\ntle: \u201cAdd to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge.\u201d After receiv-\ning the faith of the gospel, our first work is to seek to add virtuous\nand pure principles, and thus cleanse the mind and heart for the\nreception of true knowledge. Disease of almost every description\nis pressing upon the people, yet they seem willing to remain in\nignorance of the means of relief and the course to pursue to avoid\ndisease.\nIn the establishment of the Health Institute it was the design of\nGod not only that knowledge might be imparted to the comparatively\nfew who should visit it, but that the many might be instructed as to\nhome treatment. The Health Reformer is the medium through which\nrays of light are to shine upon the people. It should be the very\nbest health journal in our country. It must be adapted to the wants\nof the common people, ready to answer all proper questions and\nfully explain the first principles of the laws of life and how to obey\nthem and preserve health. The great object to be kept in view by[553]\nthe publication of such a journal should be the good of the suffering\npeople of God. The common people, especially those too poor to\nattend the Institute, must be reached and instructed by the Health\nReformer.\n* * * * *\n520\nChapter 99\u2014The Health Institute\nIn the vision given me December 25, 1865, I saw that the health\nreform was a great enterprise, closely connected with the present\ntruth, and that Seventh-day Adventists should have a home for the\nsick where they could be treated for their diseases and also learn\nhow to take care of themselves so as to prevent sickness. I saw that\nour people should not remain indifferent upon this subject and leave\nthe rich among us to go to the popular water cure institutions of the\ncountry for the recovery of health, where they would find opposition\nto, rather than sympathy with, their views of religious faith. Those\nwho are reduced by disease suffer not only for want of physical\nbut also of mental and moral strength; and afflicted, conscientious\nSabbathkeepers cannot receive as much benefit where they feel that\nthey must be constantly guarded lest they compromise their faith\nand dishonor their profession, as at an institution whose physicians\nand conductors are in sympathy with the truths connected with the\nthird angel\u2019s message.\nWhen persons who have suffered much from disease are relieved\nby an intelligent system of treatment, consisting of baths, healthful\ndiet, proper periods of rest and exercise, and the beneficial effects of\npure air, they are often led to conclude that those who successfully\ntreat them are right in matters of religious faith, or, at least, cannot\ngreatly err from the truth. Thus if our people are left to go to those\ninstitutions whose physicians are corrupt in religious faith, they are\nin danger of being ensnared. The institution at -----, I then saw (in [554]\n1865), was the best in the United States. So far as the treatment\nof the sick is concerned, they have been doing a great and good\nwork; but they urge upon their patients dancing and card playing,\nand recommend attendance at theaters and such places of worldly\namusement, which is in direct opposition to the teachings of Christ\nand the apostles.\nThose connected with the Health Institute now located at Battle\nCreek should feel that they are engaged in an important and solemn\n521\n522 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwork, and in no way should they pattern after the physicians at the\ninstitution at ----- in matters of religion and amusements. Yet I saw\nthat there would be danger of imitating them in many things and\nlosing sight of the exalted character of this great work. And should\nthose connected with this enterprise cease to look at their work from\na high religious standpoint, and descend from the exalted principles\nof present truth to imitate in theory and practice those at the head of\ninstitutions where the sick are treated only for the recovery of health,\nthe special blessing of God would not rest upon our institution more\nthan upon those where corrupt theories are taught and practiced.\nI saw that a very extensive work could not be accomplished in\na short time, as it would not be an easy matter to find physicians\nwhom God could approve and who would work together harmo-\nniously, disinterestedly, and zealously for the good of suffering hu-\nmanity. It should ever be kept prominent that the great object to be\nattained through this channel is not only health, but perfection, and\nthe spirit of holiness, which cannot be attained with diseased bodies\nand minds. This object cannot be secured by working merely from\nthe worldling\u2019s standpoint. God will raise up men and qualify them\nto engage in the work, not only as physicians of the body, but of the\nsin-sick soul, as spiritual fathers to the young and inexperienced.\nI was shown that the position of Dr. E in regard to amusements\nwas wrong, and that his views of physical exercise were not all[555]\ncorrect. The amusements which he recommends hinder the recovery\nof health in many cases to one that is helped by them. He has\nto a great degree condemned physical labor for the sick, and his\nteaching in many cases has proved a great injury to them. Such\nmental exercise as playing cards, chess, and checkers excites and\nwearies the brain and hinders recovery, while light and pleasant\nphysical labor will occupy the time, improve the circulation, relieve\nand restore the brain, and prove a decided benefit to the health. But\ntake from the invalid all such employment, and he becomes restless,\nand, with a diseased imagination, views his case as much worse than\nit really is, which tends to imbecility.\nFor years I have from time to time been shown that the sick\nshould be taught that it is wrong to suspend all physical labor in\norder to regain health. In thus doing the will becomes dormant, the\nblood moves sluggishly through the system and constantly grows\nHealth Institute 523\nmore impure. Where the patient is in danger of imagining his case\nworse than it really is, indolence will be sure to produce the most\nunhappy results. Well-regulated labor gives the invalid the idea that\nhe is not totally useless in the world, that he is, at least, of some\nbenefit. This will afford him satisfaction, give him courage, and\nimpart to him vigor, which vain mental amusements can never do.\nThe view that those who have abused both their physical and\nmental powers, or who have broken down in either mind or body,\nmust suspend activity in order to regain health, is a great error. In a\nvery few cases entire rest for a short period may be necessary, but\nthese instances are very rare. In most cases the change would be\ntoo great. Those who have broken down by intense mental labor\nshould have rest from wearing thought, yet to teach them that it is\nwrong and even dangerous for them to exercise their mental powers\nto a degree leads them to view their condition as worse than it really\nis. They become still more nervous and are a great trouble and [556]\nannoyance to those who have the care of them. In this state of mind\ntheir recovery is doubtful indeed.\nThose who have broken down by physical exertion must have\nless labor, and that which is light and pleasant. But to shut them away\nfrom all labor and exercise would in many cases prove their ruin.\nThe will goes with the labor of their hands, and those accustomed\nto labor would feel that they were only machines to be acted upon\nby physicians and attendants, and the imagination would become\ndiseased. Inactivity is the greatest curse that could come upon such.\nTheir powers become so dormant that it is impossible for them to\nresist disease and languor, as they must do in order to regain health.\nDr. E has made a great mistake in regard to exercise and amuse-\nments, and a still greater in his teaching concerning religious ex-\nperience and religious excitement. The religion of the Bible is not\ndetrimental to the health of body or mind. The exalting influence of\nthe Spirit of God is the best restorative for the sick. Heaven is all\nhealth, and the more fully the heavenly influences are felt the more\nsure the recovery of the believing invalid. The influence of such\nviews as are advanced by Dr. E has reached us as a people in some\ndegree. Sabbathkeeping health reformers must be free from all these.\nEvery true and real reform will bring us nearer to God and heaven,\n524 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ncloser to the side of Jesus, and increase our knowledge of spiritual\nthings and deepen in us the holiness of Christian experience.\nIt is true that there are unbalanced minds that impose upon them-\nselves fasting which the Scriptures do not teach, and prayers and\nprivation of rest and sleep which God has never required. Such\nare not prospered and sustained in their voluntary acts of righteous-\nness. They have a pharisaical religion which is not of Christ, but\nof themselves. They trust in their good works for salvation, vainly\nhoping to earn heaven by their meritorious works instead of relying,[557]\nas every sinner should, upon the merits of a crucified, risen, and\nexalted Saviour. These are almost sure to become sickly. But Christ\nand true godliness are health to the body and strength to the soul.\nLet invalids do something instead of occupying their minds with\na simple play, which lowers them in their own estimation and leads\nthem to think their lives useless. Keep the power of the will awake,\nfor the will aroused and rightly directed is a potent soother of the\nnerves. Invalids are far happier to be employed, and their recovery\nis more easily effected.\nI saw that the greatest curse that ever came upon my husband\nand Sister F was the instructions they received at ----- in regard to\nremaining inactive in order to recover. The imagination of both was\ndiseased, and their inactivity resulted in the thought and feeling that\nit would be dangerous to health and life to exercise, especially if\nin doing so they became weary. The machinery of the system, so\nseldom put in motion, lost its elasticity and strength, so that when\nthey did exercise, their joints were stiff and their muscles feeble,\nand every move required great effort and of course caused pain.\nYet this very weariness would have proved a blessing to them had\nthey, irrespective of feeling or unpleasant symptoms, perseveringly\nresisted their inclinations to inactivity.\nI saw that it would be far better for Sister F to be with her family\nby herself and feel the responsibilities resting upon her. This would\nawaken into life her dormant energies. I was shown that the broken-\nup condition of this dear family while at ----- was unfavorable to the\neducation and training of their children. For their own good these\nchildren should be learning to take responsibilities in household\nlabor and should feel that some burdens in life rest upon them. The\nmother, engaged in the education and training of her children, is\nHealth Institute 525\nemployed in the very work which God has assigned to her and for\nthe sake of which He has in mercy heard the prayers offered for her [558]\nrecovery. While she should shun wearing labor, she should above\nall avoid a life of inactivity.\nWhen the vision was given me at Rochester, New York, I saw\nthat it would be far better for these parents and children to form a\nfamily by themselves. The children should each do a part of the\nfamily labor and thus obtain a valuable education which could not\nbe obtained in any other way. Life at ----- or in any other place,\nsurrounded by waiters and helpers, is the greatest possible injury to\nmothers and children. Jesus invites Sister F to find rest in Him and\nto let her mind receive a healthy tone by dwelling upon heavenly\nthings and earnestly seeking to bring up her little flock in the nurture\nand admonition of the Lord. In this way she can best assist her\nhusband by relieving him of the feeling that she must be the object\nof so much of his attention, care, and sympathy.\nAs to the extent of the accommodations of the Health Institute at\nBattle Creek, I was shown, as I have before stated, that we should\nhave such an institution, small at its commencement, and cautiously\nincreased, as good physicians and helpers could be procured and\nmeans raised, and as the wants of invalids should demand; and all\nshould be conducted in strict accordance with the principles and\nhumble spirit of the third angel\u2019s message. And as I have seen the\nlarge calculations hastily urged by those who have taken a leading\npart in the work, I have felt alarmed, and in many private conversa-\ntions and in letters I have warned these brethren to move cautiously.\nMy reasons for this are that without the special blessing of God\nthere are several ways in which this enterprise might be hindered,\nfor a time at least, any one of which would be detrimental to the\ninstitution and an injury to the cause. Should the physicians fail,\nthrough sickness, death, or any other cause, to fill their places, the\nwork would be hindered till others were raised up; or should means\nfail to come in when extensive buildings were in process of erection,\nand the work stop, capital would be sunk, and a general discourage-\nment would come over all interested; also there might be a lack of [559]\npatients to occupy present accommodations, consequently a lack\nof means to meet present expenses. With all the efforts in every\ndepartment put forth in a correct and judicious manner, and with the\n526 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nblessing of God, the institution will prove a glorious success, while\na single failure in any one direction might sooner or later prove a\ngreat injury. It should not be forgotten that out of many hygienic\ninstitutions started in the United States within the last twenty-five\nyears but few maintain even a visible existence at the present time.\nI have publicly appealed to our brethren in behalf of an institution\nto be established among us, and have spoken in the highest terms\nof Dr. F as the man who has in the providence of God obtained\nan experience to act a part as physician. This I have said upon\nthe authority of what God has shown me. If necessary, I would\nunhesitatingly repeat all that I have said. I have no desire to withdraw\none sentence that I have written or spoken. The work is of God and\nmust be prosecuted with a firm yet cautious hand.\nThe health reform is closely connected with the work of the third\nmessage, yet it is not the message. Our preachers should teach the\nhealth reform, yet they should not make this the leading theme in\nthe place of the message. Its place is among those subjects which\nset forth the preparatory work to meet the events brought to view\nby the message; among these it is prominent. We should take hold\nof every reform with zeal, yet should avoid giving the impression\nthat we are vacillating and subject to fanaticism. Our people should\nfurnish means to meet the wants of a growing Health Institute among\nus, as they are able to do without giving less for the other wants of\nthe cause. Let the health reform and the Health Institute grow up\namong us as other worthy enterprises have grown, taking into the\naccount our feeble strength in the past and our greater ability to do\nmuch in a short period of time now. Let the Health Institute grow,\nas other interests among us have grown, as fast as it can safely and[560]\nnot cripple other branches of the great work which are of equal or\ngreater importance at this time. For a brother to put a large share of\nhis property, whether he has much or little into the Institute, so as to\nbe unable to do as much in other directions as he otherwise should,\nwould be wrong. And for him to do nothing would be as great a\nwrong. With every stirring appeal to our people for means to put\ninto the Institute there should have been a caution not to rob other\nbranches of the work; especially should the liberal poor have been\ncautioned. Some feeble poor men with families, without a home\nof their own, and too poor to go to the Institute to be treated, have\nHealth Institute 527\nput from one fifth to one third of all they possess into the Institute.\nThis is wrong. Some brethren and sisters have several shares when\nthey should not have one, and should for a short time attend the\nInstitute, having their expenses paid, wholly or in part, from the\ncharity fund. I do not see the wisdom of making great calculations\nfor the future and letting those suffer who need help now. Move no\nfaster, brethren, than the unmistakable providence of God opens the\nway before you.\nThe health reform is a branch of the special work of God for\nthe benefit of His people. I saw that in an institution established\namong us the greatest danger would be of its managers\u2019 departing\nfrom the spirit of the present truth and from that simplicity which\nshould ever characterize the disciples of Christ . A warning was\ngiven me against lowering the standard of truth in any way in such\nan institution in order to help the feelings of unbelievers and thus\nsecure their patronage. The great object of receiving unbelievers into\nthe institution is to lead them to embrace the truth. If the standard\nbe lowered, they will get the impression that the truth is of little\nimportance, and they will go away in a state of mind harder of\naccess than before.\nBut the greatest evil resulting from such a course would be its [561]\ninfluence upon the poor, afflicted, believing patients, which would\naffect the cause generally. They have been taught to trust in the\nprayer of faith, and many of them are bowed down in spirit because\nprayer is not now more fully answered. I saw that the reason why\nGod did not hear the prayers of His servants for the sick among us\nmore fully was that He could not be glorified in so doing while they\nwere violating the laws of health. And I also saw that He designed\nthe health reform and Health Institute to prepare the way for the\nprayer of faith to be fully answered. Faith and good works should\ngo hand in hand in relieving the afflicted among us, and in fitting\nthem to glorify God here and to be saved at the coming of Christ.\nGod forbid that these afflicted ones should ever be disappointed and\ngrieved in finding the managers of the Institute working only from\na worldly standpoint instead of adding to the hygienic practice the\nblessings and virtues of nursing fathers and mothers in Israel.\nLet no one obtain the idea that the Institute is the place for\nthem to come to be raised up by the prayer of faith. That is the\n528 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nplace to find relief from disease by treatment and right habits of\nliving, and to learn how to avoid sickness. But if there is one place\nunder the heavens more than another where soothing, sympathizing\nprayer should be offered by men and women of devotion and faith\nit is at such an institute. Those who treat the sick should move\nforward in their important work with strong reliance upon God for\nHis blessing to attend the means which He has graciously provided,\nand to which He has in mercy called our attention as a people, such\nas pure air, cleanliness, healthful diet, proper periods of labor and\nrepose, and the use of water. They should have no selfish interest\noutside of this important and solemn work. To care properly for\nthe physical and spiritual interests of the afflicted people of God\nwho have reposed almost unlimited confidence in them and have at\ngreat expense placed themselves under their care will require their[562]\nundivided attention. No one has so great a mind, or is so skillful, but\nthat the work will be imperfect after he has done his very best.\nLet those to whom are committed the physical and also to a\ngreat extent the spiritual interests of the afflicted people of God,\nbeware how they, through worldly policy or personal interest or a\ndesire to be engaged in a great and popular work, call down upon\nthemselves and this branch of the cause the frown of God. They\nshould not depend upon their skill alone. If the blessing, instead\nof the frown, of God be upon the institution, angels will attend\npatients, helpers, and physicians to assist in the work of restoration,\nso that in the end the glory will be given to God and not to feeble,\nshortsighted man. Should these men work from a worldly policy,\nand should their hearts be lifted up and they feel to say, \u201cMy power,\nand the might of my hand hath done this,\u201d God would leave them\nto work under the great disadvantages of their inferiority to other\ninstitutions in knowledge, experience, and facilities. They could not\nthen accomplish half as much as other institutions do.\nI saw the beneficial influence of outdoor labor upon those of\nfeeble vitality and depressed circulation, especially upon women\nwho have induced these conditions by too much confinement in-\ndoors. Their blood has become impure for want of fresh air and\nexercise. Instead of amusements to keep these persons indoors, care\nshould be taken to provide outdoor attractions. I saw there should be\nconnected with the Institute ample grounds, beautified with flowers\nHealth Institute 529\nand planted with vegetables and fruits. Here the feeble could find\nwork, appropriate to their sex and condition, at suitable hours. These\ngrounds should be under the care of an experienced gardener to\ndirect all in a tasteful, orderly manner.\nThe relation which I sustain to this work demands of me an\nunfettered expression of my views. I speak freely and choose this [563]\nmedium to speak to all interested. What appeared in Testimony No.\n11 concerning the Health Institute should not have been given until\nI was able to write out all I had seen in regard to it. I intended to\nsay nothing upon the subject in No. 11, and sent all the manuscript\nthat I designed for that Testimony from Ottawa County, where I was\nthen laboring, to the office at Battle Creek, stating that I wished\nthem to hasten out that little work, as it was much needed, and as\nsoon as possible I would write No. 12, in which I designed to speak\nfreely and fully concerning the Institute. The brethren at Battle\nCreek who were especially interested in the Institute knew I had\nseen that our people should contribute of their means to establish\nsuch an institution. They therefore wrote to me that the influence of\nmy testimony in regard to the Institute was needed immediately to\nmove the brethren upon the subject, and that the publication of No.\n11 would be delayed till I could write.\nThis was a great trial to me, as I knew I could not write out all I\nhad seen, for I was then speaking to the people six or eight times a\nweek, visiting from house to house, and writing hundreds of pages\nof personal testimonies and private letters. This amount of labor,\nwith unnecessary burdens and trials thrown upon me, unfitted me\nfor labor of any kind. My health was poor, and my mental sufferings\nwere beyond description. Under these circumstances I yielded my\njudgment to that of others and wrote what appeared in No. 11 in\nregard to the Health Institute, being unable then to give all I had seen.\nIn this I did wrong. I must be allowed to know my own duty better\nthan others can know it for me, especially concerning matters which\nGod has revealed to me. I shall be blamed by some for speaking as\nI now speak. Others will blame me for not speaking before. The\ndisposition manifested to crowd the matter of the Institute so fast\nhas been one of the heaviest trials I have ever borne. If all who have\nused my testimony to move the brethren had been equally moved by [564]\nit themselves, I should be better satisfied. Should I delay longer to\n530 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nspeak my views and feelings, I should be blamed the more both by\nthose who think I should have spoken sooner and by those also who\nmay think I should not give any cautions. For the good of those at\nthe head of the work, for the good of the cause and the brethren, and\nto save myself great trials, I have freely spoken.\nChapter 100\u2014Health and Religion\n[This and the following article are extracts from letters which I\naddressed to those at the head of the Health Institute, the first one,\nthe first of May, 1867, and the second, in June following. E. G. W.]\nGod would have a health institution established which will in\nits influence be closely connected with the closing work for mortals\nfitting for immortality, one that will have no tendency to weaken the\nreligious principles of old or young and which will not improve the\nhealth of the body to the detriment of spiritual growth. The great\nobject of this institution should be to improve the health of the body,\nthat the afflicted may more highly appreciate eternal things. If this\nobject is not continually set before the mind and efforts are not made\nto this end, it will prove a curse instead of a blessing, spirituality\nwill be regarded as a secondary thing, and the health of the body and\ndiversion will be made primary.\nI saw that the high standard should not be lowered in the least\nin order that the institution may be patronized by unbelievers. If\nunbelievers choose to come while its conductors occupy the exalted\nspiritual position which God designs they should, there will be a\npower that will affect their hearts. With God and angels on their side,\nHis commandment-keeping people can but prosper. This institution\nis not to be established for the object of gain, but to aid in bringing\nGod\u2019s people into such a condition of physical and mental health as [565]\nwill enable them to rightly appreciate eternal things and to correctly\nvalue the redemption so dearly purchased by the sufferings of our\nSaviour. This institution is not to be made a place for diversion or\namusement. Those who cannot live unless they have excitement and\ndiversion will be of no use to the world; none are made better for\ntheir living. They might just as well be out of the world as to be in it.\nI saw that the view that spirituality is a detriment to health, which\nDr. E sought to instill into the minds of others, is but the sophistry of\nthe devil. Satan found his way into Eden and made Eve believe that\n531\n532 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nshe needed something more than that which God had given for her\nhappiness, that the forbidden fruit would have a special exhilarating\ninfluence upon her body and mind, and would exalt her even to be\nequal with God in knowledge. But the knowledge and benefit she\nthought to gain proved to her a terrible curse.\nThere are persons with a diseased imagination to whom religion\nis a tyrant, ruling them as with a rod of iron. Such are constantly\nmourning over their depravity and groaning over supposed evil.\nLove does not exist in their hearts; a frown is ever upon their coun-\ntenances. They are chilled by the innocent laugh from the youth or\nfrom anyone. They consider all recreation or amusement a sin and\nthink that the mind must be constantly wrought up to just such a\nstern, severe pitch. This is one extreme. Others think that the mind\nmust be ever on the stretch to invent new amusements and diversions\nin order to gain health. They learn to depend on excitement, and are\nuneasy without it. Such are not true Christians. They go to another\nextreme. The true principles of Christianity open before all a source\nof happiness, the height and depth, the length and breadth of which\nare immeasurable. It is Christ in us a well of water springing up into\neverlasting life. It is a continual wellspring from which the Christian[566]\ncan drink at will and never exhaust the fountain.\nThat which brings sickness of body and mind to nearly all is\ndissatisfied feelings and discontented repinings. They have not\nGod, they have not the hope which reaches to that within the veil,\nwhich is as an anchor to the soul both sure and steadfast. All who\npossess this hope will purify themselves even as He is pure. Such are\nfree from restless longings, repinings, and discontent; they are not\ncontinually looking for evil and brooding over borrowed trouble. But\nwe see many who are having a time of trouble beforehand; anxiety\nis stamped upon every feature; they seem to find no consolation, but\nhave a continual fearful looking for of some dreadful evil.\nSuch dishonor God, and bring the religion of Christ into disre-\npute. They have not true love for God, nor for their companions and\nchildren. Their affections have become morbid. But vain amuse-\nments will never correct the minds of such. They need the trans-\nforming influence of the Spirit of God in order to be happy. They\nneed to be benefited by the mediation of Christ, in order to realize\nconsolation, divine and substantial. \u201cFor he that will love life, and\nHealth and Religion 533\nsee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that\nthey speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek\npeace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous,\nand His ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is\nagainst them that do evil.\u201d Those who have an experimental knowl-\nedge of this scripture are truly happy. They consider the approbation\nof Heaven of more worth than any earthly amusement; Christ in\nthem the hope of glory will be health to the body and strength to the\nsoul.\nThe simplicity of the gospel is fast disappearing from professed\nSabbathkeepers. I inquire a hundred times a day, How can God\nprosper us? There is but little praying. In fact, prayer is almost\nobsolete. Few are willing to bear the cross of Christ, who bore\nthe shameful cross for us. I cannot feel that things are moving at [567]\nthe Institute as God would have them move. I fear that He will\nturn His face from it. I was shown that physicians and helpers\nshould be of the highest order, those who have an experimental\nknowledge of the truth, who will command respect, and whose\nword can be relied on. They should be persons who have not a\ndiseased imagination, persons who have perfect self-control, who\nare not fitful or changeable, who are free from jealousy and evil\nsurmising, persons who have a power of will that will not yield to\nslight indispositions, who are unprejudiced, who will think no evil,\nwho think and move calmly, considerately, having the glory of God\nand the good of others ever before them. Never should one be exalted\nto a responsible position merely because he desires it. Those only\nshould be chosen who are qualified for the position. Those who are\nto bear responsibilities should first be proved and give evidence that\nthey are free from jealousy, that they will not take a dislike to this or\nthat one, while they have a few favored friends and take no notice of\nothers. God grant that all may move just right in that institution.\n* * * * *\nChapter 101\u2014Work and Amusements\nDear Brother F ,\nMy mind has been considerably exercised upon one or two\npoints. When I get where I am writing letters to you night after\nnight in my sleep, I then think it time to carry out my convictions of\nduty. When I was shown that Dr. E erred in some things in regard\nto the instructions he gave his patients, I saw that you had received\nthe same ideas in many things and that the time would come when\nyou would see correctly in regard to the matter. These are concern-\ning work and amusements. I was shown that it would prove more\nbeneficial to most patients to allow light work, and even to urge it\nupon them, than to urge them to remain inactive and idle. If the[568]\npower of the will be kept active to arouse the dormant faculties, it\nwill be the greatest help to recover health. Remove all labor from\nthose who have been overtaxed all their lives and in nine cases out\nof ten the change will be an injury. This has proved true in the\ncase of my husband. I was shown that physical, outdoor exercise is\nfar preferable to indoor; but if this cannot be secured, light indoor\nemployment would occupy and divert the mind, and prevent it from\ndwelling upon symptoms and little ailments, and would also prevent\nhomesickness.\nThis do-nothing system, I saw, had been the greatest curse to\nyour wife and my husband. God gave employment to the first pair\nin Eden because He knew they would be happier when employed.\nFrom what has been shown me, this do-nothing system is a curse\nto soul and body. Light employment will not excite or tax the mind\nor strength any more than amusements. The sick often get where\nthey look at their poor feelings and think themselves utterly unable\nto do anything, when, if they would arouse the will and compel\nthemselves to do an amount of physical labor every day, they would\nbe far happier and improve much faster. I shall write more fully\nupon this point hereafter.\n534\nWork and Amusements 535\n* * * * *\nI understand from a recent Rochester paper that card playing is\nno longer practiced as an amusement at the institution in -----.\nE.G.W., note to first edition.\n536 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber Thirteen\u2014Testimony for the [569]\nChurch\nIntroduction\nAgain I feel it my duty to speak to the Lord\u2019s people in great\nplainness. It is humiliating to me to point out the errors and rebellion\nof those who have long been acquainted with us and our work. I\ndo it to correct wrong statements that have gone abroad concerning\nmy husband and myself calculated to injure the cause, and as a\nwarning to others. If we only were to suffer, I would be silent;\nbut when the cause is in danger of reproach and suffering, I must\nspeak, however humiliating. Proud hypocrites will triumph over\nour brethren because they are humble enough to confess their sins.\nGod loves His people who keep His commandments, and reproves\nthem, not because they are the worst, but because they are the best\npeople in the world. \u201cAs many as I love,\u201d says Jesus, \u201cI rebuke and\nchasten.\u201d\nI would call especial attention to the remarkable dreams given\nin this little work, all with harmony and distinctness illustrating the\nsame things. The multitude of dreams arise from the common things\nof life, with which the Spirit of God has nothing to do. There are\nalso false dreams, as well as false visions, which are inspired by\nthe spirit of Satan. But dreams from the Lord are classed in the\nword of God with visions and are as truly the fruits of the spirit\nof prophecy as visions. Such dreams, taking into the account the\npersons who have them and the circumstances under which they are[570]\ngiven, contain their own proofs of their genuineness.\nMay the blessing of God attend this little work.\n* * * * *\n538\nChapter 102\u2014Sketch of Experience\nFrom December 19, 1866 to April 25, 1867\nHaving become fully satisfied that my husband would not recover\nfrom his protracted sickness while remaining inactive, and that the\ntime had fully come for me to go forth and bear my testimony to the\npeople, I decided, contrary to the judgment and advice of the church\nat Battle Creek, of which we were members at that time, to venture a\ntour in northern Michigan, with my husband in his extremely feeble\ncondition, in the severest cold of winter. It required no small degree\nof moral courage and faith in God to bring my mind to the decision\nto risk so much, especially as I stood alone, with the influence of\nthe church, including those at the head of the work at Battle Creek,\nagainst me.\nBut I knew that I had a work to do, and it seemed to me that\nSatan was determined to keep me from it. I had waited long for our\ncaptivity to be turned and feared that precious souls would be lost if\nI remained longer from the work. To remain longer from the field\nseemed to me worse than death, and should we move out we could\nbut perish. So, on the 19th of December, 1866, we left Battle Creek\nin a snowstorm for Wright, Ottawa County, Michigan. My husband\nstood the long and severe journey of ninety miles much better than\nI feared, and seemed quite as well when we reached our old home\nat Brother Root\u2019s as when we left Battle Creek. We were kindly\nreceived by this dear family and as tenderly cared for as Christian\nparents can care for invalid children.\nWe found this church in a very low condition. With a large\nportion of its members the seeds of disunion and dissatisfaction [571]\nwith one another were taking deep root, and a worldly spirit was\ntaking possession of them. And notwithstanding their low state they\nhad enjoyed the labors of our preachers so seldom that they were\nhungry for spiritual food. Here commenced our first effective labors\nsince the sickness of my husband. Here he commenced to labor\nas in former years, though in much weakness. He would speak\n539\n540 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthirty or forty minutes in the forenoon of both Sabbath and first\nday, and I would fill up the rest of the time, and then speak about\nan hour and a half in the afternoon of each day. We were listened\nto with the greatest attention. I saw that my husband was growing\nstronger, clearer, and more connected in his subjects. And when on\none occasion he spoke one hour with clearness and power, with the\nburden of the work upon him as when he used to speak, my feelings\nof gratitude were beyond expression. I arose in the congregation and\nfor nearly half an hour tried with weeping to give utterance to them.\nThe congregation felt deeply. I felt assured that this was the dawn of\nbetter days for us.\nWe remained with this people six weeks. I spoke to them twenty-\nfive times, and my husband twelve times. As our labors with this\nchurch progressed, individual cases began to open before me, and\nI commenced to write out testimonies for them, amounting in all\nto one hundred pages. Then commenced labor for these persons\nas they came to Brother Root\u2019s, where we were stopping, and with\nsome of them at their homes, but more especially in meetings at the\nhouse of worship. In this kind of labor I found that my husband was\na great help. His long experience in this kind of work, as he had\nlabored with me in the past, had qualified him for it. And now that\nhe entered upon it again he seemed to manifest all that clearness of\nthought, good judgment, and faithfulness in dealing with the erring,\nof former days. In fact, no other two of our ministers could have\nrendered me the assistance that he did.\nA great and good work was done for this dear people. Wrongs[572]\nwere freely and fully confessed, union was restored, and the blessing\nof God rested down upon the work. My husband labored to bring\nup the systematic benevolence of the church to the figures which\nshould be adopted in all our churches, and his efforts resulted in\nraising the amount to be paid into the treasury annually by that\nchurch about three hundred dollars. Those in the church who had\nbeen in trial about some of my testimonies, especially respecting the\ndress question, became fully settled on hearing the matter explained.\nThe health and the dress reform were adopted, and a large amount\nwas raised for the Health Institute.\nHere I think it my duty to state that as this work was in progress,\nunfortunately a wealthy brother from the State of New York visited\nSketch of Experience 541\nWright after calling at Battle Creek and there learning that we had\nstarted out contrary to the opinion and advice of the church and those\nstanding at the head of the work at Battle Creek. He chose to repre-\nsent my husband, even before those for whom we had the greatest\nlabor, as being partially insane and his testimony consequently as of\nno weight. His influence in this matter, as stated to me by Brother\nRoot, the elder of the church, set the work back at least two weeks.\nI state this that unconsecrated persons may beware how they in their\nblind, unfeeling state cast an influence in an hour which may take\nthe worn servants of the Lord weeks to counteract. We were laboring\nfor persons of wealth, and Satan saw that this wealthy brother was\njust the man for him to use. May the Lord bring him where he can\nsee, and in humility of mind confess, his wrong. By two weeks more\nof the most wearing labor, with the blessing of God, we were able\nto remove this wrong influence and give that dear people full proof\nthat God had sent us to them. As a further result of our labors, seven\nwere soon after baptized by Brother Waggoner, and two in July by\nmy husband at the time of our second visit to that church.\nThe brother from New York returned with his wife and daughter [573]\nto Battle Creek, not in a state of mind to give a correct report of the\ngood work at Wright or to help the feelings of the church at Battle\nCreek. As facts have since come to light, it appears that he injured\nthe church, and the church injured him, in their mutual enjoyment\nfrom house to house in taking the most unfavorable views of our\ncourse and making it the theme of conversation. About the time this\ncruel work was going on, I had the following dream:\nI was visiting Battle Creek in company with a person of com-\nmanding manner and dignified deportment. In my dream I was\npassing around to the houses of our brethren. As we were about to\nenter, we heard voices engaged in earnest conversation. The name\nof my husband was frequently mentioned, and I was grieved and\nastonished to hear those who had professed to be our firmest friends\nrelating scenes and incidents which had occurred during the severe\naffliction of my husband, when his mental and physical powers were\npalsied to a great degree. I was grieved to hear the voice of the\nprofessed brother from New York before mentioned, relating in an\nearnest manner, and in an exaggerated light, incidents of which those\nat Battle Creek were ignorant, while our friends in Battle Creek, in\n542 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ntheir turn, related that which they knew. I became faint and sick\nat heart, and in my dream came near falling, when the hand of my\nattendant supported me, and he said: \u201cYou must listen. You must\nknow this even if it is hard to bear.\u201d\nAt the several houses we approached, the same subject was the\ntheme of conversation. It was their present truth. Said I: \u201cOh, I did\nnot know this! I was ignorant that such feelings existed in the hearts\nof those whom we have regarded as our friends in prosperity, and\nour fast friends in suffering, affliction, and adversity. Would I had\nnever known this! We have accounted these our very best and truest\nfriends.\u201d\nThe person with me repeated these words: \u201cIf they would only[574]\nengage as readily and with as much earnestness and zeal in conver-\nsation upon their Redeemer, dwelling upon His matchless charms,\nHis disinterested benevolence, and His merciful forgiveness, His\npitiful tenderness to the suffering, His forbearance and inexpressible\nlove, how much more precious and valuable would be the fruits.\u201d\nI then said: \u201cI am grieved. My husband has not spared himself\nto save souls. He stood under the burdens until they crushed him; he\nwas prostrated, broken physically and mentally; and now to gather\nup words and acts and use them to destroy his influence, after God\nhas put His hand under him to raise him up that his voice may again\nbe heard, is cruel and wicked.\u201d\nSaid the person who accompanied me: \u201cThe conversation where\nChrist and the characteristics of His life are the themes dwelt upon\nwill refresh the spirit and the fruit will be unto holiness and everlast-\ning life.\u201d He then quoted these words: \u201cWhatsoever things are true,\nwhatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever\nthings are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are\nof good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think\non these things.\u201d These words so impressed me that I spoke upon\nthem the next Sabbath.\nMy labors in Wright were very wearing. I had much care of\nmy husband by day, and sometimes in the night. I gave him baths,\nand took him out to ride, and twice a day, cold, stormy, or pleasant,\nwalked out with him. I used the pen while he dictated his reports\nfor the Review, and also wrote many letters, in addition to the many\npages of personal testimonies, and most of No. 11, besides visiting\nSketch of Experience 543\nand speaking as often and as long and earnestly as I did. Brother\nand Sister Root fully sympathized with me in my trials and labors,\nand watched with the tenderest care to supply all our wants. Our [575]\nprayers were frequent that the Lord would bless them in basket and\nin store, in health as well as in grace and spiritual strength. And\nI felt that a special blessing would follow them. Though sickness\nhas since come into their dwelling, yet I learn by Brother Root that\nthey now enjoy better health than before. And among the items of\ntemporal prosperity he reports that his wheat fields have produced\ntwenty-seven bushels to the acre, and some forty, while the average\nyield of his neighbors\u2019 fields has been only seven bushels per acre.\nJanuary 29, 1867, we left Wright, and rode to Greenville, Mont-\ncalm County, a distance of forty miles. It was the most severely\ncold day of the winter, and we were glad to find a shelter from the\ncold and storm at Brother Maynard\u2019s. This dear family welcomed\nus to their hearts and to their home. We remained in this vicinity six\nweeks, laboring with the churches at Greenville and Orleans, and\nmaking Brother Maynard\u2019s hospitable home our headquarters.\nThe Lord gave me freedom in speaking to the people; in every\neffort made I realized His sustaining power. And as I became fully\nconvinced that I had a testimony for the people, which I could bear\nto them in connection with the labors of my husband, my faith was\nstrengthened that he would yet be raised to health to labor with\nacceptance in the cause and work of God. His labors were received\nby the people, and he was a great help to me in the work. Without\nhim I could accomplish but little, but with his help, in the strength\nof God, I could do the work assigned me. The Lord sustained him\nin every effort which he put forth. As he ventured, trusting in God,\nregardless of his feebleness, he gained in strength and improved\nwith every effort. As I realized that my husband was regaining\nphysical and mental vigor, my gratitude was unbounded in view\nof the prospect that I should again be unfettered to engage anew [576]\nand more earnestly in the work of God, standing by the side of my\nhusband, we laboring unitedly in the closing work for God\u2019s people.\nPrevious to his being stricken down, the position he occupied in the\noffice confined him there the greater part of the time. And as I could\nnot travel without him I was necessarily kept at home much of the\ntime. I felt that God would now prosper him while he labored in\n544 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nword and doctrine, and devoted himself more especially to the work\nof preaching. Others could do the labor in the office, and we were\nsettled in our convictions that he would never again be confined,\nbut be free to travel with me that we both might bear the solemn\ntestimony which God had given us for His remnant people.\nI sensibly felt the low state of God\u2019s people, and every day I was\naware that I had gone to the extent of my strength. While in Wright\nwe had sent my manuscript for No. 11 to the office of publication,\nand I was improving almost every moment when out of meeting\nin writing out matter for No. 12. My energies, both physical and\nmental, had been severely taxed while laboring for the church in\nWright. I felt that I should have rest, but could see no opportunity\nfor relief. I was speaking to the people several times a week, and\nwriting many pages of personal testimonies. The burden of souls\nwas upon me, and the responsibilities I felt were so great that I could\nobtain but a few hours of sleep each night.\nWhile thus laboring in speaking and writing, I received letters\nof a discouraging character from Battle Creek. As I read them I\nfelt an inexpressible depression of spirits, amounting to agony of\nmind, which seemed for a short period to palsy my vital energies.\nFor three nights I scarcely slept at all. My thoughts were troubled\nand perplexed. I concealed my feelings as well as I could from\nmy husband and the sympathizing family with whom we were.\nNone knew my labor or burden of mind as I united with the family\nin morning and evening devotion, and sought to lay my burden[577]\nupon the great Burden Bearer. But my petitions came from a heart\nwrung with anguish, and my prayers were broken and disconnected\nbecause of uncontrollable grief. The blood rushed to my brain,\nfrequently causing me to reel and nearly fall. I had the nosebleed\noften, especially after making an effort to write. I was compelled to\nlay aside my writing, but could not throw off the burden of anxiety\nand responsibility upon me, as I realized that I had testimonies for\nothers which I was unable to present to them.\nI received still another letter, informing me that it was thought\nbest to defer the publication of No. 11 until I could write out that\nwhich I had been shown in regard to the Health Institute, as those in\ncharge of that enterprise stood in great want of means and needed\nthe influence of my testimony to move the brethren. I then wrote\nSketch of Experience 545\nout a portion of that which was shown me in regard to the Institute,\nbut could not get out the entire subject because of pressure of blood\nto the brain. Had I thought that No. 12 would be so long delayed, I\nshould not in any case have sent that portion of the matter contained\nin No. 11. I supposed that after resting a few days I could again\nresume my writing. But to my great grief I found that the condition\nof my brain made it impossible for me to write. The idea of writing\ntestimonies, either general or personal, was given up, and I was in\ncontinual distress because I could not write them.\nIn this state of things it was decided that we would return to\nBattle Creek and there remain while the roads were in a muddy,\nbroken-up condition, and that I would there complete No. 12. My\nhusband was very anxious to see his brethren at Battle Creek and\nspeak to them and rejoice with them in the work which God was\ndoing for him. I gathered up my writings, and we started on our\njourney. On the way we held two meetings in Orange and had\nevidence that the church was profited and encouraged. We were [578]\nourselves refreshed by the Spirit of the Lord. That night I dreamed\nthat I was in Battle Creek looking out from the side glass at the door\nand saw a company marching up to the house, two and two. They\nlooked stern and determined. I knew them well and turned to open\nthe parlor door to receive them, but thought I would look again. The\nscene was changed. The company now presented the appearance\nof a Catholic procession. One bore in his hand a cross, another a\nreed. And as they approached, the one carrying a reed made a circle\naround the house, saying three times: \u201cThis house is proscribed.\nThe goods must be confiscated. They have spoken against our holy\norder.\u201d Terror seized me, and I ran through the house, out of the\nnorth door, and found myself in the midst of a company, some of\nwhom I knew, but I dared not speak a word to them for fear of being\nbetrayed. I tried to seek a retired spot where I might weep and pray\nwithout meeting eager, inquisitive eyes wherever I turned. I repeated\nfrequently: \u201cIf I could only understand this! If they will tell me what\nI have said or what I have done!\u201d\nI wept and prayed much as I saw our goods confiscated. I tried\nto read sympathy or pity for me in the looks of those around me,\nand marked the countenances of several whom I thought would\nspeak to me and comfort me if they did not fear that they would\n546 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbe observed by others. I made one attempt to escape from the\ncrowd, but seeing that I was watched, I concealed my intentions.\nI commenced weeping aloud, and saying: \u201cIf they would only tell\nme what I have done or what I have said!\u201d My husband, who was\nsleeping in a bed in the same room, heard me weeping aloud and\nawoke me. My pillow was wet with tears, and a sad depression of\nspirits was upon me.\nBrother and Sister Howe accompanied us to West Windsor,\nwhere we were received and welcomed by Brother and Sister\nCarman. Sabbath and first day we met the brethren and sisters[579]\nfrom the churches in the vicinity and had freedom in bearing our\ntestimony to them. The refreshing Spirit of the Lord rested upon\nthose who felt a special interest in the work of God. Our conference\nmeetings were good, and nearly all bore testimony that they were\nstrengthened and greatly encouraged.\nIn a few days we found ourselves again at Battle Creek after\nan absence of about three months. On the Sabbath, March 16, my\nhusband delivered before the church the sermon on \u201cSanctification\u201d\nphonographically reported by the editor of the Review and published\nin V olume 29, No. 18. He also spoke with clearness in the afternoon\nand on first-day forenoon. I bore my testimony with usual freedom.\nSabbath, the 23d, we spoke with freedom to the church in Newton\nand labored with the church at Convis the following Sabbath and\nfirst day. We designed to return north and went thirty miles, but were\nobliged to turn back on account of the condition of the roads. My\nhusband was terribly disappointed at the cold reception which he met\nat Battle Creek, and I also was grieved. We decided that we could\nnot bear our testimony to this church till they gave better evidence\nthat they wished our services, and concluded to labor in Convis and\nMonterey till the roads should improve. The two following Sabbaths\nwe spent at Convis and have proof that a good work was done, as\nthe best of fruits are now seen.\nI came home to Battle Creek like a weary child who needed\ncomforting words and encouragement. It is painful for me here to\nstate that we were received with great coldness by our brethren, from\nwhom, three months before, I had parted in perfect union, excepting\non the point of our leaving home. The first night spent in Battle\nCreek, I dreamed that I had been laboring very hard and had been\nSketch of Experience 547\ntraveling for the purpose of attending a large meeting, and that I was\nvery weary. Sisters were arranging my hair and adjusting my dress, [580]\nand I fell asleep. When I awoke I was astonished and indignant to\nfind that my garments had been removed, and there had been placed\nupon me old rags, pieces of bedquilts knotted and sewed together.\nSaid I: \u201cWhat have you done to me? Who has done this shameful\nwork of removing my garments and replacing them with beggars\u2019\nrags?\u201d I tore off the rags and threw them from me. I was grieved,\nand with anguish cried out: \u201cBring me back my garments which I\nhave worn for twenty-three years and have not disgraced in a single\ninstance. Unless you give me back my garments I shall appeal to the\npeople, who will contribute and return me my own garments which\nI have worn twenty-three years.\u201d\nI have seen the fulfillment of this dream. At Battle Creek we met\nreports which had been put in circulation to injure us, but which had\nno foundation in truth. Letters had been written by some making a\ntemporary stay at the Health Institute, and by others living in Battle\nCreek, to churches in Michigan and other states, expressing fears,\ndoubts, and insinuations in regard to us. I was filled with grief as\nI listened to a charge from a fellow laborer whom I had respected,\nthat they were hearing from every quarter things which I had spoken\nagainst the church at Battle Creek. I was so grieved that I knew not\nwhat to say. We found a strong, accusing spirit against us. As we\nbecame fully convinced of the existing feelings we felt homesick.\nWe were so disappointed and distressed that I told two of our leading\nbrethren that I did not feel at home, as we met distrust and positive\ncoldness instead of welcome and encouragement, and that I had yet\nto learn that this was the course to pursue toward those who had\nbroken down among them by overexertion and devotion to the work\nof God. I then said that we thought we should move from Battle\nCreek and seek a more retired home.\nGrieved in spirit beyond measure, I remained at home, dreading [581]\nto go anywhere among the church for fear of being wounded. Finally,\nas no one made an effort to relieve my feelings, I felt it to be my duty\nto call together a number of experienced brethren and sisters, and\nmeet the reports which were circulating in regard to us. Weighed\ndown and depressed, even to anguish, I met the charges against me,\n548 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngiving a recital of my journey east, one year since, and the painful\ncircumstances attending that journey.\nI appealed to those present to judge whether my connection with\nthe work and cause of God would lead me to speak lightly of the\nchurch at Battle Creek, from whom I had not the slightest alienation\nof feeling. Was not my interest in the cause and work of God as\ngreat as it was possible for theirs to be? My whole experience and\nlife were interwoven with it. I had no separate interest aside from\nthe work. I had invested everything in this cause, and had considered\nno sacrifice too great for me to make in order to advance it. I had\nnot allowed affection for my loved babes to hold me back from\nperforming my duty as God required it in His cause. Maternal love\nthrobbed just as strongly in my heart as in the heart of any mother\nthat lived, yet I had separated from my nursing children and allowed\nanother to act the part of mother to them. I had given unmistakable\nevidences of my interest in, and devotion to, the cause of God. I\nhave shown by my works how dear it was to me. Could any produce\nstronger proof than myself? Were they zealous in the cause of truth?\nI more. Were they devoted to it? I could prove greater devotion\nthan anyone living engaged in the work. Had they suffered for the\ntruth\u2019s sake? I more. I had not counted my life dear unto me. I had\nnot shunned reproach, suffering, or hardships. When friends and\nrelatives had despaired of my life, because disease was preying upon\nme, I had been borne in my husband\u2019s arms to the boat or cars. At\none time, after traveling until midnight, we found ourselves in the\ncity of Boston without means. On two or three occasions we walked[582]\nby faith seven miles. We traveled as far as my strength would allow\nand then knelt on the ground and prayed for strength to proceed.\nStrength was given, and we were enabled to labor earnestly for the\ngood of souls. We allowed no obstacle to deter us from duty or\nseparate us from the work.\nThe spirit manifested in this meeting distressed me greatly. I\nreturned home still burdened, as those present made no effort to\nrelieve me by acknowledging that they were convinced that they had\nmisjudged me and that their suspicions and accusations against me\nwere unjust. They could not condemn me, neither did they make any\neffort to relieve me.\nSketch of Experience 549\nFor fifteen months my husband had been so feeble that he had\nnot carried his watch or purse, or driven his own team when riding\nout. But with the present year he had taken his watch and purse, the\nlatter empty in consequence of our great expenses, and had driven\nhis own team. He had, during his sickness, refused at different\ntimes to accept money from his brethren to the amount of nearly one\nthousand dollars, telling them that when he was in want he would\nlet them know it. We were at last brought to want. My husband felt\nit his duty, before becoming dependent, to first sell what we could\nspare. He had some few things at the office, and scattered among\nthe brethren in Battle Creek, of little value, which he collected and\nsold. We disposed of nearly one hundred and fifty dollars worth of\nfurniture. My husband tried to sell our sofa for the meetinghouse,\noffering to give ten dollars of its value, but could not. At this time\nour only and very valuable cow died. My husband then for the first\ntime felt that he could receive help, and addressed a note to a brother,\nstating that if the church would esteem it a pleasure to make up the\nloss of the cow they might do so. But nothing was done about it only\nto charge my husband with being insane on the subject of money.\nThe brethren knew him well enough to know that he would never ask [583]\nfor help unless driven to it by stern necessity. And now that he had\ndone it, judge of his feelings and mine when no notice was taken of\nthe matter only to use it to wound us in our want and deep affliction.\nAt this meeting my husband humbly confessed that he was wrong\nin several things of this nature, which he never should have done and\nnever would have done but for fear of his brethren and a desire to\nbe just right and in union with the church. This led those who were\ninjuring him to apparently despise him. We were humbled into the\nvery dust and distressed beyond expression. In this state of things we\nstarted to fill an appointment at Monterey. On the journey I suffered\nthe keenest anguish of spirit. I tried to explain to myself why it was\nthat our brethren did not understand in regard to our work. I had felt\nquite sure that when we should meet them they would know what\nspirit we were of, and that the Spirit of God in them would answer\nto the same in us, His humble servants, and there would be union\nof feeling and sentiment. Instead of this we were distrusted and\nsuspiciously watched, which was a cause of the greatest perplexity\nI ever experienced. As I was thus thinking, a portion of the vision\n550 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ngiven me at Rochester, December 25, 1865, came like a flash of\nlightning to my mind, and I immediately related it to my husband:\nI was shown a cluster of trees standing near together, forming a\ncircle. Running up over these trees was a vine which covered them\nat the top and rested upon them, forming an arbor. Soon I saw the\ntrees swaying to and fro, as though moved by a powerful wind. One\nbranch after another of the vine was shaken from its support until\nthe vine was shaken loose from the trees except a few tendrils which\nwere left clinging to the lower branches. A person then came up\nand severed the remaining clinging tendrils of the vine, and it lay\nprostrated upon the earth.\nThe distress and anguish of my mind as I saw the vine lying[584]\nupon the ground was beyond description. Many passed and looked\npityingly upon it, and I waited anxiously for a friendly hand to raise\nit; but no help was offered. I inquired why no hand raised the vine.\nPresently I saw an angel come to the apparently deserted vine. He\nspread out his arms and placed them beneath the vine and raised it\nso that it stood upright, saying: \u201cStand toward heaven, and let thy\ntendrils entwine about God. Thou art shaken from human support.\nThou canst stand, in the strength of God, and flourish without it.\nLean upon God alone, and thou shalt never lean in vain, or be shaken\ntherefrom.\u201d I felt inexpressible relief, amounting to joy, as I saw the\nneglected vine cared for. I turned to the angel and inquired what\nthese things meant. Said he: \u201cThou art this vine. All this thou\nwilt experience, and then, when these things occur, thou shalt fully\nunderstand the figure of the vine. God will be to thee a present help\nin time of trouble.\u201d From this time I was settled as to my duty and\nnever more free in bearing my testimony to the people. If I ever\nfelt the arm of the Lord holding me up, it was at that meeting. My\nhusband was also free and clear in his preaching, and the testimony\nof all was: We have had an excellent meeting.\nAfter we returned from Monterey, I felt it my duty to call another\nmeeting, as my brethren made no effort to relieve my feelings. I\ndecided to move forward in the strength of God and again express my\nfeelings and free myself from the suspicions and reports circulated\nto our injury. I bore my testimony and related things which had been\nshown me in the past history of some present, warning them of their\ndangers and reproving their wrong course of action. I stated that I\nSketch of Experience 551\nhad been placed in most disagreeable positions. When families and\nindividuals were brought before me in vision, it was frequently the\ncase that what was shown me in relation to them was of a private\nnature, reproving secret sins. I have labored with some for months\nin regard to wrongs of which others knew nothing. As my brethren\nsee these persons sad, and hear them express doubts in regard to [585]\ntheir acceptance with God, also feelings of despondency, they have\ncast censure upon me, as though I were to blame for their being\nin trial. Those who thus censured me were entirely ignorant of\nwhat they were talking about. I protested against persons\u2019 sitting as\ninquisitors upon my course of action. It has been the disagreeable\nwork assigned me to reprove private sins. Were I, in order to prevent\nsuspicions and jealousy, to give a full explanation of my course, and\nmake public that which should be kept private, I should sin against\nGod and wrong the individuals. I have to keep private reproofs of\nprivate wrongs to myself, locked in my own breast. Let others judge\nas they may, I will never betray the confidence reposed in me by the\nerring and repentant, or reveal to others that which should only be\nbrought before the ones that are guilty. I told those assembled that\nthey must take their hands off and leave me free to act in the fear of\nGod. I left the meeting relieved of a heavy burden.\n* * * * *\nChapter 103\u2014Laborers in the Office\nHere I will give two testimonies, one of them written March,\n1867, addressed to all engaged in the work at the Review office, the\nother addressed to the young who labor in the office. I am sorry to say\nthat all those warned have more or less disregarded these testimonies\nand now have to confess that they pursued a course contrary to that\npointed out by the testimonies. The first is as follows:\nWhile in Rochester, New York, December 25, 1865, I was shown\nsome things concerning those who are engaged in the work at the\noffice, also in regard to ministers whom God has called to labor in\nword and doctrine. Neither of these should engage in merchandise\nor traffic. They are called to a more sacred, elevated work, and it\nwould be impossible for them to do justice to the work and still carry[586]\non their traffic. Those engaged at the office should have no separate\ninterest. When they have given to the work that attention and care\nwhich it demands, they have done all they are able to do, and should\nnot be further taxed. If trafficking which has no connection with\nthe work of God engages the mind and occupies time, the work\nwill not be done thoroughly and well. At the best, those engaged in\nthe work have no physical or mental energy to spare. All are to a\ngreater or less degree enfeebled. Such a cause, such a sacred work,\nas that in which they are employed should engage the powers of the\nmind; they should not labor mechanically, but be sanctified to the\nwork and act as though the cause was a part of them, as though they\nhad invested something in this great and solemn work. Unless they\nthus take hold of this matter with interest, their efforts will not be\nacceptable to God.\nSatan is very artful, busy, and active. His special power is\nbrought to bear upon those who are now engaged in the work of\npreaching or publishing the present truth. All in connection with\nthis work need to keep on the whole armor, for they are the special\nmarks for Satan to attack. I saw that there is danger of becoming\nunguarded so that Satan will obtain an entrance and imperceptibly\n552\nLaborers in the Office 553\ndivert the mind from the great work. Those who fill responsible\npositions in the office are in danger of getting above the work and\nlosing humbleness of mind and the simplicity which has hitherto\ncharacterized the work.\nSatan had a special object in striking down one at the head of\nthe work who had a thorough experience in the rise and progress\nof present truth. He designed to get him out of the way, that he\nhimself might come in and imperceptibly affect minds that were not\nexperienced and thoroughly consecrated to the work. God designed\nto raise my husband to health after others had become acquainted\nwith the burdens he had borne and had felt some of the weariness [587]\nattending these burdens. At the same time they will never throw\ntheir whole soul, all the energies of mind and body, into the work\nand venture what he has ventured. It would never be their duty to\ndo as he has done, for they could not stand at their post should they\npass through a twentieth part of what he has endured.\nSatan designs to obtain a foothold in that office, and unless there\nis a united effort and thorough watchfulness, he will accomplish his\nobject. Some will get above the simplicity of the work and will feel\nthat they are sufficient when their strength is perfect weakness. God\nwill be glorified in this great work. And unless they cherish deep\nand constant humility and a firm trust in God, they will trust in self,\nindulge self-sufficiency, and one or more will drink the bitter cup\nof affliction. As the work increases, there is greater necessity for\nthorough trust in God and dependence upon Him and a thorough\ninterest in, and devotion to, the work. Selfish interests should be laid\naside. There should be much prayer, much meditation, for this is\nhighly necessary for the success and prosperity of the work. A spirit\nof traffic should not be allowed in anyone who is connected with\nthe office. If it is permitted, the work will be neglected and marred.\nCommon things will be placed too much upon a level with sacred\nthings.\nThere is great danger that some connected with the work will\nlabor merely for wages. They manifest no special interest in the\nwork, their heart is not in it, and they have no special sense of its\nsacred, exalted character. There is also special danger that those at\nthe head of the work will become lifted up, exalted, and that the\nwork of God will thus be marred, bearing the impress of the human\n554 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ninstead of the divine. Satan is wide awake and persevering, yet Jesus\nlives, and all who make Him their righteousness, their defense, will\nbe especially sustained.\nI was shown that Brethren A, B, and C were in danger of injuring[588]\ntheir health by remaining a considerable part of their time in heated\nrooms not sufficiently ventilated. These brethren need more physical\nexercise. Their employment is sedentary, and too much of the time\nthey breathe heated, impure air. Their lack of exercise causes a\ndepressed circulation, and they are in danger of injuring their health\npermanently by neglecting to heed the laws of their being. If they\nviolate these laws they will at some future period just as surely suffer\nthe penalty in some form as my husband has suffered it. They will\nbe sustained no more than was he. No one of them is capable of\nenduring even a small part of the physical and mental taxation which\nhe endured.\nThese brethren take the work with the heaviest battles fought,\nthe sorest trials passed through, to establish the cause in its present\nstanding. And yet a great and solemn work is before us, and it\ncalls for devotedness from them and also from Brother D, who is in\ndanger of exaltation. God will prove him and try him, and he must\nbe girded about with truth and have on the armor of righteousness,\nor he will fall by the hand of the enemy. All these brethren need to\nadhere most strictly and perseveringly to a healthful, spare diet, for\nall are in danger of congested brains, and paralysis may fell one or\nmore or all of them, if they continue living carelessly or recklessly.\nI saw that God had specially selected Brother B to engage in a\ngreat and exalted work. He would have cares and burdens, and yet\nall these could be so much more easily borne with true devotion and\nconsecration to the work. Brother B, you need a deeper draft from\nsalvation\u2019s fountain, a more thorough draft from the fountain of\nsanctification. Your will has not yet been fully submitted to the will\nof God. You move on because you think you cannot do otherwise;\nbut to walk in cheerful light because you can see that Christ Jesus\nleads the way before you, you have failed to do. Standing in the[589]\nresponsible place which you occupy, you have in all this hurt your\nown soul and influenced others. If you walk contrary to God, He\nwill walk contrary to you. God wants to use you, but you must die\nto self and sacrifice your pride. The Lord designs to use you in His\nLaborers in the Office 555\ncause if you will follow His opening providence and heartily and\nfully sanctify yourself and cleanse yourself from all filthiness of the\nflesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\n* * * * *\nThe following is the second testimony, written in May, 1867,\nand addressed to the young who were laboring in the office:\nDear Young Friends who are employed in the office of publica-\ntion at Battle Creek: A burden is resting upon me in regard to you.\nI have been repeatedly shown that all who are connected with the\nwork of God in publishing the present truth to be scattered to every\npart of the field should be Christians, not only in name, but in deed\nand in truth. Their object should not be merely to work for wages,\nbut all engaged in this great and solemn work should feel that their\ninterest is in the work, and that it is a part of them. Their motives\nand influence in connecting themselves with this great and solemn\nwork must bear the test of the judgment. None should be allowed\nto become connected with the office of publication who manifest\nselfishness and pride.\nI was shown that lightness and folly, joking and laughing, should\nnot be indulged by the workers in the office. Those engaged in the\nsolemn work of preparing truth to go to every part of the field should\nrealize that their deportment has its influence. If they are careless,\njesting, joking, and laughing while reading and preparing solemn\ntruth for publication, they show that their hearts are not in the work\nor sanctified through the truth. They do not discern sacred things,\nbut handle truth that is to test character, truth which is of heavenly [590]\norigin, as a common tale, as a story, merely to come before the mind\nand be readily effaced.\nWhile in Rochester I saw that we had everything to fear in regard\nto the office from a health standpoint; that not one connected with\nit realized the necessity of thorough ventilation. Their rooms were\noverheated, and the atmosphere was poisoned by impurities resulting\nfrom exhalations from the lungs, and other causes. It is impossible\nfor their minds to be in a healthy condition so as to be rightly\nimpressed by the pure and holy truths with which they have so much\n556 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto do, unless they place the proper value upon the pure, vitalizing\nair of heaven.\nI was shown that if those who are so closely connected with\nrevealed truth give no special evidence in their lives that they are\nmade better by the truth which is kept so constantly before them, if\ntheir lives do not testify to the fact that they are loving the truth and\nits sacred requirements more and more fervently, they are growing\nharder, and will be less and less affected by the truth and work of\nGod, until they find themselves destitute of the emotions of the Spirit\nof God, dead to the heavenly impress of truth. Eternal things will\nnot be discerned by them, but will be placed upon a low level with\ncommon things. This, I saw, had been the case with some connected\nwith the office, and all have been remiss in this respect to a greater\nor lesser degree.\nI saw that the work of present truth should engage the interest\nof all. The publication of truth is God\u2019s ordained plan as a means\nof warning, comforting, reproving, exhorting, or convicting all to\nwhose notice the silent, voiceless messengers may be brought. An-\ngels of God have a part to act in preparing hearts to be sanctified by\nthe truths published, that they may be prepared for the solemn scenes\nbefore them. None in that office are sufficient of themselves for the\nimportant work of discreetly managing matters connected with the\npublication of the truth. Angels must be near them to guide, to[591]\ncounsel, and to restrain, or the wisdom and folly of human agencies\nwill be apparent.\nI saw that angels were frequently in the office, in the folding\nroom, and in the room where the type is set. I was made to hear\nthe laughing, the jesting, the idle, foolish talking. Again, I saw\nthe vanity, the pride and selfishness exhibited. Angels looked sad\nand turned away grieved. The words I had heard, the vanity, pride,\nand selfishness exhibited, caused me to groan with anguish of spirit\nas angels left the room in disgust. Said an angel: \u201cThe heavenly\nmessengers came to bless, that the truth carried by the voiceless\npreachers might have a sanctifying, holy power to attend its mission;\nbut those engaged in this work were so distant from God, they\npossessed so little of the divine, and were so conformed to the\nspirit of the world, that the powers of darkness controlled them,\nand they could not be made susceptible of divine impressions.\u201d At\nLaborers in the Office 557\nthe same time these youth were deceived and thought they were\nrich and increased in goods and had need of nothing, and knew not\nthat they were poor and miserable, blind and naked. Those who\nhandle precious truth as they would sand know not how many times\ntheir heartless indifference to eternal things, their vanity, self-love,\nand pride, their laughing and senseless chatting, have driven the\nmessengers of heaven away from the office.\nIn deportment, words, and acts all in that office should be re-\nserved, modest, humble, and disinterested, as was their Pattern,\nJesus, the dear Saviour. They should seek God and obtain righteous-\nness. The office is not the place for sport, for visiting, for idlers, for\nlaughing or useless words. All should feel that they are doing a work\nfor their Master. These truths which they read, which they act their\npart to prepare to send out to the people, are invitations of mercy,\nare reproofs, threatenings, warnings, or encouragements. These are\ndoing their work as a savor of life unto life, or of death unto death.\nIf rejected, the judgment must decide the matter. The prayer of all [592]\nin the office should be: \u201cO God, make these truths, which are of\nsuch vital importance, clear to the comprehension of the humblest\nminds! May angels accompany these silent preachers and bless their\ninfluence, that souls may be saved by this humble means!\u201d\nThe heart should go out in fervent prayer while the hands are\nbusy, and Satan will not find such ready access, and the soul, instead\nof being lifted up unto vanity, will be constantly refreshed, will be\nlike a watered garden. Angels will delight to be near such work-\ners, for their presence will be continually encouraged by them. A\npower will attend the truths published. Divine rays of light from\nthe heavenly sanctuary will attend the precious truths sent forth, so\nthat those who read will be refreshed and strengthened, and souls\nthat are opposed to the truth will be convicted and compelled to say:\nThese things are so; they cannot be gainsaid.\nAll should feel that the office is a holy place, as sacred as the\nhouse of God. But God has been dishonored by the frivolity and\nlightness indulged by some connected with the work. I saw that\nstrangers from abroad often went away from the office disappointed.\nThey had associated it with everything sacred; but when they saw\nthe youth, or others connected with the office, possessing but little\ngravity, careless in words and acts, it caused them to doubt whether,\n558 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nafter all, this is really the work of God to prepare a people for\ntranslation to heaven.\nMay God bless this to all concerned.\n* * * * *\nChapter 104\u2014Conflicts and Victory\nExperiences from April 26, 1867 to October 20, 1867\nWe returned north, and on our way held a good meeting at West\nWindsor, and after reaching home held meetings at Fairplains and\nOrleans, and also gave some attention to the matter of building, [593]\nplanted our garden, and set out grapes, blackberries, raspberries, and\nstrawberries. Then in company with a good delegation we returned\nto the General Conference at Battle Creek.\nThe first Sabbath on our way we spent at Orleans and observed\nthe fast. It was a day of great solemnity with us; we sought to\nhumble ourselves before God, and with brokenness of spirit and\nmuch weeping we all prayed fervently that God would bless and\nstrengthen us to do His will at the Conference. We had some faith\nand hope that our captivity would be turned at that meeting.\nWhen we came to Battle Creek we found that our previous efforts\nhad not accomplished what we had hoped. Reports and jealousy\nstill existed. My soul was filled with intense anguish, and I wept\naloud for some hours, unable to restrain my grief. In conversation\na friend with whom I had been acquainted for twenty-two years\nrelated to me reports which he heard, that we were extravagant in\nexpending means. I inquired wherein we had been extravagant.\nHe mentioned the purchase of an expensive chair. I then related\nthe circumstances. My husband was greatly emaciated, and it was\nexceedingly wearisome and even painful for him to sit long in a\ncommon rocking chair, and for this reason he would lie down upon\nthe bed or lounge a great share of the time. I knew that this was no\nway for him to obtain strength and begged him to sit up more, but\nthe chair was an objection.\nOn my way east to attend the bedside of my dying father, I left\nmy husband at Brookfield, New York, and while at Utica looked for\na spring, sofa-seat chair. The dealers had none made at the price\nwhich I wished to pay, which was about fifteen dollars, but they\n559\n560 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\noffered me a very excellent chair, with rollers instead of rockers,\nprice thirty dollars, for seventeen. I knew that this was the chair in\nevery respect. But the brother with me urged me to wait to have\na chair made, which would cost only three dollars less. The chair[594]\noffered for seventeen dollars possessed the real value in itself; but I\nyielded to the judgment of another, waited to see the cheaper chair\nput together, paid for it myself, and had it carried to my husband. The\nreport concerning our extravagance in purchasing this chair I met\nin Wisconsin and Iowa. But who can condemn me? Had I the same\nto do over again, I would do as I did, with this exception: I would\nrely upon my own judgment, and purchase a chair costing a few\ndollars more, and worth double the one I got. Satan sometimes so\ninfluences minds as to destroy all feelings of mercy or compassion.\nThe iron seems to enter the heart, and both the human and the divine\ndisappear.\nReports also reached me that a sister had stated in Memphis and\nLapeer that the Battle Creek church had not the slightest confidence\nin Sister White\u2019s testimony. The question was asked if this referred\nto the written testimony. The answer was, No, not to her published\nvisions, but to the testimonies borne in meeting to the church, be-\ncause her life contradicts them. I again requested an interview with\na few select, experienced brethren and sisters, including the persons\nwho had circulated these things. I there requested that they would\nnow show me wherein my life had not been in accordance with\nmy teachings. If my life had been so inconsistent as to warrant the\nstatement that the church at Battle Creek had not the slightest confi-\ndence in my testimony, it could not be a difficult matter to present\nthe proofs of my unchristian course. They could produce nothing\nto justify the statements made, and they confessed that they were\nall wrong in the reports circulated, and that their suspicions and\njealousies were unfounded. I freely forgave those who had injured\nus, and told them that all I would ask on their part was to counteract\nthe influence they had exerted against us, and I would be satisfied.\nThey promised to do this, but have not done it.\nMany other reports against us, all either utterly false or greatly[595]\nexaggerated, were freely talked over in different families at the time\nof the Conference, and most looked upon us, especially my husband,\nwith suspicion. Some persons of influence manifested a disposition\nConflicts and Victory 561\nto crush us. We were in want, and my husband had tried to sell loose\nproperty, and he was thought to be wrong for this. He had stated his\nwillingness to have his brethren make up the loss of our cow, and\nthis was looked upon as a grievous sin. Supposing that our property\nat Battle Creek was as good as sold, we bought and began to build in\nGreenville. But we could not sell the Battle Creek property, and in\nour cramped position my husband wrote to different brethren to hire\nmoney. For this they condemned him and charged him with the sin\nof grasping for money. And the brother minister most active in this\nwork was heard to say: \u201cWe do not want Brother E to buy Brother\nWhite\u2019s place, for we want his money for the Health Institute.\u201d What\ncould we do? No way could we turn but we were blamed.\nOnly sixty-five hours before my husband was stricken down, he\nstood until midnight in a house of worship calling for three hundred\ndollars to finish paying for that house; and to give his call force he\nheaded the subscription with ten dollars for himself and the same for\nme. Before midnight the sum was nearly raised. The elder of that\nchurch was an old friend, and in our extreme want and friendless\ncondition my husband wrote to him, stating that we were in want,\nand if that church now wished to return the twenty dollars we would\nreceive it. At the time of the Conference this brother called on us\nand made the matter a serious wrong. But before he came to our\nhouse he had taken some stock at least in the general infection. We\nfelt these things most keenly, and if we had not been especially\nsustained by the Lord we could not have borne our testimony at the\nConference with any degree of freedom.\nBefore we returned from the Conference, Brethren Andrews, [596]\nPierce, and Bourdeau had a special season of prayer at our house, in\nwhich we were all greatly blessed, especially my husband. This gave\nhim courage to return to our new home. And then commenced his\nkeen sufferings from his teeth, also our labors reported in theReview.\nHe stopped preaching only one week in his toothless condition, but\nlabored at Orange and Wright, with the church at home, at Greenbush\nand Bushnell, preaching and baptizing as before.\nAfter returning from the Conference, a great uncertainty came\nupon me in relation to the prosperity of the cause of God. Doubts\nexisted in my mind where none had been six months before. I viewed\nGod\u2019s people as partaking of the spirit of the world, imitating its\n562 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfashions, and getting above the simplicity of our faith. It seemed that\nthe church at Battle Creek were backsliding from God, and it was\nimpossible to arouse their sensibilities. The testimonies given me\nof God had the least influence and were the least heeded in Battle\nCreek of any part of the field. I trembled for the cause of God. I\nknew that the Lord had not forsaken His people, but that their sins\nand iniquities had separated them from God. At Battle Creek is the\ngreat heart of the work. Every pulsation is felt by the members of\nthe body all over the field. If this great heart is in health, a vital\ncirculation will be felt all through the body of Sabbathkeepers. If\nthe heart is diseased, the languishing condition of every branch of\nthe work will attest the fact.\nMy interest is in this work; my life is interwoven with it. When\nZion prospers, I am happy; if she languishes, I am sad, desponding,\ndiscouraged. I saw that God\u2019s people were in an alarming condition,\nand His favor was being removed from them. I pondered upon this\nsad picture day and night, and pleaded in bitter anguish: \u201cO Lord,\ngive not Thine heritage to reproach. Let not the heathen say, Where\nis their God?\u201d I felt that I was cut loose from everyone at the head of\nthe work and was virtually standing alone. I dared not trust anyone.[597]\nIn the night I have awakened my husband, saying: \u201cI am afraid that\nI shall become an infidel.\u201d Then I would cry for the Lord to save\nme by His own powerful arm. I could not see that my testimonies\nwere regarded, and I entertained the thought that perhaps my work\nin the cause was done. We had appointments at Bushnell, but I told\nmy husband that I could not go. He soon returned from the post\noffice with a letter from Brother Matteson, containing the following\ndream:\n\u201cDear Brother White: May the blessing of God be with you, and\nthese lines find you still prospering and improving in health and\nspiritual strength. I feel very thankful to the Lord for His goodness\nto you, and trust that you may yet enjoy perfect health and freedom\nin the proclamation of the last message.\n\u201cI have had a remarkable dream about you and Sister White, and\nfeel it my duty to relate the same to you as far as I can remember. I\ndreamed that I related it to Sister White, as well as the interpretation\nthereof, which also was given me in the dream. When I awoke,\nsomething urged me to get up and write down all the particulars, lest\nConflicts and Victory 563\nI should forget them; but I neglected to do so, partly because I was\ntired, and partly because I thought it was nothing but a dream. But\nseeing that I never dreamed of you before, and that this dream was\nso intelligent, and so intimately connected with you, I have come\nto the conclusion that I ought to tell you. The following is all I can\nremember of it:\n\u201cI was in a large house where there was a pulpit somewhat like\nthose we use in our meetinghouses. On it stood many lamps which\nwere burning. These lamps needed a constant supply of oil, and\nquite a number of us were engaged in carrying oil and filling them.\nBrother White and his companion were busily engaged, and I noticed\nthat Sister White poured in more oil than any other. Then Brother\nWhite went to a door which opened into a warehouse, where there\nwere many barrels of oil. He opened the door and went in, and Sister [598]\nWhite followed. Just then a company of men came along, with a\ngreat quantity of black stuff that looked like soot, and heaped it all\nupon Brother and Sister White, completely covering them with it.\nI felt much grieved, and looked anxiously to see the end of these\nthings. I could see Brother and Sister W. both working hard to get\nout from under the soot, and after a long struggle they came out\nas bright as ever, and the evil men and the soot disappeared. Then\nBrother and Sister White engaged again more heartily than ever in\nsupplying the lamps with oil, but Sister W. still had the precedence.\n\u201cI dreamed that the following was the interpretation: The lamps\nrepresented the remnant people. The oil was the truth and heavenly\nlove, of which God\u2019s people need a constant supply. The people\nengaged in supplying the lamps were the servants of God laboring\nin the harvest. Who the evil company were in particular I could not\ntell, but they were men moved upon by the devil, who directed their\nevil influence specially against Brother and Sister White. The latter\nwere in great distress for a season, but were at last delivered by the\ngrace of God and their own earnest efforts. Then finally the power\nof God rested upon them, and they acted a prominent part in the\nproclamation of the last message of mercy. But Sister White had a\nricher supply of heavenly wisdom and love than the rest.\n\u201cThis dream has rather strengthened my confidence that the Lord\nwill lead you out and finish the work of restoration that is begun, and\nthat you will once more enjoy the spirit of God as you did in times\n564 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\npast, yea, more abundantly. Forget not that humility is the door that\nleads to the rich supplies of the grace of God. may the Lord bless\nyou and your companion and children, and grant us to meet in the\nheavenly kingdom. Yours in bonds of Christian love.\n\u201cJohn Matteson.\n\u201cOakland, Wisconsin,\nJuly 15, 1867.\u201d\nThis dream gave me some encouragement. I had confidence in[599]\nBrother Matteson. Before I saw him with my natural eyes, his case\nwas shown me in vision, in contrast with that of F of Wisconsin.\nThe latter was utterly unworthy to bear the name of Christian, much\nmore to be a messenger; but Brother Matteson was shown me as one\nwho possessed humility, and who, if he maintained his consecration,\nwould be qualified to point souls to the Lamb of God. Brother\nMatteson had no knowledge of my trials of mind. Not a line had\never passed between us, and the dream coming when and from whom\nit did, looked to me like the hand of God reached forth to help me.\nWe had the care of building with hired money, which caused\nperplexity. We kept up our appointments and labored extremely hard\nall through the hot weather. For want of means we went into the\nfield together, hoeing, and cutting and raking hay. I took the fork\nand built the stack, while my husband, with his feeble arms, pitched\nthe hay to me. I took the brush and painted the inside of much of our\nhouse. In these things we both wearied ourselves too much. Finally\nI suddenly failed and could do no more. For several mornings I\nfainted, and my husband had to attend the Greenbush grove meeting\nwithout me.\nOur old, hard-riding carriage had been well-nigh killing us and\nour team. Long journeyings with it, the labor of meetings, home\ncares and labors, were too much for us, and I feared that my work\nwas done. My husband tried to encourage me and urged me to start\nout again to fill our appointments at Orange, Greenbush, and Ithaca.\nFinally I resolved to start, and, if I was no worse, continue the\njourney. I rode ten miles kneeling in the carriage on a cushion and\nConflicts and Victory 565\nleaning my head upon another in my husband\u2019s lap. He drove and\nsupported me. The next morning I was some better and decided to\ngo on. God helped us to speak in power to the people at Orange, and\na glorious work was done for backsliders and sinners. At Greenbush\nI had freedom and strength given me. At Ithaca the Lord helped us [600]\nto speak to a large congregation whom we had never met before.\nIn our absence, Brethren King, Fargo, and Maynard decided that\nin mercy to ourselves and team we should have a light, comfortable\ncarriage; so on our return they took my husband to Ionia and pur-\nchased the one we now have. This was just what we needed and\nwould have saved me much weariness in traveling in the heat of\nsummer.\nAt this time we received earnest requests to attend the convoca-\ntion meetings in the West. As we read these touching appeals we\nwept over them. My husband would say to me, \u201cEllen, we cannot\nattend these meetings. At best I could hardly take care of myself\non such a journey, and should you faint, what could I do? But,\nEllen, we must go;\u201d and as he would thus speak, his tearful emotions\nwould choke his utterance. In return, while pondering on our feeble\ncondition, and the state of the cause in the West, and feeling that the\nbrethren needed our labors, I would say: \u201cJames, we cannot attend\nthese meetings in the West\u2014but we must go.\u201d At this point, several\nof our faithful brethren, seeing our condition, offered to go with us.\nThis was enough to decide the matter. In our new carriage we left\nGreenville August 29 to attend the general gathering at Wright. Four\nteams followed us. The journey was a comfortable one and very\npleasant in company with sympathizing brethren. The meeting was\none of victory.\nSeptember 7 and 8 we enjoyed a precious season at Monterey\nwith the brethren of Allegan County. Here we met Brother Lough-\nborough, who had begun to feel the wrongs existing in Battle Creek\nand was mourning over the part he had acted in connection with\nthese wrongs, which had injured the cause and brought cruel burdens\nupon us. By our request he accompanied us to Battle Creek. But\nbefore we left Monterey, he related to us the following dream:\n\u201cWhen Brother and Sister White came to Monterey, September [601]\n7, they requested me to accompany them to Battle Creek. I hesitated\nabout going, thinking that it might be duty to still follow up the\n566 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ninterest in Monterey and thinking, as I expressed to them, that there\nwas but little opposition to them in Battle Creek. After praying over\nthe matter several days, I retired one evening anxiously soliciting\nthe Lord for light in the matter.\n\u201cI dreamed that I, with a number of others, members of the Battle\nCreek Church, was on board a train of cars. The cars were low\u2014I\ncould hardly stand erect in them. They were ill-ventilated, having\nan odor as though they had not been ventilated for months. The road\nover which they were passing was very rough, and the cars shook\nabout at a furious rate, sometimes causing our baggage to fall off,\nand sometimes throwing off some of the passengers. We had to keep\nstopping to get on our passengers and baggage, or repair the track.\nWe seemed to work some time and to make little or no headway. We\nwere indeed a sorry-looking set of travelers.\n\u201cAll at once we came to a turntable, large enough to take on the\nwhole train. Brother and Sister White were standing there and, as\nI stepped off the train, they said: \u2018this train is going all wrong. It\nmust be turned square about.\u2019 They both laid hold of cranks that\nmoved the machinery turning the table and tugged with all their\nmight. Never did men work harder propelling a handcar than they\ndid at the cranks of the turntable. I stood and watched till I saw the\ntrain beginning to turn, when I spoke out and said, \u2018it moves,\u2019 and\nlaid hold to help them. I paid but little attention to the train, we were\nso intent upon performing our labor of turning the table.\n\u201cWhen we had accomplished this task, we looked up, and the\nwhole train was transformed. Instead of the low, ill-ventilated cars\non which we had been riding, there were broad, high, well-ventilated\ncars, with large, clear windows, the whole trimmed and gilded in a\nmost splendid manner, more elegant than any palace or hotel car I[602]\never saw. The track was level, smooth, and firm. The train was filling\nup with passengers whose countenances were cheerful and happy,\nyet wore an expression of assurance and solemnity. All seemed\nto express the greatest satisfaction at the change which had been\nwrought, and the greatest confidence in the successful passage of\nthe train. Brother and sister white were on board this time, their\ncountenances lit up with holy joy. As the train was starting, I was so\noverjoyed that I awoke, with the impression on my mind that that\ndream referred to the church at battle creek and matters connected\nConflicts and Victory 567\nwith the cause there. My mind was perfectly clear in regard to my\nduty to go to Battle Creek and lend a helping hand in the work\nthere. Glad am I now that I have been here to see the blessing of the\nLord accompanying the arduous labors of brother and sister white\nin setting things in order.\n\u201cJ. N. Loughborough.\u201d\nBefore we left Monterey, Brother Loughborough handed me the\nfollowing account of another dream which he had about the time of\nthe death of his wife. This was also a matter of encouragement to\nme.\n\u201c\u2018The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream.\u2019 Jeremiah\n23:28.\n\u201cOne evening, after meditating upon the afflictions of Brother\nand Sister White, their connection with the work of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, and my own failure to stand by them in their affliction;\nand after trying to confess my wrongs to the Lord, and imploring\nhis blessing upon Brother and Sister White, I retired to rest.\n\u201cI thought in my dream that I was in my native town, at the foot\nof a long sidehill. I spoke with considerable earnestness and said:\n\u2018Oh, that I might find that all-healing fountain!\u2019 I thought a beautiful,\nwell-dressed young man came along and said very pleasantly: \u2018I\nwill conduct you to the spring.\u2019 He led the way, and I tried to follow.\nWe went along the hillside, passing with much difficulty three wet [603]\nboggy places, through which small streams of muddy water were\nflowing. There was no way to cross these only by wading. Having\naccomplished this, we came to nice, hard ground and a place where\nthere was a jog in the bank, and a large spring of the purest sparkling\nwater was boiling up. A large vat was placed there, very much like\nthe plunge tub at the Health Institute at Battle Creek. A pipe was\nrunning from the spring into one end of the vat, and the water was\noverflowing at the other. The sun was shining brightly, and the water\nsparkled in its rays.\n\u201cAs we approached the spring, the young man said nothing, but\nlooked toward me and smiled with an expression of satisfaction,\nand waved one hand toward the spring, as much as to say: \u2018don\u2019t\nyou think that is an all-healing spring?\u2019 Quite a large company of\n568 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\npersons, with Brother and Sister White at their head, came up to the\nspring on the opposite side from us. They all looked pleasant and\ncheerful, yet a holy solemnity seemed to be on their countenances.\n\u201cBrother White seemed greatly improved in health, and was\ncheerful and happy, but looked tired as though he had been walking\nsome distance. Sister White had a large cup in her hand, which she\ndipped into the spring, drinking of the water, and then passing it to\nthe others. I thought that brother white was addressing the company\nand saying to them: \u2018now you will have a chance to see the effects of\nthis water.\u2019 He then drank, and it instantly revived him, as it did all\nothers who drank of it, causing a look of vigor and strength in their\ncountenances. I thought that while brother white was talking and\ntaking now and then a draft of water, he placed his hands on the side\nof the vat and plunged in three times. Every time he came up he was\nstronger than before, but he kept talking all the while and exhorting\nothers to come and bathe in \u2018the fountain,\u2019 as he then called it, and\ndrink of its healing stream. His voice, as well as that of Sister White,\nseemed melodious. I felt a spirit of rejoicing that I had found the\nspring. Sister White was coming toward me with a cup of the water[604]\nfor me to drink, but I was so rejoiced that I awoke before I drank of\nthe water.\n\u201cThe Lord grant that I may drink largely of that water, for I\nbelieve that it is none other than that of which Christ spoke, which\nwill \u2018spring up unto everlasting life.\u2019\n\u201cJ.N. Loughborough.\n\u201cMonterey, Michigan,\nSeptember 8, 1867.\u201d\nSeptember 14 and 15 we held profitable meetings at Battle Creek.\nHere my husband with freedom struck a bold blow at some sins of\nthose who stand in high places in the cause, and for the first time in\ntwenty months he attended evening meetings and preached evenings.\nA good work was begun, and the church, as published in theReview,\ngave us the pledge to stand by us, if on our return from the West we\nwould continue our labors with them.\nConflicts and Victory 569\nIn company with Brother and Sister Maynard, and Brethren\nSmith and Olmstead, we attended the large Western meetings, the\nprincipal victories of which have been fully given in the Review.\nWhile attending the meetings in Wisconsin, I was quite feeble. I had\nlabored far beyond my strength at Battle Creek and nearly fainted in\nthe cars on the journey. I had for four weeks suffered much with my\nlungs, and it was with difficulty that I spoke to the people. Sabbath\nevening a fomentation was applied over my throat and lungs; but the\nhead cap was forgotten, and the difficulty of the lungs was driven to\nthe brain. As I arose in the morning, I felt a singular sensation upon\nthe brain. V oices seemed to vibrate, and everything appeared to be\nswinging before me. As I walked, I reeled and came near falling to\nthe floor. I took my breakfast, hoping to be relieved by so doing; but\nthe difficulty only increased. I grew very sick and could not sit up.\nMy husband came to the house after the forenoon meeting, say-\ning that he had given an appointment for me to speak in the afternoon. [605]\nIt seemed impossible for me to stand before the people. When my\nhusband asked what subject I would speak upon, I could not gather\nor retain a sentence in my mind. But I thought: If God will have me\nspeak, He will surely strengthen me; I will venture by faith; I can\nbut fail. I staggered to the tent with a strangely confused brain, but\ntold the preaching brethren on the stand that if they would sustain\nme by their prayers, I would speak. I stood before the people in\nfaith, and in about five minutes my head and lungs were relieved,\nand without difficulty I spoke more than one hour to fifteen hundred\neager listeners. After I ceased speaking, a sense of the goodness and\nmercy of God came over me, and I could not forbear rising again and\nrelating my sickness and the blessing of God which had sustained\nme while speaking. Since that meeting my lungs have been greatly\nrelieved, and I have been improving in health.\nIn the West we met reports amounting to little less than slander\nagainst my husband. These were current at the time of the General\nConference, and were carried to all parts of the field. I will state one\nas a sample. It was said that my husband was so crazy for money\nthat he had engaged in selling old bottles. The facts are these: When\nwe were about to move, I asked my husband what we should do with\na lot of old bottles on hand. Said he: \u201cThrow them away.\u201d Just then\nour Willie came in and offered to clean and sell them. I told him to\n570 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndo so, and he should have what he could get for them. And when\nmy husband rode to the post office, he took Willie and the bottles\ninto the carriage. He could do no less for his own faithful little son.\nWillie sold the bottles and took the money. On their way to the post\noffice my husband took a brother connected with the Review office\ninto the carriage, who conversed pleasantly with him as they rode to\nand from town, and because he saw Willie come out to the carriage\nand ask his father a question relative to the value of the bottles, and\nthen saw the druggist in conversation with my husband relative to\nthat which so much interested Willie, this brother, without saying[606]\none word to my husband about the matter, immediately reported that\nBrother White had been downtown selling old bottles and therefore\nmust be crazy. The first we heard about the bottles was in Iowa, five\nmonths after.\nThese things have been kept from us so that we could not correct\nthem, and have been carried, as on the wings of the wind, by our pro-\nfessed friends. And we have been astonished to find, by investigation\nand by recent confessions from nearly all the members of this church,\nthat some one or more of the false reports have been fully credited by\nnearly all and that those professed Christians have cherished feelings\nof censure, bitterness, and cruelty against us, especially against my\nfeeble husband who is struggling for life and liberty. Some have had\na wicked, crushing spirit and have represented him as wealthy yet\ngrasping for money.\nUpon returning to Battle Creek, my husband called for a council\nof brethren to meet with the church that matters might be investigated\nbefore them and false reports met. Brethren came from different\nparts of the state, and my husband fearlessly called on all to bring\nwhat they could against him that he might meet it openly and thus\nput an end to this private slander. The wrongs which he had before\nconfessed in the Review he now fully confessed in a public meeting\nand to individuals, and also explained many matters upon which\nfalse and foolish charges were based, and convinced all of the falsity\nof those charges.\nAnd while looking up matters relative to the real value of our\nproperty, we found to his astonishment, and that of all present, that\nit amounted to only $1,500, besides his horses and carriage, and\nremnants of editions of books and charts, the sale of which for the\nConflicts and Victory 571\npast year, as stated by the secretary, has not been equal to the interest\non the money he owes to the Publishing Association. These books\nand charts cannot at present be regarded of much value, and certainly [607]\nnot to us in our present condition.\nWhen in health, my husband had no time to keep accounts, and\nduring his sickness his matters were in the hands of others. The\ninquiry arose: What had become of his property? Had he been\ndefrauded? Had mistakes been made in his accounts? Or had he,\nin the unsettled condition of his affairs, given to this and that good\nobject, not knowing his real ability to give and not knowing how\nmuch he gave?\nAs one good result of the investigation, confidence in those who\nhave had charge of accounts relative to our affairs is unshaken, and\nwe have no good reason to conclude that our limited means can be\nattributed to errors in the accounts. Therefore in looking over my\nhusband\u2019s business matters for ten years, and his liberal manner of\nhanding out means to help the work in all its branches, the best and\nmost charitable conclusion is that our property has been used in the\ncause of present truth. My husband has kept no accounts, and what\nhe has given can be traced only from memory and from what has\nbeen receipted in the Review. The fact that we are worth so little,\nappearing at this time when my husband has been represented as\nwealthy and still grasping for more, has been a matter of rejoicing to\nus, as it is the best refutation of the false charges which threatened\nour influence and Christian character.\nOur property may go, and we will still rejoice in God if it be used\nfor the advancement of His cause. We have cheerfully spent the best\nof our days, the best of our strength, and have nearly worn out in the\nsame cause, and feel the infirmities of premature age, and yet we\nwill rejoice. But when our professed brethren attack our character\nand influence by representing us as wealthy, worldly, and grasping\nfor more, it is then that we feel keenly. Let us enjoy the character\nand influence we have dearly earned during the past twenty years,\nwith even poverty and a slight hold on health and this mortal life, [608]\nand we will rejoice and cheerfully give to the cause the little there is\nleft of us.\nThe investigation was a thorough one and resulted in freeing us\nfrom the charges brought against us, and restoring feelings of perfect\n572 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nunion. Hearty and heart-rending confessions of the cruel course\npursued toward us here have been made, and the signal blessing\nof God has come upon us all. Backsliders have been reclaimed,\nsinners have been converted, and forty-four have been buried in\nbaptism, my husband baptizing sixteen, and Brethren Andrews and\nLoughborough, twenty-eight. We are encouraged, yet much worn.\nMy husband and myself have had the burden of the work, which\nhas been very laborious and exciting. How we have, in our feeble\nstate, gone through with the investigation, with the feelings of nearly\nall against us, endured the preaching, the exhortations, and the late\nevening meetings, and at the same time prepared this work, my\nhusband working with me, copying and preparing it for the printers,\nand reading proof, God only knows. Yet we have passed through it\nand hope in God that He will sustain us in our future labors.\nWe now believe that much in the foregoing dreams was given to\nillustrate our trials arising from wrongs existing at Battle Creek, our\nlabors in clearing ourselves from cruel charges, and also our labors,\nwith the blessing of God, in setting things right. If this view of the\ndreams be correct, may we not hope, from other portions of them\nnot yet fulfilled, that our future will be more favorable than the past?\nIn concluding this narrative, I would say that we are living in\na most solemn time. In the last vision given me, I was shown the\nstartling fact that but a small portion of those who now profess the\ntruth will be sanctified by it and be saved. Many will get above the\nsimplicity of the work. They will conform to the world, cherish\nidols, and become spiritually dead. The humble, self-sacrificing[609]\nfollowers of Jesus will pass on to perfection, leaving behind the\nindifferent and lovers of the world.\nI was pointed back to ancient Israel. But two of the adults of the\nvast army that left Egypt entered the land of Canaan. Their dead\nbodies were strewn in the wilderness because of their transgressions.\nModern Israel are in greater danger of forgetting God and being led\ninto idolatry than were His ancient people. Many idols are wor-\nshiped, even by professed Sabbathkeepers. God especially charged\nHis ancient people to guard against idolatry, for if they should be led\naway from serving the living God, His curse would rest upon them,\nwhile if they would love Him with all their heart, with all their soul,\nConflicts and Victory 573\nand with all their might, He would abundantly bless them in basket\nand in store, and would remove sickness from the midst of them.\nA blessing or a curse is now before the people of God\u2014a blessing\nif they come out from the world and are separate, and walk in the path\nof humble obedience; and a curse if they unite with the idolatrous,\nwho trample upon the high claims of heaven. The sins and iniquities\nof rebellious Israel are recorded and the picture presented before us\nas a warning that if we imitate their example of transgression and\ndepart from God we shall fall as surely as did they. \u201cNow all these\nthings happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for\nour admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 105\u2014Response From Battle Creek Church\nWe esteem it a privilege as well as a duty to respond to the\nforegoing statements of Sister White. We have been favored with an\nacquaintance of many years with the labors of these servants of the\nLord [Brother and Sister White]. We have known something of their[610]\nsacrifices in the past, and have been witnesses of the blessing of God\nthat has attended their plain, searching, faithful testimony. We have\nlong been convinced that the teachings of the Holy Spirit in these\nvisions were indispensable to the welfare of the people who are\npreparing for translation into the kingdom of God. In no other way\ncan secret sins be rebuked and base men who creep \u201cin unawares\u201d\ninto the flock of God be exposed and baffled in their evil designs.\nLong experience has taught us that such a gift is of inestimable value\nto the people of God. We believe also that God has called Brother\nWhite to bear a plain testimony in reproving wrongs thus made\nmanifest, and that in this work he should have the support of those\nwho truly fear God.\nWe have learned by painful experience, also, that when these\ntestimonies are silent, or their warning lightly regarded, coldness,\nbacksliding, worldly-mindedness, and spiritual darkness take pos-\nsession of the church. We would not give glory to man, but we\nshould be recreant to our sense of duty not to speak in strong and\npointed language our views of the importance of these testimonies.\nThe fearful apostasy of those who have slighted and despised them\nhas furnished many sad proofs of the dangerous business of doing\ndespite to the Spirit of grace.\nWe have been witnesses of the great affliction through which\nBrother and Sister White have passed in the severe and dangerous\nsickness of Brother White. The hand of God in his restoration is to\nus most apparent. Probably no other one upon whom such a blow\nhas fallen ever recovered. Yet a severe shock of paralysis, seriously\naffecting the brain, has, by the good hand of God, been removed\n574\nResponse From Battle Creek Church 575\nfrom his servant, and new strength granted him both in body and\nmind.\nWe think that the action of Sister White in taking her sick hus-\nband on her northern tour, in December last, was dictated by the\nSpirit of God; and that we, in standing opposed to such action, did [611]\nnot move in the counsel of God. We lacked heavenly wisdom in\nthis matter and thus erred from the right path. We acknowledge\nourselves to have been, at this time, lacking in that deep Christian\nsympathy that was called for by such great affliction, and that we\nhave been too slow to see the hand of God in the recovery of Brother\nWhite. His labors and sufferings in our behalf entitled him to our\nwarmest sympathy and support. But we have been blinded by Satan\nin respect to our own spiritual condition.\nA spirit of prejudice respecting means came over us during the\npast winter, causing us to feel that Brother W. was asking for means\nwhen he did not need it. We now ascertain that at this very time he\nwas really in want, and we were wrong in that we did not inquire\ninto the case as we should. We acknowledge that this feeling was\nunfounded and cruel, though it was caused by misapprehension of\nthe facts in the case.\nWe now accept with deep sorrow of heart the reproof given us in\nthis testimony, and we ask that wherein we have erred from the right,\nthrough our lack of spiritual discernment, we may find forgiveness\nof God and of His people.\nThe labors of Brother and Sister White with us for a few days\npast have been attended with the signal blessing of God. Not only\nhave deep and heartfelt confessions of backsliding and wrong been\nmade, but solemn vows of repentance and of returning to God have\naccompanied them. The Spirit of God has set its seal to this work\nin such a manner that we cannot doubt. Many of the young have\nbeen brought to Christ, and nearly every person connected with this\nchurch has received a share of this heavenly blessing.\nLet our brethren abroad understand that our hearts are in sympa-\nthy with Brother and Sister White, and that we believe them called\nof God to the responsible work in which they are engaged, and that\nwe pledge ourselves to stand by them in this work.\nIn behalf of the church, [612]\n576 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nJ.N. Andrews,\nJ.N. Loughborough,\nJoseph Bates,\nD.T. Bourdeau,\nA.S. Hutchins,\nJohn Byington,\nCommittee.\nAt a meeting of the church, Monday evening, October 21, the\nforegoing report was unanimously adopted.\nUriah Smith,\nG.W. Amadon,\nElders.\nChapter 106\u2014Cutting and Slashing\n\u201cCutting and Slashing\u201d This expression is often used to repre-\nsent the manners and words of persons who reprove those who are\nwrong or are supposed to be wrong. It is properly applied to those\nwho have no duty to reprove their brethren, yet are ready to engage\nin this work in a rash and unsparing manner. It is improperly applied\nto those who have a special duty to do in reproving wrongs in the\nchurch. Such have the burden of the work and feel compelled, from\na love of precious souls, to deal faithfully.\nFrom time to time for the past twenty years I have been shown\nthat the Lord had qualified my husband for the work of faithfully\ndealing with the erring, and had laid the burden upon him, and\nthat if he should fail to do his duty in this respect he would incur\nthe displeasure of the Lord. I have never regarded his judgment\ninfallible, nor his words inspired; but I have ever believed him better\nqualified for this work than any other one of our preachers, because\nof his long experience, and because I have seen that he was especially\ncalled and adapted to the work; and also because in many cases [613]\nwhere persons have risen up against his reproofs, I have been shown\nthat he was right in his judgment of matters and in his manner of\nreproving.\nFor the past twenty years those who have been reproved, and\ntheir sympathizers, have indulged an accusing spirit toward my\nhusband, which has worn upon him more than any other one of the\ncruel burdens he has unjustly borne. And when he fell beneath his\nburdens, many of those who had been reproved rejoiced, and from\na mistaken idea of my view of his case, December 25, 1865, were\nmuch comforted with the thought that the Lord at that time reproved\nhim for \u201ccutting and slashing.\u201d This is all a mistake. I saw no such\nthing. That my brethren may know what I did see in the case of my\nhusband, I give the following, which I wrote and handed to him the\nnext day after I had the vision:\n577\n578 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI was shown in vision, December 25, 1865, the case of the\nservant of the Lord, my husband, Elder James White. I was shown\nthat God had accepted his humiliation, and the afflicting of his soul\nbefore Him, and his confessions of his lack of consecration to God,\nand his repentance for the errors and mistakes in his course which\nhave caused him such sorrow and despondency of mind during his\nprotracted illness.\nI was shown that his greatest wrong in the past has been an un-\nforgiving spirit toward those brethren who have injured his influence\nin the cause of God and brought upon him extreme suffering of mind\nby their wrong course. He was not as pitiful and compassionate as\nour heavenly Father has been toward His erring, sinning, repenting\nchildren. When those who have caused him the greatest suffering\nacknowledged their wrongs heartily and fully, he could and did for-\ngive them, and fellowship them as brethren. But although the wrong\nwas healed in the sight of God, yet he sometimes in his own mind\nprobed that wound, and by referring to the past he suffered it to\nfester and make him unhappy. The fact that he had in his past course[614]\nsuffered so much which in his opinion might have been avoided, led\nhim to indulge a murmuring spirit against his brethren and against\nthe Lord. In this way he lived over the past and revived trials which\nshould have passed into oblivion instead of embittering his life with\nunprofitable remembrances. He has not always realized the pity\nand love that should be exercised toward those who have been so\nunfortunate as to fall under the temptations of Satan. They were\nthe real sufferers, the losers, not he, as long as he was steadfast,\npossessing the spirit of Christ. When these souls began to see their\nerrors, they had a hard battle to work their way to the light by humble\nconfessions. They had Satan to contend with, and their own proud\nspirit to overcome, and they needed help from those who were in the\nlight to bring them from their blind, discouraging condition, where\nthey could begin to hope and obtain strength to bruise Satan under\ntheir feet.\nI saw that my husband had been too exacting toward those who\nwere wrong and had injured him. He indulged dissatisfied feelings,\nwhich could be of no benefit to the erring and could but make his\nown heart very unhappy, unfitting it for the peace of God to dwell\nthere, which would lead him in everything to give thanks. The Lord\nCutting and Slashing 579\npermitted his mind to be desponding in regard to his own errors\nand mistakes, and to nearly despair of forgiveness, not because his\nsins were of such magnitude, but that he might know by experience\nhow painful and agonizing it would be to be without the forgiveness\nof God, and that he might understand the scripture: \u201cIf ye forgive\nnot men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your tres-\npasses.\u201d I saw that if God should be as exacting as we are, and should\ndeal with us as we deal with one another, we might all be thrown\ninto a state of hopeless despair.\nI was shown that God had suffered this affliction to come upon\nus to teach us much that we could not otherwise have learned in [615]\nso short a time. It was His will that we should go to -----, for our\nexperience could not have been thorough without it. He would have\nus see, and more fully understand, that it is impossible for those who\nobey the truth and are keeping His commandments, to live up to\ntheir convictions of duty and unite with the leaders at -----; so far as\nserving God is concerned, their principles can unite no better than\noil and water. It is only those of the purest principles and the greatest\nindependence of mind, who think and act for themselves, having the\nfear of God before them and trusting in Him, who can safely remain\nany length of time in -----. Those who are not thus qualified should\nnot be advised to go to that institution, for their minds will become\nbewildered by the smooth words of its conductors and poisoned by\ntheir sophistry, which originates with Satan.\nTheir influence and teachings in regard to the service of God\nand a religious life are in direct opposition to the teachings of our\nSaviour and His disciples. By precept and example they lower the\nstandard of piety and say that they need not sorrow for their sins or\nseparate from the world in order to be followers of Christ, but can\nmingle with the world and participate in its pleasures. These leaders\nwould not encourage their adherents to imitate the life of Christ\nin prayerfulness, sobriety, and dependence upon God. Persons of\nconscientious minds and firm trust in God cannot receive one half\nas much benefit at ----- as those can who have confidence in the\nreligious principles of the leaders of that institution. The former have\nto stand braced against much of their teachings, so far as religious\nprinciples are concerned, sifting everything they hear lest they should\nbe deceived and Satan obtain advantage over them.\n580 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nI saw that, as far as disease and its treatment is concerned,----- is\nthe best health institution in the United States. Yet the leaders there\nare but men, and their judgment is not always correct. The leading[616]\nphysician there would have his patients believe that his judgment is\nperfect, even as the judgment of God. Yet he often fails. He exalts\nhimself as God and fails to exalt the Lord as the only dependence.\nThose who have no trust or confidence in God, and who can see no\nbeauty in holiness or in the cross-bearing life of the Christian, can\nreceive more benefit at ----- than at any other health institution in the\nUnited States. The great secret of the success at this place is in the\ncontrol which the managers have over the minds of their patients.\nI saw that my husband and myself could not receive as much\nbenefit there as could those of different experience and faith. Said\nthe angel: \u201cGod has not designed that the mind of His servant, whom\nHe has chosen for a special purpose, to do a special work, should\nbe controlled by any living man, for that is His prerogative alone.\u201d\nAngels of God kept us while we were at -----. They were round\nabout us, sustaining us every hour. But the time came when we\ncould not benefit nor be benefited, and then the cloud of light, which\nhad rested with us there, moved away, and we could find rest only in\nleaving there and going among the brethren in Rochester, where the\ncloud of light rested.\nI saw that God would have us go to ----- for several reasons. Our\nposition while there, the earnest prayers we offered, our manifest\ntrust in God, the cheerfulness, courage, hope, and faith with which\nHe inspired us amidst our afflictions, had an influence and were\na testimony to all that the Christian has a source of strength and\nhappiness to which the lovers of pleasure are strangers. God gave us\na place in the hearts of all of influence at -----, and in the future as\nthe patients now there shall be scattered to their different homes, our\nlabors will bring us again to their notice, and when we are assailed,\nsome at least will be our defenders. Again, in going to -----, the\nLord would have us benefited by an experience which we would not\nobtain while at Battle Creek, surrounded by sympathizing brethren[617]\nand sisters. We must be separated from them, lest we lean upon\nthem instead of leaning upon the Lord and trusting in Him alone.\nSeparated almost entirely from God\u2019s people, we were shaken from\nevery earthly help and led to look to God alone. In so doing we\nCutting and Slashing 581\nobtained an experience which we could not have had if we had not\ngone to -----.\nWhen my husband\u2019s courage and hope began to waver, we could\nnot benefit anyone at that place and could not be benefited by a\nfurther experience there. It was the will of God that my husband\nshould not remain there shorn of his strength, but that in his state of\nweakness he should go among his brethren who could help him bear\nhis afflictions. While separated from God\u2019s people in our affliction,\nwe had an opportunity to reflect, to carefully review our past life,\nand see our mistakes and wrongs, and to humble ourselves before\nGod and seek His face by confession, humility, and frequent, earnest\nprayer. While engaged in active labor, bearing the burdens of others,\nand pressed with many cares, it was impossible for us to find time\nto reflect and carefully review the past, and learn the lessons which\nGod saw that it was necessary for us to learn. I was then shown\nthat God could not glorify His name by answering the supplications\nof His people and raising my husband to health in answer to their\nprayers, while we were at -----. It would be like uniting His power\nwith the power of darkness. Had He been pleased to manifest His\npower in restoring my husband, the physicians there would have\ntaken the glory which should be given to God.\nSaid the angel: \u201cGod will be glorified in the restoration of His\nservant to health. God has heard the prayers of His servants. His\narms are beneath His afflicted servant. God has the case, and he\nmust, although afflicted, dismiss his fears, his anxiety, his doubts\nand unbelief, and calmly trust in the great yet merciful God, who\npities, loves, and cares for him. He will have conflicts with the [618]\nenemy, but should ever be comforted with the remembrance that a\nstronger than the enemy has charge of him, and he need not fear. By\nfaith rely on the evidences which God has been pleased to give, and\nhe will gloriously triumph in God.\u201d\nI saw that the Lord was giving us an experience which would\nbe of the highest value to us in the future in connection with His\nwork. We are living in a solemn time amid the closing scenes of\nthis earth\u2019s history, and God\u2019s people are not awake. They must\narouse and make greater progress in reforming their habits of living,\nin eating, in dressing, in laboring and resting. In all these they\nshould glorify God and be prepared to give battle to our great foe\n582 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand to enjoy the precious victories which God has in reserve for\nthose who are exercising temperance in all things while striving for\nan incorruptible crown.\nI saw that God was fitting up my husband to engage in the\nsolemn, sacred work of reform which He designs shall progress\namong His people. It is important that instructions should be given\nby ministers in regard to living temperately. They should show\nthe relation which eating, working, resting, and dressing sustain to\nhealth. All who believe the truth for these last days have something\nto do in this matter. It concerns them, and God requires them to\narouse and interest themselves in this reform. He will not be pleased\nwith their course if they regard this question with indifference.\nThe abuses of the stomach by the gratification of appetite are\nthe fruitful source of most church trials. Those who eat and work\nintemperately and irrationally, talk and act irrationally. An intem-\nperate man cannot be a patient man. It is not necessary to drink\nalcoholic liquors in order to be intemperate. The sin of intemperate\neating, eating too frequently, too much, and of rich, unwholesome\nfood, destroys the healthy action of the digestive organs, affects the\nbrain, and perverts the judgment, preventing rational, calm, healthy\nthinking and acting. And this is a fruitful source of church trials.[619]\nTherefore in order for the people of God to be in an acceptable state\nwith Him, where they can glorify Him in their bodies and spirits\nwhich are His, they must with interest and zeal deny the gratification\nof their appetites, and exercise temperance in all things. Then may\nthey comprehend the truth in its beauty and clearness, and carry it\nout in their lives, and by a judicious, wise, straightforward course\ngive the enemies of our faith no occasion to reproach the cause of\ntruth. God requires all who believe the truth to make special, perse-\nvering efforts to place themselves in the best possible condition of\nbodily health, for a solemn and important work is before us. Health\nof body and mind is required for this work; it is as essential to a\nhealthy religious experience, to advancement in the Christian life\nand progress in holiness, as is the hand or foot to the human body.\nGod requires His people to cleanse themselves from all filthiness\nof the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of the Lord.\nAll those who are indifferent and excuse themselves from this work,\nwaiting for the Lord to do for them that which He requires them\nCutting and Slashing 583\nto do for themselves, will be found wanting when the meek of the\nearth, who have wrought His judgments, are hid in the day of the\nLord\u2019s anger.\nI was shown that if God\u2019s people make no efforts on their part,\nbut wait for the refreshing to come upon them and remove their\nwrongs and correct their errors; if they depend upon that to cleanse\nthem from filthiness of the flesh and spirit, and fit them to engage\nin the loud cry of the third angel, they will be found wanting. The\nrefreshing or power of God comes only on those who have pre-\npared themselves for it by doing the work which God bids them,\nnamely, cleansing themselves from all filthiness of the flesh and\nspirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\nI was shown that in some respects my husband\u2019s case is similar\nto that of those waiting for the refreshing. If he should wait for [620]\nthe power of God to come upon his body, to feel that he was made\nwhole before he made efforts in accordance with his faith, saying,\nWhen the Lord heals me I will believe and do this or that, he might\ncontinue to wait and would realize no change, for the fulfillment\nof God\u2019s promise is only realized by those who believe and then\nwork in accordance with their faith. I saw that he must believe God\u2019s\nword, that His promises are for him to claim, and they will never, no,\nnever, fail. He should walk out by faith, relying upon the evidences\nthat God has been pleased to give, and work, as much as possible, to\nthe point of becoming a well man. Said the angel: \u201cGod will sustain\nhim. His faith must be made perfect by works, for faith alone is dead.\nIt must be sustained by works. A living faith is always manifested\nby works.\u201d\nI saw that my husband would be inclined to shrink from making\nefforts in accordance with his faith. Fear and anxiety in regard to\nhis own case have made him timid. He looks at appearances, at\ndisagreeable feelings of the body. Said the angel: \u201cFeeling is not\nfaith. Faith is simply to take God at His word.\u201d I saw that in the\nname and strength of God my husband must resist disease and, by\nthe power of his will, rise above his poor feelings. He must assert\nhis liberty, in the name and strength of Israel\u2019s God. He must cease\nthinking and talking about himself as much as possible. He should\nbe cheerful and happy.\n584 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\n* * * * *\nI did see, December 25, 1865, as I have many times before seen,\nthat Elder F had often erred and had done much harm by a rash,\nunfeeling course toward those whom he supposed to be in fault.\nI had often seen that his work was in new fields, and that when\nhe should bring out a company upon the present truth he should\nleave the work of disciplining them to others, as his style of dealing,\narising from his rash spirit, his lack of patience and of judgment,\ndisqualified him for this work. I will here give the testimony which[621]\nI had for Brother F, written December 26, 1865, to show what I did\nsee in his case and because of the general application of much of the\ntestimony and also because he has made no response whatever, only\nin stating to others that the Lord in that view reproved my husband\nfor cutting and slashing. I would here state that another object in\ngiving the following testimony is that our brethren may more fully\nunderstand that Brother F\u2019s work is in new fields, and that they may\nnot place temptations in his way to leave his work, by urging him to\nlabor here and there among the churches, or to settle here or there.\n* * * * *\nChapter 107\u2014Danger of Self-Confidence\nBrother F ,\nDecember 25, 1865, I was shown that a good work had com-\nmenced in Maine. Especially was the field of labor shown me where\na company have been raised up as fruits of the labors of Brother\nAndrews and yourself, where they have manifested their interest\nand love for the truth by erecting a house of worship. There is yet\na great work to be done for this company. Quite a number have\nbeen converted to the theory of the truth; some have decided from\nthe weight of evidence; they see a beauty in the connected chain\nof truth, all uniting in a harmonious, perfect whole; they love the\nprinciples of the truth, yet they have not realized its sanctifying in-\nfluence. These souls are exposed to the perils of the last days. Satan\nhas prepared his deceptions and snares for the inexperienced. He is\nworking through his agents, even ministers who despise the truth\nand trample upon the law of God themselves and teach all who will\nlisten to them to do the same.\nThis company who have received unpopular truth can be safe\nonly as they make God their trust and are sanctified by the truth\nwhich they profess. They have taken an important step and now need\na religious experience which will make them sons and daughters of [622]\nthe most high God and heirs to the immortal inheritance purchased\nfor them by His dear Son. Those who have been instrumental in\npresenting the truth to them should not withdraw their labors at\nthis important period, but should still persevere in their efforts until\nthese souls are gathered into the fold of Christ. Sufficient instruction\nshould be given for them to understandingly obtain for themselves\nthe evidence that the truth is to them salvation.\nI saw that God would do a still greater work in Maine if all who\nlabor in the cause there are consecrated to Him and trust not to their\nown strength, but to the Strength of Israel. I was shown that Brother\nAndrews and yourself have labored hard and have not had the rest\nwhich you should have given yourselves in order to preserve health.\n585\n586 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nYou should labor with care and observe periods of rest. By so doing\nyou will retain your physical and mental vigor, and render your labor\nmuch more efficient. Brother F, you are a nervous man and move\nmuch from impulse. Mental depression influences your labor very\nmuch. At times you feel a want of freedom and think it is because\nothers are in darkness or wrong, or that something is the matter,\nyou can hardly tell what, and you make a drive somewhere and\nupon somebody, which is liable to do great harm. If you would quiet\nyourself when in this restless, nervous condition, and rest and calmly\nwait on God and inquire if the trouble is not in yourself, you would\nsave wounding your own soul and wounding the precious cause of\nGod.\nI saw that Brother F was in danger of becoming lifted up if\nhe was enabled in his discourses to strongly move the feelings of\nthe congregation. He would often think himself the most effectual\npreacher on that account. Here he sometimes deceives himself.\nAlthough he may be for the time the most acceptable preacher,\nyet he may fail to accomplish the most good. The preacher who\ncan affect the feelings to the greatest degree does not thereby give[623]\nevidence that he is the most useful.\nWhen Brother F is humble and makes God his trust, he can\ndo much good. Angels come to his help, and he is blessed with\nclearness and freedom. But after a time of special victory he has too\noften been lifted up and thought himself equal to anything, thought\nthat he was something, when he was only an instrument in the hands\nof God. After such seasons angels of God have left him to his own\nweak strength, and then, though he himself was the one at fault, he\nwould too frequently charge upon his brethren and the people the\ndarkness and weakness he felt. While in this unhappy state of mind\nhe frequently bears down upon this one and that one, and, even when\nhis work is not half done, feels that he must remove and commence\nlabor elsewhere.\nI saw that Brother F was in danger of going into battle in his\nown strength, but he will find that strength but weakness in the\nconflict. While he made God his trust, he has often been successful\nin combats with opposers of our faith. But he has sometimes felt\nelated with the victory which God has given truth over error, and has\nDanger of Self-Confidence 587\ntaken the glory to himself in these conflicts. Self has been magnified\nin his eyes.\nI was shown that in his last two discussions he did not have the\nright spirit. Previous to the first he became exalted by the flattery of\nmen who love not the truth. As he listened to, and acted some part\nin, a discussion carried on between two who were not in the faith,\nhe became lifted up and thought himself sufficient to enter the battle\nwith anyone. And while he was so confident, he was, in the very\nact, shorn of his strength. God was displeased with his disregard of\nthe counsel of Brother Andrews. His self-sufficient spirit came near\nmaking that discussion an utter failure. Unless there is a decided\ngain in these combats, there is always a loss. They should never be [624]\nrushed into heedlessly, but every move should be made cautiously,\nwith the greatest wisdom, for far more is pending than in a national\nbattle. Satan and his host are all astir at these conflicts between truth\nand error, and if the advocates of truth do not go into battle in the\nstrength of God, Satan will manage to outgeneral them every time.\nIn the second combat there was much, very much at stake. Yet\nhere again Brother F failed. He did not engage in that conflict\nfeeling his weakness and in humility and simplicity relying upon\nthe strength of God. He again felt a sufficiency in himself. His past\nsuccesses had lifted him up. He thought that the victories he had\ngained were very much due to his aptness in using the powerful\narguments furnished in the word of God.\nI was shown that the advocates of truth should not seek discus-\nsions. And whenever it is necessary for the advancement of the\ncause of truth and the glory of God that an opponent be met, how\ncarefully and with what humility should they go into the conflict.\nWith heart-searching, confession of sin, and earnest prayer, and often\nfasting for a time, they should entreat that God would especially help\nthem and give His saving, precious truth a glorious victory, that error\nmight appear in its true deformity and its advocates be completely\ndiscomfited. Those who battle for the truth, against its opposers,\nshould realize that they are not meeting merely men, but that they\nare contending with Satan and his angels, who are determined that\nerror and darkness shall retain the field and the truth be covered up\nwith error. As error is most in accordance with the natural heart, it\nis taken for granted to be clear. Men who are at ease love error and\n588 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndarkness, and are unwilling to be reformed by the truth. They do not\nlove to come to the light, lest their deeds should be reproved.\nIf those who stand in vindication of the truth, trust to the weight\nof argument, with but a feeble reliance upon God, and thus meet their\nopponents, nothing will be gained on the side of truth, but there will[625]\nbe a decided loss. Unless there is an evident victory in favor of truth,\nthe matter is left worse than before the conflict. Those who might\nformerly have had convictions in regard to the truth set their minds\nat rest and decide in favor of error, because in their darkened state\nthey cannot perceive that the truth had the advantage. These last two\ndiscussions did but little to advance the cause of God, and it would\nhave been better had they not occurred. Brother F did not engage in\nthem with a spirit of self-abasement and a firm reliance upon God.\nHe was puffed up by the enemy and had a spirit of self-sufficiency\nand confidence not becoming a humble servant of Christ. He had on\nhis own armor, not the armor of God.\nBrother F, God had provided you with a laborer of deep experi-\nence, the ablest in the field. He was one who had been acquainted\nin his own experience with the wiles of Satan, and who had passed\nthrough most intense mental anguish. He had been permitted in the\nall-wise providence of God to feel the heat of the refining furnace\nand had there learned that every refuge but God would fail and ev-\nery prop upon which he could lean for support would prove but a\nbroken reed. You should have realized that Brother Andrews had\nas deep an interest in the discussion as yourself, and you should\nhave listened in the spirit of humility to his counsel and profited by\nhis instructions. But Satan had an object to gain here, to defeat the\npurpose of God, and he stepped in to take possession of your mind\nand thereby thwart the work of God. You rushed into battle in your\nown strength, and angels left you to carry it on. But God in mercy\nto His cause would not suffer the enemies of His truth to obtain a\ndecided victory, and in answer to the earnest, agonizing prayers of\nHis servant, angels came to the rescue. Instead of an utter failure\nthere was a partial victory, that the enemies of truth might not exult\nover the believers. But nothing was gained by that effort, when there\nmight have been a glorious triumph of truth over error. There were[626]\ntwo of the ablest advocates of truth by your side; three men, with\nthe strength of truth, to stand against one man who was seeking to\nDanger of Self-Confidence 589\ncover up truth with error. In God you could have been a host, had\nyou entered the conflict right. Your self-sufficiency caused it to be\nalmost an entire failure.\nNever should you enter a discussion where so much is at stake,\nrelying upon your aptness to handle strong arguments. If it cannot\nbe well avoided, enter the conflict, but enter upon it with firm trust\nin God and in the spirit of humility, in the spirit of Jesus, who has\nbidden you learn of Him, who is meek and lowly in heart. And\nthen in order to glorify God and exemplify the character of Christ,\nyou should never take unlawful advantage of your opponent. Lay\naside sarcasm and playing upon words. Remember that you are in\na combat with Satan and his angels, as well as with the man. He\nwho overcame Satan in heaven and vanquished the fallen foe and\nexpelled him from heaven, and who died to redeem fallen man from\nhis power, when at the grave of Moses, disputing about his body,\ndurst not bring against Satan a railing accusation, but said: \u201cThe\nLord rebuke thee.\u201d\nIn your last two discussions you despised counsel and would not\nlisten to God\u2019s servant, whose whole soul was devoted to the work.\nGod in His providence provided you an adviser whose talents and\ninfluence entitled him to your respect and confidence, and it could\nin no way have injured your dignity to be guided by his experienced\njudgment. God\u2019s angels marked your self-sufficiency and with grief\nturned from you. He could not safely display His power in your\nbehalf, for you would have taken the glory to yourself, and your\nfuture labors would have been of but little value. I saw, Brother F,\nthat you should not, in your labors, lean upon your own judgment,\nwhich has so often led you astray. You should yield to the judgment\nof those of experience. Do not stand upon your own dignity and [627]\nfeel so self-sufficient that you cannot take the advice and counsel of\nexperienced fellow laborers.\nYour wife has been no special help to you, but rather a hindrance.\nHad she received and heeded the testimonies given her more than\ntwo years ago she would now be a strong helper with you in the\ngospel. But she has not received and really acted upon that testimony.\nHad she done this, her course would have been entirely different.\nShe has not been consecrated to God. She loves her ease, shuns\nburdens, and does not deny herself. She indulges in indolence, and\n590 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nher example is not worthy of imitation, but is an injury to the cause\nof God. At times she exerts a strong influence over you, especially\nif she feels homesick or discontented. Again, in church affairs she\nhas an influence over you. She forms her opinion of this brother or\nthat sister, and expresses dislike or strong attachment, while it has\nfrequently been the case that the very ones she takes into her heart\nhave been a source of great trial to the church. Her unconsecrated\nstate leads her to feel very strong attachments to those who manifest\ngreat confidence and love for her, while precious souls whom God\nloves may be passed coldly by because no fervent expressions of\nattachment are heard from them toward herself and Brother F. And\nyet the love of these very souls is true and is to be more highly prized\nthan that of those who make such protestations of their regard. The\nopinion your wife forms has a great influence on your mind. You\noften take it for granted that she is correct and think as she thinks\nand act in church matters accordingly.\nYou must exemplify the life of Christ, for solemn responsibilities\nrest upon you. Your wife is responsible to God for her course.\nIf she is a hindrance to you she must render an account to God.\nSometimes she arouses and humbles herself before God and is a real\nhelp; but she soon falls back into the same inactive state, shunning\nresponsibilities, and excusing herself from mental and physical labor.[628]\nHer health would be far better if she were more active, if she would\nengage more cheerfully and heartily in physical and mental labor.\nShe does not lack the ability, but the disposition to act; she will not\npersevere in cultivating a love for activity. God can do nothing for\nher in her present condition. She has something to do to arouse\nherself and devote to God her physical and mental energies. God\nrequires this of her, and in the day of God she will be found an\nunprofitable servant unless there is a thorough reformation on her\npart and she lives up to the light given. Until this reformation takes\nplace, she should not be at all united with her husband in his labors.\nGod will bless and sustain Brother F if he moves forward in\nhumility, leaning upon the judgment of experienced fellow laborers.\n* * * * *\nChapter 108\u2014Be Not Deceived\nIt is the work of Satan to deceive God\u2019s people and lead them\nfrom the right course. He will leave no means untried; he will come\nupon them where they are least guarded; hence the importance of\nfortifying every point. The Battle Creek church did not mean to turn\nagainst us, they are as good a church as lives; but there is much at\nstake at Battle Creek, and Satan will bring all his artillery against\nthem if by so doing he can hinder the work. We deeply sympathize\nwith this church in their present humbled condition and would say:\nLet not a spirit of triumph arise in any heart. God will heal all the\nwrongs of this dear people and yet make them a mighty defense\nof His truth if they walk humbly and watch and guard every point\nagainst the attacks of Satan. This people are kept continually under\nthe fire of the enemy. No other church would probably stand it as\nwell, therefore look with a pitying eye toward your brethren at Battle [629]\nCreek and pray God to help them in keeping the fort.\nWhen my husband was inactive, and I was kept at home on his\naccount, Satan was pleased, and no one was pressed by him to cast\nupon us such trials as are mentioned in the foregoing pages. But\nwhen we started out, December 19, 1866, he saw that there was a\nprospect of our doing something in the cause of Christ to the injury\nof his cause and that some of his deceptions upon the flock of God\nwould be exposed. He therefore felt called upon to do something\nto hinder us. And in no way could he so effectually do this as to\nlead our old friends at Battle Creek to withdraw their sympathy\nand cast burdens upon us. He took advantage of every unfavorable\ncircumstance and drove matters as by steam power.\nBut, thank God, he did not stop us nor fully crush us. Thank God\nthat we still live and that He has returned graciously to bless His\nerring, but now repenting, confessing people. Brethren, let us love\nthem the more and pray for them the more now that God manifests\nHis great love to them.\n591\n592 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nNumber Fourteen\u2014Testimony for the [630]\nChurch\nChapter 109\u2014Publishing Personal Testimonies\nIn Testimony No. 13 I gave a brief sketch of our labors and trials\nfrom December 19, 1866, to October 21, 1867. In these pages I will\nnotice the less painful experience of the past five months.\nDuring this time I have written many personal testimonies. And\nfor many persons whom I have met in our field of labor during the\npast five months I have testimonies still to write as I find time and\nhave strength, but just what my duty is in relation to these personal\ntestimonies has long been a matter of no small anxiety to me. With\na few exceptions I have sent them to the ones to whom they related\nand have left these persons to dispose of them as they chose. The\nresults have been various:\n1. Some have thankfully received the testimonies and have\nresponded to them in a good spirit and have profited by them. These\nhave been willing that their brethren should see the testimonies and\nhave freely and fully confessed their faults.\n2. Others have acknowledged that the testimonies to them were\ntrue, but after reading them have laid them away to remain in silence,\nwhile they have made but little change in their lives. These testi-\nmonies related more or less to the churches to which these persons\nbelonged, who could also have been benefited by them. But all this[631]\nwas lost in consequence of these testimonies\u2019 being held private.\n3. Still others have rebelled against the testimonies. Some of\nthese have responded in a faultfinding spirit. Some have shown\nbitterness, anger, and wrath, and in return for my toil and pains\nin writing the testimonies they have turned upon us to injure us\nall they could; while others have held me for hours in personal\ninterviews to pour into my ears and my aching heart their complaints,\nmurmurings, and self-justifications, perhaps appealing to their own\nsympathies with weeping, and losing sight of their own faults and\nsins. The influence of these things has been terrible upon me and has\nsometimes driven me nearly to distraction. That which has followed\nfrom the conduct of these unconsecrated, unthankful persons has\n594\nPublishing Personal Testimonies 595\ncost me more suffering and has worn upon my courage and health\nten times more than all the toil of writing the testimonies.\nAnd all this has been suffered by me, and my brethren and sisters\ngenerally have known nothing about it. They have had no just idea\nof the amount of wearing labor of this kind which I have had to\nperform, nor of the burdens and sufferings unjustly thrown upon\nme. I have given some personal communications in several numbers\nof my testimonies, and in some cases persons have been offended\nbecause I did not publish all such communications. On account of\ntheir number this would be hardly possible, and it would be improper\nfrom the fact that some of them relate to sins which need not, and\nshould not, be made public.\nBut I have finally decided that many of these personal testimonies\nshould be published, as they all contain more or less reproof and\ninstruction which apply to hundreds or thousands of others in similar\ncondition. These should have the light which God has seen fit to\ngive which meets their cases. It is a wrong to shut it away from them\nby sending it to one person or to one place, where it is kept as a [632]\nlight under a bushel. My convictions of duty on this point have been\ngreatly strengthened by the following dream:\nA grove of evergreens was presented before me. Several, in-\ncluding myself, were laboring among them. I was bidden to closely\ninspect the trees and see if they were in a flourishing condition. I\nobserved that some were being bent and deformed by the wind, and\nneeded to be supported by stakes. I was carefully removing the\ndirt from the feeble and dying trees to ascertain the cause of their\ncondition. I discovered worms at the roots of some. Others had not\nbeen watered properly and were dying from drought. The roots of\nothers had been crowded together to their injury. My work was to\nexplain to the workmen the different reasons why these trees did not\nprosper. This was necessary from the fact that trees in other grounds\nwere liable to be affected as these had been, and the cause of their\nnot flourishing and how they should be cultivated and treated must\nbe made known.\nIn this testimony I speak freely of the case of Sister Hannah\nMore, not from a willingness to grieve the Battle Creek church, but\nfrom a sense of duty. I love that church notwithstanding their faults.\nI know of no church that in acts of benevolence and general duty do\n596 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nso well. I present the frightful facts in this case to arouse our people\neverywhere to a sense of their duty. Not one in twenty of those\nwho have a good standing with Seventh-day Adventists is living\nout the self-sacrificing principles of the word of God. But let not\ntheir enemies, who are destitute of the first principles of the doctrine\nof Christ, take advantage of the fact that they are reproved. This\nis evidence that they are the children of the Lord. Those who are\nwithout chastisement, says the apostle, are bastards and not sons.\nThen let not these illegitimate children boast over the lawful sons\nand daughters of the Almighty.\nChapter 110\u2014The Health Institute [633]\nIn former numbers of Testimonies for the ChurchI have spoken\nof the importance of Seventh-day Adventists\u2019 establishing an insti-\ntution for the benefit of the sick, especially for the suffering and sick\namong us. I have spoken of the ability of our people, in point of\nmeans, to do this; and have urged that, in view of the importance of\nthis branch of the great work of preparation to meet the Lord with\ngladness of heart, our people should feel themselves called upon,\naccording to their ability, to put a portion of their means into such an\ninstitution. I have also pointed out, as they were shown to me, some\nof the dangers to which physicians, managers, and others would be\nexposed in the prosecution of such an enterprise; and I did hope that\nthe dangers shown me would be avoided. In this, however, I enjoyed\nhope for a time, only to suffer disappointment and grief.\nI had taken great interest in the health reform and had high hopes\nof the prosperity of the Health Institute. I felt, as no other one could\nfeel, the responsibility of speaking to my brethren and sisters in\nthe name of the Lord concerning this institution and their duty to\nfurnish necessary means, and I watched the progress of the work\nwith intense interest and anxiety. When I saw those who managed\nand directed, running into the dangers shown me, of which I had\nwarned them in public and also in private conversation and letters,\na terrible burden came upon me. That which had been shown me\nas a place where the suffering sick among us could be helped was\none where sacrifice, hospitality, faith, and piety should be the ruling\nprinciples. But when unqualified calls were made for large sums of\nmoney, with the statement that stock taken would pay large per cent;\nwhen the brethren who occupied positions in the institution seemed [634]\nmore than willing to take larger wages than those were satisfied with\nwho filled other and equally important stations in the great cause of\ntruth and reform; when I learned, with pain, that, in order to make\nthe institution popular with those not of our faith and to secure their\npatronage, a spirit of compromise was rapidly gaining ground at the\n597\n598 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nInstitute, manifested in the use of Mr., Miss, and Mrs., instead of\nBrother and Sister, and in popular amusements, in which all could\nengage in a sort of comparatively innocent frolic\u2014when I saw these\nthings, I said: This is not that which was shown me as an institution\nfor the sick which would share the signal blessing of God. This is\nanother thing.\nAnd yet calculations for more extensive buildings were made,\nand calls for large sums of money were urged. As it was then\nmanaged, I could but regard the Institute, on the whole, as a curse.\nAlthough some were benefited healthwise, the influence on the\nchurch at Battle Creek and upon brethren and sisters who visited the\nInstitute was so bad as to overbalance all the good that was done; and\nthis influence was reaching churches in this and other states, and was\nterribly destructive to faith in God and in the present truth. Several\nwho came to Battle Creek humble, devoted, confiding Christians,\nwent away almost infidels. The general influence of these things\nwas creating prejudice against the health reform in very many of the\nmost humble, the most devoted, and the best of our brethren, and\nwas destroying faith in my Testimonies and in the present truth.\nIt was this state of matters relative to the health reform and the\nHealth Institute, with which other things were brought to bear, that\nmade it my duty to speak as I did in Testimony No. 13. I well knew\nthat that would produce a reaction and trial in many minds. I also\nknew that a reaction must come sooner or later, and, for the good\nof the Institute and the cause generally, the sooner the better. Had[635]\nmatters been moving in a wrong direction, to the injury of precious\nsouls and the cause generally, the sooner this could be checked,\nand they be properly directed the better. The further the advance,\nthe greater the ruin, the greater the reaction, and the greater the\ngeneral discouragement. The misdirected work must have such a\ncheck; there must be time to correct errors and start again in the\nright direction.\nThe good work wrought for the church at Battle Creek last fall,\nthe thorough reform and turning to the Lord by physicians, helpers,\nand managers at the Health Institute, and the general agreement of\nour brethren and sisters in all parts of the field relative to the great\nobject of the Health Institute and the manner it should be conducted,\nto which is added the varied experience of more than one year, not\nHealth Institute 599\nonly in the wrong course, but also in a right direction, give me more\nconfidence that the health reform and the Health Institute will prove\na success than I ever had before. I still fondly hope to see the Health\nInstitute at Battle Creek prospering and in every respect the institute\nshown me. But it will take time to fully correct and outgrow the\nerrors of the past. With the blessing of God this can and will be\ndone.\nThe brethren who have stood at the head of this work have\nappealed to our people for means, on the ground that the health\nreform is a part of the great work connected with the third angel\u2019s\nmessage. In this they have been right. It is a branch of the great,\ncharitable, liberal, sacrificing, benevolent work of God. Then why\nshould these brethren say: \u201cStock in the Health Institute will pay a\nlarge per cent,\u201d \u201cit is a good investment,\u201d \u201ca paying thing\u201d? Why\nnot as well talk of stock in the Publishing Association paying a large\nper cent? If these are two branches of the same great, closing work\nof preparation for the coming of the Son of man, why not? Or why\nnot make them both matters of liberality? The pen and the voice [636]\nthat appealed to the friends of the cause in behalf of the publishing\nfund held out no such inducements. Why, then, represent to wealthy,\ncovetous Sabbathkeepers that they may do great good by investing\ntheir means in the Health Institute, and at the same time retain the\nprincipal, and also receive large per cent for the simple use of it? The\nbrethren were called upon to donate for the Publishing Association,\nand they nobly and cheerfully sacrificed unto the Lord, following\nthe example of the one who made the call, and the blessing of God\nhas been upon that branch of the great work. But it is to be feared\nthat His displeasure is upon the manner in which funds have been\nraised for the Health Institute, and that His blessing will not be upon\nthat institution to the full, till this wrong shall be corrected. In my\nappeal to the brethren in behalf of such an institution, in Testimony\nNo. 11, page 492, I said:\n\u201cI was shown that there is no lack of means among Sabbathkeep-\ning Adventists. At present their greatest danger is in their accumula-\ntions of property. Some are continually increasing their cares and\nlabors; they are overcharged. The result is, God and the wants of His\ncause are nearly forgotten by them; they are spiritually dead. They\n600 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nare required to make a sacrifice to God, an offering. A sacrifice does\nnot increase, but decreases and consumes.\u201d\nMy view of this matter of means was that there should be \u201ca\nsacrifice to God, an offering;\u201d and I never received any other idea.\nBut if the principal is to be held good by stockholders, and they are\nto draw a certain per cent, where is the decrease, or the consuming\nsacrifice? And how are the dangers of those Sabbathkeepers who\nare accumulating property decreased by the present plan of holding\nstock in the Institute? Their dangers are only increased. And here\nis an additional excuse for their covetousness. In investing in stock\nin the Institute, held as a matter of sale and purchase like any other[637]\nproperty, they do not sacrifice. As a large per cent is held out as\nan inducement, the spirit of gain, not sacrifice, leads them to invest\nso largely in the stock of the Institute that they have but little if\nanything to give to sustain other and still more important branches of\nthe work. God requires of these close, covetous, worldly persons a\nsacrifice for suffering humanity. He calls on them to let their worldly\npossessions decrease for the sake of the afflicted ones who believe\nin Jesus and the present truth. They should have a chance to act in\nfull view of the decisions of the final judgment, as described in the\nfollowing burning words of the King of kings:\nMatthew 25:34-46: \u201cThen shall the King say unto them on His\nright hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom\nprepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an\nhungered, and ye gave Me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink:\nI was a stranger, and ye took Me in: naked, and ye clothed Me: I\nwas sick, and ye visited Me: I was in prison, and ye came unto Me.\nThen shall the righteous answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we\nThee an hungered, and fed Thee? or thirsty, and gave Thee drink?\nWhen saw we Thee a stranger, and took Thee in? or naked, and\nclothed Thee? Or when saw we Thee sick, or in prison, and came\nunto Thee? And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I\nsay unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of\nthese My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\n\u201cThen shall He say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from\nMe, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his\nangels: for I was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty,\nand ye gave Me no drink: I was a stranger, and ye took Me not in:\nHealth Institute 601\nnaked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited Me\nnot. Then shall they also answer Him, saying, Lord, when saw we\nThee anhungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in [638]\nprison, and did not minister unto Thee? Then shall He answer them,\nsaying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of\nthe least of these, ye did it not to Me. And these shall go away into\neverlasting punishment; but the righteous into life eternal.\u201d\nAgain on page 494 of Testimony No. 11, I said: \u201cThere is a lib-\neral supply of means among our people, and if all felt the importance\nof the work, this great enterprise could be carried forward without\nembarrassment. All should feel a special interest in sustaining it.\nEspecially should those who have means invest in this enterprise. A\nsuitable home should be fitted up for the reception of invalids that\nthey may, by the use of proper means and the blessing of God, be\nrelieved of their infirmities and learn how to take care of themselves\nand thus prevent sickness.\n\u201cMany who profess the truth are growing close and covetous.\nThey need to be alarmed for themselves. They have so much of their\ntreasure upon the earth that their hearts are on their treasure. Much\nthe larger share of their treasure is in this world, and but little in\nheaven; therefore their affections are placed on earthly possessions\ninstead of on the heavenly inheritance. There is now a good opportu-\nnity for them to use their means for the benefit of suffering humanity\nand also for the advancement of the truth. This enterprise should\nnever be left to struggle in poverty. These stewards to whom God\nhas entrusted means should now come up to the work and use their\nmeans to His glory. To those who through covetousness withhold\ntheir means, it will prove a curse rather than a blessing.\u201d\nIn what I have been shown and what I have said, I received no\nother idea, and designed to give no other, than that the raising of\nfunds for this branch of the work was to be a matter of liberality, the\nsame as for the support of other branches of the great work. And\nalthough the change from the present plan to one that can be fully [639]\napproved of the Lord may be attended with difficulties and require\ntime and labor, yet I think that it can be made with little loss of stock\nalready taken, and that it will result in a decided increase of capital\ndonated to be used in a proper manner to relieve suffering humanity.\n602 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nMany who have taken stock are not able to donate it. Some\nof these persons are suffering for the very money which they have\ninvested in stock. As I travel from state to state, I find afflicted\nones standing on the very verge of the grave, who should go to the\nInstitute for a while, but cannot for want of the means they have\nin Institute stock. These should not have a dollar invested there.\nOne case in Vermont I will mention. As early as 1850 this brother\nbecame a Sabbathkeeper, and from that date he contributed liberally\nto the several enterprises that have been undertaken to advance the\ncause, till he became reduced in property. Yet when the urgent,\nunqualified call came for the Institute, he took stock to the amount\nof one hundred dollars. At the meeting at ----- he introduced the\ncase of his wife, who is very feeble, and who can be helped, but\nmust be helped soon, if ever. He also stated his circumstances, and\nsaid that if he could command the one hundred dollars then in the\nInstitute, he could send his wife there to be treated; but as it was, he\ncould not. We replied that he should never have invested a dollar in\nthe Institute, that there was a wrong in the matter which we could\nnot help, and there the matter dropped. I do not hesitate to say that\nthis sister should be treated, a few weeks at least, at the Institute free\nof charge. Her husband is able to do but little more than to pay her\nfare to and from Battle Creek.\nThe friends of humanity, of truth and holiness, should act in\nreference to the Institute on the plan of sacrifice and liberality. I\nhave five hundred dollars in stock in the Institute, which I wish to\ndonate, and if my husband succeeds with his anticipated book, he\nwill give five hundred dollars more. Will those who approve this\nplan please address us at Greenville, Montcalm County, Michigan,[640]\nand state the sums they wish to donate, or to invest in stock to be held\nas the stock in the Publishing Association is held. When this is done,\nthen let the donations come in as needed; let the sums, small and\nlarge, come in. Let means be expended judiciously. Let charges for\npatients be as reasonable as possible. Let brethren donate to partly\npay the expenses at the Institute of the suffering, worthy poor among\nthem. Let the feeble ones be led out, as they can bear it, to cultivate\nthe beautifully situated acres owned by the Institute. Let them not\ndo this with the narrow idea of pay, but with the liberal idea that the\nexpense of the purchase of them was a matter of benevolence for\nHealth Institute 603\ntheir good. Let their labor be a part of their prescription, as much as\nthe taking of baths. Let benevolence, charity, humanity, sacrifice for\nothers\u2019 good, be the ruling idea with physicians, managers, helpers,\npatients, and with all the friends of Jesus, far and near, instead of\nwages, good investment, a paying thing, stock that will pay. Let\nthe love of Christ, love for souls, sympathy for suffering humanity,\ngovern all we say and do relative to the Health Institute.\nWhy should the Christian physician, who is believing, expecting,\nlooking, waiting, and longing for the coming and kingdom of Christ,\nwhen sickness and death will no longer have power over the saints,\nexpect more pay for his services than the Christian editor or the\nChristian minister? He may say that his work is more wearing. That\nis yet to be proved. Let him work as he can endure it, and not violate\nthe laws of life which he teaches to his patients. There are no good\nreasons why he should overwork and receive large pay for it, more\nthan the minister or the editor. Let all who act a part in the Institute\nand receive pay for their services, act on the same liberal principle.\nNo one should be suffered to remain as helper in the Institute who\ndoes it simply for pay. There are those of ability who, for the love of\nChrist, His cause, and the suffering followers of their Master, will [641]\nfill stations in that Institute faithfully and cheerfully, and with a spirit\nof sacrifice. Those who have not this spirit should remove and give\nplace to those who have it.\nAs nearly as I am able to judge, one half of the afflicted among\nour people who should spend weeks or months at the Institute are not\nable to pay the entire expense of the journey and a tarry there. Shall\npoverty keep these friends of our Lord from the blessings which\nHe has so bountifully provided? Shall they be left to struggle on\nwith the double burden of feebleness and poverty? The wealthy\nfeeble ones, who have all the comforts and conveniences of life,\nand are able to hire their hard work done, may, with care and rest,\nby informing themselves and taking home treatment, enjoy a very\ncomfortable state of health without going to the Institute. But what\ncan our poor, feeble brethren or sisters do to recover health? They\nmay do something, but poverty drives them to labor beyond what\nthey are really able. They have not even all the comforts of life;\nand as for conveniences in houseroom, furniture, means of taking\nbaths, and arrangements for good ventilation, they do not have them.\n604 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nPerhaps their only room is occupied by a cookstove, winter and\nsummer; and it may be that all the books they have in the house,\nexcepting the Bible, could be held between the thumb and finger.\nThey have no money to buy books that they may read and learn how\nto live. These dear brethren are the very ones who need help. Many\nof them are humble Christians. They may have faults, and some of\nthese may reach far back and be the cause of their present poverty\nand misery. And yet they may be living up to duty better than we\nwho have the means to improve our own condition and that of others.\nThese must be patiently taught and cheerfully helped.\nBut they must be willing and anxious to be taught. They must\ncherish a spirit of gratitude to God and their brethren for the help[642]\nthey receive. Such persons generally have no just ideas of the real\nexpense of treatment, board, room, fuel, etc., at a Health Institute.\nThey do not realize the magnitude of the great work of present truth\nand reform, and the many calls for the liberalities of our people.\nThey may not be aware that the numbers of our poor are many times\nlarger than the numbers of our rich. And they may not also feel the\nforce of the frightful fact that a majority of these wealthy ones are\nholding on to their riches and are in the sure road to perdition.\nThese poor afflicted persons should be taught that when they\nmurmur at their lot and against the wealthy on account of their cov-\netousness, they commit a great sin in the sight of heaven. They\nshould first understand that their sickness and poverty are misfor-\ntunes most generally caused by their own sins, follies, and wrongs;\nand if the Lord puts it into the hearts and minds of His people to\nhelp them, it should inspire in them feelings of humble gratitude\nto God and His people. They should do all in their power to help\nthemselves. If they have relatives who can and will defray their\nexpenses at the Institute, these should have the privilege.\nAnd in view of the many poor and afflicted ones who must, to\na greater or less extent, be objects of the charity of the Institute,\nand because of the lack of funds and the want of accommodations\nat the present time, the stay of such at the Institute must be brief.\nThey should go there with the idea of obtaining, as fast and as far as\npossible, a practical knowledge of what they must do, and what they\nmust not do, to recover health and to live healthfully. The lectures\nwhich they hear while at the Institute, and good books from which to\nHealth Institute 605\nlearn how to live at home, must be the main reliance of such. They\nmay find some relief during a few weeks spent at the Institute, but\nwill realize more at home in carrying out the same principles. They\nmust not rely on the physicians to cure them in a few weeks, but\nmust learn so to live as to give nature a chance to work the cure. [643]\nThis may commence during a few weeks\u2019 stay at the Institute, and\nyet it may require years to complete the work by correct habits at\nhome.\nA man may spend all that he has in this world at a Health Institute,\nand find great relief, and may then return to his family and to his old\nhabits of life, and in a few weeks or months be in a worse condition\nof health than ever before. He has gained nothing; he has spent his\nlimited means for nothing. The object of the health reform and the\nHealth Institute is not, like a dose of \u201cPainkiller\u201d or \u201cInstant Relief,\u201d\nto quiet the pains of today. No, indeed! Its great object is to teach\nthe people how to live so as to give nature a chance to remove and\nresist disease.\nTo the afflicted among our people I wish to say, Be not discour-\naged. God has not forsaken His people and His cause. Make known\nyour state of health and your ability to meet the expenses of a stay\nat the Institute to the physicians, addressing Health Institute, Battle\nCreek, Michigan. Are you diseased, running down, feeble, then do\nnot delay till your case is hopeless. Write immediately. But I must\nsay again to the poor: At present but little can be done to help you,\non account of capital already raised being invested in material and\nbuildings. Do all you possibly can for yourselves, and others will\nhelp you some.\n* * * * *\nChapter 111\u2014Sketch of Experience\nFrom October 21, 1867 to December 22, 1867\nOur labor with the Battle Creek church had just closed, and,\nnotwithstanding we were much worn, we had been so refreshed\nin spirit as we witnessed the good result that we cheerfully joined\nBrother J. N. Andrews in the long journey to Maine. On the way\nwe held a meeting at Roosevelt, New York.Testimony No. 13 was\ndoing its work, and those brethren who had taken part in the general[644]\ndisaffection were beginning to see things in their true light. This\nmeeting was one of hard labor, in which pointed testimonies were\ngiven. Confessions were made, followed by a general turning to the\nLord on the part of backsliders and sinners.\nOur labors in Maine commenced with the Conference at Nor-\nridgewock the first of November. The meeting was large. As usual,\nmy husband and myself bore a plain and pointed testimony in favor\nof truth and proper discipline, and against the different forms of\nerror, confusion, fanaticism, and disorder naturally growing out of a\nwant of such discipline. This testimony was especially applicable to\nthe condition of things in Maine. Disorderly spirits who professed\nto observe the Sabbath were in rebellion and labored to diffuse the\ndisaffection through the Conference. Satan helped them, and they\nsucceeded to some extent. The details are too painful and of too\nlittle general importance to be given here.\nIt may be enough to say at this time that in consequence of this\nspirit of rebellion, faultfinding, and, with some, a sort of babyish\njealousy, murmuring, and complaining, our work in Maine, which\nmight have been done in two weeks, required seven weeks of the\nmost trying, laborious, and disagreeable toil. Five weeks were lost,\nyes, worse than lost, to the cause in Maine; and our people in other\nportions of New England, New York, and Ohio were deprived of\nfive general meetings in consequence of our being held in Maine.\nBut as we left that state we were comforted with the fact that all had\nconfessed their rebellion, and that a few had been led to seek the\n606\nSketch of Experience 607\nLord and embrace the truth. The following, relative to ministers,\norder, and organization, has a special application to the condition of\nthings in Maine.\nChapter 112\u2014Ministers, Order, and Organization[645]\nSome ministers have fallen into the error that they cannot have\nliberty in speaking unless they raise their voices to a high pitch and\ntalk loud and fast. Such should understand that noise and loud, hur-\nried speaking are not evidence of the presence of the power of God.\nIt is not the power of the voice that makes the lasting impression.\nMinisters should be Bible students, and should thoroughly furnish\nthemselves with the reasons of our faith and hope, and then, with\nfull control of the voice and feelings, they should present these in\nsuch a manner that the people can calmly weigh them and decide\nupon the evidences given. And as ministers feel the force of the\narguments which they present in the form of solemn, testing truth,\nthey will have zeal and earnestness according to knowledge. The\nSpirit of God will sanctify to their own souls the truths which they\npresent to others, and they will be watered themselves while they\nwater others.\nI saw that some of our ministers do not understand how to pre-\nserve their strength so as to be able to perform the greatest amount\nof labor without exhaustion. Ministers should not pray so loud and\nlong as to exhaust their strength. It is not necessary to weary the\nthroat and lungs in prayer. God\u2019s ear is ever open to hear the heartfelt\npetitions of His humble servants, and He does not require them to\nwear out the organs of speech in addressing Him. It is the perfect\ntrust, the firm reliance, the steady claiming of the promises of God,\nthe simple faith that He is and that He is a rewarder of all those who\ndiligently seek Him, that prevails with God.\nMinisters should discipline themselves and learn how to perform\nthe greatest amount of labor in the brief period allotted them, and yet\npreserve a good degree of strength, so that if an extra effort should\nbe required, they may have a reserve of vital force sufficient for\nthe occasion, which they can employ without injuring themselves.[646]\nSometimes all the strength they have is needed to put forth effort at\na given point, and if they have previously exhausted their fund of\n608\nMinisters, Order, and Organization 609\nstrength and cannot command the power to make this effort, all they\nhave done is lost. At times all the mental and physical energies may\nbe drawn upon to make the very strongest stand, to array evidences\nin the clearest light, and set them before the people in the most\npointed manner, and urge them home by the strongest appeals. As\nsouls are on the point of leaving the enemy\u2019s ranks and coming up\non the Lord\u2019s side, the contest is most severe and close. Satan and\nhis angels are unwilling that any who have served under the banner\nof darkness should take their position under the bloodstained banner\nof Prince Immanuel.\nI was shown opposing armies who had endured a painful struggle\nin battle. The victory was gained by neither, and at length the loyal\nrealize that their strength and force is wearing away, and that they\nwill be unable to silence their enemies unless they make a charge\nupon them and obtain their instruments of warfare. It is then, at\nthe risk of their lives, that they summon all their powers and rush\nupon the foe. It is a fearful struggle; but victory is gained, the\nstrongholds are taken. If at the critical period the army is so weak\nthrough exhaustion that it is impossible to make the last charge and\nbatter down the enemy\u2019s fortifications, the whole struggle of days,\nweeks, and even months is lost; and many lives are sacrificed and\nnothing gained.\nA similar work is before us. Many are convinced that we have the\ntruth, and yet they are held as with iron bands; they dare not risk the\nconsequences of taking their position on the side of truth. Many are\nin the valley of decision, where special, close, and pointed appeals\nare necessary to move them to lay down the weapons of their warfare\nand take their position on the Lord\u2019s side. Just at this critical period\nSatan throws the strongest bands around these souls. If the servants\nof God are all exhausted, having expended their fund of physical [647]\nand mental strength, they think they can do no more, and frequently\nleave the field entirely, to commence operations elsewhere. And all,\nor nearly all, the time, means, and labor have been spent for nought.\nYes, it is worse than if they had never commenced the work in that\nplace, for after the people have been deeply convicted by the Spirit\nof God, and brought to the point of decision, and are left to lose their\ninterest, and decide against these evidences, they cannot as easily be\n610 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbrought where their minds will again be agitated upon the subject.\nThey have in many cases made their final decision.\nIf ministers would preserve a reserve force, and at the very point\nwhere everything seems to move the hardest, then make the most\nearnest efforts, the strongest appeals, the closest applications, and,\nlike valiant soldiers, at the critical moment make the charge upon\nthe enemy, they would gain the victory. Souls would have strength\nto break the bands of Satan and make their decisions for everlasting\nlife. Well-directed labor at the right time will make a long-tried\neffort successful, when to leave the labor even for a few days will in\nmany cases cause an entire failure. Ministers must give themselves\nas missionaries to the work and learn how to make their efforts to\nthe very best advantage.\nSome ministers at the very commencement of a series of meet-\nings become very zealous, take on burdens which God does not\nrequire them to bear, exhaust their strength in singing and in long,\nloud praying and talking, and then are worn out and must go home\nto rest. What was accomplished in that effort? Literally nothing.\nThe laborers had spirit and zeal, but lacked understanding. They\nmanifested no wise generalship. They rode upon the chariot of feel-\ning, but there was not one victory gained against the enemy. His\nstronghold was not taken.\nI was shown that ministers of Christ should discipline themselves\nfor the warfare. Greater wisdom is required in generalship in the[648]\nwork of God than is required of the generals engaged in national\nbattles. Ministers of God\u2019s choosing are engaged in a great work.\nThey are warring not merely against men, but against Satan and\nhis angels. Wise generalship is required here. They must become\nBible students and give themselves wholly to the work. When they\ncommence labor in a place, they should be able to give the reasons\nof our faith, not in a boisterous manner, not with a perfect storm, but\nwith meekness and fear. The power which will convince is strong\narguments presented in meekness and in the fear of God.\nAble ministers of Christ are required for the work in these last\ndays of peril, able in word and doctrine, acquainted with the Scrip-\ntures, and understanding the reasons of our faith. I was directed to\nthese scriptures, the meaning of which has not been realized by some\nministers: \u201cBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready\nMinisters, Order, and Organization 611\nalways to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of\nthe hope that is in you with meekness and fear.\u201d \u201cLet your speech\nbe alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye\nought to answer every man.\u201d \u201cAnd the servant of the Lord must not\nstrive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness\ninstructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will\ngive them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; and that\nthey may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are\ntaken captive by him at his will.\u201d\nThe man of God, the minister of Christ, is required to be thor-\noughly furnished unto all good works. A pompous minister, all\ndignity, is not needed for this good work. But decorum is necessary\nin the desk. A minister of the gospel should not be regardless of his\nattitude. If he is the representative of Christ, his deportment, his atti-\ntude, his gestures, should be of such a character as will not strike the\nbeholder with disgust. Ministers should possess refinement. They\nshould discard all uncouth manners, attitudes, and gestures, and\nshould encourage in themselves humble dignity of bearing. They [649]\nshould be clothed in a manner befitting the dignity of their position.\nTheir speech should be in every respect solemn and well chosen. I\nwas shown that it is wrong to make coarse, irreverent expressions,\nrelate anecdotes to amuse, or present comic illustrations to create a\nlaugh. Sarcasm and playing upon the words of an opponent are all\nout of God\u2019s order. Ministers should not feel that they can make no\nimprovement in voice or manners; much can be done. The voice can\nbe cultivated so that quite lengthy speaking will not injure the vocal\norgans.\nMinisters should love order and should discipline themselves,\nand then they can successfully discipline the church of God and\nteach them to work harmoniously like a well-drilled company of\nsoldiers. If discipline and order are necessary for successful action\non the battlefield, the same are as much more needful in the warfare\nin which we are engaged as the object to be gained is of greater\nvalue and more elevated in character than those for which opposing\nforces contend upon the field of battle. In the conflict in which we\nare engaged, eternal interests are at stake.\nAngels work harmoniously. Perfect order characterizes all their\nmovements. The more closely we imitate the harmony and order\n612 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof the angelic host, the more successful will be the efforts of these\nheavenly agents in our behalf. If we see no necessity for harmonious\naction, and are disorderly, undisciplined, and disorganized in our\ncourse of action, angels, who are thoroughly organized and move\nin perfect order, cannot work for us successfully. They turn away\nin grief, for they are not authorized to bless confusion, distraction,\nand disorganization. All who desire the co-operation of the heavenly\nmessengers must work in unison with them. Those who have the\nunction from on high will in all their efforts encourage order, disci-\npline, and union of action, and then the angels of God can co-operate\nwith them. But never, never will these heavenly messengers place[650]\ntheir endorsement upon irregularity, disorganization, and disorder.\nAll these evils are the result of Satan\u2019s efforts to weaken our forces,\nto destroy courage, and prevent successful action.\nSatan well knows that success can only attend order and harmo-\nnious action. He well knows that everything connected with heaven\nis in perfect order, that subjection and thorough discipline mark\nthe movements of the angelic host. It is his studied effort to lead\nprofessed Christians just as far from heaven\u2019s arrangement as he can;\ntherefore he deceives even the professed people of God and makes\nthem believe that order and discipline are enemies to spirituality,\nthat the only safety for them is to let each pursue his own course,\nand to remain especially distinct from bodies of Christians who are\nunited and are laboring to establish discipline and harmony of action.\nAll the efforts made to establish order are considered dangerous, a\nrestriction of rightful liberty, and hence are feared as popery. These\ndeceived souls consider it a virtue to boast of their freedom to think\nand act independently. They will not take any man\u2019s say-so. They\nare amenable to no man. I was shown that it is Satan\u2019s special work\nto lead men to feel that it is in God\u2019s order for them to strike out\nfor themselves and choose their own course, independent of their\nbrethren.\nI was pointed back to the children of Israel. Very soon after\nleaving Egypt they were organized and most thoroughly disciplined.\nGod had in His special providence qualified Moses to stand at the\nhead of the armies of Israel. He had been a mighty warrior to lead\nthe armies of the Egyptians, and in generalship he could not be\nsurpassed by any man. The Lord did not leave His holy tabernacle to\nMinisters, Order, and Organization 613\nbe borne indiscriminately by any tribe that might choose. He was so\nparticular as to specify the order He would have observed in bearing\nthe sacred ark and to designate a special family of the tribe of the\nLevites to bear it. When it was for the good of the people and for\nthe glory of God that they should pitch their tents in a certain place, [651]\nGod signified His will to them by causing the pillar of cloud to rest\ndirectly over the tabernacle, where it remained until He would have\nthem journey again. In all their journeyings they were required to\nobserve perfect order. Every tribe bore a standard with the sign of\ntheir father\u2019s house upon it, and each tribe was required to pitch\nunder its own standard. When the ark moved, the armies journeyed,\nthe different tribes marching in order, under their own standards.\nThe Levites were designated by the Lord as the tribe in the midst of\nwhom the sacred ark was to be borne, Moses and Aaron marching\njust in front of the ark, and the sons of Aaron following near them,\neach bearing trumpets. They were to receive directions from Moses,\nwhich they were to signify to the people by speaking through the\ntrumpets. These trumpets gave special sounds which the people\nunderstood, and directed their movements accordingly.\nA special signal was first given by the trumpeters to call the\nattention of the people; then all were to be attentive and obey the\ncertain sound of the trumpets. There was no confusion of sound in\nthe voices of the trumpets, therefore there was no excuse for confu-\nsion in movements. The head officer of each company gave definite\ndirections in regard to the movements they were required to make,\nand none who gave attention were left in ignorance of what they\nwere to do. If any failed to comply with the requirements given by\nthe Lord to Moses, and by Moses to the people, they were punished\nwith death. It would be no excuse to plead that they knew not the\nnature of these requirements, for they would only prove themselves\nwillingly ignorant, and would receive the just punishment for their\ntransgression. If they did not know the will of God concerning them,\nit was their own fault. They had the same opportunities to obtain the\nknowledge imparted as others of the people had, therefore their sin\nof not knowing, not understanding, was as great in the sight of God\nas if they had heard and then transgressed.\nThe Lord designated a special family of the tribe of Levi to bear [652]\nthe ark; and others of the Levites were specially appointed of God\n614 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nto bear the tabernacle and all its furniture, and to perform the work\nof setting up and taking down the tabernacle. And if any man from\ncuriosity or from lack of order got out of his place and touched\nany part of the sanctuary or furniture, or even came near any of the\nworkmen, he was to be put to death. God did not leave His holy\ntabernacle to be borne, erected, and taken down, indiscriminately,\nby any tribe who might choose the office; but persons were chosen\nwho could appreciate the sacredness of the work in which they were\nengaged. These men appointed of God were directed to impress upon\nthe people the special sacredness of the ark and all that appertained\nthereunto, lest they should look upon these things without realizing\ntheir holiness and should be cut off from Israel. All things pertaining\nto the most holy place were to be looked upon with reverence.\nThe travels of the children of Israel are faithfully described; the\ndeliverance which the Lord wrought for them, their perfect organiza-\ntion and special order, their sin in murmuring against Moses and thus\nagainst God, their transgressions, their rebellions, their punishments,\ntheir carcasses strewn in the wilderness because of their unwilling-\nness to submit to God\u2019s wise arrangements\u2014this faithful picture\nis hung up before us as a warning lest we follow their example of\ndisobedience and fall like them.\n\u201cBut with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were\noverthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples,\nto the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.\nNeither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The\npeople sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. Neither let us\ncommit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day\nthree and twenty thousand. Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of\nthem also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents. Neither murmur[653]\nye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the\ndestroyer. Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples:\nand they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of\nthe world are come. Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth\ntake heed lest he fall.\u201d Has God changed from a God of order? No;\nHe is the same in the present dispensation as in the former. Paul\nsays: \u201cGod is not the author of confusion, but of peace.\u201d He is as\nparticular now as then. And He designs that we should learn lessons\nMinisters, Order, and Organization 615\nof order and organization from the perfect order instituted in the\ndays of Moses for the benefit of the children of Israel.\nChapter 113\u2014Further Labors\nExperiences from December 23, 1867 to February 1, 1868\nI will now resume the sketch of incidents, and perhaps I cannot\nbetter give an idea of our labors up to the time of the Vermont\nmeeting than by copying a letter which I wrote to our son at Battle\nCreek, December 27, 1867:\n\u201cMy dear son Edson,\n\u201cI am now seated at the desk of Brother D. T. Bourdeau, at West\nEnosburgh, Vermont. After our meeting closed at Topsham, Maine,\nI was exceedingly weary. While packing my trunk, I nearly fainted\nfrom weariness. The last work I did there was to call Brother A\u2019s\nfamily together and have a special interview with them. I spoke to\nthis dear family, giving words of exhortation and comfort, also of\ncorrection and counsel to one connected with them. All I said was\nfully received and was followed by confession, weeping, and great\nrelief to Brother and Sister A. This is crossing work for me and\nwears me much.\n\u201cAfter we were seated in the cars, I lay down and rested about\none hour. We had an appointment that evening at West-brook, Maine,\nto meet the brethren from Portland and vicinity. We made our home[654]\nwith the kind family of Brother Martin. I was not able to sit up\nduring the afternoon; but, being urged to attend the meeting in the\nevening, I went to the schoolhouse, feeling that I had not strength\nto stand and address the people. The house was filled with deeply\ninterested listeners. Brother Andrews opened the meeting, and spoke\na short time; your father followed with remarks. I then arose, and\nhad spoken but a few words, when I felt my strength renewed; all\nmy feebleness seemed to leave me, and I spoke about one hour with\nperfect freedom. I felt inexpressible gratitude for this help from God\nat the very time when I so much needed it. On Wednesday evening\nI spoke with freedom nearly two hours upon the health and dress\nreforms. To have my strength so unexpectedly renewed, when I had\n616\nFurther Labors 617\nfelt completely exhausted before these two meetings, has been a\nsource of great encouragement to me.\n\u201cWe enjoyed our visit with the family of Brother Martin, and\nhope to see their dear children give their hearts to Christ, and with\ntheir parents war the Christian warfare, and wear the crown of im-\nmortality when the victory shall be gained.\n\u201cThursday we went into Portland again and took dinner with the\nfamily of Brother Gowell. We had a special interview with them,\nwhich we hope will result in their good. We feel a deep interest for\nthe wife of Brother Gowell. This mother\u2019s heart has been torn by\nseeing her children in affliction and in death, and laid in the silent\ngrave. It is well with the sleepers. May the mother yet seek all the\ntruth, and lay up a treasure in heaven, that when the Life-giver shall\ncome to bring the captives from the great prison house of death,\nfather, mother, and children may meet, and the broken links of the\nfamily chain be reunited, no more to be severed.\n\u201cBrother Gowell took us to the cars in his carriage. We had just\ntime to get on the train before it started. We rode five hours, and\nfound Brother A. W. Smith at the Manchester depot, waiting to take\nus to his home in that city. Here we expected to find rest one night; [655]\nbut, lo quite a number were waiting to receive us. They had come\nnine miles from Amherst to spend the evening with us. We had a\nvery pleasant interview, profitable, we hope, to all. Retired about\nten. Early next morning we left the comfortable, hospitable home of\nBrother Smith, to pursue our journey to Washington. It was a slow,\ntedious route. We left the cars at Hillsborough, and found a team\nwaiting to take us twelve miles to Washington. Brother Colby had a\nsleigh and blankets, and we rode quite comfortably until we were\nwithin a few miles of our destination. There was not snow enough to\nmake good sleighing; the wind arose, and during the last two miles\nblew the falling sleet into our faces and eyes, producing pain and\nchilling us almost to freezing. We found shelter at last at the good\nhome of Brother C. K. Farnsworth. They did all they could for our\ncomfort, and everything was arranged so that we could rest as much\nas possible. That was but little, I can assure you.\n\u201cSabbath your father spoke in the forenoon, and after an inter-\nmission of about twenty minutes I spoke, bearing a testimony of\nreproof for several who were using tobacco, also for Brother Ball,\n618 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwho had been strengthening the hands of our enemies by holding the\nvisions up to ridicule, and publishing bitter things against us in the\nCrisis, of Boston, and in the Hope of Israel, a paper issued in Iowa.\nThe meeting for the evening was appointed at Brother Farnsworth\u2019s.\nThe church was present, and your father there requested Brother\nBall to state his objections to the visions and give an opportunity\nto answer them. Thus the evening was spent. Brother Ball mani-\nfested much stiffness and opposition; he admitted himself satisfied\nupon some points, but held his position quite firmly. Brother An-\ndrews and your father talked plainly, explaining matters which he\nhad misunderstood, and condemning his unrighteous course toward\nthe Sabbathkeeping Adventists. We all felt that we had done the best\nwe could that day to weaken the forces of the enemy. Our meeting[656]\nheld until past ten.\n\u201cThe next morning we attended meetings again in the meeting-\nhouse. Your father spoke in the morning. But just before he spoke,\nthe enemy made a poor, weak brother feel that he had a most as-\ntonishing burden for the church. He walked the slip, talked, and\ngroaned, and cried, and had a terrible something upon him, which\nnobody seemed to understand. We were trying to bring those who\nprofessed the truth to see their state of dreadful darkness and back-\nsliding before God, and to make humble confessions of the same,\nthus returning unto the Lord with sincere repentance, that He might\nreturn unto them, and heal their backslidings. Satan sought to hinder\nthe work by pushing in this poor, distracted soul to disgust those who\nwished to move understandingly. I arose and bore a plain testimony\nto this man. He had taken no food for two days, and Satan had\ndeceived him, and pushed him over the mark.\n\u201cThen your father preached. We had a few moments\u2019 intermis-\nsion, and then I tried to speak upon the health and dress reforms,\nand bore a plain testimony to those who had been standing in the\nway of the young and of unbelievers. God helped me to say plain\nthings to Brother Ball, and to tell him in the name of the Lord what\nhe had been doing. He was considerably affected.\n\u201cAgain we held an evening meeting at Brother Farnsworth\u2019s.\nThe weather was stormy during the meetings, yet Brother Ball did\nnot remain away from one of them. The same subject was resumed,\nthe investigation of the course he had pursued. If ever the Lord\nFurther Labors 619\nhelped a man talk, He helped Brother Andrews that night, as he\ndwelt upon the subject of suffering for Christ\u2019s sake. The case of\nMoses was mentioned, who refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s\ndaughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of\nGod than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season, esteeming the\nreproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he [657]\nhad respect unto the recompense of reward. He showed that this is\none of many instances where the reproach of Christ was esteemed\nabove worldly riches and honor, high-sounding titles, a prospective\ncrown, and the glory of a kingdom. The eye of faith was fixed\nupon the glorious future, and the recompense of the reward was\nregarded of such value as to cause the richest things which earth can\noffer to appear valueless. The children of God endured mockings,\nscourgings, bonds, and imprisonments; they were stoned, sawn\nasunder, tempted, wandering about in sheepskins and goatskins,\ndestitute, afflicted, tormented, and, sustained by hope and faith,\nthey could call these light afflictions; the future, the eternal life,\nappeared of so great value that they accounted their sufferings small\nin comparison with the recompense of the reward.\n\u201cBrother Andrews related an instance of a faithful Christian\nabout to suffer martyrdom for his faith. A brother Christian had been\nconversing with him in regard to the power of the Christian hope\u2014if\nit would be strong enough to sustain him while his flesh should be\nconsuming with fire. He asked this Christian, about to suffer, to give\nhim a signal if the Christian faith and hope were stronger than the\nraging, consuming fire. He expected his turn to come next, and this\nwould fortify him for the fire. The former promised that the signal\nshould be given. He was brought to the stake amid the taunts and\njeers of the idle and curious crowd assembled to witness the burning\nof this Christian. The fagots were brought and the fire kindled, and\nthe brother Christian fixed his eyes upon the suffering, dying martyr,\nfeeling that much depended upon the signal. The fire burned, and\nburned. The flesh was blackened; but the signal came not. His eye\nwas not taken for a moment from the painful sight. The arms were\nalready crisped. There was no appearance of life. All thought that\nthe fire had done its work, and that no life remained; when, lo! amid\nthe flames, up went both arms toward heaven. The brother Christian, [658]\nwhose heart was becoming faint, caught sight of the joyful signal;\n620 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nit sent a thrill through his whole being, and renewed his faith, his\nhope, his courage. He wept tears of joy.\n\u201cAs Brother Andrews spoke of the blackened, burned arms raised\naloft amid the flames, he, too, wept like a child. Nearly the whole\ncongregation were affected to tears. This meeting closed about ten.\nThere had been quite a breaking away of the clouds of darkness.\nBrother Hemingway arose and said he had been completely back-\nslidden, using tobacco, opposing the visions, and persecuting his\nwife for believing them, but said he would do so no more. He asked\nher forgiveness, and the forgiveness of us all. His wife spoke with\nfeeling. His daughter and several others rose for prayers. He stated\nthat the testimony which Sister White had borne seemed to come\ndirect from the throne, and he would never dare to oppose it again.\n\u201cBrother Ball then said that if matters were as we viewed them,\nhis case was very bad. He said he knew he had been backslidden\nfor years and had stood in the way of the young. We thanked God\nfor that admission. We designed to leave early Monday morning,\nand had an appointment at Braintree, Vermont, to meet about thirty\nSabbathkeepers. But it was very cold, rough, blustering weather\nto ride twenty-five miles after such constant labor, and we finally\ndecided to hold on, and continue the work in Washington until\nBrother Ball decided either for or against the truth, that the church\nmight be relieved in his case.\n\u201cMeeting commenced Monday at 10 a.m. Brethren Rodman and\nHoward were present. Brother Newell Mead, who was very feeble\nand nervous, almost exactly like your father in his past sickness, was\nsent for to attend the meeting. Again the condition of the church was\ndwelt upon, and the severest censure was passed upon those who had\nstood in the way of its prosperity. With the most earnest entreaties[659]\nwe pleaded with them to be converted to God and face rightabout.\nThe Lord aided us in the work; Brother Ball felt, but moved slowly.\nHis wife felt deeply for him. Our morning meeting closed at three\nor four in the afternoon. All these hours we had been engaged, first\none of us, then another, earnestly laboring for the unconverted youth.\nWe appointed another meeting for the evening, to commence at six.\n\u201cJust before going into the meeting, I had a revival of some\ninteresting scenes which had passed before me in vision, and I\nspoke to Brethren Andrews, Rodman, Howard, Mead, and several\nFurther Labors 621\nothers who were present. It seemed to me that the angels were\nmaking a rift in the cloud and letting in the beams of light from\nheaven. The subject that was presented so strikingly was the case\nof Moses. I exclaimed: \u2018Oh, that I had the skill of an artist, that\nI might picture the scene of Moses upon the mount!\u2019 His strength\nwas firm. \u2018Unabated,\u2019 is the language of the Scripture. His eye was\nnot dimmed through age, yet he was upon that mount to die. The\nangels buried him, but the Son of God soon came down and raised\nhim from the dead and took him to heaven. But God first gave him\na view of the land of promise, with His blessing upon it. It was\nas it were a second Eden. As a panorama this passed before his\nvision. He was shown the appearing of Christ at His first advent, His\nrejection by the Jewish nation, and His death upon the cross. Moses\nthen saw Christ\u2019s second advent and the resurrection of the just. I\nalso spoke of the meeting of the two Adams\u2014Adam the first, and\nChrist the second Adam\u2014when Eden shall bloom on earth again.\nThe particulars of these interesting points I design to write out for\nTestimony No. 14. The brethren wished me to repeat the same in the\nevening meeting.\n\u201cOur meeting through the day had been most solemn. I had such\na burden upon me Sunday evening that I wept aloud for about half [660]\nan hour. Monday, solemn appeals had been made, and the Lord\nwas sending them home. I went into meeting Tuesday evening a\nlittle lighter. I spoke an hour with great freedom upon subjects I\nhad seen in vision, which I have referred to. Our meeting was very\nfree. Brother Howard wept like a child, as did also Brother Rodman.\nBrother Andrews talked in an earnest, touching manner, and with\nweeping. Brother Ball arose and said that there seemed to be two\nspirits about him that evening, one saying to him: Can you doubt\nthat this testimony from Sister White is of heaven? Another spirit\nwould present before his mind the objections he had opened before\nthe enemies of our faith. \u2018Oh, if I could feel satisfied,\u2019 said he, \u2018in\nregard to all these objections, if they could be removed, I would feel\nthat I had done Sister White a great injury. I have recently sent a\npiece to the Hope of Israel. If I had that piece, what would I not\ngive!\u2019 He felt deeply, and wept much. The Spirit of the Lord was in\nthe meeting. Angels of God seemed drawing very near, driving back\nthe evil angels. Minister and people wept like children. We felt that\n622 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwe had gained ground, and that the powers of darkness had given\nback. Our meeting closed well.\n\u201cWe appointed still another meeting for the next day, commenc-\ning at 10 a.m. I spoke upon the humiliation and glorification of\nChrist. Brother Ball sat near me and wept all the time I was talking.\nI spoke about an hour, then we commenced our labors for the youth.\nParents had come to the meeting bringing their children with them to\nreceive the blessing. Brother Ball arose and made humble confession\nthat he had not lived as he should before his family. He confessed to\nhis children and to his wife that he had been in a backslidden state,\nand had been no help to them, but rather a hindrance. Tears flowed\nfreely; his strong frame shook, and sobs choked his utterance.\n\u201cBrother James Farnsworth had been influenced by Brother Ball,\nand had not been in full union with the Sabbathkeeping Adventists.[661]\nHe confessed with tears. Then we pleaded earnestly with the chil-\ndren, until thirteen arose and expressed a desire to be Christians.\nBrother Ball\u2019s children were among the number. One or two had left\nthe meeting, being obliged to return home. One young man, about\ntwenty years old, walked forty miles to see us and hear the truth.\nHe had never professed religion, but took his stand on the Lord\u2019s\nside before he left. This was one of the very best of meetings. At its\nclose, Brother Ball came to your father and confessed with tears that\nhe had wronged him, and entreated his forgiveness. He next came\nto me and confessed that he had done me a great injury. \u2018Can you\nforgive me and pray God to forgive me?\u2019 We assured him we would\nforgive him as freely as we hoped to be forgiven. We parted with all\nwith many tears, feeling the blessing of heaven resting upon us. We\nhad no meeting in the evening.\n\u201cThursday we arose at 4 a.m. It had rained in the night and\nwas still raining, yet we ventured to start to ride to Bellows Falls, a\ndistance of twenty-five miles. The first four miles was exceedingly\nrough, as we took a private track through the fields to escape steep\nhills. We rode over stones and plowed ground, nearly throwing us\nout of the sleigh. About sunrise the storm cleared away, and we had\nvery good sleighing when we reached the public road. The weather\nwas very mild; we never had a more beautiful day to travel. On\narriving at Bellows Falls, we found that we were one hour too late\nfor the express train, and one hour too early for the accommodation\nFurther Labors 623\ntrain. We could not get to St. Albans until nine in the evening. We\ntook seats in a nice car, then took our dinner, and enjoyed our simple\nfare. We then prepared to sleep if we could.\n\u201cWhile I was sleeping, someone shook my shoulder quite vigor-\nously. I looked up, and saw a pleasant-looking lady bending over\nme. Said she: \u2018Don\u2019t you know me? I am Sister Chase. The cars\nare at White River. Stop only a few moments. I live just by here, [662]\nand have come down every day this week and been through the cars\nto meet you.\u2019 I then remembered that I took dinner at her house at\nNewport. She was so glad to see us. Her mother and she keep the\nSabbath alone. Her husband is conductor on the cars. She talked\nfast. Said she prized the Review much, as she had no meeting to\nattend. She wanted books to distribute to her neighbors, but had to\nearn all the money herself which she expended for books or for the\npaper. We had a profitable interview, although short, for the cars\nstarted, and we had to separate.\n\u201cAt St. Albans we found Brethren Gould and A.C. Bourdeau.\nBrother B. had a convenient covered carriage and two horses, but he\ndrove very slowly, and we did not reach Enosburgh until past one\nin the morning. We were weary and chilled. We lay down to rest a\nlittle after two o\u2019clock and slept until after seven.\n\u201cSabbath morning. There is quite a large gathering here although\nthe roads are bad, neither sleighing nor good wagoning. I have just\nbeen in meeting and occupied a little time in conference. Your father\nspeaks this morning, I in the afternoon. May the Lord help us, is\nour prayer. You see how long a letter I have written you. Read this\nto those who are interested, especially to father and mother White.\nYou see, Edson, that we have work enough to do. I hope you do not\nneglect to pray for us. Your father works hard, too hard for his good.\nHe sometimes realizes the special blessing of God, and this renews\nhim and cheers him in the work. We have allowed ourselves no rest\nsince coming East; we have labored with all our strength. May our\nfeeble efforts be blessed to the good of God\u2019s dear people.\n\u201cEdson, I hope that you will adorn your profession by a well-\nordered life and godly conversation. Oh, be earnest! be zealous and\npersevering in the work. Watch unto prayer. Cultivate humility and\nmeekness. This will meet the approval of God. Hide yourself in [663]\nJesus; let self-love and self-pride be sacrificed, and you, my son, be\n624 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nfitting with a rich Christian experience, to be of use in any position\nthat God may require you to occupy. Seek for thorough heartwork.\nA surface work will not stand the test of the judgment. Seek for\nthorough transformation from the world. Let not your hands be\nstained, your heart spotted, your character sullied, by its corruptions.\nKeep distinct. God calls: \u2018Come out from among them, and be ye\nseparate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will\nreceive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons\nand daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.\u2019 \u2018Having therefore these\npromises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness\nof the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.\u2019\n\u201cThe work rests upon us to perfect holiness. When God sees us\ndoing all we can on our part, then He will help us. Angels will aid\nus, and we shall be strong through Christ strengthening us. Do not\nneglect secret prayer. Pray for yourself. Grow in grace. Advance.\nDon\u2019t stand still, don\u2019t go back. Onward to victory. Courage in\nthe Lord, my dear boy. Battle with the great adversary only a little\nlonger, and then release will come, and the armor will be laid off\nat the feet of our dear Redeemer. Press through every obstacle. If\nthe future looks somewhat clouded, hope on, believe on. The clouds\nwill disappear, and light again shine. Praise God, my heart says,\npraise God for what He has done for you, for your father, and for\nmyself. Commence the new year right. Your mother, E.G.W.\u201d\nThe meeting at West Enosburgh, Vermont, was one of deep\ninterest. It seemed good to again meet with, and speak to, our old,\ntried friends in this state. A great and good work was done in a short\ntime. These friends were generally poor and toiling for the comforts\nof life where one dollar is earned with more labor than two in the\nWest, yet they were liberal with us. Many particulars of this meeting[664]\nhave been given in the Review, and want of room in these pages\nalone seems to forbid their repetition. In no state have the brethren\nbeen truer to the cause than in old Vermont.\nOn our way from Enosburgh, we stopped for the night with\nthe family of Brother William White. Brother C. A. White, his\nson, introduced to us the matter of his Combined Patent Washer\nand Wringer, and wished counsel. As I had written against our\npeople engaging in patent rights, he wished to know just how I\nviewed his patent. I freely told him what I did not mean in what I\nFurther Labors 625\nhad written, and also what I did mean. I did not mean that it was\nwrong to have anything to do with patent rights, for this is almost\nimpossible, as very many things with which we have to do daily are\npatented. Neither did I wish to convey the idea that it was wrong to\npatent, manufacture, and sell any article worthy of being patented. I\ndid mean to be understood that it is wrong for our people to suffer\nthemselves to be so imposed upon, deceived, and cheated by those\nmen who go about the country selling the right of territory for this\nor that machine or article. Many of these are of no value, as they are\nno real improvement. And those who are engaged in their sale, are,\nwith few exceptions, a class of deceivers.\nAnd, again, some of our own people have engaged in the sale of\npatented wares which they had reason to believe were not what they\nrepresented them to be. That so many of our people, some of them\nafter being fully warned, will still suffer themselves to be deceived\nby the false statements of these vendors of patent rights, seems\nastonishing. Some patents are really valuable, and a few have made\nwell on them. But it is my opinion that where one dollar has been\ngained, one hundred dollars have been lost. No reliance whatever\ncan be placed on these patent-right pledges. And the fact that those\nengaged in them are, with few exceptions, downright deceivers and\nliars, makes it hard for an honest man, who has a worthy article, to [665]\nobtain the credit and patronage due him.\nBrother White exhibited his Combined Washer and Wringer\nbefore the company, including the Brethren Bourdeau, Brother An-\ndrews, my husband, and myself, and we could but look with favor\nupon it. He has since made us a present of one, which Brother\nCorliss from Maine, our hired man, in a few moments put together\nin running order. Sister Burgess, from Gratiot County, our hired girl,\nis very much pleased with it. It does the work well, and very fast. A\nfeeble woman who has a son or husband to work this machine, can\nhave a large washing done in a few hours, and she do but little more\nthan oversee the work. Brother White sent circulars, which any can\nhave by addressing us, enclosing postage.\nOur next meeting was at Adams Center, New York. It was a\nlarge gathering. There were several persons in and around this\nplace whose cases had been shown me, for whom I felt the deepest\ninterest. They were men of moral worth. Some were in positions in\n626 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nlife which made the cross of present truth heavy to bear, or, at least,\nthey thought so. Others, who had reached the middle age of life, had\nbeen brought up from childhood to keep the Sabbath, but had not\nborne the cross of Christ. These were in a position where it seemed\nhard to move them. They needed to be shaken from relying on their\ngood works and to be brought to feel their lost condition without\nChrist. We could not give up these souls, and labored with our might\nto help them. They were at last moved, and I have since been made\nglad to hear from some of them, and good news respecting all of\nthem. We hope that the love of this world will not shut the love of\nGod out of their hearts. God is converting strong men of wealth and\nbringing them into the ranks. If they would prosper in the Christian\nlife, grow in grace, and at last reap a rich reward, they will have to\nuse of their abundance to advance the cause of truth.\nAfter leaving Adams Center, we stayed a few days at Rochester,[666]\nand from that place came to Battle Creek, where we remained over\nSabbath and first day. Thence we returned to our home, where we\nspent the next Sabbath and first day with the brethren who assembled\nfrom different places.\nMy husband had taken hold of the book matter at Battle Creek,\nand a noble example had been set by that church. At the meeting at\nFairplains he presented the matter of placing in the hands of all who\nwere not able to purchase, such works as Spiritual Gifts, Appeal to\nMothers, How to Live, Appeal to Youth, Sabbath Readings, and the\ncharts, with Key of Explanation. The plan met with general approval.\nBut of this important work I will speak in another place.\n* * * * *\nChapter 114\u2014The Case of Hannah More\nThe next Sabbath we met with the Orleans church, where my\nhusband introduced the case of our much-lamented sister, Hannah\nMore. When Brother Amadon visited us last summer, he stated that\nSister More had been at Battle Creek, and not finding employment\nthere, had gone to Leelenaw County to find a home with an old\nfriend who had been a fellow laborer in missionary fields in Central\nAfrica. My husband and myself felt grieved that this dear servant of\nChrist found it necessary to deprive herself of the society of those of\nlike faith, and we decided to send for her to come and find a home\nwith us. We wrote inviting her to meet us at our appointment at\nWright, and come home with us. She did not meet us at Wright. I\nhere give her response to our letter, dated August 29, 1867, which\nwe received at Battle Creek:\n\u201cBrother White: Your kind communication reached me by this\nweek\u2019s mail. As the mail comes here only once a week, and is to\nleave tomorrow, I hasten to reply. We are here in the bush, as it [667]\nwere, and an Indian carries the mail Fridays on foot, and returns\nTuesdays. I have consulted Brother Thompson as to the route, and\nhe says my best and surest way will be to take a boat from here and\ngo to Milwaukee, and thence to Grand Haven.\n\u201cAs I spent all my money in coming here, and was invited to\nhave a home in Brother Thompson\u2019s family, I have been assisting\nSister Thompson in her domestic affairs and sewing, at one dollar\nand fifty cents per week of five days each, as they do not wish me\nto work for them on Sunday, and I do not work on the Sabbath of\nthe Lord, the only one the Bible recognizes. They are not at all\nanxious to have me leave them, notwithstanding our difference of\nbelief; and he says I may have a home with them, only I must not\nmake my belief prominent among his people. He has even invited\nme to fill his appointments when on his preaching tour, and I have\ndone so. Sister Thompson needs a governess for her children, as the\ninfluences are so very pernicious outside, and the schools so vicious\n627\n628 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nthat she is not willing to send her dear ones among them until they\nare Christians, as she says. Their eldest son, today sixteen years of\nage, is a pious and devoted young man. They have partially adopted\nthe health reform, and I think will fully come into it erelong, and\nlike it. He has ordered the Health Reformer. I showed him some\ncopies which I brought.\n\u201cI hope and pray that he may yet embrace the holy Sabbath.\nSister Thompson does believe in it already. He is wonderfully set\nin his own ways, and of course thinks he is right. Could I only get\nhim to read the books I brought, the History of the Sabbath, etc.,\nbut he looks at them and calls them infidel, and says they seem\nto him to carry error in their front, when, if they would only read\ncarefully each sentiment of our tenets, I can but think they would\nembrace them as Bible truths and see their beauty and consistency. I\ndoubt not but that Sister T. would be glad to immediately become\na Seventh-day Adventist were it not that her husband is so bitterly[668]\nopposed to any such thing. It was impressed upon my mind that I\nhad a work to do here before I came here; but the truth is present\nin the family, and if I can carry it no farther, it would seem that my\nwork is done, or nearly so. I do not feel like being ashamed of Christ,\nor His, in this wicked generation, and would much rather cast in my\nlot with Sabbathkeepers and God\u2019s chosen people.\n\u201cI shall need ten dollars at least to get to Greenville. That, with\nthe little I have earned, might be sufficient. But now I will wait for\nyou to write me, and do what you think best about forwarding me\nthe money. In the spring I would have enough to go, myself, and\nthink I should like to do so. May the Lord guide and bless us in\nour every undertaking, is the ardent desire of my heart. And may I\nfill that very position my God allots for me in his moral vineyard,\nperforming with alacrity every duty, however onerous it may seem,\naccording to his good pleasure, is my sincere desire and heartfelt\nprayer.\n\u201cHannah More.\u201d\nOn receiving this letter, we decided to send the needed sum to\nSister More as soon as we could find time. But before we found\nthe spare moments we decided to go to Maine, to return in a few\nCase of Hannah More 629\nweeks, when we could send for her before navigation should close.\nAnd when we decided to stay and labor in Maine, New Hampshire,\nVermont, and New York, we wrote to a brother in this county to see\nleading brethren in the vicinity and consult with them concerning\nsending for Sister More and making her a home until we should\nreturn. But the matter was neglected until navigation closed, and\nwe returned and found that no one had taken interest to help Sister\nMore to this vicinity, where she could come to us when we should\nreach our home. We felt grieved and distressed, and at a meeting\nat Orleans the second Sabbath after we came home, my husband\nintroduced her case to the brethren. A brief report of what was said [669]\nand done in relation to Sister More was given by my husband in the\nReview for February 18, 1868, as follows:\n\u201cAt this meeting we introduced the case of Sister Hannah More,\nnow sojourning in northwestern Michigan with friends who do not\nobserve the Bible Sabbath. We stated that this servant of Christ\nembraced the Sabbath while performing missionary labor in Central\nAfrica. When this was known, her services in that direction were\nno longer wanted, and she returned to America to seek a home and\nemployment with those of like faith. We judge, from her present\nlocation, that in this she has been disappointed. No one in particular\nmay be worthy of blame in her case; but it appears to us that there\nis either a lack of suitable provisions connected with our system of\norganization, for the encouragement of such persons and to assist\nthem to a field of useful labor, or that those brethren and sisters who\nhave had the pleasure of seeing Sister More have not done their duty.\nA unanimous vote was then given to invite her to find a home with\nthe brethren in this vicinity until General Conference, when her case\nshould be presented to our people. Brother Andrews, being present,\nfully endorsed the action of the brethren.\u201d\nFrom what we have since learned of the cold, indifferent treat-\nment which Sister More met with at Battle Creek, it is evident that\nin stating that no one in particular was worthy of censure in her\ncase, my husband took altogether a too charitable view of the mat-\nter. When all the facts are known, no Christian could but blame\nall members of that church who knew her circumstances and did\nnot individually interest themselves in her behalf. It certainly was\nthe duty of the officers to do this and report to the church, if others\n630 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ndid not take up the matter before them. But individual members\nof that or any other church should not feel excused from taking an\ninterest in such persons. After what has been said in the Review of[670]\nthis self-sacrificing servant of Christ, every reader of the Review in\nBattle Creek, on learning that she had come to the city, would have\nbeen excused for giving her a personal call and inquiring into her\nwants.\nSister Strong, the wife of Elder P. Strong, Jr., was in Battle Creek\nat the same time as Sister More. They both reached that city the same\nday, and left at the same time. Sister Strong, who is by my side, says\nthat Sister More wished her to intercede for her, that she might get\nemployment, so as to remain with Sabbathkeepers. Sister More said\nshe was willing to do anything, but teaching was her choice. She\nalso requested Elder A. S. Hutchins to introduce her case to leading\nbrethren at the Review office and try to get a school for her. This,\nBrother Hutchins cheerfully did. But no encouragement was given,\nas there appeared to be no opening. She also stated to Sister Strong\nthat she was destitute of means and must go to Leelenaw County\nunless she could get employment at Battle Creek. She frequently\nspoke in words of touching lamentation that she was obliged to leave\nthe brethren.\nSister More wrote to Mr. Thompson relative to accepting his\noffer to make it her home with his family, and she wished to wait\nuntil she should hear from him. Sister Strong went with her to find\na place for her to stay until she should hear from Mr. T. At one\nplace she was told that she could stay from Wednesday until Friday\nmorning, when they were to leave home. This sister made Sister\nMore\u2019s case known to her natural sister, living near, who was also\na Sabbathkeeper. When she returned she told Sister More that she\ncould stay with her until Friday morning; that her sister said it was\nnot convenient to take her. Sister Strong has since learned that the\nreal excuse was that she was not acquainted with Sister More. She\ncould have taken her, but did not want her.\nSister More then asked Sister Strong what she should do. Sister\nStrong was almost a stranger in Battle Creek, but thought she could[671]\nget her in with the family of a poor brother of her acquaintance who\nhad recently moved from Montcalm County. Here she succeeded.\nSister More remained until Tuesday, when she left for Leelenaw\nCase of Hannah More 631\nCounty by the way of Chicago. There she borrowed money to\ncomplete her journey. Her wants were known to some, at least, in\nBattle Creek, for as the result of their being made known, she was\ncharged nothing for her brief stay at the Institute.\nImmediately after our return from the East, my husband, learning\nthat nothing had been done, as we had requested, to get Sister More\nwhere she could at once come to us on our return, wrote to her to\ncome to us as soon as possible, to which she responded as follows:\n\u201cLeland, Leelenaw County, Michigan,\nFebruary 20, 1868.\n\u201cMy dear Brother White: Yours of February 3 is received. It\nfound me in poor health, not being accustomed to these cold northern\nwinters, with the snow three or four feet deep on a level. Our mails\nare brought on snowshoes.\n\u201cIt does not seem possible for me to get to you till spring opens.\nThe roads are bad enough without snow. They tell me my best way\nis to wait till navigation opens, then go to Milwaukee, and thence\nto Grand Haven, to take the railroad to the point nearest your place.\nI had hoped to get among our dear people last fall, but was not\npermitted the privilege.\n\u201cThe truths which we believe seem more and more important,\nand our work of making ready a people prepared for the Lord\u2019s\ncoming is not to be delayed. We must not only have on the wedding\ngarment ourselves, but be faithful in recommending the preparation\nto others. I wish I could get to you, but it seems impossible, or at\nleast impracticable, in my delicate state of health to set out alone\non such a journey in the depth of winter. When is the General\nConference to which you allude? And where? I suppose the Review [672]\nwill eventually inform me.\n\u201cI think my health has suffered from keeping the Sabbath alone\nin my chamber, in the cold; but I did not think I could keep it where\nall manner of work and worldly conversation was the order of the\nday, as with Sundaykeepers. I think it is the most laborious working\nday with those who keep first day. Indeed, it does not seem to me\nthat the best of Sundaykeepers observe any day as they should. Oh,\nhow I long to be again with Sabbathkeepers! Sister White will want\nto see me in the reform dress. Will she be so kind as to send me a\npattern, and I will pay her when I get there. I suppose I shall need to\n632 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nbe fitted out when I get among you. I like it much. Sister Thompson\nthinks she would like to wear the reform dress.\n\u201cI have had a difficulty in breathing, so that I have not been\nable to sleep for more than a week, occasioned, I suppose, by the\nstovepipe\u2019s parting and completely filling my room with smoke and\ngas at bedtime, and my sleeping there without proper ventilation.\nI did not, at the time, suppose smoke was so unwholesome, nor\nconsider that the impure gas which generated from the wood and\ncoal was mingled with it. I awoke with such a sense of suffocation\nthat I could not breathe lying down, and spent the remainder of\nthe night sitting up. I never before knew the dreadful feeling of\nstifling sensations. I began to fear I should never sleep again. I\ntherefore resigned myself into the hands of God for life or death,\nentreating him to spare me if he had any further need of me in his\nvineyard; otherwise I had no wish to live. I felt entirely reconciled\nto the hand of God upon me. But I also felt that satanic influences\nmust be resisted. I therefore bade Satan get behind me and away\nfrom me, and told the Lord that I would not turn my hand over to\nchoose either life or death, but that I would refer it implicitly to\nHim who knew me altogether. My future was unknown to myself,\ntherefore said I, Thy will is best. Life is of no account to me, so far[673]\nas its pleasures are concerned. All its riches, its honors, are nothing\ncompared with usefulness. I do not crave them; they cannot satisfy\nor fill the aching void which unperformed duty leaves to me. I would\nnot live uselessly, to be a mere blot or blank in life. And though it\nseems a martyr\u2019s death to die thus, I am resigned, if that is God\u2019s\nwill.\n\u201cI had said to Sister Thompson the day previous, \u2018Were I at\nBrother White\u2019s, I might be prayed for, and healed.\u2019 She inquired\nif we could send for you and Brother Andrews; but that seemed\nimpracticable, as I could not, in all probability, live till you arrived.\nI knew that the Lord by His mighty power and with His potent arm\ncould heal me here, were it best. To Him I felt safe in referring it.\nI knew He could send an angel to resist him that hath the power\nof death, that is, the devil, and felt sure He would, if best.

      "text": "She being dead yet speaketh. Her letters, which I have given,\nwill be read with deep interest by those who have read her obituary\nin a recent number of the Review. She might have been a blessing to\nany Sabbathkeeping family who could appreciate her worth, but she\nsleeps. Our brethren at Battle Creek and in this vicinity could have\nmade more than a welcome home for Jesus, in the person of this\ngodly woman. But that opportunity is past. It was not convenient.\nThey were not acquainted with her. She was advanced in years and\nmight be a burden. Feelings of this kind barred her from the homes of\nthe professed friends of Jesus, who are looking for His near advent,\nand drove her away from those she loved, to those who opposed\nher faith, to northern Michigan, in the cold of winter, to be chilled\nto death. She died a martyr to the selfishness and covetousness of\nprofessed commandment keepers.\nProvidence has administered, in this case, a terrible rebuke for[675]\nthe conduct of those who did not take this stranger in. She was not\nreally a stranger. By reputation she was known, and yet she was not\ntaken in. Many will feel sad as they think of Sister More as she stood\nin Battle Creek, begging a home there with the people of her choice.\nAnd as they, in imagination, follow her to Chicago, to borrow money\nto meet the expenses of the journey to her final resting place,\u2014and\nwhen they think of that grave in Leelenaw County, where rests this\nprecious outcast,\u2014God pity those who are guilty in her case.\nPoor Sister More! She sleeps, but we did what we could. When\nwe were at Battle Creek, the last of August, we received the first of\nthe two letters I have given, but we had no money to send her. My\nhusband sent to Wisconsin and Iowa for means, and received seventy\ndollars to bear our expenses to those western convocations, held last\nSeptember. We hoped to have means to send to her immediately on\nour return from the West, to pay her expenses to our new home in\nMontcalm County.\nCase of Hannah More 635\nThe liberal friends West had given us the needed means; but when\nwe decided to accompany Brother Andrews to Maine, the matter\nwas deferred until we should return. We did not expect to be in the\nEast more than four weeks, which would have given ample time to\nsend for Sister More after our return, and to get her to our house\nbefore navigation should close. And when we decided to remain in\nthe East several weeks longer than we first designed, we lost no time\nin addressing several brethren in this vicinity, recommending that\nthey send for Sister More and give her a home till we should return.\nI say: We did what we could.\nBut why should we feel interested in this sister, more than others?\nWhat did we want of this worn-out missionary? She could not do\nour housework, and we had but one child at home for her to teach.\nAnd, certainly, much could not be expected of one worn as she was,\nwho had nearly reached three-score years. We had no use for her, in\nparticular, only to bring the blessing of God into our house. There [676]\nare many reasons why our brethren should have taken greater interest\nin the case of Sister More than we. We had never seen her, and had\nno other means of knowing her history, her devotion to the cause of\nChrist and humanity, than all the readers of theReview. Our brethren\nat Battle Creek had seen this noble woman, and some of them knew\nmore or less of her wishes and wants. We had no money with which\nto help her; they had. We were already overburdened with care and\nneeded those persons in our house who possessed the strength and\nbuoyancy of youth. We needed to be helped, instead of helping\nothers. But most of our brethren in Battle Creek are so situated that\nSister More would not have been the least care and burden. They\nhave time, strength, and comparative freedom from care.\nYet no one took the interest in her case that we did. I even\nspoke to the large congregation before we went East last fall, of their\nneglect of Sister More. I spoke of the duty of giving honor to whom\nit is due; it appeared to me that wisdom had so far departed from the\nprudent that they were not capable of appreciating moral worth. I\ntold that church that there were many among them who could find\ntime to meet, and sing, and play their instruments of music; they\ncould give their money to the artist to multiply their likenesses, or\ncould spend it to attend public amusements; but they had nothing\nto give to a worn-out missionary who had heartily embraced the\n636 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\npresent truth and had come to live with those of like precious faith. I\nadvised them to stop and consider what we were doing, and proposed\nthat they shut up their instruments of music for three months and\ntake time to humble themselves before God in self-examination,\nrepentance, and prayer until they learned the claims which the Lord\nhad upon them as His professed children. My soul was stirred with a\nsense of the wrong that had been done Jesus, in the person of Sister\nMore, and I talked personally with several about it.\nThis thing was not done in a corner. And yet, notwithstanding the[677]\nmatter was made public, followed by the great and good work in the\nchurch at Battle Creek, no effort was made by that church to redeem\nthe past by bringing Sister More back. And one, a wife of one of our\nministers, stated afterward: \u201cI do not see the need of Brother and\nSister White\u2019s making such a fuss about Sister More. I think they\ndo not understand the case.\u201d True, we did not understand the case.\nIt is much worse than we then supposed. If we had understood it,\nwe would never have left Battle Creek till we had fully set before\nthat church the sin of suffering her to leave them as she did, and\nmeasures had been taken to call her back.\nA member of that church in conversation about Sister More\u2019s\nleaving as she did, has since said in substance: \u201cNo one feels like\ntaking the responsibility of such cases now. Brother White always\ntook the charge of them.\u201d Yes, he did. He would take them to his\nown house till every chair and bed was full, then he would go to\nhis brethren and have them take those whom he could not. If they\nneeded means, he would give to them and invite others to follow his\nexample. There must be men in Battle Creek to do as he has done,\nor the curse of God will follow that church. Not one man only, there\nare fifty there who can do, more or less, as he has done.\nWe are told that we must come back to Battle Creek. This we\nare not ready to do. Probably this will never be our duty. We stood\nunder heavy burdens there till we could stand no longer. God will\nhave strong men and women there to divide these burdens among\nthem. Those who move to Battle Creek, who accept positions there,\nwho are not ready to put their hands to this kind of work, would a\nthousand times better be somewhere else. There are those who can\nsee and feel, and gladly do good to Jesus in the person of His saints.\nCase of Hannah More 637\nLet them have room to work. Let those who cannot do this go where\nthey will not stand in the way of the work of God.\nEspecially is this applicable to those who stand at the head of the [678]\nwork. If they go wrong, all is wrong. The greater the responsibility,\nthe greater the ruin in the case of unfaithfulness. If leading brethren\ndo not faithfully perform their duty, those who are led will not\ndo theirs. Those at the head of the work at Battle Creek must be\nensamples to the flock everywhere. If they do this, they will have a\ngreat reward. If they fail to do this, and yet accept such positions,\nthey will have a fearful account to give.\nWe did what we could. If we could have had means at our\ncommand last summer and fall, Sister More would now be with us.\nWhen we learned our real circumstances, as set forth in Testimony\nNo. 13, we both took the matter joyfully and said we did not want\nthe responsibility of means. This was wrong. God wants that we\nshould have means that we may, as in time past, help where help is\nneeded. Satan wants to tie our hands in this respect and lead others\nto be careless, unfeeling, and covetous, that such cruel work may go\non as in the case of Sister More.\nWe see outcasts, widows, orphans, worthy poor, and ministers\nin want, and many chances to use means to the glory of God, the\nadvancement of His cause, and the relief of suffering saints, and I\nwant means to use for God. The experience of nearly a quarter of\na century in extensive traveling, feeling the condition of those who\nneed help, qualifies us to make a judicious use of our Lord\u2019s money.\nI have bought my own stationery, paid my own postage, and spent\nmuch of my life writing for the good of others, and all I have received\nfor this work, which has wearied and worn me terribly, would not\npay a tithe of my postage. When means has been pressed upon me,\nI have refused it, or appropriated it to such charitable objects as the\nPublishing Association. I shall do so no more. I shall do my duty in\nlabor as ever, but my fears of receiving means to use for the Lord\nare gone. This case of Sister More has fully aroused me to see the [679]\nwork of Satan in depriving us of means.\nPoor Sister More! When we heard that she was dead, my husband\nfelt terrible. We both felt as though a dear mother, for whose society\nour very hearts yearned, was no more. Some may say, If we had\nstood in the place of those who knew something of this sister\u2019s\n638 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nwishes and wants, we would not have done as they did. I hope you\nwill never have to suffer the stings of conscience which some must\nfeel who were so interested in their own affairs as to be unwilling to\nbear any responsibility in her case. May God pity those who are so\nafraid of deception as to neglect a worthy, self-sacrificing servant\nof Christ. The remark was made as an excuse for this neglect: We\nhave been bitten so many times that we are afraid of strangers. Did\nour Lord and His disciples instruct us to be very cautious and not\nentertain strangers, lest we should possibly make some mistake and\nget bitten by having the trouble of caring for an unworthy person?\nPaul exhorts the Hebrews: \u201cLet brotherly love continue.\u201d Do not\nflatter yourselves that there is a time when this exhortation will not\nbe needed; when brotherly love may cease. He continues: \u201cBe not\nforgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained\nangels unawares.\u201d Please read Matthew 25:31 and onward. Read\nit, brethren, the next time you take the Bible at your morning or\nevening family devotions. The good works performed by those who\nare to be welcomed to the kingdom were done to Christ in the person\nof His suffering people. Those who had done these good works did\nnot see that they had done anything for Christ. They had done no\nmore than their duty to suffering humanity. Those on the left hand\ncould not see that they had abused Christ in neglecting the wants of\nHis people. But they had neglected to do for Jesus in the person of\nHis saints, and for this neglect they were to go away into everlasting\npunishment. And one definite point of their neglect is thus stated: \u201cI[680]\nwas a stranger, and ye took Me not in.\u201d\nThese things do not belong alone to Battle Creek. I am grieved at\nthe selfishness among professed Sabbathkeepers everywhere. Christ\nhas gone to prepare eternal mansions for us, and shall we refuse Him\na home for only a few days, in the person of His saints who are cast\nout? He left His home in glory, His majesty and high command, to\nsave lost man. He became poor that we through His poverty might\nbecome rich. He submitted to insult, that man might be exalted,\nand provided a home that would be matchless for loveliness, and\nenduring as the throne of God. Those who finally overcome and sit\ndown with Christ upon His throne will follow the example of Jesus,\nand from a willing, happy choice will sacrifice for Him in the person\nCase of Hannah More 639\nof His saints. Those who cannot do this from choice will go away\ninto everlasting punishment.\n* * * * *\nChapter 115\u2014Healthful Cookery\nDuring the last seven months we have been at home but about\nfour weeks. In our travels we have sat at many different tables, from\nIowa to Maine. Some whom we have visited live up to the best light\nthey have. Others, who have the same opportunities of learning to\nlive healthfully and well, have hardly taken the first steps in reform.\nThey will tell you that they do not know how to cook in this new\nway. But they are without excuse in this matter of cooking; for in\nthe work, How to Live, are many excellent recipes, and this work\nis within the reach of all. I do not say that the system of cookery\ntaught in that book is perfect. I may soon furnish a small work more\nto my mind in some respects. But How to Live teaches cookery\nalmost infinitely in advance of what the traveler will often meet,\neven among some Seventh-day Adventists.\nMany do not feel that this is a matter of duty, hence they do not[681]\ntry to prepare food properly. This can be done in a simple, healthful,\nand easy manner, without the use of lard, butter, or flesh meats. Skill\nmust be united with simplicity. To do this, women must read, and\nthen patiently reduce what they read to practice. Many are suffering\nbecause they will not take the trouble to do this. I say to such: It\nis time for you to rouse your dormant energies and read up. Learn\nhow to cook with simplicity, and yet in a manner to secure the most\npalatable and healthful food.\nBecause it is wrong to cook merely to please the taste, or to suit\nthe appetite, no one should entertain the idea that an impoverished\ndiet is right. Many are debilitated with disease, and need a nourish-\ning, plentiful, well-cooked diet. We frequently find graham bread\nheavy, sour, and but partially baked. This is for want of interest to\nlearn, and care to perform, the important duty of cook. Sometimes\nwe find gem cakes, or soft biscuit, dried, not baked, and other things\nafter the same order. And then cooks will tell you they can do very\nwell in the old style of cooking, but, to tell the truth, their families\ndo not like graham bread; that they would starve to live in this way.\n640\nHealthful Cookery 641\nI have said to myself: I do not wonder at it. It is your manner\nof preparing food that makes it so unpalatable. To eat such food\nwould certainly give one the dyspepsia. These poor cooks, and\nthose who have to eat their food, will gravely tell you that the health\nreform does not agree with them. The stomach has not power to\nconvert poor, heavy, sour bread into good; but this poor bread will\nconvert a healthy stomach into a diseased one. Those who eat such\nfood know that they are failing in strength. Is there not a cause?\nSome of these persons call themselves health reformers, but they are\nnot. They do not know how to cook. They prepare cakes, potatoes,\nand graham bread, but there is the same round, with scarcely a\nvariation, and the system is not strengthened. They seem to think [682]\nthe time wasted which is devoted to obtaining a thorough experience\nin the preparation of healthful, palatable food. Some act as though\nthat which they eat were lost, and anything they could toss into the\nstomach to fill it would do as well as food prepared with so much\npainstaking. It is important that we relish the food we eat. If we\ncannot do this, but eat mechanically, we fail to be nourished and\nbuilt up as we would be if we could enjoy the food we take into the\nstomach. We are composed of what we eat. In order to make a good\nquality of blood, we must have the right kind of food, prepared in a\nright manner.\nIt is a religious duty for those who cook to learn how to prepare\nhealthful food in different ways, so that it may be eaten with enjoy-\nment. Mothers should teach their children how to cook. What branch\nof the education of a young lady can be so important as this? The\neating has to do with the life. Scanty, impoverished, ill-cooked food\nis constantly depraving the blood by weakening the blood-making\norgans. It is highly essential that the art of cookery be considered\none of the most important branches of education. There are but few\ngood cooks. Young ladies consider that it is stooping to a menial\noffice to become a cook. This is not the case. They do not view the\nsubject from a right standpoint. Knowledge of how to prepare food\nhealthfully, especially bread, is no mean science.\nIn many families we find dyspeptics, and frequently the reason\nof this is the poor bread. The mistress of the house decides that it\nmust not be thrown away, and they eat it. Is this the way to dispose\nof poor bread? Will you put it into the stomach to be converted into\n642 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nblood? Has the stomach power to make sour bread sweet? heavy\nbread light? moldy bread fresh?\nMothers neglect this branch in the education of their daughters.\nThey take the burden of care and labor, and are fast wearing out,\nwhile the daughter is excused, to visit, to crochet, or study her own [683]\npleasure. This is mistaken love, mistaken kindness. The mother is\ndoing an injury to her child, which frequently lasts her lifetime. At\nthe age when she should be capable of bearing some of life\u2019s burdens,\nshe is unqualified to do so. Such will not take care and burdens.\nThey go light-loaded, excusing themselves from responsibilities,\nwhile the mother is pressed down under her burden of care, as a\ncart beneath sheaves. The daughter does not mean to be unkind; but\nshe is careless and heedless, or she would notice the tired look and\nmark the expression of pain upon the countenance of the mother, and\nwould seek to do her part to bear the heavier part of the burden and\nrelieve the mother, who must have freedom from care or be brought\nupon a bed of suffering and, it may be, of death.\nWhy will mothers be so blind and negligent in the education of\ntheir daughters? I have been distressed, as I have visited different\nfamilies, to see the mother bearing the heavy burden, while the\ndaughter, who manifested buoyancy of spirit and had a good degree\nof health and vigor, felt no care, no burden. When there are large\ngatherings, and families are burdened with company, I have seen\nthe mother bearing the burden, with the care of everything upon her,\nwhile the daughters are sitting down chatting with young friends,\nhaving a social visit. These things seem so wrong to me that I can\nhardly forbear speaking to the thoughtless youth and telling them\nto go to work. Release your tired mother. Lead her to a seat in the\nparlor and urge her to rest and enjoy the society of her friends.\nBut the daughters are not the ones to be blamed wholly in this\nmatter. The mother is at fault. She has not patiently taught her\ndaughters how to cook. She knows that they lack knowledge in\nthe cooking department, and therefore feels no release from the\nlabor. She must attend to everything that requires care, thought, and\nattention. Young ladies should be thoroughly instructed in cooking.\nWhatever be their circumstances in life, here is knowledge which[684]\nmay be put to a practical use. It is a branch of education which has\nthe most direct influence upon human life, especially the lives of\nHealthful Cookery 643\nthose held most dear. Many a wife and mother who has not had the\nright education and lacks skill in the cooking department is daily\npresenting her family with ill-prepared food which is steadily and\nsurely destroying the digestive organs, making a poor quality of\nblood, and frequently bringing on acute attacks of inflammatory\ndisease and causing premature death. Many have been brought to\ntheir death by eating heavy, sour bread. An instance was related\nto me of a hired girl who made a batch of sour, heavy bread. In\norder to get rid of it and conceal the matter, she threw it to a couple\nof very large hogs. Next morning the man of the house found his\nswine dead, and, upon examining the trough, found pieces of this\nheavy bread. He made inquiries, and the girl acknowledged what\nshe had done. She had not a thought of the effect of such bread upon\nthe swine. If heavy, sour bread will kill swine, which can devour\nrattlesnakes and almost every detestable thing, what effect will it\nhave upon that tender organ, the human stomach?\nIt is a religious duty for every Christian girl and woman to learn\nat once to make good, sweet, light bread from unbolted wheat flour.\nMothers should take their daughters into the kitchen with them when\nvery young and teach them the art of cooking. The mother cannot\nexpect her daughters to understand the mysteries of housekeeping\nwithout education. She should instruct them patiently, lovingly, and\nmake the work as agreeable as she can by her cheerful countenance\nand encouraging words of approval. If they fail once, twice, or\nthrice, censure not. Already discouragement is doing its work and\ntempting them to say: \u201cIt is of no use; I can\u2019t do it.\u201d This is not\nthe time for censure. The will is becoming weakened. It needs the\nspur of encouraging, cheerful, hopeful words, as: \u201cNever mind the [685]\nmistakes you have made. You are but a learner and must expect to\nmake blunders. Try again. Put your mind on what you are doing. Be\nvery careful, and you will certainly succeed.\u201d\nMany mothers do not realize the importance of this branch of\nknowledge, and rather than have the trouble and care of instruct-\ning their children and bearing with their failings and errors while\nlearning, they prefer to do all themselves. And when their daughters\nmake a failure in their efforts, they send them away with: \u201cIt is no\nuse; you can\u2019t do this or that. You perplex and trouble me more than\nyou help me.\u201d\n644 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nThus the first efforts of the learners are repulsed, and the first\nfailure so cools their interest and ardor to learn that they dread an-\nother trial, and will propose to sew, knit, clean house\u2014anything but\ncook. Here the mother was greatly at fault. She should have patiently\ninstructed them that they might by practice obtain an experience\nwhich would remove the awkwardness and remedy the unskillful\nmovements of the inexperienced worker. Here I will add extracts\nfrom Testimony, No. 10, page 392, published in 1864:\n\u201cChildren who have been petted and waited upon, always expect\nit; and if their expectations are not met, they are disappointed and\ndiscouraged. This same disposition will be seen through their whole\nlives; they will be helpless, leaning upon others for aid, expecting\nothers to favor them and yield to them. And if they are opposed,\neven after they have grown to manhood and womanhood, they think\nthemselves abused; and thus they worry their way through the world,\nhardly able to bear their own weight, often murmuring and fretting\nbecause everything does not suit them.\n\u201cMistaken parents are teaching their children lessons which will\nprove ruinous to them, and are also planting thorns for their own\nfeet. They think that by gratifying the wishes of their children, and\nletting them follow their own inclinations, they can gain their love.[686]\nWhat an error! Children thus indulged grow up unrestrained in\ntheir desires, unyielding in their dispositions, selfish, exacting, and\noverbearing, a curse to themselves and to all around them. To a\ngreat extent, parents hold in their own hands the future happiness of\ntheir children. Upon them rests the important work of forming the\ncharacter of these children. The instructions given in childhood will\nfollow them all through life. Parents sow the seed which will spring\nup and bear fruit either for good or evil. They can fit their sons and\ndaughters for happiness or for misery.\n\u201cChildren should be taught very young to be useful, to help\nthemselves, and to help others. Many daughters of this age can,\nwithout remorse of conscience, see their mothers toiling, cooking,\nwashing, or ironing, while they sit in the parlor and read stories,\nknit edging, crochet, or embroider. Their hearts are as unfeeling as\na stone. But where does this wrong originate? Who are the ones\nusually most to blame in this matter? The poor, deceived parents.\nThey overlook the future good of their children, and in their mistaken\nHealthful Cookery 645\nfondness, let them sit in idleness, or do that which is of but little\naccount, which requires no exercise of the mind or muscles, and\nthen excuse their indolent daughters because they are weakly. What\nhas made them weakly? In many cases it has been the wrong course\nof the parents. A proper amount of exercise about the house would\nimprove both mind and body. But children are deprived of this\nthrough false ideas, until they are averse to work. It is disagreeable\nand does not accord with their ideas of gentility. It is thought to be\nunladylike and even coarse to wash dishes, iron, or stand over the\nwashtub. This is the fashionable instruction which is given children\nin this unfortunate age.\n\u201cGod\u2019s people should be governed by higher principles than\nworldlings, who seek to gauge all their course of action according\nto fashion. God-fearing parents should train their children for a life [687]\nof usefulness.... Prepare them to bear burdens while young. If your\nchildren have been unaccustomed to labor, they will soon become\nweary. They will complain of side ache, pain in the shoulders, and\ntired limbs; and you will be in danger, through sympathy, of doing\nthe work yourselves, rather than have them suffer a little. Let the\nburden upon the children be very light at first, and then increase it a\nlittle every day, until they can do a proper amount of labor without\nbecoming so weary. Inactivity is the greatest cause of side ache and\nshoulder ache among children....\n\u201cMothers should take their daughters with them into the kitchen\nand patiently educate them. Their constitution will be better for such\nlabor, their muscles will gain tone and strength, and their meditations\nwill be more healthy and elevated at the close of the day. They may\nbe weary, but how sweet is rest after a proper amount of labor. Sleep,\nnature\u2019s sweet restorer, invigorates the weary body, and prepares it\nfor the next day\u2019s duties. Do not intimate to your children that it\nis no matter whether they labor or not. Teach them that their help\nis needed, that their time is of value, and that you depend on their\nlabor.\u201d\n* * * * *\nChapter 116\u2014Books and Tracts\nThe proper circulation and distribution of our publications is one\nof the most important branches of the present work. But little can\nbe done without this. And our ministers can do more in this work\nthan any other class of persons. It is true that a few years ago many\nof our preachers were carrying the matter of the sale of books too\nfar. Some of them added to the stock which they held for sale, not\nonly publications of little real value, but also articles of merchandise\nequally valueless.\nBut some of our ministers now take an extreme view of what[688]\nI said in Testimony No. 11 upon the sale of our publications. One\nin the State of New York, upon whom the burdens of labor do not\nrest heavily, who had acted as agent, holding a good assortment of\npublications, decided to sell no more, and wrote to the office, stating\nthat the publications were subject to their order. This is wrong. Here\nI will give an extract from Testimony No. 11, page 472:\n\u201cThe burden of selling our publications should not rest upon\nministers who labor in word and doctrine. Their time and strength\nshould be held in reserve, that their efforts may be thorough in a\nseries of meetings. Their time and strength should not be drawn\nupon to sell our books when they can be properly brought before\nthe public by those who have not the burden of preaching the word.\nIn entering new fields it may be necessary for the minister to take\npublications with him to offer for sale to the people, and it may\nbe necessary in some other circumstances also to sell books and\ntransact business for the office of publication. But such work should\nbe avoided whenever it can be done by others.\u201d\nThe first portion of this extract is qualified by the last part. To be\na little more definite, my views of this matter are, that such ministers\nas Elders Andrews, Waggoner, White, and Loughborough, who have\nthe oversight of the work, and consequently have an extra amount\nof care, burden, and labor, should not add to their burdens by the\nsale of our publications, especially at tent meetings and at General\n646\nBooks and Tracts 647\nConferences. The view was given to correct those who at such\nmeetings so far came down from the dignity of their work as to\nspread out before the crowd merchandise which had no connection\nwith the work.\nOur ministers who enjoy a comfortable state of health may, with\nthe greatest propriety, engage at proper times in the sale of our\nimportant publications. Especially do the sale and circulation of\nsuch works as have recently been urged upon the attention of our [689]\npeople, claim vigorous efforts for them at this time. In four weeks,\non our tour in the counties of Gratiot, Saginaw, and Tuscola, my\nhusband sold, and gave to the poor, four hundred dollars\u2019 worth. He\nfirst set the importance of the books before the people; then they\nwere ready to take them as fast as he, with several to help him, could\nwait upon them.\nWhy do not our brethren send in their pledges on the book and\ntract fund more liberally? And why do not our ministers take hold\nof this work in earnest? Our people should see that these works are\njust what is needed to help those who need help. Here is a chance\nto invest means according to the blessed plan of liberality. We can\nsometimes read men nearly as plainly as we read books. There are\nthose among us who put from one hundred to one thousand dollars\nor more into the Health Institute, who have pledged only from five\nto twenty-five dollars in the great enterprise of publishing books,\npamphlets, and tracts, setting forth truths which have to do with\neternal life. One was supposed to be a paying investment. The other,\nas we might judge from the littleness of the pledges, is supposed to\nbe a dead loss.\nWe shall not hold our peace upon this subject. Our people will\ncome up to the work. The means will come. And we would say to\nthose who are poor and want books: Send in your orders, with a\nstatement of your condition as to this world\u2019s goods. We will send\nyou a package of books containing four volumes of Spiritual Gifts,\nHow to Live, Appeal to Youth, Appeal to Mothers, Sabbath Readings,\nand the two large charts, with Key of Explanation. If you have a part\nof these, state what you have, and we will send other books in their\nplaces, or send only such of these as you have not. Send fifty cents\nto pay the postage, and we will send you the five-dollar package and\ncharge the fund four dollars. [See Appendix.]\n648 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nIn this charitable book matter, all must act upon the great plan\nof liberality, such as is carried out in the publication and sale of the[690]\nAmerican Bibles and tracts. In many respects the course of these\nmammoth societies is worthy of imitation. Liberality is seen in wills\nand donations, and it is carried out in sales and donations of Bibles\nand tracts. Seventh-day Adventists should be as far ahead of these\nin the book matter as in other things. May God help us. Our tracts\nshould be offered by the hundred at what they cost, leaving a little\nmargin to pay for packing, or wrapping for the mail, and directing.\nAnd ministers and people should engage in the circulation of books,\npamphlets, and tracts, as never before. Sell where people are able\nand willing to purchase, and where they are not, give them the books.\n* * * * *\nChapter 117\u2014The Christian\u2019s Watchword\nDear Brother B,\nI was shown that you move much from feeling instead of from\nfirm principle. You lack a deep and thorough experience in the things\nof God. You need to be wholly converted to the truth. When a man\u2019s\nheart is fully converted, all that he possesses is consecrated to the\nLord. This consecration you have not yet experienced. You love\nthe truth in word, but do not manifest that love in your deeds and\nby your fruits. Your acts, your deeds, are evidences of the sincerity\nof your love, or of your indifference to God, His cause, and your\nfellow men.\nHow did Christ manifest His love for poor mortals? By the\nsacrifice of His own glory, His own riches, and even His most\nprecious life. Christ consented to a life of humiliation and great\nsuffering. He submitted to the cruel mockings of an infuriated,\nmurderous multitude, and to the most agonizing death upon the\ncross. Said Christ: \u201cThis is My commandment, That ye love one\nanother, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no man than this,\nthat a man lay down his life for his friends. Ye are My friends, if [691]\nye do whatsoever I command you.\u201d We give evidence of being the\nfriends of Christ when we manifest implicit obedience to His will.\nIt is no evidence to say, and do not; but in doing, in obeying, is the\nevidence. Who are obeying the commandment to love one another\nas Christ has loved them? Brother B, you must have a firmer, deeper,\nand more unselfish love than you have ever yet possessed, if you\nobey the commandment of Christ.\nYou lack benevolence. You labor to save yourself from care,\ntrouble, or expense for the cause of God. You have invested but little\nin the cause. The enterprise which man values the most will be seen\nby his investments. If he places a higher estimate upon eternal things\nthan upon temporal things, he will show this by his works; he will\ninvest the most, and venture the most, in that which he values the\nhighest and which in the end brings him the greatest profit.\n649\n650 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nMen who profess the truth will engage in worldly enterprises, and\ninvest much, and run great risks. If they lose nearly all they possess,\nthey are deeply aggrieved, because they feel the inconvenience of\nthe losses they have sustained; yet they do not feel that their unwise\ncourse has deprived the cause of God of means, and that as His\nstewards they must render an account for this squandering of the\nLord\u2019s money. Should they be required to venture something for the\ncause of God, to invest a quarter even of that which they have lost\nby their investment in earthly things, they would feel that heaven\ncosts too much.\nEternal things are not appreciated. You are not a rich man, yet\nyour heart may be just as much placed upon the little you have,\nand you may cling to it just as closely as the millionaire to his\ntreasures. Small, very small, will be the profits realized by you in\nyour investments in worldly enterprises; while, on the other hand,\nif you invest in the cause of God, make that cause a part of you,\nand love it as you love yourself, and are willing to sacrifice for[692]\nits advancement, showing your confidence and faith in its ultimate\ntriumph, you will reap a precious harvest, if not in this life, in the\nbetter life than this. You will reap an eternal reward which is of as\nmuch higher value than any common, earthly gains as the immortal\nis higher than the perishable.\nBrother B, you seemed anxious to find out what had been said\nin regard to your position in the church and what was our mind in\nregard to it. It was just this that I have written. I feared for you\nbecause of what I have been shown of your peculiarities. You moved\nby impulse. You would pray if you felt like it, and speak if you felt\nlike it. You would go to meeting if so disposed, or stay at home\nif not. You greatly lacked the spirit of self-sacrifice. You have\nconsulted your own wishes and ease, and pleased yourself, instead\nof feeling that you should please God. Duty, duty! at your post\nevery time. Have you enlisted as a soldier of the cross of Christ?\nIf so, your feelings do not excuse you from duty. You must be\nwilling to endure hardness as a good soldier. Go without the camp,\nbearing the reproach; for thus did the Captain of your salvation.\nThe qualifications of a bishop, or of an elder or deacon, are, to be\n\u201cblameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not soon angry,\nnot given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of\nChristian\u2019s Watchword 651\nhospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; holding\nfast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by\nsound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.\u201d\nPaul enumerates the precious gifts to be desired, and exhorts the\nbrethren: \u201cHe that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth,\nwith diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be\nwithout dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which\nis good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love;\nin honor preferring one another; not slothful in business; fervent\nin spirit; serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; [693]\ncontinuing instant in prayer; distributing to the necessity of saints;\ngiven to hospitality.\u201d \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world, that\nthey be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the\nliving God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do\ngood, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to\ncommunicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation\nagainst the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d\nHere is a wise and perfectly safe investment; good works are here\nspecified and recommended for our practice, for your practice. Here\nare profits that are valuable. There will be no danger of a failure\nhere. A treasure may be secured in heaven, a constant accumulation\nwhich will give to the investor a title to eternal life. And when his\nlife here shall close, and probation end, he may lay hold on eternal\nlife.\nBrother B, you are not a lover of hospitality, you shun burdens.\nYou feel that it is a task to feed the saints and look after their wants,\nand that all you do in this direction is lost. Please read the above\nscriptures, and may God give you understanding and discernment, is\nmy earnest prayer. As a family you need to cultivate liberality and to\nbe less self-caring. Love to invite God\u2019s people to your house, and,\nas occasion may require, share with them cheerfully, gladly, that of\nwhich the Lord has made you stewards. Do not give grudgingly these\nlittle favors. As you do these things to Christ\u2019s disciples, you do it\nunto Him; just so, as you grudge the saints of God your hospitality,\nyou grudge Jesus the same.\nThe health reform is essential for you both. Sister B has been\nbackward in this good work and has suffered opposition to arise\nwhen she knew not what she was opposing. She has resisted the\n652 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\ncounsel of God against her own soul. Intemperate appetite has\nbrought debility and disease, weakening the moral powers, and un-\nfitting her to appreciate the sacred truth, the value of the atonement,[694]\nwhich is essential to salvation. Sister B loves this world. She has not\nseparated, in her affections, from the world, and given herself unre-\nservedly to God, as He requires. He will not accept half a sacrifice.\nAll, all, all, is God\u2019s, and we are required to render perfect service.\nSays Paul: \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of\nGod, that ye present your bodies a living [not dying] sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not\nconformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing\nof your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,\nand perfect, will of God.\u201d What a privilege is thus allowed us, to\nprove for ourselves, experimentally, the mind of the Lord and His\nwill toward us. Praise His dear name for this precious gift! I have\nbeen shown that Sister B\u2019s grasp must be broken from this world\nbefore she can have a true, safe hold of the better world.\nBrother B, you should move carefully and keep self under; be\npatient, meek, and lowly. A meek and quiet spirit is in the sight of\nGod of great price. You should cherish that which God esteems of\nworth. A work must be accomplished for you both before you can\nmeet the measurement of God. Work while the day lasts, for the\nnight cometh in which no man can work. Stand in the clear light\nyourselves, then can you let your light so shine that others by seeing\nyour good works will be led to glorify your heavenly Father.\nGreenville, Michigan,\nJanuary 23, 1868.\n* * * * *\nChapter 118\u2014Sympathy at Home\nDear Brother and Sister C,\nYour cases have been brought before me in vision. As I viewed\nyour lives, they appeared to be a terrible mistake. Brother C, you\nhave not a happy temperament. And not being happy yourself,\nyou fail to make others happy. You have not cultivated affection, [695]\ntenderness, and love. Your wife has suffered all through her married\nlife for sympathy. Your married life has been very much like a\ndesert\u2014but very few green spots to look back upon with grateful\nremembrance. It need not have been thus.\nLove can no more exist without revealing itself in outward acts\nthan fire can be kept alive without fuel. You, Brother C, have felt that\nit was beneath your dignity to manifest tenderness by kindly acts,\nand to watch for an opportunity to evince affection for your wife by\nwords of tenderness and kind regard. You are changeable in your\nfeelings, and are very much affected by surrounding circumstances.\nYou have not felt that it was wrong, displeasing to God, to allow\nyour mind to be fully engrossed with the world, and then bring your\nworldly perplexities into your family, thus letting the adversary into\nyour home. It is very easy for you thus to open the door, but you\nwill find it not so easy to close; it will be very difficult to turn out\nthe enemy when once you have brought him in. Leave your business\ncares and perplexities and annoyances when you leave your business.\nCome to your family with a cheerful countenance, with sympathy,\ntenderness, and love. This will be better than expending money\nfor medicines or physicians for your wife. It will be health to the\nbody and strength to the soul. Your lives have been very wretched.\nYou have both acted a part in making them so. God is not pleased\nwith your misery; you have brought it upon yourselves by want of\nself-control.\nYou let feelings bear sway. You think it beneath your dignity,\nBrother C, to manifest love, to speak kindly and affectionately. All\nthese tender words, you think, savor of softness and weakness, and\n653\n654 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nare unnecessary. But in their place come fretful words, words of\ndiscord, strife, and censure. Do you account these as manly and\nnoble? as an exhibition of the sterner virtues of your sex? However\nyou may consider them, God looks upon them with displeasure and[696]\nmarks them in His book. Angels flee from the dwelling where words\nof discord are exchanged, where gratitude is almost a stranger to\nthe heart, and censure leaps like black balls to the lips, spotting the\ngarments, defiling the Christian character.\nWhen you married your wife, she loved you. She was extremely\nsensitive, yet with painstaking on your part, and fortitude on hers, her\nhealth need not have been what it is. But your stern coldness made\nyou like an iceberg, freezing up the channel of love and affection.\nYour censure and faultfinding has been like desolating hail to a\nsensitive plant. It has chilled and nearly destroyed the life of the\nplant. Your love of the world is eating out the good traits of your\ncharacter. Your wife is of a different turn and more generous. But\nwhen she has, even in small matters, exercised her generous instincts,\nyou have felt a drawback in your feelings and have censured her. You\nindulge a close and grudging spirit. You make your wife feel that she\nis a tax, a burden, and that she has no right to exercise her generosity\nat your expense. All these things are of such a discouraging nature\nthat she feels hopeless and helpless, and has not stamina to bear up\nagainst it, but bends to the force of the blast. Her disease is pain of\nthe nerves. Were her married life agreeable, she would possess a\ngood degree of health. But all through your married life the demon\nhas been a guest in your family to exult over your misery.\nDisappointed hopes have made you both completely wretched.\nYou will have no reward for your suffering, for you have caused\nit yourselves. Your own words have been like deadly poison upon\nnerve and brain, upon bone and muscle. You reap that which you\nsow. You do not appreciate the feelings and sufferings of each other.\nGod is displeased with the hard, unfeeling, world-loving spirit you\npossess. Brother C, the love of money is the root of all evil. You\nhave loved money, loved the world; you have looked at the illness of[697]\nyour wife as a severe, a terrible, tax, not realizing that it is your fault\nin a great measure that she is sick. You have not the elements of a\ncontented spirit. You dwell upon your troubles; imaginary want and\npoverty far ahead stare you in the face; you feel afflicted, distressed,\nSympathy at Home 655\nagonized; your brain seems on fire, your spirits depressed. You do\nnot cherish love to God and gratitude of heart for all the blessings\nwhich your kind heavenly Father has bestowed upon you. You see\nonly the discomforts of life. A worldly insanity shuts you in like\nheavy clouds of thick darkness. Satan exults over you because you\nwill have misery when peace and happiness are at your command.\nYou listen to a discourse; the truth affects you, and the nobler\npowers of your mind arouse to control your actions. You see how\nlittle you have sacrificed for God, how closely self has been cher-\nished, and you are swayed to the right by the influence of the truth;\nbut when you pass from under this sacred, sanctifying, soothing\ninfluence, you do not possess it in your own heart, and you soon\nfall into the same barren, ungenial state of feeling. Work, work,\nyou must work; brain, bone, and muscle are taxed to the utmost to\nget means which your imagination tells you must be obtained, or\nwant and starvation will be your lot. This is a delusion of Satan,\none of his wily snares to lead you to perdition. \u201cSufficient unto the\nday is the evil thereof.\u201d But you make for yourself a time of trouble\nbeforehand.\nYou have not faith and love and confidence in God. If you had,\nyou would trust in Him. You worry yourself out of the arms of\nChrist, fearing that He will not care for you. Health is sacrificed.\nGod is not glorified in your body and spirit, which are His. There is\nnot a sweet, cheering home influence to soothe and counteract the\nevil which is predominant in your nature. The high, noble powers\nof your mind are overpowered by the lower organs; the evil traits of\nyour character are developed.\nYou are selfish, exacting, and overbearing. This ought not to [698]\nbe. Your salvation depends on your acting from principle\u2014serving\nGod from principle, not from feeling, not from impulse. God will\nhelp you when you feel your need of help and set about the work\nwith resolution, trusting in Him with all your heart. You are often\ndiscouraged without sufficient reason. You indulge feelings akin to\nhatred. Your likes and dislikes are strong. These you must restrain.\nControl the tongue. \u201cIf any man offend not in word, the same is a\nperfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.\u201d Help has been\nlaid upon One that is mighty. He will be your strength and support,\nyour front guard and rearward.\n656 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nWhat preparation are you making for the better life? It is Satan\nwho makes you think that all your powers must be exercised to get\nalong in this world. You are fearing and trembling for the future of\nthis life, while you are neglecting the future, eternal life. Where is\nthe anxiety, the earnestness, the zeal, lest you make a failure there\nand sustain an immense loss? To lose a little of this world seems to\nyou a terrible calamity which would cost your life. But the thought\nof losing heaven does not cause half the fears to be manifested.\nThrough your careful efforts to save this life, you are in danger of\nlosing eternal life. You cannot afford to lose heaven, lose eternal\nlife, lose the eternal weight of glory. You cannot afford to lose all\nthese riches, this exceedingly precious, immeasurable happiness.\nWhy do you not act like a sane man, and be as earnest, as zealous,\nand as persevering in your efforts for the better life, the immortal\ncrown, the eternal, imperishable treasure, as you are for this poor,\nmiserable life and these poor perishable, earthly treasures?\nYour heart is on your earthly treasures, therefore you have no\nheart for the heavenly. These poor things which are seen\u2014the\nearthly\u2014eclipse the glory of the heavenly. Where your treasure is,\nthere will your heart be also. Your words will declare, your acts[699]\nwill show, where your treasure is. If it is in this world, the little\ngain of earth, your anxieties will be manifested in that direction. If\nyou are striving for the immortal inheritance with an earnestness,\nenergy, and zeal proportionate to its value, then can you be a fair\ncandidate for everlasting life, and heir of glory. You need a fresh\nconversion every day. Die daily to self, keep your tongue as with a\nbridle, control your words, cease your murmurings and complaints,\nlet not one word of censure escape your lips. If this requires a great\neffort, make it; you will be repaid in so doing.\nYour life is now miserable, full of evil forebodings. Gloomy\npictures loom up before you; dark unbelief has enclosed you. By\ntalking on the side of unbelief you have grown darker and darker;\nyou take satisfaction in dwelling upon unpleasant themes. If others\ntry to talk hopefully, you crush out in them every hopeful feeling by\ntalking all the more earnestly and severely. Your trials and afflictions\nare ever keeping before your wife the soul-harrowing thought that\nyou consider her a burden because of her illness. If you love darkness\nand despair, talk of them, dwell upon them, and harrow up your soul\nSympathy at Home 657\nby conjuring up in your imagination everything you can to cause\nyou to murmur against your family and against God, and make your\nown heart like a field which the fire has passed over, destroying all\nverdure, and leaving it dry, blackened, and crisped.\nYou have a diseased imagination and deserve pity. Yet no one\ncan help you as well as yourself. If you want faith, talk faith; talk\nhopefully, cheerfully. May God help you to see the sinfulness of\nyour course. You need help in this matter, the help of your daughter\nand your wife. If you suffer Satan to control your thoughts as you\nhave done, you will become a special subject for him to use and\nwill ruin your own soul and the happiness of your family. What a\nterrible influence has your daughter had! The mother, not receiving\nlove and sympathy from you, has centered her affections upon the [700]\ndaughter and has idolized her. She has been a petted, indulged, and\nnearly spoiled child through the exercise of injudicious affection.\nHer education has been sadly neglected. Had she been instructed in\nhousehold duties, taught to bear her share of the family burdens, she\nwould now be more healthy and happy. It is the duty of every mother\nto teach her children to act their part in life, to share her burdens,\nand not be useless machines.\nYour daughter\u2019s health would have been better had she been\neducated to physical labor. Her muscles and nerves are weak, lax,\nand feeble. How can they be otherwise when they have so little use?\nThis child has but little power of endurance. A small amount of\nphysical exercise wearies her and endangers health. There is not\nelasticity in muscles and nerves. Her physical powers have so long\nlain dormant that her life is nearly useless. Mistaken mother! know\nyou not that in giving your daughter so many privileges of learning\nthe sciences, and not educating her to usefulness and household\nlabor, you do her a great injury? This exercise would have hardened,\nor confirmed, her constitution and improved her health. Instead of\nthis tenderness proving a blessing, it will prove a terrible curse. Had\nthe family burdens been shared with the daughter, the mother would\nnot have overdone, and might have saved herself much suffering and\nbenefited the daughter all the time. She should not now commence\nto labor all at once and bear the burdens which one at her age could\nbear, but she can educate herself to perform physical labor to a much\ngreater extent than she has ever done in her life.\n658 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nSister C has a diseased imagination. She has secluded herself\nfrom the air until she cannot endure it without inconvenience. The\nheat of her room is very injurious to health. Her circulation is\ndepressed. She has lived in the hot air so much that she cannot[701]\nendure the exposure of a ride out of doors without realizing a change.\nHer poor health is owing somewhat to the exclusion of air, and she\nhas become so tender that she cannot have air without making her\nsick. If she continues to indulge this diseased imagination, she\nwill be able to bear scarcely a breath of air. She ought to have the\nwindows lowered in her room all through the day, that there may be\na circulation of air. God is not pleased with her for thus murdering\nherself. It is unnecessary. She has become thus sensitive through\nindulging a diseased mind. Air she needs, air she must have. She\nis destroying not only her own vitality, but that of her husband and\ndaughter, and of all who visit her. The air in her room is decidedly\nimpure and dead; none can have health who accustom themselves to\nsuch an atmosphere. She has petted herself in this matter until she\ncannot visit the houses of her brethren without taking cold. For her\nown sake and for the sake of those around her, she must change this;\nshe should accustom herself to the air, increasing it a little every\nday, until she can breathe the pure, vitalizing air without injury. The\nsurface of the skin is nearly dead, because it has no air to breathe.\nIts million little mouths are closed, because they are clogged by the\nimpurities of the system, and for want of air. It would be presumption\nto let in a free draft of air at once from out of doors, all through the\nday. Let it in by degrees; change gradually. In a week she can have\nthe windows down two or three inches day and night.\nLungs and liver are diseased because she deprives herself of\nvital air. Air is the free blessing of heaven, calculated to electrify\nthe whole system. Without it the system will be filled with disease\nand become dormant, languid, feeble. Yet you have all been for\nyears living with a very limited amount of air. In thus doing, your\nwife drags others into the same poisonous atmosphere with herself.\nNone of you can possess clear, unclouded brains while breathing a[702]\npoisonous atmosphere. Sister C dreads to stir out to go anywhere\nbecause she must feel the change in the atmosphere and take cold.\nShe can yet be brought into a much better condition of health if she\nrightly treats herself. Twice a week she should take a general bath,\nSympathy at Home 659\nas cool as will be agreeable, a little cooler every time, until the skin\nis toned up.\nShe need not linger along as she does, always sick, if you will\nall as a family heed the instructions given of the Lord. \u201cHe that will\nlove life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and\nhis lips that they speak no guile: let him eschew evil, and do good;\nlet him seek peace, and ensue it. For the eyes of the Lord are over the\nrighteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of\nthe Lord is against them that do evil.\u201d A contented mind, a cheerful\nspirit, is health to the body and strength to the soul. Nothing is so\nfruitful a cause of disease as depression, gloominess, and sadness.\nMental depression is terrible. You all suffer from it. The daughter\nis fretful, partaking of the spirit of the father; and then the heated,\noppressed atmosphere, deprived of vitality, benumbs the sensitive\nbrain. The lungs contract, the liver is inactive.\nAir, air, the precious boon of heaven which all may have, will\nbless you with its invigorating influence if you will not refuse it\nentrance. Welcome it, cultivate a love for it, and it will prove a\nprecious soother of the nerves. Air must be in constant circulation\nto be kept pure. The influence of pure, fresh air is to cause the blood\nto circulate healthfully through the system. It refreshes the body\nand tends to render it strong and healthy, while at the same time\nits influence is decidedly felt upon the mind, imparting a degree\nof composure and serenity. It excites the appetite, and renders the\ndigestion of food more perfect, and induces sound and sweet sleep.\nThe effects produced by living in close, ill-ventilated rooms are\nthese: The system becomes weak and unhealthy, the circulation is [703]\ndepressed, the blood moves sluggishly through the system because\nit is not purified and vitalized by the pure, invigorating air of heaven.\nThe mind becomes depressed and gloomy, while the whole system\nis enervated; and fevers and other acute diseases are liable to be\ngenerated. Your careful exclusion of external air and fear of free\nventilation leave you to breathe the corrupt, unwholesome air which\nis exhaled from the lungs of those staying in these rooms, and which\nis poisonous, unfit for the support of life. The body becomes relaxed,\nthe skin becomes sallow, digestion is retarded, and the system is\npeculiarly sensitive to the influence of cold. A slight exposure\nproduces serious diseases. Great care should be exercised not to sit\n660 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nin a draft or in a cold room when weary, or when in a perspiration.\nYou should so accustom yourself to the air that you will not be under\nthe necessity of having the mercury higher than sixty-five degrees.\nYou can be a happy family if you will do what God has given\nyou to do and has enjoined upon you as a duty. But the Lord will not\ndo for you that which He has left for you to do. Brother C deserves\npity. He has so long felt unhappy that life has become a burden\nto him. It need not be thus. His imagination is diseased, and he\nhas so long kept his eyes on the dark picture that if he meets with\nadversity or disappointment, he imagines that everything is going\nto ruin, that he will come to want, that everything is against him,\nthat he has the hardest time of anyone; and thus his life is made\nwretched. The more he thinks thus, the more miserable he makes\nhis life and the lives of all around him. He has no reason to feel as\nhe does; it is all the work of Satan. He must not suffer the enemy\nthus to control his mind. He should turn away from the dark and\ngloomy picture to that of the loving Saviour, the glory of heaven, and\nthe rich inheritance prepared for all who are humble and obedient,\nand who possess grateful hearts and abiding faith in the promises of\nGod. This will cost him an effort, a struggle; but it must be done.\nYour present happiness and your future, eternal happiness depend[704]\nupon your fixing your mind upon cheerful things, looking away from\nthe dark picture, which is imaginary, to the benefits which God has\nstrewn in your pathway, and beyond these, to the unseen and eternal.\nYou belong to a family who possess minds not well balanced,\ngloomy and depressed, affected by surroundings, and susceptible to\ninfluences. Unless you cultivate a cheerful, happy, grateful frame\nof mind, Satan will eventually lead you captive at his will. You can\nbe a help, a strength to the church where you reside, if you will\nobey the instructions of the Lord and not move by feeling, but be\ncontrolled by principle. Never allow censure to escape your lips, for\nit is like desolating hail to those around you. Let cheerful, happy,\nloving words fall from your lips.\nBrother C, your organism is not the best for your spiritual ad-\nvancement, yet the grace of God can do much to correct the defects\nin your character and strengthen and more perfectly develop those\npowers of mind which are now weak and need force. In so doing you\nwill bring into control those lower qualities which have overpowered\nSympathy at Home 661\nthe higher. You are like a man whose sensibilities are benumbed.\nYou need to have the truth take hold of you and work a thorough\nreformation in your life. \u201cBe not conformed to this world: but be ye\ntransformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what\nis that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.\u201d This is what\nyou need, and what you must experience\u2014the transformation which\na sanctification through the truth will effect for you.\nDo you believe that the end of all things is at hand, that the\nscenes of this earth\u2019s history are fast closing? If so, show your faith\nby your works. A man will show all the faith he has. Some think\nthey have a good degree of faith, when if they have any, it is dead,\nfor it is not sustained by works. \u201cFaith if it hath not works, is dead, [705]\nbeing alone.\u201d Few have that genuine faith which works by love and\npurifies the soul. But all who are accounted worthy of everlasting\nlife must obtain a moral fitness for the same. \u201cBeloved, now are we\nthe sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but\nwe know that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we\nshall see Him as He is. And every man that hath this hope in Him\npurifieth himself, even as He is pure.\u201d This is the work before you,\nand you have none too much time if you engage in the work with all\nyour soul.\nYou must experience a death to self, and must live unto God.\n\u201cIf ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,\nwhere Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.\u201d Self is not to be\nconsulted. Pride, self-love, selfishness, avarice, covetousness, love\nof the world, hatred, suspicion, jealousy, evil surmisings, must all be\nsubdued and sacrificed forever. When Christ shall appear, it will not\nbe to correct these evils and then give a moral fitness for His coming.\nThis preparation must all be made before He comes. It should be a\nsubject of thought, of study, and earnest inquiry, What shall we do\nto be saved? What shall be our conduct that we may show ourselves\napproved unto God?\nWhen tempted to murmur, censure, and indulge in fretfulness,\nwounding those around you, and in so doing wounding your own\nsoul, oh! let the deep, earnest, anxious inquiry come from your\nsoul, Shall I stand without fault before the throne of God? Only\nthe faultless will be there. None will be translated to heaven while\ntheir hearts are filled with the rubbish of earth. Every defect in the\n662 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmoral character must first be remedied, every stain removed by the\ncleansing blood of Christ, and all the unlovely, unlovable traits of\ncharacter overcome.\nHow long a time are you designing to take to prepare to be intro-[706]\nduced into the society of heavenly angels in glory? In the state which\nyou and your family are in at present, all heaven would be marred\nshould you be introduced therein. The work for you must be done\nhere. This earth is the fitting-up place. You have not one moment\nto lose. All is harmony, peace, and love in heaven. No discord,\nno strife, no censuring, no unloving words, no clouded brows, no\njars there; and no one will be introduced there who possesses any\nof these elements so destructive to peace and happiness. Study to\nbe rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate,\nlaying up for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come,\nthat you may lay hold on everlasting life.\nForever cease your murmurings in regard to this poor life, but let\nyour soul\u2019s burden be, how to secure the better life than this, a title\nto the mansions prepared for those who are true and faithful to the\nend. If you make a mistake here, everything is lost. If you devote\nyour lifetime to securing earthly treasures, and lose the heavenly,\nyou will find that you have made a terrible mistake. You cannot have\nboth worlds. \u201cWhat shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole\nworld, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange\nfor his soul?\u201d Says the inspired Paul: \u201cFor our light affliction, which\nis but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal\nweight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but\nat the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are\ntemporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.\u201d\nThese trials of life are God\u2019s workmen to remove the impurities,\ninfirmities, and roughness from our characters, and fit us for the\nsociety of pure, heavenly angels in glory. But as we pass through\nthese trials, as the fires of affliction kindle upon us, we must not\nkeep the eye on the fire which is seen, but let the eye of faith fasten\nupon the things unseen, the eternal inheritance, the immortal life,\nthe eternal weight of glory; and while we do this the fire will not[707]\nconsume us, but only remove the dross, and we shall come forth\nseven times purified, bearing the impress of the Divine.\nSympathy at Home 663\nGreenville, Michigan,\nMarch 7, 1868\n* * * * *\nChapter 119\u2014The Husband\u2019s Position\nDear Brother and Sister D,\nWhile speaking in meeting Sunday afternoon, I could scarcely\nrefrain from calling your names and relating some things which had\nbeen shown me. I saw that Brother D did not occupy that position in\nhis family which God would have him. Sister D takes the lead; she\npossesses a strong will, which has not been subdued as God requires;\nand in order to please his wife and keep her from despondency,\nBrother D has yielded to her. Her judgment has swayed him, and he\nhas not been a free man for years.\nWhen Brother D first engaged in the work of teaching the truth,\nhe was little in his own eyes, and God used him as His instrument.\nBut I saw that for some time in the past he has not humbled himself\nunder the hand of God. He has trusted to his own wisdom and weak\njudgment, and Satan has been obtaining an advantage over him.\nInstead of relying solely upon God, and staying himself upon His\nstrength, he has had his judgment perverted by the influence of his\nwife. She has stood in a position to see, to hear, to understand, all\nthat was going on around her. Did she possess a sanctified judgment\nand heavenly wisdom, then would she see through sanctified eyes,\nand hear through sanctified ears. She would make a right use of her\neyes and ears. She has not done this. \u201cWho is blind, but My servant?\nor deaf, as My messenger that I sent?\u201d God does not wish us to hear\nall that is to be heard, or to see all that is to be seen. It is a great\nblessing to close the ears, that we hear not, and the eyes, that we see\nnot. The greatest anxiety should be to have clear eyesight to discern\nour own shortcomings, and a quick ear to catch all needed reproof[708]\nand instruction, lest by our inattention and carelessness we let them\nslip and become forgetful hearers and not doers of the work.\nBrother D, for some time in the past your labors have not been\nas wisely and successfully directed as formerly. Your course of\naction has not borne the impress of God. Your wife has managed\nyour temporal matters and borne burdens which were too heavy\n664\nHusband\u2019s Position 665\nfor her to bear, while you have been absent. This has excited your\nsympathy, and had a tendency to pervert your judgment, so that you\nhave placed too high an estimate upon her qualifications because\nof her capability in managing your temporal matters. Satan has\nbeen watching his opportunity to make as much as possible to his\nown advantage of your confidence in your wife. He has purposed\nto trammel you and destroy you both. You have to a great degree\nthrown off your stewardship upon your wife. This is wrong; she will\nhave all she can do to bear her share of the responsibility, without\nbearing that which comes upon you and for which God will hold\nyou accountable.\nSister D has been deceived in some things. She has thought that\nGod instructed her in a special sense, and you both have believed\nand acted accordingly. The discernment which she has thought she\npossessed in a special sense, is a deception of the enemy. She is\nnaturally quick to see, quick to understand, quick to anticipate, and\nis of an extremely sensitive nature. Satan has taken advantage of\nthese traits of character and has led you both astray. Brother D,\nyou have been a bondman for quite a length of time. Much of that\nwhich Sister D has thought was discernment has been jealousy. She\nhas been disposed to regard everything with a jealous eye, to be\nsuspicious, surmising evil, distrustful of almost everything. This\ncauses unhappiness of mind, despondency, and doubt, where faith\nand confidence should exist. These unhappy traits of character turn\nher thoughts into a gloomy channel, where she indulges a foreboding [709]\nof evil, while a highly sensitive temperament leads her to imagine\nneglect, slight, and injury, when it does not exist. All these things\nstand in the way of the spiritual advancement of you both, and affect\nothers to just that extent that you are connected with the cause and\nwork of God. There is a work for you to do: Humble yourselves\nunder the mighty hand of God, that you may be exalted in due time.\nThese unhappy traits of character, with a strong, set will, must be\ncorrected and reformed, or they will eventually cause you both to\nmake shipwreck of your faith.\nBrother D, you have a duty to do. Assume the stewardship you\nhave resigned, and in the fear of God take your place at the head\nof your family. You must be shaken from the influence of your\nwife, and rely more fully upon God, and look to Him to lead you\n666 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nand guide you. God has not specially instructed Sister D, or given\nher light to teach others their duty. Neither you nor your wife can\noccupy the position God would have you, while things remain as\nthey now are. You will never be established, strengthened, and\nsettled until you allow your wife to take the position a wife should.\nWhile she occupies her proper place, respect her judgment, consult\nwith her in regard to your plans, but be very cautious about taking\nit for granted that her judgment is as the judgment of God. Consult\nwith your brethren upon whom God has seen fit to lay the burden\nof the work. Had you thus advised with those whose counsel you\nshould have sought, you would not have committed so great an error,\nso sad a blunder, as you did in the case of E. God\u2019s cause was\nwounded and reproached in this case. Your wife thought she had\nlight in this case; but her impressions were not of God, but of the\nenemy, because he saw that you could be affected in this direction.\nYour trusting so completely to your wife\u2019s judgment is contrary to\nheaven\u2019s arrangement. Satan has designed in this way to cut you off,[710]\nin a great measure, from the influence of your fellow laborers and\nyour brethren in general.\nYou have had trials that you would not have had if you had not\nconsidered your wife in a position where God has not placed her.\nYou have too implicit confidence in her judgment and wisdom. She\nhas not been consecrated to God, therefore her judgment has not\nbeen consecrated. She is not a happy woman, and the unhappy\ntrain her mind has taken has greatly injured her physical and mental\nhealth. Satan has designed to unsettle you and cause your brethren\nto lose confidence in your judgment. Satan is seeking to overthrow\nyou. When God specially calls your wife to the work of teaching the\ntruth, then should you lean to her counsel and advice, and confide\nin her instructions. God may give you both, as possessing an equal\ninterest in and devotion to the work, equal qualifications to act a\nprominent part in the most solemn work of saving souls. The great\nwork before her is to be diligent in making her calling and election\nsure, to cease watching others, and now begin the work to be very\njealous of herself. She should seek to bless others by her godly\nexample, her cheerfulness, fortitude, courage, faith, hopefulness,\njoy, in that perfect trust, that confidence in God, which will be the\nresult of sanctification through the truth. An entire conformity to the\nHusband\u2019s Position 667\nwill of God she must have. Christ says to her: \u201cThou shalt love the\nLord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all\nthy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second\nis like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two\ncommandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d\nThe above was written at Mount Pleasant, Iowa, October 4, 1867.\nI could not find time to finish the testimony and copy it, so laid it by,\nand did not have time to finish it until I returned from the East to\nGreenville, Michigan, when I took it in hand, January 30, 1868.\nDear Brother and Sister D: You should have had this long ago, [711]\nbut our labors have been so hard that I could not possibly get the\ntime to write. Every place that we visited brought before my mind\nmuch that I had been shown of individual cases, and I have written\nin meeting, even while my husband was preaching.\nThe vision was given me about two years ago. The enemy\nhas hindered me in every way he could to keep souls from having\nthe light which God had given me for them. First, my husband\u2019s\ncase was so perplexing, so distressing, that I could not write. Then\nthe discouragements brought upon me by my brethren kept me in\na condition of sadness and distress, unfitting me for labor of any\ndescription. When we started to travel last summer, I commenced to\nwrite, but we have traveled from place to place so rapidly that all we\ncould do was to attend the meetings. There was much work to be\ndone. I practice rising at four o\u2019clock in the morning, to take hold\nof my writing. Yet constant, exciting labor in meeting so taxes the\nbrain that I am unprepared for writing, my head is so weary.\nI regret that you could not have had this before, but even now\nmay God make it a blessing to you, is my sincere prayer. You, my\ndear brother, may have seen these things and corrected them ere\nthis. I hope so, at least. You and also your wife have our sympathy\nand prayers. We have an interest for her as well as for yourself.\nHer soul is precious. We beseech her in Christ\u2019s stead to seek for a\nmeek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price. An\nangel pointed me to Sister D and repeated these words: \u201cWhatsoever\nthings are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things\nare just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely,\nwhatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if\nthere be any praise, think on these things.\u201d Here is the healthful train\n668 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nof thought for the mind to follow. When it would go in a different[712]\nchannel, bring it back. Control the mind. Educate it to dwell only\non those things which bring peace and love.\nI commit this to you, hoping and praying that God may bless it\nto you, and that you both may obtain a fitness to be counted worthy\nof eternal life.\nAppendix [713]\nAs an aid to an understanding of the circumstances which led\nto the giving of certain testimonies, the following notes have been\nprepared by the Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications.\nPage 116, \u201cTime to Begin the Sabbath\u201d\u2014For a period of about\nten years Sabbathkeeping Adventists observed the Sabbath from\n6 P. M. Friday to 6 P. M. Saturday. Elder Joseph Bates in his\nfirst pamphlet on the perpetuity of the Sabbath of the fourth com-\nmandment, published in 1846, had given reasons for the supposed\nscriptural support for the observance of the Sabbath in this way. He\ncited the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, the last group of\nwhich had been called at \u201cthe eleventh hour\u201d of the day and had\nwrought but one hour. The reckoning was made with them \u201cwhen\neven was Come.\u201d Matthew 20:6, 8, 12. Comparing this with Christ\u2019s\nquestion, \u201care there not twelve hours in the day?\u201d He argued that\nthe \u201ceven\u201d began with the twelfth hour, or six o\u2019clock, reckoning\nwith equatorial time or the beginning of the sacred year. Respect for\nhis years and experience and his godly life may have been the main\nreasons for accepting his conclusions without further investigation.\nAs time passed and the message spread, an increasing number\nof Sabbathkeepers questioned the practice and advocated the sunset\ntime for reckoning the beginning of the Sabbath. A thorough Bible\ninvestigation of the question was made by Elder J. N. Andrews,\nwho wrote a paper setting forth the Biblical reasons in favor of the\nsunset time. This paper was introduced and discussed on Sabbath,\nNovember 17, 1855, at the Conference in Battle Creek, Michigan,\nwith the result that nearly, but not quite, all present were convinced\nthat Elder Andrew\u2019s conclusion was correct. The presentation of the\nsubject to Mrs. White in this vision, given two days later, answered\nthe questions lingering in some minds and effected unity among the\nbelievers. Commenting on this experience, as illustrating the office\nof the visions to confirm conclusions based on Biblical study rather\nthan to introduce new teachings, Elder James White wrote later:\n669\n670 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\n\u201cThe question naturally arises, if the visions are given to correct\nthe erring, why did she not sooner see the error of the six o\u2019clock\ntime? I have ever been thankful that God corrected the error in\nHis own good time, and did not suffer an unhappy division to exist\namong us upon this point. But, dear reader, the work of the Lord\nupon this point is in perfect harmony with his manifestations to us\non others, and in harmony with the correct position upon spiritual\ngifts. It does not appear to be the desire of the Lord to teach His\npeople by the gifts of the Spirit on the Bible questions until His\nservants have diligently searched His word. When this was done\nupon the subject of the time to commence the Sabbath, and most\nwere established, and some were in danger of being out of harmony\nwith the body on this subject, then, yes, then, was the very time for[714]\nGod to magnify His goodness in the manifestation of the gift of His\nSpirit in the accomplishment of its proper work.\u201d\u2014The Review and\nHerald, February 25, 1868.\nPages 116, 117, 122, 123, \u201cThe Messenger Party\u201d\u2014In the sum-\nmer of 1854 there appeared among the Sabbathkeeping Adventists\nthe first disaffection, or apostasy. Two men who had been preach-\ning the message were reproved through the spirit of prophecy for\na harsh, censorious spirit, for avarice, and for extravagance in the\nuse of means placed in their hands. Becoming embittered instead\nof repentant, they joined with a few others in unjust recrimination\nagainst Elder and Mrs. White and other leaders, making false charges\nagainst them. Although continuing to advocate the Sabbath truth,\nthey began the publication of a slanderous sheet which they called\nthe Messenger of Truth.\nThey were joined by elders Stephenson and Hall of Wisconsin.\nThese men had been first-day Adventist preachers, who professed\nto accept the truths of the third angel\u2019s message, but who continued\nto hold doctrines regarding the Age-to-Come. According to this\ntheory there was to be, during the millennium, a \u201csecond chance\u201d\nfor salvation. They agreed, however, to preach the message, without\nadvocating this question, if the Review would not publish articles\nagainst it. However, as indicated in the text, they did not keep their\npromise and were soon opposing the Review and its supporters.\nThe course of these \u201copposers of the truth\u201d was soon run. Both\nStephenson and Hall lost their reason. The Messenger of Truth\nAppendix 671\nceased publication in 1857, and early in 1858 Elder White reported\nregarding the party: \u201cNot one of the eighteen messengers of which\nthey once boasted as being with them is now bearing a public testi-\nmony, and not one place of regular meeting of our knowledge among\nthem.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, January 14, 1858.\nPage 190, Systematic Benevolence\u2014In the early days of the\nmessage, men impelled by the urge of conviction went forth to\npreach the new-found truths. They were dependent for their support\nupon their own labors or the freewill offerings of the believers. Such\nan uncertain method was more or less spasmodic and fluctuating.\nEarly in 1859 the need for a more certain plan was felt, and earnest\nstudy was given to the matter. There grew out of this study the plan\ncalled Systematic Benevolence. In harmony with 1 Corinthians 16:2\ngiving regularly on the first day of the week was recommended, and,\nas suggested by 2 Corinthians 8:12-14, an equitable distribution of\nfinancial responsibility. The plan called for brethren to lay by in\nstore weekly from five to twenty-five cents; the sisters, from two to\nten cents; and for property owners to give weekly from one to five\ncents on each hundred dollars worth of assets.\nThe plan was generally received with favor, and here received\nthe endorsement of the spirit of prophecy. The greatest sin in the [715]\nchurch was pointed out to be covetousness. (Page 194.) Systematic\nBenevolence was not presented as a perfected plan, for it was also\nstated that \u201cGod is leading his people\u201d in the matter, and \u201cis bring-\ning\u201d them up. (Page 191.) As plans for support of the work and the\nministry broadened, the spirit of liberality was encouraged more and\nmore until at length light from the Scriptures revealed the system of\ntithes and offerings as they are known in the church today.\nPage 210, Organization\u2014Up to the year 1860 there had been no\nlegal or church organization among the Sabbathkeeping Adventists.\nThey had not even adopted a name. They spoke of themselves as the\n\u201cScattered Flock,\u201d The \u201cLittle Remnant,\u201d or some variation of such\nexpressions. Now Elder White had announced through the Review\nthat he must refuse to continue to assume personal responsibility for\nmoney lent to the Review and Herald office. He further expressed\nthe hope that the time might soon come when \u201cthis people will be\nin that position necessary to be able to get church property insured,\nhold their meeting houses in a proper manner, that those persons\n672 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nmaking their wills, and wishing to do so, can appropriate a portion\nto the publishing department.\u201d He called upon his brethren to make\nsuggestions as to how this desire might be effected so that \u201cwe as a\npeople\u201d might act to secure the above advantages.\nAmong the first responses to this request was one from the\nBrother B referred to in this connection, in which he expressed his\nconviction that it would be wrong to incorporate as a religious body\naccording to law. This he held would be \u201cmaking us a name,\u201d as was\nthe purpose of the builders of the tower of Babel, and would \u201clie\nat the foundation of Babylon.\u201d As for insuring the meeting houses,\nwere they not the Lord\u2019s property, and could he not take care of\nhis own without the aid of insurance companies? Further, said he,\nthose who lend money to the office should not insist on having a\nnote signed by a legal corporation, for \u201cthey lend it to the Lord, and\nthey must trust the Lord for it.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, March\n22, 1860.\nAfter much discussion the misgivings regarding the propriety\nof legally organizing the publishing office were largely overcome,\nand at a conference held in September, 1860, the Advent Review\nPublishing Association was formed. A few months later the name\nwas changed to the Seventh-day Adventist Publishing Association.\nEven after this step there still remained with some a reluctance\nto enter into church organization, and the subject continued to be\ndiscussed. However, with the large majority favoring organization,\nthe movement proceeded, first by the organization of churches, then\nof state conferences, and, finally in 1863, of the General Conference.\nThe testimony on \u201cOrganization\u201d (pages 270-272) speaks of the\nopposition that was encountered in New York State to this move and\nof the vision given regarding it.\nPage 292\u2014The magicians did not really cause their rods to[716]\nbecome serpents; but by magic, aided by the great deceiver, they\nwere able to produce this appearance. It was beyond the power\nof Satan to change the rods to living serpents. The prince of evil,\nthough possessing all the wisdom and might of an angel fallen, has\nnot power to create or to give life; this is the prerogative of God\nalone. But all that was in Satan\u2019s power to do he did; he produced\na counterfeit. To human sight the rods were changed to serpents.\nSuch they were believed to be by Pharaoh and his court. There was\nAppendix 673\nnothing in their appearance to distinguish them from the serpent\nproduced by Moses and Aaron. Thus the testimony speaks of it in\nthe language of the Scriptures; while the same Spirit explains that\nthe Scriptures speak of it as the case appeared. See Testimony No.\n33, vol. 5, 696-698.\nPage 355, \u201cThe Rebellion\u201d\u2014At the time that this testimony was\nwritten, early in 1863, Seventh-day Adventists were faced with a\nserious problem. The nation was at war. Although at heart noncom-\nbatants, the sympathies of the church members were, almost without\nexception, entirely with the government in its opposition to slavery.\nAs the conflict progressed, more and more men were called to the\narmy. At each call every district was under obligation to furnish a\ncertain number of recruits, and when the voluntary enlistments fell\nbelow that number, names were drawn to make up the lack. For a\ntime it was possible by the payment of money to buy a substitute and\nthus release one whose name had been drawn. As there was no pro-\nvision made for assigning Seventh-day Adventists to noncombatant\nservice, and no allowance for Sabbath observance, Sabbathkeepers,\nwhen drafted, usually in this way purchased their exemption. If the\nindividual was unable to raise the money himself, he was helped by\na fund raised for that purpose.\nNow, as more men were needed, and a national conscription\nlaw without such exemption privileges was impending, our brethren\nwere in perplexity regarding their response to such a draft, where\nthey might be compelled to take up arms or to work on the Sabbath.\nA few months prior to the appearance of this testimony, Elder\nWhite had published an editorial in the Review and Herald entitled\n\u201cThe Nation,\u201d to which reference is made on page 356. He believed\nthe government to be the best on earth and fighting for a righteous\ncause. His best counsel at that time was that in the event of drafting\n\u201cit would be madness to resist,\u201d and added:\n\u201cHe who would resist until, in the administration of military law,\nhe was shot down, goes too far, we think, in taking the responsibility\nof suicide.\u201d\u2014The Review and Herald, August 12, 1862.\nThe nature of some of the correspondence that followed this\narticle, as pointed out by Mrs. White, had been such as to lead Elder\nWhite to protest against a virtual charge of \u201cSabbathbreaking and\nmurder\u201d which had been brought against him. Such extremists were [717]\n674 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1\nreproved by Mrs. White on the one hand, and on the other hand a\nnote of warning was sounded to those who were inclined to enlist.\nIn July, 1864, the national conscription law was so amended\nas to revoke the $300 exemption clause. Steps were immediately\ntaken to secure for the Seventh-day Adventist young men the priv-\nileges granted to members of religious denominations who were\nconscientiously opposed to bearing arms\u2014of being assigned to non-\ncombatant service in hospital duty or in caring for freed men. Before\na serious crisis was reached, these efforts were successful. In a\nfew cases Seventh-day Adventist young men were drafted into the\narmy and were assigned to hospital work or other noncombatant\nservice. Whatever their assignment, they tried to let their light shine.\nRegularly for several months there ran through the columns of the\nReview and Herald a listing of receipts for a soldier\u2019s tract fund to\nfurnish literature for distribution among the men.\nThe experiences of Seventh-day Adventists in connection with\nthe Civil War led them to take steps that secured for them a recog-\nnized status as noncombatants, which at the same time enabled them\nto follow the Scriptural injunctions regarding their relationships to\n\u201cthe powers that be,\u201d which \u201care ordained of God.\u201d\nPages 421, 456, Dress Reform\u2014The dresses generally worn\nby women in America at the time this was written (1863, 1867),\nwere very deleterious to health. They were especially objectionable\nbecause of their extreme length, the constriction of the waist by the\ncorset, and the weight of the heavy skirts which were suspended\nfrom the hips. About a decade earlier a few women of national\nprominence initiated a movement to adopt a new style of dress that\nwould be free from these serious objections. The new mode of\ndress was somewhat like the Turkish costume worn by men and\nwomen alike. The movement became so popular that for a time\n\u201cdress reform\u201d conventions were held annually.\n\u201cThe American costume,\u201d here referred to by Mrs. White, was a\nmodification of the earlier style and was sponsored by Dr. Harriet\nAustin of Dansville, New York. It combined the short skirt, \u201creach-\ning about halfway from the hip to the knee,\u201d with mannish-looking\ntrousers, coat, and vest. See description on page 465. This \u201cso-called\nreform dress\u201d was in 1864 shown to Mrs. White to be unsuitable for\nadoption by God\u2019s people.\nAppendix 675\nIn 1865 Mrs. White, through How to Live , No. 6, appealed\nto our sisters to adopt a style of dress which was both modest and\nhealthful. The next year the newly opened Health Reform Institute\nin Battle Creek took steps to design a pattern of dress that would\ncorrect the extremes of the short American costume or the ultra-long\nheavy dresses as commonly worn.\nIn 1867 Testimony No. 11 appeared with its first article, \u201cReform\nin Dress.\u201d See pages 456-466. In this the dress question was fully [718]\nreviewed and further counsel given. A general pattern was recom-\nmended as embodying the principles revealed to Mrs. White, and\nwas referred to as \u201cworthy of the name of the reform short dress.\u201d No\nparticular pattern was revealed to her in vision, and, when discussing\nthe matter at a later date, Mrs. White stated:\n\u201cSome have supposed that the very pattern given was the pattern\nthat all were to adopt. This is not so. But something as simple as\nthis would be the best we could adopt under the circumstances. No\none precise style has been given me as the exact rule to guide all in\ntheir dress.\u201d\u2014E. G. White Letter 19, 1897. Quoted in The Story of\nOur Health Message, 442.\nAs the years passed, the prevailing styles of women\u2019s dress\nchanged for the better, becoming more sensible and healthful. The\nold health reform dress in its exact pattern was no longer urged, but\nthere was ever a uniform testimony borne by Mrs. White regarding\nthe fundamental principles that should guide the Christian in this\nmatter. Thus in 1897 she wrote:\n\u201cLet our sisters dress plainly, as many do, having the dress of\ngood material, durable, modest, appropriate for this age, and let not\nthe dress question fill the mind.\u201d\u2014The Story of Our Health Message,\n442.\nPage 525\u2014For further explanation of the subject of dress the\nreader is referred to Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, No. 30,\narticle, \u201cSimplicity in Dress.\u201d\nPage 689\u2014Since the organization of tract societies in many\nstates, the furnishing of books and tracts to the worthy poor has been\nassumed by them.
