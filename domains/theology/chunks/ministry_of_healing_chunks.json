On every hand there is a seeking for relief.\nIt is not the Creator\u2019s purpose that mankind shall be weighed\ndown with a burden of pain, that his activities shall be curtailed by\nillness, that his strength wane, and his life be cut short by disease.\nBut all too frequently the laws established by God to govern the life\nare flagrantly transgressed; sin enters the heart, and man loses sight\nof his dependence upon God, the source of life and health. Then\nfollow the penalties of transgression\u2014pain, sickness, death.\nTo understand the physical laws governing the body and to bring\nthe life practices into harmony with these laws is a duty of first\nimportance. There is a need for an understanding of the many\nfactors contributing to true happiness\u2014a cheerful home, obedience\nto the laws of life, proper relationship to one\u2019s fellow men.\nWhen sickness comes, it is essential that we employ the varied\nagencies which, in co-operation with nature\u2019s efforts, will build up\nthe body and restore the health. There is, also, a larger and more\nvitally important question\u2014that of our relationship to the Creator\nwho originally gave man his life, who made every provision for his\ncontinued happiness, and who today is interested in his welfare.\nIn this volume, the author, a woman of large experience in the\npractical affairs of life, and one particularly favored with rare insight\nand knowledge, has brought within the reach of every father and\nmother, every man and woman, lay and professional, a vast fund\nof information on life and its laws, on health and its requisites, on [8]\ndisease and its remedies, on the sickness of the soul and the healing\nbalm of Gilead.\nThe book is written in clear, simple, beautiful language, instruc-\ntive to the learner, hopeful to the despondent, cheering to the sick,\nand restful to the weary. Through several decades it has conveyed its\nhelpful message to hundreds of thousands, as it has been issued and\nreissued in many lands, in a dozen of the world\u2019s leading languages.\niii\nThat this work, which presents a better way, revealing to us a\nsimpler, sweeter life, full of joy and gladness, with room for that\nhelpful service which \u201cit is more blessed to give than to receive,\u201d\nmay fully accomplish its mission is the sincere hope of the publishers\nand\nThe Trustees of the Ellen G. White Publications.\nContents\nInformation about this Book . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i\nPreface . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

363\nThe True Medical Missionary [9]\n\u201cTo preach good tidings unto the meek;... to bind up the\nbrokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening\nof the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of\nJehovah\u2019s favor; ... to comfort all that mourn. \u201d\nChapter 1\u2014Our Example[17]\nOur Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied ser-\nvant of man\u2019s necessity. He \u201ctook our infirmities, and bare our sick-\nnesses,\u201d that He might minister to every need of humanity. Matthew\n8:17. The burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to\nremove. It was His mission to bring to men complete restoration;\nHe came to give them health and peace and perfection of character.\nVaried were the circumstances and needs of those who besought\nHis aid, and none who came to Him went away unhelped. From\nHim flowed a stream of healing power, and in body and mind and\nsoul men were made whole.\nThe Saviour\u2019s work was not restricted to any time or place. His\ncompassion knew no limit. On so large a scale did He conduct His\nwork of healing and teaching that there was no building in Palestine\nlarge enough to receive the multitudes that thronged to Him. On the\ngreen hill slopes of Galilee, in the thoroughfares of travel, by the\nseashore, in the synagogues, and in every other place where the sick\ncould be brought to Him, was to be found His hospital. In every city,[18]\nevery town, every village, through which He passed, He laid His\nhands upon the afflicted ones and healed them. Wherever there were\nhearts ready to receive His message, He comforted them with the\nassurance of their heavenly Father\u2019s love. All day He ministered to\nthose who came to Him; in the evening He gave attention to such as\nthrough the day must toil to earn a pittance for the support of their\nfamilies.\nJesus carried the awful weight of responsibility for the salvation\nof men. He knew that unless there was a decided change in the\nprinciples and purposes of the human race, all would be lost. This\nwas the burden of His soul, and none could appreciate the weight\nthat rested upon Him. Through childhood, youth, and manhood\nHe walked alone. Yet it was heaven to be in His presence. Day\nby day He met trials and temptations; day by day He was brought\ninto contact with evil and witnessed its power upon those whom[19]\n12\nOur Example 13\nHe was seeking to bless and to save. Yet He did not fail or become\ndiscouraged.\nIn all things He brought His wishes into strict abeyance to His\nmission. He glorified His life by making everything in it subordinate\nto the will of His Father. When in His youth His mother, finding\nHim in the school of the rabbis, said, \u201cSon, why hast Thou thus\ndealt with us?\u201d He answered,\u2014and His answer is the keynote of His\nlifework,\u2014\u201cHow is it that ye sought Me? wist ye not that I must be\nabout My Father\u2019s business?\u201d Luke 2:48, 49.\nHis life was one of constant self-sacrifice. He had no home in\nthis world except as the kindness of friends provided for Him as a\nwayfarer. He came to live in our behalf the life of the poorest and to\nwalk and work among the needy and the suffering. Unrecognized\nand unhonored, He walked in and out among the people for whom\nHe had done so much.\nHe was always patient and cheerful, and the afflicted hailed Him\nas a messenger of life and peace. He saw the needs of men and\nwomen, children and youth, and to all He gave the invitation, \u201cCome\nunto Me.\u201d\nDuring His ministry, Jesus devoted more time to healing the\nsick than to preaching. His miracles testified to the truth of His\nwords, that He came not to destroy, but to save. Wherever He went,\nthe tidings of His mercy preceded Him. Where He had passed, the\nobjects of His compassion were rejoicing in health and making trial\nof their new-found powers. Crowds were collecting around them to\nhear from their lips the works that the Lord had wrought. His voice\nwas the first sound that many had ever heard, His name the first word\nthey had ever spoken, His face the first they had ever looked upon.\nWhy should they not love Jesus and sound His praise? As He passed\nthrough the towns and cities He was like a vital current, diffusing [20]\nlife and joy.\n\u201cThe land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,\nToward the sea, beyond the Jordan,\nGalilee of the nations,\nThe people that sat in darkness\nSaw a great light,\n14 The Ministry of Healing\nAnd to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,\nTo them did light spring up.\u201d\nMatthew 4:15, 16, A.R.V .,\nmargin.\nThe Saviour made each work of healing an occasion for implant-\ning divine principles in the mind and soul. This was the purpose of\nHis work. He imparted earthly blessings, that He might incline the\nhearts of men to receive the gospel of His grace.\nChrist might have occupied the highest place among the teachers\nof the Jewish nation, but He preferred rather to take the gospel to\nthe poor. He went from place to place, that those in the highways\nand byways might hear the words of truth. By the sea, on the\nmountainside, in the streets of the city, in the synagogue, His voice [21]\nwas heard explaining the Scriptures. Often He taught in the outer\ncourt of the temple, that the Gentiles might hear His words.\nSo unlike the explanations of Scripture given by the scribes and\nPharisees was Christ\u2019s teaching, that the attention of the people was\narrested. The rabbis dwelt upon tradition, upon human theory and\nspeculation. Often that which men had taught and written about the\nScripture was put in place of the Scripture itself. The subject of\nChrist\u2019s teaching was the word of God. He met questioners with\na plain, \u201cIt is written,\u201d \u201cWhat saith the Scripture?\u201d \u201cHow readest\nthou?\u201d At every opportunity when an interest was awakened by\neither friend or foe, He presented the word. With clearness and\npower He proclaimed the gospel message. His words shed a flood of\nlight on the teachings of patriarchs and prophets, and the Scriptures\ncame to men as a new revelation. Never before had His hearers\nperceived in the word of God such depth of meaning. [22]\nNever was there such an evangelist as Christ. He was the Majesty\nof heaven, but He humbled Himself to take our nature, that He might\nmeet men where they were. To all people, rich and poor, free and\nbond, Christ, the Messenger of the covenant, brought the tidings of\nsalvation. His fame as the Great Healer spread throughout Palestine.\nThe sick came to the places through which He would pass, that they\nmight call on Him for help. Hither, too, came many anxious to hear\nHis words and to receive a touch of His hand. Thus He went from\nOur Example 15\ncity to city, from town to town, preaching the gospel and healing the\nsick\u2014the King of glory in the lowly garb of humanity.\nHe attended the great yearly festivals of the nation, and to the\nmultitude absorbed in outward ceremony He spoke of heavenly [23]\nthings, bringing eternity within their view. To all He brought trea-\nsures from the storehouse of wisdom. He spoke to them in language\nso simple that they could not fail of understanding. By methods\npeculiarly His own, He helped all who were in sorrow and affliction.\nWith tender, courteous grace He ministered to the sin-sick soul,\nbringing healing and strength.\nThe prince of teachers, He sought access to the people by the\npathway of their most familiar associations. He presented the truth\nin such a way that ever after it was to His hearers intertwined with\ntheir most hallowed recollections and sympathies. He taught in [24]\na way that made them feel the completeness of His identification\nwith their interests and happiness. His instruction was so direct,\nHis illustrations were so appropriate, His words so sympathetic\nand cheerful, that His hearers were charmed. The simplicity and\nearnestness with which He addressed the needy, hallowed every\nword.\nWhat a busy life He led! Day by day He might have been seen\nentering the humble abodes of want and sorrow, speaking hope to\nthe downcast and peace to the distressed. Gracious, tenderhearted,\npitiful, He went about lifting up the bowed-down and comforting\nthe sorrowful. Wherever He went, He carried blessing.\nWhile He ministered to the poor, Jesus studied also to find ways\nof reaching the rich. He sought the acquaintance of the wealthy\nand cultured Pharisee, the Jewish nobleman, and the Roman ruler.\nHe accepted their invitations, attended their feasts, made Himself\nfamiliar with their interests and occupations, that He might gain [25]\naccess to their hearts, and reveal to them the imperishable riches.\nChrist came to this world to show that by receiving power from\non high, man can live an unsullied life. With unwearying patience\nand sympathetic helpfulness He met men in their necessities. By the\ngentle touch of grace He banished from the soul unrest and doubt,\nchanging enmity to love, and unbelief to confidence.\nHe could say to whom He pleased, \u201cFollow Me,\u201d and the one\naddressed arose and followed Him. The spell of the world\u2019s enchant-\n16 The Ministry of Healing\nment was broken. At the sound of His voice the spirit of greed and\nambition fled from the heart, and men arose, emancipated, to follow\nthe Saviour.\nBrotherly Love\nChrist recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed.\nThe scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and a national\nbenefit of the gifts of heaven and to exclude the rest of God\u2019s family\nin the world. But Christ came to break down every wall of partition.\nHe came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as\nthe air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth.\nThe life of Christ established a religion in which there is no caste,\na religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are linked in\na common brotherhood, equal before God. No question of policy\ninfluenced His movements. He made no difference between neigh-\nbors and strangers, friends and enemies. That which appealed to His\nheart was a soul thirsting for the waters of life.\nHe passed by no human being as worthless, but sought to apply\nthe healing remedy to every soul. In whatever company He found\nHimself He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the cir-[26]\ncumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their fellow\nmen only made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-\nhuman sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and\nmost unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might\nbecome blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would\nmake them manifest as the children of God.\nOften He met those who had drifted under Satan\u2019s control, and\nwho had no power to break from his snare. To such a one, discour-\naged, sick, tempted, fallen, Jesus would speak words of tenderest\npity, words that were needed and could be understood. Others He\nmet who were fighting a hand-to-hand battle with the adversary of\nsouls. These He encouraged to persevere, assuring them that they\nwould win; for angels of God were on their side and would give\nthem the victory.\nAt the table of the publicans He sat as an honored guest, by\nHis sympathy and social kindliness showing that He recognized\nthe dignity of humanity; and men longed to become worthy of His\nOur Example 17\nconfidence. Upon their thirsty hearts His words fell with blessed,\nlife-giving power. New impulses were awakened, and to these out-\ncasts of society there opened the possibility of a new life.\nThough He was a Jew, Jesus mingled freely with the Samaritans,\nsetting at nought the Pharisaic customs of His nation. In face of their\nprejudices He accepted the hospitality of this despised people. He\nslept with them under their roofs, ate with them at their tables,\u2014par-\ntaking of the food prepared and served by their hands,\u2014taught in\ntheir streets, and treated them with the utmost kindness and cour-\ntesy. And while He drew their hearts to Him by the tie of human\nsympathy, His divine grace brought to them the salvation which the\nJews rejected.\nPersonal Ministry [27]\nChrist neglected no opportunity of proclaiming the gospel of\nsalvation. Listen to His wonderful words to that one woman of\nSamaria. He was sitting by Jacob\u2019s well, as the woman came to\ndraw water. To her surprise He asked a favor of her. \u201cGive Me to\ndrink,\u201d He said. He wanted a cool draft, and He wished also to open\nthe way whereby He might give to her the water of life. \u201cHow is\nit,\u201d said the woman, \u201cthat Thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, [28]\nwhich am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with\nthe Samaritans.\u201d Jesus answered, \u201cIf thou knewest the gift of God,\nand who it is that saith to thee, Give Me to drink; thou wouldest\nhave asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water....\nWhosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever\ndrinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the\nwater that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing\nup into everlasting life.\u201d John 4:7-14.\nHow much interest Christ manifested in this one woman! How\nearnest and eloquent were His words! When the woman heard them,\nshe left her waterpot, and went into the city, saying to her friends,\n\u201cCome, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not\nthis the Christ?\u201d We read that \u201cmany of the Samaritans of that city\nbelieved on Him.\u201d Verses 29, 39. And who can estimate the influence\nwhich these words have exerted for the saving of souls in the years\nthat have passed since then?\n18 The Ministry of Healing\nWherever hearts are open to receive the truth, Christ is ready\nto instruct them. He reveals to them the Father, and the service\nacceptable to Him who reads the heart. For such He uses no parables.\nTo them, as to the woman at the well, He says, \u201cI that speak unto\nthee am He.\u201d\nChapter 2\u2014Days of Ministry [29]\nIn the fisherman\u2019s home at Capernaum the mother of Peter\u2019s\nwife is lying sick of \u201ca great fever,\u201d and \u201cthey tell Him of her.\u201d\nJesus \u201ctouched her hand, and the fever left her,\u201d and she arose and\nministered to the Saviour and His disciples. Luke 4:38; Mark 1:30;\nMatthew 8:15.\nRapidly the tidings spread. The miracle had been wrought upon\nthe Sabbath, and for fear of the rabbis the people dared not come for\nhealing until the sun was set. Then from the homes, the shops, the\nmarket places, the inhabitants of the city pressed toward the humble\ndwelling that sheltered Jesus. The sick were brought upon litters,\nthey came leaning upon staffs, or, supported by friends, they tottered\nfeebly into the Saviour\u2019s presence.\nHour after hour they came and went; for none could know\nwhether tomorrow would find the Healer still among them. Never\nbefore had Capernaum witnessed a day like this. The air was filled\nwith the voice of triumph and shouts of deliverance.\nNot until the last sufferer had been relieved did Jesus cease His\nwork. It was far into the night when the multitude departed and [30]\nsilence settled down upon the home of Simon. The long, exciting\nday was past, and Jesus sought rest. But while the city was wrapped\nin slumber, the Saviour, \u201crising up a great while before day,\u201d \u201cwent\nout, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.\u201d Mark 1:35.\nEarly in the morning Peter and his companions came to Jesus,\nsaying that already the people of Capernaum were seeking Him. [31]\nWith surprise they heard Christ\u2019s words, \u201cI must preach the kingdom\nof God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.\u201d Luke 4:43.\nIn the excitement which then pervaded Capernaum there was\ndanger that the object of His mission would be lost sight of. Jesus\nwas not satisfied to attract attention to Himself merely as a wonder-\nworker or as a healer of physical disease. He was seeking to draw\nmen to Him as their Saviour. While the people were eager to believe\nthat He had come as a king to establish an earthly reign, He desired\n19\n20 The Ministry of Healing\nto turn their minds from the earthly to the spiritual. Mere worldly\nsuccess would interfere with His work.\nAnd the wonder of the careless crowd jarred upon His spirits.\nNo self-assertion mingled with His life. The homage which the\nworld gives to position, wealth, or talent was foreign to the Son\nof man. None of the means that men employ to win allegiance or\ncommand homage did Jesus use. Centuries before His birth it had\nbeen prophesied of Him, \u201cHe shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause His\nvoice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall He not break,\nand the dimly burning flax shall He not quench: He shall bring forth[32]\njudgment unto truth.\u201d Isaiah 42:2, 3, margin.\nThe Pharisees sought distinction by their scrupulous ceremoni-\nalism and the ostentation of their worship and their charities. They\nproved their zeal for religion by making it the theme of discussion.\nDisputes between opposing sects were loud and long, and it was not\nunusual to hear on the streets the voice of angry controversy from\nlearned doctors of the law.\nIn marked contrast to all this was the life of Jesus. In that life no\nnoisy disputation, no ostentatious worship, no act to gain applause,\nwas ever witnessed. Christ was hid in God, and God was revealed in\nthe character of His Son. To this revelation Jesus desired the minds\nof the people to be directed.\nThe Sun of Righteousness did not burst upon the world in splen-\ndor, to dazzle the senses with His glory. It is written of Christ, \u201cHis\ngoing forth is prepared as the morning.\u201d Hosea 6:3. Quietly and\ngently the daylight breaks upon the earth, dispelling the darkness\nand waking the world to life. So did the Sun of Righteousness arise,\n\u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2.\n\u201cBehold My Servant, whom I uphold; [33]\nMine Elect, in whom My soul delighteth.\u201d\nIsaiah 42:1.\n\u201cThou hast been a strength to the poor,\nA strength to the needy in his distress,\nA refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat.\u201d\nIsaiah 25:4.\nDays of Ministry 21\n\u201cThus saith God the Lord,\nHe that created the heavens, and stretched them out;\nHe that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it;\nHe that giveth breath unto the people upon it,\nAnd spirit to them that walk therein:\nI the Lord have called Thee in righteousness,\nAnd will hold Thine hand,\nAnd will keep Thee, and give Thee for a covenant of the\npeople,\nFor a light of the Gentiles;\nTo open the blind eyes,\nTo bring out the prisoners from the prison,\nAnd them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\u201d\nIsaiah 42:5-7.\n\u201cI will bring the blind by a way that they knew not;\nI will lead them in paths that they have not known:\nI will make darkness light before them,\nAnd crooked things straight.\nThese things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.\u201d\nVerse 16.\n\u201cSing unto the Lord a new song,\nAnd His praise from the end of the earth,\nYe that go down to the sea, and all that is therein;\nThe isles, and the inhabitants thereof.\nLet the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up the voice,\nThe villages that Kedar doth inhabit:\nLet the inhabitants of the rock sing,\nLet them shout from the top of the mountains.\nLet them give glory unto the Lord,\nAnd declare His praise in the islands.\u201d\nVerses 10-12.\n\u201cSing, O ye heavens; for the Lord hath done it:\nShout, ye lower parts of the earth:\nBreak forth into singing, ye mountains,\n22 The Ministry of Healing\nO forest, and every tree therein:\nFor the Lord hath redeemed Jacob,\nAnd glorified Himself in Israel.\u201d\nIsaiah 44:23.\nFrom Herod\u2019s dungeon, where in disappointment and perplexity[34]\nconcerning the Saviour\u2019s work, John the Baptist watched and waited,\nhe sent two of his disciples to Jesus with the message:\n\u201cArt Thou He that should come, or do we look for another?\u201d\nMatthew 11:3.\nThe Saviour did not at once answer the disciples\u2019 question. As\nthey stood wondering at His silence, the afflicted were coming to\nHim. The voice of the Mighty Healer penetrated the deaf ear. A\nword, a touch of His hand, opened the blind eyes to behold the light\nof day, the scenes of nature, the faces of friends, and the face of the\nDeliverer. His voice reached the ears of the dying, and they arose\nin health and vigor. Paralyzed demoniacs obeyed His word, their\nmadness left them, and they worshiped Him. The poor peasants and\nlaborers, who were shunned by the rabbis as unclean, gathered about\nHim, and He spoke to them the words of eternal life. [35]\nThus the day wore away, the disciples of John seeing and hearing\nall. At last Jesus called them to Him, and bade them go and tell\nJohn what they had seen and heard, adding, \u201cBlessed is he, whoso-\never shall not be offended in Me.\u201d Verse 6. The disciples bore the\nmessage, and it was enough.\nJohn recalled the prophecy concerning the Messiah, \u201cJehovah\nhath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent\nMe to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,\nand the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim\nthe year of Jehovah\u2019s favor, and ... to comfort all that mourn.\u201d Isaiah\n61:1, 2, A.R.V . Jesus of Nazareth was the Promised One. The\nevidence of His divinity was seen in His ministry to the needs of\nsuffering humanity. His glory was shown in His condescension to\nour low estate.\nThe works of Christ not only declared Him to be the Messiah,[36]\nbut showed in what manner His kingdom was to be established.\nTo John was opened the same truth that had come to Elijah in the\ndesert, when \u201ca great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake\nDays of Ministry 23\nin pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the\nwind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the\nearthquake: and after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in\nthe fire:\u201d and after the fire, God spoke to the prophet by a still, small\nvoice. 1 Kings 19:11, 12. So Jesus was to do His work, not by the\noverturning of thrones and kingdoms, not with pomp and outward\ndisplay, but through speaking to the hearts of men by a life of mercy\nand self-sacrifice.\nThe kingdom of God comes not with outward show. It comes\nthrough the gentleness of the inspiration of His word, through the\ninward working of His Spirit, the fellowship of the soul with Him\nwho is its life. The greatest manifestation of its power is seen in\nhuman nature brought to the perfection of the character of Christ.\nThe followers of Christ are to be the light of the world; but God\ndoes not bid them make an effort to shine. He does not approve of\nany self-satisfied endeavor to display superior goodness. He desires\nthat their souls shall be imbued with the principles of heaven; then,\nas they come in contact with the world, they will reveal the light\nthat is in them. Their steadfast fidelity in every act of life will be a\nmeans of illumination.\nWealth or high position, costly equipment, architecture or fur-\nnishings, are not essential to the advancement of the work of God;\nneither are achievements that win applause from men and administer\nto vanity. Worldly display, however imposing, is of no value in [37]\nGod\u2019s sight. Above the seen and temporal, He values the unseen\nand eternal. The former is of worth only as it expresses the latter.\nThe choicest productions of art possess no beauty that can compare\nwith the beauty of character, which is the fruit of the Holy Spirit\u2019s\nworking in the soul.\nWhen God gave His Son to our world, He endowed human beings\nwith imperishable riches\u2014riches compared with which the treasured\nwealth of men since the world began is nothingness. Christ came to\nthe earth and stood before the children of men with the hoarded love\nof eternity, and this is the treasure that, through our connection with\nHim, we are to receive, to reveal, and to impart.\nHuman effort will be efficient in the work of God just according\nto the consecrated devotion of the worker\u2014by revealing the power of\nthe grace of Christ to transform the life. We are to be distinguished\n24 The Ministry of Healing\nfrom the world because God has placed His seal upon us, because\nHe manifests in us His own character of love. Our Redeemer covers\nus with His righteousness.\nIn choosing men and women for His service, God does not ask\nwhether they possess worldly wealth, learning, or eloquence. He\nasks, \u201cDo they walk in such humility that I can teach them My way?\nCan I put My words into their lips? Will they represent Me?\u201d\nGod can use every person just in proportion as He can put His\nSpirit into the soul temple. The work that He will accept is the work\nthat reflects His image. His followers are to bear, as their creden-\ntials to the world, the ineffaceable characteristics of His immortal\nprinciples.\n\u201cHe Shall Gather the Lambs With His Arm\u201d[38]\nAs Jesus ministers in the streets of the cities, mothers with their\nsick and dying little ones in their arms press through the throng,\nseeking to come within reach of His notice.\nBehold these mothers, pale, weary, almost despairing, yet deter-\nmined and persevering. Bearing their burden of suffering, they seek\nthe Saviour. As they are crowded back by the surging throng, Christ\nmakes His way to them step by step, until He is close by their side.\nHope springs up in their hearts. Their tears of gladness fall as they\ncatch His attention, and look into the eyes expressing such pity and\nlove.\nSingling out one of the group, the Saviour invites her confidence,\nsaying, \u201cWhat shall I do for thee?\u201d She sobs out her great want,\n\u201cMaster, that Thou wouldest heal my child.\u201d Christ takes the little\none from her arms, and disease flees at His touch. The pallor of\ndeath is gone; the life-giving current flows through the veins; the[39]\nmuscles receive strength. Words of comfort and peace are spoken\nto the mother; and then another case, just as urgent, is presented.\nAgain Christ exercises His life-giving power, and all give praise and\nhonor to Him who doeth wonderful things.\nWe dwell much on the greatness of Christ\u2019s life. We speak of\nthe wonderful things that He accomplished, of the miracles that He[40]\nwrought. But His attention to things accounted small is even higher\nproof of His greatness.\nDays of Ministry 25\nAmong the Jews it was customary for children to be brought\nto some rabbi, that he might lay his hands upon them in blessing;\nbut the disciples thought the Saviour\u2019s work too important to be\ninterrupted in this way. When the mothers came desiring Him to\nbless their little ones, the disciples looked on them with disfavor.\nThey thought these children too young to be benefited by a visit to\nJesus, and concluded that He would be displeased at their presence. [41]\nBut the Saviour understood the care and burden of the mothers who\nwere seeking to train their children according to the word of God.\nHe had heard their prayers. He Himself had drawn them into His\npresence.\nOne mother with her child had left her home to find Jesus. On\nthe way she told a neighbor her errand, and the neighbor wished\nto have Jesus bless her children. Thus several mothers came here\ntogether, with their little ones. Some of the children had passed\nbeyond the years of infancy to childhood and youth. When the\nmothers made known their desire, Jesus heard with sympathy the\ntimid, tearful request. But He waited to see how the disciples would\ntreat them. When He saw the disciples reproving the mothers and\nsending them away, thinking to do Him a favor, He showed them\ntheir error, saying, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto Me, and\nforbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.\u201d Mark 10:14.\nHe took the children in His arms, He laid His hands upon them, and\ngave them the blessings for which they came.\nThe mothers were comforted. They returned to their homes\nstrengthened and blessed by the words of Christ. They were en-\ncouraged to take up their burden with new cheerfulness and to work\nhopefully for their children.\nCould the afterlife of that little group be opened before us, we\nshould see the mothers recalling to the minds of their children the\nscene of that day, and repeating to them the loving words of the\nSaviour. We should see, too, how often, in after years, the memory\nof these words kept the children from straying from the path cast up\nfor the ransomed of the Lord.\nChrist is today the same compassionate Saviour as when He\nwalked among men. He is as verily the helper of mothers now as\nwhen He gathered the little ones to His arms in Judea. The children [42]\n26 The Ministry of Healing\nof our hearths are as much the purchase of His blood as were the\nchildren of long ago.\nJesus knows the burden of every mother\u2019s heart. He who had a\nmother that struggled with poverty and privation, sympathizes with\nevery mother in her labors. He who made a long journey in order\nto relieve the anxious heart of a Canaanite woman will do as much\nfor the mothers of today. He who gave back to the widow of Nain\nher only son, and in His agony upon the cross remembered His own\nmother, is touched today by the mother\u2019s sorrow. In every grief and\nevery need, He will comfort and help.\nLet mothers come to Jesus with their perplexities. They will\nfind grace sufficient to aid them in the care of their children. The\ngates are open for every mother who would lay her burdens at the\nSaviour\u2019s feet. He who said, \u201cSuffer the little children to come unto\nMe, and forbid them not\u201d (Mark 10:14), still invites mothers to bring\ntheir little ones to be blessed by Him.\nIn the children who were brought in contact with Him, Jesus\nsaw the men and women who should be heirs of His grace and\nsubjects of His kingdom, and some of whom would become martyrs\nfor His sake. He knew that these children would listen to Him and\naccept Him as their Redeemer far more readily than would grown-up\npeople, many of whom were the worldly-wise and hardhearted. In\nteaching, He came down to their level. He, the Majesty of heaven,\nanswered their questions and simplified His important lessons to\nmeet their childish understanding. He planted in their minds the\nseeds of truth, which in after years would spring up and bear fruit\nunto eternal life.\nWhen Jesus told the disciples not to forbid the children to come[43]\nto Him, He was speaking to His followers in all ages\u2014to officers of\nthe church, ministers, helpers, and all Christians. Jesus is drawing\nthe children, and He bids us, \u201cSuffer them to come;\u201d as if He would\nsay, They will come, if you do not hinder them.\nLet not your un-Christlike character misrepresent Jesus. Do not\nkeep the little ones away from Him by your coldness and harshness.\nNever give them cause to feel that heaven would not be a pleas-[44]\nant place to them if you were there. Do not speak of religion as\nsomething that children cannot understand, or act as if they were not\nexpected to accept Christ in their childhood. Do not give them the\nDays of Ministry 27\nfalse impression that the religion of Christ is a religion of gloom,\nand that in coming to the Saviour they must give up all that makes\nlife joyful.\nAs the Holy Spirit moves upon the hearts of the children, co-op-\nerate with His work. Teach them that the Saviour is calling them, that\nnothing can afford Him greater joy than for them to give themselves\nto Him in the bloom and freshness of their years.\nParental Responsibility\nThe Saviour regards with infinite tenderness the souls whom\nHe has purchased with His blood. They are the claim of His love.\nHe looks upon them with unutterable longing. His heart is drawn\nout, not only to the best-trained and most attractive children, but to\nthose who by inheritance and through neglect have objectionable\ntraits of character. Many parents do not understand how much they\nare responsible for these traits in their children. They have not the\ntenderness and wisdom to deal with the erring ones whom they have\nmade what they are. But Jesus looks upon these children with pity.\nHe traces from cause to effect.\nThe Christian worker may be Christ\u2019s agent in drawing these\nfaulty and erring ones to the Saviour. By wisdom and tact he may\nbind them to his heart, he may give courage and hope, and through\nthe grace of Christ may see them transformed in character, so that\nof them it may be said, \u201cOf such is the kingdom of God.\u201d\nFive Small Barley Loaves Feed the Multitude. [45]\nAll day the people had thronged the steps of Christ and His\ndisciples as He taught beside the sea. They had listened to His\ngracious words, so simple and so plain that they were as the balm of\nGilead to their souls. The healing of His divine hand had brought\nhealth to the sick and life to the dying. The day had seemed to them\nlike heaven on earth, and they were unconscious of how long it had\nbeen since they had eaten anything.\nThe sun was sinking in the west, and yet the people lingered.\nFinally the disciples came to Christ, urging that for their own sake\nthe multitude should be sent away. Many had come from far and had\n28 The Ministry of Healing\neaten nothing since morning. In the surrounding towns and villages\nthey might be able to obtain food. But Jesus said, \u201cGive ye them\nto eat.\u201d Matthew 14:16. Then, turning to Philip, He questioned,\n\u201cWhence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\u201d John 6:5.\nPhilip looked over the sea of heads and thought how impossible\nit would be to provide food for so great a company. He answered that\ntwo hundred pennyworth of bread would not be enough to divide\namong them so that each might have a little.\nJesus inquired how much food could be found among the com-\npany. \u201cThere is a lad here,\u201d said Andrew; \u201cwhich hath five barley\nloaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?\u201d\nVerse 9. Jesus directed that these be brought to Him. Then He bade\nthe disciples seat the people on the grass. When this was accom-\nplished, He took the food, \u201cand looking up to heaven, He blessed,[46]\nand brake, and gave the loaves to His disciples, and the disciples to\nthe multitude. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up\nof the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.\u201d Matthew 14:19,[47]\n20.\nIt was by a miracle of divine power that Christ fed the multitude;\nyet how humble was the fare provided\u2014only the fishes and barley\nloaves that were the daily fare of the fisher-folk of Galilee.\nChrist could have spread for the people a rich repast, but food\nprepared merely for the gratification of appetite would have con-\nveyed no lesson for their good. Through this miracle Christ desired\nto teach a lesson of simplicity. If men today were simple in their\nhabits, living in harmony with nature\u2019s laws, as did Adam and Eve\nin the beginning, there would be an abundant supply for the needs\nof the human family. But selfishness and the indulgence of appetite\nhave brought sin and misery, from excess on the one hand, and from\nwant on the other.\nJesus did not seek to attract the people to Him by gratifying\nthe desire for luxury. To that great throng, weary and hungry after\nthe long, exciting day, the simple fare was an assurance both of\nHis power and of His tender care for them in the common needs of\nlife. The Saviour has not promised His followers the luxuries of the\nworld; their lot may be shut in by poverty; but His word is pledged[48]\nthat their need shall be supplied, and He has promised that which is\nbetter than earthly good\u2014the abiding comfort of His own presence.\nDays of Ministry 29\nAfter the multitude had been fed, there was an abundance of\nfood left. Jesus bade His disciples, \u201cGather up the fragments that\nremain, that nothing be lost.\u201d John 6:12. These words meant more\nthan putting the food into baskets. The lesson was twofold. Nothing\nis to be wasted. We are to let slip no temporal advantage. We should\nneglect nothing that would serve to benefit a human being. Let\neverything be gathered up that will relieve the necessities of earth\u2019s\nhungry ones. With the same carefulness are we to treasure the bread\nfrom heaven to satisfy the needs of the soul. By every word of God\nwe are to live. Nothing that God has spoken is to be lost. Not one\nword that concerns our eternal salvation are we to neglect. Not one\nword is to fall useless to the ground.\nThe miracle of the loaves teaches dependence upon God. When\nChrist fed the five thousand, the food was not nigh at hand. Appar-\nently He had no means at His command. There He was, with five\nthousand men, besides women and children, in the wilderness. He\nhad not invited the multitude to follow Him thither. Eager to be in\nHis presence, they had come without invitation or command; but He\nknew that after listening all day to His instruction they were hungry\nand faint. They were far from home, and the night was at hand.\nMany of them were without means to purchase food. He who for\ntheir sake had fasted forty days in the wilderness, would not suffer\nthem to return fasting to their homes.\nThe providence of God had placed Jesus where He was, and He\ndepended on His heavenly Father for means to relieve the necessity. [49]\nWhen we are brought into strait places, we are to depend on God.\nIn every emergency we are to seek help from Him who has infinite\nresources at His command.\nIn this miracle, Christ received from the Father; He imparted\nto the disciples, the disciples to the people, and the people to one\nanother. So all who are united to Christ will receive from Him the\nbread of life, and impart it to others. His disciples are the appointed\nmeans of communication between Christ and the people.\nWhen the disciples heard the Saviour\u2019s direction, \u201cGive ye them\nto eat,\u201d all the difficulties arose in their minds. They questioned,\n\u201cShall we go into the villages to buy food?\u201d But what said Christ?\n\u201cGive ye them to eat.\u201d The disciples brought to Jesus all they had;\nbut He did not invite them to eat. He bade them serve the people.\n30 The Ministry of Healing\nThe food multiplied in His hands, and the hands of the disciples,\nreaching out to Christ, were never unfilled. The little store was\nsufficient for all. When the multitude had been fed, the disciples ate\nwith Jesus of the precious, heaven-supplied food.\nAs we see the necessities of the poor, the ignorant, the afflicted,\nhow often our hearts sink. We question, \u201cWhat avail our feeble\nstrength and slender resources to supply this terrible necessity? Shall\nwe not wait for someone of greater ability to direct the work, or for\nsome organization to undertake it?\u201d Christ says, \u201cGive ye them to\neat.\u201d Use the means, the time, the ability, you have. Bring your\nbarley loaves to Jesus.\nThough your resources may not be sufficient to feed thousands,\nthey may suffice to feed one. In the hand of Christ they may feed\nmany. Like the disciples, give what you have. Christ will multiply\nthe gift. He will reward honest, simple reliance upon Him. That[50]\nwhich seemed but a meager supply will prove to be a rich feast.\n\u201cHe that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that\nsoweth with blessings shall reap also with blessings.... God is able\nto make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all suf-\nficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: as it is\nwritten,\n\u201cHe hath scattered abroad, He hath given to the poor;\nHis righteousness abideth forever.\n\u201cAnd He that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food,\nshall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the\nfruits of your righteousness: ye being enriched in everything unto\nall liberality.\u201d 2 Corinthians 9:6-11, R.V ., margin.\nChapter 3\u2014With Nature and With God [51]\nThe Saviour\u2019s life on earth was a life of communion with nature\nand with God. In this communion He revealed for us the secret of a\nlife of power.\nJesus was an earnest, constant worker. Never lived there among\nmen another so weighted with responsibilities. Never another carried\nso heavy a burden of the world\u2019s sorrow and sin. Never another toiled\nwith such self-consuming zeal for the good of men. Yet His was a\nlife of health. Physically as well as spiritually He was represented\nby the sacrificial lamb, \u201cwithout blemish and without spot.\u201d 1 Peter\n1:19. In body as in soul He was an example of what God designed\nall humanity to be through obedience to His laws.\nAs the people looked upon Jesus, they saw a face in which divine\ncompassion was blended with conscious power. He seemed to be\nsurrounded with an atmosphere of spiritual life. While His manners\nwere gentle and unassuming, He impressed men with a sense of\npower that was hidden, yet could not be wholly concealed.\nDuring His ministry He was continually pursued by crafty and\nhypocritical men who were seeking His life. Spies were on His track, [52]\nwatching His words, to find some occasion against Him. The keenest\nand most highly cultured minds of the nation sought to defeat Him\nin controversy. But never could they gain an advantage. They had\nto retire from the field, confounded and put to shame by the lowly\nTeacher from Galilee. Christ\u2019s teaching had a freshness and a power\nsuch as men had never before known. Even His enemies were forced\nto confess, \u201cNever man spake like this Man.\u201d John 7:46.\nThe childhood of Jesus, spent in poverty, had been uncorrupted\nby the artificial habits of a corrupt age. Working at the carpenter\u2019s\nbench, bearing the burdens of home life, learning the lessons of\nobedience and toil, He found recreation amidst the scenes of nature,\ngathering knowledge as He sought to understand nature\u2019s mysteries.\nHe studied the word of God, and His hours of greatest happiness\nwere found when He could turn aside from the scene of His labors to\n31\n32 The Ministry of Healing\ngo into the fields, to meditate in the quiet valleys, to hold communion\nwith God on the mountainside or amid the trees of the forest. The\nearly morning often found Him in some secluded place, meditating,\nsearching the Scriptures, or in prayer. With the voice of singing\nHe welcomed the morning light. With songs of thanksgiving He\ncheered His hours of labor and brought heaven\u2019s gladness to the\ntoilworn and disheartened.\nDuring His ministry Jesus lived to a great degree an outdoor life.\nHis journeys from place to place were made on foot, and much of\nHis teaching was given in the open air. In training His disciples\nHe often withdrew from the confusion of the city to the quiet of\nthe fields, as more in harmony with the lessons of simplicity, faith,\nand self-abnegation He desired to teach them. It was beneath the\nsheltering trees of the mountainside, but a little distance from the\nSea of Galilee, that the Twelve were called to the apostolate and the[53]\nSermon on the Mount was given.\nChrist loved to gather the people about Him under the blue[54]\nheavens, on some grassy hillside, or on the beach beside the lake.\nHere, surrounded by the works of His own creation, He could turn\ntheir thoughts from the artificial to the natural. In the growth and\ndevelopment of nature were revealed the principles of His kingdom.\nAs men should lift their eyes to the hills of God and behold the\nwonderful works of His hand, they could learn precious lessons of\ndivine truth. In future days the lessons of the divine Teacher would\nthus be repeated to them by the things of nature. The mind would\nbe uplifted and the heart would find rest.\nThe disciples who were associated with Him in His work, Jesus[55]\noften released for a season, that they might visit their homes and\nrest; but in vain were their efforts to draw Him away from His\nlabors. All day He ministered to the throngs that came to Him, and\nat eventide, or in the early morning, He went away to the sanctuary\nof the mountains for communion with His Father.\nOften His incessant labor and the conflict with the enmity and\nfalse teaching of the rabbis left Him so utterly wearied that His\nmother and brothers, and even His disciples, feared that His life\nwould be sacrificed. But as He returned from the hours of prayer[56]\nthat closed the toilsome day, they marked the look of peace upon\nHis face, the freshness and life and power that seemed to pervade\nWith Nature and With God 33\nHis whole being. From hours spent alone with God He came forth,\nmorning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men.\nIt was just after the return from their first missionary tour that\nJesus bade His disciples, Come apart, and rest awhile. The disci-\nples had returned, filled with the joy of their success as heralds of\nthe gospel, when the tidings reached them of the death of John the\nBaptist at the hand of Herod. It was a bitter sorrow and disappoint-\nment. Jesus knew that in leaving the Baptist to die in prison He\nhad severely tested the disciples\u2019 faith. With pitying tenderness He\nlooked upon their sorrowful, tear-stained faces. Tears were in His\nown eyes and voice as He said, \u201cCome ye yourselves apart into a\ndesert place, and rest awhile.\u201d Mark 6:31.\nNear Bethsaida, at the northern end of the Sea of Galilee, was a\nlonely region, beautiful with the fresh green of spring, that offered a\nwelcome retreat to Jesus and His disciples. For this place they set\nout, going in their boat across the lake. Here they could rest, apart\nfrom the confusion of the multitude. Here the disciples could listen\nto the words of Christ, undisturbed by the retorts and accusations of\nthe Pharisees. Here they hoped to enjoy a short season of fellowship\nin the society of their Lord.\nOnly a short time did Jesus have alone with His beloved ones, but\nhow precious to them were those few moments. They talked together\nregarding the work of the gospel and the possibility of making their\nlabor more effective in reaching the people. As Jesus opened to\nthem the treasures of truth, they were vitalized by divine power and\ninspired with hope and courage.\nBut soon He was again sought for by the multitude. Suppos- [57]\ning that He had gone to His usual place of retirement, the people\nfollowed Him thither. His hope to gain even one hour of rest was\nfrustrated. But in the depth of His pure, compassionate heart the\nGood Shepherd of the sheep had only love and pity for these restless,\nthirsting souls. All day He ministered to their needs, and at evening\ndismissed them to go to their homes and rest.\nIn a life wholly devoted to the good of others, the Saviour found [58]\nit necessary to turn aside from ceaseless activity and contact with\nhuman needs, to seek retirement and unbroken communion with His\nFather. As the throng that had followed Him depart, He goes into the\n34 The Ministry of Healing\nmountains, and there, alone with God, pours out His soul in prayer\nfor these suffering, sinful, needy ones.\nWhen Jesus said to His disciples that the harvest was great and\nthe laborers were few, He did not urge upon them the necessity of\nceaseless toil, but bade them, \u201cPray ye therefore the Lord of the\nharvest, that He will send forth laborers into His harvest.\u201d Matthew\n9:38. To His toil-worn workers today as really as to His first disciples\nHe speaks these words of compassion, \u201cCome ye yourselves apart,\n... and rest awhile.\u201d\nAll who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for\ncommunion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God. In\nthem is to be revealed a life that is not in harmony with the world, its\ncustoms, or its practices; and they need to have a personal experience\nin obtaining a knowledge of the will of God. We must individually\nhear Him speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed,\nand in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes\nmore distinct the voice of God. He bids us, \u201cBe still, and know that\nI am God.\u201d Psalm 46:10. This is the effectual preparation for all\nlabor for God. Amidst the hurrying throng, and the strain of life\u2019s\nintense activities, he who is thus refreshed will be surrounded with\nan atmosphere of light and peace. He will receive a new endowment\nof both physical and mental strength. His life will breathe out a\nfragrance, and will reveal a divine power that will reach men\u2019s hearts.\nChapter 4\u2014The Touch of Faith [59]\n\u201cIf I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole.\u201d Matthew 9:21.\nIt was a poor woman who spoke these words\u2014a woman who for\ntwelve years had suffered from a disease that made her life a burden.\nShe had spent all her means upon physicians and remedies, only\nto be pronounced incurable. But as she heard of the Great Healer,\nher hopes revived. She thought, \u201cIf only I could get near enough to\nspeak to Him, I might be healed.\u201d\nChrist was on His way to the home of Jairus, the Jewish rabbi\nwho had entreated Him to come and heal his daughter. The heart-\nbroken petition, \u201cMy little daughter lieth at the point of death: I\npray Thee, come and lay Thy hands on her, that she may be healed\u201d\n(Mark 5:23), had touched the tender, sympathetic heart of Christ,\nand He at once set out with the ruler for his home.\nThey advanced but slowly; for the crowd pressed Christ on every\nside. In making His way through the multitude, the Saviour came\nnear to where the afflicted woman was standing. Again and again\nshe had tried in vain to get near Him. Now her opportunity had\ncome. She could see no way of speaking to Him. She would not [60]\nseek to hinder His slow advance. But she had heard that healing\ncame from a touch of His garments; and, fearful of losing her one\nchance for relief, she pressed forward, saying to herself, \u201cIf I may\nbut touch His garment, I shall be whole.\u201d\nChrist knew every thought of her mind, and He was making His\nway to where she stood. He realized her great need, and He was\nhelping her to exercise faith.\nAs He was passing, she reached forward and succeeded in barely\ntouching the border of His garment. That moment she knew that she\nwas healed. In that one touch was concentrated the faith of her life,\nand instantly her pain and feebleness disappeared. Instantly she felt\nthe thrill as of an electric current passing through every fiber of her\nbeing. There came over her a sensation of perfect health. \u201cShe felt\nin her body that she was healed of that plague.\u201d Verse 29.\n35\n36 The Ministry of Healing\nThe grateful woman desired to express her thanks to the Mighty\nHealer, who had done more for her in one touch than the physicians\nhad done in twelve long years; but she dared not. With a grateful\nheart she tried to withdraw from the crowd. Suddenly Jesus stopped,\nand looking round He asked, \u201cWho touched Me?\u201d\nLooking at Him in amazement, Peter answered, \u201cMaster, the mul-\ntitude throng Thee and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched\nMe?\u201d Luke 8:45.\n\u201cSomebody hath touched Me,\u201d Jesus said; \u201cfor I perceive that\nvirtue is gone out of Me.\u201d Verse 46. He could distinguish the touch\nof faith from the casual touch of the careless throng. Someone had\ntouched Him with a deep purpose and had received answer.\nChrist did not ask the question for His own information. He had\na lesson for the people, for His disciples, and for the woman. He[61]\nwished to inspire the afflicted with hope. He wished to show that it\nwas faith which had brought the healing power. The woman\u2019s trust\nmust not be passed by without comment. God must be glorified by\nher grateful confession. Christ desired her to understand that He\napproved her act of faith. He would not have her depart with a half\nblessing only. She was not to remain in ignorance of His knowledge\nof her suffering, or of His compassionate love and of His approval\nof her faith in His power to save to the uttermost all who come to\nHim.\nLooking toward the woman, Christ insisted on knowing who\nhad touched Him. Finding concealment vain, she came forward\ntrembling, and cast herself at His feet. With grateful tears she told\nHim, before all the people, why she had touched His garment, and\nhow she had been immediately healed. She feared that her act in\ntouching His garment had been one of presumption; but no word of\ncensure came from Christ\u2019s lips. He spoke only words of approval.\nThey came from a heart of love, filled with sympathy for human\nwoe. \u201cDaughter,\u201d He said gently, \u201cbe of good comfort: thy faith hath[62]\nmade thee whole; go in peace.\u201d Verse 48. How cheering were these\nwords to her. Now no fear that she had given offense embittered her\njoy.\nTo the curious crowd pressing about Jesus there was imparted\nno vital power. But the suffering woman who touched Him in faith\nreceived healing. So in spiritual things does the casual contact differ\nTouch of Faith 37\nfrom the touch of faith. To believe in Christ merely as the Saviour of\nthe world can never bring healing to the soul. The faith that is unto\nsalvation is not a mere assent to the truth of the gospel. True faith is\nthat which receives Christ as a personal Saviour. God gave His only-\nbegotten Son, that I, by believing in Him, \u201cshould not perish, but\nhave everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. When I come to Christ, according\nto His word, I am to believe that I receive His saving grace. The life\nthat I now live, I am to \u201clive by the faith of the Son of God, who\nloved me, and gave Himself for me. \u201dGalatians 2:20.\nMany hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction, by\nwhich those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant relation\nwith God. A living faith means an increase of vigor, a confiding\ntrust, by which, through the grace of Christ, the soul becomes a\nconquering power.\nFaith is a mightier conqueror than death. If the sick can be led to\nfix their eyes in faith upon the Mighty Healer, we shall see wonderful\nresults. It will bring life to the body and to the soul.\nIn working for the victims of evil habits, instead of pointing them\nto the despair and ruin toward which they are hastening, turn their\neyes away to Jesus. Fix them upon the glories of the heavenly. This\nwill do more for the saving of body and soul than will all the terrors [63]\nof the grave when kept before the helpless and apparently hopeless.\n\u201cAccording to His Mercy He Saved Us\u201d\nA centurion\u2019s servant was lying sick of the palsy. Among the Ro-\nmans the servants were slaves, bought and sold in the market places,\nand often treated with abuse and cruelty; but the centurion was ten-\nderly attached to his servant, and greatly desired his recovery. He\nbelieved that Jesus could heal him. He had not seen the Saviour, but\nthe reports he had heard inspired him with faith. Notwithstanding the\nformalism of the Jews, this Roman was convinced that their religion\nwas superior to his own. Already he had broken through the barriers\nof national prejudice and hatred that separated the conquerors from\nthe conquered people. He had manifested respect for the service\nof God and had shown kindness to the Jews as His worshipers. In\nthe teaching of Christ, as it had been reported to him, he found that\nwhich met the need of the soul. All that was spiritual within him\n38 The Ministry of Healing\nresponded to the Saviour\u2019s words. But he thought himself unworthy\nto approach Jesus, and he appealed to the Jewish elders to make\nrequest for his servant\u2019s healing.\nThe elders present the case to Jesus, urging that \u201che was worthy\nfor whom He should do this: for he loveth our nation, and he hath\nbuilt us a synagogue.\u201d Luke 7:4, 5.\nBut on the way to the centurion\u2019s home, Jesus receives a message\nfrom the officer himself, \u201cLord, trouble not Thyself: for I am not\nworthy that Thou shouldest enter under my roof.\u201d Verse 6.\nStill the Saviour keeps on His way, and the centurion comes in[64]\nperson to complete the message, saying, \u201cNeither thought I myself\nworthy to come unto Thee,\u201d \u201cbut speak the word only, and my servant\nshall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers\nunder me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another,\nCome, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\u201d\nVerse 7; Matthew 8:8, 9.\n\u201cI represent the power of Rome, and my soldiers recognize my\nauthority as supreme. So dost Thou represent the power of the\ninfinite God, and all created things obey Thy word. Thou canst\ncommand the disease to depart, and it shall obey Thee. Speak but\nthe word, and my servant shall be healed.\u201d\n\u201cAs thou hast believed,\u201d Christ said, \u201cso be it done unto thee.[65]\nAnd his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.\u201d Verse 13.\nThe Jewish elders had commended the centurion to Christ be-\ncause of the favor he had shown to \u201cour nation.\u201d He is worthy, they\nsaid, for \u201che hath built us a synagogue.\u201d But the centurion said of\nhimself, \u201cI am not worthy.\u201d Yet he did not fear to ask help from\nJesus. Not to his own goodness did he trust, but to the Saviour\u2019s\nmercy. His only argument was his great need.\nIn the same way every human being can come to Christ. \u201cNot by\nworks of righteousness which we have done, but according to His\nmercy He saved us.\u201d Titus 3:5. Do you feel that because you are a\nsinner you cannot hope to receive blessing from God? Remember\nthat Christ came into the world to save sinners. We have nothing to\nrecommend us to God; the plea that we may urge now and ever is\nour utterly helpless condition, which makes His redeeming power\na necessity. Renouncing all self-dependence, we may look to the\ncross of Calvary and say:\nTouch of Faith 39\n\u201cIn my hand no price I bring;\nSimply to Thy cross I cling.\u201d\n\u201cIf thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that be-\nlieveth.\u201d Mark 9:23. It is faith that connects us with heaven and\nbrings us strength for coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ,\nGod has provided means for subduing every evil trait and resisting [66]\nevery temptation, however strong. But many feel that they lack faith,\nand therefore they remain away from Christ. Let these souls, in\ntheir helpless unworthiness, cast themselves upon the mercy of their\ncompassionate Saviour. Look not to self, but to Christ. He who\nhealed the sick and cast out demons when He walked among men is\nstill the same mighty Redeemer. Then grasp His promises as leaves\nfrom the tree of life: \u201cHim that cometh to Me I will in no wise\ncast out.\u201d John 6:37. As you come to Him, believe that He accepts\nyou, because He has promised. You can never perish while you do\nthis\u2014never.\n\u201cGod commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were\nyet sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d Romans 5:8.\nAnd \u201cif God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared\nnot His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not\nwith Him also freely give us all things?\u201d Romans 8:31, 32.\n\u201cI am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor\nprincipalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,\nnor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate\nus from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\u201d Verses\n38, 39, A.R.V ., margin.\n\u201cThou Canst Make Me Clean\u201d [67]\nOf all the diseases known in the East the leprosy was most\ndreaded. Its incurable and contagious character, and its horrible\neffect upon its victims, filled the bravest with fear. Among the Jews\nit was regarded as a judgment on account of sin, and hence was\ncalled \u201cthe stroke,\u201d \u201cthe finger of God.\u201d Deep-rooted, ineradicable,\ndeadly, it was looked upon as a symbol of sin.\nBy the ritual law the leper was pronounced unclean. Whatever\nhe touched was unclean. The air was polluted by his breath. Like\n40 The Ministry of Healing\none already dead, he was shut out from the habitations of men. One\nwho was suspected of having the disease must present himself to the\npriests, who were to examine and decide his case. If pronounced a\nleper, he was isolated from his family, cut off from the congregation\nof Israel, and doomed to associate with those only who were simi-\nlarly afflicted. Even kings and rulers were not exempt. A monarch\nattacked by this terrible disease must yield up the scepter and flee\nfrom society.\nAway from his friends and his kindred the leper must bear the\ncurse of his malady. He was obliged to publish his own calamity, to\nrend his garments, and sound the alarm, warning all to flee from his\ncontaminating presence. The cry, \u201cUnclean! unclean!\u201d coming in\nmournful tones from the lonely exile, was a signal heard with fear\nand abhorrence.\nIn the region of Christ\u2019s ministry were many of these sufferers,[68]\nand as the news of His work reached them, there is one in whose\nheart faith begins to spring up. If he could go to Jesus he might be\nhealed. But how can he find Jesus? Doomed as he is to perpetual\nisolation, how can he present himself to the Healer? And will Christ\nheal him? Will He not, like the Pharisees, and even the physicians\npronounce a curse upon him and warn him to flee from the haunts\nof men?\nHe thinks of all that has been told him of Jesus. Not one who has\nsought His help has been turned away. The wretched man determines\nto find the Saviour. Though shut out from the cities, it may be that\nhe can cross His path in some byway along the mountain roads, or\nfind Him as He is teaching outside the towns. The difficulties are\ngreat, but this is his only hope.\nStanding afar off, the leper catches a few words from the\nSaviour\u2019s lips. He sees Him laying His hands upon the sick. He\nsees the lame, the blind, the paralytic, and those dying of various\nmaladies rise up in health, praising God for deliverance. His faith\nstrengthens. Nearer and yet nearer he approaches to the listening\nthrong. The restrictions laid upon him, the safety of the people, the\nfear with which all men regard him, are alike forgotten. He thinks[69]\nonly of the blessed hope of healing.\nHe is a loathsome spectacle. The disease has made frightful\ninroads, and his decaying body is horrible to look upon. At sight\nTouch of Faith 41\nof him the people fall back. In their terror they crowd upon one\nanother to escape from contact with him. Some try to prevent him\nfrom approaching Jesus, but in vain. He neither sees nor hears them.\nTheir expressions of loathing are lost upon him. He sees only the\nSon of God, he hears only the voice that speaks life to the dying.\nPressing to Jesus, he casts himself at His feet with the cry, \u201cLord,\nif Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean.\u201d\nJesus replies, \u201cI will; be thou clean,\u201d and lays His hand upon\nhim. Matthew 8:2, 3.\nImmediately a change passes over the leper. His blood becomes\nhealthy, the nerves sensitive, the muscles firm. The unnaturally\nwhite, scaly surface peculiar to leprosy disappears; and his flesh\nbecomes as the flesh of a little child.\nShould the priests learn the facts concerning the healing of the\nleper, their hatred of Christ might lead them to render a dishonest\nsentence. Jesus desired that an impartial decision be secured. He\ntherefore bids the man tell no one of the cure, but without delay\npresent himself at the temple with an offering before any rumors\nconcerning the miracle should be spread abroad. Before the priests\ncould accept such an offering, they were required to examine the\nofferer and certify his complete recovery.\nThis examination was made. The priests who had condemned\nthe leper to banishment testified to his cure. The healed man was\nrestored to his home and society. He felt that the boon of health\nwas very precious. He rejoiced in the vigor of manhood and in his\nrestoration to his family. Notwithstanding the caution of Jesus, he [70]\ncould no longer conceal the fact of his cure, and joyfully he went\nabout proclaiming the power of the One who had made him whole.\nWhen this man came to Jesus, he was \u201cfull of leprosy,\u201d Its\ndeadly poison permeated his whole body. The disciples sought\nto prevent their Master from touching him; for he who touched a\nleper became himself unclean. But in laying His hand upon the\nleper, Jesus received no defilement. The leprosy was cleansed. Thus\nit is with the leprosy of sin\u2014deep-rooted, deadly, impossible to be\ncleansed by human power. \u201cThe whole head is sick, and the whole\nheart faint. From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is\nno soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores.\u201d\nIsaiah 1:5, 6. But Jesus, coming to dwell in humanity, receives no\n42 The Ministry of Healing\npollution. His presence was healing virtue for the sinner. Whoever\nwill fall at His feet, saying in faith, \u201cLord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst\nmake me clean,\u201d shall hear the answer, \u201cI will; be thou clean.\u201d\nIn some instances of healing, Jesus did not at once grant the\nblessing sought. But in the case of leprosy no sooner was the appeal\nmade than it was granted. When we pray for earthly blessings, the\nanswer to our prayer may be delayed, or God may give us something\nother than we ask; but not so when we ask for deliverance from\nsin. It is His will to cleanse us from sin, to make us His children,\nand to enable us to live a holy life. Christ \u201cgave Himself for our\nsins, that He might deliver us from this present evil world, according\nto the will of God and our Father.\u201d Galatians 1:4. \u201cAnd this is the\nconfidence that we have in Him, that, if we ask anything according to\nHis will, He heareth us: and if we know that He hear us, whatsoever\nwe ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.\u201d\n1 John 5:14, 15.\nJesus looked upon the distressed and heart-burdened, those[71]\nwhose hopes were blighted, and who with earthly joys were seeking\nto quiet the longing of the soul, and He invited all to find rest in\nHim.\n\u201cYe Shall Find Rest\u201d\nTenderly He bade the toiling people, \u201cTake My yoke upon you,\nand learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find\nrest unto your souls.\u201d Matthew 11:29.\nIn these words, Christ was speaking to every human being.\nWhether they know it or not, all are weary and heavy-laden. All\nare weighed down with burdens that only Christ can remove. The\nheaviest burden that we bear is the burden of sin. If we were left to\nbear this burden, it would crush us. But the Sinless One has taken\nour place. \u201cThe Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all.\u201d Isaiah\n53:6.\nHe has borne the burden of our guilt. He will take the load from\nour weary shoulders. He will give us rest. The burden of care and\nsorrow also He will bear. He invites us to cast all our care upon Him;\nfor He carries us upon His heart.\nTouch of Faith 43\nThe Elder Brother of our race is by the eternal throne. He looks\nupon every soul who is turning his face toward Him as the Saviour.\nHe knows by experience what are the weaknesses of humanity, what\nare our wants, and where lies the strength of our temptations; for He\nwas \u201cin all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.\u201d Hebrews\n4:15. He is watching over you, trembling child of God. Are you\ntempted? He will deliver. Are you weak? He will strengthen. Are\nyou ignorant? He will enlighten. Are you wounded? He will heal.\nThe Lord \u201ctelleth the number of the stars;\u201d and yet \u201cHe healeth the\nbroken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.\u201d Psalm 147:4, 3.\nWhatever your anxieties and trials, spread out your case before [72]\nthe Lord. Your spirit will be braced for endurance. The way will\nbe open for you to disentangle yourself from embarrassment and\ndifficulty. The weaker and more helpless you know yourself to be,\nthe stronger will you become in His strength. The heavier your\nburdens, the more blessed the rest in casting them upon your Burden\nBearer.\nCircumstances may separate friends; the restless waters of the\nwide sea may roll between us and them. But no circumstances, no\ndistance, can separate us from the Saviour. Wherever we may be,\nHe is at our right hand, to support, maintain, uphold, and cheer.\nGreater than the love of a mother for her child is Christ\u2019s love for\nHis redeemed. It is our privilege to rest in His love, to say, \u201cI will\ntrust Him; for He gave His life for me.\u201d\nHuman love may change, but Christ\u2019s love knows no change.\nWhen we cry to Him for help, His hand is stretched out to save.\n\u201cThe mountains may depart,\nAnd the hills be removed;\nBut My loving-kindness shall not depart from thee,\nNeither shall My covenant of peace be removed,\nSaith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee.\u201d\nIsaiah 54:10, A.R.V .\nChapter 5\u2014Healing of the Soul[73]\nMany of those who came to Christ for help had brought disease\nupon themselves, yet He did not refuse to heal them. And when\nvirtue from Him entered into these souls, they were convicted of sin,\nand many were healed of their spiritual disease as well as of their\nphysical maladies.\nAmong these was the paralytic at Capernaum. Like the leper,\nthis paralytic had lost all hope of recovery. His disease was the result\nof a sinful life, and his sufferings were embittered by remorse. In\nvain he had appealed to the Pharisees and doctors for relief; they\npronounced him incurable, they denounced him as a sinner and\ndeclared that he would die under the wrath of God.\nThe palsied man had sunk into despair. Then he heard of the\nworks of Jesus. Others, as sinful and helpless as he, had been healed,\nand he was encouraged to believe that he, too, might be cured if he\ncould be carried to the Saviour. But hope fell as he remembered the\ncause of his malady, yet he could not cast away the possibility of\nhealing.\nHis great desire was relief from the burden of sin. He longed to[74]\nsee Jesus and receive the assurance of forgiveness and peace with\nheaven. Then he would be content to live or to die, according to\nGod\u2019s will.\nThere was no time to lose; already his wasted flesh bore signs of\ndeath. He besought his friends to carry him on his bed to Jesus, and\nthis they gladly undertook to do. But so dense was the crowd that\nhad assembled in and about the house where the Saviour was, that\nit was impossible for the sick man and his friends to reach Him, or[75]\neven to come within hearing of His voice. Jesus was teaching in the\nhome of Peter. According to their custom, His disciples sat close\nabout Him, and \u201cthere were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting\nby, who were come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and\nJerusalem.\u201d Luke 5:17, A.R.V . Many of these had come as spies,\nseeking an accusation against Jesus. Beyond these thronged the\n44\nHealing of the Soul 45\npromiscuous multitude, the eager, the reverent, the curious, and the\nunbelieving. Different nationalities and all grades of society were\nrepresented. \u201cAnd the power of the Lord was present to heal.\u201d Verse\n17. The Spirit of life brooded over the assembly, but Pharisees and\ndoctors did not discern His presence. They felt no sense of need,\nand the healing was not for them. \u201cHe hath filled the hungry with\ngood things; and the rich He hath sent empty away.\u201d Luke 1:53.\nAgain and again the bearers of the paralytic tried to push their\nway through the crowd, but in vain. The sick man looked about\nhim in unutterable anguish. How could he relinquish hope when the\nlonged-for help was so near? At his suggestion his friends bore him\nto the top of the house and, breaking up the roof, let him down at\nthe feet of Jesus.\nThe discourse was interrupted. The Saviour looked upon the\nmournful countenance and saw the pleading eyes fixed upon Him.\nWell He knew the longing of that burdened soul. It was Christ who\nhad brought conviction to his conscience when he was yet at home.\nWhen he repented of his sins and believed in the power of Jesus to\nmake him whole, the mercy of the Saviour had blessed his heart.\nJesus had watched the first glimmer of faith grow into a conviction\nthat He was the sinner\u2019s only helper, and had seen it grow stronger\nwith every effort to come into His presence. It was Christ who had\ndrawn the sufferer to Himself. Now, in words that fell like music on [76]\nthe listener\u2019s ear, the Saviour said, \u201cSon, be of good cheer; thy sins\nbe forgiven thee.\u201d Matthew 9:2.\nThe burden of guilt rolls from the sick man\u2019s soul. He cannot\ndoubt. Christ\u2019s words reveal His power to read the heart. Who can\ndeny His power to forgive sins? Hope takes the place of despair, and\njoy of oppressive gloom. The man\u2019s physical pain is gone, and his\nwhole being is transformed. Making no further request, he lay in\npeaceful silence, too happy for words.\nMany were watching with breathless interest every movement\nin this strange transaction. Many felt that Christ\u2019s words were an\ninvitation to them. Were they not soul-sick because of sin? Were\nthey not anxious to be freed from this burden?\nBut the Pharisees, fearful of losing their influence with the mul-\ntitude, said in their hearts, \u201cHe blasphemeth: who can forgive sins\nbut One, even God?\u201d Mark 2:7, R.V .\n46 The Ministry of Healing\nFixing His glance upon them, beneath which they cowered and\ndrew back, Jesus said, \u201cWherefore think ye evil in your hearts? For\nwhether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise,\nand walk? But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on[77]\nearth to forgive sins,\u201d He said, turning to the paralytic, \u201cArise, take\nup thy bed, and go unto thine house.\u201d Matthew 9:4-6.\nThen he who had been borne on a litter to Jesus rose to his\nfeet with the elasticity and strength of youth. And immediately he\n\u201ctook up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they\nwere all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this\nfashion.\u201d Mark 2:12.\nIt required nothing less than creative power to restore health to\nthat decaying body. The same voice that spoke life to man created\nfrom the dust of the earth, had spoken life to the dying paralytic.\nAnd the same power that gave life to the body had renewed the\nheart. He who at creation \u201cspake, and it was,\u201d who \u201ccommanded,\nand it stood fast\u201d (Psalm 33:9), had spoken life to the soul dead in\ntrespasses and sins. The healing of the body was an evidence of the\npower that had renewed the heart. Christ bade the paralytic arise and\nwalk, \u201cthat ye may know,\u201d He said, \u201cthat the Son of man hath power\non earth to forgive sins.\u201d\nThe paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the\nbody. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health\nof body. Before the physical malady could be healed, Christ must\nbring relief to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. This lesson\nshould not be overlooked. There are today thousands suffering\nfrom physical disease who, like the paralytic, are longing for the\nmessage, \u201cThy sins are forgiven.\u201d The burden of sin, with its unrest\nand unsatisfied desires, is the foundation of their maladies. They\ncan find no relief until they come to the Healer of the soul. The\npeace which He alone can impart would restore vigor to the mind\nand health to the body.\nThe effect produced upon the people by the healing of the par-[78]\nalytic was as if heaven had opened and revealed the glories of the\nbetter world. As the man who had been cured passed through the\nthrong, blessing God at every step and bearing his burden as if it\nwere a feather\u2019s weight, the people fell back to give him room and\nwith awe-stricken faces gazed upon him, whispering softly among[79]\nHealing of the Soul 47\nthemselves, \u201cWe have seen strange things today.\u201d Luke 5:26.\nIn the home of the paralytic there was great rejoicing when he\nreturned to his family, carrying with ease the couch upon which he\nhad been slowly borne from their presence but a short time before.\nThey gathered round with tears of joy, hardly daring to believe their\neyes. He stood before them in the full vigor of manhood. Those\narms that they had seen lifeless were quick to obey his will. The\nflesh that had been shrunken and leaden-hued was now fresh and\nruddy. He walked with a firm, free step. Joy and hope were written\nin every lineament of his countenance, and an expression of purity\nand peace had taken the place of the marks of sin and suffering. Glad\nthanksgiving went up from that home, and God was glorified through\nHis Son, who had restored hope to the hopeless and strength to the\nstricken one. This man and his family were ready to lay down their\nlives for Jesus. No doubt dimmed their faith, no unbelief marred\ntheir fealty to Him who had brought light into their darkened home.\n\u201cBless the Lord, O my soul:\nAnd all that is within me, bless His holy name.\nBless the Lord, O my soul,\nAnd forget not all His benefits:\nWho forgiveth all thine iniquities;\nWho healeth all thy diseases;\nWho redeemeth thy life from destruction;...\nSo that thy youth is renewed like the eagle\u2019s.\nThe Lord executeth righteousness\nAnd judgment for all that are oppressed....\nHe hath not dealt with us after our sins;\nNor rewarded us according to our iniquities....\nLike as a father pitieth his children,\nSo the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\nFor He knoweth our frame;\nHe remembereth that we are dust.\u201d\nPsalm 103:1-14.\n48 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cWilt Thou Be Made Whole?\u201d[80]\n[81] \u201cNow there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which\nis called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. In\nthese lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered,\nwaiting for the moving of the water.\u201d John 5:2, 3.\nAt certain seasons the waters of this pool were agitated, and\nit was commonly believed that this was the result of supernatural\npower, and that whoever first after the troubling of the pool stepped\ninto the waters, would be healed of whatever disease he might have.\nHundreds of sufferers visited the place; but so great was the crowd\nwhen the water was troubled that they rushed forward, trampling,\nunderfoot men, women, and children, weaker than themselves. Many\ncould not get near the pool. Many who had succeeded in reaching\nit died upon its bank. Shelters had been erected about the place,\nthat the sick might be protected from the heat by the day and the\nchilliness of the night. There were some who spent the night in these\nporches, creeping to the edge of the pool day after day, in the vain\nhope of relief.\nJesus was at Jerusalem. Walking alone in apparent meditation\nand prayer, He came to the pool. He saw the wretched sufferers\nwatching for that which they supposed to be their only chance of\ncure. He longed to exercise His healing power and make every\nsufferer whole. But it was the Sabbath day. Multitudes were going\nto the temple for worship, and He knew that such an act of healing\nwould so excite the prejudice of the Jews as to cut short His work.\nBut the Saviour saw one case of supreme wretchedness. It was\nthat of a man who had been a helpless cripple for thirty-eight years.\nHis disease was in a great degree the result of his own evil habits[82]\nand was looked upon as a judgment from God. Alone and friendless,\nfeeling that he was shut out from God\u2019s mercy, the sufferer had\npassed long years of misery. At the time when it was expected that\nthe water would be troubled, those who pitied his helplessness would\nbear him to the porches. But at the favored moment he had no one\nto help him in. He had seen the rippling of the water, but had never\nbeen able to get farther than the edge of the pool. Others stronger\nthan he would plunge in before him. The poor, helpless sufferer was\nunable to contend successfully with the scrambling, selfish crowd.\nHealing of the Soul 49\nHis persistent efforts toward the one object, and his anxiety and [83]\ncontinual disappointment, were fast wearing away the remnant of\nhis strength.\nThe sick man was lying on his mat and occasionally lifting his\nhead to gaze at the pool, when a tender, compassionate face bent\nover him, and the words, \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d arrested his\nattention. Hope came to his heart. He felt that in some way he\nwas to have help. But the glow of encouragement soon faded. He\nremembered how often he had tried to reach the pool, and now\nhe had little prospect of living till it should again be troubled. He\nturned away wearily, saying, \u201cSir, I have no man, when the water is\ntroubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another\nsteppeth down before me.\u201d\nJesus bids him, \u201cRise, take up thy bed, and walk.\u201d Verses 6-8. [84]\nWith a new hope the sick man looks upon Jesus. The expression of\nHis countenance, the tones of His voice, are like no other. Love and\npower seem to breathe from His very presence. The cripple\u2019s faith\ntakes hold upon Christ\u2019s word. Without question he sets his will to\nobey, and, as he does this, his whole body responds.\nEvery nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful action\ncomes to his crippled limbs. Springing to his feet, he goes on his\nway with firm, free step, praising God and rejoicing in his new-found\nstrength.\nJesus had given the palsied man no assurance of divine help. The\nman might have said, \u201cLord, if Thou wilt make me whole, I will\nobey Thy word.\u201d He might have stopped to doubt, and thus have\nlost his one chance of healing. But no, he believed Christ\u2019s word,\nbelieved that he was made whole; immediately he made the effort,\nand God gave him the power; he willed to walk, and he did walk.\nActing on the word of Christ, he was made whole.\nBy sin we have been severed from the life of God. Our souls\nare palsied. Of ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy\nlife than was the impotent man capable of walking. Many realize\ntheir helplessness; they are longing for that spiritual life which will\nbring them into harmony with God, and are striving to obtain it. But\nin vain. In despair they cry, \u201cO wretched man that I am! who shall\ndeliver me from this body of death?\u201d Romans 7:24, margin. Let\nthese desponding, struggling ones look up. The Saviour is bending\n50 The Ministry of Healing\nover the purchase of His blood, saying with inexpressible tenderness\nand pity, \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d He bids you arise in health[85]\nand peace. Do not wait to feel that you are made whole. Believe\nthe Saviour\u2019s word. Put your will on the side of Christ. Will to\nserve Him, and in acting upon His word you will receive strength.\nWhatever may be the evil practice, the master passion which through\nlong indulgence binds both soul and body, Christ is able and longs\nto deliver. He will impart life to the soul that is \u201cdead in trespasses.\u201d\nEphesians 2:1. He will set free the captive that is held by weakness\nand misfortune and the chains of sin.\nThe sense of sin has poisoned the springs of life. But Christ says,\n\u201cI will take your sins; I will give you peace. I have bought you with\nMy blood. You are Mine. My grace shall strengthen your weakened\nwill; your remorse for sin I will remove.\u201d When temptations assail\nyou, when care and perplexity surround you, when, depressed and\ndiscouraged, you are ready to yield to despair, look to Jesus, and\nthe darkness that encompasses you will be dispelled by the bright\nshining of His presence. When sin struggles for the mastery in\nyour soul, and burdens the conscience, look to the Saviour. His\ngrace is sufficient to subdue sin. Let your grateful heart, trembling\nwith uncertainty, turn to Him. Lay hold on the hope set before you.\nChrist waits to adopt you into His family. His strength will help\nyour weakness; He will lead you step by step. Place your hand in\nHis, and let Him guide you.\nNever feel that Christ is far away. He is always near. His loving\npresence surrounds you. Seek Him as One who desires to be found\nof you. He desires you not only to touch His garments, but to walk\nwith Him in constant communion.\n\u201cGo, and Sin No More\u201d[86]\nThe Feast of Tabernacles had just ended. The priests and rabbis\nat Jerusalem had been defeated in their plottings against Jesus, and,\nas evening fell, \u201cevery man went unto his own house. Jesus went\nunto the Mount of Olives.\u201d John 7:53; 8:1.\nFrom the excitement and confusion of the city, from the eager\ncrowds and the treacherous rabbis, Jesus turned away to the quiet\nof the olive groves, where He could be alone with God. But in the[87]\nHealing of the Soul 51\nearly morning He returned to the temple; and as the people gathered\nabout Him, He sat down and taught them.\nHe was soon interrupted. A group of Pharisees and scribes ap-\nproached Him, dragging with them a terror-stricken woman, whom\nwith hard, eager voices they accused of having violated the seventh\ncommandment. Pushing her into the presence of Jesus, they said,\nwith a hypocritical display of respect, \u201cMaster, this woman was\ntaken in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses in the law commanded\nus, that such should be stoned: but what sayest Thou?\u201d Verses 4, 5.\nTheir pretended reverence veiled a deep-laid plot for His ruin. [88]\nShould Jesus acquit the woman, He might be charged with despising\nthe law of Moses. Should He declare her worthy of death, He could\nbe accused to the Romans as one who assumed authority belonging\nonly to them.\nJesus looked upon the scene\u2014the trembling victim in her shame,\nthe hard-faced dignitaries, devoid of even human pity. His spirit of\nstainless purity shrank from the spectacle. Giving no sign that He\nhad heard the question, He stooped and, fixing His eyes upon the\nground, began to write in the dust.\nImpatient at His delay and apparent indifference the accusers\ndrew nearer, urging the matter upon His attention. But as their eyes,\nfollowing those of Jesus, fell upon the pavement at His feet, their\nvoices were silenced. There, traced before them, were the guilty\nsecrets of their own lives.\nRising, and fixing His eyes upon the plotting elders, Jesus said,\n\u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d\nVerse 7. And, stooping down, He continued writing.\nHe had not set aside the Mosaic law nor infringed upon the au-\nthority of Rome. The accusers were defeated. Now, their robes\nof pretended holiness torn from them, they stood, guilty and con-\ndemned, in the presence of infinite purity. Trembling lest the hidden\niniquity of their lives should be laid open to the multitude, with\nbowed heads and downcast eyes they stole away, leaving their victim\nwith the pitying Saviour.\nJesus arose and, looking upon the woman, said, \u201cWhere are\nthose thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No\nman, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go,\nand sin no more.\u201d Verses 10, 11.\n52 The Ministry of Healing\nThe woman had stood before Jesus, cowering with fear. His[89]\nwords, \u201cHe that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone,\u201d\nhad come to her as a death sentence. She dared not lift her eyes to\nthe Saviour\u2019s face, but silently awaited her doom. In astonishment\nshe saw her accusers depart speechless and confounded; then those\nwords of hope fell upon her ear, \u201cNeither do I condemn thee: go,\nand sin no more.\u201d Her heart was melted, and, casting herself at the\nfeet of Jesus, she sobbed out her grateful love and with bitter tears\nconfessed her sins.\nThis was to her the beginning of a new life, a life of purity\nand peace, devoted to God. In the uplifting of this fallen soul,\nJesus performed a greater miracle than in healing the most grievous\nphysical disease; He cured the spiritual malady which is unto death\neverlasting. This penitent woman became one of His most steadfast\nfollowers. With self-sacrificing love and devotion she showed her\ngratitude for His forgiving mercy. For this erring woman the world\nhad only contempt and scorn, but the Sinless One pitied her weakness\nand reached to her a helping hand. While the hypocritical Pharisees\ndenounced, Jesus bade her, \u201cGo, and sin no more.\u201d\nJesus knows the circumstances of every soul. The greater the\nsinner\u2019s guilt, the more he needs the Saviour. His heart of divine[90]\nlove and sympathy is drawn out most of all for the one who is the\nmost hopelessly entangled in the snares of the enemy. With His own\nblood He has signed the emancipation papers of the race.\nJesus does not desire those who have been purchased at such\na cost to become the sport of the enemy\u2019s temptations. He does\nnot desire us to be overcome and perish. He who curbed the lions\nin their den, and walked with His faithful witnesses amid the fiery\nflames, is just as ready to work in our behalf to subdue every evil in\nour nature. Today He is standing at the altar of mercy, presenting\nbefore God the prayers of those who desire His help. He turns no\nweeping, contrite one away. Freely will He pardon all who come\nto Him for forgiveness and restoration. He does not tell to any all\nthat He might reveal, but He bids every trembling soul take courage.\nWhosoever will, may take hold of God\u2019s strength, and make peace\nwith Him, and He will make peace.\nThe souls that turn to Him for refuge, Jesus lifts above the\naccusing and the strife of tongues. No man or evil angel can impeach\nHealing of the Soul 53\nthese souls. Christ unites them to His own divine-human nature.\nThey stand beside the great Sin Bearer in the light proceeding from\nthe throne of God.\nThe blood of Jesus Christ cleanses \u201cfrom all sin.\u201d 1 John 1:7.\n\u201cWho shall lay anything to the charge of God\u2019s elect? It is God\nthat justifieth. Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea\nrather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who\nalso maketh intercession for us.\u201d Romans 8:33, 34.\nOver the winds and the waves, and over men possessed of [91]\ndemons, Christ showed that He had absolute control. He who stilled\nthe tempest and calmed the troubled sea spoke peace to minds dis-\ntracted and overborne by Satan.\nIn the synagogue at Capernaum, Jesus was speaking of His\nmission to set free the slaves of sin. He was interrupted by a shriek\nof terror. A madman rushed forward from among the people, crying\nout, \u201cLet us alone; what have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of\nNazareth? art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art,\nthe Holy One of God.\u201d Mark 1:24.\nJesus rebuked the demon, saying, \u201cHold thy peace, and come\nout of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he\ncame out of him, and hurt him not.\u201d Luke 4:35.\nThe cause of this man\u2019s affliction also was in his own life. He\nhad been fascinated with the pleasures of sin and had thought to\nmake life a grand carnival. Intemperance and frivolity perverted the\nnoble attributes of his nature, and Satan took entire control of him.\nRemorse came too late. When he would have sacrificed wealth and\npleasure to regain his lost manhood he had become helpless in the\ngrasp of the evil one.\nIn the Saviour\u2019s presence he was roused to long for freedom, but\nthe demon resisted the power of Christ. When the man tried to appeal\nto Jesus for help, the evil spirit put words into his mouth, and he\ncried out in an agony of fear. The demoniac partially comprehended\nthat he was in the presence of One who could set him free; but when\nhe tried to come within reach of that mighty hand, another\u2019s will\nheld him, another\u2019s words found utterance through him.\nThe conflict between the power of Satan and his own desire for [92]\nfreedom was terrible. It seemed that the tortured man must lose\nhis life in the struggle with the foe that had been the ruin of his\n54 The Ministry of Healing\nmanhood. But the Saviour spoke with authority and set the captive\nfree. The man who had been possessed stood before the wondering\npeople in the freedom of self-possession.\nWith glad voice he praised God for deliverance. The eye that\nhad so lately glared with the fire of insanity now beamed with intel-\nligence and overflowed with grateful tears. The people were dumb\nwith amazement. As soon as they recovered speech they exclaimed\none to another, \u201cWhat is this? a new teaching! with authority He\ncommandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.\u201d Mark",

      "text": "There are multitudes today as truly under the power of evil spirits\nas was the demoniac of Capernaum. All who willfully depart from\nGod\u2019s commandments are placing themselves under the control of\nSatan. Many a man tampers with evil, thinking that he can break[93]\naway at pleasure; but he is lured on and on, until he finds himself\ncontrolled by a will stronger than his own. He cannot escape its\nmysterious power. Secret sin or master passion may hold him a\ncaptive as helpless as was the demoniac of Capernaum.\nYet his condition is not hopeless. God does not control our minds\nwithout our consent; but every man is free to choose what power\nhe will have to rule over him. None have fallen so low, none are so\nvile, but that they may find deliverance in Christ. The demoniac, in\nplace of prayer, could utter only the words of Satan; yet the heart\u2019s\nunspoken appeal was heard. No cry from a soul in need, though it\nfail of utterance in words, will be unheeded. Those who consent to\nenter into covenant with God are not left to the power of Satan or to\nthe infirmity of their own nature.\n\u201cShall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive\ndelivered? ... Thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty\nshall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered:\nfor I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save\nthy children.\u201d Isaiah 49:24, 25.\nMarvelous will be the transformation wrought in him who by\nfaith opens the door of the heart to the Saviour.\nHealing of the Soul 55\n\u201cI Give Unto You Power\u201d [94]\nLike the twelve apostles, the seventy disciples whom Christ\nsent forth later received supernatural endowments as a seal of their\nmission. When their work was completed, they returned with joy,\nsaying, \u201cLord, even the devils are subject unto us through Thy name.\u201d\nJesus answered, \u201cI beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.\u201d Luke\n10:17, 18.\nHenceforth Christ\u2019s followers are to look upon Satan as a con-\nquered foe. Upon the cross, Jesus was to gain the victory for them;\nthat victory He desired them to accept as their own. \u201cBehold,\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cI give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and\nover all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means\nhurt you.\u201d Verse 19.\nThe omnipotent power of the Holy Spirit is the defense of every\ncontrite soul. No one who in penitence and faith has claimed His\nprotection will Christ permit to pass under the enemy\u2019s power. It\nis true that Satan is a powerful being; but, thank God, we have a\nmighty Saviour, who cast out the evil one from heaven. Satan is\npleased when we magnify his power. Why not talk of Jesus? Why\nnot magnify His power and His love?\nThe rainbow of promise encircling the throne on high is an\neverlasting testimony that \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. It testifies to the\nuniverse that God will never forsake His children in the struggle\nwith evil. It is an assurance to us of strength and protection as long\nas the throne itself shall endure.\nChapter 6\u2014Saved to Serve[95]\nIt is morning on the Sea of Galilee. Jesus and His disciples have\ncome to shore after a tempestuous night on the water, and the light\nof the rising sun touches sea and land as with the benediction of\npeace. But as they step upon the beach they are greeted with a sight\nmore terrible than the storm-tossed sea. From some hiding place\namong the tombs two madmen rush upon them as if to tear them\nin pieces. Hanging about these men are parts of chains which they\nhave broken in escaping from confinement. Their flesh is torn and\nbleeding, their eyes glare out from their long and matted hair, the\nvery likeness of humanity seems to have been blotted out. They look\nmore like wild beasts than like men.\nThe disciples and their companions flee in terror; but presently\nthey notice that Jesus is not with them, and they turn to look for Him.\nHe is standing where they left Him. He who stilled the tempest, who\nhas before met Satan and conquered him, does not flee before these\ndemons. When the men, gnashing their teeth and foaming at the\nmouth, approach Him, Jesus raises that hand which has beckoned\nthe waves to rest, and the men can come no nearer. They stand[96]\nbefore Him, raging but helpless.\nWith authority He bids the unclean spirits come out of them. The\nunfortunate men realize that One is near who can save them from\nthe tormenting demons. They fall at the Saviour\u2019s feet to entreat His\nmercy; but when their lips are opened, the demons speak through\nthem, crying, \u201cWhat have we to do with Thee, Jesus, Thou Son of\nGod? art Thou come hither to torment us?\u201d Matthew 8:29.\nThe evil spirits are forced to release their victims, and a won-[97]\nderful change comes over the demoniacs. Light shines into their\nminds. Their eyes beam with intelligence. The countenances so\nlong deformed into the image of Satan become suddenly mild, the\nbloodstained hands are quiet, and the men lift their voices in praise\nto God.\n56\nSaved to Serve 57\nMeanwhile the demons, cast out from their human habitation,\nhave entered into the swine and driven them to destruction. The\nkeepers of the swine hurry away to publish the news, and the whole\npopulation flock to meet Jesus. The two demoniacs have been\nthe terror of the country. Now these men are clothed and in their\nright mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus, listening to His words, and\nglorifying the name of Him who has made them whole. But those\nwho behold this wonderful scene do not rejoice. The loss of the\nswine seems to them of greater moment than the deliverance of these\ncaptives of Satan. In terror they throng about Jesus, beseeching Him\nto depart from them, and He complies, taking ship at once for the\nopposite shore.\nFar different is the feeling of the restored demoniacs. They [98]\ndesire the companionship of their Deliverer. In His presence they\nfeel secure from the demons that have tormented their lives and\nwasted their manhood. As Jesus is about to enter the boat they keep\nclose to His side, kneel at His feet, and beg to remain near Him,\nwhere they may listen to His words. But Jesus bids them go home\nand tell what great things the Lord has done for them.\nHere is a work for them to do\u2014to go to a heathen home and tell\nof the blessings they have received from Jesus. It is hard for them to\nbe separated from the Saviour. Great difficulties will beset them in\nassociation with their heathen countrymen. And their long isolation\nfrom society seems to have disqualified them for this work. But as\nsoon as He points out their duty, they are ready to obey.\nNot only did they tell their own households and neighbors about\nJesus, but they went throughout Decapolis, everywhere declaring\nHis power to save and describing how He had freed them from the\ndemons.\nThough the people of Gergesa had not received Jesus, He did\nnot leave them to the darkness they had chosen. When they bade\nHim depart from them, they had not heard His words. They were\nignorant of that which they were rejecting. Therefore He sent the\nlight to them, and by those to whom they would not refuse to listen.\nIn causing the destruction of the swine, it was Satan\u2019s purpose\nto turn the people away from the Saviour and prevent the preaching\nof the gospel in that region. But this very occurrence roused the\ncountry as nothing else could have done, and directed attention to\n58 The Ministry of Healing\nChrist. Though the Saviour Himself departed, the men whom He\nhad healed remained as witnesses to His power. Those who had\nbeen mediums of the prince of darkness became channels of light,[99]\nmessengers of the Son of God. When Jesus returned to Decapolis,\nthe people flocked about Him, and for three days thousands from all\nthe surrounding country heard the message of salvation.\nThe two restored demoniacs were the first missionaries whom\nChrist sent to teach the gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a short\ntime only, these men had listened to His words. Not one sermon\nfrom His lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could not instruct\nthe people as the disciples who had been daily with Christ were able\nto do. But they could tell what they knew; what they themselves\nhad seen, and heard, and felt of the Saviour\u2019s power. This is what\neveryone can do whose heart has been touched by the grace of God.\nThis is the witness for which our Lord calls, and for want of which\nthe world is perishing.\nThe gospel is to be presented, not as a lifeless theory, but as\na living force to change the life. God would have His servants\nbear testimony to the fact that through His grace men may possess\nChristlikeness of character and may rejoice in the assurance of His\ngreat love. He would have us bear testimony to the fact that He\ncannot be satisfied until all who will accept salvation are reclaimed\nand reinstated in their holy privileges as His sons and daughters.\nEven those whose course has been most offensive to Him He\nfreely accepts. When they repent, He imparts to them His divine\nSpirit, and sends them forth into the camp of the disloyal to proclaim\nHis mercy. Souls that have been degraded into instruments of Satan\nare still, through the power of Christ, transformed into messengers\nof righteousness and are sent forth to tell how great things the Lord\nhath done for them and hath had compassion on them.\n\u201cMy Praise Shall Be Continually of Thee\u201d[100]\nAfter the woman of Capernaum had been healed by the touch of\nfaith, Jesus desired her to acknowledge the blessing she had received.\nThe gifts which the gospel offers are not to be secured by stealth or\nenjoyed in secret.\nSaved to Serve 59\n\u201cYe are My witnesses, saith the Lord,\nThat I am God.\u201d\nIsaiah 43:12.\nOur confession of His faithfulness is Heaven\u2019s chosen agency\nfor revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace\nas made known through the holy men of old; but that which will\nbe most effectual is the testimony of our own experience. We are\nwitnesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the working of a power\nthat is divine. Every individual has a life distinct from all others,\nand an experience differing essentially from theirs. God desires that\nour praise shall ascend to Him, marked with our own individuality.\nThese precious acknowledgments to the praise of the glory of His\ngrace, when supported by a Christlike life, have an irresistible power\nthat works for the salvation of souls.\nIt is for our own benefit to keep every gift of God fresh in our\nmemory. By this means faith is strengthened to claim and to receive\nmore and more. There is greater encouragement for us in the least\nblessing we ourselves receive from God than in all the accounts we\ncan read of the faith and experience of others. The soul that responds\nto the grace of God shall be like a watered garden. His health shall\nspring forth speedily; his light shall rise in obscurity, and the glory\nof the Lord shall be seen upon him.\n\u201cWhat shall I render unto the Lord [101]\nFor all His benefits toward me?\nI will take the cup of salvation,\nAnd call upon the name of the Lord.\nI will pay my vows unto the Lord,\nYea, in the presence of all His people.\u201d\n\u201cI will sing unto the Lord as long as I live:\nI will sing praise to my God while I have my being.\nMy meditation of Him shall be sweet:\nI will be glad in the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cWho can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?\nWho can show forth all His praise?\u201d\n60 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cCall upon His name;\nMake known among the peoples His doings.\nSing unto Him, sing praises unto Him:\u201d\n\u201cTalk ye of all His wondrous works.\nGlory ye in His holy name:\nLet the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cBecause Thy loving-kindness is better than life,\nMy lips shall praise Thee....\nMy soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness;\nAnd my mouth shall praise Thee with joyful lips;\nWhen I remember Thee upon my bed,\nAnd meditate on Thee in the night watches.\nFor Thou hast been my help,\nAnd in the shadow of Thy wings will I rejoice.\u201d\n\u201cIn God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid;\nWhat can man do unto me?\nThy vows are upon me, O God:\nI will render thank offerings unto Thee.\nFor Thou hast delivered my soul from death:\nHast Thou not delivered my feet from falling,\nThat I may walk before God in the light of the living?\u201d\n\u201cO Thou Holy One of Israel.\nMy lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto Thee;\nAnd my soul, which Thou hast redeemed.\nMy tongue also shall talk of Thy righteousness all the day\nlong.\u201d\n\u201cThou art my trust from my youth.... [102]\nMy praise shall be continually of Thee.\u201d\nSaved to Serve 61\n\u201cI will make Thy name to be remembered:...\nTherefore shall the people praise Thee.\u201d\nPsalm 116:12-14, R.V .;\n104:33, 34; 106:2;",

The message is to be given to all. When God blesses His\nchildren, it is not alone for their own sake, but for the world\u2019s sake.\nAs He bestows His gifts on us, it is that we may multiply them by\nimparting.\nThe Samaritan woman who talked with Jesus at Jacob\u2019s well had\nno sooner found the Saviour than she brought others to Him. She\nproved herself a more effective missionary than His own disciples.\nThe disciples saw nothing in Samaria to indicate that it was an\nencouraging field. Their thoughts were fixed upon a great work to\nbe done in the future. They did not see that right around them was a\nharvest to be gathered. But through the woman whom they despised\na whole cityful were brought to hear Jesus. She carried the light at\nonce to her countrymen.\nThis woman represents the working of a practical faith in Christ.\nEvery true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.\nNo sooner does he come to know the Saviour than he desires to make\nothers acquainted with Him. The saving and sanctifying truth cannot\nbe shut up in his heart. He who drinks of the living water becomes a\nfountain of life. The receiver becomes a giver. The grace of Christ\nin the soul is like a spring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and\nmaking those who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water [103]\nof life. In doing this work a greater blessing is received than if we\nwork merely to benefit ourselves. It is in working to spread the good\nnews of salvation that we are brought near to the Saviour.\nOf those who receive His grace the Lord says:\n62 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cI will make them and the places round about My hill a blessing;\nand I will cause the shower to come down in its season; there shall\nbe showers of blessing.\u201d Ezekiel 34:26, A.R.V .\n\u201cOn the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,\nsaying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink. He that\nbelieveth on Me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall\nflow rivers of living water.\u201d John 7:37, 38, A.R.V .\nThose who receive are to impart to others. From every direction\nare coming calls for help. God calls upon men to minister gladly to\ntheir fellow men. Immortal crowns are to be won; the kingdom of\nheaven is to be gained; the world, perishing in ignorance, is to be\nenlightened.\n\u201cSay not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?\nbehold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields;\nfor they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth receiveth\nwages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal.\u201d John 4:35, 36.\nFor three years the disciples had before them the wonderful[104]\nexample of Jesus. Day by day they walked and talked with Him,\nhearing His words of cheer to the weary and heavy-laden, and seeing\nthe manifestations of His power in behalf of the sick and afflicted.\nWhen the time came for Him to leave them, He gave them grace and\npower to carry forward His work in His name. They were to shed\nabroad the light of His gospel of love and healing. And the Saviour\npromised that His presence would be always with them. Through the\nHoly Spirit He would be even nearer to them than when He walked\nvisibly among men.\nThe work which the disciples did, we also are to do. Every\nChristian is to be a missionary. In sympathy and compassion we\nare to minister to those in need of help, seeking with unselfish\nearnestness to lighten the woes of suffering humanity.\nAll may find something to do. None need feel that there is no\nplace where they can labor for Christ. The Saviour identifies Himself\nwith every child of humanity. That we might become members of\nthe heavenly family, He became a member of the earthly family. He\nis the Son of man, and thus a brother to every son and daughter of\nAdam. His followers are not to feel themselves detached from the\nperishing world around them. They are a part of the great web of\nSaved to Serve 63\nhumanity, and heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as well\nas to saints.\nMillions upon millions of human beings, in sickness and igno-\nrance and sin, have never so much as heard of Christ\u2019s love for them.\nWere our condition and theirs to be reversed, what would we desire\nthem to do for us? All this, so far as lies in our power, we are to do\nfor them. Christ\u2019s rule of life by which every one of us must stand\nor fall in the judgment is, \u201cWhatsoever ye would that men should do [105]\nto you, do ye even so to them.\u201d Matthew 7:12.\nBy all that has given us advantage over another,\u2014be it education\nand refinement, nobility of character, Christian training, religious\nexperience,\u2014we are in debt to those less favored; and, so far as lies\nin our power, we are to minister unto them. If we are strong, we are\nto stay up the hands of the weak.\nAngels of glory that do always behold the face of the Father in\nheaven, joy in ministering to His little ones. Angels are ever present\nwhere they are most needed, with those who have the hardest battles\nwith self to fight, and whose surroundings are the most discouraging.\nWeak and trembling souls who have many objectionable traits of\ncharacter are their special charge. That which selfish hearts would\nregard as humiliating service, ministering to those who are wretched\nand in every way inferior in character, is the work of the pure, sinless\nbeings from the courts above.\nJesus did not consider heaven a place to be desired while we\nwere lost. He left the heavenly courts for a life of reproach and\ninsult, and a death of shame. He who was rich in heaven\u2019s priceless\ntreasure became poor, that through His poverty we might be rich.\nWe are to follow in the path He trod.\nHe who becomes a child of God should henceforth look upon\nhimself as a link in the chain let down to save the world, one with\nChrist in His plan of mercy, going forth with Him to seek and save\nthe lost.\nMany feel that it would be a great privilege to visit the scenes\nof Christ\u2019s life on earth, to walk where He trod, to look upon the\nlake beside which He loved to teach, and the hills and valleys on\nwhich His eyes so often rested. But we need not go to Nazareth, to [106]\nCapernaum, or to Bethany, in order to walk in the steps of Jesus. We\nshall find His footprints beside the sickbed, in the hovels of poverty,\n64 The Ministry of Healing\nin the crowded alleys of the great cities, and in every place where\nthere are human hearts in need of consolation.\nWe are to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the\nsuffering and afflicted. We are to minister to the despairing, and to\ninspire hope in the hopeless.\nThe love of Christ, manifested in unselfish ministry, will be more\neffective in reforming the evildoer than will the sword or the court\nof justice. These are necessary to strike terror to the lawbreaker, but\nthe loving missionary can do more than this. Often the heart that\nhardens under reproof will melt under the love of Christ.\nThe missionary can not only relieve physical maladies, but he\ncan lead the sinner to the Great Physician, who can cleanse the soul\nfrom the leprosy of sin. Through His servants, God designs that\nthe sick, the unfortunate, and those possessed of evil spirits shall\nhear His voice. Through His human agencies He desires to be a\ncomforter such as the world knows not.\nThe Saviour has given His precious life in order to establish a\nchurch capable of ministering to the suffering, the sorrowful, and\nthe tempted. A company of believers may be poor, uneducated, and\nunknown; yet in Christ they may do a work in the home, in the\ncommunity, and even in \u201cthe regions beyond,\u201d whose results shall\nbe as far-reaching as eternity.\nTo Christ\u2019s followers today, no less than to the first disciples,\nthese words are spoken:\n\u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go ye\ntherefore, and teach all nations.\u201d \u201cGo ye into all the world, and\npreach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Matthew 28:18, 19; Mark\n16:15.\nAnd for us also is the promise of His presence, \u201cLo, I am with[107]\nyou alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:20.\nToday no curious multitudes flock to the desert places to see\nand hear the Christ. His voice is not heard in the busy streets. No\ncry sounds from the wayside, \u201cJesus of Nazareth passeth by.\u201d Luke\n18:37. Yet this word is true today. Christ walks unseen through our\nstreets. With messages of mercy He comes to our homes. With all\nwho are seeking to minister in His name, He waits to co-operate. He\nis in the midst of us, to heal and to bless, if we will receive Him.\nSaved to Serve 65\n\u201cThus saith Jehovah, In an acceptable time have I answered thee,\nand in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee,\nand give thee for a covenant of the people, to raise up the land, to\nmake them inherit the desolate heritages; saying to them that are\nbound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cHow beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that\nbringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace;\nThat bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation;\nThat saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!\u201d\nIsaiah 49:8, 9, A.R.V .; 52:7.\n\u201cBreak forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places:...\nFor the Lord hath comforted His people....\nThe Lord hath made bare His holy arm\nIn the eyes of all the nations;\nAnd all the ends of the earth\nShall see the salvation of our God.\u201d\nVerses 9, 10.\n66 The Ministry of Healing\nThe Work of the Physician [108]\n[109]\n[110]\n\u201cI have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done. \u201d\nChapter 7\u2014The Co-Working of the Divine and the\nHuman[111]\nIn the ministry of healing the physician is to be a co-worker\nwith Christ. The Saviour ministered to both the soul and the body.\nThe gospel which He taught was a message of spiritual life and\nof physical restoration. Deliverance from sin and the healing of\ndisease were linked together. The same ministry is committed to\nthe Christian physician. He is to unite with Christ in relieving both\nthe physical and spiritual needs of his fellow men. He is to be to\nthe sick a messenger of mercy, bringing to them a remedy for the\ndiseased body and for the sin-sick soul.\nChrist is the true head of the medical profession. The chief\nPhysician, He is at the side of every God-fearing practitioner who\nworks to relieve human suffering. While the physician uses nature\u2019s\nremedies for physical disease, he should point his patients to Him\nwho can relieve the maladies of both the soul and the body. That\nwhich physicians can only aid in doing, Christ accomplishes. They\nendeavor to assist nature\u2019s work of healing; Christ Himself is the\nhealer. The physician seeks to preserve life; Christ imparts life.\nThe Source of Healing[112]\nThe Saviour in His miracles revealed the power that is continu-\nally at work in man\u2019s behalf, to sustain and to heal him. Through\nthe agencies of nature, God is working, day by day, hour by hour,\nmoment by moment, to keep us alive, to build up and restore us.\nWhen any part of the body sustains injury, a healing process is at\nonce begun; nature\u2019s agencies are set at work to restore soundness.\nBut the power working through these agencies is the power of God.[113]\nAll life-giving power is from Him. When one recovers from disease,\nit is God who restores him.\nSickness, suffering, and death are work of an antagonistic power.\nSatan is the destroyer; God is the restorer.\n68\nCo-Working of the Divine and the Human 69\nThe words spoken to Israel are true today of those who recover\nhealth of body or health of soul. \u201cI am the Lord that healeth thee.\u201d\nExodus 15:26.\nThe desire of God for every human being is expressed in the\nwords, \u201cBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper\nand be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\u201d 3 John 2.\nHe it is who \u201cforgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy\ndiseases; who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth\nthee with loving-kindness and tender mercies.\u201d Psalm 103:3, 4.\nWhen Christ healed disease, He warned many of the afflicted\nones, \u201cSin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.\u201d John 5:14.\nThus He taught that they had brought disease upon themselves by\ntransgressing the laws of God, and that health could be preserved\nonly by obedience.\nThe physician should teach his patients that they are to cooperate\nwith God in the work of restoration. The physician has a continually\nincreasing realization of the fact that disease is the result of sin.\nHe knows that the laws of nature, as truly as the precepts of the\nDecalogue, are divine, and that only in obedience to them can health\nbe recovered or preserved. He sees many suffering as the result of\nhurtful practices who might be restored to health if they would do\nwhat they might for their own restoration. They need to be taught\nthat every practice which destroys the physical, mental, or spiritual\nenergies is sin, and that health is to be secured through obedience to\nthe laws that God has established for the good of all mankind.\nWhen a physician sees a patient suffering from disease caused [114]\nby improper eating and drinking or other wrong habits, yet neglects\nto tell him of this, he is doing his fellow being an injury. Drunkards,\nmaniacs, those who are given over to licentiousness, all appeal to the\nphysician to declare clearly and distinctly that suffering results from\nsin. Those who understand the principles of life should be in earnest\nin striving to counteract the causes of disease. Seeing the continual\nconflict with pain, laboring constantly to alleviate suffering, how\ncan the physician hold his peace? Is he benevolent and merciful if\nhe does not teach strict temperance as a remedy for disease?\nLet it be made plain that the way of God\u2019s commandments is the\nway of life. God has established the laws of nature, but His laws are\nnot arbitrary exactions. Every \u201cThou shalt not,\u201d whether in physical\n70 The Ministry of Healing\nor in moral law, implies a promise. If we obey it, blessing will attend\nour steps. God never forces us to do right, but He seeks to save us\nfrom the evil and lead us to the good.\nLet attention be called to the laws that were taught to Israel. God\ngave them definite instruction in regard to their habits of life. He\nmade known to them the laws relating to both physical and spiritual\nwell-being; and on condition of obedience He assured them, \u201cThe\nLord will take away from thee all sickness.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:15.\n\u201cSet your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this\nday.\u201d \u201cFor they are life unto those that find them, and health to all\ntheir flesh.\u201d Deuteronomy 32:46; Proverbs 4:22.\nGod desires us to reach the standard of perfection made possible\nfor us by the gift of Christ. He calls upon us to make our choice on\nthe right side, to connect with heavenly agencies, to adopt principles\nthat will restore in us the divine image. In His written word and[115]\nin the great book of nature He has revealed the principles of life.\nIt is our work to obtain a knowledge of these principles, and by\nobedience to co-operate with Him in restoring health to the body as\nwell as to the soul.\nMen need to learn that the blessings of obedience, in their full-\nness, can be theirs only as they receive the grace of Christ. It is\nHis grace that gives man power to obey the laws of God. It is this\nthat enables him to break the bondage of evil habit. This is the only\npower that can make him and keep him steadfast in the right path.\nWhen the gospel is received in its purity and power, it is a cure\nfor the maladies that originated in sin. The Sun of Righteousness\narises, \u201cwith healing in His wings.\u201d Malachi 4:2. Not all this world\nbestows can heal a broken heart, or impart peace of mind, or remove\ncare, or banish disease. Fame, genius, talent\u2014all are powerless to\ngladden the sorrowful heart or to restore the wasted life. The life of\nGod in the soul is man\u2019s only hope.\nThe love which Christ diffuses through the whole being is a\nvitalizing power. Every vital part\u2014the brain, the heart, the nerves\u2014\nit touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the being are\nroused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and sorrow, the\nanxiety and care, that crush the life forces. With it come serenity\nand composure. It implants in the soul, joy that nothing earthly can\ndestroy,\u2014joy in the Holy Spirit,\u2014health-giving, life-giving joy.\nCo-Working of the Divine and the Human 71\nOur Saviour\u2019s words, \u201cCome unto Me, ... and I will give you\nrest\u201d (Matthew 11:28), are a prescription for the healing of physical,\nmental, and spiritual ills. Though men have brought suffering upon\nthemselves by their own wrongdoing, He regards them with pity. In\nHim they may find help. He will do great things for those who trust\nin Him.\nAlthough for ages sin has been strengthening its hold on the [116]\nhuman race, although through falsehood and artifice Satan has cast\nthe black shadow of his interpretation upon the word of God, and has\ncaused men to doubt His goodness; yet the Father\u2019s mercy and love\nhave not ceased to flow earthward in rich currents. If human beings\nwould open the windows of the soul heavenward, in appreciation of\nthe divine gifts, a flood of healing virtue would pour in.\nThe physician who desires to be an acceptable co-worker with\nChrist will strive to become efficient in every feature of his work.\nHe will study diligently, that he may be well qualified for the respon-\nsibilities of his profession, and will constantly endeavor to reach\na higher standard, seeking for increased knowledge, greater skill,\nand deeper discernment. Every physician should realize that he who\ndoes weak, inefficient work is not only doing injury to the sick,\nbut is also doing injustice to his fellow physicians. The physician\nwho is satisfied with a low standard of skill and knowledge not only\nbelittles the medical profession, but does dishonor to Christ, the\nChief Physician.\nThose who find that they are unfitted for medical work should\nchoose some other employment. Those who are well adapted to\ncare for the sick, but whose education and medical qualifications\nare limited, would do well to take up the humbler parts of the work,\nministering faithfully as nurses. By patient service under skillful\nphysicians they may be constantly learning, and by improving every\nopportunity to acquire knowledge they may in time become fully\nqualified for the work of a physician. Let the younger physicians,\n\u201cas workers together with Him [the Chief Physician], ... receive not\nthe grace of God in vain, ... giving no offense in anything, that the\nministry [of the sick] be not blamed: but in all things approving\nourselves as the ministers of God.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:1-4.\nGod\u2019s purpose for us is that we shall ever move upward. The [117]\ntrue medical missionary physician will be an increasingly skillful\n72 The Ministry of Healing\npractitioner. Talented Christian physicians, having superior profes-\nsional ability, should be sought out and encouraged to engage in the\nservice of God in places where they can educate and train others to\nbecome medical missionaries.\nThe Physician should gather to his soul the light of the word\nof God. He should make continual growth in grace. With him,\nreligion is not to be merely one influence among others. It is to\nbe an influence dominating all others. He is to act from high, holy\nmotives\u2014motives that are powerful because they proceed from the\nOne who gave His life to furnish us with power to overcome evil.\nIf the physician faithfully and diligently strives to make himself\nefficient in his profession, if he consecrates himself to the service of\nChrist, and takes time to search his own heart, he will understand\nhow to grasp the mysteries of his sacred calling. He may so discipline\nand educate himself that all within the sphere of his influence will\nsee the excellence of the education and wisdom gained by the one\nwho is connected with the God of wisdom and power.\nIn no place is a closer fellowship with Christ needed than in the\nwork of the physician. He who would rightly perform the physician\u2019s\nduties must daily and hourly live a Christian life. The life of the\npatient is in the hands of the physician. One careless diagnosis, one\nwrong prescription, in a critical case, or one unskillful movement of\nthe hand in an operation, even by so much as a hair\u2019s breadth, and\na life may be sacrificed, a soul launched into eternity. How solemn\nthe thought! How important that the physician shall be ever under\nthe control of the divine Physician!\nThe Saviour is willing to help all who call upon Him for wisdom[118]\nand clearness of thought. And who needs wisdom and clearness\nof thought more than does the physician, upon whose decisions so\nmuch depends? Let the one who is trying to prolong life look in\nfaith to Christ to direct his every movement. The Saviour will give\nhim tact and skill in dealing with difficult cases.\nWonderful are the opportunities given to the guardians of the\nsick. In all that is done for the restoration of the sick, let them\nunderstand that the physician is seeking to help them co-operate\nwith God in combating disease. Lead them to feel that at every step\ntaken in harmony with the laws of God, they may expect the aid of\ndivine power.\nCo-Working of the Divine and the Human 73\nThe sick and suffering will have much more confidence in the\nphysician who they are confident loves and fears God. They rely\nupon his words. They feel a sense of safety in the presence and\nadministration of that physician.\nKnowing the Lord Jesus, it is the privilege of the Christian\npractitioner by prayer to invite His presence in the sickroom. Before\nperforming a critical operation, let the physician ask for the aid of\nthe Great Physician. Let him assure the suffering one that God can\nbring him safely through the ordeal, that in all times of distress He is\na sure refuge for those who trust in Him. The physician who cannot\ndo this loses case after case that otherwise might have been saved.\nIf he could speak words that would inspire faith in the sympathizing\nSaviour, who feels every throb of anguish, and could present the\nneeds of the soul to Him in prayer, the crisis would oftener be safely\npassed.\nOnly He who reads the heart can know with what trembling and\nterror many patients consent to an operation under the surgeon\u2019s\nhand. They realize their peril. While they may have confidence in\nthe physician\u2019s skill they know that it is not infallible. But as they [119]\nsee the physician bowed in prayer, asking help from God, they are\ninspired with confidence. Gratitude and trust open the heart to the\nhealing power of God, the energies of the whole being are vitalized,\nand the life forces triumph.\nTo the physician also the Saviour\u2019s presence is an element of\nstrength. Often the responsibilities and possibilities of his work\nbring dread upon the spirit. The feverishness of uncertainty and fear\nwould make the hand unskillful. But the assurance that the divine\nCounselor is beside him, to guide and to sustain, imparts quietness\nand courage. The touch of Christ upon the physician\u2019s hand brings\nvitality, restfulness, confidence, and power.\nWhen the crisis is safely passed, and success is apparent, let a\nfew moments be spent with the patient in prayer. Give expression\nto your thankfulness for the life that has been spared. As words of\ngratitude flow from the patient to the physician, let the praise and\nthanksgiving be directed to God. Tell the patient his life has been\nspared because he was under the heavenly Physician\u2019s protection.\n74 The Ministry of Healing\nThe physician who follows such a course is leading his patient\nto the One upon whom he is dependent for life, the One who can\nsave to the uttermost all who come to Him.\nInto the medical missionary work should be brought a deep\nyearning for souls. To the physician equally with the gospel minister\nis committed the highest trust ever committed to man. Whether he\nrealizes it or not, every physician is entrusted with the cure of souls.\nIn their work of dealing with disease and death, physicians too\noften lose sight of the solemn realities of the future life. In their\nearnest effort to avert the peril of the body, they forget the peril of\nthe soul. The one to whom they are ministering may be losing his[120]\nhold on life. Its last opportunities are slipping from his grasp. This\nsoul the physician must meet again at the judgment seat of Christ.\nOften we miss the most precious blessings by neglecting to speak\na word in season. If the golden opportunity is not watched for, it will\nbe lost. At the bedside of the sick no word of creed or controversy\nshould be spoken. Let the sufferer be pointed to the One who is\nwilling to save all that come to Him in faith. Earnestly, tenderly\nstrive to help the soul that is hovering between life and death.\nThe physician who knows that Christ is his personal Saviour,\nbecause he himself has been led to the Refuge, knows how to deal\nwith the trembling, guilty, sin-sick souls who turn to him for help.\nHe can respond to the inquiry, \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?\u201d He can\ntell the story of the Redeemer\u2019s love. He can speak from experience\nof the power of repentance and faith. In simple, earnest words he[121]\ncan present the soul\u2019s need to God in prayer and can encourage the\nsick one also to ask for and accept the mercy of the compassionate\nSaviour. As he thus ministers at the bedside of the sick, striving to\nspeak words that will bring help and comfort, the Lord works with\nhim and through him. As the mind of the sufferer is directed to the\nSaviour, the peace of Christ fills his heart, and the spiritual health\nthat comes to him is used as the helping hand of God in restoring\nthe health of the body.\nIn attending the sick, the physician will often find opportunity\nfor ministering to the friends of the afflicted one. As they watch\nby the bed of suffering, feeling powerless to prevent one pang of\nanguish, their hearts are softened. Often grief concealed from others\nis expressed to the physician. Then is the opportunity to point these\nCo-Working of the Divine and the Human 75\nsorrowing ones to Him who has invited the weary and heavy-laden\nto come unto Him. Often prayer can be offered for and with them,\npresenting their needs to the Healer of all woes, the Soother of all\nsorrows.\nGod\u2019s Promises\nThe physician has precious opportunities for directing his pa-\ntients to the promises of God\u2019s word. He is to bring from the treasure\nhouse things new and old, speaking here and there the words of com-\nfort and instruction that are longed for. Let the physician make his\nmind a storehouse of fresh thoughts. Let him study the word of God\ndiligently, that he may be familiar with its promises. Let him learn\nto repeat the comforting words that Christ spoke during His earthly\nministry when giving His lessons and healing the sick. He should\ntalk of the works of healing wrought by Christ, of His tenderness\nand love. Never should he neglect to direct the minds of his patients\nto Christ, the Chief Physician.\nThe same power that Christ exercised when He walked visibly [122]\namong men is in His word. It was by His word that Jesus healed\ndisease and cast out demons; by His word He stilled the sea and\nraised the dead, and the people bore witness that His word was with\npower. He spoke the word of God, as He had spoken to all the\nprophets and teachers of the Old Testament. The whole Bible is a\nmanifestation of Christ.\nThe Scriptures are to be received as God\u2019s word to us, not written\nmerely, but spoken. When the afflicted ones came to Christ, He\nbeheld not only those who asked for help, but all who throughout\nthe ages should come to Him in like need and with like faith. When\nHe said to the paralytic, \u201cSon, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven\nthee;\u201d when He said to the woman of Capernaum, \u201cDaughter, be\nof good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace,\u201d He\nspoke to other afflicted, sin-burdened ones who should seek His help.\nMatthew 9:2; Luke 8:48.\nSo with all the promises of God\u2019s word. In them He is speaking\nto us individually, speaking as directly as if we could listen to His\nvoice. It is in these promises that Christ communicates to us His\ngrace and power. They are leaves from that tree which is \u201cfor the\n76 The Ministry of Healing\nhealing of the nations.\u201d Revelation 22:2. Received, assimilated, they\nare to be the strength of the character, the inspiration and sustenance\nof the life. Nothing else can have such healing power. Nothing\nbesides can impart the courage and faith which give vital energy to\nthe whole being.\nTo one who stands trembling with fear on the brink of the grave,\nto the soul weary of the burden of suffering and sin, let the physician\nas he has opportunity repeat the words of the Saviour\u2014for all the\nwords of Holy Writ are His:\n\u201cFear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy[123]\nname; thou art Mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will\nbe with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee:\nwhen thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither\nshall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the\nHoly One of Israel, thy Saviour.... Since thou wast precious in My\nsight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee.\u201d \u201cI, even I,\nam He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake, and\nwill not remember thy sins.\u201d \u201cFear not: for I am with thee.\u201d Isaiah\n43:1-4, 25, 5.\n\u201cLike as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them\nthat fear Him. For He knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we\nare dust.\u201d Psalm 103:13, 14.\n\u201cOnly acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed\nagainst the Lord thy God.\u201d \u201cIf we confess our sins, He is faithful and\njust to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteous-\nness.\u201d Jeremiah 3:13; 1 John 1:9.\n\u201cI have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a\ncloud, thy sins: return unto Me; for I have redeemed thee.\u201d Isaiah\n44:22.\n\u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though\nyour sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they\nbe red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and\nobedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.\u201d Isaiah 1:18, 19.\n\u201cI have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-\nkindness have I drawn thee.\u201d \u201cI hid My face from thee for a moment;\nbut with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee.\u201d Jeremiah\n31:3; Isaiah 54:8.\nCo-Working of the Divine and the Human 77\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled.\u201d \u201cPeace I leave with you, My\npeace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let [124]\nnot your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d John 14:1, 27.\n\u201cA man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert\nfrom the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of\na great rock in a weary land.\u201d Isaiah 32:2.\n\u201cWhen the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and\ntheir tongue faileth for thirst, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of\nIsrael will not forsake them.\u201d Isaiah 41:17.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord that made thee\u201d: \u201cI will pour water upon\nhim that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour My\nSpirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring.\u201d Isaiah\n44:2, 3.\n\u201cLook unto Me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.\u201d Isaiah\n45:22.\n\u201cHimself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.\u201d \u201cHe was\nwounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities:\nthe chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes\nwe are healed.\u201d Matthew 8:17; Isaiah 53:5.\nChapter 8\u2014The Physician, an Educator[125]\nThe true physician is an educator. He recognizes his responsi-\nbility, not only to the sick who are under his direct care, but also to\nthe community in which he lives. He stands as a guardian of both\nphysical and moral health. It is his endeavor not only to teach right\nmethods for the treatment of the sick, but to encourage right habits\nof living, and to spread a knowledge of right principles.\nNeed of Education in Health Principles\nEducation in health principles was never more needed than now.\nNotwithstanding the wonderful progress in so many lines relating to\nthe comforts and conveniences of life, even to sanitary matters and\nto the treatment of disease, the decline in physical vigor and power\nof endurance is alarming. It demands the attention of all who have\nat heart the well-being of their fellow men.\nOur artificial civilization is encouraging evils destructive of\nsound principles. Custom and fashion are at war with nature. The\npractices they enjoin, and the indulgences they foster, are steadily\nlessening both physical and mental strength, and bringing upon the[126]\nrace an intolerable burden. Intemperance and crime, disease and\nwretchedness, are everywhere.\nMany transgress the laws of health through ignorance, and they\nneed instruction. But the greater number know better than they do.\nThey need to be impressed with the importance of making their\nknowledge a guide of life. The physician has many opportunities\nboth of imparting a knowledge of health principles and of showing\nthe importance of putting them in practice. By right instruction he\ncan do much to correct evils that are working untold harm.\nA practice that is laying the foundation of a vast amount of\ndisease and of even more serious evils is the free use of poisonous\ndrugs. When attacked by disease, many will not take the trouble\nto search out the cause of their illness. Their chief anxiety is to\n78\nPhysician, an Educator 79\nrid themselves of pain and inconvenience. So they resort to patent\nnostrums, of whose real properties they know little, or they apply to a\nphysician for some remedy to counteract the result of their misdoing,\nbut with no thought of making a change in their unhealthful habits.\nIf immediate benefit is not realized, another medicine is tried, and\nthen another. Thus the evil continues.\nPeople need to be taught that drugs do not cure disease. It is true\nthat they sometimes afford present relief, and the patient appears to\nrecover as the result of their use; this is because nature has sufficient\nvital force to expel the poison and to correct the conditions that\ncaused the disease. Health is recovered in spite of the drug. But\nin most cases the drug only changes the form and location of the\ndisease. Often the effect of the poison seems to be overcome for a\ntime, but the results remain in the system and work great harm at\nsome later period.\nBy the use of poisonous drugs, many bring upon themselves\nlifelong illness, and many lives are lost that might be saved by the [127]\nuse of natural methods of healing. The poisons contained in many\nso-called remedies create habits and appetites that mean ruin to\nboth soul and body. Many of the popular nostrums called patent\nmedicines, and even some of the drugs dispensed by physicians, act\na part in laying the foundation of the liquor habit, the opium habit,\nthe morphine habit, that are so terrible a curse to society.\nThe only hope of better things is in the education of the people\nin right principles. Let physicians teach the people that restorative\npower is not in drugs, but in nature. Disease is an effort of nature to\nfree the system from conditions that result from a violation of the\nlaws of health. In case of sickness, the cause should be ascertained.\nUnhealthful conditions should be changed, wrong habits corrected.\nThen nature is to be assisted in her effort to expel impurities and to\nre-establish right conditions in the system.\nNatural Remedies\nPure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise, proper diet,\nthe use of water, trust in divine power\u2014these are the true remedies.\nEvery person should have a knowledge of nature\u2019s remedial agencies\nand how to apply them. It is essential both to understand the prin-\n80 The Ministry of Healing\nciples involved in the treatment of the sick and to have a practical\ntraining that will enable one rightly to use this knowledge.\nThe use of natural remedies requires an amount of care and\neffort that many are not willing to give. Nature\u2019s process of healing\nand upbuilding is gradual, and to the impatient it seems slow. The\nsurrender of hurtful indulgences requires sacrifice. But in the end it\nwill be found that nature, untrammeled, does her work wisely and\nwell. Those who persevere in obedience to her laws will reap the\nreward in health of body and health of mind.\nToo little attention is generally given to the preservation of[128]\nhealth. It is far better to prevent disease than to know how to treat\nit when contracted. It is the duty of every person, for his own sake,\nand for the sake of humanity, to inform himself in regard to the\nlaws of life and conscientiously to obey them. All need to become\nacquainted with that most wonderful of all organisms, the human\nbody. They should understand the functions of the various organs\nand the dependence of one upon another for the healthy action of all.\nThey should study the influence of the mind upon the body, and of\nthe body upon the mind, and the laws by which they are governed.\nTraining for Life\u2019s Conflict\nWe cannot be too often reminded that health does not depend\non chance. It is a result of obedience to law. This is recognized by\nthe contestants in athletic games and trials of strength. These men\nmake the most careful preparation. They submit to thorough training\nand strict discipline. Every physical habit is carefully regulated.\nThey know that neglect, excess, or carelessness, which weakens or\ncripples any organ or function of the body, would ensure defeat.\nHow much more important is such carefulness to ensure success\nin the conflict of life. It is not mimic battles in which we are engaged.\nWe are waging a warfare upon which hang eternal results. We have\nunseen enemies to meet. Evil angels are striving for the dominion\nof every human being. Whatever injures the health, not only lessens\nphysical vigor, but tends to weaken the mental and moral powers.\nIndulgence in any unhealthful practice makes it more difficult for one\nto discriminate between right and wrong, and hence more difficult\nto resist evil. It increases the danger of failure and defeat.\nPhysician, an Educator 81\n\u201cThey which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize.\u201d [129]\n1 Corinthians 9:24. In the warfare in which we are engaged, all\nmay win who will discipline themselves by obedience to right prin-\nciples. The practice of these principles in the details of life is too\noften looked upon as unimportant\u2014a matter too trivial to demand\nattention. But in view of the issues at stake, nothing with which we\nhave to do is small. Every act casts its weight into the scale that\ndetermines life\u2019s victory or defeat. The scripture bids us, \u201cSo run,\nthat ye may obtain.\u201d Verse 24.\nWith our first parents, intemperate desire resulted in the loss of\nEden. Temperance in all things has more to do with our restoration\nto Eden than men realize.\nPointing to the self-denial practiced by the contestants in the\nancient Greek games, the apostle Paul writes: \u201cEvery man that\nstriveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it\nto obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore\nso run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:\nbut I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by\nany means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a\ncastaway.\u201d Verses 25-27.\nThe progress of reform depends upon a clear recognition of\nfundamental truth. While, on the one hand, danger lurks in a narrow\nphilosophy and a hard, cold orthodoxy, on the other hand there is\ngreat danger in a careless liberalism. The foundation of all enduring\nreform is the law of God. We are to present in clear, distinct lines\nthe need of obeying this law. Its principles must be kept before the\npeople. They are as everlasting and inexorable as God Himself.\nOne of the most deplorable effects of the original apostasy was\nthe loss of man\u2019s power of self-control. Only as this power is re-\ngained can there be real progress.\nThe body is the only medium through which the mind and the [130]\nsoul are developed for the upbuilding of character. Hence it is\nthat the adversary of souls directs his temptations to the enfeebling\nand degrading of the physical powers. His success here means the\nsurrender to evil of the whole being. The tendencies of our physical\nnature, unless under the dominion of a higher power, will surely\nwork ruin and death.\n82 The Ministry of Healing\nThe body is to be brought into subjection. The higher powers of\nthe being are to rule. The passions are to be controlled by the will,\nwhich is itself to be under the control of God. The kingly power of\nreason, sanctified by divine grace, is to bear sway in our lives.\nThe requirements of God must be brought home to the con-\nscience. Men and women must be awakened to the duty of self-mas-\ntery, the need of purity, freedom from every depraving appetite and\ndefiling habit. They need to be impressed with the fact that all their\npowers of mind and body are the gift of God, and are to be preserved\nin the best possible condition for His service.\nIn that ancient ritual which was the gospel in symbol, no blem-\nished offering could be brought to God\u2019s altar. The sacrifice that was\nto represent Christ must be spotless. The word of God points to this\nas an illustration of what His children are to be\u2014\u201ca living sacrifice,\u201d\n\u201choly and without blemish,\u201d \u201cwell-pleasing to God.\u201d Romans 12:1,\nR.V ., margin; Ephesians 5:27.\nApart from divine power, no genuine reform can be effected.\nHuman barriers against natural and cultivated tendencies are but as\nthe sandbank against the torrent. Not until the life of Christ becomes\na vitalizing power in our lives can we resist the temptations that\nassail us from within and from without.\nChrist came to this world and lived the law of God, that man\nmight have perfect mastery over the natural inclinations which cor-\nrupt the soul. The Physician of soul and body, He gives victory over[131]\nwarring lusts. He has provided every facility, that man may possess\ncompleteness of character.\nWhen one surrenders to Christ, the mind is brought under the\ncontrol of the law; but it is the royal law, which proclaims liberty to\nevery captive. By becoming one with Christ, man is made free. Sub-\njection to the will of Christ means restoration to perfect manhood.\nObedience to God is liberty from the thralldom of sin, deliver-\nance from human passion and impulse. Man may stand conqueror\nof himself, conqueror of his own inclinations, conqueror of princi-\npalities and powers, and of \u201cthe rulers of the darkness of this world,\u201d\nand of \u201cspiritual wickedness in high places.\u201d Ephesians 6:12.\nIn no place is such instruction as this more needed, and nowhere\nwill it be productive of greater good, than in the home. Parents have\nto do with the very foundation of habit and character. The refor-\nPhysician, an Educator 83\nmatory movement must begin in presenting to them the principles\nof the law of God as bearing upon both physical and moral health.\nShow that obedience to God\u2019s word is our only safeguard against\nthe evils that are sweeping the world to destruction. Make plain\nthe responsibility of parents, not only for themselves, but for their\nchildren. They are giving to their children an example either of\nobedience or of transgression. By their example and teaching, the\ndestiny of their households is decided. The children will be what\ntheir parents make them.\nIf parents could be led to trace the result of their action, and\ncould see how, by their example and teaching, they perpetuate and\nincrease the power of sin or the power of righteousness, a change\nwould certainly be made. Many would turn away from tradition and\ncustom, and accept the divine principles of life.\nPower of Example [132]\nThe physician who ministers in the homes of the people, watch-\ning at the bedside of the sick, relieving their distress, bringing them\nback from the borders of the grave, speaking hope to the dying,\nwins a place in their confidence and affection, such as is granted to\nfew others. Not even to the minister of the gospel are committed\npossibilities so great or an influence so far-reaching.\nThe physician\u2019s example, no less than his teaching, should be a\npositive power on the right side. The cause of reform calls for men\nand women whose life practice is an illustration of self-control. It is\nour practice of the principles we inculcate that gives them weight.\nThe world needs a practical demonstration of what the grace of\nGod can do in restoring to human beings their lost kingship, giving\nthem mastery of themselves. There is nothing that the world needs [133]\nso much as a knowledge of the gospel\u2019s saving power revealed in\nChristlike lives.\nThe physician is continually brought into contact with those who\nneed the strength and encouragement of a right example. Many are\nweak in moral power. They lack self-control and are easily overcome\nby temptation. The physician can help these souls only as he reveals\nin his own life a strength of principle that enables him to triumph\nover every injurious habit and defiling lust. In his life must be seen\n84 The Ministry of Healing\nthe working of a power that is divine. If he fails here, however\nforcible or persuasive his words may be, his influence will tell for\nevil.\nMany seek medical advice and treatment who have become\nmoral wrecks through their own wrong habits. They are bruised\nand weak and wounded, feeling their folly and their inability to\novercome. Such ones should have nothing in their surroundings\nto encourage a continuance of the thoughts and feelings that have\nmade them what they are. They need to breathe an atmosphere of\npurity, of high and noble thought. How terrible the responsibility\nwhen those who should give them a right example are themselves\nenthralled by hurtful habits, their influence affording to temptation\nan added strength!\nThe Physician and the Temperance Work\nMany come under the physician\u2019s care who are ruining soul and\nbody by the use of tobacco or intoxicating drink. The physician who\nis true to his responsibility must point out to these patients the cause\nof their suffering. But if he himself is a user of tobacco or intoxicants,\nwhat weight will be given to his words? With the consciousness\nof his own indulgence before him, will he not hesitate to point out\nthe plague spot in the life of his patient? While using these things\nhimself, how can he convince the youth of their injurious effects?\nHow can a physician stand in the community as an example of[134]\npurity and self-control, how can he be an effectual worker in the\ntemperance cause, while he himself is indulging a vile habit? How\ncan he minister acceptably at the bedside of the sick and the dying,\nwhen his very breath is offensive, laden with the odor of liquor or\ntobacco?\nWhile disordering his nerves and clouding his brain by the use\nof narcotic poisons, how can one be true to the trust reposed in him\nas a skillful physician? How impossible for him to discern quickly\nor to execute with precision!\nIf he does not observe the laws that govern his own being, if\nhe chooses selfish gratification above soundness of mind and body,\ndoes he not thereby declare himself unfit to be entrusted with the\nresponsibility of human lives?\nPhysician, an Educator 85\nHowever skilled and faithful a physician may be, there is in his\nexperience much of apparent discouragement and defeat. Often his\nwork fails of accomplishing that which he longs to see accomplished.\nThough health is restored to his patients, it may be no real benefit\nto them or to the world. Many recover health, only to repeat the\nindulgences that invited disease. With the same eagerness as before,\nthey plunge again into the round of self-indulgence and folly. The\nphysician\u2019s work for them seems like effort thrown away.\nChrist had the same experience, yet He did not cease His efforts\nfor one suffering soul. Of the ten lepers who were cleansed, only\none appreciated the gift, and he was a stranger and a Samaritan. For\nthe sake of that one, Christ healed the ten. If the physician meets\nwith no better success than the Saviour had, let him learn a lesson\nfrom the Chief Physician. Of Christ it is written, \u201cHe shall not fail\nnor be discouraged.\u201d \u201cHe shall see of the travail of His soul, and\nshall be satisfied.\u201d Isaiah 42:4; 53:11.\nIf but one soul would have accepted the gospel of His grace, [135]\nChrist would, to save that one, have chosen His life of toil and\nhumiliation and His death of shame. If through our efforts one\nhuman being shall be uplifted and ennobled, fitted to shine in the\ncourts of the Lord, have we not cause for rejoicing?\nThe duties of the physician are arduous and trying. In order to\nperform them most successfully he needs to have a strong constitu-\ntion and vigorous health. A man that is feeble or diseased cannot\nendure the wearing labor incident to the physician\u2019s calling. One\nwho lacks perfect self-control cannot become qualified to deal with\nall classes of disease.\nOften deprived of sleep, neglecting even to take food, cut off\nin great degree from social enjoyment and religious privileges, the\nphysician\u2019s life seems to lie under a continual shadow. The affliction\nhe beholds, the dependent mortals longing for help, his contact with\nthe depraved, make the heart sick, and well-nigh destroy confidence\nin humanity.\nIn the battle with disease and death every energy is taxed to\nthe limit of endurance. The reaction from this terrible strain tests\nthe character to the utmost. Then it is that temptation has greatest\npower. More than men in any other calling, is the physician in need\nof self-control, purity of spirit, and that faith which takes hold on\n86 The Ministry of Healing\nheaven. For the sake of others and for his own sake, he cannot afford\nto disregard physical law. Recklessness in physical habits tends to\nrecklessness in morals.\nThe physician\u2019s only safety is, under all circumstances, to act\nfrom principle, strengthened and ennobled by a firmness of purpose\nfound only in God. He is to stand in the moral excellence of His\ncharacter. Day by day, hour by hour, moment by moment, he is\nto live as in the sight of the unseen world. As did Moses, he must[136]\nendure \u201cas seeing Him who is invisible.\u201d\nRighteousness has its root in godliness. No man can steadily\nmaintain before his fellow men a pure, forceful life unless his life\nis hid with Christ in God. The greater the activity among men, the\ncloser must be the communion of the heart with heaven.\nThe more urgent his duties and the greater his responsibilities,\nthe greater the physician\u2019s need of divine power. Time must be\nredeemed from things temporal, for meditation upon things eternal.\nHe must resist an encroaching world, which would so press upon him\nas to separate him from the Source of strength. Above all other men\nshould he, by prayer and the study of the Scriptures, place himself\nunder the protecting shield of God. He is to live in hourly contact and\nconscious communion with the principles of truth, righteousness,\nand mercy that reveal God\u2019s attributes within the soul.\nJust to the degree in which the word of God is received and\nobeyed will it impress with its potency and touch with its life ev-\nery spring of action, every phase of character. It will purify every\nthought, regulate every desire. Those who make God\u2019s word their\ntrust will quit themselves like men and be strong. They will rise\nabove all baser things into an atmosphere free from defilement.\nWhen man is in fellowship with God, that unswerving purpose\nwhich preserved Joseph and Daniel amidst the corruption of heathen\ncourts will make his a life of unsullied purity. His robes of character\nwill be spotless. In his life the light of Christ will be undimmed.\nThe bright and morning Star will appear shining steadfastly above\nhim in changeless glory.\nSuch a life will be an element of strength in the community. It\nwill be a barrier against evil, a safeguard to the tempted, a guiding\nlight to those who, amidst difficulties and discouragements, are\nseeking the right way.\nMedical Missionaries and their Work [137]\n[138]\nThey \u201cshall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the Lord. \u201d\nChapter 9\u2014Teaching and Healing[139]\nWhen Christ sent out the twelve disciples on their first missionary\ntour, He bade them, \u201cAs ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of\nheaven is at hand. Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead,\ncast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.\u201d Matthew 10:7,\n8.\nTo the Seventy sent forth later He said: \u201cInto whatsoever city\nye enter, ... heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The\nkingdom of God is come nigh unto you.\u201d Luke 10:8, 9. The presence\nand power of Christ was with them, \u201cand the Seventy returned again\nwith joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through\nThy name.\u201d Verse 17.\nAfter Christ\u2019s ascension the same work was continued. The\nscenes of His own ministry were repeated. \u201cOut of the cities round\nabout\u201d there came a multitude \u201cunto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks,\nand them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were\nhealed every one.\u201d Acts 5:16.\nAnd the disciples \u201cwent forth, and preached everywhere, the\nLord working with them.\u201d \u201cPhilip went down to the city of Samaria,\nand preached Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave\nheed unto those things which Philip spake.... For unclean spirits ...\ncame out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken[140]\nwith palsies, and that were lame, were healed. And there was great\njoy in that city.\u201d Mark 16:20; Acts 8:5-8.\nWork of the Disciples\nLuke, the writer of the Gospel that bears his name, was a medical\nmissionary. In the Scriptures he is called \u201cthe beloved physician.\u201d\nColossians 4:14. The apostle Paul heard of his skill as a physician,\nand sought him out as one to whom the Lord had entrusted a special\nwork. He secured his co-operation, and for some time Luke accom-\npanied him in his travels from place to place. After a time, Paul[141]\n88\nTeaching and Healing 89\nleft Luke at Philippi, in Macedonia. Here he continued to labor for\nseveral years, both as a physician and as a teacher of the gospel. In\nhis work as a physician he ministered to the sick, and then prayed\nfor the healing power of God to rest upon the afflicted ones. Thus\nthe way was opened for the gospel message. Luke\u2019s success as a\nphysician gained for him many opportunities for preaching Christ\namong the heathen. It is the divine plan that we shall work as the\ndisciples worked. Physical healing is bound up with the gospel\ncommission. In the work of the gospel, teaching and healing are\nnever to be separated.\nThe work of the disciples was to spread a knowledge of the\ngospel. To them was committed the work of proclaiming to all the\nworld the good news that Christ brought to men. That work they\naccomplished for the people of their time. To every nation under\nheaven the gospel was carried in a single generation.\nThe giving of the gospel to the world is the work that God has\ncommitted to those who bear His name. For earth\u2019s sin and misery\nthe gospel is the only antidote. To make known to all mankind the\nmessage of the grace of God is the first work of those who know its\nhealing power.\nWhen Christ sent forth the disciples with the gospel message, [142]\nfaith in God and His word had well-nigh departed from the world.\nAmong the Jewish people, who professed to have a knowledge of\nJehovah, His word had been set aside for tradition and human specu-\nlation. Selfish ambition, love of ostentation, greed of gain, absorbed\nmen\u2019s thoughts. As reverence for God departed, so also departed\ncompassion toward men. Selfishness was the ruling principle, and\nSatan worked his will in the misery and degradation of mankind.\nSatanic agencies took possession of men. The bodies of human\nbeings, made for the dwelling place of God, became the habitation\nof demons. The senses, the nerves, the organs of men were worked\nby supernatural agencies in the indulgence of the vilest lust. The\nvery stamp of demons was impressed upon the countenances of men.\nHuman faces reflected the expression of the legions of evil with\nwhich men were possessed.\nWhat is the condition in the world today? Is not faith in the Bible\nas effectually destroyed by the higher criticism and speculation of\ntoday as it was by tradition and rabbinism in the days of Christ? Have\n90 The Ministry of Healing\nnot greed and ambition and love of pleasure as strong a hold on men\u2019s\nhearts now as they had then? In the professedly Christian world,\neven in the professed churches of Christ, how few are governed by\nChristian principles. In business, social, domestic, even religious\ncircles, how few make the teachings of Christ the rule of daily living.\nIs it not true that \u201cjustice standeth afar off: ... equity cannot enter....\nAnd he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey\u201d? Isaiah\n59:14, 15.\nWe are living in the midst of an \u201cepidemic of crime,\u201d at which\nthoughtful, God-fearing men everywhere stand aghast. The corrup-\ntion that prevails, it is beyond the power of the human pen to describe.\nEvery day brings fresh revelations of political strife, bribery, and\nfraud. Every day brings its heart-sickening record of violence and\nlawlessness, of indifference to human suffering, of brutal, fiendish[143]\ndestruction of human life. Every day testifies to the increase of in-\nsanity, murder, and suicide. Who can doubt that satanic agencies are\nat work among men with increasing activity to distract and corrupt\nthe mind, and defile and destroy the body?\nAnd while the world is filled with these evils, the gospel is\ntoo often presented in so indifferent a manner as to make but little\nimpression upon the consciences or the lives of men. Everywhere\nthere are hearts crying out for something which they have not. They\nlong for a power that will give them mastery over sin, a power that\nwill deliver them from the bondage of evil, a power that will give\nhealth and life and peace. Many who once knew the power of God\u2019s\nword have dwelt where there is no recognition of God, and they long\nfor the divine presence.\nThe world needs today what it needed nineteen hundred years\nago\u2014a revelation of Christ. A great work of reform is demanded,\nand it is only through the grace of Christ that the work of restoration,\nphysical, mental, and spiritual, can be accomplished.\nChrist\u2019s method alone will give true success in reaching the\npeople. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their\ngood. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs,\nand won their confidence. Then He bade them, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d\nThere is need of coming close to the people by personal effort.\nIf less time were given to sermonizing, and more time were spent\nin personal ministry, greater results would be seen. The poor are\nTeaching and Healing 91\nto be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the bereaved\ncomforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced counseled. We\nare to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that rejoice.\nAccompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer, the [144]\npower of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without\nfruit.\nWe should ever remember that the object of the medical mission-\nary work is to point sin-sick men and women to the Man of Calvary,\nwho taketh away the sin of the world. By beholding Him, they will\nbe changed into His likeness. We are to encourage the sick and\nsuffering to look to Jesus and live. Let the workers keep Christ, the\nGreat Physician, constantly before those to whom disease of body\nand soul has brought discouragement. Point them to the One who\ncan heal both physical and spiritual disease. Tell them of the One\nwho is touched with the feeling of their infirmities. Encourage them\nto place themselves in the care of Him who gave His life to make it\npossible for them to have life eternal. Talk of His love; tell of His\npower to save.\nThis is the high duty and precious privilege of the medical mis-\nsionary. And personal ministry often prepares the way for this. God\noften reaches hearts through our efforts to relieve physical suffering.\nMedical missionary work is the pioneer work of the gospel. In\nthe ministry of the word and in the medical missionary work the\ngospel is to be preached and practiced.\nIn almost every community there are large numbers who do\nnot listen to the preaching of God\u2019s word or attend any religious\nservice. If they are reached by the gospel, it must be carried to\ntheir homes. Often the relief of their physical needs is the only\navenue by which they can be approached. Missionary nurses who\ncare for the sick and relieve the distress of the poor will find many\nopportunities to pray with them, to read to them from God\u2019s word,\nand to speak of the Saviour. They can pray with and for the helpless\nones who have not strength of will to control the appetites that\npassion has degraded. They can bring a ray of hope into the lives of [145]\nthe defeated and disheartened. Their unselfish love, manifested in\nacts of disinterested kindness, will make it easier for these suffering\nones to believe in the love of Christ.\n92 The Ministry of Healing\nMany have no faith in God and have lost confidence in man. But\nthey appreciate acts of sympathy and helpfulness. As they see one\nwith no inducement of earthly praise or compensation come into\ntheir homes, ministering to the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing\nthe naked, comforting the sad, and tenderly pointing all to Him of\nwhose love and pity the human worker is but the messenger\u2014as\nthey see this, their hearts are touched. Gratitude springs up. Faith is\nkindled. They see that God cares for them, and they are prepared to\nlisten as His word is opened.\nWhether in foreign missions or in the home field, all mission-\naries, both men and women, will gain much more ready access to[146]\nthe people, and will find their usefulness greatly increased, if they\nare able to minister to the sick. Women who go as missionaries to\nheathen lands may thus find opportunity for giving the gospel to the\nwomen of these lands, when every other door of access is closed.\nAll gospel workers should know how to give the simple treatments\nthat do so much to relieve pain and remove disease.\nTeaching Health Principles\nGospel workers should be able also to give instruction in the\nprinciples of healthful living. There is sickness everywhere, and\nmost of it might be prevented by attention to the laws of health.\nThe people need to see the bearing of health principles upon their\nwell-being, both for this life and for the life to come. They need to\nbe awakened to their responsibility for the human habitation fitted\nup by their Creator as His dwelling place, and over which He desires\nthem to be faithful stewards. They need to be impressed with the\ntruth conveyed in the words of Holy Writ:\n\u201cYe are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will\ndwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they\nshall be My people.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:16.\nThousands need and would gladly receive instruction concerning\nthe simple methods of treating the sick\u2014methods that are taking\nthe place of the use of poisonous drugs. There is great need of\ninstruction in regard to dietetic reform. Wrong habits of eating and\nthe use of unhealthful food are in no small degree responsible for\nthe intemperance and crime and wretchedness that curse the world.\nTeaching and Healing 93\nIn teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great ob-\nject of reform\u2014that its purpose is to secure the highest development\nof body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of nature, being\nthe laws of God, are designed for our good; that obedience to them\npromotes happiness in this life, and aids in the preparation for the\nlife to come.\nLead the people to study the manifestation of God\u2019s love and [147]\nwisdom in the works of nature. Lead them to study that marvelous\norganism, the human system, and the laws by which it is governed.\nThose who perceive the evidences of God\u2019s love, who understand\nsomething of the wisdom and beneficence of His laws, and the results\nof obedience, will come to regard their duties and obligations from\nan altogether different point of view. Instead of looking upon an\nobservance of the laws of health as a matter of sacrifice or self-denial,\nthey will regard it, as it really is, as an inestimable blessing.\nEvery gospel worker should feel that the giving of instruction in\nthe principles of healthful living is a part of his appointed work. Of\nthis work there is great need, and the world is open for it.\nEverywhere there is a tendency to substitute the work of organi-\nzations for individual effort. Human wisdom tends to consolidation,\nto centralization, to the building up of great churches and institu-\ntions. Multitudes leave to institutions and organizations the work of\nbenevolence; they excuse themselves from contact with the world,\nand their hearts grow cold. They become self-absorbed and unim-\npressible. Love for God and man dies out of the soul.\nChrist commits to His followers an individual work\u2014a work\nthat cannot be done by proxy. Ministry to the sick and the poor,\nthe giving of the gospel to the lost, is not to be left to committees\nor organized charities. Individual responsibility, individual effort,\npersonal sacrifice, is the requirement of the gospel.\n\u201cGo out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come\nin,\u201d is Christ\u2019s command, \u201cthat My house may be filled.\u201d He brings\nmen into touch with those whom they seek to benefit. \u201cBring the\npoor that are cast out to thy house,\u201d He says. \u201cWhen thou seest the [148]\nnaked, that thou cover him.\u201d \u201cThey shall lay hands on the sick, and\nthey shall recover.\u201d Luke 14:23; Isaiah 58:7; Mark 16:18. Through\ndirect contact, through personal ministry, the blessings of the gospel\nare to be communicated.\n94 The Ministry of Healing\nIn giving light to His people anciently, God did not work exclu-\nsively through any one class. Daniel was a prince of Judah. Isaiah\nalso was of the royal line. David was a shepherd boy, Amos a herds-\nman, Zechariah a captive from Babylon, Elisha a tiller of the soil.\nThe Lord raised up as His representatives prophets and princes, the\nnoble and the lowly, and taught them the truths to be given to the\nworld.\nTo everyone who becomes a partaker of His grace the Lord ap-\npoints a work for others. Individually we are to stand in our lot and\nplace, saying, \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8. Upon the minister\nof the word, the missionary nurse, the Christian physician, the in-\ndividual Christian, whether he be merchant or farmer, professional\nman or mechanic\u2014the responsibility rests upon all. It is our work\nto reveal to men the gospel of their salvation. Every enterprise in\nwhich we engage should be a means to this end.\nThose who take up their appointed work will not only be a bless-\ning to others, but they will themselves be blessed. The consciousness\nof duty well done will have a reflex influence upon their own souls.\nThe despondent will forget their despondency, the weak will become\nstrong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will find an unfailing helper\nin Him who has called them.\nThe church of Christ is organized for service. Its watchword is\nministry. Its members are soldiers, to be trained for conflict under the\nCaptain of their salvation. Christian ministers, physicians, teachers,\nhave a broader work than many have recognized. They are not only[149]\nto minister to the people, but to teach them to minister. They should\nnot only give instruction in right principles, but educate their hearers\nto impart these principles. Truth that is not lived, that is not imparted,\nloses its life-giving power, its healing virtue. Its blessing can be\nretained only as it is shared.\nThe monotony of our service for God needs to be broken up.\nEvery church member should be engaged in some line of service\nfor the Master. Some cannot do so much as others, but everyone\nshould do his utmost to roll back the tide of disease and distress\nthat is sweeping over our world. Many would be willing to work\nif they were taught how to begin. They need to be instructed and\nencouraged.\nTeaching and Healing 95\nEvery church should be a training school for Christian workers.\nIts members should be taught how to give Bible readings, how to\nconduct and teach Sabbath-school classes, how best to help the poor\nand to care for the sick, how to work for the unconverted. There\nshould be schools of health, cooking schools, and classes in various\nlines of Christian help work. There should not only be teaching, but\nactual work under experienced instructors. Let the teachers lead the\nway in working among the people, and others, uniting with them,\nwill learn from their example. One example is worth more than\nmany precepts.\nLet all cultivate their physical and mental powers to the utmost\nof their ability, that they may work for God where His providence\nshall call them. The same grace that came from Christ to Paul\nand Apollos, that distinguished them for spiritual excellencies, will\ntoday be imparted to devoted Christian missionaries. God desires His\nchildren to have intelligence and knowledge, that with unmistakable\nclearness and power His glory may be revealed in our world.\nEducated workers who are consecrated to God can do service in [150]\na greater variety of ways and can accomplish more extensive work\nthan can those who are uneducated. Their discipline of mind places\nthem on vantage ground. But those who have neither great talents\nnor extensive education may minister acceptably to others. God will\nuse men who are willing to be used. It is not the most brilliant or\nthe most talented persons whose work produces the greatest and\nmost lasting results. Men and women are needed who have heard\na message from heaven. The most effective workers are those who\nrespond to the invitation, \u201cTake My yoke upon you, and learn of\nMe.\u201d Matthew 11:29.\nIt is heart missionaries that are needed. He whose heart God\ntouches is filled with a great longing for those who have never\nknown His love. Their condition impresses him with a sense of\npersonal woe. Taking his life in his hand, he goes forth, a heaven-\nsent, heaven-inspired messenger, to do a work in which angels can\nco-operate.\nIf those to whom God has entrusted great talents of intellect put\nthese gifts to a selfish use, they will be left, after a period of trial,\nto follow their own way. God will take men who do not appear\nto be so richly endowed, who have not large self-confidence, and\n96 The Ministry of Healing\nHe will make the weak strong, because they trust in Him to do for\nthem that which they cannot do for themselves. God will accept the\nwholehearted service, and will Himself make up the deficiencies.\nThe Lord has often chosen for His colaborers men who have\nhad opportunity to obtain but a limited school education. These\nmen have applied their powers most diligently, and the Lord has\nrewarded their fidelity to His work, their industry, their thirst for\nknowledge. He has witnessed their tears and heard their prayers. As\nHis blessing came to the captives in the courts of Babylon, so does\nHe give wisdom and knowledge to His workers today.\nMen deficient in school education, lowly in social position, have,[151]\nthrough the grace of Christ, sometimes been wonderfully successful\nin winning souls for Him. The secret of their success was their\nconfidence in God. They learned daily of Him who is wonderful in\ncounsel and mighty in power.\nSuch workers are to be encouraged. The Lord brings them into\nconnection with those of more marked ability, to fill up the gaps\nthat others leave. Their quickness to see what is to be done, their\nreadiness to help those in need, their kind words and deeds, open\ndoors of usefulness that otherwise would remain closed. They come\nclose to those in trouble, and the persuasive influence of their words\nhas power to draw many trembling souls to God. Their work shows\nwhat thousands of others might do, if they only would.\nA Broader Life\nNothing will so arouse a self-sacrificing zeal and broaden and\nstrengthen the character as to engage in work for others. Many\nprofessed Christians, in seeking church relationship, think only of\nthemselves. They wish to enjoy church fellowship and pastoral\ncare. They become members of large and prosperous churches,\nand are content to do little for others. In this way they are robbing\nthemselves of the most precious blessings. Many would be greatly\nbenefited by sacrificing their pleasant, ease-conducing associations.\nThey need to go where their energies will be called out in Christian\nwork and they can learn to bear responsibilities.\nTrees that are crowded closely together do not grow healthfully[152]\nand sturdily. The gardener transplants them that they may have room\nTeaching and Healing 97\nto develop. A similar work would benefit many of the members of\nlarge churches. They need to be placed where their energies will be\ncalled forth in active Christian effort. They are losing their spiritual\nlife, becoming dwarfed and inefficient, for want of self-sacrificing\nlabor for others. Transplanted to some missionary field, they would\ngrow strong and vigorous.\nBut none need wait until called to some distant field before\nbeginning to help others. Doors of service are open everywhere. All\naround us are those who need our help. The widow, the orphan, the\nsick and the dying, the heartsick, the discouraged, the ignorant, and\nthe outcast are on every hand.\nWe should feel it our special duty to work for those living in\nour neighborhood. Study how you can best help those who take no\ninterest in religious things. As you visit your friends and neighbors,\nshow an interest in their spiritual as well as in their temporal welfare.\nSpeak to them of Christ as a sin-pardoning Saviour. Invite your\nneighbors to your home, and read with them from the precious Bible\nand from books that explain its truths. Invite them to unite with you\nin song and prayer. In these little gatherings, Christ Himself will\nbe present, as He has promised, and hearts will be touched by His\ngrace.\nChurch members should educate themselves to do this work.\nThis is just as essential as to save the benighted souls in foreign\ncountries. While some feel the burden for souls afar off, let the many [153]\nwho are at home feel the burden of precious souls who are around\nthem, and work just as diligently for their salvation.\nMany regret that they are living a narrow life. They themselves\ncan make their life broad and influential if they will. Those who love\nJesus with heart and mind and soul, and their neighbor as themselves,\nhave a wide field in which to use their ability and influence.\nLittle Opportunities\nLet none pass by little opportunities, to look for larger work. You\nmight do successfully the small work, but fail utterly in attempting\nthe larger work, and fall into discouragement. It is by doing with\nyour might what you find to do that you will develop aptitude for\nlarger work. It is by slighting the daily opportunities, by neglecting\n98 The Ministry of Healing\nthe little things right at hand, that so many become fruitless and\nwithered.\nDo not depend upon human aid. Look beyond human beings to\nthe One appointed by God to bear our griefs, to carry our sorrows,\nand to supply our necessities. Taking God at His word, make a\nbeginning wherever you find work to do, and move forward with\nunfaltering faith. It is faith in Christ\u2019s presence that gives strength\nand steadfastness. Work with unselfish interest, with painstaking\neffort, with persevering energy.\nIn fields where the conditions are so objectionable and disheart-\nening that many are unwilling to go to them, remarkable changes\nhave been wrought by the efforts of self-sacrificing workers. Pa-[154]\ntiently and perseveringly they labored, not relying upon human\npower, but upon God, and His grace sustained them. The amount\nof good thus accomplished will never be known in this world, but\nblessed results will be seen in the great hereafter.\nSelf-Supporting Missionaries\nIn many places self-supporting missionaries can work success-\nfully. It was as a self-supporting missionary that the apostle Paul\nlabored in spreading the knowledge of Christ throughout the world.\nWhile daily teaching the gospel in the great cities of Asia and Eu-\nrope, he wrought at the trade of a craftsman to sustain himself and\nhis companions. His parting words to the elders of Ephesus, showing\nhis manner of labor, have precious lessons for every gospel worker:\n\u201cYe know,\u201d he said, \u201cafter what manner I have been with you\nat all seasons: ... and how I kept back nothing that was profitable\nunto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and\nfrom house to house.... I have coveted no man\u2019s silver, or gold, or\napparel. Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered\nunto my necessities, and to them that were with me. I have showed\nyou all things, how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak,\nand to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is\nmore blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Acts 20:18-35.\nMany today, if imbued with the same spirit of self-sacrifice,\ncould do a good work in a similar way. Let two or more start out\ntogether in evangelistic work. Let them visit the people, praying,\nTeaching and Healing 99\nsinging, teaching, explaining the Scriptures, and ministering to the\nsick. Some can sustain themselves as canvassers; others, like the\napostle, can labor at some handicraft or in other lines of effort. As [155]\nthey move forward in their work, realizing their helplessness, but\nhumbly depending upon God, they gain a blessed experience. The\nLord Jesus goes before them, and among the wealthy and the poor\nthey find favor and help.\nThose who have been trained for medical missionary work in\nforeign countries should be encouraged to go without delay where\nthey expect to labor, and begin work among the people, learning\nthe language as they work. Very soon they will be able to teach the\nsimple truths of God\u2019s word.\nThroughout the world, messengers of mercy are needed. There\nis a call for Christian families to go into communities that are in\ndarkness and error, to go to foreign fields, to become acquainted\nwith the needs of their fellow men, and to work for the cause of the\nMaster. If such families would settle in the dark places of the earth,\nplaces where the people are enshrouded in spiritual gloom, and let\nthe light of Christ\u2019s life shine out through them, what a noble work [156]\nmight be accomplished.\nThis work requires self-sacrifice. While many are waiting to have\nevery obstacle removed, the work they might do is left undone, and\nmultitudes are dying without hope and without God. Some for the\nsake of commercial advantage, or to acquire scientific knowledge,\nwill venture into unsettled regions and cheerfully endure sacrifice\nand hardship; but how few for the sake of their fellow men are\nwilling to move their families into regions that are in need of the\ngospel.\nTo reach the people, wherever they are, and whatever their posi-\ntion or condition, and to help them in every way possible\u2014this is\ntrue ministry. By such effort you may win hearts and open a door of\naccess to perishing souls.\nIn all your work remember that you are bound up with Christ, a\npart of the great plan of redemption. The love of Christ, in a healing,\nlife-giving current, is to flow through your life. As you seek to draw\nothers within the circle of His love, let the purity of your language,\nthe unselfishness of your service, the joyfulness of your demeanor,\nbear witness to the power of His grace. Give to the world so pure\n100 The Ministry of Healing\nand righteous a representation of Him, that men shall behold Him in\nHis beauty.\nIt is of little use to try to reform others by attacking what we may\nregard as wrong habits. Such effort often results in more harm than\ngood. In His talk with the Samaritan woman, instead of disparaging\nJacob\u2019s well, Christ presented something better. \u201cIf thou knewest\nthe gift of God,\u201d He said, \u201cand who it is that saith to thee, Give\nMe to drink; thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have\ngiven thee living water.\u201d John 4:10. He turned the conversation to\nthe treasure He had to bestow, offering the woman something better[157]\nthan she possessed, even living water, the joy and hope of the gospel.\nThis is an illustration of the way in which we are to work. We\nmust offer men something better than that which they possess, even\nthe peace of Christ, which passeth all understanding. We must\ntell them of God\u2019s holy law, the transcript of His character, and an\nexpression of that which He wishes them to become. Show them\nhow infinitely superior to the fleeting joys and pleasures of the world\nis the imperishable glory of heaven. Tell them of the freedom and\nrest to be found in the Saviour. \u201cWhosoever drinketh of the water\nthat I shall give him shall never thirst,\u201d He declared. Verse 14.\nLift up Jesus, crying, \u201cBehold, the Lamb of God, that taketh\naway the sin of the world!\u201d John 1:29, A.R.V . He alone can satisfy\nthe craving of the heart and give peace to the soul.\nOf all people in the world, reformers should be the most un-\nselfish, the most kind, the most courteous. In their lives should be\nseen the true goodness of unselfish deeds. The worker who mani-\nfests a lack of courtesy, who shows impatience at the ignorance on\nwaywardness of others, who speaks hastily or acts thoughtlessly,\nmay close the door to hearts so that he can never reach them.\nAs the dew and the still showers fall upon the withering plants,\nso let words fall gently when seeking to win men from error. God\u2019s\nplan is first to reach the heart. We are to speak the truth in love,\ntrusting in Him to give it power for the reforming of the life. The\nHoly Spirit will apply to the soul the word that is spoken in love.\nNaturally we are self-centered and opinionated. But when we\nlearn the lessons that Christ desires to teach us, we become partakers\nof His nature; henceforth we live His life. The wonderful example\nof Christ, the matchless tenderness with which He entered into the\nTeaching and Healing 101\nfeelings of others, weeping with those who wept, rejoicing with\nthose who rejoiced, must have a deep influence upon the character [158]\nof all who follow Him in sincerity. By kindly words and acts they\nwill try to make the path easy for weary feet.\n\u201cThe Lord Eternal hath given me a tongue for teaching.\u201d \u201cThat I\nshould know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary.\u201d\nIsaiah 50:4, Leeser; A.V .\nAll around us are afflicted souls. Here and there, everywhere,\nwe may find them. Let us search out these suffering ones and speak\na word in season to comfort their hearts. Let us ever be channels\nthrough which shall flow the refreshing waters of compassion.\nIn all our associations it should be remembered that in the expe-\nrience of others there are chapters sealed from mortal sight. On the\npages of memory are sad histories that are sacredly guarded from\ncurious eyes. There stand registered long, hard battles with trying\ncircumstances, perhaps troubles in the home life, that day by day\nweaken courage, confidence, and faith. Those who are fighting the\nbattle of life at great odds may be strengthened and encouraged by\nlittle attentions that cost only a loving effort. To such the strong,\nhelpful grasp of the hand by a true friend is worth more than gold or\nsilver. Words of kindness are as welcome as the smile of angels.\nThere are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled to labor\nhard for small wages, and able to secure but the barest necessities of\nlife. Toil and deprivation, with no hope of better things, make their\nburden very heavy. When pain and sickness are added, the burden\nis almost insupportable. Careworn and oppressed, they know not\nwhere to turn for relief. Sympathize with them in their trials, their\nheartaches, and disappointments. This will open the way for you\nto help them. Speak to them of God\u2019s promises, pray with and for\nthem, inspire them with hope.\nWords of cheer and encouragement spoken when the soul is sick [159]\nand the pulse of courage is low\u2014these are regarded by the Saviour\nas if spoken to Himself. As hearts are cheered, the heavenly angels\nlook on in pleased recognition.\nFrom age to age the Lord has been seeking to awaken in the\nsouls of men a sense of their divine brotherhood. Be co-workers\nwith Him. While distrust and alienation are pervading the world,\nChrist\u2019s disciples are to reveal the spirit that reigns in heaven.\n102 The Ministry of Healing\nSpeak as He would speak, act as He would act. Constantly\nreveal the sweetness of His character. Reveal that wealth of love\nwhich underlies all His teachings and all His dealings with men. The\nhumblest workers, in co-operation with Christ, may touch chords\nwhose vibrations shall ring to the ends of the earth and make melody\nthroughout eternal ages.\nHeavenly intelligences are waiting to co-operate with human\ninstrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world what human be-\nings may become, and what, through union with the Divine, may be\naccomplished for the saving of souls that are ready to perish. There\nis no limit to the usefulness of one who, putting self aside, makes\nroom for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart and lives a\nlife wholly consecrated to God. All who consecrate body, soul, and\nspirit to His service will be constantly receiving a new endowment\nof physical, mental, and spiritual power. The inexhaustible supplies\nof heaven are at their command. Christ gives them the breath of His\nown Spirit, the life of His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its\nhighest energies to work in mind and heart. Through the grace given\nus we may achieve victories that because of our own erroneous and\npreconceived opinions, our defects of character, our smallness of\nfaith, have seemed impossible.\nTo everyone who offers himself to the Lord for service, with-[160]\nholding nothing, is given power for the attainment of measureless\nresults. For these God will do great things. He will work upon the\nminds of men so that, even in this world, there shall be seen in their\nlives a fulfillment of the promise of the future state.\n\u201cThe wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;\nAnd the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.\nIt shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and\nsinging;\nThe glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,\nThe excellency of Carmel and Sharon,\nThey shall see the glory of the Lord,\nAnd the excellency of our God.\n\u201cStrengthen ye the weak hands,\nAnd confirm the feeble knees.\nTeaching and Healing 103\nSay to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not;\nBehold, your God....\n\u201cThen the eyes of the blind shall be opened,\nAnd the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.\nThen shall the lame man leap as an hart,\nAnd the tongue of the dumb sing:\nFor in the wilderness shall waters break out,\nAnd streams in the desert.\n\u201cAnd the parched ground shall become a pool,\nAnd the thirsty land springs of water....\nAnd an highway shall be there, and a way,\nAnd it shall be called The way of holiness;\nThe unclean shall not pass over it;\nBut it shall be for those;\nThe wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.\n\u201cNo lion shall be there,\nNor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon,\nIt shall not be found there;\nBut the redeemed shall walk there;\nAnd the ransomed of the Lord shall return,\nAnd come to Zion with songs\nAnd everlasting joy upon their heads;\nThey shall obtain joy and gladness,\nAnd sorrow and sighing shall flee away.\u201d\nIsaiah 35:1-10.\nChapter 10\u2014Helping the Tempted[161]\nNot because we first loved Him did Christ love us; but \u201cwhile we\nwere yet sinners\u201d He died for us. He does not treat us according to\nour desert. Although our sins have merited condemnation, He does\nnot condemn us. Year after year He has borne with our weakness and\nignorance, with our ingratitude and waywardness. Notwithstanding\nour wanderings, our hardness of heart, our neglect of His Holy Word,\nHis hand is stretched out still.\nGrace is an attribute of God exercised toward undeserving human\nbeings. We did not seek for it, but it was sent in search of us. God\nrejoices to bestow His grace upon us, not because we are worthy, but\nbecause we are so utterly unworthy. Our only claim to His mercy is\nour great need.\nThe Lord God through Jesus Christ holds out His hand all the\nday long in invitation to the sinful and fallen. He will receive all. He\nwelcomes all. It is His glory to pardon the chief of sinners. He will\ntake the prey from the mighty, He will deliver the captive, He will\npluck the brand from the burning. He will lower the golden chain of\nHis mercy to the lowest depths of human wretchedness, and lift up\nthe debased soul contaminated with sin.\nEvery human being is the object of loving interest to Him who[162]\ngave His life that He might bring men back to God. Souls guilty and\nhelpless, liable to be destroyed by the arts and snares of Satan, are\ncared for as a shepherd cares for the sheep of his flock.\nThe Saviour\u2019s example is to be the standard of our service for\nthe tempted and the erring. The same interest and tenderness and\nlong-suffering that He has manifested toward us, we are to manifest\ntoward others. \u201cAs I have loved you,\u201d He says, \u201cthat ye also love\none another.\u201d John 13:34. If Christ dwells in us, we shall reveal His\nunselfish love toward all with whom we have to do. As we see men\nand women in need of sympathy and help, we shall not ask, \u201cAre\nthey worthy?\u201d but \u201cHow can I benefit them?\u201d\n104\nHelping the Tempted 105\nRich and poor, high and low, free and bond, are God\u2019s heritage.\nHe who gave His life to redeem man sees in every human being\na value that exceeds finite computation. By the mystery and glory\nof the cross we are to discern His estimate of the value of the soul. [163]\nWhen we do this, we shall feel that human beings, however degraded,\nhave cost too much to be treated with coldness or contempt. We\nshall realize the importance of working for our fellow men, that they\nmay be exalted to the throne of God.\nThe lost coin, in the Saviour\u2019s parable, though lying in the dirt\nand rubbish, was a piece of silver still. Its owner sought it because\nit was of value. So every soul, however degraded by sin, is in\nGod\u2019s sight accounted precious. As the coin bore the image and\nsuperscription of the reigning power, so man at his creation bore\nthe image and superscription of God. Though now marred and dim\nthrough the influence of sin, the traces of this inscription remain\nupon every soul. God desires to recover that soul and to retrace upon\nit His own image in righteousness and holiness.\nHow little do we enter into sympathy with Christ on that which\nshould be the strongest bond of union between us and Him\u2014com-\npassion for depraved, guilty, suffering souls, dead in trespasses and\nsins! The inhumanity of man toward man is our greatest sin. Many\nthink that they are representing the justice of God while they wholly\nfail of representing His tenderness and His great love. Often the ones\nwhom they meet with sternness and severity are under the stress of\ntemptation. Satan is wrestling with these souls, and harsh, unsym-\npathetic words discourage them and cause them to fall a prey to the\ntempter\u2019s power.\nIt is a delicate matter to deal with minds. Only He who reads\nthe heart knows how to bring men to repentance. Only His wisdom\ncan give us success in reaching the lost. You may stand up stiffly,\nfeeling, \u201cI am holier than thou,\u201d and it matters not how correct your\nreasoning or how true your words; they will never touch hearts. The\nlove of Christ, manifested in word and act, will win its way to the [164]\nsoul, when the reiteration of precept or argument would accomplish\nnothing.\nWe need more of Christlike sympathy; not merely sympathy\nfor those who appear to us to be faultless, but sympathy for poor,\nsuffering, struggling souls, who are often overtaken in fault, sinning\n106 The Ministry of Healing\nand repenting, tempted and discouraged. We are to go to our fellow\nmen, touched, like our merciful High Priest, with the feeling of their\ninfirmities.\nIt was the outcast, the publican and sinner, the despised of the\nnations, that Christ called and by His loving-kindness compelled to\ncome unto Him. The one class that He would never countenance\nwas those who stood apart in their self-esteem and looked down\nupon others.\n\u201cGo out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come\nin,\u201d Christ bids us, \u201cthat My house may be filled.\u201d In obedience\nto this word we must go to the heathen who are near us, and to\nthose who are afar off. The \u201cpublicans and harlots\u201d must hear the\nSaviour\u2019s invitation. Through the kindness and long-suffering of\nHis messengers the invitation becomes a compelling power to uplift\nthose who are sunken in the lowest depths of sin.\nChristian motives demand that we work with a steady purpose,\nan undying interest, an ever-increasing importunity, for the souls\nwhom Satan is seeking to destroy. Nothing is to chill the earnest,\nyearning energy for the salvation of the lost.\nMark how all through the word of God there is manifest the\nspirit of urgency, of imploring men and women to come to Christ.\nWe must seize upon every opportunity, in private and in public,\npresenting every argument, urging every motive of infinite weight,\nto draw men to the Saviour. With all our power we must urge them\nto look unto Jesus and to accept His life of self-denial and sacrifice.[165]\nWe must show that we expect them to give joy to the heart of Christ\nby using every one of His gifts in honoring His name.\nSaved by Hope\n\u201cWe are saved by hope.\u201d Romans 8:24. The fallen must be led\nto feel that it is not too late for them to be men. Christ honored man\nwith His confidence and thus placed him on his honor. Even those\nwho had fallen the lowest He treated with respect. It was a continual\npain to Christ to be brought into contact with enmity, depravity, and\nimpurity; but never did He utter one expression to show that His\nsensibilities were shocked or His refined tastes offended. Whatever\nthe evil habits, the strong prejudices, or the overbearing passions\nHelping the Tempted 107\nof human beings, He met them all with pitying tenderness. As we\npartake of His Spirit, we shall regard all men as brethren, with similar\ntemptations and trials, often falling and struggling to rise again,\nbattling with discouragements and difficulties, craving sympathy\nand help. Then we shall meet them in such a way as not to discourage\nor repel them, but to awaken hope in their hearts. As they are thus\nencouraged, they can say with confidence, \u201cRejoice not against me, [166]\nO mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the\nLord shall be a light unto me.\u201d He will \u201cplead my cause, and execute\njudgment for me: He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall\nbehold His righteousness.\u201d Micah 7:8, 9.\nGod \u201clooketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.\nHe fashioneth their hearts alike.\u201d\nPsalm 33:14, 15.\nHe bids us, in dealing with the tempted and the erring, consider\n\u201cthyself, lest thou also be tempted.\u201d Galatians 6:1. With a sense of\nour own infirmities, we shall have compassion for the infirmities of\nothers.\n\u201cWho maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou\nthat thou didst not receive? \u201cOne is your Master; ... and all ye are\nbrethren.\u201d \u201cWhy dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at\nnought thy brother?\u201d \u201cLet us not therefore judge one another: ... but\njudge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to\nfall in his brother\u2019s way.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:7; Matthew 23:8; Romans\n14:10, 13.\nIt is always humiliating to have one\u2019s errors pointed out. None\nshould make the experience more bitter by needless censure. No one\nwas ever reclaimed by reproach; but many have thus been repelled\nand have been led to steel their hearts against conviction. A tender\nspirit, a gentle, winning deportment, may save the erring and hide a\nmultitude of sins.\nThe apostle Paul found it necessary to reprove wrong, but how\ncarefully he sought to show that he was a friend to the erring! How\nanxiously he explained to them the reason of his action! He made\nthem understand that it cost him pain to give them pain. He showed\n108 The Ministry of Healing\nhis confidence and sympathy toward the ones who were struggling\nto overcome.\n\u201cOut of much affliction and anguish of heart,\u201d he said, \u201cI wrote\nunto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that\nye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.\u201d[167]\n2 Corinthians 2:4. \u201cFor though I made you sorry with my epistle, I\ndo not regret it: though I did regret it, ... I now rejoice, not that ye\nwere made sorry, but that ye were made sorry unto repentance.... For\nbehold, this selfsame thing, that ye were made sorry after a godly\nsort, what earnest care it wrought in you, yea what clearing of your-\nselves, yea what indignation, yea what fear, yea what longing, yea\nwhat zeal, yea what avenging! In everything ye approved yourselves\nto be pure in the matter.... Therefore we have been comforted.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 7:8-13, A.R.V .\n\u201cI rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning\nyou.\u201d \u201cI thank my God upon every remembrance of you, always\nin every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, for\nyour fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;\u201d \u201cbeing\nconfident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you\nwill perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ: even as it is right for me\nto be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my\nheart.\u201d \u201cTherefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my\njoy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.\u201d \u201cNow\nwe live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.\u201d Verse 16, A.R.V .; Philippians\n1:3-5; 1:6, 7, A.R.V .; 4:1; 1 Thessalonians 3:8.\nPaul wrote to these brethren as \u201csaints in Christ Jesus;\u201d but he\nwas not writing to those who were perfect in character. He wrote\nto them as men and women who were striving against temptation\nand who were in danger of falling. He pointed them to \u201cthe God of\npeace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that Great\nShepherd of the sheep.\u201d He assured them that \u201cthrough the blood of\nthe everlasting covenant\u201d He will \u201cmake you perfect in every good\nwork to do His will, working in you that which is well pleasing in\nHis sight, through Jesus Christ.\u201d Hebrews 13:20, 21.\nWhen one at fault becomes conscious of his error, be careful not\nto destroy his self-respect. Do not discourage him by indifference or[168]\ndistrust. Do not say, \u201cBefore giving him my confidence, I will wait\nHelping the Tempted 109\nto see whether he will hold out.\u201d Often this very distrust causes the\ntempted one to stumble.\nWe should strive to understand the weakness of others. We know\nlittle of the heart trials of those who have been bound in chains of\ndarkness and who lack resolution and moral power. Most pitiable\nis the condition of him who is suffering under remorse; he is as\none stunned, staggering, sinking into the dust. He can see nothing\nclearly. The mind is beclouded, he knows not what steps to take.\nMany a poor soul is misunderstood, unappreciated, full of distress\nand agony\u2014a lost, straying sheep. He cannot find God, yet he has\nan intense longing for pardon and peace.\nOh, let no word be spoken to cause deeper pain! To the soul\nweary of a life of sin, but knowing not where to find relief, present\nthe compassionate Saviour. Take him by the hand, lift him up, speak\nto him words of courage and hope. Help him to grasp the hand of\nthe Saviour.\nWe become too easily discouraged over the souls who do not\nat once respond to our efforts. Never should we cease to labor for\na soul while there is one gleam of hope. Precious souls cost our\nself-sacrificing Redeemer too dear a price to be lightly given up to\nthe tempter\u2019s power.\nWe need to put ourselves in the place of the tempted ones. Con-\nsider the power of heredity, the influence of evil associations and\nsurroundings, the power of wrong habits. Can we wonder that under\nsuch influences many become degraded? Can we wonder that they\nshould be slow to respond to efforts for their uplifting?\nOften, when won to the gospel, those who appeared coarse and\nunpromising will be among its most loyal adherents and advocates.\nThey are not altogether corrupt. Beneath the forbidding exterior [169]\nthere are good impulses that might be reached. Without a helping\nhand many would never recover themselves, but by patient, per-\nsistent effort they may be uplifted. Such need tender words, kind\nconsideration, tangible help. They need that kind of counsel which\nwill not extinguish the faint gleam of courage in the soul. Let the\nworkers who come in contact with them consider this.\nSome will be found whose minds have been so long debased\nthat they will never in this life become what under more favorable\ncircumstances they might have been. But the bright beams of the\n110 The Ministry of Healing\nSun of Righteousness may shine into the soul. It is their privilege\nto have the life that measures with the life of God. Plant in their\nminds uplifting, ennobling thoughts. Let your life make plain to\nthem the difference between vice and purity, darkness and light. In\nyour example let them read what it means to be a Christian. Christ\nis able to uplift the most sinful and place them where they will\nbe acknowledged as children of God, joint heirs with Christ to the\nimmortal inheritance.\nBy the miracle of divine grace, many may be fitted for lives\nof usefulness. Despised and forsaken, they have become utterly\ndiscouraged; they may appear stoical and stolid. But under the min-\nistration of the Holy Spirit, the stupidity that makes their uplifting\nappear so hopeless will pass away. The dull, clouded mind will\nawake. The slave of sin will be set free. Vice will disappear, and\nignorance will be overcome. Through the faith that works by love,\nthe heart will be purified and the mind enlightened.\nChapter 11\u2014Working for the Intemperate [170]\n[171]\nEvery true reform has its place in the work of the gospel and tends\nto the uplifting of the soul to a new and nobler life. Especially does\nthe temperance reform demand the support of Christian workers.\nThey should call attention to this work and make it a living issue.\nEverywhere they should present to the people the principles of true\ntemperance and call for signers to the temperance pledge. Earnest\neffort should be made in behalf of those who are in bondage to evil\nhabits.\nThere is everywhere a work to be done for those who through\nintemperance have fallen. In the midst of churches, religious in-\nstitutions, and professedly Christian homes, many of the youth are\nchoosing the path to destruction. Through intemperate habits they\nbring upon themselves disease, and through greed to obtain money\nfor sinful indulgence they fall into dishonest practices. Health and\ncharacter are ruined. Aliens from God, outcasts from society, these\npoor souls feel that they are without hope either for this life or for\nthe life to come. The hearts of the parents are broken. Men speak of\nthese erring ones as hopeless; but not so does God regard them. He\nunderstands all the circumstances that have made them what they [172]\nare, and He looks upon them with pity. This is a class that demand\nhelp. Never give them occasion to say, \u201cNo man cares for my soul.\u201d\nAmong the victims of intemperance are men of all classes and\nall professions. Men of high station, of eminent talents, of great\nattainments, have yielded to the indulgence of appetite until they are\nhelpless to resist temptation. Some of them who were once in the\npossession of wealth are without home, without friends, in suffering,\nmisery, disease, and degradation. They have lost their self-control.\nUnless a helping hand is held out to them, they will sink lower and\nlower. With these, self-indulgence is not only a moral sin, but a\nphysical disease.\nOften in helping the intemperate we must, as Christ so often did,\ngive first attention to their physical condition. They need wholesome,\n111\n112 The Ministry of Healing\nunstimulating food and drink, clean clothing, opportunity to secure\nphysical cleanliness. They need to be surrounded with an atmosphere\nof helpful, uplifting Christian influence. In every city a place should\nbe provided where the slaves of evil habit may receive help to break\nthe chains that bind them. Strong drink is regarded by many as the\nonly solace in trouble; but this need not be, if, instead of acting the\npart of the priest and Levite, professed Christians would follow the\nexample of the good Samaritan.\nIn dealing with the victims of intemperance we must remember\nthat we are not dealing with sane men, but with those who for\nthe time being are under the power of a demon. Be patient and\nforbearing. Think not of the repulsive, forbidding appearance, but\nof the precious life that Christ died to redeem. As the drunkard\nawakens to a sense of his degradation, do all in your power to show\nthat you are his friend. Speak no word of censure. Let no act or\nlook express reproach or aversion. Very likely the poor soul curses\nhimself. Help him to rise. Speak words that will encourage faith.\nSeek to strengthen every good trait in his character. Teach him how[173]\nto reach upward. Show him that it is possible for him to live so as\nto win the respect of his fellow men. Help him to see the value of\nthe talents which God has given him, but which he has neglected to\nimprove.\nAlthough the will has been depraved and weakened, there is\nhope for him in Christ. He will awaken in the heart higher impulses\nand holier desires. Encourage him to lay hold of the hope set before\nhim in the gospel. Open the Bible before the tempted, struggling\none, and over and over again read to him the promises of God. These\npromises will be to him as the leaves of the tree of life. Patiently\ncontinue your efforts, until with grateful joy the trembling hand\ngrasps the hope of redemption through Christ.\nYou must hold fast to those whom you are trying to help, else\nvictory will never be yours. They will be continually tempted to evil.\nAgain and again they will be almost overcome by the craving for\nstrong drink; again and again they may fall; but do not, because of\nthis, cease your efforts.\nThey have decided to make an effort to live for Christ; but their\nwill power is weakened, and they must be carefully guarded by those\nwho watch for souls as they that must give an account. They have lost\nWorking for the Intemperate 113\ntheir manhood, and this they must win back. Many have to battle\nagainst strong hereditary tendencies to evil. Unnatural cravings,\nsensual impulses, were their inheritance from birth. These must be\ncarefully guarded against. Within and without, good and evil are\nstriving for the mastery. Those who have never passed through such\nexperiences cannot know the almost overmastering power of appetite\nor the fierceness of the conflict between habits of self-indulgence\nand the determination to be temperate in all things. Over and over\nagain the battle must be fought.\nMany who are drawn to Christ will not have moral courage to\ncontinue the warfare against appetite and passion. But the worker [174]\nmust not be discouraged by this. Is it only those rescued from the\nlowest depths that backslide?\nRemember that you do not work alone. Ministering angels unite\nin service with every truehearted son and daughter of God. And\nChrist is the restorer. The Great Physician Himself stands beside\nHis faithful workers, saying to the repentant soul, \u201cChild, thy sins\nbe forgiven thee.\u201d Mark 2:5, A.R.V . margin.\nMany are the outcasts who will grasp the hope set before them in\nthe gospel and will enter the kingdom of heaven, while others who\nwere blessed with great opportunities and great light which they did\nnot improve will be left in outer darkness.\nThe victims of evil habit must be aroused to the necessity of\nmaking an effort for themselves. Others may put forth the most\nearnest endeavor to uplift them, the grace of God may be freely\noffered, Christ may entreat, His angels may minister; but all will be\nin vain unless they themselves are roused to fight the battle in their\nown behalf.\nThe last words of David to Solomon, then a young man, and\nsoon to receive the crown of Israel, were, \u201cBe ... strong, ... and\nshow thyself a man.\u201d 1 Kings 2:2. To every child of humanity, the\ncandidate for an immortal crown, are these words of inspiration\nspoken, \u201cBe ... strong, ... and show thyself a man.\u201d\nThe self-indulgent must be led to see and feel that great moral\nrenovation is necessary if they would be men. God calls upon them\nto arouse and in the strength of Christ win back the God-given\nmanhood that has been sacrificed through sinful indulgence.\n114 The Ministry of Healing\nFeeling the terrible power of temptation, the drawing of desire\nthat leads to indulgence, many a man cries in despair, \u201cI cannot\nresist evil.\u201d Tell him that he can, that he must resist. He may have\nbeen overcome again and again, but it need not be always thus. He\nis weak in moral power, controlled by the habits of a life of sin. His[175]\npromises and resolutions are like ropes of sand. The knowledge of\nhis broken promises and forfeited pledges weakens his confidence\nin his own sincerity and causes him to feel that God cannot accept\nhim or work with his efforts. But he need not despair.\nThose who put their trust in Christ are not to be enslaved by\nany hereditary or cultivated habit or tendency. Instead of being held\nin bondage to the lower nature, they are to rule every appetite and\npassion. God has not left us to battle with evil in our own finite[176]\nstrength. Whatever may be our inherited or cultivated tendencies\nto wrong, we can overcome through the power that He is ready to\nimpart.\nThe Power of the Will\nThe tempted one needs to understand the true force of the will.\nThis is the governing power in the nature of man\u2014the power of\ndecision, of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the\nwill. Desires for goodness and purity are right, so far as they go; but\nif we stop here, they avail nothing. Many will go down to ruin while\nhoping and desiring to overcome their evil propensities. They do not\nyield the will to God. They do not choose to serve Him.\nGod has given us the power of choice; it is ours to exercise.\nWe cannot change our hearts, we cannot control our thoughts, our\nimpulses, our affections. We cannot make ourselves pure, fit for\nGod\u2019s service. But we can choose to serve God, we can give Him\nour will; then He will work in us to will and to do according to His\ngood pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be brought under the\ncontrol of Christ.\nThrough the right exercise of the will, an entire change may\nbe made in the life. By yielding up the will to Christ, we ally\nourselves with divine power. We receive strength from above to hold\nus steadfast. A pure and noble life, a life of victory over appetite\nWorking for the Intemperate 115\nand lust, is possible to everyone who will unite his weak, wavering\nhuman will to the omnipotent, unwavering will of God.\nThose who are struggling against the power of appetite should be\ninstructed in the principles of healthful living. They should be shown\nthat violation of the laws of health, by creating diseased conditions\nand unnatural cravings, lays the foundation of the liquor habit. Only\nby living in obedience to the principles of health can they hope [177]\nto be freed from the craving for unnatural stimulants. While they\ndepend upon divine strength to break the bonds of appetite, they are\nto co-operate with God by obedience to His laws, both moral and\nphysical.\nThose who are endeavoring to reform should be provided with\nemployment. None who are able to labor should be taught to expect\nfood and clothing and shelter free of cost. For their own sake, as well\nas for the sake of others, some way should be devised whereby they\nmay return an equivalent for what they receive. Encourage every\neffort toward self-support. This will strengthen self-respect and a\nnoble independence. And occupation of mind and body in useful\nwork is essential as a safeguard against temptation.\nDisappointments; Dangers\nThose who work for the fallen will be disappointed in many who\ngive promise of reform. Many will make but a superficial change\nin their habits and practices. They are moved by impulse, and for\na time may seem to have reformed; but there is no real change of\nheart. They cherish the same self-love, have the same hungering for\nfoolish pleasures, the same desire for self-indulgence. They have not\na knowledge of the work of character building, and they cannot be\nrelied upon as men of principle. They have debased their mental and\nspiritual powers by the gratification of appetite and passion, and this\nmakes them weak. They are fickle and changeable. Their impulses\ntend toward sensuality. These persons are often a source of danger\nto others. Being looked upon as reformed men and women, they\nare trusted with responsibilities and are placed where their influence\ncorrupts the innocent.\nEven those who are sincerely seeking to reform are not beyond [178]\nthe danger of falling. They need to be treated with great wisdom as\n116 The Ministry of Healing\nwell as tenderness. The disposition to flatter and exalt those who\nhave been rescued from the lowest depths sometimes proves their\nruin. The practice of inviting men and women to relate in public\nthe experience of their life of sin is full of danger to both speaker\nand hearers. To dwell upon scenes of evil is corrupting to mind and\nsoul. And the prominence given to the rescued ones is harmful to\nthem. Many are led to feel that their sinful life has given them a\ncertain distinction. A love of notoriety and a spirit of self-trust are\nencouraged that prove fatal to the soul. Only in distrust of self and\ndependence on the mercy of Christ can they stand.\nAll who give evidence of true conversion should be encouraged\nto work for others. Let none turn away a soul who leaves the service\nof Satan for the service of Christ. When one gives evidence that the\nSpirit of God is striving with him, present every encouragement for\nentering the Lord\u2019s service. \u201cOf some have compassion, making a\ndifference.\u201d Jude 22. Those who are wise in the wisdom that comes\nfrom God will see souls in need of help, those who have sincerely\nrepented, but who without encouragement would hardly dare to lay\nhold of hope. The Lord will put it into the hearts of His servants to\nwelcome these trembling, repentant ones to their loving fellowship.\nWhatever may have been their besetting sins, however low they may\nhave fallen, when in contrition they come to Christ, He receives\nthem. Then give them something to do for Him. If they desire to\nlabor in uplifting others from the pit of destruction from which they\nthemselves were rescued, give them opportunity. Bring them into\nassociation with experienced Christians, that they may gain spiritual\nstrength. Fill their hearts and hands with work for the Master. [179]\nWhen light flashes into the soul, some who appeared to be most\nfully given to sin will become successful workers for just such sin-\nners as they themselves once were. Through faith in Christ some will\nrise to high places of service and be entrusted with responsibilities\nin the work of saving souls. They see where their own weakness lies,\nthey realize the depravity of their nature. They know the strength\nof sin, the power of evil habit. They realize their inability to over-\ncome without the help of Christ, and their constant cry is, \u201cI cast my\nhelpless soul on Thee.\u201d\nThese can help others. The one who has been tempted and tried,\nwhose hope was well-nigh gone, but who was saved by hearing\nWorking for the Intemperate 117\na message of love, can understand the science of soulsaving. He\nwhose heart is filled with love for Christ because he himself has\nbeen sought for by the Saviour and brought back to the fold, knows\nhow to seek the lost. He can point sinners to the Lamb of God. He\nhas given himself without reserve to God and has been accepted in\nthe Beloved. The hand that in weakness was held out for help has\nbeen grasped. By the ministry of such ones many prodigals will be\nbrought to the Father.\nFor every soul struggling to rise from a life of sin to a life of\npurity, the great element of power abides in the only \u201cname under\nheaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d Acts 4:12.\n\u201cIf any man thirst\u201d for restful hope, for deliverance from sinful\npropensities, Christ says, \u201clet him come unto Me, and drink.\u201d John\n7:37. The only remedy for vice is the grace and power of Christ.\nThe good resolutions made in one\u2019s own strength avail nothing.\nNot all the pledges in the world will break the power of evil habit.\nNever will men practice temperance in all things until their hearts [180]\nare renewed by divine grace. We cannot keep ourselves from sin for\none moment. Every moment we are dependent upon God.\nTrue reformation begins with soul cleansing. Our work for the\nfallen will achieve real success only as the grace of Christ reshapes\nthe character and the soul is brought into living connection with\nGod.\nChrist lived a life of perfect obedience to God\u2019s law, and in\nthis He set an example for every human being. The life that He\nlived in this world we are to live through His power and under His\ninstruction.\nIn our work for the fallen the claims of the law of God and\nthe need of loyalty to Him are to be impressed on mind and heart.\nNever fail to show that there is a marked difference between the\none who serves God and the one who serves Him not. God is love,\nbut He cannot excuse willful disregard for His commands. The\nenactments of His government are such that men do not escape the\nconsequences of disloyalty. Only those who honor Him can He\nhonor. Man\u2019s conduct in this world decides his eternal destiny. As\nhe has sown, so he must reap. Cause will be followed by effect.\nNothing less than perfect obedience can meet the standard of\nGod\u2019s requirement. He has not left His requirements indefinite. He\n118 The Ministry of Healing\nhas enjoined nothing that is not necessary in order to bring man into\nharmony with Him. We are to point sinners to His ideal of character\nand to lead them to Christ, by whose grace only can this ideal be\nreached.\nThe Saviour took upon Himself the infirmities of humanity and\nlived a sinless life, that men might have no fear that because of the\nweakness of human nature they could not overcome. Christ came to\nmake us \u201cpartakers of the divine nature,\u201d and His life declares that\nhumanity, combined with divinity, does not commit sin.\nThe Saviour overcame to show man how he may overcome.[181]\nAll the temptations of Satan, Christ met with the word of God.\nBy trusting in God\u2019s promises, He received power to obey God\u2019s\ncommandments, and the tempter could gain no advantage. To every\ntemptation His answer was, \u201cIt is written.\u201d So God has given us\nHis word wherewith to resist evil. Exceeding great and precious\npromises are ours, that by these we \u201cmight be partakers of the divine\nnature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through\nlust.\u201d 2 Peter 1:4.\nBid the tempted one look not to circumstances, to the weakness\nof self, or to the power of temptation, but to the power of God\u2019s\nword. All its strength is ours. \u201cThy word,\u201d says the psalmist, \u201chave\nI hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.\u201d \u201cBy the word\nof Thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.\u201d Psalm\n119:11; 17:4.\nTalk courage to the people; lift them up to God in prayer. Many\nwho have been overcome by temptation are humiliated by their\nfailures, and they feel that it is in vain for them to approach unto\nGod; but this thought is of the enemy\u2019s suggestion. When they have\nsinned, and feel that they cannot pray, tell them that it is then the\ntime to pray. Ashamed they may be, and deeply humbled; but as\nthey confess their sins, He who is faithful and just will forgive their[182]\nsins and cleanse them from all unrighteousness.\nNothing is apparently more helpless, yet really more invincible,\nthan the soul that feels its nothingness and relies wholly on the\nmerits of the Saviour. By prayer, by the study of His word, by faith\nin His abiding presence, the weakest of human beings may live in\ncontact with the living Christ, and He will hold them by a hand that\nwill never let go.\nWorking for the Intemperate 119\nThese precious words every soul that abides in Christ may make\nhis own. He may say:\n\u201cI will look unto the Lord;\nI will wait for the God of my salvation:\nMy God will hear me.\nRejoice not against me, O mine enemy:\nWhen I fall, I shall arise;\nWhen I sit in darkness,\nThe Lord shall be a light unto me.\u201d\nMicah 7:7, 8.\n\u201cHe will again have compassion on us,\nHe will blot out our iniquities;\nYea, Thou wilt cast all our sins into the depths of the sea!\u201d\nMicah 7:19, Noyes.\nGod has promised:\n\u201cI will make a man more precious than fine gold;\nEven a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.\u201d\nIsaiah 13:12.\n\u201cThough ye have lain among the pots,\nYet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver,\nAnd her feathers with yellow gold.\u201d\nPsalm 68:13.\nThose whom Christ has forgiven most will love Him most. These\nare they who in the final day will stand nearest to His throne.\n\u201cThey shall see His face; and His name shall be in their fore-\nheads.\u201d Revelation 22:4.\nChapter 12\u2014Help for the Unemployed and the[183]\nHomeless\nThere are largehearted men and women who are anxiously con-\nsidering the condition of the poor and what means can be found for\ntheir relief. How the unemployed and the homeless can be helped\nto secure the common blessings of God\u2019s providence and to live\nthe life He intended man to live, is a question to which many are\nearnestly endeavoring to find an answer. But there are not many,\neven among educators and statesmen, who comprehend the causes\nthat underlie the present state of society. Those who hold the reins of\ngovernment are unable to solve the problem of poverty, pauperism,\nand increasing crime. They are struggling in vain to place business\noperations on a more secure basis.\nIf men would give more heed to the teaching of God\u2019s word, they\nwould find a solution of these problems that perplex them. Much\nmight be learned from the Old Testament in regard to the labor\nquestion and the relief of the poor.\nGod\u2019s Plan for Israel\nIn God\u2019s plan for Israel every family had a home on the land,\nwith sufficient ground for tilling. Thus were provided both the means[184]\nand the incentive for a useful, industrious, and self-supporting life.\nAnd no devising of men has ever improved upon that plan. To the\nworld\u2019s departure from it is owing, to a large degree, the poverty and\nwretchedness that exist today.\nAt the settlement of Israel in Canaan, the land was divided among\nthe whole people, the Levites only, as ministers of the sanctuary,\nbeing excepted from the equal distribution. The tribes were num-\nbered by families, and to each family, according to its numbers, was\napportioned an inheritance.\nAnd although one might for a time dispose of his possession, he\ncould not permanently barter away the inheritance of his children.\n120\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 121\nWhen able to redeem his land, he was at liberty at any time to do so.\nDebts were remitted every seventh year, and in the fiftieth, or year\nof jubilee, all landed property reverted to the original owner.\n\u201cThe land shall not be sold forever,\u201d was the Lord\u2019s direction;\n\u201cfor the land is Mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with Me.\nAnd in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption\nfor the land. If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some [185]\nof his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall\nhe redeem that which his brother sold. And if the man ... himself be\nable to redeem it; ... he may return unto his possession. But if he\nbe not able to restore it to him, then that which is sold shall remain\nin the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee.\u201d\nLeviticus 25:23-28.\n\u201cYe shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout\nall the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto\nyou; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall\nreturn every man unto his family.\u201d Verse 10.\nThus every family was secured in its possession, and a safeguard\nwas afforded against the extremes of either wealth or want.\nIndustrial Training\nIn Israel, industrial training was regarded as a duty. Every father\nwas required to teach his sons some useful trade. The greatest men in [186]\nIsrael were trained to industrial pursuits. A knowledge of the duties\npertaining to housewifery was considered essential for every woman.\nAnd skill in these duties was regarded as an honor to women of the\nhighest station.\nVarious industries were taught in the schools of the prophets,\nand many of the students sustained themselves by manual labor.\nConsideration for the Poor\nThese arrangements did not, however, wholly do away with\npoverty. It was not God\u2019s purpose that poverty should wholly cease.\nIt is one of His means for the development of character. \u201cThe poor,\u201d\nHe says, \u201cshall never cease out of the land: therefore I command\n122 The Ministry of Healing\nthee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to\nthy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.\u201d Deuteronomy 15:11.\n\u201cIf there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within\nany of thy gates in thy land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,\nthou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor\nbrother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt\nsurely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.\u201d\nVerses 7, 8.\n\u201cIf thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then\nthou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a sojourner;\nthat he may live with thee.\u201d Leviticus 25:35.\n\u201cWhen ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly\nreap the corners of thy field.\u201d \u201cWhen thou cuttest down thine harvest\nin thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go\nagain to fetch it.... When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not\ngo over the boughs again.... When thou gatherest the grapes of thy\nvineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger,\nfor the fatherless, and for the widow.\u201d Leviticus 19:9; Deuteronomy\n24:19-21.\nNone need fear that their liberality would bring them to want.[187]\nObedience to God\u2019s commandments would surely result in prosper-\nity. \u201cFor this thing,\u201d God said, \u201cthe Lord thy God shall bless thee in\nall thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto.\u201d \u201cThou\nshalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou\nshalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 15:10, 6.\nBusiness Principles\nGod\u2019s word sanctions no policy that will enrich one class by the\noppression and suffering of another. In all our business transactions\nit teaches us to put ourselves in the place of those with whom we are\ndealing, to look not only on our own things, but also on the things\nof others. He who would take advantage of another\u2019s misfortunes\nin order to benefit himself, or who seeks to profit himself through\nanother\u2019s weakness or incompetence, is a transgressor both of the\nprinciples and of the precepts of the word of God.\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 123\n\u201cThou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the\nfatherless; nor take a widow\u2019s raiment to pledge.\u201d \u201cWhen thou dost\nlend thy brother anything, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch\nhis pledge. Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost\nlend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee. And if the man be\npoor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge.\u201d \u201cIf thou at all take thy [188]\nneighbor\u2019s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that\nthe sun goeth down: for that is his covering only: ... wherein shall\nhe sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I\nwill hear; for I am gracious.\u201d \u201cIf thou sell aught unto thy neighbor,\nor buyest aught of thy neighbor\u2019s hand, ye shall not oppress one\nanother\u201d Deuteronomy 24:17, 10-12; Exodus 22:26, 27; Leviticus\n25:14.\n\u201cYe shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of\nlength, of weight, or of quantity.\u201d \u201cThou shalt not have in thy bag\ndiverse weights, a great and a small. Thou shalt not have in thy\nhouse diverse measures, a great and a small.\u201d \u201cJust balances, just\nweights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have.\u201d Leviticus 19:35,\nA.R.V .; Deuteronomy 25:13, 14, A.R.V .; Leviticus 19:36, A.R.V .\n\u201cGive to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow\nof thee turn not thou away.\u201d \u201cThe wicked borroweth, and payeth not\nagain: but the righteous showeth mercy, and giveth.\u201d Matthew 5:42;\nPsalm 37:21.\n\u201cGive counsel, execute justice; make thy shade as the night in\nthe midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.\u201d\n\u201cLet Mine outcasts dwell with thee; ... be thou a covert to them from\nthe face of the spoiler.\u201d Isaiah 16:3 (A.R.V .), 4.\nThe plan of life that God gave to Israel was intended as an object\nlesson for all mankind. If these principles were carried out today,\nwhat a different place this world would be!\nWithin the vast boundaries of nature there is still room for the\nsuffering and needy to find a home. Within her bosom there are\nresources sufficient to provide them with food. Hidden in the depths\nof the earth are blessings for all who have courage and will and\nperseverance to gather her treasures.\nThe tilling of the soil, the employment that God appointed to man [189]\nin Eden, opens a field in which there is opportunity for multitudes\nto gain a subsistence.\n124 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cTrust in the Lord, and do good;\nSo shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou\nshalt be fed.\u201d\nPsalm 37:3.\nThousands and tens of thousands might be working upon the\nsoil who are crowded into the cities, watching for a chance to earn a\ntrifle. In many cases this trifle is not spent for bread, but is put into\nthe till of the liquor seller, to obtain that which destroys soul and\nbody.\nMany look upon labor as drudgery, and they try to obtain a\nlivelihood by scheming rather than by honest toil. This desire to get\na living without work opens the door to wretchedness and vice and\ncrime almost without limit.\nThe City Slums\nIn the great cities are multitudes who receive less care and con-\nsideration than are given to dumb animals. Think of the families\nherded together in miserable tenements, many of them dark base-\nments, reeking with dampness and filth. In these wretched places[190]\nchildren are born and grow up and die. They see nothing of the\nbeauty of natural things that God has created to delight the senses\nand uplift the soul. Ragged and half-starved, they live amid vice\nand depravity, molded in character by the wretchedness and sin that\nsurround them. Children hear the name of God only in profanity.\nFoul speech, imprecations, and revilings fill their ears. The fumes of\nliquor and tobacco, sickening stenches, moral degradation, pervert\ntheir senses. Thus multitudes are trained to become criminals, foes\nto society that has abandoned them to misery and degradation.\nNot all the poor in the city slums are of this class. God-fearing\nmen and women have been brought to the depths of poverty by illness\nor misfortune, often through the dishonest scheming of those who\nlive by preying upon their fellows. Many who are upright and well-\nmeaning become poor through lack of industrial training. Through\nignorance they are unfitted to wrestle with the difficulties of life.\nDrifting into the cities, they are often unable to find employment.\nSurrounded by the sights and sounds of vice, they are subjected to\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 125\nterrible temptation. Herded and often classed with the vicious and\ndegraded, it is only by a superhuman struggle, a more than finite\npower, that they can be preserved from sinking to the same depths.\nMany hold fast their integrity, choosing to suffer rather than to sin.\nThis class especially demand help, sympathy, and encouragement.\nIf the poor now crowded into the cities could find homes upon\nthe land, they might not only earn a livelihood, but find health and\nhappiness now unknown to them. Hard work, simple fare, close\neconomy, often hardship and privation, would be their lot. But what\na blessing would be theirs in leaving the city, with its enticements\nto evil, its turmoil and crime, misery and foulness, for the country\u2019s [191]\nquiet and peace and purity.\nTo many of those living in the cities who have not a spot of green\ngrass to set their feet upon, who year after year have looked out [192]\nupon filthy courts and narrow alleys, brick walls and pavements, and\nskies clouded with dust and smoke\u2014if these could be taken to some\nfarming district, surrounded with the green fields, the woods and\nhills and brooks, the clear skies and the fresh, pure air of the country,\nit would seem almost like heaven.\nCut off to a great degree from contact with and dependence\nupon men, and separated from the world\u2019s corrupting maxims and\ncustoms and excitements, they would come nearer to the heart of\nnature. God\u2019s presence would be more real to them. Many would\nlearn the lesson of dependence upon Him. Through nature they\nwould hear His voice speaking to their hearts of His peace and love,\nand mind and soul and body would respond to the healing, life-giving\npower.\nIf they ever become industrious and self-supporting, very many\nmust have assistance, encouragement, and instruction. There are\nmultitudes of poor families for whom no better missionary work\ncould be done than to assist them in settling on the land and in\nlearning how to make it yield them a livelihood.\nThe need for such help and instruction is not confined to the\ncities. Even in the country, with all its possibilities for a better life,\nmultitudes of the poor are in great need. Whole communities are\ndevoid of education in industrial and sanitary lines. Families live\nin hovels, with scant furniture and clothing, without tools, without\nbooks, destitute both of comforts and conveniences and of means\n126 The Ministry of Healing\nof culture. Imbruted souls, bodies weak and ill-formed, reveal the\nresults of evil heredity and of wrong habits. These people must be\neducated from the very foundation. They have led shiftless, idle,\ncorrupt lives, and they need to be trained to correct habits.\nHow can they be awakened to the necessity of improvement?[193]\nHow can they be directed to a higher ideal of life? How can they be\nhelped to rise? What can be done where poverty prevails and is to\nbe contended with at every step? Certainly the work is difficult. The\nnecessary reformation will never be made unless men and women\nare assisted by a power outside of themselves. It is God\u2019s purpose\nthat the rich and the poor shall be closely bound together by the ties\nof sympathy and helpfulness. Those who have means, talents, and\ncapabilities are to use these gifts in blessing their fellow men.\nChristian farmers can do real missionary work in helping the\npoor to find homes on the land and in teaching them how to till the\nsoil and make it productive. Teach them how to use the implements\nof agriculture, how to cultivate various crops, how to plant and care\nfor orchards.\nMany who till the soil fail to secure adequate returns because of\ntheir neglect. Their orchards are not properly cared for, the crops are\nnot put in at the right time, and a mere surface work is done in culti-\nvating the soil. Their ill success they charge to the unproductiveness\nof the land. False witness is often borne in condemning land that,\nif properly worked, would yield rich returns. The narrow plans, the\nlittle strength put forth, the little study as to the best methods, call\nloudly for reform.\nLet proper methods be taught to all who are willing to learn.\nIf any do not wish you to speak to them of advanced ideas, let the\nlessons be given silently. Keep up the culture of your own land.\nDrop a word to your neighbors when you can, and let the harvest be\neloquent in favor of right methods. Demonstrate what can be done\nwith the land when properly worked.\nAttention should be given to the establishment of various in-[194]\ndustries so that poor families can find employment. Carpenters,\nblacksmiths, and indeed everyone who understands some line of\nuseful labor, should feel a responsibility to teach and help the igno-\nrant and the unemployed.\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 127\nIn ministry to the poor there is a wide field of service for women\nas well as for men. The efficient cook, the housekeeper, the seam-\nstress, the nurse\u2014the help of all is needed. Let the members of poor\nhouseholds be taught how to cook, how to make and mend their\nown clothing, how to nurse the sick, how to care properly for the\nhome. Let boys and girls be thoroughly taught some useful trade or\noccupation.\nMissionary Families\nMissionary families are needed to settle in the waste places. Let\nfarmers, financiers, builders, and those who are skilled in various arts\nand crafts, go to neglected fields, to improve the land, to establish\nindustries, to prepare humble homes for themselves, and to help\ntheir neighbors.\nThe rough places of nature, the wild places, God has made\nattractive by placing beautiful things among the most unsightly.\nThis is the work we are called to do. Even the desert places of the\nearth, where the outlook appears to be forbidding, may become as\nthe garden of God. \u201cIn that day shall the deaf hear the words of the\nbook, And the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of\ndarkness. The meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, And\nthe poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.\u201d Isaiah\n29:18, 19.\nBy instruction in practical lines we can often help the poor most\neffectively. As a rule, those who have not been trained to work\ndo not have habits of industry, perseverance, economy, and self- [195]\ndenial. They do not know how to manage. Often through lack of\ncarefulness and right judgment there is wasted that which would\nmaintain their families in decency and comfort if it were carefully\nand economically used. \u201cMuch food is in the tillage of the poor: but\nthere is that is destroyed for want of judgment.\u201d Proverbs 13:23.\nWe may give to the poor, and harm them, by teaching them to\nbe dependent. Such giving encourages selfishness and helplessness.\nOften it leads to idleness, extravagance, and intemperance. No man\nwho can earn his own livelihood has a right to depend on others.\nThe proverb \u201cThe world owes me a living\u201d has in it the essence of\n128 The Ministry of Healing\nfalsehood, fraud, and robbery. The world owes no man a living who\nis able to work and gain a living for himself.\nReal charity helps men to help themselves. If one comes to our\ndoor and asks for food, we should not turn him away hungry; his\npoverty may be the result of misfortune. But true beneficence means\nmore than mere gifts. It means a genuine interest in the welfare\nof others. We should seek to understand the needs of the poor and\ndistressed, and to give them the help that will benefit them most. To\ngive thought and time and personal effort costs far more than merely\nto give money. But it is the truest charity.\nThose who are taught to earn what they receive will more readily\nlearn to make the most of it. And in learning to be self-reliant, they\nare acquiring that which will not only make them self-sustaining, but\nwill enable them to help others. Teach the importance of life\u2019s duties\nto those who are wasting their opportunities. Show them that Bible\nreligion never makes men idlers. Christ always encouraged industry.\n\u201cWhy stand ye here all the day idle?\u201d He said to the indolent. \u201cI\nmust work ... while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can\nwork.\u201d Matthew 20:6; John 9:4.\nIt is the privilege of all to give to the world in their home life,[196]\nin their customs and practices and order, an evidence of what the\ngospel can do for those who obey it. Christ came to our world to give\nus an example of what we may become. He expects His followers\nto be models of correctness in all the relations of life. He desires the\ndivine touch to be seen upon outward things.\nOur own homes and surroundings should be object lessons,\nteaching ways of improvement, so that industry, cleanliness, taste,\nand refinement may take the place of idleness, uncleanness, coarse-\nness, and disorder. By our lives and example we can help others to\ndiscern that which is repulsive in their character or their surround-\nings, and with Christian courtesy we may encourage improvement.\nAs we manifest an interest in them, we shall find opportunity to\nteach them how to put their energies to the best use.\nHope and Courage\nWe can do nothing without courage and perseverance. Speak\nwords of hope and courage to the poor and the disheartened. If\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 129\nneed be, give tangible proof of your interest by helping them when\nthey come into strait places. Those who have had many advantages\nshould remember that they themselves still err in many things, and\nthat it is painful to them when their errors are pointed out and there\nis held up before them a comely pattern of what they should be.\nRemember that kindness will accomplish more than censure. As\nyou try to teach others, let them see that you wish them to reach\nthe highest standard, and that you are ready to give them help. If in\nsome things they fail, be not quick to condemn them.\nSimplicity, self-denial, economy, lessons so essential for the poor\nto learn, often seem to them difficult and unwelcome. The example [197]\nand spirit of the world is constantly exciting and fostering pride, love\nof display, self-indulgence, prodigality, and idleness. These evils\nbring thousands to penury and prevent thousands more from rising\nout of degradation and wretchedness. Christians are to encourage\nthe poor to resist these influences.\nJesus came to this world in humility. He was of lowly birth. The\nMajesty of heaven, the King of glory, the Commander of all the\nangel host, He humbled Himself to accept humanity, and then He\nchose a life of poverty and humiliation. He had no opportunities\nthat the poor do not have. Toil, hardship, and privation were a part\nof every day\u2019s experience. \u201cFoxes have holes,\u201d He said, \u201cand birds\nof the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay His\nhead.\u201d Luke 9:58.\nJesus did not seek the admiration or the applause of men. He\ncommanded no army. He ruled no earthly kingdom. He did not\ncourt the favor of the wealthy and honored of the world. He did not\nclaim a position among the leaders of the nation. He dwelt among\nthe lowly. He set at nought the artificial distinctions of society. The\naristocracy of birth, wealth, talent, learning, rank, He ignored.\nHe was the Prince of heaven, yet He did not choose His dis-\nciples from among the learned lawyers, the rulers, the scribes, or\nthe Pharisees. He passed these by, because they prided themselves\non their learning and position. They were fixed in their traditions\nand superstitions. He who could read all hearts chose humble fish-\nermen who were willing to be taught. He ate with publicans and\nsinners, and mingled with the common people, not to become low\nand earthly with them, but in order by precept and example to present\n130 The Ministry of Healing\nto them right principles, and to uplift them from their earthliness\nand debasement.\nJesus sought to correct the world\u2019s false standard of judging the\nvalue of men. He took His position with the poor, that He might lift[198]\nfrom poverty the stigma that the world had attached to it. He has\nstripped from it forever the reproach of scorn, by blessing the poor,\nthe inheritors of God\u2019s kingdom. He points us to the path He trod,\nsaying, \u201cIf any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and\ntake up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d Verse 23.\nChristian workers are to meet the people where they are, and\neducate them, not in pride, but in character building. Teach them\nhow Christ worked and denied Himself. Help them to learn from\nHim the lessons of self-denial and sacrifice. Teach them to beware\nof self-indulgence in conforming to fashion. Life is too valuable,\ntoo full of solemn, sacred responsibilities, to be wasted in pleasing\nself.\nLife\u2019s Best Things\nMen and women have hardly begun to understand the true object\nof life. They are attracted by glitter and show. They are ambitious\nfor worldly pre-eminence. To this the true aims of life are sacri-\nficed. Life\u2019s best things\u2014simplicity, honesty, truthfulness, purity,\nintegrity\u2014cannot be bought or sold. They are as free to the ignorant\nas to the educated, to the humble laborer as to the honored statesman.\nFor everyone God has provided pleasure that may be enjoyed by\nrich and poor alike\u2014the pleasure found in cultivating pureness of\nthought and unselfishness of action, the pleasure that comes from\nspeaking sympathizing words and doing kindly deeds. From those\nwho perform such service the light of Christ shines to brighten lives\ndarkened by many shadows.\nWhile helping the poor in temporal things, keep always in view\ntheir spiritual needs. Let your own life testify to the Saviour\u2019s keep-\ning power. Let your character reveal the high standard to which all\nmay attain. Teach the gospel in simple object lessons. Let everything[199]\nwith which you have to do be a lesson in character building.\nIn the humble round of toil, the very weakest, the most obscure,\nmay be workers together with God and may have the comfort of His\nHelp for the Unemployed and the Homeless 131\npresence and sustaining grace. They are not to weary themselves\nwith busy anxieties and needless cares. Let them work on from\nday to day, accomplishing faithfully the task that God\u2019s providence\nassigns, and He will care for them. He says:\n\u201cIn nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and sup-\nplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto\nGod.\u201d \u201cAnd the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall\nkeep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.\u201d Philippians 4:6,",

      "text": "The Lord\u2019s care is over all His creatures. He loves them all and\nmakes no difference, except that He has the most tender pity for\nthose who are called to bear life\u2019s heaviest burdens. God\u2019s children\nmust meet trials and difficulties. But they should accept their lot with\na cheerful spirit, remembering that for all that the world neglects to\nbestow, God Himself will make up to them in the best of favors.\nIt is when we come into difficult places that He reveals His power\nand wisdom in answer to humble prayer. Have confidence in Him\nas a prayer-hearing, prayer-answering God. He will reveal Himself\nto you as One who can help in every emergency. He who created\nman, who gave him his wonderful physical, mental, and spiritual\nfaculties, will not withhold that which is necessary to sustain the life\nHe has given. He who has given us His word\u2014the leaves of the tree\nof life\u2014will not withhold from us a knowledge of how to provide\nfood for His needy children.\nHow can wisdom be obtained by him who holds the plow and\ndrives the oxen? By seeking her as silver, and searching for her as\nfor hid treasure. \u201cFor his God doth instruct him to discretion, and\ndoth teach him.\u201d Isaiah 28:26. \u201cThis also cometh forth from Jehovah [200]\nof hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.\u201d\nVerse 29, A.R.V .\nHe who taught Adam and Eve in Eden how to tend the garden,\ndesires to instruct men today. There is wisdom for him who drives\nthe plow and sows the seed. Before those who trust and obey Him,\nGod will open ways of advance. Let them move forward coura-\ngeously, trusting in Him to supply their needs according to the riches\nof His goodness.\nHe who fed the multitude with five loaves and two small fishes\nis able today to give us the fruit of our labor. He who said to the\n132 The Ministry of Healing\nfishers of Galilee, \u201cLet down your nets for a draft,\u201d and who, as they\nobeyed, filled their nets till they broke, desires His people to see in\nthis an evidence of what He will do for them today. The God who\nin the wilderness gave the children of Israel manna from heaven\nstill lives and reigns. He will guide His people and give skill and\nunderstanding in the work they are called to do. He will give wisdom\nto those who strive to do their duty conscientiously and intelligently.\nHe who owns the world is rich in resources, and will bless everyone\nwho is seeking to bless others.\nWe need to look heavenward in faith. We are not to be discour-\naged because of apparent failure, nor should we be disheartened by\ndelay. We should work cheerfully, hopefully, gratefully, believing\nthat the earth holds in her bosom rich treasures for the faithful worker\nto garner, stores richer than gold or silver. The mountains and hills\nare changing; the earth is waxing old like a garment; but the blessing\nof God, which spreads for His people a table in the wilderness, will\nnever cease.\nChapter 13\u2014The Helpless Poor [201]\nWhen all has been done that can be done in helping the poor to\nhelp themselves, there still remain the widow and the fatherless, the\naged, the helpless, and the sick, that claim sympathy and care. Never\nshould these be neglected. They are committed by God Himself to\nthe mercy, the love, and the tender care of all whom He has made\nHis stewards.\nThe Household of Faith\n\u201cAs we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men,\nespecially unto them who are of the household of faith.\u201d Galatians\n6:10.\nIn a special sense, Christ has laid upon His church the duty\nof caring for the needy among its own members. He suffers His\npoor to be in the borders of every church. They are always to be\namong us, and He places upon the members of the church a personal\nresponsibility to care for them.\nAs the members of a true family care for one another, ministering\nto the sick, supporting the weak, teaching the ignorant, training the\ninexperienced, so is \u201cthe household of faith\u201d to care for its needy\nand helpless ones. Upon no consideration are these to be passed by.\nWidows and Orphans [202]\nThe widow and the fatherless are the objects of the Lord\u2019s special\ncare.\n\u201cA Father of the fatherless, and a Judge of the widows,\nIs God in His holy habitation.\u201d\n\u201cThy Maker is thy husband;\nJehovah of hosts is His name:\nAnd the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer;\n133\n134 The Ministry of Healing\nThe God of the whole earth shall He be called.\u201d\n\u201cLeave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive;\nAnd let thy widows trust in Me.\u201d\nPsalm 68:5; Isaiah 54:5,\nA.R.V .; Jeremiah 49:11.\nMany a father, when called upon to part from his loved ones,\nhas died resting in faith upon God\u2019s promise to care for them. The\nLord provides for the widow and the fatherless, not by a miracle in\nsending manna from heaven, not by sending ravens to bring them\nfood; but by a miracle upon human hearts, expelling selfishness,\nand unsealing the fountains of Christlike love. The afflicted and\nbereaved ones He commits to His followers as a precious trust. They\nhave the very strongest claim upon our sympathy.\nIn homes supplied with life\u2019s comforts, in bins and granaries\nfilled with the yield of abundant harvests, in warehouses stocked\nwith the products of the loom, and vaults stored with gold and silver,\nGod has supplied means for the sustenance of these needy ones. He\ncalls upon us to be channels of His bounty.\nMany a widowed mother with her fatherless children is bravely[203]\nstriving to bear her double burden, often toiling far beyond her\nstrength in order to keep her little ones with her and to provide for\ntheir needs. Little time has she for their training and instruction, little\nopportunity to surround them with influences that would brighten\ntheir lives. She needs encouragement, sympathy, and tangible help.\nGod calls upon us to supply to these children, so far as we can,\nthe want of a father\u2019s care. Instead of standing aloof, complaining\nof their faults, and of the trouble they may cause, help them in every\nway possible. Seek to aid the careworn mother. Lighten her burdens.\nThen there are the multitudes of children who have been wholly\ndeprived of the guidance of parents and the subduing influence of\na Christian home. Let Christians open their hearts and homes to\nthese helpless ones. The work that God has committed to them as\nan individual duty should not be turned over to some benevolent\ninstitution or left to the chances of the world\u2019s charity. If the children\nhave no relatives able to give them care, let the members of the\nchurch provide homes for them. He who made us ordained that we\nHelpless Poor 135\nshould be associated in families, and the child nature will develop\nbest in the loving atmosphere of a Christian home.\nMany who have no children of their own could do a good work\nin caring for the children of others. Instead of giving attention to\npets, lavishing affection upon dumb animals, let them give their\nattention to little children, whose characters they may fashion after\nthe divine similitude. Place your love upon the homeless members\nof the human family. See how many of these children you can bring [204]\nup in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Many would thus be\ngreatly benefited themselves.\nThe Aged\nThe aged also need the helpful influences of the family. In the\nhome of brethren and sisters in Christ can most nearly be made up\nto them the loss of their own home. If encouraged to share in the\ninterests and occupations of the household, it will help them to feel\nthat their usefulness is not at an end. Make them feel that their help\nis valued, that there is something yet for them to do in ministering to\nothers, and it will cheer their hearts and give interest to their lives.\nSo far as possible let those whose whitening heads and failing\nsteps show that they are drawing near to the grave remain among\nfriends and familiar associations. Let them worship among those\nwhom they have known and loved. Let them be cared for by loving\nand tender hands.\nWhenever they are able to do so, it should be the privilege of the\nmembers of every family to minister to their own kindred. When this\ncannot be, the work belongs to the church, and it should be accepted\nboth as a privilege and as a duty. All who possess Christ\u2019s spirit will\nhave a tender regard for the feeble and the aged.\nThe presence in our homes of one of these helpless ones is a\nprecious opportunity to co-operate with Christ in His ministry of\nmercy and to develop traits of character like His. There is a blessing\nin the association of the old and the young. The young may bring\nsunshine into the hearts and lives of the aged. Those whose hold on\nlife is weakening need the benefit of contact with the hopefulness and\nbuoyancy of youth. And the young may be helped by the wisdom\nand experience of the old. Above all, they need to learn the lesson\n136 The Ministry of Healing\nof unselfish ministry. The presence of one in need of sympathy and[205]\nforbearance and self-sacrificing love would be to many a household\na priceless blessing. It would sweeten and refine the home life, and\ncall forth in old and young those Christlike graces that would make\nthem beautiful with a divine beauty and rich in heaven\u2019s imperishable\ntreasure.\nA Test of Character\n\u201cYe have the poor with you always,\u201d Christ said, \u201cand whenso-\never ye will ye may do them good.\u201d \u201cPure religion and undefiled\nbefore God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows\nin their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\u201d\nMark 14:7; James 1:27.\nIn placing among them the helpless and the poor, to be dependent\nupon their care, Christ tests His professed followers. By our love\nand service for His needy children we prove the genuineness of our\nlove for Him. To neglect them is to declare ourselves false disciples,\nstrangers to Christ and His love.\nIf all were done that could be done in providing homes in families\nfor orphan children, there would still remain very many requiring\ncare. Many of them have received an inheritance of evil. They are\nunpromising, unattractive, perverse, but they are the purchase of\nthe blood of Christ, and in His sight are just as precious as are our\nown little ones. Unless a helping hand is held out to them, they will\ngrow up in ignorance and drift into vice and crime. Many of these\nchildren could be rescued through the work of orphan asylums.\nSuch institutions, to be most effective, should be modeled as\nclosely as possible after the plan of a Christian home. Instead of\nlarge establishments, bringing great numbers together, let there be\nsmall institutions in different places. Instead of being in or near[206]\nsome town or large city, they should be in the country where land\ncan be secured for cultivation and the children can be brought into\ncontact with nature and can have the benefits of industrial training.\nThose in charge of such a home should be men and women who\nare largehearted, cultured, and self-sacrificing; men and women who\nundertake the work from love to Christ and who train the children\nfor Him. Under such care many homeless and neglected ones may\nHelpless Poor 137\nbe prepared to become useful members of society, an honor to Christ\nthemselves, and in their turn helping others.\nMany despise economy, confounding it with stinginess and nar-\nrowness. But economy is consistent with the broadest liberality.\nIndeed, without economy, there can be no true liberality. We are to\nsave, that we may give.\nNo one can practice real benevolence without self-denial. Only\nby a life of simplicity, self-denial, and close economy is it possible\nfor us to accomplish the work appointed us as Christ\u2019s representa-\ntives. Pride and worldly ambition must be put out of our hearts. In\nall our work the principle of unselfishness revealed in Christ\u2019s life\nis to be carried out. Upon the walls of our homes, the pictures, the\nfurnishings, we are to read, \u201cBring the poor that are cast out to thy\nhouse.\u201d On our wardrobes we are to see written, as with the finger of\nGod, \u201cClothe the naked.\u201d In the dining room, on the table laden with\nabundant food, we should see traced, \u201cIs it not to deal thy bread to\nthe hungry?\u201d Isaiah 58:7.\nA thousand doors of usefulness are open before us. Often we\nlament the scanty resources available, but were Christians thoroughly\nin earnest, they could multiply the resources a thousandfold. It is\nselfishness, self-indulgence, that bars the way to our usefulness.\nHow much means is expended for things that are mere idols, [207]\nthings that engross thought and time and strength which should be\nput to a higher use! How much money is wasted on expensive houses\nand furniture, on selfish pleasures, luxurious and unwholesome food,\nhurtful indulgences! How much is squandered on gifts that benefit no\none! For things that are needless, often harmful, professed Christians\nare today spending more, many times more, than they spend in\nseeking to rescue souls from the tempter.\nMany who profess to be Christians spend so much on dress that\nthey have nothing to spare for the needs of others. Costly ornaments\nand expensive clothing they think they must have, regardless of the\nneeds of those who can with difficulty provide themselves with even\nthe plainest clothing.\nMy sisters, if you would bring your manner of dressing into\nconformity with the rules given in the Bible, you would have an\nabundance with which to help your poorer sisters. You would have\nnot only means, but time. Often this is most needed. There are many\n138 The Ministry of Healing\nwhom you might help with your suggestions, your tact and skill.\nShow them how to dress simply and yet tastefully. Many a woman\nremains away from the house of God because her shabby, ill-fitting\ngarments are in such striking contrast to the dress of others. Many a\nsensitive spirit cherishes a sense of bitter humiliation and injustice\nbecause of this contrast. And because of it many are led to doubt the\nreality of religion and to harden their hearts against the gospel.\nChrist bids us, \u201cGather up the fragments that remain, that nothing\nbe lost.\u201d While thousands are every day perishing from famine,\nbloodshed, fire, and plague, it becomes every lover of his kind to see\nthat nothing is wasted, that nothing is needlessly expended, whereby\nhe might benefit a human being.\nIt is wrong to waste our time, wrong to waste our thoughts.[208]\nWe lose every moment that we devote to self-seeking. If every\nmoment were valued and rightly employed, we should have time for\neverything that we need to do for ourselves or for the world. In the\nexpenditure of money, in the use of time, strength, opportunities,\nlet every Christian look to God for guidance. \u201cIf any of you lack\nwisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and\nupbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d James 1:5.\n\u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you\u201d\n\u201cDo good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward\nshall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for He is\nkind unto the unthankful and to the evil.\u201d Luke 6:35.\n\u201cHe that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse;\u201d but \u201che that\ngiveth unto the poor shall not lack.\u201d Proverbs 28:27.\n\u201cGive, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed\ndown, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into\nyour bosom.\u201d Luke 6:38.\nChapter 14\u2014Ministry to the Rich [209]\nCornelius, the Roman centurion, was a man of wealth and of\nnoble birth. His position was one of trust and honor. A heathen\nby birth, training, and education, through contact with the Jews he\nhad gained a knowledge of the true God, and he worshiped Him,\nshowing the sincerity of his faith by compassion to the poor. He\ngave \u201calms to the people, and prayed to God always.\u201d Acts 10:2,",

      "text": "Cornelius had not a knowledge of the gospel as revealed in the\nlife and death of Christ, and God sent a message direct from heaven\nto him, and by another message directed the apostle Peter to visit\nand instruct him. Cornelius was not united with the Jewish church,\nand he would have been looked upon by the rabbis as a heathen and\nunclean; but God read the sincerity of his heart, and sent messengers\nfrom His throne to unite with His servant on earth in teaching the\ngospel to this officer of Rome.\nSo today God is seeking for souls among the high as well as\nthe low. There are many like Cornelius, men whom He desires\nto connect with His church. Their sympathies are with the Lord\u2019s\npeople. But the ties that bind them to the world hold them firmly. It\nrequires moral courage for these men to take their position with the\nlowly ones. Special effort should be made for these souls, who are [210]\nin so great danger because of their responsibilities and associations.\nMuch is said concerning our duty to the neglected poor; should\nnot some attention be given to the neglected rich? Many look upon\nthis class as hopeless, and they do little to open the eyes of those,\nwho, blinded and dazed by the glitter of earthly glory, have lost\neternity out of their reckoning. Thousands of wealthy men have gone\nto their graves unwarned. But indifferent as they may appear, many\namong the rich are soul-burdened. \u201cHe that loveth silver shall not\nbe satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase.\u201d\nHe that says to fine gold, \u201cThou art my confidence,\u201d has \u201cdenied the\nGod that is above.\u201d \u201cNone of them can by any means redeem his\n139\n140 The Ministry of Healing\nbrother, nor give to God a ransom for him: (For the redemption of\ntheir soul is precious, and it ceaseth forever).\u201d Ecclesiastes 5:10; Job\n31:24, 28; Psalm 49:7, 8.\nRiches and worldly honor cannot satisfy the soul. Many among\nthe rich are longing for some divine assurance, some spiritual hope.\nMany long for something that will bring to an end the monotony of\ntheir aimless lives. Many in official life feel their need of something\nwhich they have not. Few among them go to church; for they feel\nthat they receive little benefit. The teaching they hear does not touch\nthe heart. Shall we make no personal appeal to them?\nAmong the victims of want and sin are found those who were\nonce in possession of wealth. Men of different vocations and dif-\nferent stations in life have been overcome by the pollutions of the\nworld, by the use of strong drink, by the indulgence of lust, and have\nfallen under temptation. While these fallen ones demand pity and\nhelp, should not some attention be given to those who have not yet\ndescended to these depths, but who are setting their feet in the same\npath?\nThousands in positions of trust and honor are indulging habits[211]\nthat mean ruin to soul and body. Ministers of the gospel, statesmen,\nauthors, men of wealth and talent, men of vast business capacity and\npower for usefulness, are in deadly peril because they do not see\nthe necessity of self-control in all things. They need to have their\nattention called to the principles of temperance, not in a narrow or\narbitrary way, but in the light of God\u2019s great purpose for humanity.\nCould the principles of true temperance thus be brought before them,\nthere are very many of the higher classes who would recognize their\nvalue and give them a hearty acceptance.\nWe should show these persons the result of harmful indulgences\nin lessening physical, mental, and moral power. Help them to realize\ntheir responsibility as stewards of God\u2019s gifts. Show them the good\nthey could do with the money they now spend for that which does\nthem only harm. Present the total abstinence pledge, asking that\nthe money they would otherwise spend for liquor, tobacco, or like\nindulgences be devoted to the relief of the sick poor or for the training\nof children and youth for usefulness in the world. To such an appeal\nnot many would refuse to listen.\nMinistry to the Rich 141\nThere is another danger to which the wealthy are especially ex-\nposed, and here is also a field for the medical missionary. Multitudes\nwho are prosperous in the world, and who never stoop to the com- [212]\nmon forms of vice, are yet brought to destruction through the love\nof riches. The cup most difficult to carry is not the cup that is empty,\nbut the cup that is full to the brim. It is this that needs to be most\ncarefully balanced. Affliction and adversity bring disappointment\nand sorrow; but it is prosperity that is most dangerous to spiritual\nlife.\nThose who are suffering reverses are represented by the bush that\nMoses saw in the desert, which, though burning, was not consumed.\nThe angel of the Lord was in the midst of the bush. So in deprivation\nand affliction the brightness of the presence of the Unseen is with us\nto comfort and sustain. Often prayer is solicited for those who are\nsuffering from illness or adversity; but our prayers are most needed\nby the men entrusted with prosperity and influence.\nIn the valley of humiliation, where men feel their need and\ndepend on God to guide their steps, there is comparative safety. But\nthe men who stand, as it were, on a lofty pinnacle, and who, because\nof their position, are supposed to possess great wisdom\u2014these are\nin greatest peril. Unless such men make God their dependence, they\nwill surely fall.\nThe Bible condemns no man for being rich, if he has acquired\nhis riches honestly. Not money, but the love of money, is the root\nof all evil. It is God who gives men power to get wealth; and in the\nhands of him who acts as God\u2019s steward, using his means unselfishly,\nwealth is a blessing, both to its possessor and to the world. But many,\nabsorbed in their interest in worldly treasures, become insensible to\nthe claims of God and the needs of their fellow men. They regard\ntheir wealth as a means of glorifying themselves. They add house to\nhouse, and land to land; they fill their homes with luxuries, while all\nabout them are human beings in misery and crime, in disease and\ndeath. Those who thus give their lives to self-serving are developing [213]\nin themselves, not the attributes of God, but the attributes of the\nwicked one.\nThese men are in need of the gospel. They need to have their eyes\nturned from the vanity of material things to behold the preciousness\n142 The Ministry of Healing\nof the enduring riches. They need to learn the joy of giving, the\nblessedness of being co-workers with God.\nThe Lord bids us, \u201cCharge them that are rich in this world\u201d that\nthey trust not \u201cin uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth\nus richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in\ngood works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up\nin store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,\nthat they may lay hold on eternal life.\u201d 1 Timothy 6:17-19.\nIt is by no casual, accidental touch that wealthy, world-loving,\nworld-worshiping souls can be drawn to Christ. These persons are\noften the most difficult of access. Personal effort must be put forth\nfor them by men and women imbued with the missionary spirit,\nthose who will not fail or be discouraged.\nSome are especially fitted to work for the higher classes. These\nshould seek wisdom from God to know how to reach these persons,\nto have not merely a casual acquaintance with them, but by personal\neffort and living faith to awaken them to the needs of the soul, to\nlead them to a knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus.\nMany suppose that in order to reach the higher classes, a manner\nof life and method of work must be adopted that will be suited to\ntheir fastidious tastes. An appearance of wealth, costly edifices,\nexpensive dress, equipage, and surroundings, conformity to worldly\ncustoms, the artificial polish of fashionable society, classical culture,\nthe graces of oratory, are thought to be essential. This is an error.[214]\nThe way of worldly policy is not God\u2019s way of reaching the higher\nclasses. That which will reach them effectually is a consistent,\nunselfish presentation of the gospel of Christ.\nThe experience of the apostle Paul in meeting the philosophers\nof Athens has a lesson for us. In presenting the gospel before the\ncourt of the Areopagus, Paul met logic with logic, science with\nscience, philosophy with philosophy. The wisest of his hearers\nwere astonished and silenced. His words could not be controverted.\nBut the effort bore little fruit. Few were led to accept the gospel.\nHenceforth Paul adopted a different manner of labor. He avoided\nelaborate arguments and discussion of theories, and in simplicity\npointed men and women to Christ as the Saviour of sinners. Writing\nto the Corinthians of his work among them, he said:\nMinistry to the Rich 143\n\u201cI, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of\nspeech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For [215]\nI determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ,\nand Him crucified.... My speech and my preaching was not with\nenticing words of man\u2019s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit\nand of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men,\nbut in the power of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 2:1-5.\nAgain, in his letter to the Romans, he says:\n\u201cI am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of\nGod unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and\nalso to the Greek.\u201d Romans 1:16.\nLet those who work for the higher classes bear themselves with\ntrue dignity, remembering that angels are their companions. Let\nthem keep the treasure house of mind and heart filled with, \u201cIt is\nwritten.\u201d Hang in memory\u2019s hall the precious words of Christ. They\nare to be valued far above gold or silver.\nChrist has said that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye\nof a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. In the\nwork for this class many discouragements will be presented, many\nheartsickening revelations will be made. But all things are possible\nwith God. He can and will work through human agencies upon the [216]\nminds of men whose lives have been devoted to money getting.\nThere are miracles to be wrought in genuine conversion, mira-\ncles that are not now discerned. The greatest men of the earth are\nnot beyond the power of a wonder-working God. If those who are\nworkers together with Him will do their duty bravely and faithfully,\nGod will convert men who occupy responsible places, men of intel-\nlect and influence. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, many will\nbe led to accept the divine principles.\nWhen it is made plain that the Lord expects them as His rep-\nresentatives to relieve suffering humanity, many will respond and\nwill give of their means and their sympathies for the benefit of the\npoor. As their minds are thus drawn away from their own selfish\ninterests, many will surrender themselves to Christ. With their tal-\nents of influence and means they will gladly unite in the work of\nbeneficence with the humble missionary who was God\u2019s agent in\ntheir conversion. By a right use of their earthly treasures they will\n144 The Ministry of Healing\nlay up for themselves \u201ca treasure in the heavens that faileth not,\nwhere no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.\u201d\nWhen converted to Christ, many will become agencies in the\nhand of God to work for others of their own class. They will feel\nthat a dispensation of the gospel is committed to them for those who\nhave made this world their all. Time and money will be consecrated\nto God, talent and influence will be devoted to the work of winning\nsouls to Christ.\nOnly eternity will reveal what has been accomplished by this\nkind of ministry\u2014how many souls, sick with doubt and tired of\nworldliness and unrest, have been brought to the great Restorer, who\nlongs to save to the uttermost all that come unto Him. Christ is a\nrisen Saviour, and there is healing in His wings.\nThe Care of the Sick [217]\n[218]\n\u201cThey shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. \u201d\nChapter 15\u2014In the Sickroom[219]\nThose who minister to the sick should understand the importance\nof careful attention to the laws of health. Nowhere is obedience to\nthese laws more important than in the sickroom. Nowhere does\nso much depend upon faithfulness in little things on the part of\nthe attendants. In cases of serious illness, a little neglect, a slight\ninattention to a patient\u2019s special needs or dangers, the manifestation\nof fear, excitement, or petulance, even a lack of sympathy, may turn\nthe scale that is balancing life and death, and cause to go down to\nthe grave a patient who otherwise might have recovered.\nThe efficiency of the nurse depends, to a great degree, upon phys-\nical vigor. The better the health, the better will she be able to endure\nthe strain of attendance upon the sick, and the more successfully\ncan she perform her duties. Those who care for the sick should give\nspecial attention to diet, cleanliness, fresh air, and exercise. Like\ncarefulness on the part of the family will enable them also to endure\nthe extra burdens brought upon them, and will help to prevent them\nfrom contracting disease.\nWhere the illness is serious, requiring the attendance of a nurse[220]\nnight and day, the work should be shared by at least two efficient\nnurses, so that each may have opportunity for rest and for exercise\nin the open air. This is especially important in cases where it is\ndifficult to secure an abundance of fresh air in the sickroom. Through\nignorance of the importance of fresh air, ventilation is sometimes\nrestricted, and the lives of both patient and attendant are often in\ndanger.\nIf proper precaution is observed, noncontagious diseases need\nnot be taken by others. Let the habits be correct, and by cleanliness\nand proper ventilation keep the sickroom free from poisonous el-\nements. Under such conditions, the sick are much more likely to\nrecover, and in most cases neither attendants nor the members of the\nfamily will contract the disease.\n146\nIn the Sickroom 147\nSunlight, Ventilation, and Temperature\nTo afford the patient the most favorable conditions for recovery,\nthe room he occupies should be large, light, and cheerful, with\nopportunity for thorough ventilation. The room in the house that\nbest meets these requirements should be chosen as the sickroom.\nMany houses have no special provision for proper ventilation, and\nto secure it is difficult; but every possible effort should be made to\narrange the sickroom so that a current of fresh air can pass through\nit night and day.\nSo far as possible an even temperature should be maintained in [221]\nthe sickroom. The thermometer should be consulted. Those who\nhave the care of the sick, being often deprived of sleep or awakened\nin the night to attend to the patient, are liable to chilliness and are\nnot good judges of a healthful temperature.\nDiet\nAn important part of the nurse\u2019s duty is the care of the patient\u2019s\ndiet. The patient should not be allowed to suffer or become unduly\nweakened through lack of nourishment, nor should the enfeebled\ndigestive powers be overtaxed. Care should be taken so to prepare\nand serve the food that it will be palatable, but wise judgment should\nbe used in adapting it to the needs of the patient, both in quantity\nand quality. In times of convalescence especially, when the appetite\nis keen, before the digestive organs have recovered strength, there is\ngreat danger of injury from errors in diet.\nDuties of Attendants\nNurses, and all who have to do with the sickroom, should be\ncheerful, calm, and self-possessed. All hurry, excitement, or confu-\nsion, should be avoided. Doors should be opened and shut with care,\nand the whole household be kept quiet. In cases of fever, special care\nis needed when the crisis comes and the fever is passing away. Then [222]\nconstant watching is often necessary. Ignorance, forgetfulness, and\nrecklessness have caused the death of many who might have lived\nhad they received proper care from judicious, thoughtful nurses.\n148 The Ministry of Healing\nVisiting the Sick\nIt is misdirected kindness, a false idea of courtesy, that leads to\nmuch visiting of the sick. Those who are very ill should not have\nvisitors. The excitement connected with receiving callers wearies the\npatient at a time when he is in the greatest need of quiet, undisturbed\nrest.\nTo a convalescent or a patient suffering from chronic disease, it is\noften a pleasure and a benefit to know that he is kindly remembered;\nbut this assurance conveyed by a message of sympathy or by some\nlittle gift will often serve a better purpose than a personal visit, and\nwithout danger of harm.\nInstitutional Nursing\nIn sanitariums and hospitals, where nurses are constantly as-\nsociated with large numbers of sick people, it requires a decided\neffort to be always pleasant and cheerful, and to show thoughtful\nconsideration in every word and act. In these institutions it is of the\nutmost importance that the nurses strive to do their work wisely and\nwell. They need ever to remember that in the discharge of their daily[223]\nduties they are serving the Lord Christ.\nThe sick need to have wise words spoken to them. Nurses\nshould study the Bible daily, that they may be able to speak words\nthat will enlighten and help the suffering. Angels of God are in\nthe rooms where these suffering ones are being ministered to, and\nthe atmosphere surrounding the soul of the one giving treatment\nshould be pure and fragrant. Physicians and nurses are to cherish the\nprinciples of Christ. In their lives His virtues are to be seen. Then,\nby what they do and say, they will draw the sick to the Saviour.\nThe Christian nurse, while administering treatment for the\nrestoration of health, will pleasantly and successfully draw the mind\nof the patient to Christ, the healer of the soul as well as of the body.\nThe thoughts presented, here a little and there a little, will have their\ninfluence. The older nurses should lose no favorable opportunity of[224]\ncalling the attention of the sick to Christ. They should be ever ready\nto blend spiritual healing with physical healing.\nIn the Sickroom 149\nIn the kindest and tenderest manner nurses are to teach that he\nwho would be healed must cease to transgress the law of God. He\nmust cease to choose a life of sin. God cannot bless the one who\ncontinues to bring upon himself disease and suffering by a willful\nviolation of the laws of heaven. But Christ, through the Holy Spirit,\ncomes as a healing power to those who cease to do evil and learn to\ndo well.\nThose who have no love for God will work constantly against\nthe best interests of soul and body. But those who awake to the\nimportance of living in obedience to God in this present evil world\nwill be willing to separate from every wrong habit. Gratitude and\nlove will fill their hearts. They know that Christ is their friend. In\nmany cases the realization that they have such a friend means more\nto the suffering ones in their recovery from sickness than the best\ntreatment that can be given. But both lines of ministry are essential.\nThey are to go hand in hand.\nChapter 16\u2014Prayer for the Sick[225]\nThe Scripture says that \u201cmen ought always to pray, and not\nto faint\u201d (Luke 18:1); and if ever there is a time when they feel\ntheir need of prayer, it is when strength fails and life itself seems\nslipping from their grasp. Often those who are in health forget the\nwonderful mercies continued to them day by day, year after year, and\nthey render no tribute of praise to God for His benefits. But when\nsickness comes, God is remembered. When human strength fails,\nmen feel their need of divine help. And never does our merciful God\nturn from the soul that in sincerity seeks Him for help. He is our\nrefuge in sickness as in health.\n\u201cLike as a father pitieth his children,\nSo the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\nFor He knoweth our frame;\nHe remembereth that we are dust.\u201d\nPsalm 103:13, 14.\n\u201cBecause of their transgression,\nAnd because of their iniquities, [men] are afflicted.\nTheir soul abhorreth all manner of food;\nAnd they draw near unto the gates of death.\u201d\nPsalm 107:17, 18, A.R.V .\n\u201cThen they cry unto the Lord in their trouble,\nAnd He saveth them out of their distresses.\nHe sendeth His word, and healeth them,\nAnd delivereth them from their destructions.\u201d\nVerses 19, 20, R.V .\nGod is just as willing to restore the sick to health now as when[226]\nthe Holy Spirit spoke these words through the psalmist. And Christ\nis the same compassionate physician now that He was during His\n150\nPrayer for the Sick 151\nearthly ministry. In Him there is healing balm for every disease,\nrestoring power for every infirmity. His disciples in this time are\nto pray for the sick as verily as the disciples of old prayed. And\nrecoveries will follow; for \u201cthe prayer of faith shall save the sick.\u201d\nWe have the Holy Spirit\u2019s power, the calm assurance of faith, that\ncan claim God\u2019s promises. The Lord\u2019s promise, \u201cThey shall lay\nhands on the sick, and they shall recover\u201d (Mark 16:18), is just\nas trustworthy now as in the days of the apostles. It presents the\nprivilege of God\u2019s children, and our faith should lay hold of all that\nit embraces. Christ\u2019s servants are the channel of His working, and\nthrough them He desires to exercise His healing power. It is our\nwork to present the sick and suffering to God in the arms of our faith.\nWe should teach them to believe in the Great Healer.\nThe Saviour would have us encourage the sick, the hopeless,\nthe afflicted, to take hold upon His strength. Through faith and\nprayer the sickroom may be transformed into a Bethel. In word and\ndeed, physicians and nurses may say, so plainly that it cannot be\nmisunderstood, \u201cGod is in this place\u201d to save, and not to destroy.\nChrist desires to manifest His presence in the sickroom, filling the\nhearts of physicians and nurses with the sweetness of His love. If\nthe life of the attendants upon the sick is such that Christ can go\nwith them to the bedside of the patient, there will come to him\nthe conviction that the compassionate Saviour is present, and this\nconviction will itself do much for the healing of both the soul and\nthe body.\nAnd God hears prayer. Christ has said, \u201cIf ye shall ask anything\nin My name, I will do it.\u201d Again He says, \u201cIf any man serve Me,\nhim will My Father honor.\u201d John 14:14; 12:26. If we live according\nto His word, every precious promise He has given will be fulfilled [227]\nto us. We are undeserving of His mercy, but as we give ourselves\nto Him, He receives us. He will work for and through those who\nfollow Him.\nBut only as we live in obedience to His word can we claim the\nfulfillment of His promises. The psalmist says, \u201cIf I regard iniquity\nin my heart, the Lord will not hear me.\u201d Psalm 66:18. If we render\nto Him only a partial, halfhearted obedience, His promises will not\nbe fulfilled to us.\n152 The Ministry of Healing\nIn the word of God we have instruction relative to special prayer\nfor the recovery of the sick. But the offering of such prayer is a\nmost solemn act, and should not be entered upon without careful\nconsideration. In many cases of prayer for the healing of the sick,\nthat which is called faith is nothing less than presumption.\nMany persons bring disease upon themselves by their self-indul-\ngence. They have not lived in accordance with natural law or the\nprinciples of strict purity. Others have disregarded the laws of health\nin their habits of eating and drinking, dressing, or working. Often\nsome form of vice is the cause of feebleness of mind or body. Should\nthese persons gain the blessing of health, many of them would con-\ntinue to pursue the same course of heedless transgression of God\u2019s\nnatural and spiritual laws, reasoning that if God heals them in answer\nto prayer, they are at liberty to continue their unhealthful practices\nand to indulge perverted appetite without restraint. If God were to\nwork a miracle in restoring these persons to health, He would be\nencouraging sin.\nIt is labor lost to teach people to look to God as a healer of\ntheir infirmities, unless they are taught also to lay aside unhealthful\npractices. In order to receive His blessing in answer to prayer, they\nmust cease to do evil and learn to do well. Their surroundings must\nbe sanitary, their habits of life correct. They must live in harmony[228]\nwith the law of God, both natural and spiritual.\nConfession of Sin\nTo those who desire prayer for their restoration to health, it\nshould be made plain that the violation of God\u2019s law, either natural\nor spiritual, is sin, and that in order for them to receive His blessing,\nsin must be confessed and forsaken.\nThe Scripture bids us, \u201cConfess your faults one to another, and\npray one for another, that ye may be healed.\u201d James 5:16. To the one\nasking for prayer, let thoughts like these be presented: \u201cWe cannot\nread the heart, or know the secrets of your life. These are known\nonly to yourself and to God. If you repent of your sins, it is your\nduty to make confession of them.\u201d Sin of a private character is to be\nconfessed to Christ, the only mediator between God and man. For\n\u201cif any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ\nPrayer for the Sick 153\nthe righteous.\u201d 1 John 2:1. Every sin is an offense against God and [229]\nis to be confessed to Him through Christ. Every open sin should be\nas openly confessed. Wrong done to a fellow being should be made\nright with the one who has been offended. If any who are seeking\nhealth have been guilty of evilspeaking, if they have sowed discord\nin the home, the neighborhood, or the church, and have stirred up\nalienation and dissension, if by any wrong practice they have led\nothers into sin, these things should be confessed before God and\nbefore those who have been offended. \u201cIf we confess our sins, He\nis faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all\nunrighteousness.\u201d 1 John 1:9.\nWhen wrongs have been righted, we may present the needs of\nthe sick to the Lord in calm faith, as His Spirit may indicate. He\nknows each individual by name, and cares for each as if there were\nnot another upon the earth for whom He gave His beloved Son.\nBecause God\u2019s love is so great and so unfailing, the sick should be\nencouraged to trust in Him and be cheerful. To be anxious about\nthemselves tends to cause weakness and disease. If they will rise\nabove depression and gloom, their prospect of recovery will be\nbetter; for \u201cthe eye of the Lord is upon them\u201d \u201cthat hope in His\nmercy.\u201d Psalm 33:18.\nIn prayer for the sick it should be remembered that \u201cwe know\nnot what we should pray for as we ought.\u201d Romans 8:26. We do not\nknow whether the blessing we desire will be best or not. Therefore\nour prayers should include this thought: \u201cLord, thou knowest every\nsecret of the soul. Thou art acquainted with these persons. Jesus,\ntheir Advocate, gave His life for them. His love for them is greater\nthan ours can possibly be. If, therefore, it is for Thy glory and\nthe good of the afflicted ones, we ask, in the name of Jesus, that\nthey may be restored to health. If it be not Thy will that they may\nbe restored, we ask that Thy grace may comfort and Thy presence [230]\nsustain them in their sufferings.\u201d\nGod knows the end from the beginning. He is acquainted with\nthe hearts of all men. He reads every secret of the soul. He knows\nwhether those for whom prayer is offered would or would not be\nable to endure the trials that would come upon them should they\nlive. He knows whether their lives would be a blessing or a curse to\nthemselves and to the world. This is one reason why, while present-\n154 The Ministry of Healing\ning our petitions with earnestness, we should say, \u201cNevertheless not\nmy will, but Thine, be done.\u201d Luke 22:42. Jesus added these words\nof submission to the wisdom and will of God when in the Garden\nof Gethsemane He pleaded, \u201cO My Father, if it be possible, let this\ncup pass from Me.\u201d Matthew 26:39. And if they were appropriate\nfor Him, the Son of God, how much more are they becoming on the\nlips of finite, erring mortals!\nThe consistent course is to commit our desires to our all-wise\nheavenly Father, and then, in perfect confidence, trust all to Him.\nWe know that God hears us if we ask according to His will. But\nto press our petitions without a submissive spirit is not right; our\nprayers must take the form, not of command, but of intercession.\nThere are cases where God works decidedly by His divine power\nin the restoration of health. But not all the sick are healed. Many are\nlaid away to sleep in Jesus. John on the Isle of Patmos was bidden to\nwrite: \u201cBlessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth:\nYea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their\nworks do follow them.\u201d Revelation 14:13. From this we see that if\npersons are not raised to health, they should not on this account be\njudged as wanting in faith.\nWe all desire immediate and direct answers to our prayers, and[231]\nare tempted to become discouraged when the answer is delayed or\ncomes in an unlooked-for form. But God is too wise and good to\nanswer our prayers always at just the time and in just the manner we\ndesire. He will do more and better for us than to accomplish all our\nwishes. And because we can trust His wisdom and love, we should\nnot ask Him to concede to our will, but should seek to enter into and\naccomplish His purpose. Our desires and interests should be lost in\nHis will. These experiences that test faith are for our benefit. By\nthem it is made manifest whether our faith is true and sincere, resting\non the word of God alone, or whether depending on circumstances,\nit is uncertain and changeable. Faith is strengthened by exercise.\nWe must let patience have its perfect work, remembering that there\nare precious promises in the Scriptures for those who wait upon the\nLord.\nNot all understand these principles. Many who seek the Lord\u2019s\nhealing mercy think that they must have a direct and immediate\nanswer to their prayers or their faith is defective. For this reason,\nPrayer for the Sick 155\nthose who are weakened by disease need to be counseled wisely, that\nthey may act with discretion. They should not disregard their duty\nto the friends who may survive them, or neglect to employ nature\u2019s\nagencies for the restoration of health.\nOften there is danger of error here. Believing that they will be\nhealed in answer to prayer, some fear to do anything that might\nseem to indicate a lack of faith. But they should not neglect to set\ntheir affairs in order as they would desire to do if they expected\nto be removed by death. Nor should they fear to utter words of\nencouragement or counsel which at the parting hour they wish to\nspeak to their loved ones.\nThose who seek healing by prayer should not neglect to make\nuse of the remedial agencies within their reach. It is not a denial [232]\nof faith to use such remedies as God has provided to alleviate pain\nand to aid nature in her work of restoration. It is no denial of faith\nto co-operate with God, and to place themselves in the condition\nmost favorable to recovery. God has put it in our power to obtain\na knowledge of the laws of life. This knowledge has been placed\nwithin our reach for use. We should employ every facility for the\nrestoration of health, taking every advantage possible, working in\nharmony with natural laws. When we have prayed for the recovery\nof the sick, we can work with all the more energy, thanking God\nthat we have the privilege of co-operating with Him, and asking His\nblessing on the means which He Himself has provided.\nWe have the sanction of the word of God for the use of remedial\nagencies. Hezekiah, king of Israel, was sick, and a prophet of God\nbrought him the message that he should die. He cried unto the Lord,\nand the Lord heard His servant and sent him a message that fifteen\nyears should be added to his life. Now, one word from God would\nhave healed Hezekiah instantly; but special directions were given,\n\u201cLet them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil,\nand he shall recover.\u201d Isaiah 38:21.\nOn one occasion Christ anointed the eyes of a blind man with [233]\nclay and bade him, \u201cGo, wash in the pool of Siloam.... He went his\nway therefore, and washed, and came seeing.\u201d John 9:7. The cure\ncould be wrought only by the power of the Great Healer, yet Christ\nmade use of the simple agencies of nature. While He did not give\n156 The Ministry of Healing\ncountenance to drug medication, He sanctioned the use of simple\nand natural remedies.\nWhen we have prayed for the recovery of the sick, whatever the\noutcome of the case, let us not lose faith in God. If we are called\nupon to meet bereavement, let us accept the bitter cup, remembering\nthat a Father\u2019s hand holds it to our lips. But should health be restored,\nit should not be forgotten that the recipient of healing mercy is placed\nunder renewed obligation to the Creator. When the ten lepers were\ncleansed, only one returned to find Jesus and give Him glory. Let\nnone of us be like the unthinking nine, whose hearts were untouched\nby the mercy of God. \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from\nabove, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no\nvariableness, neither shadow of turning.\u201d James 1:17.\nChapter 17\u2014The Use of Remedies [234]\nDisease never comes without a cause. The way is prepared, and\ndisease invited, by disregard of the laws of health. Many suffer in\nconsequence of the transgression of their parents. While they are\nnot responsible for what their parents have done, it is nevertheless\ntheir duty to ascertain what are and what are not violations of the\nlaws of health. They should avoid the wrong habits of their parents\nand, by correct living, place themselves in better conditions.\nThe greater number, however, suffer because of their own wrong\ncourse of action. They disregard the principles of health by their\nhabits of eating, drinking, dressing, and working. Their transgression\nof nature\u2019s laws produces the sure result; and when sickness comes\nupon them, many do not credit their suffering to the true cause, but\nmurmur against God because of their afflictions. But God is not\nresponsible for the suffering that follows disregard of natural law.\nGod has endowed us with a certain amount of vital force. He has\nalso formed us with organs suited to maintain the various functions\nof life, and He designs that these organs shall work together in [235]\nharmony. If we carefully preserve the life force, and keep the delicate\nmechanism of the body in order, the result is health; but if the vital\nforce is too rapidly exhausted, the nervous system borrows power\nfor present use from its resources of strength, and when one organ is\ninjured, all are affected. Nature bears much abuse without apparent\nresistance; she then arouses and makes a determined effort to remove\nthe effects of the ill-treatment she has suffered. Her effort to correct\nthese conditions is often manifest in fever and various other forms\nof sickness.\nRational Remedies\nWhen the abuse of health is carried so far that sickness results,\nthe sufferer can often do for himself what no one else can do for\nhim. The first thing to be done is to ascertain the true character of\n157\n158 The Ministry of Healing\nthe sickness and then go to work intelligently to remove the cause.\nIf the harmonious working of the system has become unbalanced\nby overwork, overeating, or other irregularities, do not endeavor to\nadjust the difficulties by adding a burden of poisonous medicines.\nIntemperate eating is often the cause of sickness, and what nature\nmost needs is to be relieved of the undue burden that has been placed\nupon her. In many cases of sickness, the very best remedy is for\nthe patient to fast for a meal or two, that the overworked organs\nof digestion may have an opportunity to rest. A fruit diet for a\nfew days has often brought great relief to brain workers. Many\ntimes a short period of entire abstinence from food, followed by\nsimple, moderate eating, has led to recovery through nature\u2019s own\nrecuperative effort. An abstemious diet for a month or two would\nconvince many sufferers that the path of self-denial is the path to\nhealth.\nRest as a Remedy[236]\nSome make themselves sick by overwork. For these, rest, free-\ndom from care, and a spare diet, are essential to restoration of health.\nTo those who are brain weary and nervous because of continual[237]\nlabor and close confinement, a visit to the country, where they can\nlive a simple, carefree life, coming in close contact with the things\nof nature, will be most helpful. Roaming through the fields and the\nwoods, picking the flowers, listening to the songs of the birds, will\ndo far more that any other agency toward their recovery.\nIn health and in sickness, pure water is one of heaven\u2019s choicest\nblessings. Its proper use promotes health. It is the beverage which\nGod provided to quench the thirst of animals and man. Drunk freely,\nit helps to supply the necessities of the system and assists nature to\nresist disease. The external application of water is one of the easiest\nand most satisfactory ways of regulating the circulation of the blood.\nA cold or cool bath is an excellent tonic. Warm baths open the pores\nand thus aid in the elimination of impurities. Both warm and neutral\nbaths soothe the nerves and equalize the circulation.\nBut many have never learned by experience the beneficial effects\nof the proper use of water, and they are afraid of it. Water treatments\nare not appreciated as they should be, and to apply them skillfully\nUse of Remedies 159\nrequires work that many are unwilling to perform. But none should\nfeel excused for ignorance or indifference on this subject. There are\nmany ways in which water can be applied to relieve pain and check\ndisease. All should become intelligent in its use in simple home\ntreatments. Mothers, especially, should know how to care for their\nfamilies in both health and sickness.\nAction is a law of our being. Every organ of the body has its\nappointed work, upon the performance of which its development and\nstrength depend. The normal action of all the organs gives strength\nand vigor, while the tendency of disuse is toward decay and death.\nBind up an arm, even for a few weeks, then free it from its bands,\nand you will see that it is weaker than the one you have been using [238]\nmoderately during the same time. Inactivity produces the same\neffect upon the whole muscular system.\nInactivity is a fruitful cause of disease. Exercise quickens and\nequalizes the circulation of the blood, but in idleness the blood\ndoes not circulate freely, and the changes in it, so necessary to life\nand health, do not take place. The skin, too, becomes inactive.\nImpurities are not expelled as they would be if the circulation had\nbeen quickened by vigorous exercise, the skin kept in a healthy\ncondition, and the lungs fed with plenty of pure, fresh air. This state\nof the system throws a double burden on the excretory organs, and\ndisease is the result.\nInvalids should not be encouraged in inactivity. When there has\nbeen serious overtaxation in any direction, entire rest for a time will\nsometimes ward off serious illness; but in the case of confirmed\ninvalids, it is seldom necessary to suspend all activity.\nThose who have broken down from mental labor should have\nrest from wearing thought; but they should not be led to believe that\nit is dangerous to use their mental powers at all. Many are inclined\nto regard their condition as worse than it really is. This state of mind\nis unfavorable to recovery, and should not be encouraged.\nMinisters, teachers, students, and other brain workers often suffer\nfrom illness as the result of severe mental taxation, unrelieved by\nphysical exercise. What these persons need is a more active life.\nStrictly temperate habits, combined with proper exercise, would\nensure both mental and physical vigor, and would give power of\nendurance to all brain workers.\n160 The Ministry of Healing\nThose who have overtaxed their physical powers should not be\nencouraged to forgo manual labor entirely. But labor, to be of the[239]\ngreatest advantage, should be systematic and agreeable. Outdoor\nexercise is the best; it should be so planned as to strengthen by use\nthe organs that have become weakened; and the heart should be in it;\nthe labor of the hands should never degenerate into mere drudgery.\nWhen invalids have nothing to occupy their time and attention,\ntheir thoughts become centered upon themselves, and they grow\nmorbid and irritable. Many times they dwell upon their bad feelings\nuntil they think themselves much worse than they really are and\nwholly unable to do anything.\nIn all these cases well-directed physical exercise would prove\nan effective remedial agent. In some cases it is indispensable to the\nrecovery of health. The will goes with the labor of the hands; and\nwhat these invalids need is to have the will aroused. When the will\nis dormant, the imagination becomes abnormal, and it is impossible\nto resist disease.\nInactivity is the greatest curse that could come upon most in-[240]\nvalids. Light employment in useful labor, while it does not tax\nmind or body, has a happy influence upon both. It strengthens the\nmuscles, improves the circulation, and gives the invalid the satis-\nfaction of knowing that he is not wholly useless in this busy world.\nHe may be able to do but little at first, but he will soon find his\nstrength increasing, and the amount of work done can be increased\naccordingly.\nExercise aids the dyspeptic by giving the digestive organs a\nhealthy tone. To engage in severe study or violent physical exercise\nimmediately after eating, hinders the work of digestion; but a short\nwalk after a meal, with the head erect and the shoulders back, is a\ngreat benefit.\nNotwithstanding all that is said and written concerning its im-\nportance, there are still many who neglect physical exercise. Some\ngrow corpulent because the system is clogged; others become thin\nand feeble because their vital powers are exhausted in disposing of\nan excess of food. The liver is burdened in its effort to cleanse the\nblood of impurities, and illness is the result.\nThose whose habits are sedentary should, when the weather\nwill permit, exercise in the open air every day, summer or winter.\nUse of Remedies 161\nWalking is preferable to riding or driving, for it brings more of the\nmuscles into exercise. The lungs are forced into healthy action, since\nit is impossible to walk briskly without inflating them.\nSuch exercise would in many cases be better for the health than\nmedicine. Physicians often advise their patients to take an ocean\nvoyage, to go to some mineral spring, or to visit different places for\nchange of climate, when in most cases if they would eat temperately,\nand take cheerful, healthful exercise, they would recover health and\nwould save time and money.\nChapter 18\u2014Mind Cure[241]\nThe relation that exists between the mind and the body is very\nintimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condition\nof the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many\nrealize. Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result\nof mental depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt,\ndistrust, all tend to break down the life forces and to invite decay\nand death.\nDisease is sometimes produced, and is often greatly aggravated,\nby the imagination. Many are lifelong invalids who might be well if\nthey only thought so. Many imagine that every slight exposure will\ncause illness, and the evil effect is produced because it is expected.\nMany die from disease the cause of which is wholly imaginary.\nCourage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and pro-\nlong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the body\nand strength to the soul. \u201cA merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like\na medicine.\u201d Proverbs 17:22.\nIn the treatment of the sick the effect of mental influence should\nnot be overlooked. Rightly used, this influence affords one of the\nmost effective agencies for combating disease.\nControl of Mind Over Mind[242]\nThere is, however, a form of mind cure that is one of the most\neffective agencies for evil. Through this so-called science, one mind\nis brought under the control of another so that the individuality of the\nweaker is merged in that of the stronger mind. One person acts out\nthe will of another. Thus it is claimed that the tenor of the thoughts\nmay be changed, that health-giving impulses may be imparted, and\npatients may be enabled to resist and overcome disease.\nThis method of cure has been employed by persons who were\nignorant of its real nature and tendency, and who believed it to be a\nmeans of benefit to the sick. But the so-called science is based upon\n162\nMind Cure 163\nfalse principles. It is foreign to the nature and spirit of Christ. It\ndoes not lead to Him who is life and salvation. The one who attracts\nminds to himself leads them to separate from the true Source of their\nstrength.\nIt is not God\u2019s purpose that any human being should yield his\nmind and will to the control of another, becoming a passive instru-\nment in his hands. No one is to merge his individuality in that of\nanother. He is not to look to any human being as the source of heal-\ning. His dependence must be in God. In the dignity of his God-given\nmanhood he is to be controlled by God Himself, not by any human\nintelligence.\nGod desires to bring men into direct relation with Himself. In\nall His dealings with human beings He recognizes the principle of\npersonal responsibility. He seeks to encourage a sense of personal\ndependence and to impress the need of personal guidance. He desires\nto bring the human into association with the divine, that men may\nbe transformed into the divine likeness. Satan works to thwart this\npurpose. He seeks to encourage dependence upon men. When minds\nare turned away from God, the tempter can bring them under his [243]\nrule. He can control humanity.\nThe theory of mind controlling mind was originated by Satan,\nto introduce himself as the chief worker, to put human philosophy\nwhere divine philosophy should be. Of all the errors that are finding\nacceptance among professedly Christian people, none is a more\ndangerous deception, none more certain to separate man from God,\nthan is this. Innocent though it may appear, if exercised upon patients\nit will tend to their destruction, not to their restoration. It opens a\ndoor through which Satan will enter to take possession both of the\nmind that is given up to be controlled by another, and of the mind\nthat controls.\nFearful is the power thus given to evil-minded men and women.\nWhat opportunities it affords to those who live by taking advantage\nof other\u2019s weaknesses or follies! How many, through control of\nminds feeble or diseased, will find a means of gratifying lustful\npassion or greed of gain!\nThere is something better for us to engage in than the control of\nhumanity by humanity. The physician should educate the people to\nlook from the human to the divine. Instead of teaching the sick to\n164 The Ministry of Healing\ndepend upon human beings for the cure of soul and body, he should\ndirect them to the One who can save to the uttermost all who come\nunto Him. He who made man\u2019s mind knows what the mind needs.\nGod alone is the One who can heal. Those whose minds and bodies\nare diseased are to behold in Christ the restorer. \u201cBecause I live,[244]\nHe says, \u201cye shall live also.\u201d John 14:19. This is the life we are\nto present to the sick, telling them that if they have faith in Christ\nas the restorer, if they co-operate with Him, obeying the laws of\nhealth, and striving to perfect holiness in His fear, He will impart\nto them His life. When we present Christ to them in this way, we\nare imparting a power, a strength, that is of value; for it comes from\nabove. This is the true science of healing for body and soul.\nSympathy\nGreat wisdom is needed in dealing with diseases caused through\nthe mind. A sore, sick heart, a discouraged mind, needs mild treat-\nment. Many times some living home trouble is, like a canker, eating\nto the very soul and weakening the life force. And sometimes it\nis the case that remorse for sin undermines the constitution and\nunbalances the mind. It is through tender sympathy that this class\nof invalids can be benefited. The physician should first gain their\nconfidence and then point them to the Great Healer. If their faith can\nbe directed to the True Physician, and they can have confidence that\nHe has undertaken their case, this will bring relief to the mind and\noften give health to the body.\nSympathy and tact will often prove a greater benefit to the sick\nthan will the most skillful treatment given in a cold, indifferent way.\nWhen a physician comes to the sickbed with a listless, careless\nmanner, looks at the afflicted one with little concern, by word or\naction giving the impression that the case is not one requiring much\nattention, and then leaves the patient to his own reflections, he has\ndone that patient positive harm. The doubt and discouragement\nproduced by his indifference will often counteract the good effect of\nthe remedies he may prescribe.\nIf physicians could put themselves in the place of the one whose[245]\nspirit is humbled and whose will is weakened by suffering, and who\nlongs for words of sympathy and assurance, they would be better\nMind Cure 165\nprepared to appreciate his feelings. When the love and sympathy\nthat Christ manifested for the sick is combined with the physician\u2019s\nknowledge, his very presence will be a blessing.\nFrankness in dealing with a patient inspires him with confidence,\nand thus proves an important aid to recovery. There are physicians\nwho consider it wise policy to conceal from the patient the nature\nand cause of the disease from which he is suffering. Many, fearing to\nexcite or discourage a patient by stating the truth, will hold out false\nhopes of recovery, and even allow a patient to go down to the grave\nwithout warning him of his danger. All this is unwise. It may not\nalways be safe or best to explain to the patient the full extent of his\ndanger. This might alarm him and retard or even prevent recovery.\nNor can the whole truth always be told to those whose ailments are\nlargely imaginary. Many of these persons are unreasonable, and\nhave not accustomed themselves to exercise self-control. They have\npeculiar fancies, and imagine many things that are false in regard\nto themselves and to others. To them these things are real, and\nthose who care for them need to manifest constant kindness and\nunwearied patience and tact. If these patients were told the truth in\nregard to themselves, some would be offended, others discouraged.\nChrist said to His disciples, \u201cI have yet many things to say unto\nyou, but ye cannot bear them now.\u201d John 16:12. But though the\ntruth may not all be spoken on all occasions, it is never necessary\nor justifiable to deceive. Never should the physician or the nurse\nstoop to prevarication. He who does this places himself where God\ncannot co-operate with him, and in forfeiting the confidence of his\npatients he is casting away one of the most effective human aids to\ntheir restoration.\nThe power of the will is not valued as it should be. Let the will [246]\nbe kept awake and rightly directed, and it will impart energy to the\nwhole being and will be a wonderful aid in the maintenance of health.\nIt is a power also in dealing with disease. Exercised in the right\ndirection, it would control the imagination and be a potent means\nof resisting and overcoming disease of both mind and body. By the\nexercise of the will power in placing themselves in right relation to\nlife, patients can do much to co-operate with the physician\u2019s efforts\nfor their recovery. There are thousands who can recover health if\nthey will. The Lord does not want them to be sick. He desires\n166 The Ministry of Healing\nthem to be well and happy, and they should make up their minds\nto be well. Often invalids can resist disease simply by refusing to\nyield to ailments and settle down in a state of inactivity. Rising\nabove their aches and pains, let them engage in useful employment\nsuited to their strength. By such employment and the free use of air\nand sunlight, many an emaciated invalid might recover health and\nstrength.\nBible Principles of Cure\nFor those who would regain or preserve health there is a lesson\nin the words of Scripture, \u201cBe not drunk with wine, wherein is\nexcess; but be filled with the Spirit.\u201d Ephesians 5:18. Not through\nthe excitement or oblivion produced by unnatural or unhealthful\nstimulants; not through indulgence of the lower appetites or passions,\nis to be found true healing or refreshment for the body or the soul.\nAmong the sick are many who are without God and without hope.\nThey suffer from ungratified desires, disordered passions, and the\ncondemnation of their own consciences; they are losing their hold\nupon this life, and they have no prospect for the life to come. Let\nnot the attendants upon the sick hope to benefit these patients by[247]\ngranting them frivolous, exciting indulgences. These have been\nthe curse of their lives. The hungry, thirsting soul will continue to\nhunger and thirst so long as it seeks to find satisfaction here. Those\nwho drink at the fountain of selfish pleasure are deceived. They\nmistake hilarity for strength, and when the excitement ceases, their\ninspiration ends, and they are left to discontent and despondency.\nAbiding peace, true rest of spirit, has but one Source. It was of\nthis that Christ spoke when He said, \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\n\u201cPeace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you: not as the world\ngiveth, give I unto you.\u201d John 14:27. This peace is not something\nthat He gives apart from Himself. It is in Christ, and we can receive\nit only by receiving Him.\nChrist is the wellspring of life. That which many need is to have\na clearer knowledge of Him; they need to be patiently and kindly,\nyet earnestly, taught how the whole being may be thrown open to\nthe healing agencies of heaven. When the sunlight of God\u2019s love\nMind Cure 167\nilluminates the darkened chambers of the soul, restless weariness\nand dissatisfaction will cease, and satisfying joys will give vigor to\nthe mind and health and energy to the body.\nWe are in a world of suffering. Difficulty, trial, and sorrow await\nus all along the way to the heavenly home. But there are many\nwho make life\u2019s burdens doubly heavy by continually anticipating\ntrouble. If they meet with adversity or disappointment they think [248]\nthat everything is going to ruin, that theirs is the hardest lot of all,\nthat they are surely coming to want. Thus they bring wretchedness\nupon themselves and cast a shadow upon all around them. Life\nitself becomes a burden to them. But it need not be thus. It will\ncost a determined effort to change the current of their thought. But\nthe change can be made. Their happiness, both for this life and\nfor the life to come, depends upon their fixing their minds upon\ncheerful things. Let them look away from the dark picture, which is\nimaginary, to the benefits which God has strewn in their pathway,\nand beyond these to the unseen and eternal.\nFor every trial, God has provided help. When Israel in the desert\ncame to the bitter waters of Marah, Moses cried unto the Lord. The\nLord did not provide some new remedy; He called attention to that\nwhich was at hand. A shrub which He had created was to be cast\ninto the fountain to make the water pure and sweet. When this was\ndone, the people drank of the water and were refreshed. In every\ntrial, if we seek Him, Christ will give us help. Our eyes will be\nopened to discern the healing promises recorded in His word. The\nHoly Spirit will teach us how to appropriate every blessing that will\nbe an antidote to grief. For every bitter draft that is placed to our\nlips, we shall find a branch of healing.\nWe are not to let the future, with its hard problems, its unsat-\nisfying prospects, make our hearts faint, our knees tremble, our\nhands hang down. \u201cLet him take hold of My strength,\u201d says the\nMighty One, \u201cthat he may make peace with Me; and he shall make\npeace with Me.\u201d Isaiah 27:5. Those who surrender their lives to His\nguidance and to His service will never be placed in a position for\nwhich He has not made provision. Whatever our situation, if we\nare doers of His word, we have a Guide to direct our way; what-\never our perplexity, we have a sure Counselor; whatever our sorrow, [249]\nbereavement, or loneliness, we have a sympathizing Friend.\n168 The Ministry of Healing\nIf in our ignorance we make missteps, the Saviour does not\nforsake us. We need never feel that we are alone. Angels are our\ncompanions. The Comforter that Christ promised to send in His\nname abides with us. In the way that leads to the City of God there\nare no difficulties which those who trust in Him may not overcome.\nThere are no dangers which they may not escape. There is not a\nsorrow, not a grievance, not a human weakness, for which He has\nnot provided a remedy.\nNone need abandon themselves to discouragement and despair.\nSatan may come to you with the cruel suggestion, \u201cYours is a hope-\nless case. You are irredeemable.\u201d But there is hope for you in Christ.\nGod does not bid us overcome in our own strength. He asks us to\ncome close to His side. Whatever difficulties we labor under, which\nweigh down soul and body, He waits to make us free.\nHe who took humanity upon Himself knows how to sympathize\nwith the sufferings of humanity. Not only does Christ know every\nsoul, and the peculiar needs and trials of that soul, but He knows\nall the circumstances that chafe and perplex the spirit. His hand is\noutstretched in pitying tenderness to every suffering child. Those\nwho suffer most have most of His sympathy and pity. He is touched\nwith the feeling of our infirmities, and He desires us to lay our\nperplexities and troubles at His feet and leave them there.\nIt is not wise to look to ourselves and study our emotions. If\nwe do this, the enemy will present difficulties and temptations that\nweaken faith and destroy courage. Closely to study our emotions and\ngive way to our feelings is to entertain doubt and entangle ourselves\nin perplexity. We are to look away from self to Jesus.\nWhen temptations assail you, when care, perplexity, and dark-[250]\nness seem to surround your soul, look to the place where you last\nsaw the light. Rest in Christ\u2019s love and under His protecting care.\nWhen sin struggles for the mastery in the heart, when guilt oppresses\nthe soul and burdens the conscience, when unbelief clouds the mind,\nremember that Christ\u2019s grace is sufficient to subdue sin and banish\nthe darkness. Entering into communion with the Saviour, we enter\nthe region of peace.\nMind Cure 169\nThe Healing Promises\n\u201cThe Lord redeemeth the soul of His servants:\nAnd none of them that trust in Him shall be desolate.\u201d\nPsalm 34:22.\n\u201cIn the fear of the Lord is strong confidence:\nAnd His children shall have a place of refuge.\u201d\nProverbs 14:26.\n\u201cZion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and\nThe Lord hath forgotten me.\nCan a woman forget her sucking child,\nThat she should not have compassion on the son of her\nwomb?\nYea, these may forget, yet will not I forget thee.\nBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of My hands.\u201d\nIsaiah 49:14-16, A.R.V .\n\u201cFear thou not; for I am with thee: [251]\nBe not dismayed; for I am thy God:\nI will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee;\nYea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of My righteous-\nness.\u201d\nIsaiah 41:10.\n\u201cYe that have been borne by Me from your birth,\nThat have been carried by Me from your earliest breath,\nEven to your old age I am the same;\nEven to hoar hairs I will carry you;\nI have done it, and I will still bear you;\nI will carry, and I will deliver you.\u201d\nIsaiah 46:3, 4, Noyes.\nNothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than\ndoes a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to resist\nmelancholy, discontented thoughts and feelings\u2014as much a duty\nas it is to pray. If we are heaven-bound, how can we go as a band\n170 The Ministry of Healing\nof mourners, groaning and complaining all along the way to our\nFather\u2019s house?\nThose professed Christians who are constantly complaining,\nand who seem to think cheerfulness and happiness a sin, have not\ngenuine religion. Those who take a mournful pleasure in all that\nis melancholy in the natural world, who choose to look upon dead\nleaves rather than to gather the beautiful living flowers, who see\nno beauty in grand mountain heights and in valleys clothed with\nliving green, who close their senses to the joyful voice which speaks\nto them in nature, and which is sweet and musical to the listening\near\u2014these are not in Christ. They are gathering to themselves gloom\nand darkness, when they might have brightness, even the Sun of\nRighteousness arising in their hearts with healing in His beams.\nOften your mind may be clouded because of pain. Then do not\ntry to think. You know that Jesus loves you. He understands your\nweakness. You may do His will by simply resting in His arms.\nIt is a law of nature that our thoughts and feelings are encouraged\nand strengthened as we give them utterance. While words express[252]\nthoughts, it is also true that thoughts follow words. If we would\ngive more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the blessings that\nwe know we have,\u2014the great mercy and love of God,\u2014we should\nhave more faith and greater joy. No tongue can express, no finite[253]\nmind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the\ngoodness and love of God. Even on earth we may have joy as a\nwellspring, never failing, because fed by the streams that flow from\nthe throne of God.\nThen let us educate our hearts and lips to speak the praise of\nGod for His matchless love. Let us educate our souls to be hopeful\nand to abide in the light shining from the cross of Calvary. Never\nshould we forget that we are children of the heavenly King, sons and\ndaughters of the Lord of hosts. It is our privilege to maintain a calm\nrepose in God.\n\u201cLet the peace of God rule in your hearts; ... and be ye thankful.\u201d\nColossians 3:15. Forgetting our own difficulties and troubles, let\nus praise God for an opportunity to live for the glory of His name.\nLet the fresh blessings of each new day awaken praise in our hearts\nfor these tokens of His loving care. When you open your eyes in\nthe morning, thank God that He has kept you through the night.\nMind Cure 171\nThank Him for His peace in your heart. Morning, noon, and night,\nlet gratitude as a sweet perfume ascend to heaven.\nWhen someone asks how you are feeling, do not try to think of\nsomething mournful to tell in order to gain sympathy. Do not talk\nof your lack of faith and your sorrows and sufferings. The tempter\ndelights to hear such words. When talking on gloomy subjects, you\nare glorifying him. We are not to dwell on the great power of Satan\nto overcome us. Often we give ourselves into his hands by talking of\nhis power. Let us talk instead of the great power of God to bind up\nall our interests with His own. Tell of the matchless power of Christ,\nand speak of His glory. All heaven is interested in our salvation. The\nangels of God, thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times\nten thousand, are commissioned to minister to those who shall be\nheirs of salvation. They guard us against evil and press back the\npowers of darkness that are seeking our destruction. Have we not\nreason to be thankful every moment, thankful even when there are [254]\napparent difficulties in our pathway?\nSing Praises\nLet praise and thanksgiving be expressed in song. When tempted,\ninstead of giving utterance to our feelings, let us by faith lift up a\nsong of thanksgiving to God.\nWe praise Thee, O God, for the Son of Thy love,\u2014\nFor Jesus who died and is now gone above.\nWe praise Thee, O God, for Thy Spirit of light,\nWho has shown us our Saviour, and scattered our night.\nAll glory and praise to the Lamb that was slain,\nWho has borne all our sins, and has cleansed every stain.\nAll glory and praise to the God of all grace,\nWho has bought us, and sought us, and guided our ways.\nRevive us again; fill each heart with Thy love;\nMay each soul be rekindled with fire from above.\n172 The Ministry of Healing\nChorus: Hallelujah! Thine the glory, Hallelujah! amen; Hallelu-\njah! Thine the glory, Revive us again.\nSong is a weapon that we can always use against discouragement.\nAs we thus open the heart to the sunlight of the Saviour\u2019s presence,\nwe shall have health and His blessing.\n\u201cGive thanks unto the Lord, for He is good: [255]\nFor His mercy endureth forever.\nLet the redeemed of the Lord say so,\nWhom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy.\u201d\n\u201cSing unto Him, sing psalms unto Him:\nTalk ye of all His wondrous works.\nGlory ye in His holy name:\nLet the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cFor He satisfieth the longing soul,\nAnd filleth the hungry soul with goodness.\nSuch as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,\nBeing bound in affliction and iron; ...\nThey cried unto the Lord in their trouble,\nAnd He saved them out of their distresses.\nHe brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd brake their bands in sunder.\nOh that men would praise the Lord for His goodness,\nAnd for His wonderful works to the children of men!\u201d\n\u201cWhy art thou cast down, O my soul?\nAnd why art thou disquieted within me?\nHope thou in God:\nFor I shall yet praise Him,\nWho is the health of my countenance,\nAnd my God.\u201d\nPsalm 107:1, 2; 105:2, 3;\nPsalm 107:9-15; 42:11.\n\u201cIn everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ\nJesus concerning you.\u201d 1 Thessalonians 5:18. This command is an\nMind Cure 173\nassurance that even the things which appear to be against us will\nwork for our good. God would not bid us be thankful for that which\nwould do us harm.\n\u201cThe Lord is my light and my salvation;\nWhom shall I fear?\nThe Lord is the strength of my life;\nOf whom shall I be afraid?\u201d\n\u201cIn the day of trouble He shall keep me secretly in His pavilion:\nIn the covert of His tabernacle shall He hide me; ...\nAnd I will offer in His tabernacle sacrifices of joy;\nI will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cI waited patiently for the Lord; [256]\nAnd He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.\nHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the\nmiry clay,\nAnd set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.\nAnd He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise\nunto our God.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord is my strength and my shield;\nMy heart trusted in Him, and I am helped:\nTherefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;\nAnd with my song will I praise Him.\u201d\nPsalm 27:1; 27:5, 6, R.V .;\n40:1-3; 28:7.\nOne of the surest hindrances to the recovery of the sick is the\ncentering of attention upon themselves. Many invalids feel that\neveryone should give them sympathy and help, when what they need\nis to have their attention turned away from themselves, to think of\nand care for others.\nOften prayer is solicited for the afflicted, the sorrowful, the\ndiscouraged; and this is right. We should pray that God will shed\nlight into the darkened mind and comfort the sorrowful heart. But\nGod answers prayer for those who place themselves in the channel\nof His blessings. While we offer prayer for these sorrowful ones,\nwe should encourage them to try to help those more needy than\n174 The Ministry of Healing\nthemselves. The darkness will be dispelled from their own hearts\nas they try to help others. As we seek to comfort others with the\ncomfort wherewith we are comforted, the blessing comes back to\nus.\nThe fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah is a prescription for maladies\nof the body and of the soul. If we desire health and the true joy of\nlife we must put into practice the rules given in this scripture. Of the\nservice acceptable to Him, and its blessings, the Lord says:\n\u201cIs it not to deal thy bread to the hungry,\nAnd that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house?\nWhen thou seest the naked, that thou cover him;\nAnd that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?\nThen shall thy light break forth as the morning, [257]\nAnd thine health shall spring forth speedily:\nAnd thy righteousness shall go before thee;\nThe glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward.\nThen shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer;\nThou shalt cry, and He shall say, Here I am.\nIf thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke,\nThe putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity;\nAnd if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry,\nAnd satisfy the afflicted soul;\nThen shall thy light rise in obscurity,\nAnd thy darkness be as the noonday:\nAnd the Lord shall guide thee continually,\nAnd satisfy thy soul in drought,\nAnd make fat thy bones:\nAnd thou shalt be like a watered garden,\nAnd like a spring of water,\nWhose waters fail not.\u201d\nIsaiah 58:7-11.\nGood deeds are twice a blessing, benefiting both the giver and\nthe receiver of the kindness. The consciousness of right-doing is\none of the best medicines for diseased bodies and minds. When\nthe mind is free and happy from a sense of duty well done and the\nMind Cure 175\nsatisfaction of giving happiness to others, the cheering, uplifting\ninfluence brings new life to the whole being.\nLet the invalid, instead of constantly requiring sympathy, seek\nto impart it. Let the burden of your own weakness and sorrow and\npain be cast upon the compassionate Saviour. Open your heart to\nHis love, and let it flow out to others. Remember that all have trials\nhard to bear, temptations hard to resist, and you may do something\nto lighten these burdens. Express gratitude for the blessings you\nhave; show appreciation of the attentions you receive. Keep the heart\nfull of the precious promises of God, that you may bring forth from\nthis treasure, words that will be a comfort and strength to others.\nThis will surround you with an atmosphere that will be helpful and\nuplifting. Let it be your aim to bless those around you, and you will [258]\nfind ways of being helpful, both to the members of your own family\nand to others.\nIf those who are suffering from ill-health would forget self in\ntheir interest for others; if they would fulfill the Lord\u2019s command to\nminister to those more needy than themselves, they would realize\nthe truthfulness of the prophetic promise, \u201cThen shall thy light break\nforth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily.\u201d\nMarah and Elim\nToday \u2019tis Elim with its palms and wells,\nAnd happy shade for desert weariness;\n\u2019Twas Marah yesterday, all rock and sand,\nUnshaded solitude and dreariness.\nYet the same desert holds them both, the same\nHot breezes wander o\u2019er the lonely ground;\nThe same low stretch of valley shelters both,\nAnd the same mountains compass them around.\nSo it is here with us on earth, and so\nI do remember it has ever been;\nThe bitter and the sweet, the grief and joy,\nLie near together, but a day between.\nSometimes God turns our bitter into sweet,\n176 The Ministry of Healing\nSometimes He gives us pleasant watersprings;\nSometimes He shades us with His pillar cloud,\nAnd sometimes to a blessed palm shade brings.\nWhat matters it? The time will not be long; [259]\nMarah and Elim will alike be passed;\nOur desert wells and palms will soon be done,\nWe reach the \u201cCity of our God\u201d at last.\nO happy land! beyond these lonely hills,\nWhere gush in joy the everlasting springs;\nO holy Paradise! above these heavens,\nWhere we shall end our desert wanderings.\n\u2014Horatius Bonar.\nBlessed Assurance\nBlessed assurance, Jesus is mine!\nOh, what a foretaste of glory divine!\nHeir of salvation, purchase of God,\nBorn of His Spirit, washed in His blood.\nChorus:\nThis is my story, this is my song,\nPraising my Saviour all the day long;\nThis is my story, this is my song,\nPraising my Saviour all the day long.\nPerfect submission, perfect delight,\nVisions of rapture now burst on my sight.\nAngels descending bring from above\nEchoes of mercy, whispers of love.\nPerfect submission, all is at rest,\nI in my Saviour am happy and blest,\nWatching and waiting, looking above,\nFilled with His goodness, lost in His love.\n\u2014Fanny J. Crosby.\nChapter 19\u2014In Contact With Nature [260]\n[261]\nThe Creator chose for our first parents the surroundings best\nadapted for their health and happiness. He did not place them in a\npalace or surround them with the artificial adornments and luxuries\nthat so many today are struggling to obtain. He placed them in close\ntouch with nature and in close communion with the holy ones of\nheaven.\nIn the garden that God prepared as a home for His children,\ngraceful shrubs and delicate flowers greeted the eye at every turn.\nThere were trees of every variety, many of them laden with fragrant\nand delicious fruit. On their branches the birds caroled their songs\nof praise. Under their shadow the creatures of the earth sported\ntogether without a fear.\nAdam and Eve, in their untainted purity, delighted in the sights\nand sounds of Eden. God appointed them their work in the garden,\n\u201cto dress it and to keep it.\u201d Genesis 2:15. Each day\u2019s labor brought\nthem health and gladness, and the happy pair greeted with joy the\nvisits of their Creator, as in the cool of the day He walked and talked\nwith them. Daily God taught them His lessons.\nThe plan of life which God appointed for our first parents has\nlessons for us. Although sin has cast its shadow over the earth, God [262]\ndesires His children to find delight in the works of His hands. The\nmore closely His plan of life is followed, the more wonderfully\nwill He work to restore suffering humanity. The sick need to be\nbrought into close touch with nature. An outdoor life amid natural\nsurroundings would work wonders for many a helpless and almost\nhopeless invalid.\nThe noise and excitement and confusion of the cities, their con-\nstrained and artificial life, are most wearisome and exhausting to the\nsick. The air, laden with smoke and dust, with poisonous gases, and\nwith germs of disease, is a peril to life. The sick, for the most part\nshut within four walls, come almost to feel as if they were prisoners\nin their rooms. They look out on houses and pavements and hurrying\n177\n178 The Ministry of Healing\ncrowds, with perhaps not even a glimpse of blue sky or sunshine, of\ngrass or flower or tree. Shut up in this way, they brood over their[263]\nsuffering and sorrow, and become a prey to their own sad thoughts.\nAnd for those who are weak in moral power, the cities abound in\ndangers. In them, patients who have unnatural appetites to overcome\nare continually exposed to temptation. They need to be placed\namid new surroundings where the current of their thoughts will be\nchanged; they need to be placed under influences wholly different\nfrom those that have wrecked their lives. Let them for a season be\nremoved from those influences that lead away from God, into a purer\natmosphere.\nInstitutions for the care of the sick would be far more successful\nif they could be established away from the cities. And so far as\npossible, all who are seeking to recover health should place them-\nselves amid country surroundings where they can have the benefit of\noutdoor life. Nature is God\u2019s physician. The pure air, the glad sun-[264]\nshine, the flowers and trees, the orchards and vineyards, and outdoor\nexercise amid these surroundings, are health-giving, life-giving.\nPhysicians and nurses should encourage their patients to be much\nin the open air. Outdoor life is the only remedy that many invalids\nneed. It has a wonderful power to heal diseases caused by the\nexcitements and excesses of fashionable life, a life that weakens and\ndestroys the powers of body, mind, and soul.\nHow grateful to the invalids weary of city life, the glare of many\nlights, and the noise of the streets, are the quiet and freedom of the\ncountry! How eagerly do they turn to the scenes of nature! How\nglad would they be to sit in the open air, rejoice in the sunshine,\nand breathe the fragrance of tree and flower! There are life-giving\nproperties in the balsam of the pine, in the fragrance of the cedar and\nthe fir, and other trees also have properties that are health restoring.\nTo the chronic invalid, nothing so tends to restore health and\nhappiness as living amid attractive country surroundings. Here the\nmost helpless ones can sit or lie in the sunshine or in the shade of the\ntrees. They have only to lift their eyes to see above them the beautiful\nfoliage. A sweet sense of restfulness and refreshing comes over them\nas they listen to the murmuring of the breezes. The drooping spirits\nrevive. The waning strength is recruited. Unconsciously the mind\nbecomes peaceful, the fevered pulse more calm and regular. As the\nIn Contact With Nature 179\nsick grow stronger, they will venture to take a few steps to gather\nsome of the lovely flowers, precious messengers of God\u2019s love to\nHis afflicted family here below.\nPlans should be devised for keeping patients out of doors. For\nthose who are able to work, let some pleasant, easy employment be\nprovided. Show them how agreeable and helpful this outdoor work\nis. Encourage them to breathe the fresh air. Teach them to breathe\ndeeply, and in breathing and speaking to exercise the abdominal [265]\nmuscles. This is an education that will be invaluable to them.\nExercise in the open air should be prescribed as a life-giving\nnecessity. And for such exercises there is nothing better than the\ncultivation of the soil. Let patients have flower beds to care for,\nor work to do in the orchard or vegetable garden. As they are\nencouraged to leave their rooms and spend time in the open air,\ncultivating flowers or doing some other light, pleasant work, their\nattention will be diverted from themselves and their sufferings.\nThe more the patient can be kept out of doors, the less care will\nhe require. The more cheerful his surroundings, the more helpful\nwill he be. Shut up in the house, be it ever so elegantly furnished,\nhe will grow fretful and gloomy. Surround him with the beautiful\nthings of nature; place him where he can see the flowers growing and\nhear the birds singing, and his heart will break into song in harmony\nwith the songs of the birds. Relief will come to body and mind. The\nintellect will be awakened, the imagination quickened, and the mind\nprepared to appreciate the beauty of God\u2019s word.\nIn nature may always be found something to divert the atten-\ntion of the sick from themselves and direct their thoughts to God.\nSurrounded by His wonderful works, their minds are uplifted from\nthe things that are seen to the things that are unseen. The beauty of\nnature leads them to think of the heavenly home, where there will [266]\nbe nothing to mar the loveliness, nothing to taint or destroy, nothing\nto cause disease or death.\nLet physicians and nurses draw from the things of nature, lessons\nteaching of God. Let them point the patients to Him whose hand\nhas made the lofty trees, the grass, and the flowers, encouraging\nthem to see in every bud and flower an expression of His love for\nHis children. He who cares for the birds and the flowers will care\nfor the beings formed in His own image.\n180 The Ministry of Healing\nOut of doors, amid the things that God has made, breathing the\nfresh, health-giving air, the sick can best be told of the new life in\nChrist. Here God\u2019s word can be read. Here the light of Christ\u2019s\nrighteousness can shine into hearts darkened by sin.\nO, could I find, from day to day, [267]\nA nearness to my God,\nThen would my hours glide sweet away,\nWhile leaning on His word.\nLord, I desire with Thee to live\nAnew from day to day,\nIn joys the world can never give,\nNor ever take away.\nBlest Jesus, come, and rule my heart,\nAnd make me wholly Thine,\nThat I may nevermore depart,\nNor grieve Thy love divine.\n\u2014Benjamin\nCleveland.\nMen and women in need of physical and spiritual healing are to\nbe thus brought into contact with those whose words and acts will\ndraw them to Christ. They are to be brought under the influence\nof the great Medical Missionary, who can heal both soul and body.\nThey are to hear the story of the Saviour\u2019s love, of the pardon freely\nprovided for all who come to Him confessing their sins.\nUnder such influences as these, many suffering ones will be\nguided into the way of life. Angels of heaven co-operate with\nhuman instrumentalities in bringing encouragement and hope and\njoy and peace to the hearts of the sick and suffering. Under such\nconditions the sick are doubly blessed, and many find health. The\nfeeble step recovers its elasticity. The eye regains its brightness. The\nhopeless become hopeful. The once despondent countenance wears\nan expression of joy. The complaining tones of the voice give place\nto tones of cheerfulness and content.\nAs physical health is regained, men and women are better able\nto exercise that faith in Christ which secures the health of the soul.\nIn Contact With Nature 181\nIn the consciousness of sins forgiven there is inexpressible peace\nand joy and rest. The clouded hope of the Christian is brightened. [268]\nThe words express the belief, \u201cGod is our refuge and strength, a very\npresent help in trouble.\u201d \u201cYea, though I walk through the valley of\nthe shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy\nrod and Thy staff they comfort me.\u201d \u201cHe giveth power to the faint;\nand to them that have no might He increaseth strength.\u201d Psalm 46:1;\n23:4; Isaiah 40:29.\nMy faith looks up to Thee,\nThou Lamb of Calvary,\nSaviour divine;\nNow hear me while I pray,\nTake all my guilt away,\nO let me from this day\nBe wholly Thine.\nMay Thy rich grace impart\nStrength to my fainting heart,\nMy zeal inspire;\nAs Thou hast died for me,\nO may my love to Thee\nPure, warm, and changeless be,\nA living fire.\nWhile life\u2019s dark maze I tread,\nAnd griefs around me spread,\nBe Thou my Guide;\nBid darkness turn to day,\nWipe sorrow\u2019s tears away,\nNor let me ever stray\nFrom Thee aside.\n\u2014Ray Palmer.\n182 The Ministry of Healing\nHealth Principles [269]\n[270]\n\u201cWithout a knowledge of health principles, no one is fitted for life\u2019s\nresponsibilities. \u201d\nChapter 20\u2014General Hygiene[271]\nThe knowledge that man is to be a temple for God, a habitation\nfor the revealing of His glory, should be the highest incentive to\nthe care and development of our physical powers. Fearfully and\nwonderfully has the Creator wrought in the human frame, and He\nbids us make it our study, understand its needs, and act our part in\npreserving it from harm and defilement.\nThe Circulation of the Blood\nIn order to have good health, we must have good blood; for the\nblood is the current of life. It repairs waste and nourishes the body.\nWhen supplied with the proper food elements and when cleansed\nand vitalized by contact with pure air, it carries life and vigor to\nevery part of the system. The more perfect the circulation, the better\nwill this work be accomplished.\nAt every pulsation of the heart the blood should make its way\nquickly and easily to all parts of the body. Its circulation should not\nbe hindered by tight clothing or bands, or by insufficient clothing of\nthe extremities. Whatever hinders the circulation forces the blood\nback to the vital organs, producing congestion. Headache, cough,[272]\npalpitation of the heart, or indigestion is often the result.\nRespiration\nIn order to have good blood, we must breathe well. Full, deep\ninspirations of pure air, which fill the lungs with oxygen, purify the\nblood. They impart to it a bright color and send it, a life-giving\ncurrent, to every part of the body. A good respiration soothes the\nnerves; it stimulates the appetite and renders digestion more perfect;\nand it induces sound, refreshing sleep.\nThe lungs should be allowed the greatest freedom possible.\nTheir capacity is developed by free action; it diminishes if they\nare cramped and compressed. Hence the ill effects of the practice\n184\nGeneral Hygiene 185\nso common, especially in sedentary pursuits, of stooping at one\u2019s [273]\nwork. In this position it is impossible to breathe deeply. Superficial\nbreathing soon becomes a habit, and the lungs lose their power to\nexpand. A similar effect is produced by tight lacing. Sufficient room\nis not given to the lower part of the chest; the abdominal muscles,\nwhich were designed to aid in breathing, do not have full play, and\nthe lungs are restricted in their action.\nThus an insufficient supply of oxygen is received. The blood\nmoves sluggishly. The waste, poisonous matter, which should be\nthrown off in the exhalations from the lungs, is retained, and the\nblood becomes impure. Not only the lungs, but the stomach, liver,\nand brain are affected. The skin becomes sallow, digestion is re-\ntarded; the heart is depressed; the brain is clouded; the thoughts are\nconfused; gloom settles upon the spirits; the whole system becomes\ndepressed and inactive, and peculiarly susceptible to disease.\nThe lungs are constantly throwing off impurities, and they need [274]\nto be constantly supplied with fresh air. Impure air does not afford\nthe necessary supply of oxygen, and the blood passes to the brain\nand other organs without being vitalized. Hence the necessity of\nthorough ventilation. To live in close, ill-ventilated rooms, where\nthe air is dead and vitiated, weakens the entire system. It becomes\npeculiarly sensitive to the influence of cold, and a slight exposure\ninduces disease. It is close confinement indoors that makes many\nwomen pale and feeble. They breathe the same air over and over\nuntil it becomes laden with poisonous matter thrown off through the\nlungs and pores, and impurities are thus conveyed back to the blood.\nVentilation and Sunlight\nIn the construction of buildings, whether for public purposes or\nas dwellings, care should be taken to provide for good ventilation\nand plenty of sunlight. Churches and schoolrooms are often faulty in\nthis respect. Neglect of proper ventilation is responsible for much of\nthe drowsiness and dullness that destroy the effect of many a sermon\nand make the teacher\u2019s work toilsome and ineffective.\nSo far as possible, all buildings intended for human habitation\nshould be placed on high, well-drained ground. This will ensure\na dry site and prevent the danger of disease from dampness and\n186 The Ministry of Healing\nmiasma. This matter is often too lightly regarded. Continuous ill-\nhealth, serious diseases, and many deaths result from the dampness\nand malaria of low-lying, ill-drained situations.\nIn the building of houses it is especially important to secure\nthorough ventilation and plenty of sunlight. Let there be a current of\nair and an abundance of light in every room in the house. Sleeping\nrooms should be so arranged as to have a free circulation of air day[275]\nand night. No room is fit to be occupied as a sleeping room unless it\ncan be thrown open daily to the air and sunshine. In most countries\nbedrooms need to be supplied with conveniences for heating, that\nthey may be thoroughly warmed and dried in cold or wet weather.\nThe guestchamber should have equal care with the rooms in-\ntended for constant use. Like the other bedrooms, it should have air\nand sunshine, and should be provided with some means of heating,\nto dry out the dampness that always accumulates in a room not in\nconstant use. Whoever sleeps in a sunless room, or occupies a bed\nthat has not been thoroughly dried and aired, does so at the risk of\nhealth, and often of life.\nIn building, many make careful provision for their plants and\nflowers. The greenhouse or window devoted to their use is warm and\nsunny; for without warmth, air, and sunshine, plants would not live\nand flourish. If these conditions are necessary to the life of plants,\nhow much more necessary are they for our own health and that of\nour families and guests!\nIf we would have our homes the abiding place of health and\nhappiness we must place them above the miasma and fog of the\nlowlands, and give free entrance to heaven\u2019s life-giving agencies.\nDispense with heavy curtains, open the windows and the blinds,\nallow no vines, however beautiful, to shade the windows, and permit\nno trees to stand so near the house as to shut out the sunshine. The\nsunlight may fade the drapery and the carpets, and tarnish the picture\nframes; but it will bring a healthy glow to the cheeks of the children.\nThose who have the aged to provide for should remember that\nthese especially need warm, comfortable rooms. Vigor declines as\nyears advance, leaving less vitality with which to resist unhealthful\ninfluences; hence the greater necessity for the aged to have plenty of\nsunlight, and fresh, pure air.\nScrupulous cleanliness is essential to both physical and mental[276]\nGeneral Hygiene 187\nhealth. Impurities are constantly thrown off from the body through\nthe skin. Its millions of pores are quickly clogged unless kept clean\nby frequent bathing, and the impurities which should pass off through\nthe skin become an additional burden to the other eliminating organs.\nMost persons would receive benefit from a cool or tepid bath\nevery day, morning or evening. Instead of increasing the liability to\ntake cold, a bath, properly taken, fortifies against cold, because it\nimproves the circulation; the blood is brought to the surface, and a\nmore easy and regular flow is obtained. The mind and the body are\nalike invigorated. The muscles become more flexible, the intellect\nis made brighter. The bath is a soother of the nerves. Bathing helps\nthe bowels, the stomach, and the liver, giving health and energy to\neach, and it promotes digestion.\nIt is important also that the clothing be kept clean. The garments\nworn absorb the waste matter that passes off through the pores; if\nthey are not frequently changed and washed, the impurities will be\nreabsorbed.\nEvery form of uncleanliness tends to disease. Death-producing\ngerms abound in dark, neglected corners, in decaying refuse, in\ndampness and mold and must. No waste vegetables or heaps of\nfallen leaves should be allowed to remain near the house to decay\nand poison the air. Nothing unclean or decaying should be tolerated\nwithin the home. In towns or cities regarded perfectly healthful,\nmany an epidemic of fever has been traced to decaying matter about\nthe dwelling of some careless householder.\nPerfect cleanliness, plenty of sunlight, careful attention to sani-\ntation in every detail of the home life, are essential to freedom from\ndisease and to the cheerfulness and vigor of the inmates of the home.\nChapter 21\u2014Hygiene Among the Israelites[277]\nIn the teaching that God gave to Israel, the preservation of health\nreceived careful attention. The people who had come from slavery\nwith the uncleanly and unhealthful habits which it engenders, were\nsubjected to the strictest training in the wilderness before entering\nCanaan. Health principles were taught and sanitary laws enforced.\nPrevention of Disease\nNot only in their religious service, but in all the affairs of daily\nlife was observed the distinction between clean and unclean. All\nwho came in contact with contagious or contaminating diseases were\nisolated from the encampment, and they were not permitted to return\nwithout thorough cleansing of both the person and the clothing. In\nthe case of one afflicted with a contaminating disease, the direction\nwas given:\n\u201cEvery bed, whereon he lieth, ... is unclean: and everything,\nwhereon he sitteth, shall be unclean. And whosoever toucheth his\nbed shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean\nuntil the even. And he that sitteth on anything whereon he sat ...\nshall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean\nuntil the even. And he that toucheth the flesh of him ... shall wash\nhis clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the[278]\neven.... And whosoever toucheth anything that was under him shall\nbe unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those things\nshall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean\nuntil the even. And whomsoever he toucheth ... and hath not rinsed\nhis hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in\nwater, and be unclean until the even. And the vessel of earth, that\nhe toucheth, ... shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be\nrinsed in water.\u201d Leviticus 15:4-12.\nThe law concerning leprosy is also an illustration of the thor-\noughness with which these regulations were to be enforced:\n188\nHygiene Among the Israelites 189\n\u201cAll the days wherein the plague shall be in him [the leper] he\nshall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the\ncamp shall his habitation be. The garment also that the plague of\nleprosy is in, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment;\nwhether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woolen; whether\nin a skin, or in anything made of skin; ... the priest shall look upon\nthe plague: ... if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the\nwarp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of\nskin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean. He shall therefore\nburn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or\nanything of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it\nshall be burnt in the fire.\u201d Leviticus 13:46-52.\nSo, too, if a house gave evidence of conditions that rendered it\nunsafe for habitation, it was destroyed. The priest was to \u201cbreak\ndown the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the\nmortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city\ninto an unclean place. Moreover he that goeth into the house all the [279]\nwhile that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. And he that\nlieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the\nhouse shall wash his clothes.\u201d Leviticus 14:45-47.\nCleanliness\nThe necessity of personal cleanliness was taught in the most\nimpressive manner. Before gathering at Mount Sinai to listen to\nthe proclamation of the law by the voice of God, the people were\nrequired to wash both their persons and their clothing. This direction\nwas enforced on pain of death. No impurity was to be tolerated in\nthe presence of God.\nDuring the sojourn in the wilderness the Israelites were almost\ncontinually in the open air, where impurities would have a less\nharmful effect than upon the dwellers in close houses. But the\nstrictest regard to cleanliness was required both within and without\ntheir tents. No refuse was allowed to remain within or about the\nencampment. The Lord said:\n\u201cThe Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver [280]\nthee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy\ncamp be holy.\u201d Deuteronomy 23:14.\n190 The Ministry of Healing\nDiet\nThe distinction between clean and unclean was made in all\nmatters of diet:\n\u201cI am the Lord thy God, which have separated you from other\npeople. Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and\nunclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not\nmake your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner\nof living thing, ... which I have separated from you as unclean.\u201d\nLeviticus 20:24, 25.\nMany articles of food eaten freely by the heathen about them\nwere forbidden to the Israelites. It was no arbitrary distinction that\nwas made. The things prohibited were unwholesome. And the fact\nthat they were pronounced unclean taught the lesson that the use of\ninjurious foods is defiling. That which corrupts the body tends to\ncorrupt the soul. It unfits the user for communion with God, unfits\nhim for high and holy service.\nIn the Promised Land the discipline begun in the wilderness was\ncontinued under circumstances favorable to the formation of right\nhabits. The people were not crowded together in cities, but each\nfamily had its own landed possession, ensuring to all the health-\ngiving blessings of a natural, unperverted life.\nConcerning the cruel, licentious practices of the Canaanites, who\nwere dispossessed by Israel, the Lord said:\n\u201cYe shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast\nout before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I\nabhorred them.\u201d Verse 23. \u201cNeither shalt thou bring an abomination[281]\ninto thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it.\u201d Deuteronomy\n7:26.\nIn all the affairs of their daily life, the Israelites were taught the\nlesson set forth by the Holy Spirit:\n\u201cKnow ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit\nof God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him\nshall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye\nare.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17.\nHygiene Among the Israelites 191\nRejoicing\n\u201cA merry [rejoicing] heart doeth good like a medicine.\u201d Proverbs\n17:22. Gratitude, rejoicing, benevolence, trust in God\u2019s love and\ncare\u2014these are health\u2019s greatest safeguard. To the Israelites they\nwere to be the very keynote of life.\nThe journey made three times a year to the annual feasts at\nJerusalem, the week\u2019s sojourn in booths during the Feast of Taberna-\ncles, were opportunities for outdoor recreation and social life. These\nfeasts were occasions of rejoicing, made sweeter and more tender\nby the hospitable welcome given to the stranger, the Levite, and the\npoor.\n\u201cRejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given\nunto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger\nthat is among you.\u201d Deuteronomy 26:11.\nSo, in later years, when the law of God was read in Jerusalem to\nthe captives returned from Babylon, and the people wept because of\ntheir transgressions, the gracious words were spoken:\n\u201cMourn not.... Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and\nsend portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day\nis holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the Lord is\nyour strength.\u201d Nehemiah 8:9, 10.\nAnd it was published and proclaimed \u201cin all their cities, and in [282]\nJerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches,\nand pine branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and\nbranches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written. So the\npeople went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths,\neveryone upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the\ncourts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in\nthe street of the gate of Ephraim. And all the congregation of them [283]\nthat were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under\nthe booths.... And there was very great gladness.\u201d Verses 15-17.\nGod gave to Israel instruction in all the principles essential to\nphysical as well as to moral health, and it was concerning these\nprinciples no less than concerning those of the moral law that He\ncommanded them:\n\u201cThese words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine\nheart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and\n192 The Ministry of Healing\nshalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou\nwalkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest\nup. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they\nshall be as frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them\nupon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.\u201d Deuteronomy 6:6-9.\n\u201cAnd when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What\nmean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the\nLord our God hath commanded you? Then thou shalt say unto thy\nson, ... The Lord commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the\nLord our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive,\nas it is at this day.\u201d Verses 20-24.\nHad the Israelites obeyed the instruction they received, and prof-\nited by their advantages, they would have been the world\u2019s object\nlesson of health and prosperity. If as a people they had lived accord-\ning to God\u2019s plan, they would have been preserved from the diseases\nthat afflicted other nations. Above any other people they would have\npossessed physical strength and vigor of intellect. They would have\nbeen the mightiest nation on the earth. God said:\n\u201cThou shalt be blessed above all people.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:14.\n\u201cThe Lord hath avouched thee this day to be His peculiar people,[284]\nas He hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all His\ncommandments; and to make thee high above all nations which\nHe hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou\nmayest be an holy people unto the Lord thy God, as He hath spoken.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 26:18, 19.\n\u201cAnd all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if\nthou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God. Blessed shalt\nthou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed\nshall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the\nfruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy\nsheep. Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store. Blessed shalt thou\nbe when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest\nout.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:2-6.\n\u201cThe Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy store-\nhouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and He shall\nbless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. The Lord\nshall establish thee an holy people unto Himself, as He hath sworn\nunto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the Lord thy God,\nHygiene Among the Israelites 193\nand walk in His ways. And all people of the earth shall see that thou\nart called by the name of the Lord; and they shall be afraid of thee.\nAnd the Lord shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy\nbody, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in\nthe land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee. The\nLord shall open unto thee His good treasure, the heaven to give the\nrain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine\nhand.... And the Lord shall make thee the head, and not the tail;\nand thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that\nthou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God, which I [285]\ncommand thee this day, to observe and to do them.\u201d Verses 8-13.\nTo Aaron the high priest and his sons the direction was given:\n\u201cOn this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto\nthem,\n\u201cJehovah bless thee, and keep thee:\nJehovah make His face to shine upon thee,\nAnd be gracious unto thee:\nJehovah lift up His countenance upon thee,\nAnd give thee peace.\nSo shall they put My name upon the children of Israel;\nAnd I will bless them.\u201d\n\u201cAs thy days, so shall thy strength be.\nThere is none like unto God, O Jeshurun,\nWho rideth upon the heaven for thy help,\nAnd in His excellency on the skies.\nThe eternal God is thy dwelling place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms....\nIsrael dwelleth in safety,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone,\n\u201cIn a land of corn and wine;\nYea, His heavens drop down dew.\nHappy art thou, O Israel:\nWho is like unto thee, a people saved by the Lord,\n194 The Ministry of Healing\nThe shield of thy help,\nAnd that is the sword of thy excellency!\u201d\nNumbers 6:23; 6:24-27,\nA.R.V .; Deuteronomy",

      "text": "The Israelites failed of fulfilling God\u2019s purpose, and thus failed\nof receiving the blessings that might have been theirs. But in Joseph\nand Daniel, in Moses and Elisha, and many others, we have noble\nexamples of the results of the true plan of living. Like faithfulness\ntoday will produce like results. To us it is written:\n\u201cYe are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation,[286]\na peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of Him who\nhath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d 1 Peter\n2:9.\n\u201cBlessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord,\nAnd whose hope the Lord is.\u201d\nHe \u201cshall flourish like the palm tree:\nHe shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.\nThose that be planted in the house of the Lord\nShall flourish in the courts of our God.\nThey shall still bring forth fruit in old age.\u201d\n\u201cThey shall be vigorous and covered with foliage.\u201d\n\u201cLet thine heart keep My commandments:\nFor length of days, and long life,\nAnd peace, shall they add to thee.\u201d\n\u201cThen shalt thou walk in thy way safely,\nAnd thy foot shall not stumble.\nWhen thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:\nYea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.\nBe not afraid of sudden fear,\nNeither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.\nFor the Lord shall be thy confidence,\nAnd shall keep thy foot from being taken.\u201d\nJeremiah 17:7; Psalm\n92:12-14; 92:14, Leeser;\nProverbs 3:1, 2, 23-26.\nChapter 22\u2014Dress [287]\nThe Bible teaches modesty in dress. \u201cIn like manner also, that\nwomen adorn themselves in modest apparel.\u201d 1 Timothy 2:9. This\nforbids display in dress, gaudy colors, profuse ornamentation. Any\ndevice designed to attract attention to the wearer or to excite ad-\nmiration, is excluded from the modest apparel which God\u2019s word\nenjoins.\nOur dress is to be inexpensive\u2014not with \u201cgold, or pearls, or\ncostly array.\u201d Verse 9.\nMoney is a trust from God. It is not ours to expend for the\ngratification of pride or ambition. In the hands of God\u2019s children it\nis food for the hungry, and clothing for the naked. It is a defense to\nthe oppressed, a means of health to the sick, a means of preaching\nthe gospel to the poor. You could bring happiness to many hearts\nby using wisely the means that is now spent for show. Consider the\nlife of Christ. Study His character, and be partakers with Him in His\nself-denial.\nIn the professed Christian world enough is expended for jewels\nand needlessly expensive dress to feed all the hungry and to clothe\nthe naked. Fashion and display absorb the means that might comfort\nthe poor and the suffering. They rob the world of the gospel of the [288]\nSaviour\u2019s love. Missions languish. Multitudes perish for want of\nChristian teaching. Beside our own doors and in foreign lands the\nheathen are untaught and unsaved. While God has laden the earth\nwith His bounties and filled its storehouses with the comforts of\nlife, while He has so freely given to us a saving knowledge of His\ntruth, what excuse can we offer for permitting the cries of the widow\nand the fatherless, the sick and the suffering, the untaught and the\nunsaved, to ascend to heaven? In the day of God, when brought\nface to face with Him who gave His life for these needy ones, what\nexcuse will those offer who are spending their time and money upon\nindulgences that God has forbidden? To such will not Christ say,\n\u201cI was an hungered, and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye\n195\n196 The Ministry of Healing\ngave Me no drink: ...naked, and ye clothed Me not: sick, and in\nprison, and ye visited Me not\u201d? Matthew 25:42, 43.\nBut our clothing, while modest and simple, should be of good\nquality, of becoming colors, and suited for service. It should be\nchosen for durability rather than display. It should provide warmth\nand proper protection. The wise woman described in the Proverbs\n\u201cis not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household\nare clothed with double garments.\u201d Proverbs 31:21, margin.\nOur dress should be cleanly. Uncleanliness in dress is unhealth-\nful, and thus defiling to the body and to the soul. \u201cYe are the temple\nof God....If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.\u201d\n1 Corinthians 3:16, 17.\nIn all respects the dress should be healthful. \u201cAbove all things,\u201d\nGod desires us to \u201cbe in health\u201d\u2014health of body and of soul. And\nwe are to be workers together with Him for the health of both soul\nand body. Both are promoted by healthful dress.\nIt should have the grace, the beauty, the appropriateness of natu-[289]\nral simplicity. Christ has warned us against the pride of life, but not\nagainst its grace and natural beauty. He pointed to the flowers of the\nfield, to the lily unfolding in its purity, and said, \u201cEven Solomon in\nall his glory was not arrayed like one of these.\u201d Matthew 6:29. Thus\nby the things of nature Christ illustrates the beauty that heaven val-\nues, the modest grace, the simplicity, the purity, the appropriateness,\nthat would make our attire pleasing to Him.\nThe most beautiful dress He bids us wear upon the soul. No\noutward adorning can compare in value or loveliness with that \u201cmeek\nand quiet spirit\u201d which in His sight is \u201cof great price.\u201d 1 Peter 3:4.\nTo those who make the Saviour\u2019s principles their guide, how\nprecious His words of promise:\n\u201cWhy are ye anxious concerning raiment? ... If God doth so\nclothe the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into\nthe oven, shall He not much more clothe you? ... Be not therefore\nanxious, saying, ... Wherewithal shall we be clothed? ... For your\nheavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But\nseek ye first His kingdom, and His righteousness; and all these things\nshall be added unto you.\u201d Matthew 6:28-33, R.V .\n\u201cThou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on\nThee: because he trusteth in Thee.\u201d Isaiah 26:3.\nDress 197\nWhat a contrast is this to the weariness, the unrest, the disease [290]\nand wretchedness, that result from the rule of fashion! How contrary\nto the principles given in the Scriptures are many of the modes of\ndress that fashion prescribes! Think of the styles that have prevailed\nfor the last few hundreds of years or even for the last few decades.\nHow many of them, when not in fashion, would be declared im-\nmodest; how many would be pronounced inappropriate for a refined,\nGod-fearing, self-respecting woman.\nThe making of changes in apparel for the sake of fashion merely\nis not sanctioned by the word of God. Changing styles and elaborate,\ncostly ornamentation squander the time and means of the rich, and\nlay waste the energies of mind and soul. They impose a heavy\nburden on the middle and poorer classes. Many who can hardly\nearn a livelihood, and who with simple modes might make their own\nclothing, are compelled to resort to the dressmaker in order to be\nin fashion. Many a poor girl, for the sake of a stylish gown, has\ndeprived herself of warm underwear, and paid the penalty with her\nlife. Many another, coveting the display and elegance of the rich,\nhas been enticed into paths of dishonesty and shame. Many a home\nis deprived of comforts, many a man is driven to embezzlement\nor bankruptcy, to satisfy the extravagant demands of the wife or\nchildren.\nMany a woman, forced to prepare for herself or her children\nthe stylish costumes demanded by fashion, is doomed to ceaseless\ndrudgery. Many a mother with throbbing nerves and trembling\nfingers toils far into the night to add to her children\u2019s clothing or-\nnamentation that contributes nothing to healthfulness, comfort, or\nreal beauty. For the sake of fashion she sacrifices health and that\ncalmness of spirit so essential to the right guidance of her children.\nThe culture of mind and heart is neglected. The soul is dwarfed.\nThe mother has no time to study the principles of physical devel- [291]\nopment, that she may know how to care for the health of her children.\nShe has no time for ministering to their mental or spiritual needs,\nno time to sympathize with them in their little disappointments and\ntrials, or to share in their interests and pursuits.\nAlmost as soon as they come into the world the children are\nsubjected to fashion\u2019s influence. They hear more of dress than of\ntheir Saviour. They see their mothers consulting the fashion plates\n198 The Ministry of Healing\nmore earnestly than the Bible. The display of dress is treated as of\ngreater importance than the development of character. Parents and\nchildren are robbed of that which is best and sweetest and truest in\nlife. For fashion\u2019s sake they are cheated out of a preparation for the\nlife to come.\nIt was the adversary of all good who instigated the invention\nof the ever-changing fashions. He desires nothing so much as to\nbring grief and dishonor to God by working the misery and ruin\nof human beings. One of the means by which he most effectually\naccomplishes this is the devices of fashion that weaken the body as\nwell as enfeeble the mind and belittle the soul.\nWomen are subject to serious maladies, and their sufferings are\ngreatly increased by their manner of dress. Instead of preserving\ntheir health for the trying emergencies that are sure to come, they\nby their wrong habits too often sacrifice not only health but life,\nand leave to their children a legacy of woe in a ruined constitution,\nperverted habits, and false ideas of life.\nOne of fashion\u2019s wasteful and mischievous devices is the skirt\nthat sweeps the ground. Uncleanly, uncomfortable, inconvenient,\nunhealthful\u2014all this and more is true of the trailing skirt. It is\nextravagant, both because of the superfluous material required and[292]\nbecause of the needless wear on account of its length. And whoever\nhas seen a woman in a trailing skirt, with hands filled with parcels,\nattempt to go up or down stairs, to enter a streetcar, to walk through\na crowd, to walk in the rain or on a muddy road, needs no other\nproof of its inconvenience and discomfort.\nAnother serious evil is the wearing of skirts so that their weight\nmust be sustained by the hips. This heavy weight, pressing upon\nthe internal organs, drags them downward and causes weakness\nof the stomach and a feeling of lassitude, inclining the wearer to\nstoop, which further cramps the lungs, making correct breathing\nmore difficult.\nOf late years the dangers resulting from compression of the waist\nhave been so fully discussed that few can be ignorant in regard to\nthem; yet so great is the power of fashion that the evil continues. By\nthis practice, women and young girls are doing themselves untold\nharm. It is essential to health that the chest have room to expand to\nits fullest extent in order that the lungs may be enabled to take full\nDress 199\ninspiration. When the lungs are restricted, the quantity of oxygen\nreceived into them is lessened. The blood is not properly vitalized,\nand the waste, poisonous matter which should be thrown off through\nthe lungs is retained. In addition to this the circulation is hindered,\nand the internal organs are so cramped and crowded out of place that\nthey cannot perform their work properly.\nTight lacing does not improve the form. One of the chief ele-\nments in physical beauty is symmetry, the harmonious proportion\nof parts. And the correct model for physical development is to be\nfound, not in the figures displayed by French modistes, but in the\nhuman form as developed according to the laws of God in nature.\nGod is the author of all beauty, and only as we conform to His ideal\nshall we approach the standard of true beauty.\nAnother evil which custom fosters is the unequal distribution of [293]\nthe clothing, so that while some parts of the body have more than\nis required, others are insufficiently clad. The feet and limbs, being\nremote from the vital organs, should be especially guarded from\ncold by abundant clothing. It is impossible to have health when the\nextremities are habitually cold; for if there is too little blood in them\nthere will be too much in other portions of the body. Perfect health\nrequires a perfect circulation; but this cannot be had while three or\nfour times as much clothing is worn upon the body, where the vital\norgans are situated, as upon the feet and limbs.\nA multitude of women are nervous and careworn because they\ndeprive themselves of the pure air that would make pure blood,\nand of the freedom of motion that would send the blood bounding\nthrough the veins, giving life, health, and energy. Many women\nhave become confirmed invalids when they might have enjoyed\nhealth, and many have died of consumption and other diseases when\nthey might have lived their allotted term of life had they dressed in\naccordance with health principles and exercised freely in the open\nair.\nIn order to secure the most healthful clothing, the needs of every\npart of the body must be carefully studied. The character of the\nclimate, the surroundings, the condition of health, the age, and the\noccupation must all be considered. Every article of dress should fit\neasily, obstructing neither the circulation of the blood nor a free, full,\n200 The Ministry of Healing\nnatural respiration. Everything worn should be so loose that when\nthe arms are raised the clothing will be correspondingly lifted.\nWomen who are in failing health can do much for themselves by\nsensible dressing and exercise. When suitably dressed for outdoor\nenjoyment, let them exercise in the open air, carefully at first, but\nincreasing the amount of exercise as they can endure it. By taking[294]\nthis course, many might regain health and live to take their share in\nthe world\u2019s work.\nIndependent of Fashion\nLet women themselves, instead of struggling to meet the de-\nmands of fashion, have the courage to dress healthfully and simply.\nInstead of sinking into a mere household drudge, let the wife and\nmother take time to read, to keep herself well informed, to be a\ncompanion to her husband, and to keep in touch with the developing\nminds of her children. Let her use wisely the opportunities now hers\nto influence her dear ones for the higher life. Let her take time to\nmake the dear Saviour a daily companion and familiar friend. Let\nher take time for the study of His word, take time to go with the\nchildren into the fields, and learn of God through the beauty of His\nworks.\nLet her keep cheerful and buoyant. Instead of spending every\nmoment in endless sewing, make the evening a pleasant social sea-\nson, a family reunion after the day\u2019s duties. Many a man would thus\nbe led to choose the society of his home before that of the clubhouse\nor the saloon. Many a boy would be kept from the street or the corner\ngrocery. Many a girl would be saved from frivolous, misleading\nassociations. The influence of the home would be to parents and\nchildren what God designed it should be, a lifelong blessing.\nChapter 23\u2014Diet and Health [295]\nOur bodies are built up from the food we eat. There is a constant\nbreaking down of the tissues of the body; every movement of every\norgan involves waste, and this waste is repaired from our food. Each\norgan of the body requires its share of nutrition. The brain must be\nsupplied with its portion; the bones, muscles, and nerves demand\ntheirs. It is a wonderful process that transforms the food into blood\nand uses this blood to build up the varied parts of the body; but this\nprocess is going on continually, supplying with life and strength\neach nerve, muscle, and tissue.\nSelection of Food\nThose foods should be chosen that best supply the elements\nneeded for building up the body. In this choice, appetite is not\na safe guide. Through wrong habits of eating, the appetite has\nbecome perverted. Often it demands food that impairs health and\ncauses weakness instead of strength. We cannot safely be guided by\nthe customs of society. The disease and suffering that everywhere\nprevail are largely due to popular errors in regard to diet.\nIn order to know what are the best foods, we must study God\u2019s\noriginal plan for man\u2019s diet. He who created man and who under- [296]\nstands his needs appointed Adam his food. \u201cBehold,\u201d He said, \u201cI\nhave given you every herb yielding seed, ... and every tree, in which\nis the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.\u201d Gene-\nsis 1:29, A.R.V . Upon leaving Eden to gain his livelihood by tilling\nthe earth under the curse of sin, man received permission to eat also\n\u201cthe herb of the field.\u201d Genesis 3:18.\nGrains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for\nus by our Creator. These foods, prepared in as simple and natural\na manner as possible, are the most healthful and nourishing. They\nimpart a strength, a power of endurance, and a vigor of intellect that\nare not afforded by a more complex and stimulating diet.\n201\n202 The Ministry of Healing\nBut not all foods wholesome in themselves are equally suited\nto our needs under all circumstances. Care should be taken in the[297]\nselection of food. Our diet should be suited to the season, to the\nclimate in which we live, and to the occupation we follow. Some\nfoods that are adapted for use at one season or in one climate are not\nsuited to another. So there are different foods best suited for persons\nin different occupations. Often food that can be used with benefit\nby those engaged in hard physical labor is unsuitable for persons of\nsedentary pursuits or intense mental application. God has given us\nan ample variety of healthful foods, and each person should choose\nfrom it the things that experience and sound judgment prove to be\nbest suited to his own necessities.\nNature\u2019s abundant supply of fruits, nuts, and grains is ample, and\nyear by year the products of all lands are more generally distributed\nto all, by the increased facilities for transportation. As a result many\narticles of food which a few years ago were regarded as expensive\nluxuries are now within the reach of all as foods for everyday use.\nThis is especially the case with dried and canned fruits.\nNuts and nut foods are coming largely into use to take the place[298]\nof flesh meats. With nuts may be combined grains, fruits, and\nsome roots, to make foods that are healthful and nourishing. Care\nshould be taken, however, not to use too large a proportion of nuts.\nThose who realize ill effects from the use of nut foods may find\nthe difficulty removed by attending to this precaution. It should be\nremembered, too, that some nuts are not so wholesome as others.\nAlmonds are preferable to peanuts, but peanuts in limited quantities,\nused in connection with grains, are nourishing and digestible.\nWhen properly prepared, olives, like nuts, supply the place of\nbutter and flesh meats. The oil, as eaten in the olive, is far preferable\nto animal oil or fat. It serves as a laxative. Its use will be found\nbeneficial to consumptives, and it is healing to an inflamed, irritated\nstomach.\nPersons who have accustomed themselves to a rich, highly stim-\nulating diet have an unnatural taste, and they cannot at once relish\nfood that is plain and simple. It will take time for the taste to become\nnatural and for the stomach to recover from the abuse it has suffered.\nBut those who persevere in the use of wholesome food will, after\na time, find it palatable. Its delicate and delicious flavors will be\nDiet and Health 203\nappreciated, and it will be eaten with greater enjoyment than can be\nderived from unwholesome dainties. And the stomach, in a healthy\ncondition, neither fevered nor overtaxed, can readily perform its [299]\ntask.\nIn order to maintain health, a sufficient supply of good, nourish-\ning food is needed.\nIf we plan wisely, that which is most conducive to health can\nbe secured in almost every land. The various preparations of rice,\nwheat, corn, and oats are sent abroad everywhere, also beans, peas,\nand lentils. These, with native or imported fruits, and the variety of\nvegetables that grow in each locality, give an opportunity to select a\ndietary that is complete without the use of flesh meats.\nWherever fruit can be grown in abundance, a liberal supply\nshould be prepared for winter, by canning or drying. Small fruits,\nsuch as currants, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, and black-\nberries, can be grown to advantage in many places where they are\nbut little used and their cultivation is neglected.\nFor household canning, glass, rather than tin cans, should be\nused whenever possible. It is especially necessary that the fruit for\ncanning should be in good condition. Use little sugar, and cook the\nfruit only long enough to ensure its preservation. Thus prepared, it\nis an excellent substitute for fresh fruit.\nWherever dried fruits, such as raisins, prunes, apples, pears,\npeaches, and apricots are obtainable at moderate prices, it will be\nfound that they can be used as staple articles of diet much more\nfreely than is customary, with the best results to the health and vigor\nof all classes of workers.\nThere should not be a great variety at any one meal, for this\nencourages overeating and causes indigestion.\nIt is not well to eat fruit and vegetables at the same meal. If\nthe digestion is feeble, the use of both will often cause distress and [300]\ninability to put forth mental effort. It is better to have the fruit at one\nmeal and the vegetables at another.\nThe meals should be varied. The same dishes, prepared in the\nsame way, should not appear on the table meal after meal and day\nafter day. The meals are eaten with greater relish, and the system is\nbetter nourished, when the food is varied.\n204 The Ministry of Healing\nPreparation of Food\nIt is wrong to eat merely to gratify the appetite, but no indiffer-\nence should be manifested regarding the quality of the food or the\nmanner of its preparation. If the food eaten is not relished, the body\nwill not be so well nourished. The food should be carefully chosen\nand prepared with intelligence and skill.\nFor use in breadmaking, the superfine white flour is not the\nbest. Its use is neither healthful nor economical. Fine-flour bread\nis lacking in nutritive elements to be found in bread made from\nthe whole wheat. It is a frequent cause of constipation and other\nunhealthful conditions.\nThe use of soda or baking powder in breadmaking is harmful and\nunnecessary. Soda causes inflammation of the stomach and often\npoisons the entire system. Many housewives think that they cannot [301]\nmake good bread without soda, but this is an error. If they would\ntake the trouble to learn better methods, their bread would be more\nwholesome, and, to a natural taste, it would be more palatable.\nIn the making of raised or yeast bread, milk should not be used\nin place of water. The use of milk is an additional expense, and it\nmakes the bread much less wholesome. Milk bread does not keep\nsweet so long after baking as does that made with water, and it\nferments more readily in the stomach.\nBread should be light and sweet. Not the least taint of sourness\nshould be tolerated. The loaves should be small and so thoroughly\nbaked that, so far as possible, the yeast germs shall be destroyed.\nWhen hot or new, raised bread of any kind is difficult of digestion. It\nshould never appear on the table. This rule does not, however, apply\nto unleavened bread. Fresh rolls made of wheaten meal without yeast\nor leaven, and baked in a well-heated oven, are both wholesome and\npalatable.\nGrains used for porridge or \u201cmush\u201d should have several hours\u2019\ncooking. But soft or liquid foods are less wholesome than dry foods,\nwhich require thorough mastication. Zwieback, or twice-baked\nbread, is one of the most easily digested and most palatable of foods.\nLet ordinary raised bread be cut in slices and dried in a warm oven\ntill the last trace of moisture disappears. Then let it be browned\nslightly all the way through. In a dry place this bread can be kept\nDiet and Health 205\nmuch longer than ordinary bread, and, if reheated before using, it\nwill be as fresh as when new.\nFar too much sugar is ordinarily used in food. Cakes, sweet\npuddings, pastries, jellies, jams, are active causes of indigestion.\nEspecially harmful are the custards and puddings in which milk,\neggs, and sugar are the chief ingredients. The free use of milk and [302]\nsugar taken together should be avoided.\nIf milk is used, it should be thoroughly sterilized; with this pre-\ncaution, there is less danger of contracting disease from its use.\nButter is less harmful when eaten on cold bread than when used\nin cooking; but, as a rule, it is better to dispense with it altogether.\nCheese is still more objectionable; it is wholly unfit for food.[The\nsafeguarding of the purity of all foods of dairy origin is a matter of\nprime importance. While frequent testing of dairy herds, together\nwith thorough pasteurization and refrigeration, serves to this end,\nsuch foods, if from uncertain sources, or if carelessly handled, con-\nstitute a serious menace to health; for, as stated in U.S. Department\nof Agriculture Farmers\u2019 Bulletin No. 1705 by a Government expert,\nRowena Schmidt Carpenter: \u201cThe same chemical constituents and\nphysical properties that recommend milk as a human food make\nit an excellent food for bacteria.\u201d The reader will understand that\nthe reference to cheese does not include cottage cheese or foods of\na similar character, which were ever recognized by the author as\nwholesome.\u2014Publishers.]\nScanty, ill-cooked food depraves the blood by weakening the\nblood-making organs. It deranges the system and brings on disease,\nwith its accompaniment of irritable nerves and bad tempers. The\nvictims of poor cookery are numbered by thousands and tens of\nthousands. Over many graves might be written: \u201cDied because of\npoor cooking;\u201d \u201cDied of an abused stomach.\u201d\nIt is a sacred duty for those who cook to learn how to prepare\nhealthful food. Many souls are lost as the result of poor cookery. It\ntakes thought and care to make good bread; but there is more religion\nin a loaf of good bread than many think. There are few really good\ncooks. Young women think that it is menial to cook and do other\nkinds of housework, and for this reason many girls who marry and\nhave the care of families have little idea of the duties devolving upon\na wife and mother.\n206 The Ministry of Healing\nCooking is no mean science, and it is one of the most essential\nin practical life. It is a science that all women should learn, and it[303]\nshould be taught in a way to benefit the poorer classes. To make food\nappetizing and at the same time simple and nourishing, requires skill;\nbut it can be done. Cooks should know how to prepare simple food\nin a simple and healthful manner, and so that it will be found more\npalatable, as well as more wholesome, because of its simplicity.\nEvery woman who is at the head of a family and yet does not\nunderstand the art of healthful cookery should determine to learn that\nwhich is so essential to the well-being of her household. In many\nplaces hygienic cooking schools afford opportunity for instruction\nin this line. She who has not the help of such facilities should put\nherself under the instruction of some good cook and persevere in her\nefforts for improvement until she is mistress of the culinary art.\nRegularity in eating is of vital importance. There should be a\nspecified time for each meal. At this time let everyone eat what\nthe system requires and then take nothing more until the next meal.\nThere are many who eat when the system needs no food, at irreg-\nular intervals, and between meals, because they have not sufficient\nstrength of will to resist inclination. When traveling, some are con-\nstantly nibbling if anything eatable is within their reach. This is very\ninjurious. If travelers would eat regularly of food that is simple and\nnutritious, they would not feel so great weariness nor suffer so much\nfrom sickness.\nAnother pernicious habit is that of eating just before bedtime.\nThe regular meals may have been taken; but because there is a sense\nof faintness, more food is eaten. By indulgence this wrong practice\nbecomes a habit and often so firmly fixed that it is thought impossible\nto sleep without food. As a result of eating late suppers, the digestive\nprocess is continued through the sleeping hours. But though the\nstomach works constantly, its work is not properly accomplished.\nThe sleep is often disturbed with unpleasant dreams, and in the[304]\nmorning the person awakes unrefreshed and with little relish for\nbreakfast. When we lie down to rest, the stomach should have\nits work all done, that it, as well as the other organs of the body,\nmay enjoy rest. For persons of sedentary habits, late suppers are\nparticularly harmful. With them the disturbance created is often the\nbeginning of disease that ends in death.\nDiet and Health 207\nIn many cases the faintness that leads to a desire for food is felt\nbecause the digestive organs have been too severely taxed during the\nday. After disposing of one meal, the digestive organs need rest. At\nleast five or six hours should intervene between the meals, and most\npersons who give the plan a trial will find that two meals a day are\nbetter than three.\nWrong Conditions of Eating [305]\nFood should not be eaten very hot or very cold. If food is cold,\nthe vital force of the stomach is drawn upon in order to warm it\nbefore digestion can take place. Cold drinks are injurious for the\nsame reason; while the free use of hot drinks is debilitating. In\nfact, the more liquid there is taken with the meals, the more difficult\nit is for the food to digest; for the liquid must be absorbed before\ndigestion can begin. Do not eat largely of salt, avoid the use of\npickles and spiced foods, eat an abundance of fruit, and the irritation\nthat calls for so much drink at mealtime will largely disappear.\nFood should be eaten slowly and should be thoroughly masti-\ncated. This is necessary in order that the saliva may be properly\nmixed with the food and the digestive fluids be called into action.\nAnother serious evil is eating at improper times, as after vio-\nlent or excessive exercise, when one is much exhausted or heated. [306]\nImmediately after eating there is a strong draft upon the nervous\nenergies; and when mind or body is heavily taxed just before or just\nafter eating, digestion is hindered. When one is excited, anxious, or\nhurried, it is better not to eat until rest or relief is found.\nThe stomach is closely related to the brain; and when the stomach\nis diseased, the nerve power is called from the brain to the aid of the\nweakened digestive organs. When these demands are too frequent,\nthe brain becomes congested. When the brain is constantly taxed,\nand there is lack of physical exercise, even plain food should be\neaten sparingly. At mealtime cast off care and anxious thought; do\nnot feel hurried, but eat slowly and with cheerfulness, with your\nheart filled with gratitude to God for all His blessings.\nMany who discard flesh meats and other gross and injurious arti-\ncles think that because their food is simple and wholesome they may\nindulge appetite without restraint, and they eat to excess, sometimes\n208 The Ministry of Healing\nto gluttony. This is an error. The digestive organs should not be\nburdened with a quantity or quality of food which it will tax the\nsystem to appropriate.\nCustom has decreed that the food shall be placed upon the table in\ncourses. Not knowing what is coming next, one may eat a sufficiency\nof food which perhaps is not the best suited to him. When the last\ncourse is brought on, he often ventures to overstep the bounds, and\ntake the tempting dessert, which, however, proves anything but good\nfor him. If all the food intended for a meal is placed on the table at\nthe beginning, one has opportunity to make the best choice.\nSometimes the result of overeating is felt at once. In other cases\nthere is no sensation of pain; but the digestive organs lose their vital\nforce, and the foundation of physical strength is undermined.\nThe surplus food burdens the system and produces morbid, fever-[307]\nish conditions. It calls an undue amount of blood to the stomach,\ncausing the limbs and extremities to chill quickly. It lays a heavy tax\non the digestive organs, and when these organs have accomplished\ntheir task, there is a feeling of faintness or languor. Some who are\ncontinually overeating call this all-gone feeling hunger; but it is\ncaused by the over-worked condition of the digestive organs. At\ntimes there is numbness of the brain, with disinclination to mental\nor physical effort.\nThese unpleasant symptoms are felt because nature has accom-\nplished her work at an unnecessary outlay of vital force and is thor-\noughly exhausted. The stomach is saying, \u201cGive me rest.\u201d But with\nmany the faintness is interpreted as a demand for more food; so\ninstead of giving the stomach rest, another burden is placed upon it.\nAs a consequence the digestive organs are often worn out when they\nshould be capable of doing good work.\nWe should not provide for the Sabbath a more liberal supply or\na greater variety of food than for other days. Instead of this the food\nshould be more simple, and less should be eaten in order that the\nmind may be clear and vigorous to comprehend spiritual things. A\nclogged stomach means a clogged brain. The most precious words\nmay be heard and not appreciated because the mind is confused by\nan improper diet. By overeating on the Sabbath, many do more than\nthey think to unfit themselves for receiving the benefit of its sacred\nopportunities.\nDiet and Health 209\nCooking on the Sabbath should be avoided; but it is not therefore\nnecessary to eat cold food. In cold weather the food prepared the\nday before should be heated. And let the meals, however simple,\nbe palatable and attractive. Especially in families where there are [308]\nchildren, it is well, on the Sabbath, to provide something that will\nbe regarded as a treat, something the family do not have every day.\nWhere wrong habits of diet have been indulged, there should be\nno delay in reform. When dyspepsia has resulted from abuse of the\nstomach, efforts should be made carefully to preserve the remaining\nstrength of the vital forces by removing every overtaxing burden.\nThe stomach may never entirely recover health after long abuse;\nbut a proper course of diet will save further debility, and many will\nrecover more or less fully. It is not easy to prescribe rules that will\nmeet every case; but, with attention to right principles in eating,\ngreat reforms may be made, and the cook need not be continually\ntoiling to tempt the appetite.\nAbstemiousness in diet is rewarded with mental and moral vigor;\nit also aids in the control of the passions. Overeating is especially\nharmful to those who are sluggish in temperament; these should\neat sparingly and take plenty of physical exercise. There are men\nand women of excellent natural ability who do not accomplish half [309]\nwhat they might if they would exercise self-control in the denial of\nappetite.\nMany writers and speakers fail here. After eating heartily, they\ngive themselves to sedentary occupations, reading, study, or writing,\nallowing no time for physical exercise. As a consequence the free\nflow of thought and words is checked. They cannot write or speak\nwith the force and intensity necessary in order to reach the heart;\ntheir efforts are tame and fruitless.\nThose upon whom rest important responsibilities, those, above\nall, who are guardians of spiritual interests, should be men of keen\nfeeling and quick perception. More than others, they need to be\ntemperate in eating. Rich and luxurious food should have no place\nupon their tables.\nEvery day men in positions of trust have decisions to make upon\nwhich depend results of great importance. Often they have to think\nrapidly, and this can be done successfully by those only who practice\nstrict temperance. The mind strengthens under the correct treatment\n210 The Ministry of Healing\nof the physical and mental powers. If the strain is not too great, new\nvigor comes with every taxation. But often the work of those who\nhave important plans to consider and important decisions to make[310]\nis affected for evil by the results of improper diet. A disordered\nstomach produces a disordered, uncertain state of mind. Often it\ncauses irritability, harshness, or injustice. Many a plan that would\nhave been a blessing to the world has been set aside, many unjust,\noppressive, even cruel measures have been carried, as the result of\ndiseased conditions due to wrong habits of eating.\nHere is a suggestion for all whose work is sedentary or chiefly\nmental; let those who have sufficient moral courage and self-control\ntry it: At each meal take only two or three kinds of simple food, and\neat no more than is required to satisfy hunger. Take active exercise\nevery day, and see if you do not receive benefit.\nStrong men who are engaged in active physical labor are not\ncompelled to be as careful as to the quantity or quality of their food\nas are persons of sedentary habits; but even these would have better\nhealth if they would practice self-control in eating and drinking.\nSome wish that an exact rule could be prescribed for their diet.\nThey overeat, and then regret it, and so they keep thinking about\nwhat they eat and drink. This is not as it should be. One person\ncannot lay down an exact rule for another. Everyone should exercise\nreason and self-control, and should act from principle.\nOur bodies are Christ\u2019s purchased possession, and we are not at\nliberty to do with them as we please. All who understand the laws of\nhealth should realize their obligation to obey these laws which God\nhas established in their being. Obedience to the laws of health is\nto be made a matter of personal duty. We ourselves must suffer the\nresults of violated law. We must individually answer to God for our\nhabits and practices. Therefore the question with us is not, \u201cWhat\nis the world\u2019s practice?\u201d but, \u201cHow shall I as an individual treat the\nhabitation that God has given me?\u201d\nChapter 24\u2014Flesh as Food [311]\nThe diet appointed man in the beginning did not include animal\nfood. Not till after the Flood, when every green thing on the earth\nhad been destroyed, did man receive permission to eat flesh.\nIn choosing man\u2019s food in Eden, the Lord showed what was the\nbest diet; in the choice made for Israel He taught the same lesson.\nHe brought the Israelites out of Egypt and undertook their training,\nthat they might be a people for His own possession. Through them\nHe desired to bless and teach the world. He provided them with\nthe food best adapted for this purpose, not flesh, but manna, \u201cthe\nbread of heaven.\u201d It was only because of their discontent and their\nmurmuring for the fleshpots of Egypt that animal food was granted\nthem, and this only for a short time. Its use brought disease and\ndeath to thousands. Yet the restriction to a nonflesh diet was never\nheartily accepted. It continued to be the cause of discontent and\nmurmuring, open or secret, and it was not made permanent.\nUpon their settlement in Canaan, the Israelites were permitted\nthe use of animal food, but under careful restrictions which tended [312]\nto lessen the evil results. The use of swine\u2019s flesh was prohibited,\nas also of other animals and of birds and fish whose flesh was pro-\nnounced unclean. Of the meats permitted, the eating of the fat and\nthe blood was strictly forbidden.\nOnly such animals could be used for food as were in good condi-\ntion. No creature that was torn, that had died of itself, or from which\nthe blood had not been carefully drained, could be used as food.\nBy departing from the plan divinely appointed for their diet, the\nIsraelites suffered great loss. They desired a flesh diet, and they\nreaped its results. They did not reach God\u2019s ideal of character or\nfulfill His purpose. The Lord \u201cgave them their request; but sent\nleanness into their soul.\u201d Psalm 106:15. They valued the earthly\nabove the spiritual, and the sacred pre-eminence which was His\npurpose for them they did not attain.\n211\n212 The Ministry of Healing\nReasons for Discarding Flesh Foods[313]\nThose who eat flesh are but eating grains and vegetables at sec-\nond hand; for the animal receives from these things the nutrition\nthat produces growth. The life that was in the grains and vegetables\npasses into the eater. We receive it by eating the flesh of the ani-\nmal. How much better to get it direct, by eating the food that God\nprovided for our use!\nFlesh was never the best food; but its use is now doubly objec-\ntionable, since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing. Those\nwho use flesh foods little know what they are eating. Often if they\ncould see the animals when living and know the quality of the meat\nthey eat, they would turn from it with loathing. People are continu-\nally eating flesh that is filled with tuberculous and cancerous germs.\nTuberculosis, cancer, and other fatal diseases are thus communi-\ncated.\nThe tissues of the swine swarm with parasites. Of the swine God\nsaid, \u201cIt is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch\ntheir dead carcass.\u201d Deuteronomy 14:8. This command was given[314]\nbecause swine\u2019s flesh is unfit for food. Swine are scavengers, and\nthis is the only use they were intended to serve. Never, under any\ncircumstances, was their flesh to be eaten by human beings. It is\nimpossible for the flesh of any living creature to be wholesome when\nfilth is its natural element and when it feeds upon every detestable\nthing.\nOften animals are taken to market and sold for food when they\nare so diseased that their owners fear to keep them longer. And some\nof the processes of fattening them for market produce disease. Shut\naway from the light and pure air, breathing the atmosphere of filthy\nstables, perhaps fattening on decaying food, the entire body soon\nbecomes contaminated with foul matter.\nAnimals are often transported long distances and subjected to\ngreat suffering in reaching a market. Taken from the green pastures,\nand traveling for weary miles over the hot, dusty roads, or crowded\ninto filthy cars, feverish and exhausted, often for many hours de-\nprived of food and water, the poor creatures are driven to their death,\nthat human beings may feast on the carcasses.\nFlesh as Food 213\nIn many places fish become so contaminated by the filth on\nwhich they feed as to be a cause of disease. This is especially the\ncase where the fish come in contact with the sewage of large cities. [315]\nThe fish that are fed on the contents of the drains may pass into\ndistant waters and may be caught where the water is pure and fresh.\nThus when used as food they bring disease and death on those who\ndo not suspect the danger.\nThe effects of a flesh diet may not be immediately realized; but\nthis is no evidence that it is not harmful. Few can be made to believe\nthat it is the meat they have eaten which has poisoned their blood\nand caused their suffering. Many die of diseases wholly due to meat\neating, while the real cause is not suspected by themselves or by\nothers.\nThe moral evils of a flesh diet are not less marked than are the\nphysical ills. Flesh food is injurious to health, and whatever affects\nthe body has a corresponding effect on the mind and the soul. Think\nof the cruelty to animals that meat eating involves, and its effect\non those who inflict and those who behold it. How it destroys the\ntenderness with which we should regard these creatures of God!\nThe intelligence displayed by many dumb animals approaches\nso closely to human intelligence that it is a mystery. The animals see\nand hear and love and fear and suffer. They use their organs far more\nfaithfully than many human beings use theirs. They manifest sym-\npathy and tenderness toward their companions in suffering. Many [316]\nanimals show an affection for those who have charge of them, far su-\nperior to the affection shown by some of the human race. They form\nattachments for man which are not broken without great suffering to\nthem.\nWhat man with a human heart, who has ever cared for domestic\nanimals, could look into their eyes, so full of confidence and affec-\ntion, and willingly give them over to the butcher\u2019s knife? How could\nhe devour their flesh as a sweet morsel?\nIt is a mistake to suppose that muscular strength depends on the\nuse of animal food. The needs of the system can be better supplied,\nand more vigorous health can be enjoyed, without its use. The grains,\nwith fruits, nuts, and vegetables, contain all the nutritive properties\nnecessary to make good blood. These elements are not so well or so\nfully supplied by a flesh diet. Had the use of flesh been essential to\n214 The Ministry of Healing\nhealth and strength, animal food would have been included in the\ndiet appointed man in the beginning.\nWhen the use of flesh food is discontinued, there is often a sense\nof weakness, a lack of vigor. Many urge this as evidence that flesh\nfood is essential; but it is because foods of this class are stimulating,\nbecause they fever the blood and excite the nerves, that they are so\nmissed. Some will find it as difficult to leave off flesh eating as it is\nfor the drunkard to give up his dram; but they will be the better for\nthe change.\nWhen flesh food is discarded, its place should be supplied with\na variety of grains, nuts, vegetables, and fruits that will be both\nnourishing and appetizing. This is especially necessary in the case\nof those who are weak or who are taxed with continuous labor. In\nsome countries where poverty abounds, flesh is the cheapest food.\nUnder these circumstances the change will be made with greater[317]\ndifficulty; but it can be effected. We should, however, consider the\nsituation of the people and the power of lifelong habit, and should\nbe careful not to urge even right ideas unduly. None should be urged\nto make the change abruptly. The place of meat should be supplied\nwith wholesome foods that are inexpensive. In this matter very much\ndepends on the cook. With care and skill, dishes may be prepared\nthat will be both nutritious and appetizing, and will, to a great degree,\ntake the place of flesh food.\nIn all cases educate the conscience, enlist the will, supply good,\nwholesome food, and the change will be readily made, and the\ndemand for flesh will soon cease.\nIs it not time that all should aim to dispense with flesh foods?\nHow can those who are seeking to become pure, refined, and holy,\nthat they may have the companionship of heavenly angels, continue\nto use as food anything that has so harmful an effect on soul and\nbody? How can they take the life of God\u2019s creatures that they\nmay consume the flesh as a luxury? Let them, rather, return to\nthe wholesome and delicious food given to man in the beginning,\nand themselves practice, and teach their children to practice, mercy\ntoward the dumb creatures that God has made and has placed under\nour dominion.\nChapter 25\u2014Extremes in Diet [318]\nNot all who profess to believe in dietetic reform are really reform-\ners. With many persons the reform consists merely in discarding\ncertain unwholesome foods. They do not understand clearly the\nprinciples of health, and their tables, still loaded with harmful dain-\nties, are far from being an example of Christian temperance and\nmoderation.\nAnother class, in their desire to set a right example, go to the\nopposite extreme. Some are unable to obtain the most desirable\nfoods, and, instead of using such things as would best supply the\nlack, they adopt an impoverished diet. Their food does not supply\nthe elements needed to make good blood. Their health suffers, their\nusefulness is impaired, and their example tells against, rather than\nin favor of, reform in diet.\nOthers think that since health requires a simple diet, there need\nbe little care in the selection or the preparation of food. Some restrict\nthemselves to a very meager diet, not having sufficient variety to\nsupply the needs of the system, and they suffer in consequence.\nThose who have but a partial understanding of the principles of\nreform are often the most rigid, not only in carrying out their views\nthemselves, but in urging them on their families and their neighbors. [319]\nThe effect of their mistaken reforms, as seen in their own ill-health,\nand their efforts to force their views upon others, give many a false\nidea of dietetic reform, and lead them to reject it altogether.\nThose who understand the laws of health and who are governed\nby principle, will shun the extremes, both of indulgence and of\nrestriction. Their diet is chosen, not for the mere gratification of\nappetite, but for the upbuilding of the body. They seek to preserve\nevery power in the best condition for highest service to God and\nman. The appetite is under the control of reason and conscience,\nand they are rewarded with health of body and mind. While they\ndo not urge their views offensively upon others, their example is a\n215\n216 The Ministry of Healing\ntestimony in favor of right principles. These persons have a wide\ninfluence for good.\nThere is real common sense in dietetic reform. The subject\nshould be studied broadly and deeply, and no one should criticize\nothers because their practice is not, in all things, in harmony with\nhis own. It is impossible to make an unvarying rule to regulate\neveryone\u2019s habits, and no one should think himself a criterion for[320]\nall. Not all can eat the same things. Foods that are palatable and\nwholesome to one person may be distasteful, and even harmful, to\nanother. Some cannot use milk, while others thrive on it. Some\npersons cannot digest peas and beans; others find them wholesome.\nFor some the coarser grain preparations are good food, while others\ncannot use them.\nThose who live in new countries or in poverty-stricken districts,\nwhere fruits and nuts are scarce, should not be urged to exclude\nmilk and eggs from their dietary. It is true that persons in full flesh\nand in whom the animal passions are strong need to avoid the use\nof stimulating foods. Especially in families of children who are\ngiven to sensual habits, eggs should not be used. But in the case of\npersons whose blood-making organs are feeble,\u2014especially if other\nfoods to supply the needed elements cannot be obtained,\u2014milk and\neggs should not be wholly discarded. Great care should be taken,\nhowever, to obtain milk from healthy cows, and eggs from healthy\nfowls, that are well fed and well cared for; and the eggs should be\nso cooked as to be most easily digested.\nThe diet reform should be progressive. As disease in animals\nincreases, the use of milk and eggs will become more and more\nunsafe. An effort should be made to supply their place with other[321]\nthings that are healthful and inexpensive. The people everywhere\nshould be taught how to cook without milk and eggs, so far as\npossible, and yet have their food wholesome and palatable.\nThe practice of eating but two meals a day is generally found a\nbenefit to health; yet under some circumstances persons may require\na third meal. This should, however, if taken at all, be very light, and\nof food most easily digested. \u201cCrackers\u201d\u2014the English biscuit\u2014or\nzwieback, and fruit, or cereal coffee, are the foods best suited for\nthe evening meal.\nExtremes in Diet 217\nSome are continually anxious lest their food, however simple\nand healthful, may hurt them. To these let me say, Do not think that\nyour food will injure you; do not think about it at all. Eat according\nto your best judgment; and when you have asked the Lord to bless\nthe food for the strengthening of your body, believe that He hears\nyour prayer, and be at rest.\nBecause principle requires us to discard those things that irritate\nthe stomach and impair health, we should remember that an impov-\nerished diet produces poverty of the blood. Cases of disease most\ndifficult to cure result from this cause. The system is not sufficiently\nnourished, and dyspepsia and general debility are the result. Those\nwho use such a diet are not always compelled by poverty to do so, [322]\nbut they choose it through ignorance or negligence, or to carry out\ntheir erroneous ideas of reform.\nGod is not honored when the body is neglected or abused and is\nthus unfitted for His service. To care for the body by providing for it\nfood that is relishable and strengthening is one of the first duties of\nthe householder. It is far better to have less expensive clothing and\nfurniture than to stint the supply of food.\nSome householders stint the family table in order to provide\nexpensive entertainment for visitors. This is unwise. In the enter-\ntainment of guests there should be greater simplicity. Let the needs\nof the family have first attention.\nUnwise economy and artificial customs often prevent the exercise\nof hospitality where it is needed and would be a blessing. The regular\nsupply of food for our tables should be such that the unexpected\nguest can be made welcome without burdening the housewife to [323]\nmake extra preparation.\nAll should learn what to eat and how to cook it. Men, as well as\nwomen, need to understand the simple, healthful preparation of food.\nTheir business often calls them where they cannot obtain wholesome\nfood; then, if they have a knowledge of cookery, they can use it to\ngood purpose.\nCarefully consider your diet. Study from cause to effect. Culti-\nvate self-control. Keep appetite under the control of reason. Never\nabuse the stomach by overeating, but do not deprive yourself of the\nwholesome, palatable food that health demands.\n218 The Ministry of Healing\nThe narrow ideas of some would-be health reformers have been\na great injury to the cause of hygiene. Hygienists should remember\nthat dietetic reform will be judged, to a great degree, by the provision\nthey make for their tables; and instead of taking a course that will\nbring discredit upon it, they should so exemplify its principles as\nto commend them to candid minds. There is a large class who will\noppose any reform movement, however reasonable, if it places a\nrestriction on the appetite. They consult taste instead of reason or\nthe laws of health. By this class, all who leave the beaten track of\ncustom and advocate reform will be accounted radical, no matter\nhow consistent their course. That these persons may have no ground[324]\nfor criticism, hygienists should not try to see how different they can\nbe from others, but should come as near to them as possible without\nthe sacrifice of principle.\nWhen those who advocate hygienic reform go to extremes, it is\nno wonder that many who regard these persons as representing health\nprinciples reject the reform altogether. These extremes frequently\ndo more harm in a short time than could be undone by a lifetime of\nconsistent living.\nHygienic reform is based upon principles that are broad and far-\nreaching, and we should not belittle it by narrow views and practices.\nBut no one should permit opposition or ridicule, or a desire to please\nor influence others, to turn him from true principles, or cause him\nlightly to regard them. Those who are governed by principle will be\nfirm and decided in standing for the right; yet in all their associations\nthey will manifest a generous, Christlike spirit and true moderation.\nChapter 26\u2014Stimulants and Narcotics [325]\nUnder the head of stimulants and narcotics is classed a great\nvariety of articles that, altogether used as food or drink, irritate the\nstomach, poison the blood, and excite the nerves. Their use is a\npositive evil. Men seek the excitement of stimulants, because, for\nthe time, the results are agreeable. But there is always a reaction.\nThe use of unnatural stimulants always tends to excess, and it is an\nactive agent in promoting physical degeneration and decay.\nCondiments\nIn this fast age, the less exciting the food, the better. Condiments\nare injurious in their nature. Mustard, pepper, spices, pickles, and\nother things of a like character, irritate the stomach and make the\nblood feverish and impure. The inflamed condition of the drunk-\nard\u2019s stomach is often pictured as illustrating the effect of alcoholic\nliquors. A similarly inflamed condition is produced by the use of irri-\ntating condiments. Soon ordinary food does not satisfy the appetite.\nThe system feels a want, a craving, for something more stimulating.\nTea and Coffee [326]\nTea acts as a stimulant and, to a certain extent, produces in-\ntoxication. The action of coffee and many other popular drinks is\nsimilar. The first effect is exhilarating. The nerves of the stomach\nare excited; these convey irritation to the brain, and this in turn is\naroused to impart increased action to the heart and short-lived energy\nto the entire system. Fatigue is forgotten; the strength seems to be\nincreased. The intellect is aroused, the imagination becomes more\nvivid.\nBecause of these results, many suppose that their tea or coffee is\ndoing them great good. But this is a mistake. Tea and coffee do not\nnourish the system. Their effect is produced before there has been\ntime for digestion and assimilation, and what seems to be strength\n219\n220 The Ministry of Healing\nis only nervous excitement. When the influence of the stimulant is\ngone, the unnatural force abates, and the result is a corresponding\ndegree of languor and debility.\nThe continued use of these nerve irritants is followed by\nheadache, wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, indigestion, trem-\nbling, and many other evils; for they wear away the life forces. Tired\nnerves need rest and quiet instead of stimulation and overwork. Na-[327]\nture needs time to recuperate her exhausted energies. When her\nforces are goaded on by the use of stimulants, more will be ac-\ncomplished for a time; but, as the system becomes debilitated by\ntheir constant use, it gradually becomes more difficult to rouse the\nenergies to the desired point. The demand for stimulants becomes\nmore difficult to control, until the will is overborne and there seems\nto be no power to deny the unnatural craving. Stronger and still\nstronger stimulants are called for, until exhausted nature can no\nlonger respond.\nThe Tobacco Habit\nTobacco is a slow, insidious, but most malignant poison. In\nwhatever form it is used, it tells upon the constitution; it is all\nthe more dangerous because its effects are slow and at first hardly[328]\nperceptible. It excites and then paralyzes the nerves. It weakens\nand clouds the brain. Often it affects the nerves in a more powerful\nmanner than does intoxicating drink. It is more subtle, and its effects\nare difficult to eradicate from the system. Its use excites a thirst for\nstrong drink and in many cases lays the foundation for the liquor\nhabit.\nThe use of tobacco is inconvenient, expensive, uncleanly, defiling\nto the user, and offensive to others. Its devotees are encountered\neverywhere. You rarely pass through a crowd but some smoker puffs\nhis poisoned breath in your face. It is unpleasant and unhealthful to\nremain in a railway car or in a room where the atmosphere is laden\nwith the fumes of liquor and tobacco. Though men persist in using\nthese poisons themselves, what right have they to defile the air that\nothers must breathe?\nAmong children and youth the use of tobacco is working un-\ntold harm. The unhealthful practices of past generations affect the\nStimulants and Narcotics 221\nchildren and youth of today. Mental inability, physical weakness,\ndisordered nerves, and unnatural cravings are transmitted as a legacy\nfrom parents to children. And the same practices, continued by the\nchildren, are increasing and perpetuating the evil results. To this\ncause in no small degree is owing the physical, mental, and moral [329]\ndeterioration which is becoming such a cause of alarm.\nBoys begin the use of tobacco at a very early age. The habit\nthus formed when body and mind are especially susceptible to its\neffects, undermines the physical strength, dwarfs the body, stupefies\nthe mind, and corrupts the morals.\nBut what can be done to teach children and youth the evils of\na practice of which parents, teachers, and ministers set them the\nexample? Little boys, hardly emerged from babyhood, may be seen\nsmoking their cigarettes. If one speaks to them about it, they say,\n\u201cMy father uses tobacco.\u201d They point to the minister or the Sunday-\nschool superintendent and say, \u201cSuch a man smokes; what harm for\nme to do as he does?\u201d Many workers in the temperance cause are\naddicted to the use of tobacco. What power can such persons have\nto stay the progress of intemperance?\nI appeal to those who profess to believe and obey the word\nof God: Can you as Christians indulge a habit that is paralyzing\nyour intellect and robbing you of power rightly to estimate eternal\nrealities? Can you consent daily to rob God of service which is His\ndue, and to rob your fellow men, both of service you might render\nand of the power of example?\nHave you considered your responsibility as God\u2019s stewards, for [330]\nthe means in your hands? How much of the Lord\u2019s money do you\nspend for tobacco? Reckon up what you have thus spent during\nyour lifetime. How does the amount consumed by this defiling lust\ncompare with what you have given for the relief of the poor and the\nspread of the gospel?\nNo human being needs tobacco, but multitudes are perishing for\nwant of the means that by its use is worse than wasted. Have you not\nbeen misappropriating the Lord\u2019s goods? Have you not been guilty\nof robbery toward God and your fellow men? \u201cKnow ye not that\n... ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore\nglorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God\u2019s.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 6:19, 20.\n222 The Ministry of Healing\nIntoxicating Drinks\n\u201cWine is a mocker, strong drink is raging:\nAnd whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.\u201d\n\u201cWho hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions?\nwho hath babbling? who hath wounds\nwithout cause?\nWho hath redness of eyes?\nThey that tarry long at the wine;\nThey that go to seek mixed wine.\nLook not thou upon the wine when it is red,\nWhen it giveth his color in the cup,\nWhen it moveth itself aright.\nAt the last it biteth like a serpent,\nAnd stingeth like an adder.\u201d\nProverbs 20:1; 23:29-32.\nNever was traced by human hand a more vivid picture of the\ndebasement and the slavery of the victim of intoxicating drink. En-\nthralled, degraded, even when awakened to a sense of his misery,\nhe has no power to break from the snare; he \u201cwill seek it yet again.\u201d\nVerse 35.\nNo argument is needed to show the evil effects of intoxicants on[331]\nthe drunkard. The bleared, besotted wrecks of humanity\u2014souls for\nwhom Christ died, and over whom angels weep\u2014are everywhere.\nThey are a blot on our boasted civilization. They are the shame and\ncurse and peril of every land.\nAnd who can picture the wretchedness, the agony, the despair,\nthat are hidden in the drunkard\u2019s home? Think of the wife, often\ndelicately reared, sensitive, cultured, and refined, linked to one\nwhom drink transforms into a sot or a demon. Think of the children,\nrobbed of home comforts, education, and training, living in terror of\nhim who should be their pride and protection, thrust into the world,\nbearing the brand of shame, often with the hereditary curse of the\ndrunkard\u2019s thirst.\nThink of the frightful accidents that are every day occurring\nthrough the influence of drink. Some official on a railway train\nneglects to heed a signal or misinterprets an order. On goes the train;\nStimulants and Narcotics 223\nthere is a collision, and many lives are lost. Or a steamer is run\naground, and passengers and crew find a watery grave. When the\nmatter is investigated, it is found that someone at an important post\nwas under the influence of drink. To what extent can one indulge the\nliquor habit and be safely trusted with the lives of human beings?\nHe can be trusted only as he totally abstains.\nThe Milder Intoxicants\nPersons who have inherited an appetite for unnatural stimulants\nshould by no means have wine, beer, or cider in their sight, or\nwithin their reach; for this keeps the temptation constantly before\nthem. Regarding sweet cider as harmless, many have no scruples in\npurchasing it freely. But it remains sweet for a short time only; then [332]\nfermentation begins. The sharp taste which it then acquires makes\nit all the more acceptable to many palates, and the user is loath to\nadmit that it has become hard, or fermented.\nThere is danger to health in the use of even sweet cider as ordi-\nnarily produced. If people could see what the microscope reveals\nin regard to the cider they buy, few would be willing to drink it.\nOften those who manufacture cider for the market are not careful\nas to the condition of the fruit used, and the juice of wormy and\ndecayed apples is expressed. Those who would not think of using\nthe poisonous, rotten apples in any other way, will drink the cider\nmade from them, and call it a luxury; but the microscope shows that\neven when fresh from the press, this pleasant beverage is wholly\nunfit for use. [When this statement was made in 1905, it was com-\nmon practice to manufacture cider as here described by the author.\nToday, in places where the purity of foods is not controlled, apple\ncider may still be made the same way. But where cider is produced\nunder sanitary conditions, using good, sound fruit, obviously the\nobjections disappear.\u2014Publishers.]\nIntoxication is just as really produced by wine, beer, and cider\nas by stronger drinks. The use of these drinks awakens the taste\nfor those that are stronger, and thus the liquor habit is established.\nModerate drinking is the school in which men are educated for\nthe drunkard\u2019s career. Yet so insidious is the work of these milder\n224 The Ministry of Healing\nstimulants that the highway to drunkenness is entered before the\nvictim suspects his danger.\nSome who are never considered really drunk are always under\nthe influence of mild intoxicants. They are feverish, unstable in\nmind, unbalanced. Imagining themselves secure, they go on and\non, until every barrier is broken down, every principle sacrificed.\nThe strongest resolutions are undermined, the highest considerations[333]\nare not sufficient to keep the debased appetite under the control of\nreason.\nThe Bible nowhere sanctions the use of intoxicating wine. The\nwine that Christ made from water at the marriage feast of Cana was\nthe pure juice of the grape. This is the \u201cnew wine ... found in the\ncluster,\u201d of which the Scripture says, \u201cDestroy it not; for a blessing\nis in it.\u201d Isaiah 65:8.\nIt was Christ who, in the Old Testament, gave the warning to\nIsrael, \u201cWine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is\ndeceived thereby is not wise.\u201d Proverbs 20:1. He Himself provided\nno such beverage. Satan tempts men to indulgence that will becloud\nreason and benumb the spiritual perceptions, but Christ teaches us to\nbring the lower nature into subjection. He never places before men\nthat which would be a temptation. His whole life was an example\nof self-denial. It was to break the power of appetite that in the forty\ndays\u2019 fast in the wilderness He suffered in our behalf the severest\ntest that humanity could endure. It was Christ who directed that John\nthe Baptist should drink neither wine nor strong drink. It was He\nwho enjoined similar abstinence upon the wife of Manoah. Christ\ndid not contradict His own teaching. The unfermented wine that He\nprovided for the wedding guests was a wholesome and refreshing\ndrink. This is the wine that was used by our Saviour and His disciples\nin the first Communion. It is the wine that should always be used\non the Communion table as a symbol of the Saviour\u2019s blood. The\nsacramental service is designed to be soul-refreshing and life-giving.\nThere is to be connected with it nothing that could minister to evil.\nIn the light of what the Scriptures, nature, and reason teach\nconcerning the use of intoxicants, how can Christians engage in the\nraising of hops for beer making, or in the manufacture of wine or[334]\ncider for the market? If they love their neighbor as themselves, how\ncan they help to place in his way that which will be a snare to him?\nStimulants and Narcotics 225\nOften intemperance begins in the home. By the use of rich,\nunhealthful food the digestive organs are weakened, and a desire\nis created for food that is still more stimulating. Thus the appetite\nis educated to crave continually something stronger. The demand\nfor stimulants becomes more frequent and more difficult to resist.\nThe system becomes more or less filled with poison, and the more\ndebilitated it becomes, the greater is the desire for these things. One\nstep in the wrong direction prepares the way for another. Many\nwho would not be guilty of placing on their table wine or liquor of\nany kind will load their table with food which creates such a thirst\nfor strong drink that to resist the temptation is almost impossible.\nWrong habits of eating and drinking destroy the health and prepare\nthe way for drunkenness.\nThere would soon be little necessity for temperance crusades if\nin the youth who form and fashion society, right principles in regard\nto temperance could be implanted. Let parents begin a crusade\nagainst intemperance at their own firesides, in the principles they\nteach their children to follow from infancy, and they may hope for\nsuccess.\nThere is work for mothers in helping their children to form cor-\nrect habits and pure tastes. Educate the appetite; teach the children\nto abhor stimulants. Bring your children up to have moral stamina\nto resist the evil that surrounds them. Teach them that they are not to\nbe swayed by others, that they are not to yield to strong influences,\nbut to influence others for good.\nGreat efforts are made to put down intemperance; but there is\nmuch effort that is not directed to the right point. The advocates\nof temperance reform should be awake to the evils resulting from\nthe use of unwholesome food, condiments, tea, and coffee. We bid [335]\nall temperance workers Godspeed; but we invite them to look more\ndeeply into the cause of the evil they war against and to be sure that\nthey are consistent in reform.\nIt must be kept before the people that the right balance of the\nmental and moral powers depends in a great degree on the right con-\ndition of the physical system. All narcotics and unnatural stimulants\nthat enfeeble and degrade the physical nature tend to lower the tone\nof the intellect and morals. Intemperance lies at the foundation of\n226 The Ministry of Healing\nthe moral depravity of the world. By the indulgence of perverted\nappetite, man loses his power to resist temptation.\nTemperance reformers have a work to do in educating the people\nin these lines. Teach them that health, character, and even life, are\nendangered by the use of stimulants, which excite the exhausted\nenergies to unnatural, spasmodic action.\nIn relation to tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcoholic drinks, the only\nsafe course is to touch not, taste not, handle not. The tendency of tea,\ncoffee, and similar drinks is in the same direction as that of alcoholic\nliquor and tobacco, and in some cases the habit is as difficult to\nbreak as it is for the drunkard to give up intoxicants. Those who\nattempt to leave off these stimulants will for a time feel a loss and\nwill suffer without them. But by persistence they will overcome the\ncraving and cease to feel the lack. Nature may require a little time\nto recover from the abuse she has suffered; but give her a chance,\nand she will again rally and perform her work nobly and well.\nChapter 27\u2014Liquor Traffic and Prohibition [336]\n[337]\n\u201cWoe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and\nhis chambers by wrong; ... that saith, I will build me a wide house\nand large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled\nwith cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign, because\nthou closest thyself in cedar? ... Thine eyes and thine heart are not\nbut for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for\noppression, and for violence, to do it.\u201d Jeremiah 22:13-17.\nThe Work of the Liquor Seller\nThis scripture pictures the work of those who manufacture and\nwho sell intoxicating liquor. Their business means robbery. For the\nmoney they receive, no equivalent is returned. Every dollar they add\nto their gains has brought a curse to the spender.\nWith a liberal hand, God has bestowed His blessings upon men.\nIf His gifts were wisely used, how little the world would know\nof poverty or distress! It is the wickedness of men that turns His\nblessings into a curse. It is through the greed of gain and the lust\nof appetite that the grains and fruits given for our sustenance are\nconverted into poisons that bring misery and ruin.\nEvery year millions upon millions of gallons of intoxicating [338]\nliquors are consumed. Millions upon millions of dollars are spent in\nbuying wretchedness, poverty, disease, degradation, lust, crime, and\ndeath. For the sake of gain, the liquor seller deals out to his victims\nthat which corrupts and destroys mind and body. He entails on the\ndrunkard\u2019s family poverty and wretchedness.\nWhen his victim is dead, the rum seller\u2019s exactions do not cease.\nHe robs the widow and brings children to beggary. He does not\nhesitate to take the very necessaries of life from the destitute family,\nto pay the drink bill of the husband and father. The cries of the\nsuffering children, the tears of the agonized mother, serve only to\nexasperate him. What is it to him if these suffering ones starve?\n227\n228 The Ministry of Healing\nWhat is it to him if they, too, are driven to degradation and ruin? He\ngrows rich on the pittances of those whom he is leading to perdition.\nHouses of prostitution, dens of vice, criminal courts, prisons,\nalmshouses, insane asylums, hospitals, all are, to a great degree,\nfilled as a result of the liquor seller\u2019s work. Like the mystic Babylon\nof the Apocalypse, he is dealing in \u201cslaves, and souls of men.\u201d\nBehind the liquor seller stands the mighty destroyer of souls, and\nevery art which earth or hell can devise is employed to draw human\nbeings under his power. In the city and the country, on the railway\ntrains, on the great steamers, in places of business, in the halls of\npleasure, in the medical dispensary, even in the church, on the sacred\nCommunion table, his traps are set. Nothing is left undone to create\nand to foster the desire for intoxicants. On almost every corner\nstands the public house, with its brilliant lights, its welcome and\ngood cheer, inviting the working man, the wealthy idler, and the\nunsuspecting youth.\nIn private lunchrooms and fashionable resorts, ladies are sup-\nplied with popular drinks, under some pleasing name, that are really\nintoxicants. For the sick and the exhausted, there are the widely[339]\nadvertised bitters, consisting largely of alcohol.\nTo create the liquor appetite in little children, alcohol is intro-\nduced into confectionery. Such confectionery is sold in the shops.\nAnd by the gift of these candies the liquor seller entices children\ninto his resorts.\nDay by day, month by month, year by year, the work goes on.\nFathers and husbands and brothers, the stay and hope and pride of\nthe nation, are steadily passing into the liquor dealer\u2019s haunts, to be\nsent back wrecked and ruined.\nMore terrible still, the curse is striking the very heart of the home.\nMore and more, women are forming the liquor habit. In many a\nhousehold, little children, even in the innocence and helplessness\nof babyhood, are in daily peril through the neglect, the abuse, the\nvileness of drunken mothers. Sons and daughters are growing up\nunder the shadow of this terrible evil. What outlook for their future\nbut that they will sink even lower than their parents?\nFrom so-called Christian lands the curse is carried to the re-\ngions of idolatry. The poor, ignorant savages are taught the use of\nliquor. Even among the heathen, men of intelligence recognize and\nLiquor Traffic and Prohibition 229\nprotest against it as a deadly poison; but in vain have they sought\nto protect their lands from its ravages. By civilized peoples, to-\nbacco, liquor, and opium are forced upon the heathen nations. The\nungoverned passions of the savage, stimulated by drink, drag him\ndown to degradation before unknown, and it becomes an almost\nhopeless undertaking to send missionaries to these lands.\nThrough their contact with peoples who should have given them\na knowledge of God, the heathen are led into vices which are proving\nthe destruction of whole tribes and races. And in the dark places of\nthe earth the men of civilized nations are hated because of this.\nThe Responsibility of the Church [340]\nThe liquor interest is a power in the world. It has on its side\nthe combined strength of money, habit, appetite. Its power is felt\neven in the church. Men whose money has been made, directly\nor indirectly, in the liquor traffic, are members of churches, \u201cin\ngood and regular standing.\u201d Many of them give liberally to popular\ncharities. Their contributions help to support the enterprises of the\nchurch and to sustain its ministers. They command the consideration\nshown to the money power. Churches that accept such members are\nvirtually sustaining the liquor traffic. Too often the minister has not\nthe courage to stand for the right. He does not declare to his people\nwhat God has said concerning the work of the liquor seller. To speak\nplainly would mean the offending of his congregation, the sacrifice\nof his popularity, the loss of his salary.\nBut above the tribunal of the church is the tribunal of God. He\nwho declared to the first murderer, \u201cThe voice of thy brother\u2019s blood\ncrieth unto Me from the ground\u201d (Genesis 4:10), will not accept for\nHis altar the gifts of the liquor dealer. His anger is kindled against\nthose who attempt to cover their guilt with a cloak of liberality. Their\nmoney is stained with blood. A curse is upon it.\n\u201cTo what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices [341]\nunto Me? saith the Lord....\nWhen ye come to appear before Me,\nWho hath required this at your hand, to tread My courts?\nBring no more vain oblation ....\n230 The Ministry of Healing\nWhen ye spread forth your hands,\nI will hide Mine eyes from you:\nYea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:\nYour hands are full of blood.\u201d\nIsaiah 1:11-15.\nThe drunkard is capable of better things. He has been entrusted\nwith talents with which to honor God and bless the world; but his\nfellow men have laid a snare for his soul and built themselves up by\nhis degradation. They have lived in luxury while the poor victims\nwhom they have robbed, lived in poverty and wretchedness. But\nGod will require for this at the hand of him who has helped to speed\nthe drunkard on to ruin. He who rules in the heavens has not lost\nsight of the first cause or the last effect of drunkenness. He who has\na care for the sparrow and clothes the grass of the field, will not pass\nby those who have been formed in His own image, purchased with\nHis own blood, and pay no heed to their cries. God marks all this\nwickedness that perpetuates crime and misery.\nThe world and the church may have approval for the man who\nhas gained wealth by degrading the human soul. They may smile\nupon him by whom men are led down step by step in the path of\nshame and degradation. But God notes it all and renders a just\njudgment. The liquor seller may be termed by the world a good\nbusinessman; but the Lord says, \u201cWoe unto him.\u201d He will be charged\nwith the hopelessness, the misery, the suffering, brought into the\nworld by the liquor traffic. He will have to answer for the want and\nwoe of the mothers and children who have suffered for food and\nclothing and shelter, and who have buried all hope and joy. He will[342]\nhave to answer for the souls he has sent unprepared into eternity.\nAnd those who sustain the liquor seller in his work are sharers in his\nguilt. To them God says, \u201cYour hands are full of blood.\u201d\nLicense Laws\nThe licensing of the liquor traffic is advocated by many as tend-\ning to restrict the drink evil. But the licensing of the traffic places it\nunder the protection of law. The government sanctions its existence,\nand thus fosters the evil which it professes to restrict. Under the\nLiquor Traffic and Prohibition 231\nprotection of license laws, breweries, distilleries, and wineries are\nplanted all over the land, and the liquor seller plies his work beside\nour very doors.\nOften he is forbidden to sell intoxicants to one who is drunk or\nwho is known to be a confirmed drunkard; but the work of making\ndrunkards of the youth goes steadily forward. Upon the creating of\nthe liquor appetite in the youth the very life of the traffic depends.\nThe youth are led on, step by step, until the liquor habit is established\nand the thirst is created that at any cost demands satisfaction. Less\nharmful would it be to grant liquor to the confirmed drunkard, whose\nruin, in most cases, is already determined, than to permit the flower\nof our youth to be lured to destruction through this terrible habit.\nBy the licensing of the liquor traffic, temptation is kept con-\nstantly before those who are trying to reform. Institutions have been\nestablished where the victims of intemperance may be helped to\novercome their appetite. This is a noble work; but so long as the sale\nof liquor is sanctioned by law, the intemperate receive little benefit\nfrom inebriate asylums. They cannot remain there always. They\nmust again take their place in society. The appetite for intoxicating [343]\ndrink, though subdued, is not wholly destroyed; and when tempta-\ntion assails them, as it does on every hand, they too often fall an\neasy prey.\nThe man who has a vicious beast and who, knowing its dispo-\nsition, allows it liberty, is by the laws of the land held accountable\nfor the evil the beast may do. In the laws given to Israel the Lord\ndirected that when a beast known to be vicious caused the death\nof a human being, the life of the owner should pay the price of his\ncarelessness or malignity. On the same principle the government that\nlicenses the liquor seller should be held responsible for the results\nof his traffic. And if it is a crime worthy of death to give liberty to\na vicious beast, how much greater is the crime of sanctioning the\nwork of the liquor seller!\nLicenses are granted on the plea that they bring a revenue to\nthe public treasury. But what is this revenue when compared with\nthe enormous expense incurred for the criminals, the insane, the\npaupers, that are the fruit of the liquor traffic! A man under the\ninfluence of liquor commits a crime; he is brought into court; and [344]\nthose who legalized the traffic are forced to deal with the result of\n232 The Ministry of Healing\ntheir own work. They authorized the sale of a draft that would make\na sane man mad; and now it is necessary for them to send the man\nto prison or to the gallows, while often his wife and children are left\ndestitute to become the charge of the community in which they live.\nConsidering only the financial aspect of the question, what folly\nit is to tolerate such a business! But what revenue can compensate\nfor the loss of human reason, for the defacing and deforming of the\nimage of God in man, for the ruin of children, reduced to pauperism\nand degradation, to perpetuate in their children the evil tendencies\nof their drunken fathers?\nProhibition\nThe man who has formed the habit of using intoxicants is in a\ndesperate situation. His brain is diseased, his will power is weak-\nened. So far as any power in himself is concerned, his appetite is\nuncontrollable. He cannot be reasoned with or persuaded to deny\nhimself. Drawn into the dens of vice, one who has resolved to quit\ndrink is led to seize the glass again, and with the first taste of the\nintoxicant every good resolution is overpowered, every vestige of\nwill destroyed. One taste of the maddening draft, and all thought\nof its results has vanished. The heartbroken wife is forgotten. The\ndebauched father no longer cares that his children are hungry and\nnaked. By legalizing the traffic, the law gives its sanction to this\ndownfall of the soul and refuses to stop the trade that fills the world\nwith evil.\nMust this always continue? Will souls always have to struggle for\nvictory, with the door of temptation wide open before them? Must\nthe curse of intemperance forever rest like a blight upon the civilized\nworld? Must it continue to sweep, every year, like a devouring fire\nover thousands of happy homes? When a ship is wrecked in sight of\nshore, people do not idly look on. They risk their lives in the effort[345]\nto rescue men and women from a watery grave. How much greater\nthe demand for effort in rescuing them from the drunkard\u2019s fate!\nIt is not the drunkard and his family alone who are imperiled by\nthe work of the liquor seller, nor is the burden of taxation the chief\nevil which his traffic brings on the community. We are all woven\nLiquor Traffic and Prohibition 233\ntogether in the web of humanity. The evil that befalls any part of the\ngreat human brotherhood brings peril to all.\nMany a man who through love of gain or ease would have noth-\ning to do with restricting the liquor traffic has found, too late, that\nthe traffic had to do with him. He has seen his own children besotted\nand ruined. Lawlessness runs riot. Property is in danger. Life is\nunsafe. Accidents by sea and by land multiply. Diseases that breed\nin the haunts of filth and wretchedness make their way to lordly\nand luxurious homes. Vices fostered by the children of debauch-\nery and crime infect the sons and daughters of refined and cultured\nhouseholds.\nThere is no man whose interests the liquor traffic does not im-\nperil. There is no man who for his own safeguard should not set\nhimself to destroy it.\nAbove all other places having to do with secular interests only,\nlegislative halls and courts of justice should be free from the curse\nof intemperance. Governors, senators, representatives, judges, men\nwho enact and administer a nation\u2019s laws, men who hold in their\nhands the lives, the fair fame, the possessions of their fellows, should\nbe men of strict temperance. Only thus can their minds be clear to\ndiscriminate between right and wrong. Only thus can they possess\nfirmness of principle, and wisdom to administer justice and to show\nmercy. But how does the record stand? How many of these men have\ntheir minds beclouded, their sense of right and wrong confused, by\nstrong drink! How many are the oppressive laws enacted, how many [346]\nthe innocent persons condemned to death, through the injustice of\ndrinking lawmakers, witnesses, jurors, lawyers, and even judges!\nMany there are, \u201cmighty to drink wine,\u201d and \u201cmen of strength to\nmingle strong drink,\u201d \u201cthat call evil good, and good evil;\u201d that \u201cjus-\ntify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the\nrighteous from him!\u201d Of such God says:\n\u201cWoe unto them....\nAs the fire devoureth the stubble,\nAnd the flame consumeth the chaff,\nSo their root shall be as rottenness,\nAnd their blossom shall go up as dust:\nBecause they have cast away the law of the Lord of\n234 The Ministry of Healing\nhosts,\nAnd despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.\u201d\nIsaiah 5:22-24.\nThe honor of God, the stability of the nation, the well-being of\nthe community, of the home, and of the individual, demand that\nevery possible effort be made in arousing the people to the evil of\nintemperance. Soon we shall see the result of this terrible evil as\nwe do not see it now. Who will put forth a determined effort to\nstay the work of destruction? As yet the contest has hardly begun.\nLet an army be formed to stop the sale of the drugged liquors that\nare making men mad. Let the danger from the liquor traffic be\nmade plain and a public sentiment be created that shall demand its\nprohibition. Let the drink-maddened men be given an opportunity\nto escape from their thralldom. Let the voice of the nation demand\nof its lawmakers that a stop be put to this infamous traffic.\n\u201cIf thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death,\nAnd those that are ready to be slain;\nIf thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not;\nDoth not He that pondereth the heart consider it?\nAnd He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it?\u201d\nAnd \u201cwhat wilt thou say when He shall punish thee?\u201d\nProverbs 24:11, 12; Jeremiah\n13:21.\nThe Home [347]\n[348]\n\u201cLife is a training school from which parents and children are to be\ngraduated to the higher school in the mansions of God. \u201d\nChapter 28\u2014Ministry of the Home[349]\nThe restoration and uplifting of humanity begins in the home.\nThe work of parents underlies every other. Society is composed\nof families, and is what the heads of families make it. Out of the\nheart are \u201cthe issues of life\u201d (Proverbs 4:23); and the heart of the\ncommunity, of the church, and of the nation is the household. The\nwell-being of society, the success of the church, the prosperity of\nthe nation, depend upon home influences.\nThe importance and the opportunities of the home life are il-\nlustrated in the life of Jesus. He who came from heaven to be our\nexample and teacher spent thirty years as a member of the household\nat Nazareth. Concerning these years the Bible record is very brief.\nNo mighty miracles attracted the attention of the multitude. No eager\nthrongs followed His steps or listened to His words. Yet during all\nthese years He was fulfilling His divine mission. He lived as one of\nus, sharing the home life, submitting to its discipline, performing its\nduties, bearing its burdens. In the sheltering care of a humble home,\nparticipating in the experiences of our common lot, He \u201cincreased\nin wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.\u201d Luke 2:52.\nDuring all these secluded years His life flowed out in currents of[350]\nsympathy and helpfulness. His unselfishness and patient endurance,\nHis courage and faithfulness, His resistance of temptation, His un-\nfailing peace and quiet joyfulness, were a constant inspiration. He\nbrought a pure, sweet atmosphere into the home, and His life was as\nleaven working amidst the elements of society. None said that He\nhad wrought a miracle; yet virtue\u2014the healing, life-giving power\nof love\u2014went out from Him to the tempted, the sick, and the dis-\nheartened. In an unobtrusive way, from His very childhood, He\nministered to others, and because of this, when He began His public\nministry, many heard Him gladly.\nThe Saviour\u2019s early years are more than an example to the youth.[351]\nThey are a lesson, and should be an encouragement, to every parent.\nThe circle of family and neighborhood duties is the very first field of\n236\nMinistry of the Home 237\neffort for those who would work for the uplifting of their fellow men.\nThere is no more important field of effort than that committed to the\nfounders and guardians of the home. No work entrusted to human\nbeings involves greater or more far-reaching results than does the\nwork of fathers and mothers.\nIt is by the youth and children of today that the future of society\nis to be determined, and what these youth and children shall be\ndepends upon the home. To the lack of right home training may be\ntraced the larger share of the disease and misery and crime that curse\nhumanity. If the home life were pure and true, if the children who\nwent forth from its care were prepared to meet life\u2019s responsibilities\nand dangers, what a change would be seen in the world!\nGreat efforts are put forth, time and money and labor almost with-\nout limit are expended, in enterprises and institutions for reforming\nthe victims of evil habits. And even these efforts are inadequate to\nmeet the great necessity. Yet how small is the result! How few are\npermanently reclaimed!\nMultitudes long for a better life, but they lack courage and res-\nolution to break away from the power of habit. They shrink from\nthe effort and struggle and sacrifice demanded, and their lives are\nwrecked and ruined. Thus even men of the brightest minds, men of\nhigh aspirations and noble powers, otherwise fitted by nature and\neducation to fill positions of trust and responsibility, are degraded\nand lost for this life and for the life to come.\nFor those who do reform, how bitter the struggle to regain their\nmanhood! And all their life long, in a shattered constitution, a\nwavering will, impaired intellect, and weakened soul power, many [352]\nreap the harvest of their evil sowing. How much more might be\naccomplished if the evil were dealt with at the beginning!\nThis work rests, in a great degree, with parents. In the efforts\nput forth to stay the progress of intemperance and of other evils that\nare eating like a cancer in the social body, if more attention were\ngiven to teaching parents how to form the habits and character of\ntheir children, a hundredfold more good would result. Habit, which\nis so terrible a force for evil, it is in their power to make a force for\ngood. They have to do with the stream at its source, and it rests with\nthem to direct it rightly.\n238 The Ministry of Healing\nParents may lay for their children the foundation for a healthy,\nhappy life. They may send them forth from their homes with moral\nstamina to resist temptation, and courage and strength to wrestle\nsuccessfully with life\u2019s problems. They may inspire in them the\npurpose and develop the power to make their lives an honor to God\nand a blessing to the world. They may make straight paths for their\nfeet, through sunshine and shadow, to the glorious heights above.\nThe mission of the home extends beyond its own members. The\nChristian home is to be an object lesson, illustrating the excellence\nof the true principles of life. Such an illustration will be a power for\ngood in the world. Far more powerful than any sermon that can be\npreached is the influence of a true home upon human hearts and lives.\nAs the youth go out from such a home, the lessons they have learned\nare imparted. Nobler principles of life are introduced into other\nhouseholds, and an uplifting influence works in the community.\nThere are many others to whom we might make our homes\na blessing. Our social entertainments should not be governed by\nthe dictates of worldly custom, but by the Spirit of Christ and the[353]\nteaching of His word. The Israelites, in all their festivities, included\nthe poor, the stranger, and the Levite, who was both the assistant of\nthe priest in the sanctuary, and a religious teacher and missionary.\nThese were regarded as the guests of the people, to share their\nhospitality on all occasions of social and religious rejoicing, and\nto be tenderly cared for in sickness or in need. It is such as these\nwhom we should make welcome to our homes. How much such a\nwelcome might do to cheer and encourage the missionary nurse or\nthe teacher, the care-burdened, hard-working mother, or the feeble\nand aged, so often without a home, and struggling with poverty and\nmany discouragements.\n\u201cWhen thou makest a dinner or a supper,\u201d Christ says, \u201ccall\nnot thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich\nneighbors; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made\nthee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed,[354]\nthe lame, the blind: and thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot\nrecompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection\nof the just.\u201d Luke 14:12-14.\nThese are guests whom it will lay on you no great burden to\nreceive. You will not need to provide for them elaborate or expensive\nMinistry of the Home 239\nentertainment. You will need to make no effort at display. The\nwarmth of a genial welcome, a place at your fireside, a seat at your\nhome table, the privilege of sharing the blessing of the hour of prayer,\nwould to many of these be like a glimpse of heaven.\nOur sympathies are to overflow the boundaries of self and the\nenclosure of family walls. There are precious opportunities for those\nwho will make their homes a blessing to others. Social influence is\na wonderful power. We can use it if we will as a means of helping\nthose about us.\nOur homes should be a place of refuge for the tempted youth.\nMany there are who stand at the parting of the ways. Every influence,\nevery impression, is determining the choice that shapes their destiny\nboth here and hereafter. Evil invites them. Its resorts are made bright\nand attractive. They have a welcome for every comer. All about\nus are youth who have no home, and many whose homes have no\nhelpful, uplifting power, and the youth drift into evil. They are going\ndown to ruin within the very shadow of our own doors.\nThese youth need a hand stretched out to them in sympathy. Kind\nwords simply spoken, little attentions simply bestowed, will sweep\naway the clouds of temptation which gather over the soul. The true\nexpression of heaven-born sympathy has power to open the door of\nhearts that need the fragrance of Christlike words, and the simple,\ndelicate touch of the spirit of Christ\u2019s love. If we would show an\ninterest in the youth, invite them to our homes, and surround them\nwith cheering, helpful influences, there are many who would gladly [355]\nturn their steps into the upward path.\nLife\u2019s Opportunities\nOur time here is short. We can pass through this world but once;\nas we pass along, let us make the most of life. The work to which we\nare called does not require wealth or social position or great ability.\nIt requires a kindly, self-sacrificing spirit and a steadfast purpose.\nA lamp, however small, if kept steadily burning, may be the means\nof lighting many other lamps. Our sphere of influence may seem\nnarrow, our ability small, our opportunities few, our acquirements\nlimited; yet wonderful possibilities are ours through a faithful use\nof the opportunities of our own homes. If we will open our hearts\n240 The Ministry of Healing\nand homes to the divine principles of life we shall become channels\nfor currents of life-giving power. From our homes will flow streams\nof healing, bringing life and beauty and fruitfulness where now are\nbarrenness and dearth.\nChapter 29\u2014The Builders of the Home [356]\nHe who gave Eve to Adam as a helpmeet, performed His first\nmiracle at a marriage festival. In the festal hall where friends and\nkindred rejoiced together, Christ began His public ministry. Thus He\nsanctioned marriage, recognizing it as an institution that He Himself\nhad established. He ordained that men and women should be united\nin holy wedlock, to rear families whose members, crowned with\nhonor, should be recognized as members of the family above.\nChrist honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol\nof the union between Him and His redeemed ones. He Himself is\nthe Bridegroom; the bride is the church, of which, as His chosen\none, He says, \u201cThou art all fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.\u201d\nSong of Solomon 4:7.\nChrist \u201cloved the church, and gave Himself for it; that He might\nsanctify and cleanse it; ... that it should be holy and without blemish.\u201d\n\u201cSo ought men to love their wives.\u201d Ephesians 5:25-28.\nThe family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of any\non earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And it is a\nblessing wherever the marriage covenant is entered into intelligently, [357]\nin the fear of God, and with due consideration for its responsibilities.\nThose who are contemplating marriage should consider what\nwill be the character and influence of the home they are founding.\nAs they become parents, a sacred trust is committed to them. Upon\nthem depends in a great measure the well-being of their children\nin this world, and their happiness in the world to come. To a great\nextent they determine both the physical and the moral stamp that the\nlittle ones receive. And upon the character of the home depends the\ncondition of society; the weight of each family\u2019s influence will tell\nin the upward or the downward scale.\nThe choice of a life companion should be such as best to secure\nphysical, mental, and spiritual well-being for parents and for their\nchildren\u2014such as will enable both parents and children to bless their [358]\nfellow men and to honor their Creator.\n241\n242 The Ministry of Healing\nBefore assuming the responsibilities involved in marriage, young\nmen and young women should have such an experience in practical\nlife as will prepare them for its duties and its burdens. Early mar-\nriages are not to be encouraged. A relation so important as marriage\nand so far-reaching in its results should not be entered upon hastily,\nwithout sufficient preparation, and before the mental and physical\npowers are well developed.\nThe parties may not have worldly wealth, but they should have\nthe far greater blessing of health. And in most cases there should\nnot be a great disparity in age. A neglect of this rule may result in\nseriously impairing the health of the younger. And often the children\nare robbed of physical and mental strength. They cannot receive\nfrom an aged parent the care and companionship which their young\nlives demand, and they may be deprived by death of the father or the\nmother at the very time when love and guidance are most needed.\nIt is only in Christ that a marriage alliance can be safely formed.\nHuman love should draw its closest bonds from divine love. Only\nwhere Christ reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish affection.\nLove is a precious gift, which we receive from Jesus. Pure\nand holy affection is not a feeling, but a principle. Those who are\nactuated by true love are neither unreasonable nor blind. Taught\nby the Holy Spirit, they love God supremely, and their neighbor as\nthemselves.\nLet those who are contemplating marriage weigh every sentiment[359]\nand watch every development of character in the one with whom\nthey think to unite their life destiny. Let every step toward a marriage\nalliance be characterized by modesty, simplicity, sincerity, and an\nearnest purpose to please and honor God. Marriage affects the\nafterlife both in this world and in the world to come. A sincere\nChristian will make no plans that God cannot approve.\nIf you are blessed with God-fearing parents, seek counsel of\nthem. Open to them your hopes and plans, learn the lessons which\ntheir life experiences have taught, and you will be saved many a\nheartache. Above all, make Christ your counselor. Study His word\nwith prayer.\nUnder such guidance let a young woman accept as a life com-\npanion only one who possesses pure, manly traits of character, one\nwho is diligent, aspiring, and honest, one who loves and fears God.\nBuilders of the Home 243\nLet a young man seek one to stand by his side who is fitted to bear\nher share of life\u2019s burdens, one whose influence will ennoble and\nrefine him, and who will make him happy in her love.\n\u201cA prudent wife is from the Lord.\u201d \u201cThe heart of her husband\ndoth safely trust in her.... She will do him good and not evil all\nthe days of her life.\u201d \u201cShe openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in\nher tongue is the law of kindness. She looketh well to the ways of\nher household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children\narise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her,\u201d\nsaying, \u201cMany daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest\nthem all.\u201d He who gains such a wife \u201cfindeth a good thing, and\nobtaineth favor of the Lord.\u201d Proverbs 19:14; 31:11, 12, 26-29;\n18:22.\nHowever carefully and wisely marriage may have been entered\ninto, few couples are completely united when the marriage ceremony [360]\nis performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is the work of\nthe after years.\nAs life with its burden of perplexity and care meets the newly\nwedded pair, the romance with which imagination so often invests\nmarriage disappears. Husband and wife learn each other\u2019s character\nas it was impossible to learn it in their previous association. This is\na most critical period in their experience. The happiness and useful-\nness of their whole future life depend upon their taking a right course\nnow. Often they discern in each other unsuspected weaknesses and\ndefects; but the hearts that love has united will discern excellencies\nalso heretofore unknown. Let all seek to discover the excellencies\nrather than the defects. Often it is our own attitude, the atmosphere\nthat surrounds ourselves, which determines what will be revealed\nto us in another. There are many who regard the expression of love\nas a weakness, and they maintain a reserve that repels others. This\nspirit checks the current of sympathy. As the social and generous\nimpulses are repressed, they wither, and the heart becomes desolate\nand cold. We should beware of this error. Love cannot long exist\nwithout expression. Let not the heart of one connected with you\nstarve for the want of kindness and sympathy.\nThough difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may arise,\nlet neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that their union\nis a mistake or a disappointment. Determine to be all that it is\n244 The Ministry of Healing\npossible to be to each other. Continue the early attentions. In every\nway encourage each other in fighting the battles of life. Study to\nadvance the happiness of each other. Let there be mutual love,\nmutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead of being the end of love,\nwill be as it were the very beginning of love. The warmth of true\nfriendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a foretaste of the joys\nof heaven.\nAround every family there is a sacred circle that should be kept[361]\nunbroken. Within this circle no other person has a right to come. Let\nnot the husband or the wife permit another to share the confidences\nthat belong solely to themselves.\nLet each give love rather than exact it. Cultivate that which is\nnoblest in yourselves, and be quick to recognize the good qualities\nin each other. The consciousness of being appreciated is a wonderful\nstimulus and satisfaction. Sympathy and respect encourage the\nstriving after excellence, and love itself increases as it stimulates to\nnobler aims.\nNeither the husband nor the wife should merge his or her indi-\nviduality in that of the other. Each has a personal relation to God. Of\nHim each is to ask, \u201cWhat is right?\u201d \u201cWhat is wrong?\u201d \u201cHow may\nI best fulfill life\u2019s purpose?\u201d Let the wealth of your affection flow\nforth to Him who gave His life for you. Make Christ first and last\nand best in everything. As your love for Him becomes deeper and\nstronger, your love for each other will be purified and strengthened.\nThe spirit that Christ manifests toward us is the spirit that hus-\nband and wife are to manifest toward each other. \u201cAs Christ also\nhath loved us,\u201d \u201cwalk in love.\u201d \u201cAs the church is subject unto Christ,\nso let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands,\nlove your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave\nHimself for it.\u201d Ephesians 5:2, 24, 25.\nNeither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exercise over\nthe other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel each other to\nyield to your wishes. You cannot do this and retain each other\u2019s love.\nBe kind, patient, and forbearing, considerate, and courteous. By the\ngrace of God you can succeed in making each other happy, as in\nyour marriage vow you promised to do.\nBuilders of the Home 245\nHappiness in Unselfish Service [362]\nBut remember that happiness will not be found in shutting your-\nselves up to yourselves, satisfied to pour out all your affection upon\neach other. Seize upon every opportunity for contributing to the hap-\npiness of those around you. Remember that true joy can be found\nonly in unselfish service.\nForbearance and unselfishness mark the words and acts of all\nwho live the new life in Christ. As you seek to live His life, striving\nto conquer self and selfishness and to minister to the needs of others,\nyou will gain victory after victory. Thus your influence will bless\nthe world.\nMen and women can reach God\u2019s ideal for them if they will take\nChrist as their helper. What human wisdom cannot do, His grace\nwill accomplish for those who give themselves to Him in loving\ntrust. His providence can unite hearts in bonds that are of heavenly\norigin. Love will not be a mere exchange of soft and flattering words.\nThe loom of heaven weaves with warp and woof finer, yet more firm,\nthan can be woven by the looms of earth. The result is not a tissue\nfabric, but a texture that will bear wear and test and trial. Heart will\nbe bound to heart in the golden bonds of a love that is enduring.\nBetter than gold is a peaceful home,\nWhere all the fireside charities come;\nThe shrine of love and the heaven of life,\nHallowed by mother, or sister, or wife.\nHowever humble the home may be,\nOr tried with sorrows by heaven\u2019s decree,\nThe blessings that never were bought or sold,\nAnd center there, are better than gold.\nAnon.\nChapter 30\u2014Choice and Preparation of the Home[363]\nThe gospel is a wonderful simplifier of life\u2019s problems. Its in-\nstruction, heeded, would make plain many a perplexity and save us\nfrom many an error. It teaches us to estimate things at their true\nvalue and to give the most effort to the things of greatest worth\u2014the\nthings that will endure. This lesson is needed by those upon whom\nrests the responsibility of selecting a home. They should not allow\nthemselves to be diverted from the highest aim. Let them remember\nthat the home on earth is to be a symbol of and a preparation for the\nhome in heaven. Life is a training school, from which parents and\nchildren are to be graduated to the higher school in the mansions of\nGod. As the location for a home is sought, let this purpose direct\nthe choice. Be not controlled by the desire for wealth, the dictates\nof fashion, or the customs of society. Consider what will tend most\nto simplicity, purity, health, and real worth.\nThe world over, cities are becoming hotbeds of vice. On every\nhand are the sights and sounds of evil. Everywhere are enticements\nto sensuality and dissipation. The tide of corruption and crime is\ncontinually swelling. Every day brings the record of violence\u2014\nrobberies, murders, suicides, and crimes unnamable.\nLife in the cities is false and artificial. The intense passion for[364]\nmoney getting, the whirl of excitement and pleasure seeking, the\nthirst for display, the luxury and extravagance, all are forces that,\nwith the great masses of mankind, are turning the mind from life\u2019s\ntrue purpose. They are opening the door to a thousand evils. Upon\nthe youth they have almost irresistible power.\nOne of the most subtle and dangerous temptations that assail the\nchildren and youth in the cities is the love of pleasure. Holidays are\nnumerous; games and horse racing draw thousands, and the whirl of\nexcitement and pleasure attracts them away from the sober duties of\nlife. Money that should have been saved for better uses is frittered\naway for amusements.\n246\nChoice and Preparation of the Home 247\nThrough the working of trusts, and the results of labor unions\nand strikes, the conditions of life in the city are constantly becoming\nmore and more difficult. Serious troubles are before us; and for\nmany families removal from the cities will become a necessity.\nThe physical surroundings in the cities are often a peril to health. [365]\nThe constant liability to contact with disease, the prevalence of\nfoul air, impure water, impure food, the crowded, dark, unhealthful\ndwellings, are some of the many evils to be met.\nIt was not God\u2019s purpose that people should be crowded into\ncities, huddled together in terraces and tenements. In the beginning\nHe placed our first parents amidst the beautiful sights and sounds\nHe desires us to rejoice in today. The more nearly we come into\nharmony with God\u2019s original plan, the more favorable will be our\nposition to secure health of body, and mind, and soul.\nAn expensive dwelling, elaborate furnishings, display, luxury,\nand ease, do not furnish the conditions essential to a happy, useful\nlife. Jesus came to this earth to accomplish the greatest work ever\naccomplished among men. He came as God\u2019s ambassador, to show\nus how to live so as to secure life\u2019s best results. What were the\nconditions chosen by the infinite Father for His Son? A secluded\nhome in the Galilean hills; a household sustained by honest, self-re-\nspecting labor; a life of simplicity; daily conflict with difficulty and\nhardship; self-sacrifice, economy, and patient, gladsome service; the [366]\nhour of study at His mother\u2019s side, with the open scroll of Scripture;\nthe quiet of dawn or twilight in the green valley; the holy ministries\nof nature; the study of creation and providence; and the soul\u2019s com-\nmunion with God\u2014these were the conditions and opportunities of\nthe early life of Jesus.\nSo with the great majority of the best and noblest men of all\nages. Read the history of Abraham, Jacob, and Joseph, of Moses,\nDavid, and Elisha. Study the lives of men of later times who have\nmost worthily filled positions of trust and responsibility, the men\nwhose influence has been most effective for the world\u2019s uplifting.\nHow many of these were reared in country homes. They knew\nlittle of luxury. They did not spend their youth in amusement. Many\nwere forced to struggle with poverty and hardship. They early\nlearned to work, and their active life in the open air gave vigor\nand elasticity to all their faculties. Forced to depend upon their own\n248 The Ministry of Healing\nresources, they learned to combat difficulties and to surmount obsta-\ncles, and they gained courage and perseverance. They learned the\nlessons of self-reliance and self-control. Sheltered in a great degree\nfrom evil associations, they were satisfied with natural pleasures and\nwholesome companionships. They were simple in their tastes and\ntemperate in their habits. They were governed by principle, and they\ngrew up pure and strong and true. When called to their lifework,\nthey brought to it physical and mental power, buoyancy of spirit,\nability to plan and execute, and steadfastness in resisting evil, that\nmade them a positive power for good in the world.\nBetter than any other inheritance of wealth you can give to your\nchildren will be the gift of a healthy body, a sound mind, and a noble\ncharacter. Those who understand what constitutes life\u2019s true success[367]\nwill be wise betimes. They will keep in view life\u2019s best things in\ntheir choice of a home.\nInstead of dwelling where only the works of men can be seen,\nwhere the sights and sounds frequently suggest thoughts of evil,\nwhere turmoil and confusion bring weariness and disquietude, go\nwhere you can look upon the works of God. Find rest of spirit in the\nbeauty and quietude and peace of nature. Let the eye rest on the green\nfields, the groves, and the hills. Look up to the blue sky, unobscured\nby the city\u2019s dust and smoke, and breathe the invigorating air of\nheaven. Go where, apart from the distractions and dissipations of\ncity life, you can give your children your companionship, where you\ncan teach them to learn of God through His works, and train them\nfor lives of integrity and usefulness.\nSimplicity in Furnishing\nOur artificial habits deprive us of many blessings and much\nenjoyment, and unfit us for living the most useful lives. Elaborate\nand expensive furnishings are a waste not only of money, but of that\nwhich is a thousandfold more precious. They bring into the home a\nheavy burden of care and labor and perplexity.\nWhat are the conditions in many homes, even where resources\nare limited and the work of the household rests chiefly on the mother?\nThe best rooms are furnished in a style beyond the means of the\noccupants and unsuited to their convenience and enjoyment. There\nChoice and Preparation of the Home 249\nare expensive carpets, elaborately carved and daintily upholstered\nfurniture, and delicate drapery. Tables, mantels, and every other\navailable space are crowded with ornaments, and the walls are cov-\nered with pictures, until the sight becomes wearying. And what an\namount of work is required to keep all these in order and free from\ndust! This work, and the other artificial habits of the family in its\nconformity to fashion, demand of the housewife unending toil.\nIn many a home the wife and mother has no time to read, to keep [368]\nherself well informed, no time to be a companion to her husband,\nno time to keep in touch with the developing minds of her children.\nThere is no time or place for the precious Saviour to be a close, dear\ncompanion. Little by little she sinks into a mere household drudge, [369]\nher strength and time and interest absorbed in the things that perish\nwith the using. Too late she awakes to find herself almost a stranger\nin her own home. The precious opportunities once hers to influence\nher dear ones for the higher life, unimproved, have passed away\nforever.\nLet the homemakers resolve to live on a wiser plan. Let it be your\nfirst aim to make a pleasant home. Be sure to provide the facilities\nthat will lighten labor and promote health and comfort. Plan for the [370]\nentertainment of the guests whom Christ has bidden us welcome,\nand of whom He says, \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of\nthe least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.\u201d Matthew\n25:40.\nFurnish your home with things plain and simple, things that will\nbear handling, that can be easily kept clean, and that can be replaced\nwithout great expense. By exercising taste, you can make a very\nsimple home attractive and inviting, if love and contentment are\nthere.\nBeautiful Surroundings\nGod loves the beautiful. He has clothed the earth and the heavens\nwith beauty, and with a Father\u2019s joy He watches the delight of His\nchildren in the things that He has made. He desires us to surround\nour homes with the beauty of natural things.\nNearly all dwellers in the country, however poor, could have\nabout their homes a bit of grassy lawn, a few shade trees, flowering\n250 The Ministry of Healing\nshrubbery, or fragrant blossoms. And far more than any artificial\nadorning will they minister to the happiness of the household. They\nwill bring into the home life a softening, refining influence, strength-\nening the love of nature, and drawing the members of the household\nnearer to one another and nearer to God.\nChapter 31\u2014The Mother [371]\nWhat the parents are, that, to a great extent, the children will\nbe. The physical conditions of the parents, their dispositions and\nappetites, their mental and moral tendencies, are, to a greater or less\ndegree, reproduced in their children.\nThe nobler the aims, the higher the mental and spiritual endow-\nments, and the better developed the physical powers of the parents,\nthe better will be the life equipment they give their children. In\ncultivating that which is best in themselves, parents are exerting an\ninfluence to mold society and to uplift future generations.\nFathers and mothers need to understand their responsibility. The\nworld is full of snares for the feet of the young. Multitudes are\nattracted by a life of selfish and sensual pleasure. They cannot\ndiscern the hidden dangers or the fearful ending of the path that\nseems to them the way of happiness. Through the indulgence of\nappetite and passion, their energies are wasted, and millions are\nruined for this world and for the world to come. Parents should\nremember that their children must encounter these temptations. Even\nbefore the birth of the child, the preparation should begin that will\nenable it to fight successfully the battle against evil.\nEspecially does responsibility rest upon the mother. She, by [372]\nwhose lifeblood the child is nourished and its physical frame built\nup, imparts to it also mental and spiritual influences that tend to the\nshaping of mind and character. It was Jochebed, the Hebrew mother,\nwho, strong in faith, was \u201cnot afraid of the king\u2019s commandment\u201d\n(Hebrews 11:23), of whom was born Moses, the deliverer of Israel.\nIt was Hannah, the woman of prayer and self-sacrifice and heavenly\ninspiration, who gave birth to Samuel, the heaven-instructed child,\nthe incorruptible judge, the founder of Israel\u2019s sacred schools. It was\nElizabeth the kinswoman and kindred spirit of Mary of Nazareth,\nwho was the mother of the Saviour\u2019s herald.\n251\n252 The Ministry of Healing\nTemperance and Self-Control\nThe carefulness with which the mother should guard her habits\nof life is taught in the Scriptures. When the Lord would raise up\nSamson as a deliverer for Israel, \u201cthe angel of Jehovah\u201d appeared to\nthe mother, with special instruction concerning her habits, and also\nfor the treatment of her child. \u201cBeware,\u201d he said, \u201cand now drink no\nwine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:13,\n7.\nThe effect of prenatal influences is by many parents looked upon\nas a matter of little moment; but heaven does not so regard it. The\nmessage sent by an angel of God, and twice given in the most solemn\nmanner, shows it to be deserving of our most careful thought.\nIn the words spoken to the Hebrew mother, God speaks to all\nmothers in every age. \u201cLet her beware,\u201d the angel said; \u201call that I\ncommanded her let her observe.\u201d The well-being of the child will\nbe affected by the habits of the mother. Her appetites and passions\nare to be controlled by principle. There is something for her to\nshun, something for her to work against, if she fulfills God\u2019s purpose\nfor her in giving her a child. If before the birth of her child she is\nself-indulgent, if she is selfish, impatient, and exacting, these traits\nwill be reflected in the disposition of the child. Thus many children[373]\nhave received as a birthright almost unconquerable tendencies to\nevil.\nBut if the mother unswervingly adheres to right principles, if she\nis temperate and self-denying, if she is kind, gentle, and unselfish,\nshe may give her child these same precious traits of character. Very\nexplicit was the command prohibiting the use of wine by the mother.\nEvery drop of strong drink taken by her to gratify appetite endangers\nthe physical, mental, and moral health of her child, and is a direct\nsin against her Creator.\nMany advisers urge that every wish of the mother should be\ngratified; that if she desires any article of food, however harmful,\nshe should freely indulge her appetite. Such advice is false and\nmischievous. The mother\u2019s physical needs should in no case be\nneglected. Two lives are depending upon her, and her wishes should\nbe tenderly regarded, her needs generously supplied. But at this time\nabove all others she should avoid, in diet and in every other line,\nMother 253\nwhatever would lessen physical or mental strength. By the command\nof God Himself she is placed under the most solemn obligation to\nexercise self-control.\nOverwork\nThe strength of the mother should be tenderly cherished. In-\nstead of spending her precious strength in exhausting labor, her care\nand burdens should be lessened. Often the husband and father is\nunacquainted with the physical laws which the well-being of his\nfamily requires him to understand. Absorbed in the struggle for a\nlivelihood, or bent on acquiring wealth and pressed with cares and\nperplexities, he allows to rest upon the wife and mother burdens that\novertax her strength at the most critical period and cause feebleness\nand disease.\nMany a husband and father might learn a helpful lesson from the [374]\ncarefulness of the faithful shepherd. Jacob, when urged to undertake\na rapid and difficult journey, made answer:\n\u201cThe children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young\nare with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock\nwill die.... I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth\nbefore me and the children be able to endure.\u201d Genesis 33:13, 14.\nIn life\u2019s toilsome way let the husband and father \u201clead on softly,\u201d\nas the companion of his journey is able to endure. Amidst the world\u2019s\neager rush for wealth and power, let him learn to stay his steps, to\ncomfort and support the one who is called to walk by his side.\nCheerfulness\nThe mother should cultivate a cheerful, contented, happy dis-\nposition. Every effort in this direction will be abundantly repaid in\nboth the physical well-being and the moral character of her children.\nA cheerful spirit will promote the happiness of her family and in a\nvery great degree improve her own health.\nLet the husband aid his wife by his sympathy and unfailing af-\nfection. If he wishes to keep her fresh and gladsome, so that she will\nbe as sunshine in the home, let him help her bear her burdens. His\nkindness and loving courtesy will be to her a precious encourage-\n254 The Ministry of Healing\nment, and the happiness he imparts will bring joy and peace to his\nown heart.\nThe husband and father who is morose, selfish, and overbearing,\nis not only unhappy himself, but he casts gloom upon all the inmates\nof his home. He will reap the result in seeing his wife dispirited and[375]\nsickly, and his children marred with his own unlovely temper.\nIf the mother is deprived of the care and comforts she should\nhave, if she is allowed to exhaust her strength through overwork\nor through anxiety and gloom, her children will be robbed of the\nvital force and of the mental elasticity and cheerful buoyancy they\nshould inherit. Far better will it be to make the mother\u2019s life bright\nand cheerful, to shield her from want, wearing labor, and depressing\ncare, and let the children inherit good constitutions, so that they may\nbattle their way through life with their own energetic strength.\nGreat is the honor and the responsibility placed upon fathers\nand mothers, in that they are to stand in the place of God to their\nchildren. Their character, their daily life, their methods of training,\nwill interpret His words to the little ones. Their influence will win\nor repel the child\u2019s confidence in the Lord\u2019s assurances.\nThe Privilege of Parents in Child Training\nHappy are the parents whose lives are a true reflection of the\ndivine, so that the promises and commands of God awaken in the\nchild gratitude and reverence; the parents whose tenderness and\njustice and long-suffering interpret to the child the love and justice\nand long-suffering of God; and who, by teaching the child to love[376]\nand trust and obey them, are teaching him to love and trust and obey\nhis Father in heaven. Parents who impart to a child such a gift have\nendowed him with a treasure more precious than the wealth of all\nthe ages\u2014a treasure as enduring as eternity.\nIn the children committed to her care, every mother has a sacred\ncharge from God. \u201cTake this son, this daughter,\u201d He says; \u201ctrain it\nfor Me; give it a character polished after the similitude of a palace,\nthat it may shine in the courts of the Lord forever.\u201d\nThe mother\u2019s work often seems to her an unimportant service.\nIt is a work that is rarely appreciated. Others know little of her\nmany cares and burdens. Her days are occupied with a round of\nMother 255\nlittle duties, all calling for patient effort, for self-control, for tact, [377]\nwisdom, and self-sacrificing love; yet she cannot boast of what she\nhas done as any great achievement. She has only kept things in\nthe home running smoothly; often weary and perplexed, she has\ntried to speak kindly to the children, to keep them busy and happy,\nand to guide the little feet in the right path. She feels that she has\naccomplished nothing. But it is not so. Heavenly angels watch the\ncare-worn mother, noting the burdens she carries day by day. Her\nname may not have been heard in the world, but it is written in the\nLamb\u2019s book of life.\nThe Mother\u2019s Opportunity\nThere is a God above, and the light and glory from His throne\nrests upon the faithful mother as she tries to educate her children [378]\nto resist the influence of evil. No other work can equal hers in\nimportance. She has not, like the artist, to paint a form of beauty\nupon canvas, nor, like the sculptor, to chisel it from marble. She has\nnot, like the author, to embody a noble thought in words of power,\nnor, like the musician, to express a beautiful sentiment in melody. It\nis hers, with the help of God, to develop in a human soul the likeness\nof the divine.\nThe mother who appreciates this will regard her opportunities as\npriceless. Earnestly will she seek, in her own character and by her\nmethods of training, to present before her children the highest ideal.\nEarnestly, patiently, courageously, she will endeavor to improve\nher own abilities, that she may use aright the highest powers of\nthe mind in the training of her children. Earnestly will she inquire\nat every step, \u201cWhat hath God spoken?\u201d Diligently she will study\nHis word. She will keep her eyes fixed upon Christ, that her own\ndaily experience, in the lowly round of care and duty, may be a true\nreflection of the one true Life.\nChapter 32\u2014The Child[379]\nNot only the habits of the mother, but the training of the child\nwere included in the angel\u2019s instruction to the Hebrew parents. It\nwas not enough that Samson, the child who was to deliver Israel,\nshould have a good legacy at his birth. This was to be followed by\ncareful training. From infancy he was to be trained to habits of strict\ntemperance.\nSimilar instruction was given in regard to John the Baptist. Be-\nfore the birth of the child, the message sent from heaven to the father\nwas:\n\u201cThou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his\nbirth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall\ndrink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy\nSpirit.\u201d Luke 1:14, 15, A.R.V .\nOn heaven\u2019s record of noble men the Saviour declared that there\nstood not one greater than John the Baptist. The work committed to\nhim was one demanding not only physical energy and endurance,\nbut the highest qualities of mind and soul. So important was right\nphysical training as a preparation for this work that the highest angel\nin heaven was sent with a message of instruction to the parents of\nthe child.\nThe directions given concerning the Hebrew children teach us[380]\nthat nothing which affects the child\u2019s physical well-being is to be\nneglected. Nothing is unimportant. Every influence that affects the\nhealth of the body has its bearing upon mind and character.\nToo much importance cannot be placed upon the early training\nof children. The lessons learned, the habits formed, during the years\nof infancy and childhood, have more to do with the formation of the\ncharacter and the direction of the life than have all the instruction\nand training of after years.\nParents need to consider this. They should understand the prin-\nciples that underlie the care and training of children. They should be\ncapable of rearing them in physical, mental, and moral health. Par-\n256\nChild 257\nents should study the laws of nature. They should become acquainted\nwith the organism of the human body. They need to understand the\nfunctions of the various organs, and their relation and dependence.\nThey should study the relation of the mental to the physical powers,\nand the conditions required for the healthy action of each. To assume\nthe responsibilities of parenthood without such preparation is a sin.\nFar too little thought is given to the causes underlying the mor-\ntality, the disease and degeneracy, that exist today even in the most\ncivilized and favored lands. The human race is deteriorating. More\nthan one third die in infancy; [The statement concerning infant\nmortality was correct at the time it was written in 1905. However,\nmodern medicine and proper child care have greatly reduced the\nmortality rate in infancy and childhood.\u2014Publishers.] of those who\nreach manhood and womanhood, by far the greater number suffer\nfrom disease in some form, and but few reach the limit of human\nlife.\nMost of the evils that are bringing misery and ruin to the race\nmight be prevented, and the power to deal with them rests to a great\ndegree with parents. It is not a \u201cmysterious providence\u201d that removes\nthe little children. God does not desire their death. He gives them to\nthe parents to be trained for usefulness here, and for heaven hereafter. [381]\nDid fathers and mothers do what they might to give their children a\ngood inheritance, and then by right management endeavor to remedy\nany wrong conditions of their birth, what a change for the better the\nworld might see!\nThe Care of Infants\nThe more quiet and simple the life of the child, the more favor-\nable it will be to both physical and mental development. At all times\nthe mother should endeavor to be quiet, calm, and self-possessed.\nMany infants are extremely susceptible to nervous excitement, and\nthe mother\u2019s gentle, unhurried manner will have a soothing influence\nthat will be of untold benefit to the child.\nBabies require warmth, but a serious error is often committed\nin keeping them in overheated rooms, deprived to a great degree of\nfresh air. The practice of covering the infant\u2019s face while sleeping is\nharmful, since it prevents free respiration.\n258 The Ministry of Healing\nThe baby should be kept free from every influence that would\ntend to weaken or to poison the system. The most scrupulous care\nshould be taken to have everything about it sweet and clean. While\nit may be necessary to protect the little ones from sudden or too\ngreat changes of temperature, care should be taken, that, sleeping or\nwaking, day or night, they breathe a pure, invigorating atmosphere.\nIn the preparation of the baby\u2019s wardrobe, convenience, comfort,\nand health should be sought before fashion or a desire to excite\nadmiration. The mother should not spend time in embroidery and\nfancywork to make the little garments beautiful, thus taxing herself\nwith unnecessary labor at the expense of her own health and the\nhealth of her child. She should not bend over sewing that severely\ntaxes eyes and nerves, at a time when she needs much rest and\npleasant exercise. She should realize her obligation to cherish her\nstrength, that she may be able to meet the demands that will be made[382]\nupon her.\nIf the dress of the child combines warmth, protection, and com-\nfort, one of the chief causes of irritation and restlessness will be\nremoved. The little one will have better health, and the mother will\nnot find the care of the child so heavy a tax upon her strength and\ntime.\nTight bands or waists hinder the action of the heart and lungs, and\nshould be avoided. No part of the body should at any time be made\nuncomfortable by clothing that compresses any organ or restricts its\nfreedom of movement. The clothing of all children should be loose\nenough to admit of the freest and fullest respiration, and so arranged\nthat the shoulders will support its weight.\nIn some countries the custom of leaving bare the shoulders and\nlimbs of little children still prevails. This custom cannot be too\nseverely condemned. The limbs being remote from the center of\ncirculation, demand greater protection than the other parts of the\nbody. The arteries that convey the blood to the extremities are large,\nproviding for a sufficient quantity of blood to afford warmth and nu-\ntrition. But when the limbs are left unprotected or are insufficiently\nclad, the arteries and veins become contracted, the sensitive portions\nof the body are chilled, and the circulation of the blood hindered.\nIn growing children all the forces of nature need every advan-\ntage to enable them to perfect the physical frame. If the limbs are\nChild 259\ninsufficiently protected, children, and especially girls, cannot be out\nof doors unless the weather is mild. So they are kept in for fear of\nthe cold. If children are well clothed, it will benefit them to exercise\nfreely in the open air, summer or winter.\nMothers who desire their boys and girls to possess the vigor\nof health should dress them properly and encourage them in all [383]\nreasonable weather to be much in the open air. It may require effort\nto break away from the chains of custom, and dress and educate the\nchildren with reference to health; but the result will amply repay the\neffort.\nThe Child\u2019s Diet\nThe best food for the infant is the food that nature provides. Of\nthis it should not be needlessly deprived. It is a heartless thing for a\nmother, for the sake of convenience or social enjoyment, to seek to\nfree herself from the tender office of nursing her little one.\nThe mother who permits her child to be nourished by another\nshould consider well what the result may be. To a greater or less\ndegree the nurse imparts her own temper and temperament to the\nnursing child.\nThe importance of training children to right dietetic habits can\nhardly be overestimated. The little ones need to learn that they eat\nto live, not live to eat. The training should begin with the infant in\nits mother\u2019s arms. The child should be given food only at regular\nintervals, and less frequently as it grows older. It should not be given\nsweets, or the food of older persons, which it is unable to digest.\nCare and regularity in the feeding of infants will not only promote\nhealth, and thus tend to make them quiet and sweet-tempered, but\nwill lay the foundation of habits that will be a blessing to them in\nafter years.\nAs children emerge from babyhood, great care should still be [384]\ntaken in educating their tastes and appetite. Often they are permitted\nto eat what they choose and when they choose, without reference to\nhealth. The pains and money so often lavished upon unwholesome\ndainties lead the young to think that the highest object in life, and\nthat which yields the greatest amount of happiness, is to be able\nto indulge the appetite. The result of this training is gluttony, then\n260 The Ministry of Healing\ncomes sickness, which is usually followed by dosing with poisonous\ndrugs.\nParents should train the appetites of their children and should not\npermit the use of unwholesome foods. But in the effort to regulate\nthe diet, we should be careful not to err in requiring children to eat\nthat which is distasteful, or to eat more than is needed. Children\nhave rights, they have preferences, and when these preferences are\nreasonable they should be respected.\nRegularity in eating should be carefully observed. Nothing\nshould be eaten between meals, no confectionery, nuts, fruits, or\nfood of any kind. Irregularities in eating destroy the healthful tone of\nthe digestive organs, to the detriment of health and cheerfulness. And\nwhen the children come to the table, they do not relish wholesome\nfood; their appetites crave that which is hurtful for them.\nMothers who gratify the desires of their children at the expense\nof health and happy tempers, are sowing seeds of evil that will spring\nup and bear fruit. Self-indulgence grows with the growth of the little\nones, and both mental and physical vigor are sacrificed. Mothers\nwho do this work reap with bitterness the seed they have sown. They\nsee their children grow up unfitted in mind and character to act a\nnoble and useful part in society or in the home. The spiritual as\nwell as the mental and physical powers suffer under the influence\nof unhealthful food. The conscience becomes stupefied, and the[385]\nsusceptibility to good impressions is impaired.\nWhile the children should be taught to control the appetite and\nto eat with reference to health; let it be made plain that they are\ndenying themselves only that which would do them harm. They give\nup hurtful things for something better. Let the table be made inviting\nand attractive, as it is supplied with the good things which God has\nso bountifully bestowed. Let mealtime be a cheerful, happy time.\nAs we enjoy the gifts of God, let us respond by grateful praise to the\nGiver.\nThe Care of Children in Sickness\nIn many cases the sickness of children can be traced to errors\nin management. Irregularities in eating, insufficient clothing in the\nchilly evening, lack of vigorous exercise to keep the blood in healthy\nChild 261\ncirculation, or lack of abundance of air for its purification, may be\nthe cause of the trouble. Let the parents study to find the causes\nof the sickness, and then remedy the wrong conditions as soon as\npossible.\nAll parents have it in their power to learn much concerning the\ncare and prevention, and even the treatment, of disease. Especially\nought the mother to know what to do in common cases of illness in\nher family. She should know how to minister to her sick child. Her\nlove and insight should fit her to perform services for it which could\nnot so well be trusted to a stranger\u2019s hand.\nThe Study of Physiology\nParents should early seek to interest their children in the study\nof physiology and should teach them its simpler principles. Teach\nthem how best to preserve the physical, mental, and spiritual powers,\nand how to use their gifts so that their lives may bring blessing to\none another and honor to God. This knowledge is invaluable to the\nyoung. An education in the things that concern life and health is\nmore important to them than a knowledge of many of the sciences [386]\ntaught in the schools.\nParents should live more for their children, and less for society.\nStudy health subjects, and put your knowledge to a practical use.\nTeach your children to reason from cause to effect. Teach them\nthat if they desire health and happiness, they must obey the laws\nof nature. Though you may not see so rapid improvement as you\ndesire, be not discouraged, but patiently and perseveringly continue\nyour work.\nTeach your children from the cradle to practice self-denial and\nself-control. Teach them to enjoy the beauties of nature and in useful\nemployments to exercise systematically all the powers of body and\nmind. Bring them up to have sound constitutions and good morals,\nto have sunny dispositions and sweet tempers. Impress upon their\ntender minds the truth that God does not design that we should live\nfor present gratification merely, but for our ultimate good. Teach\nthem that to yield to temptation is weak and wicked; to resist, noble\nand manly. These lessons will be as seed sown in good soil, and\nthey will bear fruit that will make your hearts glad.\n262 The Ministry of Healing\nAbove all things else, let parents surround their children with an\natmosphere of cheerfulness, courtesy, and love. A home where love[387]\ndwells, and where it is expressed in looks, in words, and in acts, is a\nplace where angels delight to manifest their presence.\nParents, let the sunshine of love, cheerfulness, and happy con-\ntentment enter your own hearts, and let its sweet, cheering influence\npervade your home. Manifest a kindly, forbearing spirit; and en-\ncourage the same in your children, cultivating all the graces that will\nbrighten the home life. The atmosphere thus created will be to the\nchildren what air and sunshine are to the vegetable world, promoting\nhealth and vigor of mind and body.\nChapter 33\u2014Home Influences [388]\nThe home should be to the children the most attractive place in\nthe world, and the mother\u2019s presence should be its greatest attraction.\nChildren have sensitive, loving natures. They are easily pleased and\neasily made unhappy. By gentle discipline, in loving words and acts,\nmothers may bind their children to their hearts.\nYoung children love companionship and can seldom enjoy them-\nselves alone. They yearn for sympathy and tenderness. That which\nthey enjoy they think will please mother also, and it is natural for\nthem to go to her with their little joys and sorrows. The mother\nshould not wound their sensitive hearts by treating with indifference\nmatters that, though trifling to her, are of great importance to them.\nHer sympathy and approval are precious. An approving glance, a\nword of encouragement or commendation, will be like sunshine in\ntheir hearts, often making the whole day happy.\nInstead of sending her children from her, that she may not be\nannoyed by their noise or troubled by their little wants, let the mother\nplan amusement or light work to employ the active hands and minds.\nBy entering into their feelings and directing their amusements [389]\nand employments, the mother will gain the confidence of her chil-\ndren, and she can the more effectually correct wrong habits, or\ncheck the manifestations of selfishness or passion. A word of cau-\ntion or reproof spoken at the right time will be of great value. By\npatient, watchful love, she can turn the minds of the children in the\nright direction, cultivating in them beautiful and attractive traits of\ncharacter.\nMothers should guard against training their children to be de-\npendent and self-absorbed. Never lead them to think that they are\nthe center, and that everything must revolve around them. Some\nparents give much time and attention to amusing their children, but\nchildren should be trained to amuse themselves, to exercise their\nown ingenuity and skill. Thus they will learn to be content with\nvery simple pleasures. They should be taught to bear bravely their\n263\n264 The Ministry of Healing\nlittle disappointments and trials. Instead of calling attention to every\ntrifling pain or hurt, divert their minds, teach them to pass lightly\nover little annoyances or discomforts. Study to suggest ways by\nwhich the children may learn to be thoughtful for others.\nBut let not the children be neglected. Burdened with many\ncares, mothers sometimes feel that they cannot take time patiently to\ninstruct their little ones and give them love and sympathy. But they\nshould remember that if the children do not find in their parents and\nin their home that which will satisfy their desire for sympathy and\ncompanionship, they will look to other sources, where both mind\nand character may be endangered.\nFor lack of time and thought, many a mother refuses her chil-\ndren some innocent pleasure, while busy fingers and weary eyes are\ndiligently engaged on work designed only for adornment, something\nthat, at best, will serve only to encourage vanity and extravagance in[390]\ntheir young hearts. As the children approach manhood and woman-\nhood, these lessons bear fruit in pride and moral worthlessness. The\nmother grieves over her children\u2019s faults, but does not realize that\nthe harvest she is reaping is from seed which she herself planted.\nSome mothers are not uniform in the treatment of their children.\nAt times they indulge them to their injury, and again they refuse\nsome innocent gratification that would make the childish heart very\nhappy. In this they do not imitate Christ; He loved the children; He\ncomprehended their feelings and sympathized with them in their\npleasures and their trials.\nThe Father\u2019s Responsibility\nThe husband and father is the head of the household. The wife\nlooks to him for love and sympathy, and for aid in the training of the\nchildren; and this is right. The children are his as well as hers, and\nhe is equally interested in their welfare. The children look to their\nfather for support and guidance; he needs to have a right conception\nof life and of the influences and associations that should surround\nhis family; above all, he should be controlled by the love and fear of\nGod and by the teaching of His word, that he may guide the feet of\nhis children in the right way.\nHome Influences 265\nThe father is the lawmaker of the household; and, like Abraham,\nhe should make the law of God the rule of his home. God said of\nAbraham, \u201cI know him, that he will command his children and his [391]\nhousehold.\u201d Genesis 18:19. There would be no sinful neglect to\nrestrain evil, no weak, unwise, indulgent favoritism; no yielding of\nhis conviction of duty to the claims of mistaken affection. Abraham\nwould not only give right instruction, but he would maintain the\nauthority of just and righteous laws. God has given rules for our\nguidance. Children should not be left to wander away from the safe\npath marked out in God\u2019s word, into ways leading to danger, which\nare open on every side. Kindly, but firmly, with persevering, prayer-\nful effort, their wrong desires should be restrained, their inclinations\ndenied.\nThe father should enforce in his family the sterner virtues\u2014\nenergy, integrity, honesty, patience, courage, diligence, and practical\nusefulness. And what he requires of his children he himself should\npractice, illustrating these virtues in his own manly bearing.\nBut, fathers, do not discourage your children. Combine affection\nwith authority, kindness and sympathy with firm restraint. Give\nsome of your leisure hours to your children; become acquainted with\nthem; associate with them in their work and in their sports, and win\ntheir confidence. Cultivate friendship with them, especially with [392]\nyour sons. In this way you will be a strong influence for good.\nThe father should do his part toward making home happy. What-\never his cares and business perplexities, they should not be permitted\nto overshadow his family; he should enter his home with smiles and\npleasant words.\nIn a sense the father is the priest of the household, laying upon\nthe family altar the morning and evening sacrifice. But the wife and\nchildren should unite in prayer and join in the song of praise. In\nthe morning before he leaves home for his daily labor, let the father\ngather his children about him and, bowing before God, commit them\nto the care of the Father in heaven. When the cares of the day are\npast, let the family unite in offering grateful prayer and raising the\nsong of praise, in acknowledgment of divine care during the day. [393]\nFathers and mothers, however pressing your business, do not fail\nto gather your family around God\u2019s altar. Ask for the guardianship\nof holy angels in your home. Remember that your dear ones are\n266 The Ministry of Healing\nexposed to temptations. Daily annoyances beset the path of young\nand old. Those who would live patient, loving, cheerful lives must\npray. Only by receiving constant help from God can we gain the\nvictory over self.\nHome should be a place where cheerfulness, courtesy, and love\nabide; and where these graces dwell, there will abide happiness and\npeace. Troubles may invade, but these are the lot of humanity. Let\npatience, gratitude, and love keep sunshine in the heart, though the\nday may be ever so cloudy. In such homes angels of God abide.\nLet the husband and wife study each other\u2019s happiness, never\nfailing in the small courtesies and little kindly acts that cheer and\nbrighten the life. Perfect confidence should exist between husband\nand wife. Together they should consider their responsibilities. To-\ngether they should work for the highest good of their children. Never\nshould they in the presence of the children criticize each other\u2019s[394]\nplans or question each other\u2019s judgment. Let the wife be careful not\nto make the husband\u2019s work for the children more difficult. Let the\nhusband hold up the hands of his wife, giving her wise counsel and\nloving encouragement.\nNo barrier of coldness and reserve should be allowed to arise\nbetween parents and children. Let parents become acquainted with\ntheir children, seeking to understand their tastes and dispositions,\nentering into their feelings, and drawing out what is in their hearts.\nParents, let your children see that you love them and will do all\nin your power to make them happy. If you do so, your necessary\nrestrictions will have far greater weight in their young minds. Rule\nyour children with tenderness and compassion, remembering that\n\u201ctheir angels do always behold the face of My Father which is in\nheaven.\u201d Matthew 18:10. If you desire the angels to do for your\nchildren the work given them of God, co-operate with them by doing\nyour part.\nBrought up under the wise and loving guidance of a true home,\nchildren will have no desire to wander away in search of pleasure and\ncompanionship. Evil will not attract them. The spirit that prevails\nin the home will mold their characters; they will form habits and\nprinciples that will be a strong defense against temptation when they\nshall leave the home shelter and take their place in the world.\nHome Influences 267\nChildren as well as parents have important duties in the home.\nThey should be taught that they are a part of the home firm. They\nare fed and clothed and loved and cared for, and they should respond\nto these many mercies by bearing their share of the home burdens\nand bringing all the happiness possible into the family of which they\nare members.\nChildren are sometimes tempted to chafe under restraint; but\nin afterlife they will bless their parents for the faithful care and\nstrict watchfulness that guarded and guided them in their years of\ninexperience.\nChapter 34\u2014True Education, a Missionary[395]\nTraining\nTrue education is missionary training. Every son and daughter\nof God is called to be a missionary; we are called to the service of\nGod and our fellow men; and to fit us for this service should be the\nobject of our education.\nTraining for Service\nThis object should ever be kept in view by Christian parents\nand teachers. We know not in what line our children may serve.\nThey may spend their lives within the circle of the home; they may\nengage in life\u2019s common vocations, or go as teachers of the gospel\nto heathen lands; but all are alike called to be missionaries for God,\nministers of mercy to the world.\nThe children and youth, with their fresh talent, energy, and\ncourage, their quick susceptibilities, are loved of God, and He de-\nsires to bring them into harmony with divine agencies. They are to\nobtain an education that will help them to stand by the side of Christ\nin unselfish service.\nOf all His children to the close of time, no less than of the\nfirst disciples, Christ said, \u201cAs Thou hast sent Me into the world,[396]\neven so have I also sent them into the world\u201d (John 17:18), to be\nrepresentatives of God, to reveal His Spirit, to manifest His character,\nto do His work.\nOur children stand, as it were, at the parting of the ways. On\nevery hand the world\u2019s enticements to self-seeking and self-indul-\ngence call them away from the path cast up for the ransomed of the\nLord. Whether their lives shall be a blessing or a curse depends\nupon the choice they make. Overflowing with energy, eager to\ntest their untried capabilities, they must find some outlet for their\nsuperabounding life. Active they will be for good or for evil.\n268\nTrue Education, a Missionary Training 269\nGod\u2019s word does not repress activity, but guides it aright. God\ndoes not bid the youth to be less aspiring. The elements of character\nthat make a man truly successful and honored among men\u2014the\nirrepressible desire for some greater good, the indomitable will,\nthe strenuous application, the untiring perseverance\u2014are not to be\ndiscouraged. By the grace of God they are to be directed to the\nattainment of objects as much higher than mere selfish and worldly\ninterests as the heavens are higher than the earth.\nWith us as parents and as Christians it rests to give our children\nright direction. They are to be carefully, wisely, tenderly guided into\npaths of Christlike ministry. We are under sacred covenant with God\nto rear our children for His service. To surround them with such\ninfluences as shall lead them to choose a life of service, and to give\nthem the training needed, is our first duty.\n\u201cGod so loved, ... that He gave,\u201d \u201cgave His only-begotten Son,\u201d\nthat we should not perish, but have everlasting life. \u201cChrist ... hath\nloved us, and hath given Himself for us.\u201d If we love we shall give.\n\u201cNot to be ministered unto, but to minister\u201d is the great lesson which\nwe are to learn and to teach. John 3:16; Ephesians 5:2; Matthew\n20:28.\nLet the youth be impressed with the thought that they are not\ntheir own. They belong to Christ. They are the purchase of His [397]\nblood, the claim of His love. They live because He keeps them by\nHis power. Their time, their strength, their capabilities are His, to\nbe developed, to be trained, to be used for Him.\nNext to the angelic beings, the human family, formed in the\nimage of God, are the noblest of His created works. God desires\nthem to become all that He has made it possible for them to be, and\nto do their very best with the powers He has given them.\nLife is mysterious and sacred. It is the manifestation of God\nHimself, the source of all life. Precious are its opportunities, and\nearnestly should they be improved. Once lost, they are gone forever.\nBefore us God places eternity, with its solemn realities, and gives\nus a grasp on immortal, imperishable themes. He presents valuable,\nennobling truth, that we may advance in a safe and sure path, in\npursuit of an object worthy of the earnest engagement of all our\ncapabilities.\n270 The Ministry of Healing\nGod looks into the tiny seed that He Himself has formed, and\nsees wrapped within it the beautiful flower, the shrub, or the lofty,\nwide-spreading tree. So does He see the possibilities in every human\nbeing. We are here for a purpose. God has given us His plan for our\nlife, and He desires us to reach the highest standard of development.\nHe desires that we shall constantly be growing in holiness, in[398]\nhappiness, in usefulness. All have capabilities which they must be\ntaught to regard as sacred endowments, to appreciate as the Lord\u2019s\ngifts, and rightly to employ. He desires the youth to cultivate every\npower of their being, and to bring every faculty into active exercise.\nHe desires them to enjoy all that is useful and precious in this life, to\nbe good and to do good, laying up a heavenly treasure for the future\nlife.\nIt should be their ambition to excel in all things that are unselfish,\nhigh, and noble. Let them look to Christ as the pattern after which\nthey are to be fashioned. The holy ambition that He revealed in His\nlife they are to cherish\u2014an ambition to make the world better for\ntheir having lived in it. This is the work to which they are called.\nA Broad Foundation\nThe highest of all sciences is the science of soul saving. The\ngreatest work to which human beings can aspire is the work of\nwinning men from sin to holiness. For the accomplishment of this\nwork, a broad foundation must be laid. A comprehensive education\nis needed\u2014an education that will demand from parents and teachers\nsuch thought and effort as mere instruction in the sciences does\nnot require. Something more is called for than the culture of the\nintellect. Education is not complete unless the body, the mind, and\nthe heart are equally educated. The character must receive proper\ndiscipline for its fullest and highest development. All the faculties\nof mind and body are to be developed and rightly trained. It is a duty\nto cultivate and to exercise every power that will render us more\nefficient workers for God.\nTrue education includes the whole being. It teaches the right\nuse of one\u2019s self. It enables us to make the best use of brain, bone,[399]\nand muscle, of body, mind, and heart. The faculties of the mind, as\nthe higher powers, are to rule the kingdom of the body. The natural\nTrue Education, a Missionary Training 271\nappetites and passions are to be brought under the control of the\nconscience and the spiritual affections. Christ stands at the head of\nhumanity, and it is His purpose to lead us, in His service, into high\nand holy paths of purity. By the wondrous working of His grace, we\nare to be made complete in Him.\nJesus secured His education in the home. His mother was His\nfirst human teacher. From her lips, and from the scrolls of the\nprophets, He learned of heavenly things. He lived in a peasant\u2019s\nhome and faithfully and cheerfully acted His part in bearing the\nhousehold burdens. He who had been the commander of heaven\nwas a willing servant, a loving, obedient son. He learned a trade\nand with His own hands worked in the carpenter\u2019s shop with Joseph.\nIn the garb of a common laborer He walked the streets of the little [400]\ntown, going to and returning from His humble work.\nWith the people of that age the value of things was estimated by\noutward show. As religion had declined in power, it had increased\nin pomp. The educators of the time sought to command respect\nby display and ostentation. To all this the life of Jesus presented a\nmarked contrast. His life demonstrated the worthlessness of those\nthings that men regarded as life\u2019s great essentials. The schools of\nHis time, with their magnifying of things small and their belittling\nof things great, He did not seek. His education was gained from\nHeaven- appointed sources, from useful work, from the study of the\nScriptures, from nature, and from the experiences of life\u2014God\u2019s\nlesson books, full of instruction to all who bring to them the willing\nhand, the seeing eye, and the understanding heart.\n\u201cThe Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom:\nand the grace of God was upon Him.\u201d Luke 2:40.\nThus prepared, He went forth to His mission, in every moment\nof His contact with men exerting upon them an influence to bless, a\npower to transform, such as the world had never witnessed.\nThe home is the child\u2019s first school, and it is here that the founda-\ntion should be laid for a life of service. Its principles are to be taught\nnot merely in theory. They are to shape the whole life training.\nVery early the lesson of helpfulness should be taught the child. [401]\nAs soon as strength and reasoning power are sufficiently developed,\nhe should be given duties to perform in the home. He should be\nencouraged in trying to help father and mother, encouraged to deny\n272 The Ministry of Healing\nand to control himself, to put other\u2019s happiness and convenience\nbefore his own, to watch for opportunities to cheer and assist brothers\nand sisters and playmates, and to show kindness to the aged, the\nsick, and the unfortunate. The more fully the spirit of true ministry\npervades the home, the more fully it will be developed in the lives\nof the children. They will learn to find joy in service and sacrifice\nfor the good of others.\nThe Work of the School\nThe home training should be supplemented by the work of the\nschool. The development of the whole being, physical, mental, and\nspiritual, and the teaching of service and sacrifice, should be kept\nconstantly in view.\nAbove any other agency, service for Christ\u2019s sake in the little\nthings of everyday experience has power to mold the character and\nto direct the life into lines of unselfish ministry. To awaken this\nspirit, to encourage and rightly to direct it, is the parents\u2019 and the\nteacher\u2019s work. No more important work could be committed to\nthem. The spirit of ministry is the spirit of heaven, and with every\neffort to develop and encourage it angels will co-operate.\nSuch an education must be based upon the word of God. Here\nonly are its principles given in their fullness. The Bible should\nbe made the foundation of study and of teaching. The essential\nknowledge is a knowledge of God and of Him whom He has sent.\nEvery child and every youth should have a knowledge of himself.[402]\nHe should understand the physical habitation that God has given\nhim, and the laws by which it is kept in health. All should be\nthoroughly grounded in the common branches of education. And\nthey should have industrial training that will make them men and\nwomen of practical ability, fitted for the duties of everyday life. To\nthis should be added training and practical experience in various\nlines of missionary effort.\nLearning by Imparting\nLet the youth advance as fast and as far as they can in the acquisi-\ntion of knowledge. Let their field of study be as broad as their powers\nTrue Education, a Missionary Training 273\ncan compass. And, as they learn, let them impart their knowledge.\nIt is thus that their minds will acquire discipline and power. It is\nthe use they make of knowledge that determines the value of their\neducation. To spend a long time in study, with no effort to impart\nwhat is gained, often proves a hindrance rather than a help to real\ndevelopment. In both the home and the school it should be the stu-\ndent\u2019s effort to learn how to study and how to impart the knowledge\ngained. Whatever his calling, he is to be both a learner and a teacher\nas long as life shall last. Thus he may advance continually, making\nGod his trust, clinging to Him who is infinite in wisdom, who can\nreveal the secrets hidden for ages, who can solve the most difficult\nproblems for minds that believe in Him.\nGod\u2019s word places great stress upon the influence of association,\neven upon men and women. How much greater is its power on the\ndeveloping mind and character of children and youth. The company\nthey keep, the principles they adopt, the habits they form, will decide\nthe question of their usefulness here and of their future, eternal\ninterest.\nIt is a terrible fact, and one that should make the hearts of parents [403]\ntremble, that in so many schools and colleges to which the youth are\nsent for mental culture and discipline, influences prevail which mis-\nshape the character, divert the mind from life\u2019s true aims, and debase\nthe morals. Through contact with the irreligious, the pleasure loving,\nand the corrupt, many, many youth lose the simplicity and purity,\nthe faith in God, and the spirit of self-sacrifice that Christian fathers\nand mothers have cherished and guarded by careful instruction and\nearnest prayer.\nMany who enter school with the purpose of fitting themselves for\nsome line of unselfish ministry become absorbed in secular studies.\nAn ambition is aroused to win distinction in scholarship and to gain\nposition and honor in the world. The purpose for which they entered\nschool is lost sight of, and the life is given up to selfish and worldly\npursuits. And often habits are formed that ruin the life both for this\nworld and for the world to come.\nAs a rule, men and women who have broad ideas, unselfish pur-\nposes, noble aspirations, are those in whom these characteristics\nwere developed by their associations in early years. In all His deal-\nings with Israel, God urged upon them the importance of guarding\n274 The Ministry of Healing\nthe associations of their children. All the arrangements of civil,\nreligious, and social life were made with a view to preserving the\nchildren from harmful companionship and making them, from their\nearliest years, familiar with the precepts and principles of the law\nof God. The object lesson given at the birth of the nation was of a\nnature deeply to impress all hearts. Before the last terrible judgment\ncame upon the Egyptians in the death of the first-born, God com-\nmanded His people to gather their children into their own homes.\nThe doorpost of every house was marked with blood, and within the\nprotection assured by this token all were to abide. So today parents\nwho love and fear God are to keep their children under \u201cthe bond\nof the covenant\u201d \u2014within the protection of those sacred influences[404]\nmade possible through Christ\u2019s redeeming blood.\nOf His disciples Christ said, \u201cI have given them Thy word; and\n... they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.\u201d John\n17:14.\n\u201cBe not conformed to this world,\u201d God bids us; \u201cbut be ye trans-\nformed by the renewing of your mind.\u201d Romans 12:2.\n\u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what\nfellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what com-\nmunion hath light with darkness? ... and what agreement hath the\ntemple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God;\nas God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will\nbe their God, and they shall be My people. Wherefore\n\u201cCome out from among them, and be ye separate, ...\nAnd touch not the unclean; ...\nAnd I will receive you,\nAnd will be a Father unto you,\nAnd ye shall be My sons and daughters,\nSaith the Lord Almighty.\u201d\n2 Corinthians 6:14-18.\n\u201cGather the children.\u201d \u201cMake them know the statutes of God,\nand His laws.\u201d Joel 2:16; Exodus 18:16.\n\u201cPut My name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless them.\u201d\nNumbers 6:27.\nTrue Education, a Missionary Training 275\n\u201cAnd all the peoples of the earth shall see that thou art called by\nthe name of Jehovah.\u201d Deuteronomy 28:10, A.R.V .\n\u201cThe remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many\npeople\nAs a dew from the Lord,\nAs the showers upon the grass,\nThat tarrieth not for man,\nNor waiteth for the sons of men.\u201d\nMicah 5:7.\nWe are numbered with Israel. All the instruction given to the Is- [405]\nraelites of old concerning the education and training of their children,\nall the promises of blessing through obedience, are for us.\nGod\u2019s word to us is, \u201cI will bless thee, ... and thou shalt be a\nblessing.\u201d Genesis 12:2.\nOf the first disciples and of all who should believe on Him\nthrough their word Christ said, \u201cThe glory which Thou gavest Me\nI have given them; that they may be one, even as We are one: I in\nthem, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and\nthat the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved\nthem, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d John 17:22, 23.\nWonderful, wonderful words, almost beyond the grasp of faith!\nThe Creator of all worlds loves those who give themselves to His\nservice, even as He loves His son. Even here and now His gracious\nfavor is bestowed upon us to this marvelous extent. He has given us\nthe Light and Majesty of heaven, and with Him He has bestowed all\nthe heavenly treasure. Much as He has promised us for the life to\ncome, He bestows princely gifts in this life. As subjects of His grace,\nHe desires us to enjoy everything that will ennoble, expand, and\nelevate our characters. He is waiting to inspire the youth with power\nfrom above, that they may stand under the blood-stained banner of\nChrist, to work as He worked, to lead souls into safe paths, to plant\nthe feet of many upon the Rock of Ages.\nAll who are seeking to work in harmony with God\u2019s plan of\neducation will have His sustaining grace, His continual presence,\nHis keeping power. To everyone He says:\n276 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cBe strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou\ndismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee.\u201d \u201cI will not fail thee,\nnor forsake thee.\u201d Joshua 1:9, 5.\n\u201cAs the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, [406]\nAnd returneth not thither,\nBut watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud,\nThat it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:\nSo shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth:\nIt shall not return unto Me void,\nBut it shall accomplish that which I please,\nAnd it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.\nFor ye shall go out with joy,\nAnd be led forth with peace:\nThe mountains and the hills shall break forth before\nyou into singing,\nAnd all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.\nInstead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree,\nAnd instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:\nAnd it shall be to the Lord for a name,\nFor an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.\u201d\nIsaiah 55:10-13.\nThroughout the world, society is in disorder, and a thorough\ntransformation is needed. The education given to the youth is to\nmold the whole social fabric.\n\u201cThey shall build the old wastes,\nThey shall raise up the former desolations,\nAnd they shall repair the waste cities,\nThe desolations of many generations.\u201d\nMen shall call them \u201cthe ministers of our God....\nEverlasting joy shall be unto them.\nFor I, Jehovah, love justice.\u201d\n\u201cI will direct their work in truth,\nAnd I will make an everlasting covenant with them.\u201d\n\u201cTheir race shall be illustrious among the nations,\nTrue Education, a Missionary Training 277\nAnd their offspring among the people;\nAll that see them shall acknowledge\nThat they are a race which Jehovah hath blessed....\nFor as the earth putteth forth her shoots,\nAnd as a garden causeth its plants to spring forth,\nSo shall the Lord Jehovah cause salvation to spring forth,\nAnd praise before all the nations.\u201d\nIsaiah 61:4, 6-8, Noyes; 61:8;\n61:9, 11, Noyes.\n278 The Ministry of Healing\nThe Essential Knowledge [407]\n[408]\n\u201cThe light of the knowledge of the glory of God. \u201d\nChapter 35\u2014A True Knowledge of God[409]\nLike our Saviour, we are in this world to do service for God. We\nare here to become like God in character, and by a life of service\nto reveal Him to the world. In order to be co-workers with God, in\norder to become like Him and to reveal His character, we must know\nHim aright. We must know Him as He reveals Himself.\nA knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education and\nof all true service. It is the only real safeguard against temptation. It\nis this alone that can make us like God in character.\nThis is the knowledge needed by all who are working for the\nuplifting of their fellow men. Transformation of character, purity of\nlife, efficiency in service, adherence to correct principles, all depend\nupon a right knowledge of God. This knowledge is the essential\npreparation both for this life and for the life to come.\n\u201cThe knowledge of the Holy is understanding.\u201d Proverbs 9:10.\nThrough a knowledge of Him are given unto us \u201call things that\npertain unto life and godliness.\u201d 2 Peter 1:3.\n\u201cThis is life eternal,\u201d said Jesus, \u201cthat they might know Thee the[410]\nonly true God, and Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent.\u201d John 17:3.\n\u201cThus saith the Lord,\nLet not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\nNeither let the mighty man glory in his might,\nLet not the rich man glory in his riches:\nBut let him that glorieth glory in this,\nThat he understandeth and knoweth Me,\nThat I am the Lord which exercise loving-kindness,\nJudgment, and righteousness, in the earth:\nFor in these things I delight, saith the Lord.\u201d\nJeremiah 9:23, 24.\nWe need to study the revelations of Himself that God has given.\n280\nTrue Knowledge of God 281\n\u201cAcquaint now thyself with Him,\nAnd be at peace:\nThereby good shall come unto thee.\nReceive, I pray thee, the law from His mouth,\nAnd lay up His words in thy heart....\nAnd the Almighty will be thy treasure....\n\u201cThen shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty,\nAnd shalt lift up thy face unto God.\nThou shalt make thy prayer unto Him,\nAnd He will hear thee;\nAnd thou shalt pay thy vows.\nThou shalt also decree a thing,\nAnd it shall be established unto thee;\nAnd light shall shine upon thy ways.\nWhen they cast thee down, thou shalt say,\nThere is lifting up;\nAnd the humble person He will save.\u201d\nJob 22:21-29, A.R.V .\n\u201cThe invisible things of Him since the creation of the world are\nclearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even\nHis everlasting power and divinity.\u201d Romans 1:20, A.R.V .\nThe things of nature that we now behold give us but a faint [411]\nconception of Eden\u2019s glory. Sin has marred earth\u2019s beauty; on all\nthings may be seen traces of the work of evil. Yet much that is\nbeautiful remains. Nature testifies that One infinite in power, great\nin goodness, mercy, and love, created the earth, and filled it with\nlife and gladness. Even in their blighted state, all things reveal the\nhandiwork of the great Master Artist. Wherever we turn, we may\nhear the voice of God, and see evidences of His goodness.\nFrom the solemn roll of the deep-toned thunder and old ocean\u2019s\nceaseless roar, to the glad songs that make the forests vocal with\nmelody, nature\u2019s ten thousand voices speak His praise. In earth and\nsea and sky, with their marvelous tint and color, varying in gorgeous\ncontrast or blended in harmony, we behold His glory. The everlasting\nhills tell us of His power. The trees that wave their green banners in\nthe sunlight, and the flowers in their delicate beauty, point to their\n282 The Ministry of Healing\nCreator. The living green that carpets the brown earth tells of God\u2019s\ncare for the humblest of His creatures. The caves of the sea and the[412]\ndepths of the earth reveal His treasures. He who placed the pearls in\nthe ocean and the amethyst and chrysolite among the rocks, is a lover\nof the beautiful. The sun rising in the heavens is a representative\nof Him who is the life and light of all that He has made. All the\nbrightness and beauty that adorn the earth and light up the heavens,\nspeak of God.\n\u201cHis glory covered the heavens.\u201d\n\u201cThe earth is full of Thy riches.\u201d\n\u201cDay unto day uttereth speech,\nAnd night unto night showeth knowledge.\nThere is no speech nor language,\nWithout these their voice is heard.\nTheir line is gone out through all the earth,\nAnd their words to the end of the world.\u201d\nHabakkuk 3:3; Psalm\n104:24; Psalm 19:2-4,\nmargin.\nAll things tell of His tender, fatherly care and of His desire to\nmake His children happy.\nThe mighty power that works through all nature and sustains[413]\nall things is not, as some men of science represent, merely an all-\npervading principle, an actuating energy. God is a Spirit; yet He is a\npersonal Being; for so He has revealed Himself:\n\u201cThe Lord is the true God,\nHe is the living God, and an everlasting King: ...\nThe gods that have not made the heavens and the earth,\nEven they shall perish from the earth, and from under\nthese heavens.\u201d\n\u201cThe portion of Jacob is not like them:\nFor He is the former of all things.\u201d\nTrue Knowledge of God 283\n\u201cHe hath made the earth by His power,\nHe hath established the world by His wisdom,\nAnd hath stretched out the heavens by His discretion.\u201d\nJeremiah 10:10, 11, 16, 12.\nNature Is Not God\nGod\u2019s handiwork in nature is not God Himself in nature. The\nthings of nature are an expression of God\u2019s character and power;\nbut we are not to regard nature as God. The artistic skill of human\nbeings produces very beautiful workmanship, things that delight the\neye, and these things reveal to us something of the thought of the\ndesigner; but the thing made is not the maker. It is not the work, but\nthe workman, that is counted worthy of honor. So while nature is an\nexpression of God\u2019s thought, it is not nature, but the God of nature,\nthat is to be exalted.\n\u201cLet us worship and bow down:\nLet us kneel before the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cIn His hand are the deep places of the earth;\nThe heights of the mountains are His also.\nThe sea is His, and He made it;\nAnd His hands formed the dry land.\u201d\nPsalm 95:6; 95:4, 5, A.R.V .\n\u201cSeek Him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, [414]\nAnd turneth the shadow of death into the morning,\nAnd maketh the day dark with night;\u201d\n\u201cHe that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,\nAnd declareth unto man what is His thought;\u201d\n\u201cHe that buildeth His spheres in the heaven,\nAnd hath founded His arch [Noyes\u2019s translation]\nin the earth;\u201d\n\u201cHe that calleth for the waters of the sea,\n284 The Ministry of Healing\nAnd poureth them out upon the face of the earth;\nJehovah is His name.\u201d\nAmos 5:8, A.R.V .; Amos\n4:13, A.R.V .; Amos 9:6,\nmargin; Amos 9:6, A.R.V .\nThe Creation of the Earth\nThe work of creation cannot be explained by science. What\nscience can explain the mystery of life?\n\u201cThrough faith we understand that the worlds were framed by\nthe word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of\nthings which do appear.\u201d Hebrews 11:3.\n\u201cI form the light, and create darkness: ...\nI the Lord do all these things....\nI have made the earth,\nAnd created man upon it:\nI, even My hands, have stretched out the heavens,\nAnd all their host have I commanded.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I call unto them, they stand up together.\u201d\nIsaiah 45:7-12; 48:13.\nIn the creation of the earth, God was not indebted to pre-existing\nmatter. \u201cHe spake, and it was; ... He commanded, and it stood fast.\u201d\nPsalm 33:9. All things, material or spiritual, stood up before the\nLord Jehovah at His voice and were created for His own purpose.\nThe heavens and all the host of them, the earth and all things therein,[415]\ncame into existence by the breath of His mouth.\nIn the creation of man was manifest the agency of a personal\nGod. When God had made man in His image, the human form\nwas perfect in all its arrangements, but it was without life. Then a\npersonal, self-existing God breathed into that form the breath of life,\nand man became a living, intelligent being. All parts of the human\norganism were set in action. The heart, the arteries, the veins, the\ntongue, the hands, the feet, the senses, the faculties of the mind, all\nbegan their work, and all were placed under law. Man became a\nliving soul. Through Christ the Word, a personal God created man\nand endowed him with intelligence and power.\nTrue Knowledge of God 285\nOur substance was not hid from Him when we were made in\nsecret; His eyes saw our substance, yet being imperfect, and in His\nbook all our members were written when as yet there were none of\nthem.\nAbove all lower orders of being, God designed that man, the\ncrowning work of His creation, should express His thought and\nreveal His glory. But man is not to exalt himself as God.\n\u201cMake a joyful noise unto the Lord....\nServe the Lord with gladness:\nCome before His presence with singing.\nKnow ye that the Lord He is God:\nIt is He that hath made us, and His we are;\nWe are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.\nEnter into His gates with thanksgiving,\nAnd into His courts with praise:\nBe thankful unto Him, and bless His name.\u201d\n\u201cExalt the Lord our God,\nAnd worship at His holy hill;\nFor the Lord our God is holy.\u201d\nPsalm 100:1-4, margin;\nPsalm 99:9.\nGod is constantly employed in upholding and using as His ser- [416]\nvants the things that He has made. He works through the laws of\nnature, using them as His instruments. They are not self-acting.\nNature in her work testifies of the intelligent presence and active\nagency of a Being who moves in all things according to His will.\n\u201cForever, O Lord,\nThy word is settled in heaven.\nThy faithfulness is unto all generations:\nThou hast established the earth, and it abideth.\nThey continue this day according to Thine ordinances:\nFor all are Thy servants.\u201d\n\u201cWhatsoever the Lord pleased, that did He\nIn heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.\u201d\n\u201cHe commanded, and they were created.\n286 The Ministry of Healing\nHe hath also established them for ever and ever:\nHe hath made a decree which shall not pass.\u201d\nPsalm 119:89-91; 135:6;\n148:5, 6.\nIt is not by inherent power that year by year the earth yields its\nbounties and continues its march around the sun. The hand of the\nInfinite One is perpetually at work guiding this planet. It is God\u2019s\npower continually exercised that keeps the earth in position in its\nrotation. It is God who causes the sun to rise in the heavens. He\nopens the windows of heaven and gives rain.\n\u201cHe giveth snow like wool:\nHe scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.\u201d\n\u201cWhen He uttereth His voice, there is a multitude of waters\nin the heavens,\nAnd He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the\nearth;\nHe maketh lightnings with rain,\nAnd bringeth forth the wind out of His treasures.\u201d\nPsalm 147:16; Jeremiah\n10:13.\nIt is by His power that vegetation is caused to flourish, that every\nleaf appears, every flower blooms, every fruit develops.\nThe mechanism of the human body cannot be fully understood;[417]\nit presents mysteries that baffle the most intelligent. It is not as the\nresult of a mechanism, which, once set in motion, continues its work,\nthat the pulse beats and breath follows breath. In God we live and\nmove and have our being. The beating heart, the throbbing pulse,\nevery nerve and muscle in the living organism, is kept in order and\nactivity by the power of an ever-present God.\nThe Bible shows us God in His high and holy place, not in a\nstate of inactivity, not in silence and solitude, but surrounded by ten\nthousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands of holy\nbeings, all waiting to do His will. Through these messengers He is\nin active communication with every part of His dominion. By His\nTrue Knowledge of God 287\nSpirit He is everywhere present. Through the agency of His Spirit\nand His angels He ministers to the children of men.\nAbove the distractions of the earth He sits enthroned; all things\nare open to His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity\nHe orders that which His providence sees best.\n\u201cThe way of man is not in himself:\nIt is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.\u201d\n\u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart....\nIn all thy ways acknowledge Him,\nAnd He shall direct thy paths.\u201d\n\u201cThe eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him,\nUpon them that hope in His mercy;\nTo deliver their soul from death,\nAnd to keep them alive in famine.\u201d\n\u201cHow precious is Thy loving-kindness, O God! ...\nThe children of men take refuge under the shadow\nof Thy wings.\u201d\n\u201cHappy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,\nWhose hope is in the Lord his God.\u201d\n\u201cThe earth, O Jehovah, is full of Thy loving-kindness.\u201d [418]\nThou lovest \u201crighteousness and justice.\u201d\nThou \u201cart the confidence of all the ends of the earth,\nAnd of them that are afar off upon the sea:\nWho by His strength setteth fast the mountains,\nBeing girded about with might;\nWho stilleth the roaring of the seas, ...\nAnd the tumult of the peoples.\u201d\n\u201cThou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening\nto rejoice.\u201d\n\u201cThou crownest the year with Thy goodness;\nAnd Thy paths drop fatness.\u201d\n288 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cThe Lord upholdeth all that fall,\nAnd raiseth up all those that be bowed down.\nThe eyes of all wait upon Thee;\nAnd Thou givest them their meat in due season.\nThou openest Thine hand,\nAnd satisfiest the desire of every living thing.\u201d\nJeremiah 10:23; Proverbs\n3:5, 6; Psalm 33:18, 19;\nPsalm 36:7, A.R.V .; Psalm\n146:5; Psalm 119:64,\nA.R.V .; Psalm 33:5, A.R.V .;\nPsalm 65:5-7, A.R.V .; Psalm\n65:8, 11; Psalm 145:14-16.\nPersonality of God Revealed in Christ\nAs a personal being, God has revealed Himself in His Son. The\noutshining of the Father\u2019s glory, \u201cand the express image of His\nperson,\u201d Jesus, as a personal Saviour, came to the world. As a[419]\npersonal Saviour He ascended on high. As a personal Saviour He\nintercedes in the heavenly courts. Before the throne of God in our\nbehalf ministers \u201cOne like unto the Son of man.\u201d Hebrews 1:3;\nRevelation 1:13.\nChrist, the Light of the world, veiled the dazzling splendor of\nHis divinity and came to live as a man among men, that they might,\nwithout being consumed, become acquainted with their Creator.\nSince sin brought separation between man and his Maker, no man\nhas seen God at any time, except as He is manifested through Christ.\n\u201cI and My Father are one,\u201d Christ declared. \u201cNo man knoweth\nthe Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the\nSon, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\u201d John 10:30;\nMatthew 11:27.\nChrist came to teach human beings what God desires them to\nknow. In the heavens above, in the earth, in the broad waters of\nthe ocean, we see the handiwork of God. All created things testify\nto His power, His wisdom, His love. Yet not from the stars or the\nocean or the cataract can we learn of the personality of God as it\nwas revealed in Christ.\nTrue Knowledge of God 289\nGod saw that a clearer revelation than nature was needed to\nportray both His personality and His character. He sent His Son into\nthe world to manifest, so far as could be endured by human sight,\nthe nature and the attributes of the invisible God.\nRevealed to the Disciples\nLet us study the words that Christ spoke in the upper chamber\non the night before His crucifixion. He was nearing His hour of trial,\nand He sought to comfort His disciples, who were to be so severely\ntempted and tried.\n\u201cLet not your heart be troubled,\u201d He said. \u201cYe believe in God,\nbelieve also in Me. In My Father\u2019s house are many mansions: if it\nwere not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you....\n\u201cThomas saith unto Him, Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; [420]\nand how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way,\nthe truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me. If\nye had known Me, ye should have known My Father also: and from\nhenceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him....\n\u201cLord, show us the Father,\u201d said Philip, \u201cand it sufficeth us. Jesus\nsaith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou\nnot known Me, Philip? he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father;\nand how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? Believest thou not\nthat I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? the words that I speak\nunto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me,\nHe doeth the works.\u201d John 14:1-10.\nThe disciples did not yet understand Christ\u2019s words concerning\nHis relation to God. Much of His teaching was still dark to them.\nChrist desired them to have a clearer, more distinct knowledge of\nGod.\n\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you in parables,\u201d He said; \u201cbut\nthe time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in parables,\nbut I shall show you plainly of the Father.\u201d John 16:25, margin.\nWhen, on the Day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out\non the disciples, they understood more fully the truths that Christ had\nspoken in parables. Much of the teaching that had been a mystery\nto them was made clear. But not even then did the disciples receive\nthe complete fulfillment of Christ\u2019s promise. They received all the\n290 The Ministry of Healing\nknowledge of God that they could bear, but the complete fulfillment\nof the promise that Christ would show them plainly of the Father\nwas yet to come. Thus it is today. Our knowledge of God is partial\nand imperfect. When the conflict is ended, and the Man Christ Jesus\nacknowledges before the Father His faithful workers, who in a world\nof sin have borne true witness for Him, they will understand clearly\nwhat now are mysteries to them.\nChrist took with Him to the heavenly courts His glorified hu-[421]\nmanity. To those who receive Him He gives power to become the\nsons of God, that at last God may receive them as His, to dwell\nwith Him throughout eternity. If during this life they are loyal to\nGod, they will at last \u201csee His face; and His name shall be in their\nforeheads.\u201d Revelation 22:4. And what is the happiness of heaven\nbut to see God? What greater joy could come to the sinner saved by\nthe grace of Christ than to look upon the face of God and know Him\nas Father?\nThe Scriptures clearly indicate the relation between God and\nChrist, and they bring to view as clearly the personality and individ-\nuality of each.\n\u201cGod, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time\npast unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in these last days spoken\nunto us by His Son; ... who being the brightness of His glory, and\nthe express image of His person, and upholding all things by the\nword of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat\ndown on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made so much\nbetter than the angels, as He hath by inheritance obtained a more\nexcellent name than they. For unto which of the angels said He at\nany time.\n\u201cThou art My Son,\nThis day have I begotten Thee?\nAnd again,\nI will be to Him a Father,\nAnd He shall be to Me a Son?\u201d\nHebrews 1:1-5.\nTrue Knowledge of God 291\nThe personality of the Father and the Son, also the unity that\nexists between Them, are presented in the seventeenth chapter of\nJohn, in the prayer of Christ for His disciples:\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall\nbelieve on Me through their word; that they all may be one; as Thou, [422]\nFather, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us:\nthat the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d John 17:20, 21.\nThe unity that exists between Christ and His disciples does not\ndestroy the personality of either. They are one in purpose, in mind,\nin character, but not in person. It is thus that God and Christ are one.\nCharacter of God Revealed in Christ\nTaking humanity upon Him, Christ came to be one with hu-\nmanity, and at the same time to reveal our heavenly Father to sinful\nhuman beings. He who had been in the presence of the Father from\nthe beginning, He who was the express image of the invisible God,\nwas alone able to reveal the character of the Deity to mankind. He\nwas in all things made like unto His brethren. He became flesh even\nas we are. He was hungry and thirsty and weary. He was sustained\nby food and refreshed by sleep. He shared the lot of men; yet He was\nthe blameless Son of God. He was a stranger and sojourner on the\nearth\u2014in the world, but not of the world; tempted and tried as men\nand women today are tempted and tried, yet living a life free from [423]\nsin. Tender, compassionate, sympathetic, ever considerate of others,\nHe represented the character of God, and was constantly engaged in\nservice for God and man.\n\u201cJehovah hath anointed Me,\u201d He said,\n\u201cTo preach good tidings unto the poor;\nHe hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted,\nTo proclaim liberty to the captives,\u201d\n\u201cAnd recovering of sight to the blind;\u201d\n\u201cTo proclaim the year of Jehovah\u2019s favor; ...\nTo comfort all that mourn.\u201d\nIsaiah 61:1, A.R.V .,\nmargin; Luke 4:18; Isaiah",

Its full\nsignificance tongue cannot utter, pen cannot portray, the mind of\nman cannot comprehend. Looking upon the cross of Calvary, we can[424]\nonly say, \u201cGod so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten\nSon, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have\neverlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nChrist crucified for our sins, Christ risen from the dead, Christ\nascended on high, is the science of salvation that we are to learn and\nto teach.\nIt Was Christ\n\u201cWho, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on\nan equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself,\ntaking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and\nbeing found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming\nobedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.\u201d Philippians",

Every flower, with its delicate tints and its\nfragrance, is given for our enjoyment through that one Gift. The\nsun and the moon were made by Him. There is not a star which\nbeautifies the heavens that He did not make. Every drop of rain that\nfalls, every ray of light shed upon our unthankful world, testifies to\nthe love of God in Christ. Everything is supplied to us through the [425]\none unspeakable Gift, God\u2019s only-begotten Son. He was nailed to\nthe cross that all these bounties might flow to God\u2019s workmanship.\n\u201cBehold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,\nthat we should be called the sons of God.\u201d 1 John 3:1.\n\u201cMen have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,\nNeither hath the eye seen a God besides Thee,\nWho worketh for him that waiteth for Him.\u201d\nIsaiah 64:4, A.R.V .\nThe Knowledge That Works Transformation\nThe knowledge of God as revealed in Christ is the knowledge\nthat all who are saved must have. It is the knowledge that works\ntransformation of character. This knowledge, received, will re-create\nthe soul in the image of God. It will impart to the whole being a\nspiritual power that is divine.\n\u201cWe all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of\nthe Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 3:18.\nOf His own life the Saviour said, \u201cI have kept My Father\u2019s [426]\ncommandments.\u201d John 15:10. \u201cThe Father hath not left Me alone;\nfor I do always those things that please Him.\u201d John 8:29. As Jesus\nwas in human nature, so God means His followers to be. In His\n294 The Ministry of Healing\nstrength we are to live the life of purity and nobility which the\nSaviour lived.\n\u201cFor this cause,\u201d Paul says, \u201cI bow my knees unto the Father\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and\nearth is named, that He would grant you, according to the riches of\nHis glory, to be strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner\nman; that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being\nrooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all\nsaints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to\nknow the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be\nfilled with all the fullness of God.\u201d Ephesians 3:14-19.\nWe \u201cdo not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might\nbe filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiri-\ntual understanding; that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all\npleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the\nknowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His\nglorious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness.\u201d\nColossians 1:9-11.\nThis is the knowledge which God is inviting us to receive, and\nbeside which all else is vanity and nothingness.\nChapter 36\u2014Danger in Speculative Knowledge [427]\nOne of the greatest evils that attends the quest for knowledge, the\ninvestigations of science, is the disposition to exalt human reasoning\nabove its true value and its proper sphere. Many attempt to judge\nof the Creator and His works by their own imperfect knowledge of\nscience. They endeavor to determine the nature and attributes and\nprerogatives of God, and indulge in speculative theories concerning\nthe Infinite One. Those who engage in this line of study are treading\nupon forbidden ground. Their research will yield no valuable results\nand can be pursued only at the peril of the soul.\nOur first parents were led into sin through indulging a desire for\nknowledge that God had withheld from them. In seeking to gain this\nknowledge, they lost all that was worth possessing. If Adam and\nEve had never touched the forbidden tree, God would have imparted\nto them knowledge\u2014knowledge upon which rested no curse of sin,\nknowledge that would have brought them everlasting joy. All that\nthey gained by listening to the tempter was an acquaintance with sin [428]\nand its results. By their disobedience, humanity was estranged from\nGod and the earth was separated from heaven.\nThe lesson is for us. The field into which Satan led our first\nparents is the same to which he is alluring men today. He is flooding\nthe world with pleasing fables. By every device at his command he\ntempts men to speculate in regard to God. Thus he seeks to prevent\nthem from obtaining that knowledge of God which is salvation.\nPantheistic Theories\nToday there are coming into educational institutions and into the\nchurches everywhere spiritualistic teachings that undermine faith in\nGod and in His word. The theory that God is an essence pervading\nall nature is received by many who profess to believe the Scriptures;\nbut, however beautifully clothed, this theory is a most dangerous\ndeception. It misrepresents God and is a dishonor to His greatness\n295\n296 The Ministry of Healing\nand majesty. And it surely tends not only to mislead, but to debase\nmen. Darkness is its element, sensuality its sphere. The result of\naccepting it is separation from God. And to fallen human nature this\nmeans ruin.\nOur condition through sin is unnatural, and the power that re-\nstores us must be supernatural, else it has no value. There is but one\npower that can break the hold of evil from the hearts of men, and\nthat is the power of God in Jesus Christ. Only through the blood of\nthe Crucified One is there cleansing from sin. His grace alone can\nenable us to resist and subdue the tendencies of our fallen nature.\nThe spiritualistic theories concerning God make His grace of no\neffect. If God is an essence pervading all nature, then He dwells in\nall men; and in order to attain holiness, man has only to develop the\npower within him.\nThese theories, followed to their logical conclusion, sweep away\nthe whole Christian economy. They do away with the necessity\nfor the atonement and make man his own savior. These theories[429]\nregarding God make His word of no effect, and those who accept\nthem are in great danger of being led finally to look upon the whole\nBible as a fiction. They may regard virtue as better than vice; but,\nhaving shut out God from His rightful position of sovereignty, they\nplace their dependence upon human power, which, without God, is\nworthless. The unaided human will has no real power to resist and\novercome evil. The defenses of the soul are broken down. Man has\nno barrier against sin. When once the restraints of God\u2019s word and\nHis Spirit are rejected, we know not to what depths one may sink.\n\u201cEvery word of God is pure:\nHe is a shield unto them that put their trust in Him.\nAdd thou not unto His words,\nLest He reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.\u201d\n\u201cHis own iniquities shall take the wicked himself,\nAnd he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.\u201d\nProverbs 30:5, 6; 5:22.\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 297\nSearching Into Divine Mysteries\n\u201cThe secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those\nthings which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 29:29. The revelation of Himself that God has given\nin His word is for our study. This we may seek to understand. But\nbeyond this we are not to penetrate. The highest intellect may tax\nitself until it is wearied out in conjectures regarding the nature of\nGod, but the effort will be fruitless. This problem has not been\ngiven us to solve. No human mind can comprehend God. None\nare to indulge in speculation regarding His nature. Here silence is\neloquence. The Omniscient One is above discussion.\nEven the angels were not permitted to share the counsels between\nthe Father and the Son when the plan of salvation was laid. And\nhuman beings are not to intrude into the secrets of the Most High.\nWe are as ignorant of God as little children; but, as little children,\nwe may love and obey Him. Instead of speculating in regard to His [430]\nnature or His prerogatives, let us give heed to the words He has\nspoken:\n\u201cCanst thou by searching find out God?\nCanst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?\nIt is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?\nDeeper than hell; what canst thou know?\nThe measure thereof is longer than the earth,\nAnd broader than the sea.\u201d\n\u201cWhere shall wisdom be found?\nAnd where is the place of understanding?\nMan knoweth not the price thereof;\nNeither is it found in the land of the living.\nThe depth saith, It is not in me:\nAnd the sea saith, It is not with me.\nIt cannot be gotten for gold,\nNeither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.\nIt cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,\nWith the precious onyx, or the sapphire.\nThe gold and the crystal cannot equal it:\nAnd the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of\n298 The Ministry of Healing\nfine gold.\nNo mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls:\nFor the price of wisdom is above rubies.\nThe topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,\nNeither shall it be valued with pure gold.\nWhence then cometh wisdom?\nAnd where is the place of understanding? ...\nDestruction and death say,\nWe have heard the fame thereof with our ears.\nGod understandeth the way thereof,\nAnd He knoweth the place of thereof.\n\u201cFor He looketh to the ends of the earth,\nAnd seeth under the whole heaven....\nWhen He made a decree for the rain,\nAnd a way for the lightning of the thunder:\nThen did He see it, and declare it;\nHe prepared it, yea, and searched it out.\nAnd unto man He said,\nBehold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom;\nAnd to depart from evil is understanding.\u201d\nJob 11:7-9; 28:12-28.\nNeither by searching the recesses of the earth nor in vain endeav-[431]\nors to penetrate the mysteries of God\u2019s being, is wisdom found. It is\nfound, rather, in humbly receiving the revelation that He has been\npleased to give, and in conforming the life to His will.\nMen of the greatest intellect cannot understand the mysteries\nof Jehovah as revealed in nature. Divine inspiration asks many\nquestions which the most profound scholar cannot answer. These\nquestions were not asked that we might answer them, but to call\nour attention to the deep mysteries of God and to teach us that our\nwisdom is limited; that in the surroundings of our daily life there are\nmany things beyond the comprehension of finite beings.\nSkeptics refuse to believe in God because they cannot compre-\nhend the infinite power by which He reveals Himself. But God\nis to be acknowledged as much from what He does not reveal of\nHimself, as from that which is open to our limited comprehension.\nBoth in divine revelation and in nature, God has given mysteries to\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 299\ncommand our faith. This must be so. We may be ever searching,\never inquiring, ever learning, and yet there is an infinity beyond.\n\u201cWho hath measured the waters in the hollow of His hand,\nAnd meted out heaven with the span,\nAnd comprehend the dust of the earth in a measure,\nAnd weighed the mountains in scales,\nAnd the hills in a balance?\nWho hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah,\nOr being His counselor hath taught Him? ...\nBehold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket,\nAnd are accounted as the small dust of the balance:\nBehold, He taketh up the isles as a very little thing.\nAnd Lebanon is not sufficient to burn,\nNor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.\nAll the nations are as nothing before Him;\nThey are accounted by Him as less than nothing, and vanity.\n\u201cTo whom then will ye liken God? [432]\nOr what likeness will ye compare unto Him? ...\nHave ye not known?\nHave ye not heard?\nHath it not been told you from the beginning?\nHave ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?\nIt is He that sitteth above the circle of the earth,\nAnd the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers;\nThat stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain,\nAnd spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in....\nTo whom then will ye liken Me? ...\nSaith the Holy One.\nLift up your eyes on high,\nAnd see who hath created these,\nThat bringeth out their host by number;\nHe calleth them all by name;\nBy the greatness of His might, and for that He is strong\nin power,\nNot one is lacking.\n\u201cWhy sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel,\n300 The Ministry of Healing\nMy way is hid from Jehovah,\nAnd the justice due to me is passed away from my God?\nHast thou not known?\nHast thou not heard?\nThe everlasting God, Jehovah,\nThe Creator of the ends of the earth,\nFainteth not, neither is weary;\nThere is no searching of His understanding.\u201d\nIsaiah 40:12-28, A.R.V .\nFrom the representations given by the Holy Spirit to His\nprophets, let us learn the greatness of our God. The prophet Isaiah\nwrites:\n\u201cIn the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon\na throne, high and lifted up; and His train filled the temple. Above\nHim stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he\ncovered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain\nhe did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy,\nis Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of His glory. And the\nfoundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried,[433]\nand the house was filled with smoke.\n\u201cThen said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man\nof unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips:\nfor mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.\n\u201cThen flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in\nhis hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: and\nhe touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy\nlips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin expiated.\u201d Isaiah\n6:1-7, A.R.V ., margin.\n\u201cThere is none like unto Thee, O Lord;\nThou art great,\nAnd Thy name is great in might.\nWho would not fear Thee, O King of nations?\u201d\n\u201cO Lord, Thou hast searched me, and known me.\nThou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising,\nThou understandest my thought afar off.\nThou compassest my path and my lying down,\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 301\nAnd art acquainted with all my ways.\nFor there is not a word in my tongue,\nBut, lo, O Lord, Thou knowest it altogether.\nThou hast beset my behind and before,\nAnd laid Thine hand upon me.\nSuch knowledge is too wonderful for me;\nIt is high, I cannot attain unto it.\u201d\nJeremiah 10:6, 7; Psalm\n139:1-6.\n\u201cGreat is our Lord, and of great power: His understanding is\ninfinite.\u201d Psalm 147:5.\n\u201cThe ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and He\npondereth all his goings.\u201d Proverbs 5:21.\n\u201cHe revealeth the deep and secret things: He knoweth what is in\nthe darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.\u201d Daniel 2:22.\n\u201cKnown unto God are all His works from the beginning of the\nworld.\u201d \u201cWho hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been\nHis counselor? Or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be [434]\nrecompensed unto him again? For of Him, and through Him, and to\nHim, are all things: to whom be glory forever.\u201d Acts 15:18; Romans\n11:34-36.\n\u201cUnto the King eternal, immortal, invisible,\u201d \u201cwho only hath\nimmortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto;\nwhom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power\neverlasting.\u201d 1 Timothy 1:17; 6:16.\n\u201cShall not His excellency make you afraid?\nAnd His dread fall upon you?\u201d\n\u201cIs not God in the height of heaven?\nAnd behold the height of the stars, how high they are!\u201d\n\u201cIs there any number of His armies?\nAnd upon whom doth not His light arise?\u201d\n\u201cGreat things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend.\nFor He saith to the snow,\nFall thou on the earth;\nLikewise to the shower of rain,\nAnd to the showers of His mighty rain.\n302 The Ministry of Healing\nHe sealeth up the hand of every man,\nThat all men whom He hath made may know it....\nHe spreadeth abroad the cloud of His lightning:\nAnd it is turned round about by His guidance,\nThat they may do whatsoever He commandeth them\nUpon the face of the habitable world;\nWhether it be for correction, or for His land,\nOr for loving-kindness, that He cause it to come.\n\u201cHearken unto this:...\nStand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.\nDost thou know how God layeth His charge upon them,\nAnd causeth the lightning of His cloud to shine?\nDost thou know the balancings of the clouds,\nThe wondrous works of Him who is perfect in\nknowledge?...\nCanst thou with Him spread out the sky,\nWhich is strong as a molten mirror?\nTeach us what we shall say unto Him;\nFor we cannot set our speech in order by reason of\ndarkness....\nAnd now men cannot look on the light when it is bright\nin the skies,\n\u201cWhen the wind hath passed, and cleared them. [435]\nOut of the north cometh golden splendor:\nGod hath upon Him terrible majesty.\nTouching the Almighty, we cannot find Him out:\nHe is excellent in power;\nAnd in justice and plenteous righteousness....\nMen do therefore fear Him.\u201d\n\u201cWho is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,\nWho humbleth Himself to behold the things that are in\nheaven, and in the earth!\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm,\nAnd the clouds are the dust of His feet.\u201d\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 303\n\u201cGreat is the Lord, and greatly to be praised;\nAnd His greatness is unsearchable.\nOne generation shall praise Thy works to another,\nAnd shall declare Thy mighty acts.\nI will speak of the glorious honor of Thy majesty,\nAnd of Thy wondrous works.\nAnd men shall speak of the might of Thy terrible acts:\nAnd I will declare Thy greatness.\nThey shall abundantly utter the memory of Thy great\ngoodness,\nAnd shall sing of Thy righteousness....\n\u201cAll Thy works shall praise Thee, O Lord;\nAnd Thy saints shall bless Thee.\nThey shall speak of the glory of Thy kingdom,\nAnd talk of Thy power;\nTo make known to the sons of men His mighty acts,\nAnd the glorious majesty of His kingdom.\nThy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,\nAnd Thy dominion endureth throughout all generations....\nMy mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord:\nAnd let all flesh bless His holy name for ever and ever.\u201d\nJob 13:11; 22:12; Job 25:3;\n37:5-24, A.R.V ., margin;\nPsalm 113:5, 6; Nahum 1:3;\nPsalm 145:3-21.\nAs we learn more and more of what God is, and of what we\nourselves are in His sight, we shall fear and tremble before Him.\nLet men of today take warning from the fate of those who in ancient [436]\ntimes presumed to make free with that which God had declared\nsacred. When the Israelites ventured to open the ark on its return\nfrom the land of the Philistines, their irreverent daring was signally\npunished.\nAgain, consider the judgment that fell upon Uzzah. As in David\u2019s\nreign the ark was being carried to Jerusalem, Uzzah put forth his\nhand to keep it steady. For presuming to touch the symbol of God\u2019s\npresence, he was smitten with instant death.\n304 The Ministry of Healing\nAt the burning bush, when Moses, not recognizing God\u2019s pres-\nence, turned aside to behold the wonderful sight, the command was\ngiven:\n\u201cDraw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for\nthe place whereon thou standest is holy ground.... And Moses hid\nhis face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\u201d Exodus 3:5, 6.\n\u201cAnd Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.\nAnd he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night,\nbecause the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and\nput them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.\n\u201cAnd he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the\ntop of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending\nand descending on it. And, behold, the Lord stood above it, and\nsaid,\n\u201cI am the Lord God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac:\nthe land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed....\nAnd, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither\nthou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not\nleave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.\n\u201cAnd Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord[437]\nis in this place; and I knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How\ndreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and\nthis is the gate of heaven.\u201d Genesis 28:10-17.\nIn the sanctuary of the wilderness tabernacle and of the temple\nthat were the earthly symbols of God\u2019s dwelling place, one apartment\nwas sacred to His presence. The veil inwrought with cherubim at\nits entrance was not to be lifted by any hand save one. To lift that\nveil, and intrude unbidden into the sacred mystery of the most holy\nplace, was death. For above the mercy seat dwelt the glory of the\nHoliest\u2014glory upon which no man might look and live. On the one\nday of the year appointed for ministry in the most holy place, the\nhigh priest with trembling entered God\u2019s presence, while clouds of\nincense veiled the glory from his sight. Throughout the courts of the\ntemple every sound was hushed. No priests ministered at the altars.[438]\nThe host of worshipers, bowed in silent awe, offered their petitions\nfor God\u2019s mercy.\nDanger in Speculative Knowledge 305\n\u201cThese things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are\nwritten for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are\ncome.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:11.\n\u201cThe Lord is in His holy temple:\nLet all the earth keep silence before Him.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord reigneth; let the people tremble:\nHe sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.\nThe Lord is great in Zion;\nAnd He is high above all the people.\nLet them praise Thy great and terrible name;\nFor it is holy.\u201d\n\u201cThe Lord\u2019s throne is in heaven:\nHis eyes behold, His eyelids try, the children of men.\u201d\n\u201cFrom the height of His sanctuary\u201d \u201cHe hath looked down;\u201d\n\u201cFrom the place of His habitation He looketh\nUpon all the inhabitants of the earth.\nHe fashioneth their hearts alike;\nHe considereth all their works.\u201d\n\u201cLet all the earth fear the Lord:\nLet all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of Him.\u201d\nHabakkuk 2:20; Psalm\n99:1-3; 11:4; 102:19; 33:14,\n15, 8.\nMan cannot by searching find out God. Let none seek with pre-\nsumptuous hand to lift the veil that conceals His glory. \u201cUnsearch-\nable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out.\u201d Romans\n11:33. It is a proof of His mercy that there is the hiding of His power;\nfor to lift the veil that conceals the divine presence is death. No mor-\ntal mind can penetrate the secrecy in which the Mighty One dwells\nand works. Only that which He sees fit to reveal can we comprehend\nof Him. Reason must acknowledge an authority superior to itself.\nHeart and intellect must bow to the great I AM.\nChapter 37\u2014The False and the True in Education[439]\nThe mastermind in the confederacy of evil is ever working to\nkeep out of sight the words of God, and to bring into view the\nopinions of men. He means that we shall not hear the voice of God,\nsaying, \u201cThis is the way, walk ye in it.\u201d Isaiah 30:21. Through\nperverted educational processes he is doing his utmost to obscure\nheaven\u2019s light.\nPhilosophical speculation and scientific research in which God is\nnot acknowledged are making skeptics of thousands. In the schools\nof today the conclusions that learned men have reached as the result\nof their scientific investigations are carefully taught and fully ex-\nplained; while the impression is distinctly given that if these learned\nmen are correct, the Bible cannot be. Skepticism is attractive to the\nhuman mind. The youth see in it an independence that captivates\nthe imagination, and they are deceived. Satan triumphs. He nour-\nishes every seed of doubt that is sown in young hearts. He causes it\nto grow and bear fruit, and soon a plentiful harvest of infidelity is\nreaped.\nIt is because the human heart is inclined to evil that it is so[440]\ndangerous to sow the seeds of skepticism in young minds. Whatever\nweakens faith in God robs the soul of power to resist temptation.\nIt removes the only real safeguard against sin. We are in need of\nschools where the youth shall be taught that greatness consists in\nhonoring God by revealing His character in daily life. Through His\nword and His works we need to learn of God, that our lives may\nfulfill His purpose.\nInfidel Authors\nIn order to obtain an education, many think it essential to study\nthe writings of infidel authors, because these works contain many\nbright gems of thought. But who was the originator of these gems\nof thought? It was God, and God only. He is the source of all light.\n306\nFalse and the True in Education 307\nWhy then should we wade through the mass of error contained in\nthe works of infidels for the sake of a few intellectual truths, when\nall truth is at our command?\nHow is it that men who are at war with the government of God\ncome into possession of the wisdom which they sometimes display?\nSatan himself was educated in the heavenly courts, and he has a\nknowledge of good as well as of evil. He mingles the precious\nwith the vile, and this is what gives him power to deceive. But\nbecause Satan has robed himself in garments of heavenly brightness,\nshall we receive him as an angel of light? The tempter has his\nagents, educated according to his methods, inspired by his spirit,\nand adapted to his work. Shall we co-operate with them? Shall we\nreceive the works of his agents as essential to the acquirement of an\neducation?\nIf the time and effort spent in seeking to grasp the bright ideas\nof infidels were given to studying the precious things of the word of\nGod, thousands who now sit in darkness and in the shadow of death\nwould be rejoicing in the glory of the Light of life.\nHistorical and Theological Lore [441]\nAs a preparation for Christian work, many think it essential\nto acquire an extensive knowledge of historical and theological\nwritings. They suppose that this knowledge will be an aid to them\nin teaching the gospel. But their laborious study of the opinions\nof men tends to the enfeebling of their ministry, rather than to its\nstrengthening. As I see libraries filled with ponderous volumes of\nhistorical and theological lore, I think, Why spend money for that\nwhich is not bread? The sixth chapter of John tells us more than can\nbe found in such works. Christ says: \u201cI am the Bread of Life: he\nthat cometh to Me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on Me\nshall never thirst.\u201d \u201cI am the living Bread which came down from\nheaven: if any man eat of this Bread, he shall live forever.\u201d \u201cHe that\nbelieveth on Me hath everlasting life.\u201d \u201cThe words that I speak unto\nyou, they are spirit, and they are life.\u201d John 6:35, 51, 47, 63.\nThere is a study of history that is not to be condemned. Sacred\nhistory was one of the studies in the schools of the prophets. In\nthe record of His dealings with the nations were traced the foot-\n308 The Ministry of Healing\nsteps of Jehovah. So today we are to consider the dealings of God\nwith the nations of the earth. We are to see in history the fulfill-[442]\nment of prophecy, to study the workings of Providence in the great\nreformatory movements, and to understand the progress of events\nin the marshaling of the nations for the final conflict of the great\ncontroversy.\nSuch study will give broad, comprehensive views of life. It will\nhelp us to understand something of its relations and dependencies,\nhow wonderfully we are bound together in the great brotherhood of\nsociety and nations, and to how great an extent the oppression and\ndegradation of one member means loss to all.\nBut history, as commonly studied, is concerned with man\u2019s\nachievements, his victories in battle, his success in attaining power\nand greatness. God\u2019s agency in the affairs of men is lost sight of.\nFew study the working out of His purpose in the rise and fall of\nnations.\nAnd, to a great degree, theology, as studied and taught, is but\na record of human speculation, serving only to \u201cdarken counsel by\nwords without knowledge.\u201d Too often the motive in accumulating\nthese many books is not so much a desire to obtain food for mind and\nsoul, as it is an ambition to become acquainted with philosophers\nand theologians, a desire to present Christianity to the people in\nlearned terms and propositions.\nNot all the books written can serve the purpose of a holy life.\n\u201c\u2018Learn of Me\u2019,\u201d said the Great Teacher,\u201d \u201c\u2018take My yoke upon you,\u2019\nlearn My meekness and lowliness.\u201d Your intellectual pride will not\naid you in communicating with souls that are perishing for want of\nthe bread of life. In your study of these books you are allowing them\nto take the place of the practical lessons you should be learning from\nChrist. With the results of this study the people are not fed. Very\nlittle of the research which is so wearying to the mind furnishes that[443]\nwhich will help one to be a successful laborer for souls.\nThe Saviour came \u201cto preach the gospel to the poor.\u201d Luke 4:18.\nIn His teaching He used the simplest terms and the plainest symbols.\nAnd it is said that \u201cthe common people heard Him gladly.\u201d Mark\n12:37. Those who are seeking to do His work for this time need a\ndeeper insight into the lessons He has given.\nFalse and the True in Education 309\nThe words of the living God are the highest of all education.\nThose who minister to the people need to eat of the bread of life.\nThis will give them spiritual strength; then they will be prepared to\nminister to all classes of people.\nThe Classics\nIn the colleges and universities thousands of youth devote a large\npart of the best years of life to the study of Greek and Latin. And\nwhile they are engaged in these studies, mind and character are\nmolded by the evil sentiments of pagan literature, the reading of\nwhich is generally regarded as an essential part of the study of these\nlanguages.\nThose who are conversant with the classics declare that \u201cthe\nGreek tragedies are full of incest, murder, and human sacrifices to\nlustful and revengeful gods.\u201d Far better would it be for the world\nwere the education gained from such sources to be dispensed with.\n\u201cCan one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?\u201d Proverbs\n6:28. \u201cWho can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.\u201d Job\n14:4. Can we then expect the youth to develop Christian character\nwhile their education is molded by the teaching of those who set at\ndefiance the principles of the law of God?\nIn casting off restraint and plunging into reckless amusement, [444]\ndissipation, and vice, students are but imitating that which is kept\nbefore their minds by these studies. There are callings in which a\nknowledge of Greek and Latin is needed. Some must study these\nlanguages. But the knowledge of them essential for practical uses\nmight be gained without a study of literature that is corrupt and\ncorrupting.\nAnd a knowledge of Greek and Latin is not needed by many.\nThe study of dead languages should be made secondary to a study of\nthose subjects that teach the right use of all the powers of body and\nmind. It is folly for students to devote their time to the acquirement\nof dead languages or of book knowledge in any line, to the neglect\nof a training for life\u2019s practical duties.\nWhat do students carry with them when they leave school?\nWhere are they going? What are they to do? Have they the knowl-\nedge that will enable them to teach others? Have they been educated\n310 The Ministry of Healing\nto be true fathers and mothers? Can they stand at the head of a family\nas wise instructors? The only education worthy of the name is that\nwhich leads young men and young women to be Christlike, which\nfits them to bear life\u2019s responsibilities, fits them to stand at the head\nof their families. Such an education is not to be acquired by a study\nof heathen classics.\nSensational Literature\nMany of the popular publications of the day are filled with sensa-\ntional stories that are educating the youth in wickedness and leading\nthem in the path to perdition. Mere children in years are old in a\nknowledge of crime. They are incited to evil by the tales they read.\nIn imagination they act over the deeds portrayed, until their ambition\nis aroused to see what they can do in committing crime and evading\npunishment.\nTo the active minds of children and youth the scenes pictured[445]\nin imaginary revelations of the future are realities. As revolutions\nare predicted and all manner of proceedings described that break\ndown the barriers of law and self-restraint, many catch the spirit of\nthese representations. They are led to the commission of crimes even\nworse, if possible, than these sensational writers depict. Through\nsuch influences as these, society is becoming demoralized. The\nseeds of lawlessness are sown broadcast. None need marvel that a\nharvest of crime is the result.\nWorks of romance, frivolous, exciting tales, are, in hardly less\ndegree, a curse to the reader. The author may profess to teach a moral\nlesson, throughout his work he may interweave religious sentiments;\nbut often these serve only to veil the folly and worthlessness beneath.\nThe world is flooded with books that are filled with enticing\nerror. The youth receive as truth that which the Bible denounces as\nfalsehood, and they love and cling to deception that means ruin to\nthe soul.\nThere are works of fiction that were written for the purpose of\nteaching truth or exposing some great evil. Some of these works\nhave accomplished good. Yet they have also wrought untold harm.\nThey contain statements and highly wrought pen pictures that excite\nthe imagination and give rise to a train of thought which is full\nFalse and the True in Education 311\nof danger, especially to the youth. The scenes described are lived\nover and over again in their thoughts. Such reading unfits the mind\nfor usefulness and disqualifies it for spiritual exercise. It destroys\ninterest in the Bible. Heavenly things find little place in the thoughts.\nAs the mind dwells upon the scenes of impurity portrayed, passion\nis aroused, and the end is sin.\nEven fiction which contains no suggestion of impurity, and which\nmay be intended to teach excellent principles, is harmful. It en- [446]\ncourages the habit of hasty and superficial reading merely for the\nstory. Thus it tends to destroy the power of connected and vigorous\nthought; it unfits the soul to contemplate the great problems of duty\nand destiny.\nBy fostering love for mere amusement, the reading of fiction\ncreates a distaste for life\u2019s practical duties. Through its exciting,\nintoxicating power it is not infrequently a cause of both mental\nand physical disease. Many a miserable, neglected home, many a\nlifelong invalid, many an inmate of the insane asylum, has become\nsuch through the habit of novel reading.\nIt is often urged that in order to win the youth from sensational\nor worthless literature, we should supply them with a better class\nof fiction. This is like trying to cure the drunkard by giving him, in\nthe place of whisky or brandy, the milder intoxicants, such as wine,\nbeer, or cider. The use of these would continually foster the appetite\nfor stronger stimulants. The only safety for the inebriate, and the\nonly safeguard for the temperate man, is total abstinence. For the\nlover of fiction the same rule holds true. Total abstinence is his only\nsafety.\nMyths and Fairy Tales\nIn the education of children and youth, fairy tales, myths, and\nfictitious stories are now given a large place. Books of this character\nare used in the schools, and they are to be found in many homes.\nHow can Christian parents permit their children to use books so\nfilled with falsehood? When the children ask the meaning of stories\nso contrary to the teaching of their parents, the answer is that the\nstories are not true; but this does not do away with the evil results of\ntheir use. The ideas presented in these books mislead the children.\n312 The Ministry of Healing\nThey impart false views of life and beget and foster a desire for the[447]\nunreal.\nThe widespread use of such books at this time is one of the\ncunning devices of Satan. He is seeking to divert the minds of old\nand young from the great work of character building. He means that\nour children and youth shall be swept away by the soul-destroying\ndeceptions with which he is filling the world. Therefore he seeks to\ndivert their minds from the word of God and thus prevent them from\nobtaining a knowledge of those truths that would be their safeguard.\nNever should books containing a perversion of truth be placed\nin the hands of children or youth. Let not our children, in the very\nprocess of obtaining an education, receive ideas that will prove to be\nseeds of sin. If those with mature minds had nothing to do with such\nbooks, they would themselves be far safer, and their example and\ninfluence on the right side would make it far less difficult to guard\nthe youth from temptation.\nWe have an abundance of that which is real, that which is divine.\nThose who thirst for knowledge need not go to polluted fountains.\nThe Lord says:\n\u201cBow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise,\nAnd apply thine heart unto My knowledge....\nThat thy trust may be in the Lord,\nI have made known to thee this day, even to thee.\nHave not I written to thee excellent things\nIn counsels and knowledge,\nThat I might make thee know the certainty of the words of\ntruth;\nThat thou mightest answer the words of truth to them\nthat send unto thee?\u201d\n\u201cHe established a testimony in Jacob,\nAnd appointed a law in Israel,\nWhich He commanded our fathers, [448]\nThat they should make them known to their children;\u201d\n\u201cShowing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,\nAnd His strength, and His wonderful works that He hath\ndone.\u201d\nFalse and the True in Education 313\n\u201cThat the generation to come might know them,\nEven the children which should be born;\nWho should arise and declare them to their children:\nThat they might set their hope in God.\u201d\n\u201cThe blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich,\nAnd He addeth no sorrow with it.\u201d\nProverbs 22:17-21; Psalm\n78:5, 4, 6, 7; Proverbs 10:22.\nChrist\u2019s Teaching\nSo also Christ presented the principles of truth in the gospel.\nIn His teaching we may drink of the pure streams that flow from\nthe throne of God. Christ could have imparted to men knowledge\nthat would have surpassed any previous disclosures, and put in the\nbackground every other discovery. He could have unlocked mystery\nafter mystery, and could have concentrated around these wonderful\nrevelations the active, earnest thought of successive generations till\nthe close of time. But He would not spare a moment from teaching\nthe science of salvation. His time, His faculties, and His life were\nappreciated and used only as the means for working out the salvation\nof the souls of men. He had come to seek and to save that which\nwas lost, and He would not be turned from His purpose. He allowed\nnothing to divert Him.\nChrist imparted only that knowledge which could be utilized.\nHis instruction of the people was confined to the needs of their own\ncondition in practical life. The curiosity that led them to come to\nHim with prying questions, He did not gratify. All such questionings\nHe made the occasion for solemn, earnest, vital appeals. To those [449]\nwho were so eager to pluck from the tree of knowledge, He offered\nthe fruit of the tree of life. They found every avenue closed except\nthe way that leads to God. Every fountain was sealed save the\nfountain of eternal life.\nOur Saviour did not encourage any to attend the rabbinical\nschools of His day, for the reason that their minds would be cor-\nrupted with the continually repeated, \u201cThey say,\u201d or, \u201cIt has been\nsaid.\u201d Why, then, should we accept the unstable words of men as ex-\nalted wisdom, when a greater, a certain, wisdom is at our command?\n314 The Ministry of Healing\nThat which I have seen of eternal things, and that which I have\nseen of the weakness of humanity, has deeply impressed my mind\nand influenced my lifework. I see nothing wherein man should be\npraised or glorified. I see no reason why the opinions of worldly-wise\nmen and so-called great men should be trusted in and exalted. How\ncan those who are destitute of divine enlightenment have correct\nideas of God\u2019s plans and ways? They either deny Him altogether\nand ignore His existence, or they circumscribe His power by their\nown finite conceptions.\nLet us choose to be taught by Him who created the heavens and\nthe earth, by Him who set the stars in their order in the firmament\nand appointed the sun and the moon to do their work.\nIt is right for the youth to feel that they must reach the highest\ndevelopment of their mental powers. We would not restrict the\neducation to which God has set no limit. But our attainments avail\nnothing if not put to use for the honor of God and the good of\nhumanity.\nIt is not well to crowd the mind with studies that require intense\napplication, but that are not brought into use in practical life. Such[450]\neducation will be a loss to the student. For these studies lessen his\ndesire and inclination for the studies that would fit him for usefulness\nand enable him to fulfill his responsibilities. A practical training is\nworth far more than any amount of mere theorizing. It is not enough\neven to have knowledge. We must have ability to use the knowledge\naright.\nThe time, means, and study that so many expend for a compara-\ntively useless education should be devoted to gaining an education\nthat would make them practical men and women, fitted to bear life\u2019s\nresponsibilities. Such an education would be of the highest value.\nWhat we need is knowledge that will strengthen mind and soul,\nthat will make us better men and women. Heart education is of far\nmore importance than mere book learning. It is well, even essential,\nto have a knowledge of the world in which we live; but if we leave\neternity out of our reckoning, we shall make a failure from which\nwe can never recover.\nA student may devote all his powers to acquiring knowledge;\nbut unless he has a knowledge of God, unless he obeys the laws that\ngovern his own being, he will destroy himself. By wrong habits, he\nFalse and the True in Education 315\nloses the power of self-appreciation; he loses self-control. He cannot\nreason correctly about matters that concern him most deeply. He is\nreckless and irrational in his treatment of mind and body. Through\nhis neglect to cultivate right principles, he is ruined both for this\nworld and for the world to come.\nIf the youth understood their own weakness, they would find in\nGod their strength. If they seek to be taught by Him they will become\nwise in His wisdom, and their lives will be fruitful of blessing to\nthe world. But if they give up their minds to mere worldly and\nspeculative study, and thus separate from God, they will lose all that\nenriches life.\nChapter 38\u2014The Importance of Seeking True[451]\nKnowledge\nMore clearly than we do we need to understand the issues at\nstake in the great conflict in which we are engaged. We need to\nunderstand more fully the value of the truths of the word of God and\nthe danger of allowing our minds to be diverted from them by the\ngreat deceiver.\nThe infinite value of the sacrifice required for our redemption\nreveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil. Through sin the whole\nhuman organism is deranged, the mind is perverted, the imagination\ncorrupted. Sin has degraded the faculties of the soul. Temptations\nfrom without find an answering chord within the heart, and the feet\nturn imperceptibly toward evil.\nAs the sacrifice in our behalf was complete, so our restoration\nfrom the defilement of sin is to be complete. No act of wickedness\nwill the law of God excuse; no unrighteousness can escape its con-\ndemnation. The ethics of the gospel acknowledge no standard but\nthe perfection of the divine character. The life of Christ was a perfect\nfulfillment of every precept of the law. He said, \u201cI have kept My\nFather\u2019s commandments.\u201d His life is our example of obedience and[452]\nservice. God alone can renew the heart. \u201cIt is God which worketh in\nyou both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d But we are bidden,\n\u201cWork out your own salvation.\u201d John 15:10; Philippians 2:13, 12.\nThe Work That Requires Our Thought\nWrongs cannot be righted, nor can reformations in conduct be\nmade by a few feeble, intermittent efforts. Character building is the\nwork, not of a day, nor of a year, but of a lifetime. The struggle\nfor conquest over self, for holiness and heaven, is a lifelong strug-\ngle. Without continual effort and constant activity, there can be no\nadvancement in the divine life, no attainment of the victor\u2019s crown.\n316\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 317\nThe strongest evidence of man\u2019s fall from a higher state is the\nfact that it costs so much to return. The way of return can be gained\nonly by hard fighting, inch by inch, hour by hour. In one moment, by\na hasty, unguarded act, we may place ourselves in the power of evil;\nbut it requires more than a moment to break the fetters and attain to\na holier life. The purpose may be formed, the work begun; but its\naccomplishment will require toil, time, perseverance, patience, and\nsacrifice.\nWe cannot allow ourselves to act from impulse. We cannot be\noff guard for a moment. Beset with temptations without number, we\nmust resist firmly or be conquered. Should we come to the close of\nlife with our work undone, it would be an eternal loss.\nThe life of the apostle Paul was a constant conflict with self. He\nsaid, \u201cI die daily.\u201d 1 Corinthians 15:31. His will and his desires every\nday conflicted with duty and the will of God. Instead of following [453]\ninclination, he did God\u2019s will, however crucifying to his nature.\nAt the close of his life of conflict, looking back over its struggles\nand triumphs, he could say, \u201cI have fought a good fight, I have\nfinished my course, I have kept the faith: henceforth there is laid\nup for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous\nJudge, shall give me at that day.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:7, 8.\nThe Christian life is a battle and a march. In this warfare there is\nno release; the effort must be continuous and persevering. It is by\nunceasing endeavor that we maintain the victory over the temptations\nof Satan. Christian integrity must be sought with resistless energy\nand maintained with a resolute fixedness of purpose.\nNo one will be borne upward without stern, persevering effort in\nhis own behalf. All must engage in this warfare for themselves; no\none else can fight our battles. Individually we are responsible for the\nissues of the struggle; though Noah, Job, and Daniel were in the land\nthey could deliver neither son nor daughter by their righteousness.\nThe Science to Be Mastered\nThere is a science of Christianity to be mastered\u2014a science as\nmuch deeper, broader, higher than any human science as the heavens\nare higher than the earth. The mind is to be disciplined, educated,\ntrained; for we are to do service for God in ways that are not in har-\n318 The Ministry of Healing\nmony with inborn inclination. Hereditary and cultivated tendencies\nto evil must be overcome. Often the education and training of a\nlifetime must be discarded, that one may become a learner in the\nschool of Christ. Our hearts must be educated to become steadfast\nin God. We are to form habits of thought that will enable us to[454]\nresist temptation. We must learn to look upward. The principles of\nthe word of God\u2014principles that are as high as heaven, and that\ncompass eternity\u2014we are to understand in their bearing upon our\ndaily life. Every act, every word, every thought, is to be in accord\nwith these principles. All must be brought into harmony with, and\nsubject to, Christ.\nThe precious graces of the Holy Spirit are not developed in a\nmoment. Courage, fortitude, meekness, faith, unwavering trust in\nGod\u2019s power to save, are acquired by the experience of years. By a\nlife of holy endeavor and firm adherence to the right the children of\nGod are to seal their destiny.\nNo Time to Lose\nWe have no time to lose. We know not how soon our probation\nmay close. At the longest, we have but a brief lifetime here, and we\nknow not how soon the arrow of death may strike our hearts. We\nknow not how soon we may be called to give up the world and all\nits interests. Eternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be\nlifted. But a few short years, and for everyone now numbered with\nthe living the mandate will go forth:\n\u201cHe that is unjust, let him be unjust still: ... and he that is\nrighteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be\nholy still.\u201d Revelation 22:11.\nAre we prepared? Have we become acquainted with God, the\nGovernor of heaven, the Lawgiver, and with Jesus Christ whom He\nsent into the world as His representative? When our lifework is\nended, shall we be able to say, as did Christ our example:\n\u201cI have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the work\nwhich Thou gavest Me to do.... I have manifested Thy name\u201d? John\n17:4-6.\nThe angels of God are seeking to attract us from ourselves and\nfrom earthly things. Let them not labor in vain.\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 319\nMinds that have been given up to loose thought need to change. [455]\n\u201cGird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for\nthe grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus\nChrist; as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to\nthe former lusts in your ignorance: but as He which hath called you\nis holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; because it is\nwritten, Be ye holy; for I am holy.\u201d 1 Peter 1:13-16.\nThe thoughts must be centered upon God. We must put forth\nearnest effort to overcome the evil tendencies of the natural heart.\nOur efforts, our self-denial and perseverance, must be proportionate\nto the infinite value of the object of which we are in pursuit. Only\nby overcoming as Christ overcame shall we win the crown of life.\nThe Need of Self-Renunciation\nMan\u2019s great danger is in being self-deceived, indulging self-\nsufficiency, and thus separating from God, the source of his strength.\nOur natural tendencies, unless corrected by the Holy Spirit of God,\nhave in them the seeds of moral death. Unless we become vitally\nconnected with God, we cannot resist the unhallowed effects of\nself-indulgence, self-love, and temptation to sin.\nIn order to receive help from Christ, we must realize our need.\nWe must have a true knowledge of ourselves. It is only he who\nknows himself to be a sinner that Christ can save. Only as we see\nour utter helplessness and renounce all self-trust, shall we lay hold\non divine power.\nIt is not only at the beginning of the Christian life that this\nrenunciation of self is to be made. At every advance step heavenward\nit is to be renewed. All our good works are dependent on a power\noutside of ourselves; therefore there needs to be a continual reaching\nout of the heart after God, a constant, earnest confession of sin and\nhumbling of the soul before Him. Perils surround us; and we are\nsafe only as we feel our weakness and cling with the grasp of faith [456]\nto our mighty Deliverer.\n320 The Ministry of Healing\nChrist the Fountainhead of True Knowledge\nWe must turn away from a thousand topics that invite attention.\nThere are matters that consume time and arouse inquiry, but end in\nnothing. The highest interests demand the close attention and energy\nthat are so often given to comparatively insignificant things.\nAccepting new theories does not in itself bring new life to the\nsoul. Even an acquaintance with facts and theories important in\nthemselves is of little value unless put to a practical use. We need to\nfeel our responsibility to give our souls food that will nourish and\nstimulate spiritual life.\n\u201cIncline thine ear unto wisdom, ...\nApply thy heart to understanding; ...\nSeek her as silver, ...\nSearch for her for hid treasures:\nThen shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah,\nAnd find the knowledge of God....\nThen shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,\nAnd equity, yea, every good path.\nFor wisdom shall enter into thy heart,\nAnd knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;\nDiscretion shall watch over thee;\nUnderstanding shall keep thee.\u201d\nWisdom \u201cis a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:\nAnd happy is everyone that retaineth her.\u201d\nProverbs 2:2-11, A.R.V .;\n3:18.\nThe question for us to study is, \u201cWhat is truth\u2014the truth that\nis to be cherished, loved, honored, and obeyed?\u201d The devotees of\nscience have been defeated and disheartened in their efforts to find\nout God. What they need to inquire at this time is, \u201cWhat is the truth\nthat will enable us to win the salvation of our souls?\u201d\n\u201cWhat think ye of Christ?\u201d\u2014this is the all-important question.[457]\nDo you receive Him as a personal Saviour? To all who receive Him\nHe gives power to become sons of God.\nChrist revealed God to His disciples in a way that performed in\ntheir hearts a special work, such as He desires to do in our hearts.\nImportance of Seeking True Knowledge 321\nThere are many who, in dwelling too largely upon theory, have lost\nsight of the living power of the Saviour\u2019s example. They have lost\nsight of Him as the humble, self-denying worker. What they need is\nto behold Jesus. Daily we need the fresh revealing of His presence.\nWe need to follow more closely His example of self-renunciation\nand self-sacrifice.\nWe need the experience that Paul had when he wrote: \u201cI am\ncrucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth\nin me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of\nthe Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.\u201d Galatians\n2:20.\nThe knowledge of God and of Jesus Christ expressed in character\nis an exaltation above everything else that is esteemed on earth or in\nheaven. It is the very highest education. It is the key that opens the\nportals of the heavenly city. This knowledge it is God\u2019s purpose that\nall who put on Christ shall possess.\nChapter 39\u2014The Knowledge Received Through[458]\nGod\u2019s Word\nThe whole Bible is a revelation of the glory of God in Christ.\nReceived, believed, obeyed, it is the great instrumentality in the\ntransformation of character. It is the grand stimulus, the constraining\nforce, that quickens the physical, mental, and spiritual powers, and\ndirects the life into right channels.\nThe reason why the youth, and even those of mature years, are\nso easily led into temptation and sin, is that they do not study the\nword of God and meditate upon it as they should. The lack of firm,\ndecided will power, which is manifest in life and character, results\nfrom neglect of the sacred instruction of God\u2019s word. They do not by\nearnest effort direct the mind to that which would inspire pure, holy\nthought and divert it from that which is impure and untrue. There\nare few who choose the better part, who sit at the feet of Jesus, as\ndid Mary, to learn of the divine Teacher. Few treasure His words in\nthe heart and practice them in the life.\nThe truths of the Bible, received, will uplift mind and soul. If[459]\nthe word of God were appreciated as it should be, both young and\nold would possess an inward rectitude, a strength of principle, that\nwould enable them to resist temptation.\nLet men teach and write the precious things of the Holy Scrip-\ntures. Let the thought, the aptitude, the keen exercise of brain power,\nbe given to the study of the thoughts of God. Study not the philoso-\nphy of man\u2019s conjectures, but study the philosophy of Him who is[460]\ntruth. No other literature can compare with this in value.\nThe mind that is earthly finds no pleasure in contemplating the\nword of God; but for the mind renewed by the Holy Spirit, divine\nbeauty and celestial light shine from the sacred page. That which\nto the earthly mind was a desolate wilderness, to the spiritual mind\nbecomes a land of living streams.\nThe knowledge of God as revealed in His word is the knowledge\nto be given to our children. From the earliest dawn of reason they\n322\nKnowledge Received Through God\u2019s Word 323\nshould be made familiar with the name and the life of Jesus. Their\nfirst lessons should teach them that God is their Father. Their first\ntraining should be that of loving obedience. Reverently and tenderly\nlet the word of God be read and repeated to them in portions suited\nto their comprehension and adapted to awaken their interest. And,\nabove all, let them learn of His love revealed in Christ, and its great\nlesson:\n\u201cIf God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.\u201d 1 John\n4:11.\nLet the youth make the word of God the food of mind and soul.\nLet the cross of Christ be made the science of all education, the\ncenter of all teaching and all study. Let it be brought into the daily\nexperience in practical life. So will the Saviour become to the youth\na daily companion and friend. Every thought will be brought into\ncaptivity to the obedience of Christ. With the apostle Paul they will\nbe able to say:\n\u201cGod forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord\nJesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the\nworld.\u201d Galatians 6:14.\nThus through faith they come to know God by an experimental [461]\nknowledge. They have proved for themselves the reality of His word,\nthe truth of His promises. They have tasted, and they know that the\nLord is good.\nThe beloved John had a knowledge gained through his own\nexperience. He could testify:\n\u201cThat which was from the beginning, which we have heard,\nwhich we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon,\nand our hands have handled, of the Word of life; (for the life was\nmanifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto\nyou that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested\nunto us;) that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you,\nthat ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship\nis with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 John 1:1-3.\nSo everyone may be able, through his own experience, to \u201cset\nhis seal to this, that God is true.\u201d John 3:33, A.R.V . He can bear\nwitness to that which he himself has seen and heard and felt of the\npower of Christ. He can testify:\n324 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cI needed help, and I found it in Jesus. Every want was supplied,\nthe hunger of my soul was satisfied; the Bible is to me the revelation\nof Christ. I believe in Jesus because He is to me a divine Saviour. I\nbelieve the Bible because I have found it to be the voice of God to\nmy soul.\u201d\nHe who has gained a knowledge of God and His word through\npersonal experience is prepared to engage in the study of natural\nscience. Of Christ it is written, \u201cIn Him was life; and the life was the\nlight of men.\u201d John 1:4. Before the entrance of sin, Adam and Eve\nin Eden were surrounded with a clear and beautiful light, the light\nof God. This light illuminated everything which they approached.\nThere was nothing to obscure their perception of the character or\nthe works of God. But when they yielded to the tempter, the light[462]\ndeparted from them. In losing the garments of holiness, they lost the\nlight that had illuminated nature. No longer could they read it aright.\nThey could not discern the character of God in His works. So today\nman cannot of himself read aright the teaching of nature. Unless\nguided by divine wisdom, he exalts nature and the laws of nature\nabove nature\u2019s God. This is why mere human ideas in regard to\nscience so often contradict the teaching of God\u2019s word. But for those\nwho receive the light of the life of Christ, nature is again illuminated.\nIn the light shining from the cross, we can rightly interpret nature\u2019s\nteaching.\nHe who has a knowledge of God and His word through personal\nexperience has a settled faith in the divinity of the Holy Scriptures.\nHe has proved that God\u2019s word is truth, and he knows that truth can\nnever contradict itself. He does not test the Bible by men\u2019s ideas of\nscience; he brings these ideas to the test of the unerring standard.\nHe knows that in true science there can be nothing contrary to the\nteaching of the word; since both have the same Author, a correct\nunderstanding of both will prove them to be in harmony. Whatever\nin so-called scientific teaching contradicts the testimony of God\u2019s\nword is mere human guesswork.\nTo such a student, scientific research will open vast fields of\nthought and information. As he contemplates the things of nature,\na new perception of truth comes to him. The book of nature and\nthe written word shed light upon each other. Both make him better\nKnowledge Received Through God\u2019s Word 325\nacquainted with God by teaching him of His character and of the\nlaws through which He works.\nThe experience of the psalmist is the experience that all may\ngain by receiving God\u2019s word through nature and through revelation.\nHe says:\n\u201cThou, Lord, hast made me glad through Thy work: [463]\nI will triumph in the works of Thy hands.\u201d\n\u201cThy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens;\nAnd Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.\nThy righteousness is like the great mountains;\nThy judgments are a great deep....\n\u201cHow excellent is Thy loving-kindness, O God!\u201d\n\u201cThe children of men take refuge under the\nshadow of Thy wings....\nAnd Thou wilt make them drink of the river of\nThy pleasures.\nFor with Thee is the fountain of life:\nIn Thy light shall we see light.\u201d\n\u201cBlessed are they that are upright in way,\nWho walk in the law of Jehovah.\nBlessed are they that keep His testimonies,\nThat seek Him with the whole heart.\u201d\n\u201cWherewith shall a young man cleanse his way?\nBy taking heed thereto according to Thy word.\u201d\n\u201cI have chosen the way of faithfulness:\nThine ordinances have I set before Me.\u201d\n\u201cThy word have I laid up in my heart,\nThat I might not sin against Thee.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I shall walk at liberty;\nFor I have sought Thy precepts.\u201d\n\u201cOpen Thou mine eyes, that I may behold\nWondrous things out of Thy law.\u201d\n\u201cThy testimonies also are my delight\nAnd my counselors.\u201d\n326 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cThe law of Thy mouth is better unto me\nThan thousands of gold and silver.\u201d\n\u201cOh how love I Thy law!\nIt is my meditation all the day.\u201d\n\u201cThy testimonies are wonderful;\nTherefore doth my soul keep them.\u201d\n\u201cThy statutes have been my songs\nIn the house of my pilgrimage.\u201d\n\u201cThy word is very pure;\nTherefore Thy servant loveth it.\u201d\n\u201cThe sum of Thy word is truth; [464]\nAnd every one of Thy righteous ordinances endureth forever.\u201d\n\u201cLet my soul live, and it shall praise Thee;\nAnd let Thine ordinances help me.\u201d\n\u201cGreat peace have they that love Thy law;\nAnd they have no occasion of stumbling.\n\u201cI have hoped for Thy salvation, O Jehovah,\nAnd have done Thy commandments.\nMy soul hath observed Thy testimonies;\nAnd I love them exceedingly.\u201d\n\u201cThe opening of Thy words giveth light;\nIt giveth understanding unto the simple.\u201d\n\u201cThy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies;\nFor they are ever with me.\nI have more understanding than all my teachers;\nFor Thy testimonies are my meditation.\nI understand more than the aged,\nBecause I have kept Thy precepts.\u201d\n\u201cThrough Thy precepts I get understanding:\nTherefore I hate every false way.\u201d\nKnowledge Received Through God\u2019s Word 327\n\u201cThy testimonies have I taken as a heritage forever;\nFor they are the rejoicing of my heart.\u201d\nPsalm 92:4; 36:5-7; 36:7-9,",

      "text": "Clearer Revealings of God\nIt is our privilege to reach higher and still higher for clearer\nrevealings of the character of God. When Moses prayed, \u201cI beseech\nThee, show me Thy glory,\u201d the Lord did not rebuke him, but He\ngranted his prayer. God declared to His servant, \u201cI will make all My\ngoodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord\nbefore thee.\u201d Exodus 33:18, 19.\nIt is sin that darkens our minds and dims our perceptions. As sin\nis purged from our hearts, the light of the knowledge of the glory of [465]\nGod in the face of Jesus Christ, illuminating His word and reflected\nfrom the face of nature, more and more fully will declare Him\n\u201cmerciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness\nand truth.\u201d Exodus 34:6.\nIn His light shall we see light, until mind and heart and soul are\ntransformed into the image of His holiness.\nFor those who thus lay hold of the divine assurances of God\u2019s\nword, there are wonderful possibilities. Before them lie vast fields\nof truth, vast resources of power. Glorious things are to be revealed.\nPrivileges and duties which they do not even suspect to be in the\nBible will be made manifest. All who walk in the path of humble\nobedience, fulfilling His purpose, will know more and more of the\noracles of God.\nLet the student take the Bible as his guide and stand firm for\nprinciple, and he may aspire to any height of attainment. All the\nphilosophies of human nature have led to confusion and shame when\nGod has not been recognized as all in all. But the precious faith\ninspired of God imparts strength and nobility of character. As His\ngoodness, His mercy, and His love are dwelt upon, clearer and still\n328 The Ministry of Healing\nclearer will be the perception of truth; higher, holier, the desire for[466]\npurity of heart and clearness of thought. The soul dwelling in the\npure atmosphere of holy thought is transformed by intercourse with\nGod through the study of His word. Truth is so large, so far-reaching,\nso deep, so broad, that self is lost sight of. The heart is softened and\nsubdued into humility, kindness, and love.\nAnd the natural powers are enlarged because of holy obedience.\nFrom the study of the word of life, students may come forth with\nminds expanded, elevated, ennobled. If they are, like Daniel, hearers\nand doers of the word of God, they may advance as he did in all\nbranches of learning. Being pure-minded, they will become strong-\nminded. Every intellectual faculty will be quickened. They may\nso educate and discipline themselves that all within the sphere of\ntheir influence shall see what man can be, and what he can do, when\nconnected with the God of wisdom and power.\nEducation in the Life Eternal\nOur lifework here is a preparation for the life eternal. The edu-\ncation begun here will not be completed in this life; it will be going\nforward through all eternity\u2014ever progressing, never completed.\nMore and more fully will be revealed the wisdom and love of God in\nthe plan of redemption. The Saviour, as He leads His children to the\nfountains of living waters, will impart rich stores of knowledge. And\nday by day the wonderful works of God, the evidences of His power\nin creating and sustaining the universe, will open before the mind\nin new beauty. In the light that shines from the throne, mysteries\nwill disappear, and the soul will be filled with astonishment at the\nsimplicity of the things that were never before comprehended.\nNow we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face; now\nwe know in part; but then we shall know even as also we are known.\nThe Worker\u2019s Need [467]\nChapter 40\u2014Help in Daily Living[468]\n[469]\nThere is an eloquence far more powerful than the eloquence of\nwords in the quiet, consistent life of a pure, true Christian. What a\nman is has more influence than what he says.\nThe officers who were sent to Jesus came back with the report\nthat never man spoke as He spoke. But the reason for this was that\nnever man lived as He lived. Had His life been other than it was,\nHe could not have spoken as He did. His words bore with them a\nconvincing power, because they came from a heart pure and holy,\nfull of love and sympathy, benevolence and truth.\nIt is our own character and experience that determine our in-\nfluence upon others. In order to convince others of the power of\nChrist\u2019s grace, we must know its power in our own hearts and lives.\nThe gospel we present for the saving of souls must be the gospel by\nwhich our own souls are saved. Only through a living faith in Christ\nas a personal Saviour is it possible to make our influence felt in a\nskeptical world. If we would draw sinners out of the swift-running\ncurrent, our own feet must be firmly set upon the Rock, Christ Jesus.[470]\nThe badge of Christianity is not an outward sign, not the wearing\nof a cross or a crown, but it is that which reveals the union of man\nwith God. By the power of His grace manifested in the transfor-\nmation of character the world is to be convinced that God has sent\nHis Son as its Redeemer. No other influence that can surround the\nhuman soul has such power as the influence of an unselfish life. The\nstrongest argument in favor of the gospel is a loving and lovable\nChristian.\nThe Discipline of Trial\nTo live such a life, to exert such an influence, costs at every step\neffort, self-sacrifice, discipline. It is because they do not understand\nthis that many are so easily discouraged in the Christian life. Many\nwho sincerely consecrate their lives to God\u2019s service are surprised\n330\nHelp in Daily Living 331\nand disappointed to find themselves, as never before, confronted\nby obstacles and beset by trials and perplexities. They pray for\nChristlikeness of character, for a fitness for the Lord\u2019s work, and\nthey are placed in circumstances that seem to call forth all the evil of\ntheir nature. Faults are revealed of which they did not even suspect\nthe existence. Like Israel of old they question, \u201cIf God is leading us,\nwhy do all these things come upon us?\u201d\nIt is because God is leading them that these things come upon [471]\nthem. Trials and obstacles are the Lord\u2019s chosen methods of disci-\npline and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads the\nhearts of men knows their characters better than they themselves\nknow them. He sees that some have powers and susceptibilities\nwhich, rightly directed, might be used in the advancement of His\nwork. In His providence He brings these persons into different\npositions and varied circumstances that they may discover in their\ncharacter the defects which have been concealed from their own\nknowledge. He gives them opportunity to correct these defects and\nto fit themselves for His service. Often He permits the fires of\naffliction to assail them that they may be purified.\nThe fact that we are called upon to endure trial shows that the\nLord Jesus sees in us something precious which He desires to de-\nvelop. If He saw in us nothing whereby He might glorify His name,\nHe would not spend time in refining us. He does not cast worthless\nstones into His furnace. It is valuable ore that He refines. The black-\nsmith puts the iron and steel into the fire that he may know what\nmanner of metal they are. The Lord allows His chosen ones to be\nplaced in the furnace of affliction to prove what temper they are of\nand whether they can be fashioned for His work.\nThe potter takes the clay and molds it according to his will. He\nkneads it and works it. He tears it apart and presses it together. He\nwets it and then dries it. He lets it lie for a while without touching it.\nWhen it is perfectly pliable, he continues the work of making of it a [472]\nvessel. He forms it into shape and on the wheel trims and polishes\nit. He dries it in the sun and bakes it in the oven. Thus it becomes a\nvessel fit for use. So the great Master Worker desires to mold and\nfashion us. And as the clay is in the hands of the potter, so are we to\nbe in His hands. We are not to try to do the work of the potter. Our\npart is to yield ourselves to be molded by the Master Worker.\n332 The Ministry of Healing\n\u201cBeloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which\nis to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but\nrejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings; that,\nwhen His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding\njoy.\u201d 1 Peter 4:12, 13.\nIn the full light of day, and in hearing of the music of other\nvoices, the caged bird will not sing the song that his master seeks\nto teach him. He learns a snatch of this, a trill of that, but never\na separate and entire melody. But the master covers the cage, and\nplaces it where the bird will listen to the one song he is to sing. In\nthe dark, he tries and tries again to sing that song until it is learned,\nand he breaks forth in perfect melody. Then the bird is brought forth,\nand ever after he can sing that song in the light. Thus God deals with\nHis children. He has a song to teach us, and when we have learned\nit amid the shadows of affliction we can sing it ever afterward.\nMany are dissatisfied with their lifework. It may be that their sur-\nroundings are uncongenial; their time is occupied with commonplace\nwork, when they think themselves capable of higher responsibilities;\noften their efforts seem to them to be unappreciated or fruitless; their\nfuture is uncertain.\nLet us remember that while the work we have to do may not\nbe our choice, it is to be accepted as God\u2019s choice for us. Whether[473]\npleasing or unpleasing, we are to do the duty that lies nearest. \u201cWhat-\nsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no\nwork, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither\nthou goest.\u201d Ecclesiastes 9:10.\nIf the Lord desires us to bear a message to Nineveh, it will not\nbe as pleasing to Him for us to go to Joppa or to Capernaum. He\nhas reasons for sending us to the place toward which our feet have\nbeen directed. At that very place there may be someone in need of\nthe help we can give. He who sent Philip to the Ethiopian councilor,\nPeter to the Roman centurion, and the little Israelitish maiden to\nthe help of Naaman, the Syrian captain, sends men and women and\nyouth today as His representatives to those in need of divine help\nand guidance.\nHelp in Daily Living 333\nGod\u2019s Plans the Best\nOur plans are not always God\u2019s plans. He may see that it is best\nfor us and for His cause to refuse our very best intentions, as He did\nin the case of David. But of one thing we may be assured, He will\nbless and use in the advancement of His cause those who sincerely\ndevote themselves and all they have to His glory. If He sees it best\nnot to grant their desires He will counterbalance the refusal by giving\nthem tokens of His love and entrusting to them another service.\nIn His loving care and interest for us, often He who understands\nus better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit us selfishly\nto seek the gratification of our own ambition. He does not permit us\nto pass by the homely but sacred duties that lie next us. Often these\nduties afford the very training essential to prepare us for a higher\nwork. Often our plans fail that God\u2019s plans for us may succeed.\nWe are never called upon to make a real sacrifice for God. Many\nthings He asks us to yield to Him, but in doing this we are but giving\nup that which hinders us in the heavenward way. Even when called\nupon to surrender those things which in themselves are good, we [474]\nmay be sure that God is thus working out for us some higher good.\nIn the future life the mysteries that here have annoyed and dis-\nappointed us will be made plain. We shall see that our seemingly\nunanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been among our\ngreatest blessings.\nWe are to look upon every duty, however humble, as sacred\nbecause it is a part of God\u2019s service. Our daily prayer should be,\n\u201cLord, help me to do my best. Teach me how to do better work.\nGive me energy and cheerfulness. Help me to bring into my service\nthe loving ministry of the Saviour.\u201d\nA Lesson From the Life of Moses\nConsider the experience of Moses. The education he received in\nEgypt as the king\u2019s grandson and the prospective heir to the throne\nwas very thorough. Nothing was neglected that was calculated to\nmake him a wise man, as the Egyptians understood wisdom. He\nreceived the highest civil and military training. He felt that he was\nfully prepared for the work of delivering Israel from bondage. But\n334 The Ministry of Healing\nGod judged otherwise. His providence appointed Moses forty years\nof training in the wilderness as a keeper of sheep.\nThe education that Moses had received in Egypt was a help to\nhim in many respects; but the most valuable preparation for his\nlifework was that which he received while employed as a shepherd.\nMoses was naturally of an impetuous spirit. In Egypt a successful\nmilitary leader and a favorite with the king and the nation, he had\nbeen accustomed to receiving praise and flattery. He had attracted\nthe people to himself. He hoped to accomplish by his own powers\nthe work of delivering Israel. Far different were the lessons he had to\nlearn as God\u2019s representative. As he led his flocks through the wilds\nof the mountains and into the green pastures of the valleys, he learned\nfaith and meekness, patience, humility, and self-forgetfulness. He\nlearned to care for the weak, to nurse the sick, to seek after the[475]\nstraying, to bear with the unruly, to tend the lambs, and to nurture\nthe old and the feeble.\nIn this work Moses was drawn nearer to the Chief Shepherd. He\nbecame closely united to the Holy One of Israel. No longer did he\nplan to do a great work. He sought to do faithfully as unto God the\nwork committed to his charge. He recognized the presence of God\nin his surroundings. All nature spoke to him of the Unseen One. He\nknew God as a personal God, and, in meditating upon His character\nhe grasped more and more fully the sense of His presence. He found\nrefuge in the everlasting arms.\nAfter this experience, Moses heard the call from heaven to ex-\nchange his shepherd\u2019s crook for the rod of authority; to leave his\nflock of sheep and take the leadership of Israel. The divine com-\nmand found him self-distrustful, slow of speech, and timid. He\nwas overwhelmed with a sense of his incapacity to be a mouthpiece\nfor God. But he accepted the work, putting his whole trust in the\nLord. The greatness of his mission called into exercise the best pow-\ners of his mind. God blessed his ready obedience, and he became\neloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, fitted for the greatest work ever\ngiven to man. Of him it is written: \u201cThere hath not arisen a prophet\nsince in Israel like unto Moses, whom Jehovah knew face to face.\u201d\nDeuteronomy 34:10, A.R.V .\nLet those who feel that their work is not appreciated, and who[476]\ncrave a position of greater responsibility, consider that \u201cpromotion\nHelp in Daily Living 335\ncometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.\nBut God is the Judge: He putteth down one, and setteth up another.\u201d\nPsalm 75:6, 7. Every man has his place in the eternal plan of heaven.\nWhether we fill that place depends upon our own faithfulness in\nco-operating with God.\nWe need to beware of self-pity. Never indulge the feeling that\nyou are not esteemed as you should be, that your efforts are not\nappreciated, that your work is too difficult. Let the memory of what\nChrist has endured for us silence every murmuring thought. We\nare treated better than was our Lord. \u201cSeekest thou great things for\nthyself? seek them not.\u201d Jeremiah 45:5. The Lord has no place in\nHis work for those who have a greater desire to win the crown than\nto bear the cross. He wants men who are more intent upon doing\ntheir duty than upon receiving their reward\u2014men who are more [477]\nsolicitous for principle than for promotion.\nThose who are humble, and who do their work as unto God, may\nnot make so great a show as do those who are full of bustle and\nself-importance; but their work counts for more. Often those who\nmake a great parade call attention to self, interposing between the\npeople and God, and their work proves a failure. \u201cWisdom is the\nprincipal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get\nunderstanding. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring\nthee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.\u201d Proverbs 4:7, 8.\nBecause they have not the determination to take themselves in\nhand and to reform, many become stereotyped in a wrong course\nof action. But this need not be. They may cultivate their powers\nto do the very best kind of service, and then they will be always in\ndemand. They will be valued for all that they are worth.\nIf any are qualified for a higher position, the Lord will lay the\nburden, not alone on them, but on those who have tested them, who\nknow their worth, and who can understandingly urge them forward.\nIt is those who perform faithfully their appointed work day by day,\nwho in God\u2019s own time will hear His call, \u201cCome up higher.\u201d\nWhile the shepherds were watching their flocks on the hills of\nBethlehem, angels from heaven visited them. So today while the\nhumble worker for God is following his employment, angels of God\nstand by his side, listening to his words, noting the manner in which\n336 The Ministry of Healing\nhis work is done, to see if larger responsibilities may be entrusted to\nhis hands.\nNot by their wealth, their education, or their position does God\nestimate men. He estimates them by their purity of motive and their\nbeauty of character. He looks to see how much of His Spirit they[478]\npossess and how much of His likeness their life reveals. To be great\nin God\u2019s kingdom is to be as a little child in humility, in simplicity\nof faith, and in purity of love.\n\u201cYe know,\u201d Christ said, \u201cthat the rulers of the Gentiles lord it\nover them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Not so\nshall it be among you: but whosoever would become great among\nyou shall be your minister.\u201d Matthew 20:25, 26, A.R.V .\nOf all the gifts that heaven can bestow upon men, fellowship\nwith Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty trust and the highest\nhonor. Not Enoch, who was translated to heaven, not Elijah, who\nascended in a chariot of fire, was greater or more honored than John\nthe Baptist, who perished alone in the dungeon. \u201cUnto you it is\ngiven in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to\nsuffer for His sake.\u201d Philippians 1:29.\nPlans for the Future\nMany are unable to make definite plans for the future. Their life\nis unsettled. They cannot discern the outcome of affairs, and this\noften fills them with anxiety and unrest. Let us remember that the\nlife of God\u2019s children in this world is a pilgrim life. We have not\nwisdom to plan our own lives. It is not for us to shape our future.\n\u201cBy faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which\nhe should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out,[479]\nnot knowing whither he went.\u201d Hebrews 11:8.\nChrist in His life on earth made no plans for Himself. He ac-\ncepted God\u2019s plans for Him, and day by day the Father unfolded His\nplans. So should we depend upon God, that our lives may be the\nsimple outworking of His will. As we commit our ways to Him, He\nwill direct our steps.\nToo many, in planning for a brilliant future, make an utter failure.\nLet God plan for you. As a little child, trust to the guidance of Him\nwho will \u201ckeep the feet of His saints.\u201d 1 Samuel 2:9. God never\nHelp in Daily Living 337\nleads His children otherwise than they would choose to be led, if\nthey could see the end from the beginning and discern the glory of\nthe purpose which they are fulfilling as co-workers with Him.\nWages\nWhen Christ called His disciples to follow Him, He offered them\nno flattering prospects in this life. He gave them no promise of gain\nor worldly honor, nor did they make any stipulation as to what they\nshould receive. To Matthew as he sat at the receipt of custom, the\nSaviour said, \u201cFollow Me. And he left all, rose up, and followed\nHim.\u201d Luke 5:27, 28. Matthew did not, before rendering service,\nwait to demand a certain salary equal to the amount received in his\nformer occupation. Without question or hesitation he followed Jesus. [480]\nIt was enough for him that he was to be with the Saviour, that he\nmight hear His words and unite with Him in His work.\nSo it was with the disciples previously called. When Jesus bade\nPeter and his companions follow Him, immediately they left their\nboats and nets. Some of these disciples had friends dependent on\nthem for support; but when they received the Saviour\u2019s invitation\nthey did not hesitate and inquire, \u201cHow shall I live and sustain my\nfamily?\u201d They were obedient to the call; and when afterward Jesus\nasked them, \u201cWhen I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes,\nlacked ye anything?\u201d they could answer, \u201cNothing.\u201d Luke 22:35.\nToday the Saviour calls us, as He called Matthew and John\nand Peter, to His work. If our hearts are touched by His love, the\nquestion of compensation will not be uppermost in our minds. We\nshall rejoice to be co-workers with Christ, and we shall not fear to\ntrust His care. If we make God our strength we shall have clear\nperceptions of duty, unselfish aspirations; our life will be actuated\nby a noble purpose which will raise us above sordid motives.\nGod Will Provide\nMany who profess to be Christ\u2019s followers have an anxious,\ntroubled heart because they are afraid to trust themselves with God.\nThey do not make a complete surrender to Him, for they shrink from [481]\n338 The Ministry of Healing\nthe consequences that such a surrender may involve. Unless they do\nmake this surrender they cannot find peace.\nThere are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care\nbecause they seek to reach the world\u2019s standard. They have chosen\nits service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their\ncharacter is marred and their life made a weariness. The continual\nworry is wearing out the life forces. Our Lord desires them to lay\naside this yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept His yoke; He\nsays, \u201cMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Worry is blind and\ncannot discern the future; but Jesus sees the end from the beginning.\nIn every difficulty He has His way prepared to bring relief. \u201cNo good\nthing will He withhold from them that walk uprightly.\u201d Matthew\n11:30; Psalm 84:11.\nOur heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us of\nwhich we know nothing. Those who accept the one principle of\nmaking the service of God supreme, will find perplexities vanish\nand a plain path before their feet.\nThe faithful discharge of today\u2019s duties is the best preparation for\ntomorrow\u2019s trials. Do not gather together all tomorrow\u2019s liabilities\nand cares and add them to the burden of today. \u201cSufficient unto the\nday is the evil thereof.\u201d Matthew 6:34.\nLet us be hopeful and courageous. Despondency in God\u2019s service\nis sinful and unreasonable. He knows our every necessity. To the\nomnipotence of the King of kings our covenant-keeping God unites\nthe gentleness and care of the tender shepherd. His power is absolute,\nand it is the pledge of the sure fulfillment of His promises to all who\ntrust in Him. He has means for the removal of every difficulty, that\nthose who serve Him and respect the means He employs may be\nsustained. His love is as far above all other love as the heavens are[482]\nabove the earth. He watches over His children with a love that is\nmeasureless and everlasting.\nIn the darkest days, when appearances seem most forbidding,\nhave faith in God. He is working out His will, doing all things well\nin behalf of His people. The strength of those who love and serve\nHim will be renewed day by day.\nHe is able and willing to bestow upon His servants all the help\nthey need. He will give them the wisdom which their varied necessi-\nties demand.\nHelp in Daily Living 339\nSaid the tried apostle Paul: \u201cHe said unto me, My grace is suffi-\ncient for thee: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. Most\ngladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power\nof Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmi-\nties, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for\nChrist\u2019s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n12:9, 10.\nChapter 41\u2014In Contact With Others[483]\nEvery association of life calls for the exercise of self-control,\nforbearance, and sympathy. We differ so widely in disposition,\nhabits, education, that our ways of looking at things vary. We judge\ndifferently. Our understanding of truth, our ideas in regard to the\nconduct of life, are not in all respects the same. There are no two\nwhose experience is alike in every particular. The trials of one are\nnot the trials of another. The duties that one finds light are to another\nmost difficult and perplexing.\nSo frail, so ignorant, so liable to misconception is human nature,\nthat each should be careful in the estimate he places upon another.\nWe little know the bearing of our acts upon the experience of others.\nWhat we do or say may seem to us of little moment, when, could\nour eyes be opened, we should see that upon it depended the most\nimportant results for good or for evil.\nConsideration for Burden Bearers\nMany have borne so few burdens, their hearts have known so\nlittle real anguish, they have felt so little perplexity and distress in\nbehalf of others, that they cannot understand the work of the true[484]\nburden bearer. No more capable are they of appreciating his burdens\nthan is the child of understanding the care and toil of his burdened\nfather. The child may wonder at his father\u2019s fears and perplexities.\nThese appear needless to him. But when years of experience shall\nhave been added to his life, when he himself comes to bear its\nburdens, he will look back upon his father\u2019s life and understand that\nwhich was once so incomprehensible. Bitter experience has given\nhim knowledge.\nThe work of many a burden bearer is not understood, his labors\nare not appreciated, until death lays him low. When others take up\nthe burdens he has laid down, and meet the difficulties he encoun-\ntered, they can understand how his faith and courage were tested.\n340\nIn Contact With Others 341\nOften then the mistakes they were so quick to censure are lost sight\nof. Experience teaches them sympathy. God permits men to be\nplaced in positions of responsibility. When they err, He has power\nto correct or to remove them. We should be careful not to take into\nour hands the work of judging that belongs to God.\nThe conduct of David toward Saul has a lesson. By command\nof God, Saul had been anointed as king over Israel. Because of his\ndisobedience the Lord declared that the kingdom should be taken\nfrom him; and yet how tender and courteous and forbearing was the\nconduct of David toward him! In seeking the life of David, Saul\ncame into the wilderness and, unattended, entered the very cave\nwhere David with his men of war lay hidden. \u201cAnd the men of David\nsaid unto him, Behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee, ... I [485]\nwill deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him\nas it shall seem good unto thee.... And he said unto his men, The\nLord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the Lord\u2019s\nanointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the\nanointed of the Lord.\u201d The Saviour bids us, \u201cJudge not, that ye be\nnot judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged:\nand with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\u201d\nRemember that soon your life record will pass in review before God.\nRemember, too, that He has said, \u201cThou art inexcusable, O man,\nwhosoever thou art that judgest: ... for thou that judgest doest the\nsame things.\u201d 1 Samuel 24:4-6; Matthew 7:1, 2; Romans 2:1.\nForbearance Under Wrong\nWe cannot afford to let our spirits chafe over any real or supposed\nwrong done to ourselves. Self is the enemy we most need to fear.\nNo form of vice has a more baleful effect upon the character than\nhas human passion not under the control of the Holy Spirit. No other\nvictory we can gain will be so precious as the victory gained over\nself.\nWe should not allow our feelings to be easily wounded. We\nare to live, not to guard our feelings or our reputation, but to save\nsouls. As we become interested in the salvation of souls we cease\nto mind the little differences that so often arise in our association\nwith one another. Whatever others may think of us or do to us, it\n342 The Ministry of Healing\nneed not disturb our oneness with Christ, the fellowship of the Spirit.\n\u201cWhat glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall\ntake it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it\npatiently, this is acceptable with God.\u201d 1 Peter 2:20.\nDo not retaliate. So far as you can do so, remove all cause for[486]\nmisapprehension. Avoid the appearance of evil. Do all that lies in\nyour power, without the sacrifice of principle, to conciliate others.\n\u201cIf thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy\nbrother hath aught against thee; leave there thy gift before the altar,\nand go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come\nand offer thy gift.\u201d Matthew 5:23, 24.\nIf impatient words are spoken to you, never reply in the same\nspirit. Remember that \u201ca soft answer turneth away wrath.\u201d Proverbs\n15:1. And there is wonderful power in silence. Words spoken in\nreply to one who is angry sometimes serve only to exasperate. But\nanger met with silence, in a tender, forbearing spirit, quickly dies\naway.\nUnder a storm of stinging, faultfinding words, keep the mind\nstayed upon the word of God. Let mind and heart be stored with\nGod\u2019s promises. If you are ill-treated or wrongfully accused, in-\nstead of returning an angry answer, repeat to yourself the precious\npromises:\n\u201cBe not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d Romans\n12:21.\n\u201cCommit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in Him; and He shall\nbring it to pass. And He shall bring forth thy righteousness as the\nlight, and thy judgment as the noonday.\u201d Psalm 37:5, 6.\n\u201cThere is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid,\nthat shall not be known.\u201d Luke 12:2.\n\u201cThou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through\nfire and through water: but Thou broughtest us out into a wealthy\nplace.\u201d Psalm 66:12.\nWe are prone to look to our fellow men for sympathy and uplift-\ning, instead of looking to Jesus. In His mercy and faithfulness God\noften permits those in whom we place confidence to fail us, in order\nthat we may learn the folly of trusting in man and making flesh our\narm. Let us trust fully, humbly, unselfishly in God. He knows the\nsorrows that we feel to the depths of our being, but which we cannot[487]\nIn Contact With Others 343\nexpress. When all things seem dark and unexplainable, remember\nthe words of Christ, \u201cWhat I do thou knowest not now; but thou\nshalt know hereafter.\u201d John 13:7.\nStudy the history of Joseph and of Daniel. The Lord did not\nprevent the plottings of men who sought to do them harm; but He\ncaused all these devices to work for good to His servants who amidst\ntrial and conflict preserved their faith and loyalty.\nSo long as we are in the world, we shall meet with adverse\ninfluences. There will be provocations to test the temper; and it is by\nmeeting these in a right spirit that the Christian graces are developed.\nIf Christ dwells in us, we shall be patient, kind, and forbearing,\ncheerful amid frets and irritations. Day by day and year by year\nwe shall conquer self, and grow into a noble heroism. This is our\nallotted task; but it cannot be accomplished without help from Jesus,\nresolute decision, unwavering purpose, continual watchfulness, and\nunceasing prayer. Each one has a personal battle to fight. Not even\nGod can make our characters noble or our lives useful, unless we\nbecome co-workers with Him. Those who decline the struggle lose\nthe strength and joy of victory.\nWe need not keep our own record of trials and difficulties, griefs,\nand sorrows. All these things are written in the books, and heaven\nwill take care of them. While we are counting up the disagreeable\nthings, many things that are pleasant to reflect upon are passing\nfrom memory, such as the merciful kindness of God surrounding\nus every moment and the love over which angels marvel, that God\ngave His Son to die for us. If as workers for Christ you feel that you\nhave had greater cares and trials than have fallen to the lot of others,\nremember that for you there is a peace unknown to those who shun\nthese burdens. There is comfort and joy in the service of Christ. Let [488]\nthe world see that life with Him is no failure.\nIf you do not feel lighthearted and joyous, do not talk of your\nfeelings. Cast no shadow upon the lives of others. A cold, sunless\nreligion never draws souls to Christ. It drives them away from Him\ninto the nets that Satan has spread for the feet of the straying. Instead\nof thinking of your discouragements, think of the power you can\nclaim in Christ\u2019s name. Let your imagination take hold upon things\nunseen. Let your thoughts be directed to the evidences of the great\nlove of God for you. Faith can endure trial, resist temptation, bear\n344 The Ministry of Healing\nup under disappointment. Jesus lives as our advocate. All is ours\nthat His mediation secures.\nThink you not that Christ values those who live wholly for Him?\nThink you not that He visits those who, like the beloved John in exile,\nare for His sake in hard and trying places? God will not suffer one\nof His truehearted workers to be left alone, to struggle against great\nodds and be overcome. He preserves as a precious jewel everyone\nwhose life is hid with Christ in Him. Of every such one He says: \u201cI\n... will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee.\u201d Haggai 2:23.\nThen talk of the promises; talk of Jesus\u2019 willingness to bless. He\ndoes not forget us for one brief moment. When, notwithstanding\ndisagreeable circumstances, we rest confidingly in His love, and shut\nourselves in with Him, the sense of His presence will inspire a deep,\ntranquil joy. Of Himself Christ said: \u201cI do nothing of Myself; but as\nMy Father hath taught Me, I speak these things. And He that sent\nMe is with Me: the Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always\nthose things that please Him.\u201d John 8:28, 29.\nThe Father\u2019s presence encircled Christ, and nothing befell Him[489]\nbut that which infinite love permitted for the blessing of the world.\nHere was His source of comfort, and it is for us. He who is imbued\nwith the Spirit of Christ abides in Christ. Whatever comes to him\ncomes from the Saviour, who surrounds him with His presence.\nNothing can touch him except by the Lord\u2019s permission. All our\nsufferings and sorrows, all our temptations and trials, all our sadness\nand griefs, all our persecutions and privations, in short, all things\nwork together for our good. All experiences and circumstances are\nGod\u2019s workmen whereby good is brought to us.\nIf we have a sense of the long-suffering of God toward us, we\nshall not be found judging or accusing others. When Christ was\nliving on the earth, how surprised His associates would have been, if,\nafter becoming acquainted with Him, they had heard Him speak one\nword of accusation, of fault-finding, or of impatience. Let us never\nforget that those who love Him are to represent Him in character.\n\u201cBe kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in\nhonor preferring one another.\u201d \u201cNot rendering evil for evil, or railing\nfor railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto\ncalled, that ye should inherit a blessing.\u201d Romans 12:10; 1 Peter 3:9.\nIn Contact With Others 345\nThe Lord Jesus demands our acknowledgment of the rights of\nevery man. Men\u2019s social rights, and their rights as Christians, are\nto be taken into consideration. All are to be treated with refinement\nand delicacy, as the sons and daughters of God.\nChristianity will make a man a gentleman. Christ was courteous,\neven to His persecutors; and His true followers will manifest the\nsame spirit. Look at Paul when brought before rulers. His speech be-\nfore Agrippa is an illustration of true courtesy as well as persuasive\neloquence. The gospel does not encourage the formal politeness cur- [490]\nrent with the world, but the courtesy that springs from real kindness\nof heart.\nThe most careful cultivation of the outward proprieties of life\nis not sufficient to shut out all fretfulness, harsh judgment, and\nunbecoming speech. True refinement will never be revealed so long\nas self is considered as the supreme object. Love must dwell in\nthe heart. A thoroughgoing Christian draws his motives of action\nfrom his deep heart love for his Master. Up through the roots of\nhis affection for Christ springs an unselfish interest in his brethren.\nLove imparts to its possessor grace, propriety, and comeliness of\ndeportment. It illuminates the countenance and subdues the voice; it\nrefines and elevates the whole being.\nLife is chiefly made up, not of great sacrifices and wonderful\nachievements, but of little things. It is oftenest through the little\nthings which seem so unworthy of notice that great good or evil is\nbrought into our lives. It is through our failure to endure the tests that\ncome to us in little things, that the habits are molded, the character\nmisshaped; and when the greater tests come, they find us unready.\nOnly by acting upon principle in the tests of daily life can we acquire\npower to stand firm and faithful in the most dangerous and most\ndifficult positions.\nWe are never alone. Whether we choose Him or not, we have\na companion. Remember that wherever you are, whatever you do,\nGod is there. Nothing that is said or done or thought can escape\nHis attention. To your every word or deed you have a witness\u2014the\nholy, sin-hating God. Before you speak or act, always think of this.\nAs a Christian, you are a member of the royal family, a child of the [491]\nheavenly King. Say no word, do no act, that shall bring dishonor\nupon \u201cthat worthy name by the which ye are called.\u201d James 2:7.\n346 The Ministry of Healing\nStudy carefully the divine-human character, and constantly in-\nquire, \u201cWhat would Jesus do were He in my place?\u201d This should be\nthe measurement of our duty. Do not place yourselves needlessly in\nthe society of those who by their arts would weaken your purpose to\ndo right, or bring a stain upon your conscience. Do nothing among\nstrangers, in the street, on the cars, in the home, that would have\nthe least appearance of evil. Do something every day to improve,\nbeautify, and ennoble the life that Christ has purchased with His\nown blood.\nAlways act from principle, never from impulse. Temper the\nnatural impetuosity of your nature with meekness and gentleness.\nIndulge in no lightness or trifling. Let no low witticism escape your\nlips. Even the thoughts are not to be allowed to run riot. They must\nbe restrained, brought into captivity to the obedience of Christ. Let\nthem be placed upon holy things. Then, through the grace of Christ,\nthey will be pure and true.\nWe need a constant sense of the ennobling power of pure\nthoughts. The only security for any soul is right thinking. As a\nman \u201cthinketh in his heart, so is he.\u201d Proverbs 23:7. The power\nof self-restraint strengthens by exercise. That which at first seems\ndifficult, by constant repetition grows easy, until right thoughts and\nactions become habitual. If we will we may turn away from all\nthat is cheap and inferior, and rise to a high standard; we may be\nrespected by men and beloved of God.\nCultivate the habit of speaking well of others. Dwell upon the[492]\ngood qualities of those with whom you associate, and see as little as\npossible of their errors and failings. When tempted to complain of\nwhat someone has said or done, praise something in that person\u2019s\nlife or character. Cultivate thankfulness. Praise God for His won-\nderful love in giving Christ to die for us. It never pays to think of\nour grievances. God calls upon us to think of His mercy and His\nmatchless love, that we may be inspired with praise.\nEarnest workers have no time for dwelling upon the faults of\nothers. We cannot afford to live on the husks of others\u2019 faults or\nfailings. Evilspeaking is a twofold curse, falling more heavily upon\nthe speaker than upon the hearer. He who scatters the seeds of\ndissension and strife reaps in his own soul the deadly fruits. The\nvery act of looking for evil in others develops evil in those who look.\nIn Contact With Others 347\nBy dwelling upon the faults of others, we are changed into the same\nimage. But by beholding Jesus, talking of His love and perfection of\ncharacter, we become changed into His image. By contemplating\nthe lofty ideal He has placed before us, we shall be uplifted into\na pure and holy atmosphere, even the presence of God. When we\nabide here, there goes forth from us a light that irradiates all who\nare connected with us.\nInstead of criticizing and condemning others, say, \u201cI must work\nout my own salvation. If I co-operate with Him who desires to save\nmy soul, I must watch myself diligently. I must put away every\nevil from my life. I must overcome every fault. I must become a\nnew creature in Christ. Then, instead of weakening those who are\nstriving against evil, I can strengthen them by encouraging words.\u201d\nWe are too indifferent in regard to one another. Too often we forget\nthat our fellow laborers are in need of strength and cheer. Take care [493]\nto assure them of your interest and sympathy. Help them by your\nprayers, and let them know that you do it.\nNot all who profess to be workers for Christ are true disciples.\nAmong those who bear His name, and who are even numbered with\nHis workers, are some who do not represent Him in character. They\nare not governed by His principles. These persons are often a cause\nof perplexity and discouragement to their fellow workers who are\nyoung in Christian experience; but none need be misled. Christ has\ngiven us a perfect example. He bids us follow Him.\nTill the end of time there will be tares among the wheat. When\nthe servants of the householder, in their zeal for his honor, asked\npermission to root out the tares, the master said: \u201cNay; lest while ye\ngather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both\ngrow together until the harvest.\u201d Matthew 13:29, 30.\nIn His mercy and long-suffering, God bears patiently with the\nperverse and even the falsehearted. Among Christ\u2019s chosen apos-\ntles was Judas the traitor. Should it then be a cause of surprise or\ndiscouragement that there are falsehearted ones among His workers\ntoday? If He who reads the heart could bear with him who He knew\nwas to be His betrayer, with what patience should we bear with those\nat fault.\nAnd not all, even of those who appear most faulty, are like Judas.\nPeter, impetuous, hasty, and self-confident, often appeared to far\n348 The Ministry of Healing\ngreater disadvantage than Judas did. He was oftener reproved by the\nSaviour. But what a life of service and sacrifice was his! What a\ntestimony does it bear to the power of God\u2019s grace! So far as we are\ncapable, we are to be to others what Jesus was to His disciples when\nHe walked and talked with them on the earth.\nRegard yourselves as missionaries, first of all, among your fellow[494]\nworkers. Often it requires a vast amount of time and labor to win\none soul to Christ. And when a soul turns from sin to righteousness,\nthere is joy in the presence of the angels. Think you that the min-\nistering spirits who watch over these souls are pleased to see how\nindifferently they are treated by some who claim to be Christians?\nShould Jesus deal with us as we too often deal with one another,\nwho of us could be saved?\nRemember that you cannot read hearts. You do not know the\nmotives which prompted the actions that to you look wrong. There\nare many who have not received a right education; their characters\nare warped, they are hard and gnarled, and seem to be crooked in\nevery way. But the grace of Christ can transform them. Never cast\nthem aside, never drive them to discouragement or despair by saying,\n\u201cYou have disappointed me, and I will not try to help you.\u201d A few\nwords spoken hastily under provocation\u2014just what we think they\ndeserve\u2014may cut the cords of influence that should have bound\ntheir hearts to ours.\nThe consistent life, the patient forbearance, the spirit unruffled\nunder provocation, is always the most conclusive argument and the\nmost solemn appeal. If you have had opportunities and advantages\nthat have not fallen to the lot of others, consider this, and be ever a\nwise, careful, gentle teacher.\nIn order to have the wax take a clear, strong impression of the\nseal, you do not dash the seal upon it in a hasty, violent way; you\ncarefully place the seal on the plastic wax and quietly, steadily\npress it down until it has hardened in the mold. In like manner\ndeal with human souls. The continuity of Christian influence is the\nsecret of its power, and this depends on the steadfastness of your\nmanifestation of the character of Christ. Help those who have erred,\nby telling them of your experiences. Show how, when you made[495]\ngrave mistakes, patience, kindness, and helpfulness on the part of\nyour fellow workers gave you courage and hope.\nIn Contact With Others 349\nUntil the judgment you will never know the influence of a kind,\nconsiderate course toward the inconsistent, the unreasonable, the\nunworthy. When we meet with ingratitude and betrayal of sacred\ntrusts, we are roused to show our contempt or indignation. This\nthe guilty expect; they are prepared for it. But kind forbearance\ntakes them by surprise and often awakens their better impulses and\narouses a longing for a nobler life.\n\u201cBrethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual,\nrestore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself,\nlest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another\u2019s burdens, and so\nfulfill the law of Christ.\u201d Galatians 6:1, 2.\nAll who profess to be children of God should bear in mind that\nas missionaries they will be brought into contact with all classes of\nminds. There are the refined and the coarse, the humble and the\nproud, the religious and the skeptical, the educated and the ignorant,\nthe rich and the poor. These varied minds cannot be treated alike; [496]\nyet all need kindness and sympathy. By mutual contact our minds\nshould receive polish and refinement. We are dependent upon one\nanother, closely bound together by the ties of human brotherhood.\n\u201cHeaven forming each on other to depend,\nA master or a servant or a friend,\nBids each on other for assistance call,\nTill one man\u2019s weakness grows the strength of all.\u201d\nIt is through the social relations that Christianity comes in contact\nwith the world. Every man or woman who has received the divine\nillumination is to shed light on the dark pathway of those who are\nunacquainted with the better way. Social power, sanctified by the\nSpirit of Christ, must be improved in bringing souls to the Saviour.\nChrist is not to be hid away in the heart as a coveted treasure, sacred\nand sweet, to be enjoyed solely by the possessor. We are to have\nChrist in us as a well of water, springing up into everlasting life,\nrefreshing all who come in contact with us.\nChapter 42\u2014Development and Service[497]\nChristian life is more than many take it to be. It does not consist\nwholly in gentleness, patience, meekness, and kindliness. These\ngraces are essential; but there is need also of courage, force, energy,\nand perseverance. The path that Christ marks out is a narrow, self-\ndenying path. To enter that path and press on through difficulties\nand discouragements requires men who are more than weaklings.\nForce of Character\nMen of stamina are wanted, men who will not wait to have their\nway smoothed and every obstacle removed, men who will inspire\nwith fresh zeal the flagging efforts of dispirited workers, men whose\nhearts are warm with Christian love and whose hands are strong to\ndo their Master\u2019s work.\nSome who engage in missionary service are weak, nerveless,\nspiritless, easily discouraged. They lack push. They have not those\npositive traits of character that give power to do something\u2014the\nspirit and energy that kindle enthusiasm. Those who would win\nsuccess must be courageous and hopeful. They should cultivate not\nonly the passive but the active virtues. While they are to give the\nsoft answer that turns away wrath, they must possess the courage of[498]\na hero to resist evil. With the charity that endures all things, they\nneed the force of character that will make their influence a positive\npower.\nSome have no firmness of character. Their plans and purposes\nhave no definite form and consistency. They are of but little practical\nuse in the world. This weakness, indecision, and inefficiency should\nbe overcome. There is in true Christian character an indomitableness\nthat cannot be molded or subdued by adverse circumstances. We\nmust have moral backbone, an integrity that cannot be flattered,\nbribed, or terrified.\n350\nDevelopment and Service 351\nGod desires us to make use of every opportunity for securing a\npreparation for His work. He expects us to put all our energies into\nits performance and to keep our hearts alive to its sacredness and its\nfearful responsibilities.\nMany who are qualified to do excellent work accomplish little\nbecause they attempt little. Thousands pass through life as if they\nhad no great object for which to live, no high standard to reach. One\nreason for this is the low estimate which they place upon themselves.\nChrist paid an infinite price for us, and according to the price paid\nHe desires us to value ourselves.\nBe not satisfied with reaching a low standard. We are not what\nwe might be, or what it is God\u2019s will that we should be. God has\ngiven us reasoning powers, not to remain inactive, or to be perverted\nto earthly and sordid pursuits, but that they may be developed to\nthe utmost, refined, sanctified, ennobled, and used in advancing the\ninterests of His kingdom.\nNone should consent to be mere machines, run by another man\u2019s\nmind. God has given us ability, to think and to act, and it is by acting\nwith carefulness, looking to Him for wisdom that you will become [499]\ncapable of bearing burdens. Stand in your God-given personality.\nBe no other person\u2019s shadow. Expect that the Lord will work in and\nby and through you.\nNever think that you have learned enough, and that you may now\nrelax your efforts. The cultivated mind is the measure of the man.\nYour education should continue during your lifetime; every day you\nshould be learning and putting to practical use the knowledge gained.\nRemember that in whatever position you may serve you are\nrevealing motive, developing character. Whatever your work, do it\nwith exactness, with diligence; overcome the inclination to seek an\neasy task.\nThe same spirit and principles that one brings into the daily labor\nwill be brought into the whole life. Those who desire a fixed amount\nto do and a fixed salary, and who wish to prove an exact fit without\nthe trouble of adaptation or training, are not the ones whom God\ncalls to work in His cause. Those who study how to give as little\nas possible of their physical, mental, and moral power are not the\nworkers upon whom He can pour out abundant blessings. Their\nexample is contagious. Self-interest is the ruling motive. Those who\n352 The Ministry of Healing\nneed to be watched and who work only as every duty is specified to\nthem, are not the ones who will be pronounced good and faithful.\nWorkers are needed who manifest energy, integrity, diligence, those\nwho are willing to do anything that needs to be done.\nMany become inefficient by evading responsibilities for fear of[500]\nfailure. Thus they fail of gaining that education which results from\nexperience, and which reading and study and all the advantages\notherwise gained cannot give them.\nMan can shape circumstances, but circumstances should not be\nallowed to shape the man. We should seize upon circumstances as\ninstruments by which to work. We are to master them, but should\nnot permit them to master us.\nMen of power are those who have been opposed, baffled, and\nthwarted. By calling their energies into action, the obstacles they\nmeet prove to them positive blessings. They gain self-reliance.\nConflict and perplexity call for the exercise of trust in God and for\nthat firmness which develops power.\nChrist gave no stinted service. He did not measure His work by\nhours. His time, His heart, His soul and strength, were given to labor\nfor the benefit of humanity. Through weary days He toiled, and\nthrough long nights He bent in prayer for grace and endurance that\nHe might do a larger work. With strong crying and tears He sent His\npetitions to heaven, that His human nature might be strengthened,\nthat He might be braced to meet the wily foe in all his deceptive\nworkings, and fortified to fulfill His mission of uplifting humanity.\nTo His workers He says, \u201cI have given you an example, that ye\nshould do as I have done.\u201d John 13:15.\n\u201cThe love of Christ,\u201d said Paul, \u201cconstraineth us.\u201d 2 Corinthians\n5:14. This was the actuating principle of his conduct; it was his\nmotive power. If ever his ardor in the path of duty flagged for a\nmoment, one glance at the cross caused him to gird up anew the\nloins of his mind and press forward in the way of self-denial. In\nhis labors for his brethren he relied much upon the manifestation of\ninfinite love in the sacrifice of Christ, with its subduing, constraining\npower.\nHow earnest, how touching, his appeal: \u201cYe know the grace[501]\nof our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for your\nsakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be rich.\u201d\nDevelopment and Service 353\n2 Corinthians 8:9. You know the height from which He stooped,\nthe depth of humiliation to which He descended. His feet entered\nupon the path of sacrifice and turned not aside until He had given\nHis life. There was no rest for Him between the throne in heaven\nand the cross. His love for man led Him to welcome every indignity\nand suffer every abuse.\nPaul admonishes us to \u201clook not every man on his own things,\nbut every man also on the things of others.\u201d He bids us possess the\nmind \u201cwhich was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of\nGod, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself\nof no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was\nmade in the likeness of men: and being found in fashion as a man,\nHe humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the\ndeath of the cross.\u201d Philippians 2:4-8.\nPaul was deeply anxious that the humiliation of Christ should\nbe seen and realized. He was convinced that if men could be led\nto consider the amazing sacrifice made by the Majesty of heaven,\nselfishness would be banished from their hearts. The apostle lingers\nover point after point, that we may in some measure comprehend\nthe wonderful condescension of the Saviour in behalf of sinners. He\ndirects the mind first to the position which Christ occupied in heaven\nin the bosom of His Father; he reveals Him afterward as laying\naside His glory, voluntarily subjecting Himself to the humbling\nconditions of man\u2019s life, assuming the responsibilities of a servant,\nand becoming obedient unto death, and that the most ignominious\nand revolting, the most agonizing\u2014the death of the cross. Can we\ncontemplate this wonderful manifestation of the love of God without\ngratitude and love, and a deep sense of the fact that we are not our\nown? Such a Master should not be served from grudging, selfish [502]\nmotives.\n\u201cYe know,\u201d says Peter, \u201cthat ye were not redeemed with corrupt-\nible things, as silver and gold.\u201d 1 Peter 1:18. Oh, had these been\nsufficient to purchase the salvation of man, how easily it might have\nbeen accomplished by Him who says, \u201cThe silver is Mine, and the\ngold is Mine\u201d! Haggai 2:8. But the sinner could be redeemed only\nby the precious blood of the Son of God. Those who, failing to ap-\npreciate this wonderful sacrifice, withhold themselves from Christ\u2019s\nservice, will perish in their selfishness.\n354 The Ministry of Healing\nSingleness of Purpose\nIn the life of Christ, everything was made subordinate to His\nwork, the great work of redemption which He came to accomplish.\nAnd the same devotion, the same self-denial and sacrifice, the same\nsubjection to the claims of the word of God, is to be manifest in His\ndisciples.\nEveryone who accepts Christ as his personal Saviour will long\nfor the privilege of serving God. Contemplating what heaven has\ndone for him, his heart is moved with boundless love and adoring\ngratitude. He is eager to signalize his gratitude by devoting his\nabilities to God\u2019s service. He longs to show his love for Christ and\nfor His purchased possession. He covets toil, hardship, sacrifice.\nThe true worker for God will do his best, because in so doing\nhe can glorify his Master. He will do right in order to regard the\nrequirements of God. He will endeavor to improve all his faculties.\nHe will perform every duty as unto God. His one desire will be that\nChrist may receive homage and perfect service.\nThere is a picture representing a bullock standing between a\nplow and an altar, with the inscription, \u201cReady for either,\u201d ready to\ntoil in the furrow or to be offered on the altar of sacrifice. This is the\nposition of the true child of God\u2014willing to go where duty calls, to\ndeny self, to sacrifice for the Redeemer\u2019s cause.\nChapter 43\u2014A Higher Experience [503]\nWe need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experi-\nence that harmonizes with His teachings. High and holy attainments\nare within our reach. Continual progress in knowledge and virtue is\nGod\u2019s purpose for us. His law is the echo of His own voice, giving\nto all the invitation, \u201cCome up higher. Be holy, holier still.\u201d Every\nday we may advance in perfection of Christian character.\nThose who are engaged in service for the Master need an expe-\nrience much higher, deeper, broader, than many have yet thought\nof having. Many who are already members of God\u2019s great family\nknow little of what it means to behold His glory and to be changed\nfrom glory to glory. Many have a twilight perception of Christ\u2019s\nexcellence, and their hearts thrill with joy. They long for a fuller,\ndeeper sense of the Saviour\u2019s love. Let these cherish every desire of\nthe soul after God. The Holy Spirit works with those who will be\nworked, molds those who will be molded, fashions those who will\nbe fashioned. Give yourselves the culture of spiritual thoughts and\nholy communings. You have seen but the first rays of the early dawn\nof His glory. As you follow on to know the Lord, you will know that\n\u201cthe path of the righteous is as the light of dawn, that shineth more [504]\nand more unto the perfect day.\u201d Proverbs 4:18, R.V ., margin.\n\u201cThese things have I spoken unto you,\u201d said Christ, \u201cthat My joy\nmight remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\u201d John 15:11.\nEver before Him, Christ saw the result of His mission. His\nearthly life, so full of toil and self-sacrifice, was cheered by the\nthought that He would not have all this travail for nought. By giving\nHis life for the life of men, He would restore in humanity the image\nof God. He would lift us up from the dust, reshape the character\nafter the pattern of His own character, and make it beautiful with\nHis own glory.\nChrist saw of the travail of His soul and was satisfied. He viewed\nthe expanse of eternity and saw the happiness of those who through\nHis humiliation should receive pardon and everlasting life. He was\n355\n356 The Ministry of Healing\nwounded for their transgressions, bruised for their iniquities. The\nchastisement of their peace was upon Him, and with His stripes they\nwere healed. He heard the shout of the redeemed. He heard the\nransomed ones singing the song of Moses and the Lamb. Although\nthe baptism of blood must first be received, although the sins of the\nworld were to weigh upon His innocent soul, although the shadow\nof an unspeakable woe was upon Him; yet for the joy that was set\nbefore Him He chose to endure the cross and despised the shame.\nThis joy all His followers are to share. However great and glori-\nous hereafter, our reward is not all to be reserved for the time of final\ndeliverance. Even here we are by faith to enter into the Saviour\u2019s\njoy. Like Moses, we are to endure as seeing the Invisible.\nNow the church is militant. Now we are confronted with a world\nin darkness, almost wholly given over to idolatry. But the day is[505]\n[506] coming when the battle will have been fought, the victory won. The\nwill of God is to be done on earth as it is done in heaven. The nations\nof the saved will know no other law than the law of heaven. All\nwill be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments of praise\nand thanksgiving\u2014the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. All nature,\nin its surpassing loveliness, will offer to God a tribute of praise and\nadoration. The world will be bathed in the light of heaven. The light\nof the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun\nwill be sevenfold greater than it is now. The years will move on in\ngladness. Over the scene the morning stars will sing together, the\nsons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will unite in\nproclaiming, \u201cThere shall be no more sin, neither shall there be any\nmore death.\u201d\nThese visions of future glory, scenes pictured by the hand of\nGod, should be dear to His children.\nStand on the threshold of eternity and hear the gracious wel-\ncome given to those who in this life have co-operated with Christ,\nregarding it as a privilege and an honor to suffer for His sake. With\nthe angels, they cast their crowns at the feet of the Redeemer, ex-\nclaiming, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and\nriches, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and bless-\ning.... Honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon\nthe throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.\u201d Revelation 5:12,\n13.\nHigher Experience 357\nThere the redeemed ones greet those who directed them to the\nuplifted Saviour. They unite in praising Him who died that human\nbeings might have the life that measures with the life of God. The\nconflict is over. All tribulation and strife are at an end. Songs of\nvictory fill all heaven, as the redeemed stand around the throne of [507]\nGod. All take up the joyful strain, \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was\nslain\u201d and hath redeemed us to God.\n\u201cI beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number,\nof all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before\nthe throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms\nin their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our\nGod which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d Revelation\n7:9, 10.\n\u201cThese are they which came out of great tribulation, and have\nwashed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.\nTherefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and\nnight in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell\namong them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;\nneither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which [508]\nis in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto\nliving fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from\ntheir eyes.\u201d \u201cAnd there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor\ncrying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things\nare passed away.\u201d Revelation 7:14-17; Revelation 21:4.\nWe need to keep ever before us this vision of things unseen. It is\nthus that we shall be able to set a right value on the things of eternity\nand the things of time. It is this that will give us power to influence\nothers for the higher life.\nIn the Mount With God\n\u201cCome up to Me into the mount,\u201d God bids us. To Moses, before\nhe could be God\u2019s instrument in delivering Israel, was appointed\nthe forty years of communion with Him in the mountain solitudes.\nBefore bearing God\u2019s message to Pharaoh, he spoke with the angel\nin the burning bush. Before receiving God\u2019s law as the representative\nof His people, he was called into the mount, and beheld His glory.\nBefore executing justice on the idolaters, he was hidden in the cleft\n358 The Ministry of Healing\nof the rock, and the Lord said, \u201cI will proclaim the name of the Lord\nbefore thee,\u201d \u201cmerciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant\nin loving-kindness and truth; ... and that will by no means clear the\nguilty.\u201d Exodus 33:19; 34:6, 7, A.R.V . Before he laid down, with his\nlife, his burden for Israel, God called him to the top of Pisgah and\nspread out before him the glory of the Promised Land.\nBefore the disciples went forth on their mission, they were called\nup into the mount with Jesus. Before the power and glory of Pente-\ncost, came the night of communion with the Saviour, the meeting[509]\non the mountain in Galilee, the parting scene upon Olivet, with the\nangel\u2019s promise, and the days of prayer and communion in the upper\nchamber.\nJesus, when preparing for some great trial or some important\nwork, would resort to the solitude of the mountains and spend the\nnight in prayer to His Father. A night of prayer preceded the ordina-\ntion of the apostles and the Sermon on the Mount, the transfiguration,\nthe agony of the judgment hall and the cross, and the resurrection\nglory.\nThe Privilege of Prayer\nWe, too, must have times set apart for meditation and prayer\nand for receiving spiritual refreshing. We do not value the power\nand efficacy of prayer as we should. Prayer and faith will do what\nno power on earth can accomplish. We are seldom, in all respects,\nplaced in the same position twice. We continually have new scenes\nand new trials to pass through, where past experience cannot be a\nsufficient guide. We must have the continual light that comes from\nGod.\nChrist is ever sending messages to those who listen for His voice.\nOn the night of the agony in Gethsemane, the sleeping disciples\nheard not the voice of Jesus. They had a dim sense of the angels\u2019\npresence, but lost the power and glory of the scene. Because of\ntheir drowsiness and stupor they failed of receiving the evidence that\nwould have strengthened their souls for the terrible scenes before\nthem. Thus today the very men who most need divine instruction\noften fail of receiving it, because they do not place themselves in\ncommunion with heaven.\nHigher Experience 359\nThe temptations to which we are daily exposed make prayer\na necessity. Dangers beset every path. Those who are seeking to [510]\nrescue others from vice and ruin are especially exposed to temptation.\nIn constant contact with evil, they need a strong hold upon God lest\nthey themselves be corrupted. Short and decisive are the steps that\nlead men down from high and holy ground to a low level. In a\nmoment decisions may be made that fix one\u2019s condition forever.\nOne failure to overcome leaves the soul unguarded. One evil habit,\nif not firmly resisted, will strengthen into chains of steel, binding\nthe whole man.\nThe reason why so many are left to themselves in places of\ntemptation is that they do not set the Lord always before them. When\nwe permit our communion with God to be broken, our defense is\ndeparted from us. Not all your good purposes and good intentions\nwill enable you to withstand evil. You must be men and women\nof prayer. Your petitions must not be faint, occasional, and fitful,\nbut earnest, persevering, and constant. It is not always necessary\nto bow upon your knees in order to pray. Cultivate the habit of\ntalking with the Saviour when you are alone, when you are walking, [511]\nand when you are busy with your daily labor. Let the heart be\ncontinually uplifted in silent petition for help, for light, for strength,\nfor knowledge. Let every breath be a prayer.\nAs workers for God we must reach men where they are, sur-\nrounded with darkness, sunken in vice, and stained with corruption.\nBut while we stay our minds upon Him who is our sun and our\nshield, the evil that surrounds us will not bring one stain upon our\ngarments. As we work to save the souls that are ready to perish we\nshall not be put to shame if we make God our trust. Christ in the\nheart, Christ in the life, this is our safety. The atmosphere of His\npresence will fill the soul with abhorrence of all that is evil. Our\nspirit may be so identified with His that in thought and aim we shall\nbe one with Him.\nIt was through faith and prayer that Jacob, from being a man of\nfeebleness and sin, became a prince with God. It is thus that you may\nbecome men and women of high and holy purpose, of noble life,\nmen and women who will not for any consideration be swayed from\ntruth, right, and justice. All are pressed with urgent cares, burdens,\n360 The Ministry of Healing\nand duties, but the more difficult your position and the heavier your\nburdens, the more you need Jesus.\nIt is a serious mistake to neglect the public worship of God. The\nprivileges of divine service should not be lightly regarded. Those\nwho attend upon the sick are often unable to avail themselves of\nthese privileges, but they should be careful not to absent themselves\nneedlessly from the house of worship.\nIn ministering to the sick, more than in any merely secular busi-\nness, success depends on the spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice\nwith which the work is done. Those who bear responsibilities need\nto place themselves where they will be deeply impressed by the[512]\nSpirit of God. You should have as much greater anxiety than do\nothers for the aid of the Holy Spirit and for a knowledge of God as\nyour position of trust is more responsible than that of others.\nNothing is more needed in our work than the practical results of\ncommunion with God. We should show by our daily lives that we\nhave peace and rest in the Saviour. His peace in the heart will shine\nforth in the countenance. It will give to the voice a persuasive power.\nCommunion with God will ennoble the character and the life. Men\nwill take knowledge of us, as of the first disciples, that we have been\nwith Jesus. This will impart to the worker a power that nothing else\ncan give. Of this power he must not allow himself to be deprived.\nWe must live a twofold life\u2014a life of thought and action, of\nsilent prayer and earnest work. The strength received through com-\nmunion with God, united with earnest effort in training the mind\nto thoughtfulness and caretaking, prepares one for daily duties and\nkeeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances, however trying.\nThe Divine Counselor\nWhen in trouble, many think they must appeal to some earthly\nfriend, telling him their perplexities, and begging for help. Under\ntrying circumstances unbelief fills their hearts, and the way seems\ndark. And all the time there stands beside them the mighty Counselor\nof the ages, inviting them to place their confidence in Him. Jesus,\nthe great Burden Bearer, is saying, \u201cCome unto Me, and I will give\nyou rest.\u201d Shall we turn from Him to uncertain human beings, who\nare as dependent upon God as we ourselves are?\nHigher Experience 361\nYou may feel the deficiency of your character and the smallness [513]\nof your ability in comparison with the greatness of the work. But\nif you had the greatest intellect ever given to man, it would not be\nsufficient for your work. \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing,\u201d says our\nLord and Saviour. John 15:5. The result of all we do rests in the\nhands of God. Whatever may betide, lay hold upon Him with steady,\npersevering confidence.\nIn your business, in companionship for leisure hours, and in\nalliance for life, let all the associations you form be entered upon\nwith earnest, humble prayer. You will thus show that you honor God,\nand God will honor you. Pray when you are fainthearted. When you\nare desponding, close the lips firmly to men; do not shadow the path\nof others; but tell everything to Jesus. Reach up your hands for help.\nIn your weakness lay hold of infinite strength. Ask for humility,\nwisdom, courage, increase of faith, that you may see light in God\u2019s\nlight and rejoice in His love.\nConsecration; Trust\nWhen we are humble and contrite we stand where God can and\nwill manifest Himself to us. He is well pleased when we urge past\nmercies and blessings as a reason why He should bestow on us\ngreater blessings. He will more than fulfill the expectations of those\nwho trust fully in Him. The Lord Jesus knows just what His children\nneed, how much divine power we will appropriate for the blessing\nof humanity; and He bestows upon us all that we will employ in\nblessing others and ennobling our own souls.\nWe must have less trust in what we ourselves can do, and more\ntrust in what the Lord can do for and through us. You are not engaged [514]\nin your own work; you are doing the work of God. Surrender\nyour will and way to Him. Make not a single reserve, not a single\ncompromise with self. Know what it is to be free in Christ.\nThe mere hearing of sermons Sabbath after Sabbath, the reading\nof the Bible through and through, or the explanation of it verse by\nverse, will not benefit us or those who hear us, unless we bring the\ntruths of the Bible into our individual experience. The understanding,\nthe will, the affections, must be yielded to the control of the word of\n362 The Ministry of Healing\nGod. Then through the work of the Holy Spirit the precepts of the\nword will become the principles of the life.\nAs you ask the Lord to help you, honor your Saviour by believing\nthat you do receive His blessing. All power, all wisdom, are at our\ncommand. We have only to ask.\nWalk continually in the light of God. Meditate day and night\nupon His character. Then you will see His beauty and rejoice in His\ngoodness. Your heart will glow with a sense of His love. You will\nbe uplifted as if borne by everlasting arms. With the power and light\nthat God imparts, you can comprehend more and accomplish more\nthan you ever before deemed possible.\n\u201cAbide in Me\u201d\nChrist bids us: \u201cAbide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot\nbear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except\nye abide in Me.... He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same\nbringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing.... If ye\nabide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will,\nand it shall be done unto you. Herein is My Father glorified, that ye\nbear much fruit; so shall ye be My disciples.\n\u201cAs the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you: continue ye\nin My love....\n\u201cYe have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and ordained\nyou, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should[515]\n[516] remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He\nmay give it you.\u201d John 15:4-16.\n\u201cBehold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My\nvoice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with\nhim, and he with Me.\u201d Revelation 3:20.\n\u201cTo him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna,\nand will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,\nwhich no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.\u201d Revelation 2:17.\n\u201cHe that overcometh, ... I will give him the Morning Star,\u201d \u201cand\nI will write upon him the name of My God, and the name of the city\nof My God: ... and I will write upon him My new name.\u201d Verses\n26-28; 3:12.\nHigher Experience 363\n\u201cThis One Thing I Do\u201d\nHe whose trust is in God will with Paul be able to say, \u201cI can\ndo all things in Him that strengtheneth me.\u201d Philippians 4:13, R.V .\nWhatever the mistakes or failures of the past, we may, with the help\nof God, rise above them. With the apostle we may say:\n\u201cThis one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind,\nand reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward\nthe mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d\nPhilippians 3:13, 14.",
