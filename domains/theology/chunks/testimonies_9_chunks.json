. . . . . . . 243\nThe Times of Volume Nine\nAs we look at the times of volume 9 we view a five-year span\nextending to the late summer of 1909. In Mrs. White\u2019s experience\nthis period is opened and closed with trips from her home in St.\nHelena, California, to the East to attend important meetings. For the\ndenomination it is a time of full recovery from the crisis of 1902-03\nand of extending the work, of launching new enterprises, and of\nestablishing new institutions.\nFollowing important meetings in Michigan in the spring of 1904,\nMrs. White visited the South and then made her way to Washington,\nD. C., where steps were being taken to provide buildings for the\nwork which was being established at the nation\u2019s capital. There was\na new headquarters building to be erected, the Review and Herald\nmust be provided with a home, a sanitarium was to be built, and\na college established. The fact that Mrs. White made her home\nin Washington for some months, where she could give counsel\nregarding the work, as these four enterprises were gotten under way,\nwas a great encouragement to the workers. It also exerted a far-\nreaching influence throughout the denomination in establishing the\nconfidence of the church members that God had led in the transfer\nof the administration and publishing interests to the nation\u2019s capital.\nThis was a period of rapid advancement in the development of\nour medical work on the Pacific Coast. Sanitariums were opened\nin National City, Glendale, and Loma Linda, California. From\nthe first, Loma Linda seemed destined to become a training center\nfor medical workers at some future time to do the work for the\ndenomination begun at Battle Creek. During the critical years of\nthe establishment of the medical college, Mrs. White made frequent\nvisits to Southern California, where she could give personal counsel\nand encouragement, and could assist in the laying of plans for the[4]\nadvancing work. It was utterances, based upon the revelations given\nher of God, that led us step by step eventually to the establishment\nof a fully recognized medical college. So insurmountable were the\nvi\nTimes of Volume Nine vii\nobstacles that, had it not been for the faith and confidence inspired\nby the frequent counsels which came through the spirit of prophecy,\nthe enterprise would never have survived.\nThese important interests that took Mrs. White much from her\nhome and her writing, resulted in a great delay in the issuance of\nbooks she hoped could soon be in the field doing their work. The\nMinistry of Healing was the only Ellen G. White book newly issued\nduring this five-year period.\nThe work of the denomination had by this time grown too large\nfor us to mention in detail the various advance steps. The mes-\nsage was now belting the globe, missionaries were being sent out in\nincreasing numbers, more institutions devoted to educational, pub-\nlishing, and medical interests were being established. The message\nwas truly reaching the ends of the earth.\nIt brought great rejoicing to the heart of Ellen White to meet\nwith the representatives of the world-wide work as they gathered in\nWashington, D. C., in the spring of 1909 for the General Conference\nsession. This was her last trip East\u2014this the last General Conference\nsession she attended. She was now eighty-one years of age and had\ngiven a long life of service to the cause of God. She had seen the\nwork grow from the struggling beginning days when there were\nonly a handful who kept the Sabbath and who looked for the soon\ncoming of the Lord. Now they numbered 85,000, and there were\n1,200 ordained and licensed ministers. As Ellen White stood before\nthe General Conference, she was led to speak on certain subjects of\ngreat importance which must be reviewed. Among these was health\nreform. For forty-five years she had led out in teaching the great [5]\nprinciples of healthful living which had been presented to her in\nvision. She had seen the fruitage of this teaching. However, there\nwere some who still held back, there were some who were inclined\nto extremes, and so she reviewed our position and teachings point\nby point. This statement made before the General Conference forms\nan important chapter of volume 9.\nAnother topic upon which she chose to speak was that of the\nmedical college of Loma Linda. She set forth the objectives of that\ninstitution and appealed for the co-operation of all workers and laity\nin making this work a success. This important statement is also a\npart of volume 9.\nviii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nMrs. White had seen the work of the administration of the\nchurch develop from a committee of three which was appointed\nin 1863 to take charge of the General Conference, to its present\nstatus of organization with General Conference departments and\nwith Division and Union Conference organizations dividing the\nresponsibilities among hundreds who carried the burden of the work\nin various parts of the world field. In her closing words she pleaded\nfor unity and consecration. In her written statements she dealt with\nthe authority of the General Conference and the importance of the\nactions taken by the General Conference in full session. She wrote\nof the distribution of responsibility and the need of humility and of\nfaith. These counsels form an important part of the closing section\nof volume 9.\nAt the turn of the century Mrs. White had begun to appeal for\na renewed interest in the evangelizing of the millions in the great\nmetropolitan centers of the world. These needs had been emphasized\nagain and again in the counsels which had been sent to the leading\nworkers. In response to these messages, interests in city work was\nrevived. Large centers were entered. Many evangelistic efforts\nwere held, old churches were strengthened, and new churches were\nestablished. To preserve the appeals for this work and the counsels[6]\nas to its conduct in permanent form, an entire section of volume 9 is\ndevoted to this important subject.\nWe were in days, too, when the various enterprises which were\nentered into called for the talents and energies of our lay members.\nIt began to be clear that this work could never be finished unless the\nlaity vigorously united with the ministry in carrying the message\nto the world. The work of laymen took on new importance. In the\nlast two volumes of the Testimonies increasing emphasis had been\nplaced upon the work of the laymen, and this is brought to a climax\nin volume 9. Following a picture of the last crisis and events to take\nplace in the closing scenes of earth\u2019s history, several chapters are\ndevoted to the call for every Seventh-day Adventist to take an active\npart in evangelism, in home missionary work, and in the circulation\nof literature.\nThere were two other lines of detailed counsel which are repre-\nsented in this volume for the first time in the Testimonies, though\nconsiderable instruction had been given through the years relating to\nTimes of Volume Nine ix\nthem. The first has to do with the work among the colored people.\nThe second has to do with the religious liberty work. It was largely\nin response to the appeals made by Ellen White in the articles in the\nReview in the middle nineties that workers and laymen pushed into\nthe great Southland and began their ministry, some in educational\nlines, some in medical lines, some in preaching the message, and\nothers in quietly living the message as homes were established in\nregions which had not yet received the light. Still others had joined\nin this work in response to the appeals in volume 7. The workers\nfaced many problems. Plans must be laid for advancement. New\nissues must be met, especially those relating to the work where there\nwas race antagonism. Through the critical years counsel had been\ngiven which served as safe guidance for the work, and to make this\ncounsel a permanent record to serve the church, it was included in [7]\nvolume 9.\nThe religious liberty work was a line of endeavor in which we had\nbeen engaged for many years. Some were inclined to take extreme\npositions urging that true Sabbathkeeping meant that one must make\nit prominent to those about him that we labored on Sunday. In\nsome regions this led to persecution. The Lord in his goodness sent\nmessages to this people to give us a balanced conception of questions\nof this kind. These, too, appear in this volume in the section entitled,\n\u201cThe Religious Liberty Work,\u201d opening with the chapter, \u201cA Time of\nTrial Before Us,\u201d and closing with the chapter, \u201cWords of Caution.\u201d\nSo volume 9, drawing together counsels new and old, reiterating\ncertain lines of instruction, giving details of counsel in other lines,\nencouraging to service, pointing out the dangers of extremes, leading\nto confidence in organization and pointing to the reward of earnest\neffort, became the cap-sheaf of the Testimonies for the Church.\nThe work of Ellen White did not close with the issuance of\nTestimonies for the Church, V olume 9. Addressing herself more\nclosely to her work of book preparation during the succeeding five\nyears, she brought out Acts of the Apostles in 1911 and Counsels\nto Parents, Teachers, and Studentsin 1913. She also did her final\nwork on manuscripts for the new edition ofGospel Workers and Life\nSketches, published in 1915, and Prophets and Kings, which came\nfrom the press in 1916.\nx Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nEspecially did she take delight in the special efforts which were\nmade to warn the cities, and from time to time there came from her\npen messages of counsel and instruction regarding this important\nphase of our work. The steady progress of the cause around the\nworld was marked by this now aging messenger of the Lord residing\namong the quiet hills of northern California. Although she knew her\nlabors were nearly finished, she had no fears for the future of the[8]\nwork of God, for as she stated: \u201cwhether or not my life is spared, my\nwritings will constantly speak, and their work will go forward as long\nas time shall last.\u201d\u2014Writing and Sending out of the \u201cTestimonies\nfor the Church,\u201d Pages 13, 14.\nAs plans were laid for the General Conference session of 1913,\nMrs. White would have been pleased to have attended, but in her\nadvancing age this seemed inadvisable. Not being able to present\nan oral message, she wrote two communications to be read to the\ndelegates and church members assembled. In the second message,\nwhich was read by the president of the General Conference to the\nconference in session on the morning of May 27, she reviewed the\nexperience of past years, and rejoiced in the marked evidences that\nGod had led his people. Then, looking ahead, she called for renewed\nefforts in soul-saving work and appealed again for the unwarned\ncities. Looking into the future she saw the triumph of the church\nand expressed words of courage:\n\u201cI have words of encouragement for you, my brethren. We are\nto move forward in faith and hope, expecting large things from God.\nThe enemy will seek in every way to hinder the efforts that are being\nmade to advance the truth, but in the strength of the Lord you may\ngain success. Let no discouraging words be spoken, but only such\nwords as will tend to strengthen and sustain your fellow workers....\n\u201cMy interest in the general work is still as deep as ever and I\ngreatly desire that the cause of present truth shall steadily advance\nin all parts of the world....\n\u201cI pray earnestly that the work we do at this time shall impress\nitself deeply on heart and mind and soul. Perplexities will increase;\nbut let us, as believers in God, encourage one another. Let us not\nlower the standard, but keep it lifted high, looking to him who is the\nauthor and finisher of our faith. When in the night season I am unable\nto sleep, I lift my heart in prayer to God, and he strengthens me, and[9]\nTimes of Volume Nine xi\ngives me the assurance that he is with his ministering servants in the\nhome field and in distant lands. I am encouraged and blessed as I\nrealize that the God of Israel is still guiding his people, and that he\nwill continue to be with them, even to the end....\n\u201cThe Lord desires to see the work of proclaiming the third an-\ngel\u2019s message carried forward with increasing efficiency. As he has\nworked in all ages to give victories to his people, so in this age he\nlongs to carry to a triumphant fulfillment his purposes for his church.\nHe bids his believing saints to advance unitedly, going from strength\nto greater strength, from faith to increased assurance and confidence\nin the truth and righteousness of his cause.\n\u201cWe are to stand firm as a rock to the principles of the word of\nGod, remembering that God is with us to give us strength to meet\neach new experience. Let us ever maintain in our lives the principles\nof righteousness, that we may go forward from strength to strength\nin the name of the Lord. We are to hold as very sacred the faith\nthat has been substantiated by the instruction and approval of the\nSpirit of God from our earliest experience until the present time.\nWe are to cherish as very precious the work that the Lord has been\ncarrying forward through His commandment-keeping people, and\nwhich, through the power of His grace, will grow stronger and more\nefficient as time advances. The enemy is seeking to becloud the\ndiscernment of God\u2019s people, and to weaken their efficiency, but if\nthey will labor as the Spirit of God shall direct, He will open doors\nof opportunity before them for the work of building up the old waste\nplaces. Their experience will be one of constant growth, until the\nLord shall descend from heaven with power and great glory to set\nHis seal of final triumph upon His faithful ones.\n\u201cThe work that lies before us is one that will put to the stretch [10]\nevery power of the human being. It will call for the exercise of\nstrong faith and constant vigilance. At times the difficulties that we\nshall meet will be most disheartening. The very greatness of the task\nwill appall us. And yet, with God\u2019s help, his servants will finally\ntriumph.\u201d-Reported in the General Conference Bulletin, May 28,\n1913, 164, 165.\nIn the times of the nine volumes of Testimonies for the Church\nwritten over a period of fifty-five years the church continually grew\nand developed and prospered. The counsel given afforded safe\nxii Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nguidance, the reproof and correction led many straying feet back to\nthe paths of righteousness, the words of cheer and encouragement\nrevived many a faint heart, and the picture of the reward of the\nfaithful spurred thousands to the determination to reach the goal set\nbefore us.\nLooking ahead, we must ever remember the words recorded in\nLife Sketches of Ellen G. White, 196:\n\u201cWe have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget\nthe way the Lord has led us, and his teaching in our past history.\u201d\nThe Trustees of the\nEllen G. White Publications.\nSection 1\u2014For the Coming of the King [11]\n\u201cYet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not\ntarry. \u201d Hebrews 10:37.\nChapter 1\u2014The Last Crisis\nWe are living in the time of the end. The fast-fulfilling signs of\nthe times declare that the coming of Christ is near at hand. The days\nin which we live are solemn and important. The Spirit of God is\ngradually but surely being withdrawn from the earth. Plagues and\njudgments are already falling upon the despisers of the grace of God.\nThe calamities by land and sea, the unsettled state of society, the\nalarms of war, are portentous. They forecast approaching events of\nthe greatest magnitude.\nThe agencies of evil are combining their forces and consolidating.\nThey are strengthening for the last great crisis. Great changes are\nsoon to take place in our world, and the final movements will be\nrapid ones.\nThe condition of things in the world shows that troublous times\nare right upon us. The daily papers are full of indications of a terrible\nconflict in the near future. Bold robberies are of frequent occurrence.\nStrikes are common. Thefts and murders are committed on every\nhand. Men possessed of demons are taking the lives of men, women,\nand little children. Men have become infatuated with vice, and every\nspecies of evil prevails.\nThe enemy has succeeded in perverting justice and in filling\nmen\u2019s hearts with the desire for selfish gain. \u201cJustice standeth afar[12]\noff: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.\u201d Isaiah\n59:14. In the great cities there are multitudes living in poverty\nand wretchedness, well-nigh destitute of food, shelter, and clothing;\nwhile in the same cities are those who have more than heart could\nwish, who live luxuriously, spending their money on richly furnished\nhouses, on personal adornment, or worse still, upon the gratification\nof sensual appetites, upon liquor, tobacco, and other things that\ndestroy the powers of the brain, unbalance the mind, and debase\nthe soul. The cries of starving humanity are coming up before God,\nwhile by every species of oppression and extortion men are piling\nup colossal fortunes.\n14\nLast Crisis 15\nOn one occasion, when in New York City, I was in the night\nseason called upon to behold buildings rising story after story toward\nheaven. These buildings were warranted to be fireproof, and they\nwere erected to glorify their owners and builders. Higher and still\nhigher these buildings rose, and in them the most costly material\nwas used. Those to whom these buildings belonged were not asking\nthemselves: \u201cHow can we best glorify God?\u201d The Lord was not in\ntheir thoughts.\nI thought: \u201cOh, that those who are thus investing their means\ncould see their course as God sees it! They are piling up magnificent\nbuildings, but how foolish in the sight of the Ruler of the universe\nis their planning and devising. They are not studying with all the\npowers of heart and mind how they may glorify God. They have lost\nsight of this, the first duty of man.\u201d\nAs these lofty buildings went up, the owners rejoiced with ambi-\ntious pride that they had money to use in gratifying self and provok-\ning the envy of their neighbors. Much of the money that they thus\ninvested had been obtained through exaction, through grinding down [13]\nthe poor. They forgot that in heaven an account of every business\ntransaction is kept; every unjust deal, every fraudulent act, is there\nrecorded. The time is coming when in their fraud and insolence men\nwill reach a point that the Lord will not permit them to pass, and\nthey will learn that there is a limit to the forbearance of Jehovah.\nThe scene that next passed before me was an alarm of fire. Men\nlooked at the lofty and supposedly fire-proof buildings and said:\n\u201cThey are perfectly safe.\u201d But these buildings were consumed as\nif made of pitch. The fire engines could do nothing to stay the\ndestruction. The firemen were unable to operate the engines.\nI am instructed that when the Lord\u2019s time comes, should no\nchange have taken place in the hearts of proud, ambitious human\nbeings, men will find that the hand that had been strong to save will\nbe strong to destroy. No earthly power can stay the hand of God. No\nmaterial can be used in the erection of buildings that will preserve\nthem from destruction when God\u2019s appointed time comes to send\nretribution on men for their disregard of His law and for their selfish\nambition.\nThere are not many, even among educators and statesmen, who\ncomprehend the causes that underlie the present state of society.\n16 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nThose who hold the reins of government are not able to solve the\nproblem of moral corruption, poverty, pauperism, and increasing\ncrime. They are struggling in vain to place business operations on a\nmore secure basis. If men would give more heed to the teaching of\nGod\u2019s word, they would find a solution of the problems that perplex\nthem.\nThe Scriptures describe the condition of the world just before\nChrist\u2019s second coming. Of the men who by robbery and extortion[14]\nare amassing great riches, it is written: \u201cYe have heaped treasure\ntogether for the last days. Behold, the hire of the laborers who have\nreaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth:\nand the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears\nof the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and\nbeen wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.\nYe have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist you.\u201d\nJames 5:3-6.\nBut who reads the warnings given by the fast-fulfilling signs of\nthe times? What impression is made upon worldlings? What change\nis seen in their attitude? No more than was seen in the attitude of the\ninhabitants of the Noachian world. Absorbed in worldly business\nand pleasure, the antediluvians \u201cknew not until the Flood came,\nand took them all away.\u201d Matthew 24:39. They had heaven-sent\nwarnings, but they refused to listen. And today the world, utterly\nregardless of the warning voice of God, is hurrying on to eternal\nruin.\nThe world is stirred with the spirit of war. The prophecy of the\neleventh chapter of Daniel has nearly reached its complete fulfill-\nment. Soon the scenes of trouble spoken of in the prophecies will\ntake place.\n\u201cBehold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,\nand turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants\nthereof.... Because they have transgressed the laws, changed the\nordinance, broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore hath the curse\ndevoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate.... The\nmirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the\njoy of the harp ceaseth.\u201d Isaiah 24:1-8.\n\u201cAlas for the day! for the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a[15]\ndestruction from the Almighty shall it come.... The seed is rotten\nLast Crisis 17\nunder their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken\ndown, for the corn is withered. How do the beasts groan! the herds\nof cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks\nof sheep are made desolate.\u201d \u201cThe vine is dried up, and the fig tree\nlanguisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple\ntree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is\nwithered away from the sons of men.\u201d Joel 1:15-18, 12.\n\u201cI am pained at my very heart; ... I cannot hold my peace,\nbecause thou has heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the\nalarm of war. Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole\nland is spoiled.\u201d Jeremiah 4:19, 20.\n\u201cI beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and\nthe heavens, and they had no light. I beheld the mountains, and, lo,\nthey trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. I beheld, and, lo, there\nwas no man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled. I beheld,\nand, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof\nwere broken down.\u201d Verses 23-26.\n\u201cAlas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the\ntime of Jacob\u2019s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.\u201d Jeremiah\n30:7.\nNot all in this world have taken sides with the enemy against God.\nNot all have become disloyal. There are a faithful few who are true\nto God; for John writes: \u201cHere are they that keep the commandments\nof God, and the faith of Jesus.\u201d Revelation 14:12. Soon the battle\nwill be waged fiercely between those who serve God and those who\nserve Him not. Soon everything that can be shaken will be shaken,\nthat those things that cannot be shaken may remain. [16]\nSatan is a diligent Bible student. He knows that his time is short,\nand he seeks at every point to counterwork the work of the Lord upon\nthis earth. It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the\npeople of God who shall be alive upon the earth when celestial glory\nand a repetition of the persecutions of the past are blended. They\nwill walk in the light proceeding from the throne of God. By means\nof the angels there will be constant communication between heaven\nand earth. And Satan, surrounded by evil angels, and claiming to be\nGod, will work miracles of all kinds, to deceive, if possible, the very\nelect. God\u2019s people will not find their safety in working miracles,\nfor Satan will counterfeit the miracles that will be wrought. God\u2019s\n18 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\ntried and tested people will find their power in the sign spoken of in\nExodus 31:12-18. They are to take their stand on the living word:\n\u201cIt is written.\u201d This is the only foundation upon which they can stand\nsecurely. Those who have broken their covenant with God will in\nthat day be without God and without hope.\nThe worshipers of God will be especially distinguished by their\nregard for the fourth commandment, since this is the sign of God\u2019s\ncreative power and the witness to His claim upon man\u2019s reverence\nand homage. The wicked will be distinguished by their efforts to tear\ndown the Creator\u2019s memorial and to exalt the institution of Rome.\nIn the issue of the conflict all Christendom will be divided into two\ngreat classes, those who keep the commandments of God and the\nfaith of Jesus, and those who worship the beast and his image, and\nreceive his mark. Although church and state will unite their power to\ncompel all, \u201cboth small and great, rich and poor, free and bond,\u201d to\nreceive the mark of the beast, yet the people of God will not receive[17]\nit. Revelation 13:16. The prophet of Patmos beholds \u201cthem that had\ngotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his\nmark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass,\nhaving the harps of God,\u201d and singing the song of Moses and the\nLamb. Revelation 15:2.\nFearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit of war\nis stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in\nthe midst of the time of trouble that is coming,\u2014a time of trouble\nsuch as has not been since there was a nation,\u2014God\u2019s chosen people\nwill stand unmoved. Satan and his host cannot destroy them, for\nangels that excel in strength will protect them.\n* * * * *\nGod\u2019s word to His people is: \u201cCome out from among them,\nand be ye separate, ... and touch not the unclean thing; and I will\nreceive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons\nand daughters.\u201d \u201cYe are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an\nholy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises\nof Him who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous\nlight.\u201d 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18; 1 Peter 2:9. God\u2019s people are to\nbe distinguished as a people who serve Him fully, wholeheartedly,\nLast Crisis 19\ntaking no honor to themselves, and remembering that by a most\nsolemn covenant they have bound themselves to serve the Lord and\nHim only.\n\u201cThe Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto the\nchildren of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it\nis a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye\nmay know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep [18]\nthe Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: everyone that defileth\nit shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein,\nthat soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days may work\nbe done; but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord:\nwhosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put\nto death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath,\nto observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant. It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever:\nfor in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh\nday He rested, and was refreshed.\u201d Exodus 31:12-17.\nDo not these words point us out as God\u2019s denominated people?\nand do they not declare to us that so long as time shall last, we are\nto cherish the sacred, denominational distinction placed upon us?\nThe children of Israel were to observe the Sabbath throughout their\ngenerations \u201cfor a perpetual covenant.\u201d The Sabbath has lost none\nof its meaning. It is still the sign between God and His people, and\nit will be so forever.\nChapter 2\u2014Called to Be Witnesses[19]\nIn a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in the\nworld as watchmen and light bearers. To them has been entrusted\nthe last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining wonderful\nlight from the word of God. They have been given a work of the\nmost solemn import\u2014the proclamation of the first, second, and third\nangels\u2019 messages. There is no other work of so great importance.\nThey are to allow nothing else to absorb their attention.\nThe most solemn truths ever entrusted to mortals have been given\nus to proclaim to the world. The proclamation of these truths is to\nbe our work. The world is to be warned, and God\u2019s people are to\nbe true to the trust committed to them. They are not to engage in\nspeculation, neither are they to enter into business enterprises with\nunbelievers; for this would hinder them in their God-given work.\nChrist says of His people: \u201cYe are the light of the world.\u201d\nMatthew 5:14. It is not a small matter that the counsels and plans of\nGod have been so clearly opened to us. It is a wonderful privilege to\nbe able to understand the will of God as revealed in the sure word\nof prophecy. This places on us a heavy responsibility. God expects\nus to impart to others the knowledge that He has given us. It is His\npurpose that divine and human instrumentalities shall unite in the\nproclamation of the warning message.\nSo far as his opportunities extend, everyone who has received\nthe light of truth is under the same responsibility as was the prophet\nof Israel to whom came the word: \u201cSon of man, I have set thee a\nwatchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the[20]\nword at My mouth, and warn them from Me. When I say unto the\nwicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak\nto warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his\niniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if\nthou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn\nfrom his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy\nsoul.\u201d Ezekiel 33:7-9.\n20\nCalled to Be Witnesses 21\nAre we to wait until the fulfillment of the prophecies of the end\nbefore we say anything concerning them? Of what value will our\nwords be then? Shall we wait until God\u2019s judgments fall upon the\ntransgressor before we tell him how to avoid them? Where is our\nfaith in the word of God? Must we see things foretold come to pass\nbefore we will believe what He has said? In clear, distinct rays light\nhas come to us, showing us that the great day of the Lord is near at\nhand, \u201ceven at the doors.\u201d Let us read and understand before it is too\nlate.\nWe are to be consecrated channels, through which the heavenly\nlife is to flow to others. The Holy Spirit is to animate and pervade\nthe whole church, purifying and cementing hearts. Those who have\nbeen buried with Christ in baptism are to rise to newness of life,\ngiving a living representation of the life of Christ. Upon us is laid a\nsacred charge. The commission has been given us: \u201cGo ye therefore,\nand make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the\nFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to\nobserve all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am\nwith you always even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:19,\n20, margin. You are dedicated to the work of making known the\ngospel of salvation. Heaven\u2019s perfection is to be your power. [21]\nA Holy Life\nIt is not only by preaching the truth, not only by distributing\nliterature, that we are to witness for God. Let us remember that a\nChristlike life is the most powerful argument that can be advanced\nin favor of Christianity, and that a cheap Christian character works\nmore harm in the world than the character of a worldling. Not all\nthe books written can serve the purpose of a holy life. Men will\nbelieve, not what the minister preaches, but what the church lives.\nToo often the influence of the sermon preached from the pulpit is\ncounteracted by the sermon preached in the lives of those who claim\nto be advocates of truth.\nIt is the purpose of God to glorify Himself in His people before\nthe world. He expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent\nHim in thought, word, and deed. Their thoughts are to be pure and\ntheir words noble and uplifting, drawing those around them nearer\n22 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthe Saviour. The religion of Christ is to be interwoven with all that\nthey do and say. Their every business transaction is to be fragrant\nwith the presence of God.\nSin is a hateful thing. It marred the moral beauty of a large\nnumber of the angels. It entered our world and well-nigh obliterated\nthe moral image of God in man. But in His great love, God provided\na way whereby man might regain the position from which he fell in\nyielding to the tempter. Christ came to stand at the head of humanity,\nto work out in our behalf a perfect character. Those who receive\nHim are born again.\nChrist saw humanity, through the working of the mighty growth\nof sin, possessed by the prince of the power of the air and putting[22]\nforth gigantic strength in exploits of evil. He saw also that a mightier\npower was to meet and conquer Satan. \u201cNow is the judgment of this\nworld,\u201d He said, \u201cnow shall the prince of this world be cast out.\u201d\nJohn 12:31. He saw that if human beings believed on Him, they\nwould be given power against the host of fallen angels, whose name\nis legion. Christ strengthened His soul with the thought that, by the\nwonderful sacrifice which He was about to make, the prince of this\nworld was to be cast out and men and women placed where, through\nthe grace of God, they could regain what they had lost.\nThe life that Christ lived in this world, men and women can live\nthrough His power and under His instruction. In their conflict with\nSatan they may have all the help that He had. They may be more\nthan conquerors through Him who loved them and gave Himself for\nthem.\nThe lives of professing Christians who do not live the Christ life\nare a mockery to religion. Everyone whose name is registered on\nthe church roll is under obligation to represent Christ by revealing\nthe inward adorning of a meek and quiet spirit. They are to be His\nwitnesses, making known the advantages of walking and working as\nChrist has given them example. The truth for this time is to appear\nin its power in the lives of those who believe it, and is to be imparted\nto the world. Believers are to represent in their lives its power to\nsanctify and ennoble.\nCalled to Be Witnesses 23\nChrist\u2019s Representatives\nThe inhabitants of the heavenly universe expect the followers\nof Christ to shine as lights in the world. They are to show forth\nthe power of the grace that Christ died to give men. God expects\nthose who profess to be Christians to reveal in their lives the highest [23]\ndevelopment of Christianity. They are recognized representatives of\nChrist, and they are to show that Christianity is a reality. They are to\nbe men of faith, men of courage, whole-souled men, who, without\nquestioning, trust in God and His promises.\nAll who would enter the city of God must during their earthly\nlife set forth Christ in their dealings. It is this that constitutes them\nthe messengers of Christ, His witnesses. They are to bear a plain,\ndecided testimony against all evil practices, pointing sinners to the\nLamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world. He gives to all\nwho receive Him, power to become the sons of God. Regeneration is\nthe only path by which we can enter the city of God. It is narrow, and\nthe gate by which we enter is strait; but along it we are to lead men\nand women and children, teaching them that, in order to be saved,\nthey must have a new heart and a new spirit. The old, hereditary\ntraits of character must be overcome. The natural desires of the soul\nmust be changed. All deception, all falsifying, all evilspeaking, must\nbe put away. The new life, which makes men and women Christlike,\nis to be lived.\nSteadfast Adherence to the Truth\nThere must be no pretense in the lives of those who have so\nsacred and solemn a message as we have been called to bear. The\nworld is watching Seventh-day Adventists because it knows some-\nthing of their profession of faith and of their high standard, and when\nit sees those who do not live up to their profession, it points at them\nwith scorn.\nThose who love Jesus will bring all in their lives into harmony\nwith His will. They have chosen to be on the Lord\u2019s side, and their [24]\nlives are to stand out in vivid contrast with the lives of worldlings.\nThe tempter will come to them with his blandishments and bribes,\nsaying: \u201cAll this will I give thee if thou wilt worship me.\u201d But they\n24 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nknow that he has nothing worth receiving, and they refuse to yield\nto his temptations. Through the grace of God they are enabled to\nkeep their purity of principle unsullied. Holy angels are close beside\nthem, and Christ is revealed in their steadfast adherence to the truth.\nThey are Christ\u2019s minutemen, bearing, as true witnesses, a decided\ntestimony in favor of the truth. They show that there is a spiritual\npower that can enable men and women not to swerve an inch from\ntruth and justice for all the gifts that men can bestow. Such ones,\nwherever they may be, will be honored of heaven because they have\nconformed their lives to the will of God, caring not what sacrifices\nthey are called upon to make.\nA World-Wide Message\nThe light that God has given His people is not to be shut up\nwithin the churches that already know the truth. It is to be shed\nabroad into the dark places of the earth. Those who walk in the light\nas Christ is in the light will co-operate with the Saviour by revealing\nto others what He has revealed to them. It is God\u2019s purpose that\nthe truth for this time shall be made known to every kindred and\nnation and tongue and people. In the world today men and women\nare absorbed in the search for worldly gain and worldly pleasure.\nThere are thousands upon thousands who give no time or thought to\nthe salvation of the soul. The time has come when the message of\nChrist\u2019s soon coming is to sound throughout the world.\nUnmistakable evidences point to the nearness of the end. The[25]\nwarning is to be given in certain tones. The way must be prepared for\nthe coming of the Prince of Peace in the clouds of heaven. There is\nmuch to be done in the cities that have not yet heard the truth for this\ntime. We are not to establish institutions to rival in size and splendor\nthe institutions of the world; but in the name of the Lord, with the\nuntiring perseverance and unflagging zeal that Christ brought into\nHis labors, we are to carry forward the work of the Lord.\nAs a people we greatly need to humble our hearts before God,\npleading His forgiveness for our neglect to fulfill the gospel commis-\nsion. We have made large centers in a few places, leaving unworked\nmany important cities. Let us now take up the work appointed us\nand proclaim the message that is to arouse men and women to a\nCalled to Be Witnesses 25\nsense of their danger. If every Seventh-day Adventist had done the\nwork laid upon him, the number of believers would now be much\nlarger than it is. In all the cities of America there would be those\nwho had been led to heed the message to obey the Law of God.\nIn some places the message regarding the observance of the\nSabbath has been set forth with clearness and power, while other\nplaces have been left without warning. Will not those who know the\ntruth awake to the responsibilities resting upon them? My brethren,\nyou cannot afford to bury yourselves in worldly enterprises or inter-\nests. You cannot afford to neglect the commission given you by the\nSaviour.\nEverything in the universe calls upon those who know the truth\nto consecrate themselves unreservedly to the proclamation of the\ntruth as it has been made known to them in the third angel\u2019s message.\nThat which we see and hear calls us to our duty. The working of\nsatanic agencies calls every Christian to stand in his lot. [26]\nThe Kind of Workers Needed\nThe work given us is a great and important one, and in it are\nneeded wise, unselfish men, men who understand what it means to\ngive themselves to unselfish effort to save souls. But there is no\nneed for the service of men who are lukewarm, for such men Christ\ncannot use. Men and women are needed whose hearts are touched\nwith human suffering and whose lives give evidence that they are\nreceiving and imparting light and life and grace.\nThe people of God are to come close to Christ in self-denial and\nsacrifice, their one aim being to give the message of mercy to all\nthe world. Some will work in one way and some in another, as the\nLord shall call and lead them. But they are all to strive together,\nseeking to make the work a perfect whole. With pen and voice they\nare to labor for Him. The printed word of truth is to be translated\ninto different languages and carried to the ends of the earth.\nMy heart is often burdened because so many who might work\nare doing nothing. They are the sport of Satan\u2019s temptations. Every\nchurch member who has a knowledge of the truth is expected to\nwork while the day lasts; for the night cometh, wherein no man\ncan work. Erelong we shall understand what that night means. The\n26 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nSpirit of God is being grieved away from the earth. The nations are\nangry with one another. Widespread preparations are being made\nfor war. The night is at hand. Let the church arouse and go forth to\ndo her appointed work. Every believer, educated or uneducated, can\nbear the message.\nEternity stretches before us. The curtain is about to be lifted.[27]\nWhat are we thinking of, that we cling to our selfish love of ease,\nwhile all around us souls are perishing? Have our hearts become\nutterly callous? Can we not see and understand that we have a work\nto do in behalf of others? My brethren and sisters, are you among\nthose who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not? Is it in\nvain that God has given you a knowledge of His will? Is it in vain\nthat He has sent you warning after warning of the nearness of the\nend? Do you believe the declarations of His word concerning what\nis coming upon the world? Do you believe that God\u2019s judgments are\nhanging over the inhabitants of the earth? How, then, can you sit at\nease, careless and indifferent?\nEvery day that passes brings us nearer the end. Does it bring us\nalso near to God? Are we watching unto prayer? Those with whom\nwe associate day by day need our help, our guidance. They may be\nin such a condition of mind that a word in season will be sent home\nby the Holy Spirit as a nail in a sure place. Tomorrow some of these\nsouls may be where we can never reach them again. What is our\ninfluence over these fellow travelers? What effort do we make to\nwin them to Christ?\nTime is short, and our forces must be organized to do a larger\nwork. Laborers are needed who comprehend the greatness of the\nwork and who will engage in it, not for the wages they receive, but\nfrom a realization of the nearness of the end. The time demands\ngreater efficiency and deeper consecration. Oh, I am so full of this\nsubject that I cry to God: \u201cRaise up and send forth messengers filled\nwith a sense of their responsibility, messengers in whose hearts self-\nidolatry, which lies at the foundation of all sin, has been crucified.\u201d\nAn Impressive Scene[28]\nIn the visions of the night a very impressive scene passed before\nme. I saw an immense ball of fire fall among some beautiful man-\nCalled to Be Witnesses 27\nsions, causing their instant destruction. I heard someone say: \u201cWe\nknew that the judgments of God were coming upon the earth, but we\ndid not know that they would come so soon.\u201d Others, with agonized\nvoices, said: \u201cYou knew! Why then did you not tell us? We did not\nknow.\u201d On every side I heard similar words of reproach spoken.\nIn great distress I awoke. I went to sleep again, and I seemed\nto be in a large gathering. One of authority was addressing the\ncompany, before whom was spread out a map of the world. He said\nthat the map pictured God\u2019s vineyard, which must be cultivated. As\nlight from heaven shone upon anyone, that one was to reflect the\nlight to others. Lights were to be kindled in many places, and from\nthese lights still other lights were to be kindled.\nThe words were repeated: \u201cYe are the salt of the earth: but if the\nsalt have lost his savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth\ngood for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden underfoot of\nmen. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot\nbe hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but\non a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let\nyour light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,\nand glorify your Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 5:13-16.\nI saw jets of light shining from cities and villages, and from\nthe high places and the low places of the earth. God\u2019s word was\nobeyed, and as a result there were memorials for Him in every city [29]\nand village. His truth was proclaimed throughout the world.\nThen this map was removed and another put in its place. On\nit light was shining from a few places only. The rest of the world\nwas in darkness, with only a glimmer of light here and there. Our\nInstructor said: \u201cThis darkness is the result of men\u2019s following\ntheir own course. They have cherished hereditary and cultivated\ntendencies to evil. They have made questioning and faultfinding and\naccusing the chief business of their lives. Their hearts are not right\nwith God. They have hidden their light under a bushel.\u201d\nIf every soldier of Christ had done his duty, if every watchman\non the walls of Zion had given the trumpet a certain sound, the world\nmight ere this have heard the message of warning. But the work is\nyears behind. While men have slept, Satan has stolen a march upon\nus.\n28 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\n* * * * *\nPutting our trust in God, we are to move steadily forward, do-\ning His work with unselfishness, in humble dependence upon Him,\ncommitting ourselves and our present and future to His wise provi-\ndence, holding the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end,\nremembering that it is not because of our worthiness that we receive\nthe blessings of heaven, but because of the worthiness of Christ, and\nour acceptance, through faith in Him, of God\u2019s abounding grace.\nChapter 3\u2014Home Missionary Work [30]\nGod expects personal service from everyone to whom He has\nentrusted a knowledge of the truth for this time. Not all can go as\nmissionaries to foreign lands, but all can be home missionaries in\ntheir families and neighborhoods. There are many ways in which\nchurch members may give the message to those around them. One\nof the most successful is by living helpful, unselfish, Christian lives.\nThose who are fighting the battle of life at great odds may be re-\nfreshed and strengthened by little attentions which cost nothing.\nKindly words simply spoken, little attentions simply bestowed, will\nsweep away the clouds of temptation and doubt that gather over the\nsoul. The true heart expression of Christlike sympathy, given in\nsimplicity, has power to open the door of hearts that need the simple,\ndelicate touch of the spirit of Christ.\nChrist accepts, oh, so gladly! every human agency that is surren-\ndered to Him. He brings the human into union with the divine, that\nHe may communicate to the world the mysteries of incarnate love.\nTalk it, pray it, sing it, fill the world with the message of His truth,\nand keep pressing on into the regions beyond.\nHeavenly intelligences are waiting to co-operate with human\ninstrumentalities, that they may reveal to the world what human\nbeings may become and what, through their influence, they may\naccomplish for the saving of souls that are ready to perish. He who\nis truly converted will be so filled with the love of God that he will\nlong to impart to others the joy that he himself possesses. The Lord\ndesires His church to show forth to the world the beauty of holiness.\nShe is to demonstrate the power of Christian religion. Heaven is to [31]\nbe reflected in the character of the Christian. The song of gratitude\nand praise is to be heard by those in darkness. For the good tidings\nof the gospel, for its promises and assurances, we are to express our\ngratitude by seeking to do others good. The doing of this work will\nbring rays of heavenly righteousness to wearied, perplexed, suffering\n29\n30 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nsouls. It is as a fountain opened for the wayworn, thirsty traveler. At\nevery work of mercy, every work of love, angels of God are present.\nOur Example\nChrist\u2019s work is to be our example. Constantly He went about\ndoing good. In the temple and the synagogues, in the streets of\nthe cities, in the marketplace and the workshop, by the seaside and\namong the hills, He preached the gospel and healed the sick. His\nlife was one of unselfish service, and it is to be our lessonbook. His\ntender, pitying love rebukes our selfishness and heartlessness.\nWherever Christ went, He scattered blessings in His path. How\nmany who claim to believe on Him have learned His lessons of\nkindness, of tender pity, of unselfish love? Hear His voice speaking\nto the weak, the weary, the helpless: \u201cCome unto Me, all ye that\nlabor and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d Matthew 11:28.\nThere was no wearying of His patience, no repressing of His love.\nChrist calls upon us to labor patiently and perseveringly for the\nthousands perishing in their sins, scattered in all lands, like wrecks\non a desert shore. Those who share in Christ\u2019s glory must share also\nin His ministry, helping the weak, the wretched, and the despondent.\nLet those who take up this work make the life of Christ their con-[32]\nstant study. Let them be intensely in earnest, using every capability\nin the Lord\u2019s service. Precious results will follow sincere, unselfish\neffort. From the Great Teacher the workers will receive the highest\nof all education. But those who do not impart the light they have\nreceived will one day realize that they have sustained a fearful loss.\nHuman beings have no right to think that there is a limit to\nthe efforts that they are to make in the work of soulsaving. Did\nChrist ever become weary in His work? Did He ever draw back\nfrom sacrifice and hardship? Church members are to put forth the\ncontinuous, persevering efforts that He put forth. They are to be ever\nready to spring into action in obedience to the Master\u2019s commands.\nWherever we see work waiting to be done we are to take it up and\ndo it, constantly looking unto Jesus. If our church members would\nheed this instruction, hundreds of souls would be won to Jesus. If\nevery church member were a living missionary, the gospel would\nHome Missionary Work 31\nspeedily be proclaimed in all countries, to all peoples, nations, and\ntongues.\nThe Result of Wholehearted Effort\nLet sanctified ability be brought into the work of proclaiming\nthe truth for this time. If the forces of the enemy gain the victory\nnow, it will be because the churches neglect their God-given work.\nFor years the work has been kept before us, but many have been\nasleep. If Seventh-day Adventists will now arouse and do the work\nassigned them, the truth will be presented to our neglected cities in\nclear, distinct lines and in the power of the Spirit.\nWhen wholehearted work is done, the efficacy of the grace of [33]\nChrist will be seen. The watchmen on the walls of Zion are to be\nwide awake, and they are to arouse others. God\u2019s people are to be\nso earnest and faithful in their work for Him that all selfishness will\nbe separated from their lives. His workers will then see eye to eye,\nand the arm of the Lord, the power of which was seen in the life of\nChrist, will be revealed. Confidence will be restored, and there will\nbe unity in the churches throughout our ranks.\nDifferent Lines of Service\nThe Lord is calling upon His people to take up different lines\nof work. Those in the highways and byways of life are to hear the\ngospel message. Church members are to do evangelistic work in the\nhomes of their neighbors who have not yet received full evidence of\nthe truth for this time.\nGod calls for Christian families to go into communities that are\nin darkness and error, and work wisely and perseveringly for the\nMaster. To answer this call requires self-sacrifice. While many are\nwaiting to have every obstacle removed, souls are dying without\nhope and without God in the world. Many, very many, for the sake\nof worldly advantage, for the sake of acquiring scientific knowledge,\nwill venture into pestilential regions and endure hardship and pri-\nvation. Where are those who are willing to do this for the sake of\ntelling others of the Saviour? Where are the men and women who\n32 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwill move into regions that are in need of the gospel, that they may\npoint those in darkness to the Redeemer?\nCirculating Our Publications\nMany of God\u2019s people are to go forth with our publications into\nplaces where the third angel\u2019s message has never been proclaimed.[34]\nOur books are to be published in many different languages. With\nthese books, humble, faithful men are to go out as colporteur-evan-\ngelists, bearing the truth to those who would otherwise never be\nenlightened. Those who take up this line of work are to go prepared\nto do medical missionary work. The sick and suffering are to be\nhelped. Many for whom this work of mercy is done will hear and\naccept the words of life.\nThe work of the canvasser-evangelist, whose heart is imbued\nwith the Holy Spirit, is fraught with wonderful possibilities for good.\nThe presentation of the truth, in love and simplicity, from house\nto house, is in harmony with the instruction that Christ gave His\ndisciples when He sent them out on their first missionary tour. By\nsongs of praise, by humble, heartfelt prayers, many will be reached.\nThe divine Worker will be present to send conviction to hearts. \u201cI am\nwith you alway,\u201d is His promise. With the assurance of the abiding\npresence of such a helper we may labor with faith and hope and\ncourage.\nFrom city to city, from country to country, they are to carry the\npublications containing the promise of the Saviour\u2019s soon coming.\nThese publications are to be translated into every language, for to\nall the world the gospel is to be preached. To every worker Christ\npromises the divine efficiency that will make his labors a success.\nThose who have long known the truth need to seek the Lord\nmost earnestly, that their hearts may be filled with a determination\nto work for their neighbors. My brethren and sisters, visit those who\nlive near you, and by sympathy and kindness seek to reach their\nhearts. Be sure to work in a way that will remove prejudice instead\nof creating it. And remember that those who know the truth for this[35]\ntime and yet confine their efforts to their own churches, refusing to\nwork for their unconverted neighbors, will be called to account for\nunfulfilled duties.\nHome Missionary Work 33\nLend your neighbors some of our smaller books. If their interest\nis awakened, take some of the larger books. Show them Christ\u2019s Ob-\nject Lessons. Tell them its history, and ask them if they do not want\na copy. If they already have it, ask them if they do not want to read\nother books of a similar nature. If possible, secure an opportunity to\nteach them the truth. Beside all waters you are to sow the seeds of\ntruth, though not knowing which shall prosper, this or that.\nHouse-to-House Work\nIn many states there are settlements of industrious, well-to-do\nfarmers, who have never had the truth for this time. Such places\nshould be worked. Let our lay members take up this line of service.\nBy lending or selling books, by distributing papers, and by hold-\ning Bible readings, our lay members could do much in their own\nneighborhoods. Filled with love for souls they could proclaim the\nmessage with such power that many would be converted.\nTwo Bible workers were seated in a family. With the open\nBible before them, they presented the Lord Jesus Christ as the sin-\npardoning Saviour. Earnest prayer was offered to God, and hearts\nwere softened and subdued by the influence of the Spirit of God.\nTheir prayers were uttered with freshness and power. As the word\nof God was explained, I saw that a soft, radiant light illumined the\nScriptures, and I said, softly: \u201cGo out into the highways and hedges,\nand compel them to come in, that My house may be filled.\u201d Luke\n14:23.\nThe precious light was communicated from neighbor to neighbor. [36]\nFamily altars which had been broken down were again erected, and\nmany were converted.\nMy brethren and sisters, give yourselves to the Lord for service.\nAllow no opportunity to pass unimproved. Visit the sick and suffer-\ning, and show a kindly interest in them. If possible, do something to\nmake them more comfortable. Through this means you can reach\ntheir hearts and speak a word for Christ.\nEternity alone will reveal how far-reaching such a line of labor\ncan be. Other lines of usefulness will open before those who are\nwilling to do the duty nearest them. It is not learned, eloquent speak-\ners that are needed now, but humble, Christlike men and women,\n34 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwho have learned from Jesus of Nazareth to be meek and lowly, and\nwho, trusting in His strength, will go forth into the highways and\nhedges to give the invitation: \u201cCome; for all things are now ready.\u201d\nVerse 17.\nThose who are wise in agricultural lines, in tilling the soil, those\nwho can construct simple, plain buildings, may help. They can do\ngood work and at the same time show in their characters the high\nstandard to which it is the privilege of this people to attain. Let\nfarmers, financiers, builders, and those who are skilled in various\nother crafts, go to neglected fields, to improve the land, to establish\nindustries, to prepare humble homes for themselves, and to give\ntheir neighbors a knowledge of the truth for this time.\nWork for Women\nThere is a wide field of service for women as well as for men.\nThe efficient cook, the seamstress, the nurse\u2014the help of all is\nneeded. Let the members of poor households be taught how to[37]\ncook, how to make and mend their own clothing, how to nurse the\nsick, how to care properly for the home. Even the children should\nbe taught to do some little errand of love and mercy for those less\nfortunate than themselves.\nThe Home A Mission Field\nLet not parents forget the great mission field that lies before\nthem in the home. In the children committed to her every mother\nhas a sacred charge from God. \u201cTake this son, this daughter,\u201d God\nsays, \u201cand train it for Me. Give it a character polished after the\nsimilitude of a palace, that it may shine in the courts of the Lord\nforever.\u201d The light and glory that shine from the throne of God rest\nupon the faithful mother as she tries to educate her children to resist\nthe influence of evil.\nA Place for Everyone\nThere is earnest work for every pair of hands to do. Let every\nstroke tell for the uplifting of humanity. There are so many that need\nto be helped. The heart of him who lives, not to please himself, but\nHome Missionary Work 35\nto be a blessing to those who have so few blessings, will thrill with\nsatisfaction. Let every idler awake and face the realities of life. Take\nthe word of God and search its pages. If you are doers of the word,\nlife will indeed be to you a living reality, and you will find that the\nreward is abundant.\nThe Lord has a place for everyone in His great plan. Talents\nthat are not needed are not bestowed. Supposing that the talent is\nsmall. God has a place for it, and that one talent, if faithfully used,\nwill do the very work God designs that it should do. The talents of [38]\nthe humble cottager are needed in the house-to-house labor and can\naccomplish more in this work than brilliant gifts.\nA thousand doors of usefulness are open before us. We lament\nthe scanty resources at present available, while various and urgent\ndemands are pressing us for means and men. Were we thoroughly\nin earnest, even now we could multiply the resources a hundredfold.\nSelfishness and self-indulgence bar the way.\nChurch members, let the light shine forth. Let your voices be\nheard in humble prayer, in witness against intemperance, the folly,\nand the amusements of this world, and in the proclamation of the\ntruth for this time. Your voice, your influence, your time\u2014all these\nare gifts from God and are to be used in winning souls to Christ.\nVisit your neighbors and show an interest in the salvation of their\nsouls. Arouse every spiritual energy to action. Tell those whom you\nvisit that the end of all things is at hand. The Lord Jesus Christ will\nopen the door of their hearts and will make upon their minds lasting\nimpressions.\nStrive to arouse men and women from their spiritual insensibility.\nTell them how you found Jesus and how blessed you have been since\nyou gained an experience in His service. Tell them what blessing\ncomes to you as you sit at the feet of Jesus and learn precious lessons\nfrom His word. Tell them of the gladness and joy that there is in the\nChristian life. Your warm, fervent words will convince them that you\nhave found the pearl of great price. Let your cheerful, encouraging\nwords show that you have certainly found the higher way. This is\ngenuine missionary work, and as it is done, many will awake as from\na dream.\nEven while engaged in their daily employment, God\u2019s people [39]\ncan lead others to Christ. And while doing this they will have the\n36 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nprecious assurance that the Saviour is close beside them. They need\nnot think that they are left to depend on their own feeble efforts.\nChrist will give them words to speak that will refresh and encourage\nand strengthen poor, struggling souls who are in darkness. Their\nown faith will be strengthened as they realize that the Redeemer\u2019s\npromise is being fulfilled. Not only are they a blessing to others, but\nthe work they do for Christ brings blessing to themselves.\nThere are many who can and should do the work of which I have\nspoken. My brother, my sister, what are you doing for Christ? Are\nyou seeking to be a blessing to others? Are your lips uttering words\nof kindness, sympathy, and love? Are you putting forth earnest\nefforts to win others to the Saviour?\nThe Result of Failing to Work\nComparatively little missionary work is done, and what is the\nresult? The truths that Christ gave are not taught. Many of God\u2019s\npeople are not growing in grace. Many are in an unpleasant, com-\nplaining frame of mind. Those who are not helping others to see\nthe importance of the truth for this time must feel dissatisfied with\nthemselves. Satan takes advantage of this feature in their experience\nand leads them to criticize and find fault. If they were busily engaged\nin seeking to know and do the will of God they would feel such a\nburden for perishing souls, such an unrest of mind, that they could\nnot be restrained from fulfilling the commission: \u201cGo ye into all the\nworld, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d Mark 16:15.\nAn Appeal for Untiring Effort[40]\nThe Lord calls upon His people to arouse out of sleep. The end\nof all things is at hand. When those who know the truth will be\nlaborers together with God, the fruits of righteousness will appear.\nBy the revelation of the love of God in missionary effort many will\nbe awakened to see the sinfulness of their own course of action.\nThey will see that in the past their selfishness has disqualified them\nfrom being laborers together with God. The exhibition of the love\nof God as seen in unselfish ministry to others will be the means of\nleading many souls to believe the word of God just as it reads.\nHome Missionary Work 37\nGod desires to refresh His people by the gift of the Holy Spirit,\nbaptizing them anew in His love. There is no need for a dearth of\nthe Spirit in the church. After Christ\u2019s ascension the Holy Spirit\ncame upon the waiting, praying, believing disciples with a fullness\nand power that reached every heart. In the future the earth is to be\nlightened with the glory of God. A holy influence is to go forth to\nthe world from those who are sanctified through the truth. The earth\nis to be encircled with an atmosphere of grace. The Holy Spirit is to\nwork on human hearts, taking the things of God and showing them\nto men.\nMissionary Families\nVery much more might be done for Christ if all who have the\nlight of truth would practice the truth. There are whole families who\nmight be missionaries, engaging in personal labor, toiling for the\nMaster with busy hands and active brains, devising new methods for\nthe success of His work. There are earnest, prudent, warmhearted [41]\nmen and women who could do much for Christ if they would give\nthemselves to God, drawing near to Him and seeking Him with the\nwhole heart.\nMy brethren and sisters, take an active part in the work of soul-\nsaving. This work will give life and vigor to the mental and spiritual\npowers. Light from Christ will shine into the mind. The Saviour\nwill abide in your hearts, and in His light you will see light.\nConsecrate yourselves wholly to the work of God. He is your\nstrength, and He will be at your right hand, helping you to carry on\nHis merciful designs. By personal labor reach those around you.\nBecome acquainted with them. Preaching will not do the work that\nneeds to be done. Angels of God attend you to the dwellings of\nthose you visit. This work cannot be done by proxy. Money lent\nor given will not accomplish it. Sermons will not do it. By visiting\nthe people, talking, praying, sympathizing with them, you will win\nhearts. This is the highest missionary work that you can do. To do\nit, you will need resolute, persevering faith, unwearying patience,\nand a deep love for souls.\nFind access to the people in whose neighborhood you live. As\nyou tell them of the truth, use words of Christlike sympathy. Re-\n38 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nmember that the Lord Jesus is the Master Worker. He waters the\nseed sown. He puts into your minds words that will reach hearts.\nExpect that God will sustain the consecrated, unselfish worker. Obe-\ndience, childlike faith, trust in God\u2014these will bring peace and joy.\nWork disinterestedly, lovingly, patiently, for all with whom you are\nbrought into contact. Show no impatience. Utter not one unkind\nword. Let the love of Christ be in your hearts, the law of kindness\non your lips.\nIt is a mystery that there are not hundreds at work where now[42]\nthere is but one. The heavenly universe is astonished at the apathy,\nthe coldness, the listlessness of those who profess to be sons and\ndaughters of God. In the truth there is a living power. Go forth\nin faith, and proclaim the truth as if you believed it. Let those for\nwhom you labor see that to you it is indeed a living reality.\nDevelopment Through Service\nThose who give their lives to Christlike ministry know the mean-\ning of true happiness. Their interests and their prayers reach far\nbeyond self. They themselves are growing as they try to help others.\nThey become familiar with the largest plans, the most stirring enter-\nprises, and how can they but grow when they place themselves in\nthe divine channel of light and blessing? Such ones receive wisdom\nfrom heaven. They become more and more identified with Christ\nin all His plans. There is no opportunity for spiritual stagnation.\nSelfish ambition and self-seeking are rebuked by constant contact\nwith the absorbing interests, the elevated aspirations, which belong\nto high and holy activities.\nChapter 4\u2014The Need of Earnest Effort [43]\nIn the power of the Spirit the delegated servants of Christ are to\nbear witness for their Leader. The yearning desire of the Saviour\nfor the salvation of sinners is to mark all their efforts. The gracious\ninvitation, first given by Christ, is to be taken up by human voices\nand sounded throughout the world: \u201cWhosoever will, let him take the\nwater of life freely.\u201d Revelation 22:17. The church is to say: \u201cCome.\u201d\nEvery power in the church is to be actively engaged on the side of\nChrist. The followers of Christ are to combine in a strong effort to\ncall the attention of the world to the fast-fulfilling prophecies of the\nword of God. Infidelity and spiritualism are gaining a strong hold in\nthe world. Shall those to whom great light has been given be cold\nand faithless now?\nWe are on the very verge of the time of trouble, and perplexities\nthat are scarcely dreamed of are before us. A power from beneath\nis leading men to war against Heaven. Human beings have con-\nfederated with satanic agencies to make void the law of God. The\ninhabitants of the world are fast becoming as the inhabitants of the\nworld in Noah\u2019s day, who were swept away by the Flood, and as\nthe inhabitants of Sodom, who were consumed by fire from heaven.\nThe powers of Satan are at work to keep minds diverted from eternal\nrealities. The enemy has arranged matters to suit his own purposes.\nWorldly business, sports, the fashions of the day\u2014these things oc-\ncupy the minds of men and women. Amusements and unprofitable\nreading spoil the judgment. In the broad road that leads to eternal\nruin there walks a long procession. The world, filled with violence,\nreveling, and drunkenness, is converting the church. The law of God, [44]\nthe divine standard of righteousness, is declared to be of no effect.\nAt this time\u2014a time of overwhelming iniquity\u2014a new life,\ncoming from the Source of all life, is to take possession of those\nwho have the love of God in their hearts, and they are to go forth to\nproclaim with power the message of a crucified and risen Saviour.\nThey are to put forth earnest, untiring efforts to save souls. Their\n39\n40 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nexample is to be such that it will have a telling influence for good\non those around them. They are to count all things but loss for the\nexcellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus our Lord.\nIntense earnestness should now take possession of us. Our slum-\nbering energies should be aroused to untiring effort. Consecrated\nworkers should go forth into the field clearing the King\u2019s highway,\nand gaining victories in new places. My brother, my sister, is it\nnothing to you to know that every day souls are going down into the\ngrave unwarned and unsaved, ignorant of their need of eternal life\nand of the atonement made for them by the Saviour? Is it nothing\nto you that soon the world is to meet Jehovah over His broken law?\nHeavenly angels marvel that those who for so many years have had\nthe light, have not carried the torch of truth into the dark places of\nthe earth.\nThe infinite value of the sacrifice required for our redemption\nreveals the fact that sin is a tremendous evil. God might have wiped\nout this foul blot upon creation by sweeping the sinner from the face\nof the earth. But He \u201cso loved the world, that He gave His only-\nbegotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,\nbut have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. Then why are we not more\nin earnest? Why are so large a number idle? Why are not all who[45]\nprofess to love God, seeking to enlighten their neighbors and their\nassociates, that they may no longer neglect so great salvation?\nA Lack of Sympathy\nAmong professing Christians of today there is a fearful lack of\nthe sympathy that should be felt for souls unsaved. Unless our hearts\nbeat in unison with the heart of Christ, how can we understand the\nsacredness and importance of the work to which we are called by\nthe words: \u201cWatch for ... souls, as they that must give account\u201d? We\ntalk of Christian missions. The sound of our voices is heard, but do\nwe feel Christ\u2019s tender heart-longing for souls?\nThe Saviour was an untiring worker. He did not measure His\nwork by hours. His time, His heart, His strength, were given to labor\nfor the benefit of humanity. Entire days were devoted to labor, and\nentire nights were spent in prayer, that He might be braced to meet\nNeed of Earnest Effort 41\nthe wily foe in all his deceptive working, and fortified to do His\nwork of uplifting and restoring humanity.\nThe man who loves God does not measure his work by the eight-\nhour system. He works at all hours and is never off duty. As he has\nopportunity he does good. Everywhere, at all times and in all places,\nhe finds opportunity to work for God. He carries fragrance with him\nwherever he goes. A wholesome atmosphere surrounds his soul.\nThe beauty of his well-ordered life and godly conversation inspires\nin others faith and hope and courage.\nIt is heart missionaries that are needed. Spasmodic efforts will\ndo little good. We must arrest the attention. We must be deeply in\nearnest.\nBy aggressive warfare, in the midst of opposition, peril, loss, and [46]\nhuman suffering, the work of soulsaving is to be carried forward. At\na certain battle, when one of the regiments of the attacking force was\nbeing beaten back by the hordes of the enemy, the ensign in front\nstood his ground as the troops retreated. The captain shouted to him\nto bring back the colors, but the reply of the ensign was: \u201cBring the\nmen up to the colors!\u201d This is the work that devolves upon every\nfaithful standard-bearer\u2014to bring the men up to the colors. The\nLord calls for wholeheartedness. We all know that the sin of many\nprofessing Christians is that they lack the courage and energy to\nbring themselves and those connected with them up to the standard.\nFrom all countries the Macedonian cry is sounding: \u201cCome over,\n... and help us.\u201d God has opened fields before us, and if human\nagencies would but co-operate with divine agencies, many, many\nsouls would be won to the truth. But the Lord\u2019s professing people\nhave been sleeping over their allotted work, and in many places\nit remains comparatively untouched. God has sent message after\nmessage to arouse our people to do something, and to do it now. But\nto the call, \u201cWhom shall I send?\u201d there have been few to respond,\n\u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8.\nWhen the reproach of indolence and slothfulness shall have been\nwiped away from the church, the Spirit of the Lord will be graciously\nmanifested. Divine power will be revealed. The church will see the\nprovidential working of the Lord of hosts. The light of truth will\nshine forth in clear, strong rays, and, as in the time of the apostles,\n42 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nmany souls will turn from error to truth. The earth will be lighted\nwith the glory of the Lord.\nHeavenly angels have long been waiting for human agents\u2014\nthe members of the church\u2014to co-operate with them in the great[47]\nwork to be done. They are waiting for you. So vast is the field, so\ncomprehensive the design, that every sanctified heart will be pressed\ninto service as an instrument of divine power.\nAt the same time there will be a power working from beneath.\nWhile God\u2019s agents of mercy work through consecrated human\nbeings, Satan sets his agencies in operation, laying under tribute all\nwho will submit to his control. There will be lords many and gods\nmany. The cry will be heard, \u201cLo, here is Christ,\u201d and, \u201cLo, there\nis Christ.\u201d The deep plotting of Satan will reveal itself everywhere\nfor the purpose of diverting the attention of men and women from\npresent duty. There will be signs and wonders. But the eye of faith\nwill discern in all these manifestations harbingers of the grand and\nawful future, and the triumphs that await the people of God.\nWork, oh, work, keeping eternity in view! Bear in mind that\nevery power must be sanctified. A great work is to be done. Let the\nprayer go forth from unfeigned lips: \u201cGod be merciful unto us, and\nbless us; and cause His face to shine upon us.... That Thy way may\nbe known upon earth, Thy saving health among all nations.\u201d Psalm\n67:1, 2.\nThose who realize, even in a limited degree, what redemption\nmeans to them and to their fellow men, will walk by faith and will\ncomprehend in some measure the vast needs of humanity. Their\nhearts will be moved to compassion as they see the widespread\ndestitution in our world\u2014the destitution of the multitudes who are\nsuffering for food and clothing, and the moral destitution of thou-\nsands who are under the shadow of a terrible doom, in comparison\nwith which physical suffering fades into nothingness.\nLet church members bear in mind that the fact that their names[48]\nare registered on the church books will not save them. They must\nshow themselves approved of God, workmen that need not be\nashamed. Day by day they are to build their characters in accordance\nwith Christ\u2019s directions. They are to abide in Him, constantly exer-\ncising faith in Him. Thus they will grow up to the full stature of men\nand women in Christ\u2014wholesome, cheerful, grateful Christians,\nNeed of Earnest Effort 43\nled by God into clearer and still clearer light. If this is not their\nexperience, they will be among those whose voices will one day be\nraised in the bitter lamentation: \u201cThe harvest is past, the summer is\nended, and my soul is not saved! Why did I not flee to the Stronghold\nfor refuge? Why have I trifled with my soul\u2019s salvation, and done\ndespite to the Spirit of grace?\u201d\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.\u201d\nZephaniah 1:14. Let us be shod with the gospel shoes, ready to\nmarch at a moment\u2019s notice. Every hour, every minute, is precious.\nWe have no time to spend in self-gratification. All around us there\nare souls perishing in sin. Every day there is something to do for\nour Lord and Master. Every day we are to point souls to the Lamb\nof God, who taketh away the sin of the world.\n\u201cBe ye also ready: for in such an hour as we think not the Son\nof man cometh.\u201d Matthew 24:44. Go to your rest at night with every\nsin confessed. Thus we did when in 1844 we expected to meet our\nLord. And now this great event is nearer than when we first believed.\nBe ye always ready, in the evening, in the morning, and at noon, that\nwhen the cry is heard, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out\nto meet Him,\u201d you may, even though awakened out of sleep, go forth\nto meet Him with your lamps trimmed and burning.\nChapter 5\u2014\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d[49]\nSelf-sacrifice is the keynote of the teachings of Christ. Often\nit is presented and enjoined in language that seems authoritative,\nbecause God sees that there is no other way to save man than to cut\naway from his life the selfishness which, if retained, would degrade\nthe whole being.\nChrist became poor that we might be partakers of the \u201cfar more\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory.\u201d 2 Corinthians 4:17. We are\nto practice the same self-sacrifice that led Him to give Himself up to\nthe death of the cross, to make it possible for human beings to have\neternal life. In all our expenditure of means we are to strive to fulfill\nthe purpose of Him who is the alpha and omega of all Christian\neffort.\nWe are to place in the Lord\u2019s treasury all the means that we can\nspare. For this means, needy, unworked fields are calling. From\nmany lands is sounding the cry, \u201cCome over, ... and help us.\u201d Our\nchurch members should feel a deep interest in home and foreign\nmissions. Great blessings will come to them as they make self-\nsacrificing efforts to plant the standard of truth in new territory. The\nmoney invested in this work will bring rich returns. New converts,\nrejoicing in the light received from the word, will in their turn give\nof their means to carry the light of truth to others.\nGod\u2019s Benevolence\nGod gives to us regularly, freely, abundantly. Every earthly\nblessing is from His hand. What if the Lord should cease to bestow\nHis gifts upon us? What a cry of wretchedness, suffering, and want\nwould go up from the earth! We need daily the unfailing flow of\nJehovah\u2019s goodness.\nThis world was established and is sustained by the compassionate[50]\nlove of the Creator. God is the giver of all we have. He calls upon\nus to return to Him a portion of the abundance He has bestowed\n44\n\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d 45\non us. Think of the care He gives the earth, sending the rain and\nsunshine in their season, to cause vegetation to flourish. He bestows\nHis favors on the just and on the unjust. Shall not the recipients of\nHis blessings show their gratitude by giving of their means to help\nsuffering humanity?\nThere are many souls to be brought to the saving knowledge\nof the truth. The prodigal is far from his Father\u2019s house, perishing\nwith hunger. He is to be the object of our compassion. Do you ask:\n\u201cHow does God regard those who are perishing in their sins?\u201d I point\nyou to Calvary. God \u201cgave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever\nbelieveth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John\n3:16. Think of the Saviour\u2019s matchless love. While we were yet\nsinners, Christ died to save us from eternal death. In return for the\ngreat love wherewith Christ has loved you, you are to bring to Him\nyour thank offering. You are to make a gratitude offering of yourself.\nYour time, your talents, your means\u2014all are to flow to the world in a\ntide of love for the saving of the lost. Jesus has made it possible for\nyou to accept His love and in happy co-operation with Him to work\nunder its fragrant influence. He requires you to use your possessions\nin unselfish service, that His plan for the salvation of souls shall be\ncarried forward with power. He expects you to give your undivided\nenergies to His work.\nWould you make your property secure? Place it in the hand that\nbears the nailprint of the crucifixion. Retain it in your possession, [51]\nand it will be to your eternal loss. Give it to God, and from that\nmoment it bears His inscription. It is sealed with His immutability.\nWould you enjoy your substance? Then use it for the blessing of the\nsuffering.\nThe World\u2019s Need of Help\nThe magnitude of our work calls for willing liberality on the\npart of the people of God. In Africa, in China, in India, there are\nthousands, yes, millions, who have not heard the message of the\ntruth for this time. They must be warned. The islands of the sea are\nwaiting for a knowledge of God. In these islands schools are to be\nestablished to prepare students to go to higher schools within reach,\n46 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthere to be educated and trained, and sent back to their island homes\nto give to others the light they have received.\nIn our own country there is much to be done. There are many\ncities to be entered and warned. Evangelists should be finding their\nway into all the places where the minds of men are agitated over the\nquestion of Sunday legislation and the teaching of religion in the\npublic schools. It is the neglect of Seventh-day Adventists to improve\nthese providential opportunities that is hindering the advancement\nof the cause.\nThe Lord has made us His stewards. He has placed His means in\nour hands for faithful distribution. He asks us to render to Him His\nown. He has reserved the tithe as His sacred portion to be used in\nsending the gospel to all parts of the world. My brethren and sisters,\nconfess and forsake your selfishness, and bring to the Lord your\ngifts and offerings. Bring Him also the tithe that you have withheld.\nCome confessing your neglect. Prove the Lord, as He has invited[52]\nyou to do. \u201cI will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall\nnot destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her\nfruit before the time in the field, saith the Lord of hosts.\u201d Malachi\n3:11.\nOur Selfishness a Hindrance to God\u2019s Work\nInstruction has been given me that there is a withholding of\nthe tithe that should be faithfully brought into the Lord\u2019s treasury\nfor the support of ministers and missionaries who are opening the\nScriptures to the people and working from house to house. The work\nof evangelizing the world has been greatly hindered by personal\nselfishness. Some, even among professing Christians, are unable\nto see that the work of the gospel is to be supported by the means\nthat Christ has given them. Money is needed in order that the work\ndone all over the world may be carried forward. Thousands upon\nthousands are perishing in sin, and a lack of means is hindering\nthe proclamation of the truth that is to be carried to all nations and\nkindreds and tongues and people. There are men ready to go forth as\nthe Lord\u2019s messengers, but because of a lack of means in the treasury\nthey cannot be sent to the places where the people are begging for\nsomeone to come and teach them the truth.\n\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d 47\nThere are many in our world who are longing to hear the word\nof life. But how can they hear without a preacher? And how can\nthose sent to teach them live without support? God would have the\nlives of His workers carefully sustained. They are His property, and\nHe is dishonored when they are compelled to labor in a way that\ninjures their health. He is dishonored, also, when for lack of means\nworkers cannot be sent to destitute fields.\nIn place of complaining of the officers of the General Confer- [53]\nence because they cannot respond to the multiplied calls for men and\nmeans, let our church members bear a living testimony to the power\nof the truth by denying self and giving liberally for the advance-\nment of the work. Let our sisters save by refusing to put expensive\ntrimmings on their garments. Let every unnecessary expense be cut\ndown. Let every family bring their tithes and offerings to the Lord.\nGod\u2019s Almoners\nThose who are truly converted will regard themselves as God\u2019s\nalmoners and will dispense, for the advancement of the work, the\nmeans He has placed in their hands. If Christ\u2019s words were obeyed,\nthere would be sufficient means in His treasury for the needs of His\ncause. He has entrusted to men and women an abundance of means\nfor the carrying forward of His plan of mercy and benevolence.\nHe bids His stewards of means invest their money in the work of\nfeeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and preaching the gospel to\nthe poor. Perfection of character cannot possibly be attained without\nself-sacrifice.\nNever was there a more important time in the history of our work\nthan the present. The message of the third chapter of Malachi comes\nto us, holding up before us the need of honesty in our relations to the\nLord and His work. My brethren, the money that you use to buy and\nsell and get gain will be a curse to you if you withhold from the Lord\nthat which is His. The means entrusted to you for the advancement\nof the Lord\u2019s work should be used in sending the gospel to all parts\nof the world.\nWe are Christ\u2019s witnesses, and we are not to allow worldly [54]\ninterests and plans to absorb our time and attention. There are\nhigher interests at stake. \u201cSeek ye first the kingdom of God, and\n48 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nHis righteousness.\u201d Matthew 6:33. Christ gave Himself willingly\nand cheerfully to the carrying out of the will of God. He became\nobedient unto death, even the death of the cross. In view of all that\nHe has done, should we feel it a hardship to deny self? Shall we draw\nback from being partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings? His death ought to\nstir every fiber of our beings, making us willing to consecrate to His\nwork all that we have and are. As we think of all that He has done\nfor us, our hearts should be filled with gratitude and love, and we\nshould renounce all selfishness. What duty could the heart refuse to\nperform under the constraining influence of the love of Christ?\nShall we not, by self-denial, do all that we can to advance God\u2019s\nenterprise of mercy? Can we behold the divine condescension, the\nsuffering endured by the Son of God, without being filled with a\ndesire to be allowed to sacrifice something for Him? Is it not a high\nhonor to be allowed to co-operate with Him? He left His heavenly\nhome to seek for us. Shall we not become His undershepherds, to\nseek for the lost and straying? Shall we not reveal in our lives His\ndivine tenderness and compassion?\nThe Lord desires His people to be thoughtful and care-taking.\nHe desires them to practice economy in everything. If the workers\nin the mission fields could have the means that is used in expensive\nfurnishings and in personal adornment, the triumphs of the cross of\nChrist would be greatly extended.\nNot all can make large offerings, not all can do great works,\nmagnificent deeds; but all can practice self-denial, all can reveal\nthe unselfishness of the Saviour. Some can bring large gifts to the[55]\nLord\u2019s treasury; others can bring only mites; but every gift brought\nin sincerity is accepted by the Lord.\nWe plead for the money that is spent on needless things. My\nbrethren and sisters, waste not your money in purchasing unneces-\nsary things. You may think these little sums do not amount to much,\nbut many littles will make a great whole. Cut off every extravagant\nexpenditure. Indulge in nothing that is simply for display. Your\nmoney means the salvation of souls. Let there be systematic giving\non the part of all. Some may be unable to give a large sum, but all\ncan lay aside each week something for the Master. Let the children\nact their part. Let parents teach their children to save their pennies to\ngive to the Lord. The gospel ministry is to be supported by self-de-\n\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d 49\nnial and sacrifice. Through the self-denying efforts of God\u2019s people\nothers will be brought into the faith, and these in turn will help to\nincrease the offerings made for the carrying forward of the Lord\u2019s\nwork.\nUnmistakable evidences point to the nearness of the end. The\nway must be prepared for the coming of the Prince of Peace. Let not\nour church members complain because they are so often called upon\nto give. What is it that makes the frequent calls a necessity? Is it not\nthe rapid increase of missionary enterprises? Shall we, by refusing\nto give, retard the growth of these enterprises? Shall we forget that\nwe are laborers together with God? From every church, prayers\nshould ascend to God for an increase of devotion and liberality. My\nbrethren and sisters, do not plead for retrenchment in evangelical\nwork. So long as there are souls to save, our interest in the work of\nsoulsaving is to know no abating. The church cannot abridge her\ntask without denying her Master. Not all can go as missionaries to\nforeign lands, but all can give of their means for the carrying forward [56]\nof foreign missions.\nThere are new fields to be entered, and we must have your\nhelp. Shall we ignore the commission given us, and thus forfeit the\nfulfillment of the promise accompanying the commission? Shall the\npeople of God become careless and indifferent, and refuse to give\nof their means for the advancement of His work? Can they do this\nwithout severing their connection with Him? They may think thus to\neconomize, but it is a fearful economy that places them where they\nare separated from God.\nMy brethren and sisters, it is too late to devote your time and\nstrength to self-serving. Let not the last day find you destitute of the\nheavenly treasure. Seek to push the triumphs of the cross, seek to\nenlighten souls, labor for the salvation of your fellow beings, and\nyour work will abide the trying test of fire.\nEvery true, self-sacrificing worker for God is willing to spend\nand be spent for the sake of others. Christ says: \u201cHe that loveth his\nlife shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep\nit unto life eternal.\u201d John 12:25. By earnest, thoughtful efforts to\nhelp where help is needed, the true Christian shows his love for God\nand for his fellow beings. He may lose his life in service; but when\nChrist comes to gather His jewels to Himself, he will find it again.\n50 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nMy brethren and sisters, do not spend a large amount of time\nand money on self, for the sake of appearance. Those who do this\nare obliged to leave undone many things that would have comforted\nothers, sending a warm glow to their weary spirits. We all need\nto learn how to improve faithfully the opportunities that so often\ncome to us to bring light and hope into the lives of others. How[57]\ncan we improve these opportunities if our thoughts are centered on\nself? He who is self-centered loses countless opportunities for doing\nthat which would have brought blessing to himself and others. It is\nthe duty of the servant of Christ, under every circumstance, to ask\nhimself, What can I do to help others? Having done his best, he is\nto leave the consequences with God.\nGod has provided for everyone pleasure that may be enjoyed by\nrich and poor alike\u2014the pleasure found in cultivating pureness of\nthought and unselfishness of action, the pleasure that comes from\nspeaking sympathizing words and doing kindly deeds. From those\nwho perform such service, the light of Christ shines to brighten lives\ndarkened by many sorrows.\nThe temptation may come to you to invest your money in land.\nPerhaps your children will advise you to do this. But can you not\nshow a better way? Has not your money been entrusted to you to be\ntraded upon wisely, and put out to usury, that when the Lord comes,\nHe may find the talents doubled? Can you not see that He wants\nyou to use your means in helping to build meeting houses and to\nestablish sanitariums?\nWe need now to esteem souls above money. If you know of a\nhigher work in this world than the work of soulsaving, a work which\nwill bring better results for the investment of means, will you not\ntell us of it, that we may measure its value?\nI fear that many of our people do not realize the importance of\nGod\u2019s work. One to whom I wrote for money answered thus: \u201cI\nreceived your letter asking me to lend you some money. But there\nwas a piece of land that the children thought it advisable for me to\npurchase, and I have invested my spare means in this land.\u201d How[58]\nmuch better would it have been for this brother to invest his money\nin establishing sanitariums, in which witness is borne to the truth for\nthis time, or in schools, which will provide for our youth the best\n\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d 51\ninfluences, and in which they can be trained to become missionaries\nfor God.\nMy brethren and sisters, invest your means in the establishment\nof Christian missions, from which the light of truth will shine forth,\ndrawing souls to God. One soul, truly converted, becoming a mis-\nsionary for God, will win other souls to the Saviour.\nGod Himself originated plans for the advancement of His work,\nand He has provided His people with a surplus of means, that when\nHe calls for help, they may respond, saying: Lord, Thy pound hath\ngained other pounds.\u201d\nIf those to whom God\u2019s money has been entrusted will be faithful\nin bringing the means lent them to the Lord\u2019s treasury, His work\nwill make rapid advancement. Many souls will be won to the cause\nof truth, and the day of Christ\u2019s coming will be hastened. Men\nand women are to be brought under the influence of true, earnest,\nwholehearted workers, who labor for souls as they that must give an\naccount. All who are baptized into a measure of the apostolic spirit\nwill be constrained to become God\u2019s missionaries. If they will be\ntrue, firm in the faith, if they will not sell their Lord for gain, but\nwill ever acknowledge the divine supremacy and superintendence,\nGod will prepare the way before them and will greatly bless them.\nHe will help them to represent His goodness, love, and mercy. And\nthe glory of the Lord will be their rearward. There will be joy in the\nheavenly courts, and joy, pure, heavenly joy, will fill the hearts of the [59]\nworkers. To save perishing souls they will be willing to spend and\nbe spent, and their hearts will be filled with love and thanksgiving.\nThe consciousness of God\u2019s presence will purify and ennoble their\nexperience, enriching and strengthening them. The grace of heaven\nwill be revealed in their work, in the conquests achieved in winning\nsouls to Christ.\nSo God\u2019s work in our world is to be carried forward. Faithful\nstewards are to place the Lord\u2019s money in His treasury, that workers\nmay be sent to all parts of the world. The church here below is to\nserve God with self-denial and sacrifice. Thus the work is to be\ncarried forward and the most glorious triumphs won.\nLove for lost souls brought Christ to Calvary\u2019s cross. Love for\nsouls will lead us to self-denial and sacrifice, for the saving of that\nwhich is lost. And as Christ\u2019s followers give back to the Lord His\n52 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nown, they are accumulating treasure which will be theirs when they\nhear the words: \u201cWell done, thou good and faithful servant: ... enter\nthou into the joy of thy Lord,\u201d \u201cwho for the joy that was set before\nHim endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the\nright hand of the throne of God.\u201d Matthew 25:21; Hebrews 12:2.\nThe joy of seeing souls eternally saved will be the reward of all who\nfollow in the steps of the Redeemer.\n* * * * *\n\u201cHe that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all,\nhow shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?\u201d Romans\n8:32.\nIt was a costly sacrifice that the Lord of heaven made. Divine\nbenevolence was stirred to its unfathomable depths; it was impos-[60]\nsible for God to give more. He \u201cso loved the world, that He gave\nHis only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not\nperish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. Why is our gratitude\nso limited? It is only as a ripple on the surface, compared with the\ngreat tide of love that flows to us from the Father.\n* * * * *\nThe signs that foretell the second coming of Christ are fast ful-\nfilling. Shall the people be left in ignorance of the great event before\nthem and have to meet that awful day unprepared? Heaven has made\na complete offering for the salvation of the world. Shall those who\nprofess to love God and keep His commandments be indifferent to\nthe souls of men? No, no! they cannot be.\nWith untiring zeal those who have received the light of present\ntruth should go forth to give this light to those who sit in darkness.\nWith consecrated efforts, by self-denial and self-sacrifice, they are\nto labor in the strength of the God of Israel. This message is to be\ncarried to foreign lands; it is to be given to the cities and towns of\nour own country. The weary and the heavy-laden are longing for the\nmessage of truth that will give them rest and peace in Christ. Who\nwill carry the message to those who have never heard it? Who will\nseek the joy and glory of God by drawing sinners to the feet of Him\n\u201cFreely Ye Have Received, Freely Give\u201d 53\nwho gave His life a sacrifice for every soul? Who will lift up the\nSaviour before men as \u201cthe Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin\nof the world\u201d? John 1:29.\n54 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nSection 2\u2014Literature in Service [A portion [61]\nof this matter was published first in 1908.]\n\u201cThe Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that\npublished it. \u201d Psalm 68:11.\nChapter 6\u2014Our Publications\nThe great and wonderful work of the last gospel message is to be\ncarried on now as it has never been before. The world is to receive\nthe light of truth through an evangelizing ministry of the word in our\nbooks and periodicals. Our publications are to show that the end of\nall things is at hand. I am bidden to say to our publishing houses:\n\u201cLift up the standard; lift it up higher. Proclaim the third angel\u2019s\nmessage, that it may be heard by all the world. Let it be seen that\n\u2018here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of\nJesus.\u2019 Revelation 14:12. Let our literature give the message as a\nwitness to all the world.\u201d\nOur workers should now be encouraged to give their first atten-\ntion to books that deal with the evidences of our faith\u2014books that\nteach the doctrines of the Bible and that will prepare a people to\nstand in the trying times before us. Having brought a people to the\nenlightenment of the truth by prayerful labor in Bible instruction,\nand through a wise use of our publications, we are to teach them to\nbecome laborers in word and doctrine. We are to encourage them to\nscatter the books that deal with Bible subjects\u2014books the teachings\nof which will prepare a people to stand, having their loins girded\nwith truth and their lamps burning.\nWe have been asleep, as it were, regarding the work that may[62]\nbe accomplished by the circulation of well-prepared literature. Let\nus now, by the wise use of periodicals and books, preach the word\nwith determined energy, that the world may understand the message\nthat Christ gave to John on the Isle of Patmos. Let every human\nintelligence who professes the name of Christ testify: \u201cThe end of\nall things is at hand; prepare to meet thy God.\u201d\nOur publications should go everywhere. Let them be issued in\nmany languages. The third angel\u2019s message is to be given through\nthis medium and through the living teacher. You who believe the\ntruth for this time, wake up. It is your duty now to bring in all the\nmeans possible to help those who understand the truth to proclaim\n56\nOur Publications 57\nit. Part of the money that comes in from the sale of our publications\nshould be used to increase our facilities for the production of more\nliterature that will open blind eyes and break up the fallow ground\nof the heart.\nThere is danger of entering into commercialism and becoming so\nengrossed in worldly business that the truths of the word of God in\ntheir purity and power will not be brought into the life. The love of\ntrade and gain is becoming more and more prevalent. My brethren,\nlet your souls be truly converted. If ever there was a time when we\nneeded to understand our responsibilities, it is now, when truth is\nfallen in the streets and equity cannot enter. Satan has come down\nwith great power to work with all deceivableness of unrighteousness\nin them that perish; and everything that can be shaken will be shaken,\nand those things that cannot be shaken will remain. The Lord is\ncoming very soon, and we are entering into scenes of calamity.\nSatanic agencies, though unseen, are working to destroy human life.\nBut if our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall see of His grace\nand salvation. Christ is coming to establish His kingdom on the [63]\nearth. Let our tongues be sanctified and used to glorify Him. Let\nus work now as we have never worked before. We are exhorted to\n\u201cbe instant in season, out of season.\u201d 2 Timothy 4:2. We are to make\nopenings for the presentation of the truth. We are to improve every\nopportunity of drawing souls to Christ.\nAs a people we are to be reconverted, our lives sanctified to\ndeclare the truth as it is in Jesus. In the work of scattering our\npublications, we can speak of a Saviour\u2019s love from a warm and\nthrobbing heart. God alone has the power to forgive sins; if we do\nnot speak this message to the unconverted, our neglect may prove\ntheir ruin. Blessed, soul-saving Bible truths are published in our\npapers. There are many who can help in the work of selling our\nperiodicals. The Lord calls upon all of us to seek to save perishing\nsouls. Satan is at work to deceive the very elect, and now is our\ntime to work with vigilance. Our books and papers are to be brought\nbefore the notice of the people; the gospel of present truth is to be\ngiven to our cities without delay. Shall we not arouse to our duties?\nIf we are making the life and teachings of Christ our study, every\npassing event will furnish a text for an impressive discourse. It was\nthus the Saviour preached the gospel in the highways and byways;\n58 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nand as He spoke, the little group that listened to Him swelled to a\ngreat company. Present-day evangelists are to be workers together\nwith Christ. These, just as verily as the first disciples, have the\nassurance: \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. Go\nye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of\nthe Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching them to\nobserve all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am[64]\nwith you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d Matthew 28:18-20.\nThe work to be carried on by the people of God is declared in\nthe words of Inspiration: \u201cBehold, I send My messenger before Thy\nface, which shall prepare Thy way before Thee. The voice of one\ncrying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His\npaths straight.\u201d Mark 1:2, 3. \u201cBehold My servant, whom I uphold;\nMine elect, in whom My soul delighteth; I have put My Spirit upon\nHim. He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.... He shall not\nfail nor be discouraged, till He have set judgment in the earth: and\nthe isles shall wait for His law.\u201d Isaiah 42:1-4.\nGod invites all men to the fullest investigation of the claims of\nHis law. His word is sacred and infinite. The cause of truth is to\ngo forth as a lamp that burneth. Earnest study of the word of God\nwill reveal the truth. Sin and wrong will not be sustained, but the\nlaw of God will be vindicated. \u201cThus saith God the Lord, He that\ncreated the heavens, and stretched them out; He that spread forth the\nearth, and that which cometh out of it; He that giveth breath unto the\npeople upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: I the Lord have\ncalled thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep\nthee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\nGentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the\nprison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.\u201d Verse\n5-7. Christians are to seek their light from the word of God and then\nin faith go forth to give that light to those who sit in darkness.\nSanitarium, California,\nMay 24, 1908\nChapter 7\u2014Circulate the Publications [65]\nIn the night of March 2, 1907, many things were revealed to me\nregarding the value of our publications on present truth and the small\neffort that is being made by our brethren and sisters in the churches\nfor their wide circulation.\nI have been repeatedly shown that our presses should now be\nconstantly employed in publishing light and truth. This is a time of\nspiritual darkness in the churches of the world. Ignorance of divine\nthings has hidden God and the truth from view. The forces of evil\nare gathering in strength. Satan flatters his co-workers that he will\ndo a work that will captivate the world. While partial inactivity has\ncome upon the church, Satan and his hosts are intensely active. The\nprofessed Christian churches are not converting the world; for they\nare themselves corrupted with selfishness and pride, and need to\nfeel the converting power of God in their midst before they can lead\nothers to a purer or higher standard.\nAn Encouraging Experience\nThe afternoon of March 2 I spent in counsel with Brother and\nSister S. N. Haskell, discussing the work in Oakland and their plans\nto go East to spend some time in South Lancaster. After our visit\nI was weary and retired early. I was suffering with rheumatism in\nmy left side and could get no rest because of the pain. I turned from\nside to side, trying to find ease from the suffering. There was a pain\nin my heart that portended no good for me. At last I fell asleep.\nAbout half past nine I attempted to turn myself, and as I did\nso, I became aware that my body was entirely free from pain. As [66]\nI turned from side to side, and moved my hands, I experienced an\nextraordinary freedom and lightness that I cannot describe. The\nroom was filled with light, a most beautiful, soft, azure light, and I\nseemed to be in the arms of heavenly beings.\n59\n60 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nThis peculiar light I have experienced in the past in times of\nspecial blessing, but this time it was more distinct, more impressive,\nand I felt such peace, peace so full and abundant no words can\nexpress it. I raised myself into a sitting posture, and I saw that I was\nsurrounded by a bright cloud, white as snow, the edges of which\nwere tinged with a deep pink. The softest, sweetest music was filling\nthe air, and I recognized the music as the singing of the angels. Then\na V oice spoke to me, saying: \u201cFear not; I am your Saviour. Holy\nangels are all about you.\u201d\n\u201cThen this is heaven,\u201d I said, \u201cand now I can be at rest. I shall\nhave no more messages to bear, no more misrepresentations to\nendure. Everything will be easy now, and I shall enjoy peace and\nrest. Oh, what inexpressible peace fills my soul! Is this indeed\nheaven? Am I one of God\u2019s little children? and shall I always have\nthis peace?\u201d\nThe V oice replied: \u201cYour work is not yet done.\u201d\nAgain I fell asleep, and when I awoke I heard music, and I\nwanted to sing. Then someone passed my door, and I wondered if\nthat person saw the light. After a time the light passed away, but the\npeace remained.\nAfter a while I fell asleep again. This time I seemed to be in a\ncouncil meeting where our book work was being discussed. There\nwere a number of our brethren present, leaders in our work, and Elder\nHaskell and his wife were there consulting together and with the\nbrethren about the circulation of our books, tracts, and periodicals. [67]\nElder Haskell was presenting strong reasons why the books\nwhich contain the knowledge that has been communicated to Sister\nWhite\u2014the books containing the special message to come to the\nworld at this present time\u2014should be more freely circulated. \u201cWhy,\u201d\nhe inquired, \u201cdo not our people appreciate and circulate more widely\nthe books bearing the divine credentials? Why is not a specialty\nmade of the books containing the warnings regarding Satan\u2019s work?\nWhy do we not give greater effort to circulating the books that point\nout Satan\u2019s plans to counterwork the work of God, that uncover his\nplans and point out his deceptions? The moral evils of his deceptions\nare to be removed by opening the eyes of the people so that they\nshall discern the situation and the dangers of our times; so that they\nCirculate the Publications 61\nshall make diligent effort to lay hold by faith upon Christ and His\nrighteousness.\u201d\nA messenger from heaven stood in our midst, and he spoke\nwords of warning and instruction. He made us clearly understand\nthat the gospel of the kingdom is the message for which the world\nis perishing and that this message, as contained in our publications\nalready in print and those yet to be issued, should be circulated\namong the people who are nigh and afar off.\nDangers in Speculative Study\nThe light of truth which God designs shall come to the people of\nthe world at this time is not that which the world\u2019s men of learning\nare seeking to impart, for these men in their research often arrive at\nerroneous conclusions and in their study of many authors become\nenthused with theories that are of satanic origin. Satan, clothed in [68]\nthe garb of an angel of light, presents for the study of the human\nmind subjects which seem very interesting and which are full of\nscientific mystery. In the investigation of these subjects, men are led\nto accept erroneous conclusions and to unite with seducing spirits\nin the work of propounding new theories which lead away from the\ntruth.\nThere is danger that the false sentiments expressed in the books\nthat they have been reading will sometimes be interwoven by our\nministers, teachers, and editors with their arguments, discourses, and\npublications, under the belief that they are the same in principle as\nthe teachings of the Spirit of truth. The book Living Temple is an\nillustration of this work, the writer of which declared in its support\nthat its teachings were the same as those found in the writings of\nMrs. White. Again and again we shall be called to meet the influence\nof men who are studying sciences of satanic origin, through which\nSatan is working to make a nonentity of God and of Christ.\nThe Father and the Son each have a personality. Christ declared:\n\u201cI and My Father are one.\u201d Yet it was the Son of God who came to the\nworld in human form. Laying aside His royal robe and kingly crown,\nHe clothed His divinity with humanity, that humanity through His\ninfinite sacrifice might become partakers of the divine nature and\nescape the corruption that is in the world through lust.\n62 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nChrist was tempted in all points as man is tempted, but at no\ntime did He bring against the tempter a railing accusation. To every\ntemptation He presented the word of the Lord. \u201cIt is written\u201d was\nHis never-failing weapon. We, as the representatives of Christ, are\nto meet every thrust of the enemy with the word of the living God.[69]\nNever should we allow ourselves to follow the trail of the serpent by\nusing his scientific arguments. Satan can never gain advantage of\nthe child of God who relies on the word of God as his defense.\nOur Counselor impressed deeply on our minds that God\u2019s com-\nmandment-keeping people must be sanctified through the truth and\nthat truth must ever be given the foremost place. We must not forget\nthat Satan still lives to exercise his deceptive power through false\nscience.\nChrist was the Majesty of heaven, the Prince of life; yet He\nhumbled Himself as a man and became obedient to every law of\nGod. He passed over the ground that every man must tread who\ntakes His name, and came forth from His trial pure and untainted by\nsin. He was our example in all things.\nThe first advent of Christ and His life of ministry are not studied\nas they should be. His life was one of self-denial, in which truth in\nall its noble qualities was expressed. He lived to bless humanity by\nevery good word and work.\nDignity of the Book Work\nThe work of bookmaking is a grand and good work; but it has\nnot always stood in the high and holy position that God designed it\nshould occupy, because self has been interwoven with the work of\nsome who have engaged in it. The book work should be the means\nof quickly giving the sacred light of present truth to the world. The\npublications that come forth from our presses today are to be of such\na character as to strengthen every pin and pillar of the faith that was\nestablished by the word of God and by the revelations of His Spirit.\nThe truth that God has given for His people in these last days\nshould keep them firm when there come into the church those who[70]\npresent false theories. The truth that has stood firm against the\nattacks of the enemy for more than half a century must still be the\nconfidence and comfort of God\u2019s people.\nCirculate the Publications 63\nOur evidence to nonprofessors that we have the truth of the word\nof God will be given in a life of strict self-denial. We must not make\na mockery of our faith, but ever keep before us the example of Him\nwho, though He was the Prince of heaven, stooped to a life of self-\ndenial and sacrifice to vindicate the righteousness of His Father\u2019s\nword. Let us each resolve to do our best, that the light of our good\nworks may shine forth to the world.\nUnity in Progress\nPerfect agreement should exist in the plans laid for the publica-\ntion of our books and periodicals, that the light which they contain\nmay be quickly carried everywhere to the nominal churches and to\nthe world. Much more should have been accomplished in the sale of\nour books than we see accomplished today.\nOur ministers should call upon the church members to let the\ntruth triumph. \u201cArise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of\nthe Lord is risen upon thee. For, behold, the darkness shall cover\nthe earth, and gross darkness the people: but the Lord shall arise\nupon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee. And the Gentiles\nshall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising.\u201d\nIsaiah 60:1-3. Unity and love will accomplish wonderful things for\nthe believers. Will not our churches arouse and give the last warning\nmessage to the world?\nOur Relief Books\nChrist\u2019s Object Lessons is a book that speaks for itself, and it\nhas accomplished a good work. As it has been sold, and the object [71]\nof its sale related, money has been received that has relieved the\nindebtedness of our schools. But more than this, many by reading\nthe book have been blessed by its lessons of truth, and many others\nwill be blessed by reading it.\nThe book Ministry of Healing may do the same work for our\nsanitariums and health institutions that Christ\u2019s Object Lessons has\ndone for our schools. This book contains the wisdom of the Great\nPhysician. To me it has been a precious privilege to donate my work\n64 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\non these books to the cause of God. In the future there should be\nwell-planned and persevering efforts made to increase their sale.\nLift the Debts\nGod designs that we shall learn lessons from the failures of the\npast. It is not pleasing to Him to have debts rest upon His institutions.\nWe have reached the time when we must give character to the work\nby refusing to erect large and costly buildings. We are not to copy\nthe mistakes of the past and become more and more involved in\ndebt. We are rather to endeavor to clear off the indebtedness that still\nremains on our institutions. Our churches can help in this matter if\nthey will. Those members to whom the Lord has given means can\ninvest their money in the cause without interest or at a low rate of\ninterest, and by their freewill offerings they can help to support the\nwork. The Lord asks you to return cheerfully to Him a portion of\nthe goods He has lent you, and thus become His almoners.\nAnother View of the Book Work\nAfterward we were in camp meetings and in large meetings in\nour churches, where the ministers presented clearly the perils of the\ntimes in which we live and the great importance of making haste[72]\nin the circulation of our literature. In response to these appeals\nthe brethren and sisters came forward and purchased many books.\nSome took a few, and some purchased large quantities. Most of\nthe purchasers paid for the books they took. A few arranged to pay\nafterward.\nBecause books were being sold at low prices, some being espe-\ncially reduced for the occasion, many were purchased, and some by\npersons not of our faith. They said: \u201cIt must be that these books con-\ntain a message for us. These people are willing to make sacrifices in\norder that we may have them, and we will secure them for ourselves\nand our friends.\u201d\nBut dissatisfaction was expressed by some of our own people.\nOne said: \u201cA stop must be put to this work, or our business will be\nspoiled.\u201d As one brother was carrying away an armful of books, a\ncanvasser laid his hand upon his arm and said: \u201cMy brother, what\nCirculate the Publications 65\nare you doing with so many books?\u201d Then I heard the voice of our\nCounselor saying: \u201cForbid them not. This is a work that should\nbe done. The end is near. Already much time has been lost, when\nthese books should have been in circulation. Sell them far and near.\nScatter them like the leaves of autumn. This work is to continue\nwithout the forbiddings of anyone. Souls are perishing out of Christ.\nLet them be warned of His soon appearing in the clouds of heaven.\u201d\nSome of the workers continued to appear much cast down. One\nwas weeping and said: \u201cThese are doing the publishing work an\ninjustice by purchasing these books at so low a price; besides, this\nwork is depriving us of some of the revenue by which our work is\nsustained.\u201d The V oice replied: \u201cYou are meeting with no loss. These\nworkers who take the books at reduced prices could not obtain so [73]\nready sale for them except it be at this so-called sacrifice. Many are\nnow purchasing for their friends and for themselves who otherwise\nwould not think of buying.\u201d\nA Caution\nThen instruction was given to Elder Haskell that in his anxiety\nto supply the people with the precious truth contained in his books,\nin his desire that all should feel that the books are worth more than\nthey cost, and that all should be encouraged to give them a wide\ncirculation, he was selling his books too cheap, and thus making his\nown burden too heavy.\nOur Counselor said: \u201cThe books should be sold in such a way\nthat the author will not be left barehanded and that the publishing\nhouse shall have a proper margin so that it will have means to carry\non its work.\u201d\nA Parable for Our Study\n\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an house-\nholder,\u201d Christ declared, \u201cwhich went out early in the morning to\nhire laborers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the\nlaborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And he\nwent out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the\n66 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nmarket place, and said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and\nwhatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.\n\u201cAgain he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did\nlikewise. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others\nstanding idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day\nidle? They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith\nunto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that\nshall ye receive. So when even was come, the Lord of the vineyard [74]\nsaith unto his steward, Call the laborers, and give them their hire,\nbeginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were\nhired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.\n\u201cBut when the first came, they supposed that they should have\nreceived more; and they likewise received every man a penny. And\nwhen they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of\nthe house, saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou\nhast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat\nof the day. But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee\nno wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny? Take that thine\nis, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee. Is it\nnot lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil,\nbecause I am good? So the last shall be first, and the first last: for\nmany be called, but few chosen.\u201d Matthew 20:1-16.\nBlessed will be the recompense of grace to those who have\nwrought for God in the simplicity of faith and love. The value of\nservice to God is measured by the spirit in which it is rendered,\nrather than by the length of time spent in labor.\nLight for All\nI am very desirous that the light contained in my books shall\ncome to every soul possible, for God has sent the message for all.\nThese books contain precious lessons in Christian experience. I\nwould not dare forbid that these books be sold on special occasions\nat a low price, lest I should hinder the reading of the books, and thus\nwithhold the light from some soul who might be converted to the\ntruth. I have no forbiddings to place on the work of circulating our[75]\nbooks. Let the light be placed on the candlestick, that it may give\nlight to all that are in the house.\nCirculate the Publications 67\nA Lesson in Commercialism\n\u201cAnd Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them\nthat sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the\nmoney-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto\nthem, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but\nye have made it a den of thieves.\n\u201cAnd the blind and the lame came to Him in the temple; and\nHe healed them. And when the chief priests and scribes saw the\nwonderful things that He did, and the children crying in the temple,\nand saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased,\nand said unto Him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith\nunto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and\nsucklings Thou hast perfected praise?\u201d Matthew 21:12-16.\nSanitarium, California,\nMay 4, 1908\n* * * * *\nOne point that should never be forgotten by our workers is that\nthe Lord Jesus Christ is our chief director. He has outlined a plan\nby which the schools may be relieved of their indebtedness, and He\nwill not vindicate the course of those who lay this plan aside for lack\nof confidence in its success. When His people will come up unitedly\nto the help of His cause in the earth, no good thing that God has\npromised will be withheld from them.\nChapter 8\u2014A Broader View[76]\nIn carrying forward the Lord\u2019s work at home and abroad, those\nin positions of responsibility must plan wisely, so as to make the\nbest possible use of men and of means. The burden of sustaining\nthe work in many of the foreign fields must be largely borne by our\nconferences in the homeland. These conferences should have means\nwith which to assist in opening new fields, where the testing truths\nof the third angel\u2019s message have never yet penetrated. Within the\npast few years, doors have been thrown open as if by magic; and\nmen and women are needed to enter these doors and begin earnest\nwork for the salvation of souls.\nOur educational institutions can do much toward meeting the\ndemand for trained workers for these mission fields. Wise plans\nshould be laid to strengthen the work done in our training centers.\nStudy should be given to the best methods for fitting consecrated\nyoung men and young women to bear responsibility and to win souls\nfor Christ. They should be taught how to meet the people and how\nto present the third angel\u2019s message in an attractive manner. And in\nthe management of financial matters they should be taught lessons\nthat will help them when they are sent to isolated fields where they\nmust suffer many privations and practice the strictest economy.\nThe Lord has instituted a plan whereby many of the students in\nour schools can learn practical lessons needful to success in afterlife.\nHe has given them the privilege of handling precious books that\nhave been dedicated for the advancement of our educational and\nsanitarium work. In the very handling of these books, the youth\nwill meet with many experiences that will teach them how to cope[77]\nwith problems that await them in the regions beyond. During their\nschool life, as they canvass for these books, many may learn how to\napproach people courteously and how to exercise tact in conversing\nwith them on different points of present truth. And as they meet with\na degree of success financially, some will learn lessons of thrift and\n68\nBroader View 69\neconomy, which will be of great advantage to them when they are\nsent out as missionaries.\nThe students who take up the work of selling Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons and Ministry of Healing will need to study the book they\nexpect to sell. As they familiarize their minds with the subject matter\nof the book in hand and endeavor to practice its teachings they will\ndevelop in knowledge and spiritual power. The messages in these\nbooks contain the light that God has revealed to me to give to the\nworld. The teachers in our schools should encourage the students\nto make a careful study of every chapter. They should teach these\ntruths to their students and seek to inspire the youth with a love for\nthe precious thoughts the Lord has entrusted to us to communicate\nto the world.\nThus the preparation for handling these books, and the daily ex-\nperiences gained while bringing them to the attention of the people,\nwill prove an invaluable schooling to those who take part in this line\nof effort. Under the blessing of God the youth will obtain a fitting\nup for service in the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\nThere is a special work to be done for our young people by those\nbearing responsibility in local churches throughout the conferences.\nWhen the church officers see promising youth who are desirous of\nfitting themselves for usefulness in the Lord\u2019s service, but whose par-\nents are unable to send them to school, they have a duty to perform [78]\nin studying how to give help and encouragement. They should take\ncounsel with parents and youth, and unite in planning wisely. Some\nyouth may be best fitted to engage in home missionary work. There\nis a wide field of usefulness in the distribution of our literature and\nin bringing the third angel\u2019s message to the attention of friends and\nneighbors. Other youth should be encouraged to enter the canvassing\nwork to sell our larger books. Some may have qualifications that\nwould make them valuable helpers in our institutions. And in many\ninstances, if promising youth were wisely encouraged and properly\ndirected, they could be led to earn their own schooling by taking up\nthe sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons or Ministry of Healing.\nIn selling these books the youth would be acting as missionaries,\nfor they would be bringing precious light to the notice of the peo-\nple of the world. At the same time they would be earning money\nto enable them to attend school, where they could continue their\n70 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\npreparation for wider usefulness in the Lord\u2019s cause. In the school\nthey would receive encouragement and inspiration from teachers\nand students to continue their work of selling books; and when the\ntime came for them to leave school, they would have received a prac-\ntical training fitting them for the hard, earnest, self-sacrificing labor\nthat has to be done in many foreign fields, where the third angel\u2019s\nmessage must be carried under difficult and trying circumstances.\nHow much better is this plan than for students to go through\nschool without obtaining a practical education in field work, and,\nat the end of their course, leave under a burden of debt, with but\nlittle realization of the difficulties they will have to meet in new and\nuntried fields! How hard it will be for them to meet the financial[79]\nproblems that are connected with pioneer work in foreign lands! And\nwhat a burden someone will have to carry until the debts incurred\nby the student have been paid!\nOn the other hand, how much might be gained, if the self-sup-\nporting plan were followed! The student would often be enabled\nto leave the educational institution nearly or wholly free from per-\nsonal indebtedness; the finances of the school would be in a more\nprosperous condition; and the lessons learned by the student while\npassing through these experiences in the home field would be of\nuntold value to him in foreign fields.\nLet wise plans be laid to help worthy students to earn their own\nschooling by handling these books, if they so desire. Those who\nearn sufficient means in this way to pay their way through a course\nat one of our training schools will gain a most valuable practical\nexperience that will help fit them for pioneer missionary work in\nother fields.\nA great work is to be done in our world in a short time, and\nwe must study to understand and appreciate, more than we have\nin past years, the providence of God in placing in our hands the\nprecious volumes, Christ\u2019s Object Lessons and Ministry of Healing,\nas a means of helping worthy students to meet their expenses while\nin training, as well as a means of liquidating the indebtedness on our\neducational and medical institutions.\nGreat blessings are in store for us as we wisely handle these\nprecious books given us for the advancement of the cause of present\ntruth. And as we labor in accordance with the Lord\u2019s plan we shall\nBroader View 71\nfind that many consecrated youth will be fitted to enter the regions be-\nyond as practical missionaries; and, at the same time, the conferences [80]\nin the home field will have means with which to contribute liberally\nto the support of the work that shall be undertaken in new territory.\nSanitarium, California,\nApril 17, 1908\n* * * * *\nGod desires that the sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons shall be\nrecognized by all our people as His method of relieving our schools\nfrom debt. It is because this plan has been neglected that we now feel\nso keenly our lack of means for the advancing work. Had the schools\navailed themselves of the provision thus made for them, there would\nbe more money in the school treasuries, and more money in the\nhands of God\u2019s servants, with which to relieve the necessities of\nother needy departments of the cause; and, best of all, teachers and\nstudents would have received the very lessons that they needed to\nlearn in the Master\u2019s service.\n* * * * *\nIn the cities within easy reach of our sanitariums and training\nschools a mission field is open to us that we have as yet only touched\nwith the tips of our fingers. In some of these places, a good beginning\nhas been made. But it was God\u2019s purpose that by the sale ofMinistry\nof Healing and Christ\u2019s Object Lessonsmuch means should be raised\nfor the work of our sanitariums and schools, and that our people\nmight thereby be left more free to donate of their means for the\nopening of the work in new missionary fields. If our people will\nnow engage in the sale of these books as they ought, we shall have\nmuch more means than we now have to carry the work in the way\nthe Lord designed that it should be carried.\nChapter 9\u2014Camp Meetings and Our Publications[81]\nIn connection with our camp meetings in past years, God\u2019s ser-\nvants have improved many precious opportunities for instructing our\npeople in practical methods of presenting the saving truths of the\nthird angel\u2019s message to their friends and acquaintances. Many have\nbeen taught how to labor as self-supporting missionaries in their\nhome communities. Many have returned home from these annual\ngatherings to labor with greater zeal and intelligence than hitherto.\nIt would be pleasing to God if far more of this practical instruc-\ntion were given the church members who attend our camp meetings,\nthan has usually been given in years past. Our general workers and\nour brethren and sisters in every conference should remember that\none of the objects of our annual gatherings is that all may gain a\nknowledge of practical methods of personal missionary work. This\nphase of our camp meetings is outlined inTestimonies for the Church,\nvolume 6, as follows:\n\u201cGod has committed to our hands a most sacred work, and we\nneed to meet together to receive instruction, that we may be fitted\nto perform this work. We need to understand what part we shall\nindividually be called upon to act in building up the cause of God\nin the earth, in vindicating God\u2019s holy law, and in lifting up the\nSaviour as \u2018the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the\nworld.\u2019 John 1:29. We need to meet together and receive the divine\ntouch, that we may understand our work in the home. Parents need\nto understand how they may send forth from the sanctuary of the\nhome their sons and daughters so trained and educated that they will\nbe fitted to shine as lights in the world. We need to understand in[82]\nregard to the division of labor and how each part of the work is to\nbe carried forward. Each one should understand the part he is to\nact, that there may be harmony of plan and of labor in the combined\nwork of all.\u201d\u2014Pages 32, 33.\n\u201cProperly conducted, the camp meeting is a school where pastors,\nelders, and deacons can learn to do more perfect work for the Master.\n72\nCamp Meetings and Our Publications 73\nIt should be a school where the members of the church, old and\nyoung, are given opportunity to learn the way of the Lord more\nperfectly, a place where believers can receive an education that will\nhelp them to help others....\n\u201cThe best help that ministers can give the members of our\nchurches is not sermonizing, but planning work for them. Give\neach one something to do for others. Help all to see that as receivers\nof the grace of Christ they are under obligation to work for Him. And\nlet all be taught how to work. Especially should those who are newly\ncome to the faith be educated to become laborers together with God.\nIf set to work, the despondent will soon forget their despondency;\nthe weak will become strong, the ignorant intelligent, and all will\nbe prepared to present the truth as it is in Jesus. They will find an\nunfailing helper in Him who has promised to save all that come unto\nHim.\u201d\u2014Pages 49, 50.\nIn some of our conferences the leaders have hesitated to intro-\nduce these practical methods of instruction. Some are naturally\ninclined to sermonize rather than to teach. But on such occasions\nas our annual camp meetings we must never lose sight of the op-\nportunities afforded for teaching the believers how to do practical\nmissionary work in the place where they may live. In many instances\nit would be well to set apart certain men to carry the burden of differ-\nent lines of educational work at these meetings. Let some help the [83]\npeople to learn how to give Bible readings and to conduct cottage\nmeetings. Let others bear the burden of teaching the people how to\npractice the principles of health and temperance, and how to give\ntreatments to the sick. Still others may labor in the interests of our\nperiodical and book work. And let chosen workers take a special\ninterest in teaching many how to handleChrist\u2019s Object Lessons and\nMinistry of Healing.\nMany have never learned how to sell the books dedicated to the\nadvancement of our institutional work. But such should not excuse\nthemselves. They should study diligently how they may do their part\nfaithfully in connection with the circulation of these precious books.\nOur schools and sanitariums must be conducted on a high plane of\nefficiency, and a solemn responsibility rests upon us all to help place\nthese institutions on vantage ground by giving the relief books a\nwide circulation. God will be glorified by everyone who takes an\n74 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nactive interest in the work of placing these books in the hands of the\nmultitudes who are in need of the saving truths of the gospel.\nThe opportunity we have of doing good by striving to carry out\nthe Lord\u2019s plan for the relief of our schools and sanitariums has\nbeen presented to me over and over again in connection with the\nSouthern California Conference. The conditions there are unusually\nfavorable for a long-continued effort to push the sale of Christ\u2019s\nObject Lessons and Ministry of Healing. Our brethren and sisters\nin Southern California should never weary of this plan for raising\nmoney to meet the debts that have accumulated. The students of the\nFernando school, and the nurses of the three sanitariums that have\nbeen established, can ill afford to lose the precious experiences in[84]\nmissionary work that come to those who handle the relief books.\nAnd the conference can ill afford to lose the results, spiritual as well\nas financial, that would accompany a continued effort of this sort.\nBut years have passed, and students who should have been gain-\ning rich experiences in actual missionary work have not been encour-\naged to launch out heartily in the sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons.\nChurch members in many places have daily met with strangers,\u2014\ntourists, men and women of means and influence,\u2014and yet such\nopportunities as these for circulating Christ\u2019s Object Lessons and\nMinistry of Healinghave been allowed to pass by unimproved. Many\nhonesthearted persons who could have been reached by diligent,\nwholehearted effort have not been given the light of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage.\nHad the Lord\u2019s plan been followed, His name would have been\nglorified, and many spiritual victories would have been won. Those\nhaving means would have been more able and willing to come up to\nthe help of the Lord when He was leading out in an extraordinary\nmanner in the establishment of strong medical missionary centers in\nthe vicinity of great thoroughfares of travel. Students would have\nreceived a training that would have greatly increased their efficiency\nas practical missionaries at home and abroad. Churches would have\nbeen revived with spiritual blessings. Many would have been won to\nthe truth, and these would have brought into the cause their influence\nand their means.\nIn such places as Southern California, where thousands of\ntourists, many of them in search of health and strength, are con-\nCamp Meetings and Our Publications 75\nstantly coming and going, special and continuous efforts should be\nput forth to scatter the bright rays of light and truth. The books Min-\nistry of Healing and Christ\u2019s Object Lessons are peculiarly adapted [85]\nfor use in tourist centers, and everything possible should be done to\nplace copies of these works in the hands of those who have leisure\nand inclination to read. Especially do those who are seeking for\nrestoration of health need the book Ministry of Healing. Every favor\nable opportunity for reaching this class is to be improved.\nMy heart has rejoiced as I have learned of a revival of the relief\nwork in Southern California during the past few months. At Loma\nLinda some of the nurses have been given a special training for the\nwork of selling Ministry of Healing; and as they have visited homes\nin the neighboring cities and villages, the blessing of heaven has\nrested richly upon them, and favorable impressions have been made\nin behalf of our people and their work.\nAt the Fernando school the teachers have recently led out in\nreviving an interest in the sale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons. Bands of\nstudents, after prayerful study of the book, have visited Los Ange-\nles in company with their teachers and have gained a sound, solid\nexperience which they prize above silver and gold. This kind of\nwork is, in fact, one of the means God has ordained for giving our\nyouth a missionary training; and those who neglect to improve such\nopportunities lose out of their lives a chapter of experience of the\nhighest value. By entering heartily into this work, students can learn\nhow to approach with tact and discretion men and women in all\nwalks of life, how to deal with them courteously, and how to lead\nthem to give favorable consideration to the truths contained in the\nbooks that are sold.\nOur greatest burden should be, not the raising of money, but the\nsalvation of souls; and to this end we should do all in our power to\nteach students how to lead souls to a knowledge of the third angel\u2019s [86]\nmessage. When we are successful in the work of soulsaving, those\nwho are added to the faith will, in turn, use their ability in giving\nthe truth to others. When we labor diligently for the salvation of our\nfellow men, God will prosper our every effort.\nTo the presidents of conferences, and to others in positions of\nleading responsibility, I would say: Let us do all in our power to\nimpress upon the teachers connected with our educational institu-\n76 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\ntions the great value of the blessings in store for those who seek\ndiligently to make the best possible use of the gift, Christ\u2019s Object\nLessons. Let us encourage the teachers to unite with many of their\nstudents in a prayerful study of this book, preparatory to going out\nwith them into active field work. Let us help the educators to un-\nderstand their responsibility in this matter. Let us do all we can to\nrevive the Christ\u2019s Object Lessons work and to inaugurate plans for\nan active campaign with Ministry of Healing.\nAs teachers and students engage heartily in this line of work,\nthey will gain an experience that will fit them to do valuable service\nin connection with our camp meetings. Through the instruction that\nthey can give to the believers in attendance, and through the sale\nof many books in the places where such meetings are held, those\nwho have been in the school will be able to do their part in reaching\nthe multitudes who need to be given the third angel\u2019s message. Let\nteachers and students nobly bear their share of the burden of showing\nour own people how to communicate the message to their friends\nand neighbors.\nWhen we follow plans of the Lord\u2019s devising \u201cwe are laborers\ntogether with God.\u201d Whatever our position,\u2014whether presidents\nof conferences, ministers, teachers, students, or lay members,\u2014[87]\nwe are held accountable by the Lord for making the most of our\nopportunities to enlighten those in need of present truth. And one\nof the principal agencies He has ordained for our use is the printed\npage. In our schools and sanitariums, in our home churches, and\nparticularly in our annual camp meetings, we must learn to make\na wise use of this precious agency. With patient diligence chosen\nworkers must instruct our people how to approach unbelievers in a\nkindly, winning way and how to place in their hands literature in\nwhich the truth for this time is presented with clearness and power.\nMy brethren and sisters, let us not become weary in well-doing.\nDuring His earthly ministry, Christ traveled on foot from place to\nplace. Wearied, as He ofttimes was, His human nature taxed to the\nuttermost, yet He was ever ready to heal all who came unto Him,\nand to teach them the way of life eternal. Though often physically\nexhausted, He left not His work. There was a world to be saved.\nHe made every sacrifice possible, in order that light and truth might\nshine forth.\nCamp Meetings and Our Publications 77\nThe Lord God of Israel desires us to link up in holy union with\nHimself and exercise the living faith that works by love and purifies\nthe soul. He desires that we shall be a working corps of laborers\nendowed with adaptability for His service, and to such He promises\npower to win a glorious victory for Him.\nSanitarium, California,\nJuly 10, 1908.\n* * * * *\nThe men who stand as leaders in any part of the solemn work\nof the last gospel message must cultivate and cherish broad views\nand ideas. It is the privilege of all who bear responsibilities in the\nwork of the gospel to be apt learners in the school of Christ. The [88]\nprofessed follower of Christ must not be led by the dictates of his\nown will; his mind must be trained to think Christ\u2019s thoughts and\nenlightened to comprehend the will and way of God. Such a believer\nwill be a follower of Christ\u2019s methods of work.\nOur brethren should not forget that the wisdom of God has made\nprovision for our schools in a way that will bring blessing to all who\nparticipate in the enterprise. The book Christ\u2019s Object Lessons was\ndonated to the educational work, that the students and other friends\nof the schools might handle these books and by their sale raise much\nof the means needed to lift the school indebtedness. But this plan\nhas not been presented to our schools as it should have been; the\nteachers and students have not been educated to take hold of this\nbook and courageously push its sale for the benefit of the educational\nwork.\nLong ago the teachers and students in our schools should have\nlearned to take advantage of the opportunity to raise means by the\nsale of Christ\u2019s Object Lessons. In selling these books the students\nwill serve the cause of God, and, while doing this, by the dissemina-\ntion of precious light, they will learn invaluable lessons in Christian\nexperience. All our schools should now come into line and earnestly\nendeavor to carry out the plan presented to us for the education of\nworkers, for the relief of the schools, and for the winning of souls to\nthe cause of Christ.\n78 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nSection 3\u2014The Work in the Cities [89]\n[In the five articles in this section there have been gathered to-\ngether and grouped in convenient order some of the many instructive,\ncheering, and inspiring testimonies regarding work in the cities. The\nstatements included in this compilation have been found in special\ntestimonies, in articles published in our periodicals, in the reports of\nsermons at the 1909 General Conference, and in letters to workers\nin the large cities.]\n\u201cI heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who\nwill go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me. \u201d Isaiah 6:8.\nChapter 10\u2014Conditions in the Cities\nThere is coming rapidly and surely an almost universal guilt\nupon the inhabitants of the cities because of the steady increase of\ndetermined wickedness. We are living in the midst of an \u201cepidemic\nof crime\u201d at which thoughtful, God-fearing men everywhere stand\naghast. The corruption that prevails is beyond the power of the hu-\nman pen to describe. Every day brings fresh revelations of political\nstrife, bribery, and fraud; every day brings its heartsickening record\nof violence and lawlessness, of indifference to human suffering; of\nbrutal, fiendish destruction of human life. Every day testifies to the\nincrease of insanity, murder, and suicide.\nThe cities of today are fast becoming like Sodom and Gomorrah.\nHolidays are numerous; the whirl of excitement and pleasure attracts\nthousands from the sober duties of life. The exciting sports\u2014the-\natergoing, horse racing, gambling, liquor drinking and reveling\u2014\nstimulate every passion to activity.\nThe youth are swept away by the popular current. Those who[90]\nlearn to love amusement for its own sake open the door to a flood of\ntemptations. They give themselves up to social gaiety and thought-\nless mirth. They are led on from one form of dissipation to another,\nuntil they lose both the desire and the capacity for a life of useful-\nness. Their religious aspirations are chilled; their spiritual life is\ndarkened. All the nobler faculties of the soul, all that link man with\nthe spiritual world, are debased.\nThrough the working of trusts and the results of labor unions and\nstrikes, the conditions of life in the cities are constantly becoming\nmore and more difficult.\nThe intense passion for money getting, the thirst for display, the\nluxury and extravagance\u2014all are forces that, with the great mass\nof mankind, are turning the mind from life\u2019s true purpose. They\nare opening the door to a thousand evils. Many, absorbed in their\ninterest in worldly treasures, become insensible to the claims of God\nand the needs of their fellow men. They regard their wealth as a\n80\nConditions in the Cities 81\nmeans of glorifying self. They add house to house and land to land;\nthey fill their homes with luxury, while all about them are human\nbeings in misery and crime, in disease and death.\nBy every species of oppression and extortion, men are piling up\ncolossal fortunes, while the cries of starving humanity are coming up\nbefore God. There are multitudes struggling with poverty, compelled\nto labor hard for small wages, unable to secure the barest necessities\nof life. Toil and deprivation, with no hope of better things, make\ntheir burden heavy. When pain and sickness are added, the burden is\nalmost unbearable. Care-worn and oppressed, they know not where\nto turn for relief.\nThe Scriptures describe the condition of the world just before [91]\nChrist\u2019s second coming. James the apostle pictures the greed and\noppression that will prevail. He says: \u201cGo to now, ye rich men....\nYe have heaped treasure together for the last days. Behold, the hire\nof the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you\nkept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped\nare entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth. Ye have lived in\npleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your\nhearts, as in a day of slaughter. Ye have condemned and killed the\njust; and he doth not resist you.\u201d James 5:1-6.\nThis is a picture of what exists today. \u201cJudgment is turned away\nbackward, and justice standeth afar off: for truth is fallen in the street,\nand equity cannot enter. Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth\nfrom evil maketh himself a prey.\u201d Isaiah 59:14, 15.\nEven the church, which should be the pillar and ground of the\ntruth, is found encouraging a selfish love of pleasure. When money\nis raised for religious purposes, to what means do many churches\nresort? To bazaars, suppers, fancy fairs, even to lotteries and like\ndevices. Often the place set apart for God\u2019s worship is desecrated by\nfeasting and drinking, buying, selling, and merrymaking. Respect\nfor the house of God and reverence for His worship are lessened in\nthe minds of the youth. The barriers of self-restraint are weakened.\nSelfishness, appetite, the love of display, are appealed to, and they\nstrengthen as they are indulged.\nFrom age to age the Lord has made known the manner of His\nworking. When a crisis has come, He has revealed Himself and has\ninterposed to hinder the working out of Satan\u2019s plans. With nations,\n82 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwith families, and with individuals He has often permitted matters\nto come to a crisis, that His interference might become marked.[92]\nThen He has made it manifest that there is a God in Israel who will\nmaintain His law and vindicate His people.\nIn the antediluvian world human agencies brought in all manner\nof devisings and ingenious practices to make of no effect the law of\nJehovah. They cast aside His authority because it interfered with\ntheir schemes. As in the days before the Flood, so now the time is\nright upon us when the Lord must reveal His omnipotent power. In\nthis time of prevailing iniquity we may know that the last great crisis\nis at hand. When defiance against God\u2019s law is almost universal,\nwhen His people are oppressed and afflicted by their fellow men, the\nLord will interpose.\nSatan is not asleep; he is wide awake to make of no effect the\nsure word of prophecy. With skill and deceptive power he is working\nto counterwork the expressed will of God, made plain in His word.\nFor years Satan has been gaining control of human minds through\nsubtle sophistries that he has devised to take the place of the truth.\nIn this time of peril, rightdoers, in the fear of God, will glorify His\nname by repeating the words of David: \u201cIt is time for Thee, Lord, to\nwork: for they have made void Thy law.\u201d Psalm 119:126.\nThe Judgments of God on our Cities\nWhile at Loma Linda, California, April 16, 1906, there passed\nbefore me a most wonderful representation. During a vision of the\nnight, I stood on an eminence, from which I could see houses shaken\nlike a reed in the wind. Buildings, great and small, were falling to\nthe ground. Pleasure resorts, theaters, hotels, and the homes of the\nwealthy were shaken and shattered. Many lives were blotted out of[93]\nexistence, and the air was filled with the shrieks of the injured and\nthe terrified.\nThe destroying angels of God were at work. One touch, and\nbuildings, so thoroughly constructed that men regarded them as\nsecure against every danger, quickly became heaps of rubbish. There\nwas no assurance of safety in any place. I did not feel in any special\nperil, but the awfulness of the scenes that passed before me I cannot\nConditions in the Cities 83\nfind words to describe. It seemed that the forbearance of God was\nexhausted and that the Judgment day had come.\nThe angel that stood at my side then instructed me that but few\nhave any conception of the wickedness existing in our world today,\nand especially the wickedness in the large cities. He declared that\nthe Lord has appointed a time when He will visit transgressors in\nwrath for persistent disregard of His law.\nTerrible as was the representation that passed before me, that\nwhich impressed itself most vividly upon my mind was the instruc-\ntion given in connection with it. The angel that stood by my side\ndeclared that God\u2019s supreme rulership and the sacredness of His law\nmust be revealed to those who persistently refused to render obe-\ndience to the King of kings. Those who choose to remain disloyal\nmust be visited in mercy with judgments, in order that, if possible,\nthey may be aroused to a realization of the sinfulness of their course.\nThroughout the following day I pondered the scenes that had\npassed before me and the instruction that had been given. During\nthe afternoon we journeyed to Glendale, near Los Angeles; and the\nfollowing night I was again instructed regarding the holiness and\nbinding claims of the Ten Commandments and the supremacy of [94]\nGod above all earthly rulers.\nI seemed to be in an assembly, setting before the people the\nrequirements of God\u2019s law. I read the scriptures regarding the in-\nstitution of the Sabbath in Eden at the close of the creation week,\nand regarding the giving of the law at Sinai; and then declared that\nthe Sabbath is to be observed \u201cfor a perpetual covenant\u201d as a sign\nbetween God and His people forever, that they may know that they\nare sanctified by the Lord, their Creator.\nThen I further dwelt upon the supreme rulership of God above\nall earthly rulers. His law is to be the standard of action. Men are\nforbidden to pervert their senses by intemperance or by yielding their\nminds to satanic influences, for this makes impossible the keeping\nof God\u2019s law. While the divine Ruler bears long with perversity, He\nis not deceived and will not always keep silence. His supremacy,\nHis authority as Ruler of the universe, must finally be acknowledged\nand the just claims of His law vindicated.\nMuch more instruction regarding the long-sufferance of God\nand the necessity of arousing transgressors to a realization of their\n84 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nperilous position in His sight was repeated to the people, as received\nfrom my instructor.\nOn April 18, two days after the scene of falling buildings had\npassed before me, I went to fill an appointment in the Carr Street\nChurch, Los Angeles. As we neared the church we heard the news-\nboys crying: \u201cSan Francisco destroyed by an earthquake!\u201d With\na heavy heart I read the first hastily printed news of the terrible\ndisaster.\nTwo weeks later, on our homeward journey, we passed through\nSan Francisco and, hiring a carriage, spent an hour and a half in\nviewing the destruction wrought in that great city. Buildings that[95]\nwere thought to be proof against disaster were lying in ruins. In\nsome instances buildings were partially sunken in the ground. The\ncity presented a most dreadful picture of the inefficiency of human\ningenuity to frame fireproof and earthquake-proof structures.\nThrough His prophet Zephaniah the Lord specifies the judgments\nthat He will bring upon evildoers:\n\u201cI will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the\nLord. I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the\nheaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the\nwicked; and I will cut off man from off the land, saith the Lord.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass in the day of the Lord\u2019s sacrifice, that\nI will punish the princes, and the king\u2019s children, and all such as are\nclothed with strange apparel. In the same day also will I punish all\nthose that leap on the threshold, which fill their masters\u2019 houses with\nviolence and deceit....\n\u201cAnd it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search\nJerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their\nlees: that say in their heart, The Lord will not do good, neither will\nHe do evil. Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their\nhouses a desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit\nthem; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.\n\u201cThe great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly,\neven the voice of the day of the Lord: the mighty man shall cry there\nbitterly. That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a\nday of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess,\na day of clouds and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and alarm[96]\nagainst the fenced cities, and against the high towers. And I will\nConditions in the Cities 85\nbring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because\nthey have sinned against the Lord: and their blood shall be poured\nout as dust, and their flesh as the dung. Neither their silver nor their\ngold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord\u2019s wrath;\nbut the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of His jealousy: for\nHe shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the\nland.\u201d Zephaniah 1:2, 3, 8-18.\nGod cannot forbear much longer. Already His judgments are\nbeginning to fall on some places, and soon His signal displeasure\nwill be felt in other places.\nThere will be a series of events revealing that God is master of\nthe situation. The truth will be proclaimed in clear, unmistakable\nlanguage. As a people we must prepare the way of the Lord under\nthe overruling guidance of the Holy Spirit. The gospel is to be given\nin its purity. The stream of living water is to deepen and widen in its\ncourse. In all fields, nigh and afar off, men will be called from the\nplow and from the more common commercial business vocations\nthat largely occupy the mind, and will be educated in connection\nwith men of experience. As they learn to labor effectively they will\nproclaim the truth with power. Through most wonderful workings\nof divine providence, mountains of difficulty will be removed and\ncast into the sea. The message that means so much to the dwellers\nupon the earth will be heard and understood. Men will know what\nis truth. Onward and still onward the work will advance until the\nwhole earth shall have been warned, and then shall the end come.\nChapter 11\u2014A Present-Day Work[97]\nMore and more, as the days go by, it is becoming apparent that\nGod\u2019s judgments are in the world. In fire and flood and earthquake\nHe is warning the inhabitants of this earth of His near approach. The\ntime is nearing when the great crisis in the history of the world will\nhave come, when every movement in the government of God will\nbe watched with intense interest and inexpressible apprehension. In\nquick succession the judgments of God will follow one another\u2014fire\nand flood and earthquake, with war and bloodshed.\nOh, that the people might know the time of their visitation! There\nare many who have not yet heard the testing truth for this time. There\nare many with whom the Spirit of God is striving. The time of God\u2019s\ndestructive judgments is the time of mercy for those who have had\nno opportunity to learn what is truth. Tenderly will the Lord look\nupon them. His heart of mercy is touched; His hand is still stretched\nout to save, while the door is closed to those who would not enter.\nThe mercy of God is shown in His long forbearance. He is\nholding back His judgments, waiting for the message of warning to\nbe sounded to all. Oh, if our people would feel as they should the\nresponsibility resting upon them to give the last message of mercy\nto the world, what a wonderful work would be done!\nBehold the cities, and their need of the gospel! The need of\nearnest laborers among the multitudes of the cities has been kept\nbefore me for more than twenty years. Who are carrying a burden\nfor the large cities? A few have felt the burden, but in comparison\nwith the great need and the many opportunities but little attention[98]\nhas been given to this work.\nIn the Cities of the East\nInstruction has been given me that the message should go again\nwith power in the cities in the Eastern States. In many of the large\ncities of the East the first and second angels\u2019 messages were pro-\n86\nPresent-Day Work 87\nclaimed during the 1844 movement. To us, as God\u2019s servants, has\nbeen entrusted the third angel\u2019s message, the binding-off message,\nthat is to prepare a people for the coming of the King. We are to\nmake every effort to give a knowledge of the truth to all who will\nhear, and there are many who will listen. All through the large cities\nGod has honest souls who are interested in what is truth.\nTime is short; the Lord desires that everything connected with\nHis cause shall be brought into order. He desires that the solemn\nmessage of warning and of invitation shall be proclaimed as widely\nas His messengers can carry it. Nothing that would hinder the\nadvance of the message is to be allowed to come into our plans.\n\u201cRepeat the message, repeat the message,\u201d were the words spoken\nto me over and over again. \u201cTell My people to repeat the message\nin the places where it was first preached, and where church after\nchurch took their position for the truth, the power of God witnessing\nto the message in a remarkable manner.\u201d\nFor years the pioneers of our work struggled against poverty and\nmanifold hardships in order to place the cause of present truth on\nvantage ground. With meager facilities, they labored untiringly, and\nthe Lord blessed their humble efforts. The message went with power\nin the East and extended westward until centers of influence had been [99]\nestablished in many places. The laborers of today may not have to\nendure all the hardships of those early days. The changed conditions,\nhowever, should not lead to any slackening of effort. Now, when\nthe Lord bids us proclaim the message once more with power in\nthe East, when He bids us enter the cities of the East and of the\nSouth and of the West and of the North, shall we not respond as one\nman and do His bidding? Shall we not plan to send our messengers\nall through these fields and support them liberally? Shall not the\nministers of God go into these crowded centers and there lift up their\nvoices in warning the multitudes? What are our conferences for, if\nnot for the carrying forward of this very work?\nA beginning has been made in proclaiming the third angel\u2019s\nmessage in the city of Washington and in other cities of the South\nand the East; but in order to meet the mind of the Lord, we shall have\nto plan for the carrying forward of a far-reaching and systematic\nwork. We must enter into this work with a perseverance that will\n88 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nnot allow of any slackening of our efforts until we shall see of the\nsalvation of God.\nIn Portland, Maine; in Boston and the towns round about; in New\nYork and the populous cities close by; in Philadelphia and Baltimore\nand Washington, the Lord desires us to proclaim the third angel\u2019s\nmessage with power. We cannot exercise this power ourselves, but\nwe can choose men of capability and urge them to go into these\navenues of opportunity and there proclaim the message in the power\nof the Holy Spirit. We must plan to place in these cities capable men\nwho can present the third angel\u2019s message in a manner so forcible\nthat it will strike home to the heart. Men who can do this work we[100]\ncannot afford to gather into one place to do a work that others might\ndo.\nAs these workers talk the truth and live the truth, and pray for\nthe advancement of the truth, God will move upon hearts. As they\nwork with all the strength that God grants them, and in humility of\nheart put their entire trust in Him, their labors will not be without\nfruit. Their determined efforts to bring souls to a knowledge of the\ntruth for this time will be seconded by holy angels, and many souls\nwill be saved.\nLiberality in Missionary Effort\nThe Southern States are to have the light of present truth. Do\nnot say: \u201cOur printing offices and our churches need more help. We\nneed all the means that we can get to carry on the work in hand.\u201d One\nafter another has shut the door to certain lines of missionary effort\nfor fear that this work would consume means which they desired\nfor other enterprises. My brethren, you need more of the Spirit of\nChrist. Let your standard be raised higher; then those who are newly\nconverted to the truth will understand that they have a work to do.\nIn this way the means for the carrying on of the work will be always\nincreasing.\nCan we expect the inhabitants of the cities to come to us and\nsay: \u201cIf you will come to us and preach, we will help you to do\nthus and so\u201d? What do they know of our message? Let us do our\npart in warning these people who are ready to perish unwarned and\nunsaved. The Lord desires us to let our light so shine before men\nPresent-Day Work 89\nthat His Holy Spirit can communicate the truth to the honest in heart\nwho are seeking after Him.\nAs we do this work we shall find that means will flow into our [101]\ntreasuries, and we shall have funds with which to carry on a still\nbroader and more far-reaching work. Souls who have wealth will\nbe brought into the truth and will give of their means to advance\nthe work of God. I have been instructed that there is much means\nin the cities that are unworked. God has interested people there.\nGo to them; teach them as Christ taught; give them the truth. They\nwill accept it. And as surely as honest souls will be converted, their\nmeans will be consecrated to the Lord\u2019s service, and we shall see an\nincrease of resources.\nOh, that we might see the needs of these cities as God sees them!\nAt such a time as this every hand is to be employed. The Lord is\ncoming; the end is near, yea, it hasteth greatly! In a little while we\nshall be unable to work with the freedom that we now enjoy. Terrible\nscenes are before us, and what we do we must do quickly.\nA Motive For Service\nRecently in the night season I was awakened from sleep and\ngiven a view of the sufferings of Christ for men. His sacrifice, the\nmockery and derision He received at the hands of wicked men, His\nagony in the Garden of Gethsemane, His betrayal and crucifixion\u2014\nall were vividly portrayed before me.\nI saw Christ in the midst of a large company of people. He was\nseeking to impress their minds with His teachings. But He was\ndespised and rejected by them. Men were heaping upon Him abuse\nand shame. My distress was very great as I looked upon the scene. I\npleaded with God: \u201cWhat is to be done with this congregation? Will\nnone give up their exalted opinions of self and seek the Lord as little [102]\nchildren? Will none break their hearts before God in repentance and\nconfession?\u201d\nThere was presented to me Christ\u2019s agony in the Garden of\nGethsemane, when the mysterious cup trembled in the Redeemer\u2019s\nhand. Father, if it be possible,\u201d He prayed, \u201clet this cup pass from\nMe: nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.\u201d Matthew 26:39.\nAs He pleaded with the Father, great drops of blood fell from His\n90 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nface to the ground. The elements of darkness were gathered about\nthe Saviour to discourage His soul.\nRising from the ground, Christ went to the place where He had\nleft His disciples, bidding them watch and pray with Him lest they\nbe overcome with temptation. He would see if they understood\nHis agony; He needed their human sympathy. But He found them\nsleeping. Three times He went thus to them, and each time they\nwere asleep.\nThree times the Saviour prayed: \u201cFather, if it be possible, let\nthis cup pass from Me.\u201d It was here that the destiny of a lost world\ntrembled in the balance. Should He refuse to drink the cup, the result\nwould be eternal ruin to the human race. But an angel from heaven\nstrengthened the Son of God to accept the cup and drink its bitter\nwoe.\nHow few there are who realize that all this was borne for them\nindividually! How few who say: \u201cIt was for me, that I might form a\ncharacter for the future immortal life.\u201d\nAs these things were presented to me so vividly, I thought, I\nshall never be able to present this subject before the people as it is;\u201d\nand I have given you only a faint representation of what was shown\nme. As I have thought of that cup trembling in the hands of Christ;\nas I have realized that He might have refused to drink, and left the[103]\nworld to perish in its sin, I have pledged that every energy of my life\nshould be devoted to the work of winning souls to Him.\nChrist came to the earth to suffer and die, that, through the exer-\ncise of faith in Him and the appropriation of His merits, we might\nbecome laborers together with God. It was the Saviour\u2019s purpose\nthat after He ascended to heaven to become man\u2019s intercessor, His\nfollowers should carry on the work that He had begun. Shall the hu-\nman agent show no special interest in giving the light of the gospel\nmessage to those who sit in darkness? There are some who are\nwilling to go to the ends of the earth in order to carry the light of\ntruth to men, but God demands that every soul who knows the truth\nshall seek to win others to the love of the truth. If we are not willing\nto make special sacrifices in order to save souls that are ready to\nperish, how can we be counted worthy to enter into the city of God?\nThere is an individual work to be done for each one of us. I\nknow there are many who are placing themselves in right relation to\nPresent-Day Work 91\nChrist, whose one thought is to bring the message of present truth\nbefore the people of the world. They stand continually ready to\noffer their services. But my heart aches when I see so many who are\nsatisfied with a cheap experience, an experience that costs them but\nlittle. Their lives say that for them Christ has died in vain.\nIf you do not feel that it is an honor to be a partaker of the\nsufferings of Christ; if you feel no burden of soul for those who are\nready to perish; if you are unwilling to sacrifice that you may save\nmeans for the work that is to be done, there will be no room for you\nin the kingdom of God. We need to be partakers with Christ of His [104]\nsufferings and self-denial at every step. We need to have the Spirit\nof God resting upon us, leading us to constant self-sacrifice.\nGet Ready\n\u201cBehold, I come quickly,\u201d Christ declares; \u201cand My reward\nis with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\u201d\nRevelation 22:12. The Lord at His coming will scrutinize every\ntalent; He will demand interest on the capital He has entrusted. By\nHis own humiliation and agony, by His life of toil and His death\nof shame, Christ has paid for the service of all who have taken His\nname and profess to be His servants. All are under deepest obligation\nto improve every capability for the work of winning souls to Him.\n\u201cYe are not your own,\u201d He says; \u201cfor ye are bought with a price;\u201d\ntherefore glorify God by a life of service that will win men and\nwomen from sin to righteousness. 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20. We are\nbought with the price of Christ\u2019s own life, bought that we may return\nto God His own in faithful service.\nWe have no time now to give our energies and talents to worldly\nenterprises. Shall we become absorbed in serving the world, serving\nourselves, and lose eternal life and the everlasting bliss of heaven?\nOh, we cannot afford to do this! Let every talent be employed\nin the work of God. Those who receive the truth are, by their\nefforts, to increase the number of men and women who shall be\nlaborers together with God. Souls are to be enlightened and taught\nto serve God intelligently; they are to be continually increasing in\nthe knowledge of righteousness.\n92 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nAll heaven is interested in the carrying forward of the work that\nChrist came to the world to do. Heavenly agencies are opening ways[105]\nfor the light of truth to shine to the dark places of the earth. Angels\nare waiting to communicate to those who will take hold of the work\nthat has been pointed out to us for years. Shall we not manifest an\ninterest to set in operation ways and means for the opening up of\ncity work? Many opportunities have been lost through neglecting\nto do this work at once, through failing to go forward in faith. The\nLord says: \u201cHad you exercised faith in the messages I have sent,\nthere would not be such a lack of workers and of means for their\nsupport.\u201d\nThe coming of Christ is near and hasteth greatly. The time in\nwhich to labor is short, and men and women are perishing. Said the\nangel: \u201cShould not the men who have had great light co-operate with\nHim who sent His Son to the world to give light and salvation to\nmen?\u201d Shall men who have received the knowledge of the truth line\nupon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little, show\nbut little appreciation of Him who came to the earth that His divine\npower might be the heritage of every believing soul? It was thus that\nthe divinity of Christ was to become effectual in the salvation of the\nrace, and the intercession of our great High Priest avail before the\nthrone of God. The plan was devised in heaven. Shall those who\nhave been bought with such a price fail of appreciating the great\nsalvation?\nThe Lord cannot commend the people who, professing godliness,\nprofessing to believe in the soon coming of Christ, leave the cities\nunwarned of the judgments that are soon to fall on the land. Those\nwho do this will be judged for their neglect. Christ gave His precious\nlife to save the souls that are perishing in their sins. Shall we refuse to\ndo the work assigned us, refuse to co-operate with God and heavenly\nagencies? There are thousands who are doing this, who are failing[106]\nof becoming one with Christ, failing of letting the great sacrifice\nof Christ shine forth in the life, in saving grace that reveals the\ntruth in works of righteousness. Yet this is the work given to men\nby the sacrifice of the Son of God. Knowing this, can we remain\nindifferent? I appeal to our brethren to wake up. The spiritual\nfaculties will grow weak and die if they are not exercised in winning\nPresent-Day Work 93\nsouls to Christ. What excuse can be offered for the neglect of the\ngreat, grand work that Christ gave His life to accomplish?\nWe cannot afford in the few days we have here on earth to spend\nour time in trifling and nothingness. We need to humble our souls\nbefore God, that every heart may drink in the truth, and let it work in\nthe life a reformation that will convince the world that this is indeed\nthe truth of God. Let the life be hid with Christ in God. Only when\nwe seek the Lord as little children, when we cease picking flaws\nin our brethren and sisters, and in those who are seeking to carry\nfaithfully the responsibilities of the work, and seek to get our own\nhearts right with God, can He use us to the glory of His name.\nWe all need to come into a self-sacrificing position before God\nif our work is to be accepted by Him. Let us remember that profes-\nsion is nothing unless we have the truth in the heart. We need the\nconverting power of God to take hold of us, that we may understand\nthe needs of a perishing world. The burden of my message to you is:\nGet ready, get ready to meet the Lord. Trim your lamps, and let the\nlight of truth shine forth into the byways and the hedges. There is a\nworld to be warned of the near approach of the end of all things.\nMy brethren and sisters, seek the Lord while He may be found.\nThere is a time coming when those who have wasted their time and [107]\nopportunities will wish they had sought Him. God has given you\nreasoning faculties. He wants you to keep in the line of reason and\nin the line of labor. He wants you to go forth to our churches to\nlabor earnestly for Him. He wants you to institute meetings for those\noutside the churches, that the people may learn the truths of this\nlast message of warning. There are places where you will be gladly\nreceived, where souls will thank you for coming to their help. May\nthe Lord help you to take hold of this work as you have never yet\ntaken hold of it.\nLet us begin to work for those who have not had the light. \u201cAll\npower is given unto Me in heaven and in earth,\u201d the Saviour declares,\n\u201cand, lo, I am with you alway.\u201d Matthew 28:18, 20. What we need\nis a living faith, faith to proclaim over the rent sepulcher of Joseph\nthat we have a living Saviour, one who will go before us and who\nwill work with us. God will do the work if we will furnish Him the\ninstruments. There needs to be among us a great deal more of prayer\nand much less of unbelief. We need to lift up the standard higher\n94 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nand still higher before the people. We need to remember that Christ\nis always at our right hand as we proclaim liberty to the captives\nand deal the bread of life to hungry souls. When we keep before our\nminds the urgency and importance of our work, the salvation of God\nwill be revealed in a remarkable manner.\nGod help us to put on the armor and to act as if we were in\nearnest, as if the souls of men and women were worth saving. Let\nus seek a new conversion. We need the presence of the Holy Spirit\nof God with us, that our hearts may be softened and that we may not\nbring a harsh spirit into the work. I pray that the Holy Spirit may\ntake full possession of our hearts. Let us act like children of God[108]\nwho are looking to Him for counsel, ready to work out His plans\nwherever presented. God will be glorified by such a people, and\nthose who witness our zeal will say: Amen and amen.\nAwake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beauti-\nful garments, O Jerusalem, the Holy City.... How beautiful upon\nthe mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that\npublisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth\nsalvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! Thy watchmen\nshall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for\nthey shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.\nBreak forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem:\nfor the Lord hath comforted His people, He hath redeemed Jerusalem.\nThe Lord hath made bare His holy arm in the eyes of all the nations;\nand all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.\u201d\nIsaiah 52:1-10.\nChapter 12\u2014Methods of Labor [109]\nIn connection with the proclamation of the message in large\ncities, there are many kinds of work to be done by laborers with\nvaried gifts. Some are to labor in one way, some in another. The\nLord desires that the cities shall be worked by the united efforts\nof laborers of different capabilities. All are to look to Jesus for\ndirection, not depending on man for wisdom, lest they be led astray.\nAs laborers together with God they should seek to be in harmony\nwith one another. There should be frequent councils and earnest,\nwholehearted co-operation. Yet all are to look to Jesus for wisdom,\nnot depending upon men alone for direction.\nThe Lord has given to some ministers the ability to gather and to\nhold large congregations. This calls for the exercise of tact and skill.\nIn the cities of today, where there is so much to attract and please,\nthe people can be interested by no ordinary efforts. Ministers of\nGod\u2019s appointment will find it necessary to put forth extraordinary\nefforts in order to arrest the attention of the multitudes. And when\nthey succeed in bringing together a large number of people they\nmust bear messages of a character so out of the usual order that the\npeople will be aroused and warned. They must make use of every\nmeans that can possibly be devised for causing the truth to stand\nout clearly and distinctly. The testing message for this time is to\nbe borne so plainly and decidedly as to startle the hearers and lead\nthem to desire to study the Scriptures.\nThose who do the work of the Lord in the cities must put forth\ncalm, steady, devoted effort for the education of the people. While [110]\nthey are to labor earnestly to interest the hearers and to hold this\ninterest, yet at the same time they must carefully guard against\nanything that borders on sensationalism. In this age of extravagance\nand outward show, when men think it is necessary to make a display\nin order to gain success, God\u2019s chosen messengers are to show the\nfallacy of spending means needlessly for effect. As they labor with\n95\n96 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nsimplicity, humility, and graceful dignity, avoiding everything of a\ntheatrical nature, their work will make a lasting impression for good.\nThere is a necessity, it is true, for expending money judiciously\nin advertising the meetings and in carrying forward the work solidly.\nYet the strength of every worker will be found to lie, not in these\noutward agencies, but in trustful dependence upon God, in earnest\nprayer to Him for help, in obedience to His word. Much more prayer,\nmuch more Christlikeness, much more conformity to God\u2019s will, is\nto be brought into the Lord\u2019s work. Outward show and extravagant\noutlay of means will not accomplish the work to be done.\nGod\u2019s work is to be carried forward with power. We need the\nbaptism of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand that God will\nadd to the ranks of His people men of ability and influence who\nare to act their part in warning the world. All in the world are not\nlawless and sinful. God has many thousands who have not bowed the\nknee to Baal. There are God-fearing men and women in the fallen\nchurches. If this were not so, we would not be given the message to\nbear: \u201cBabylon the great is fallen, is fallen.... Come out of her, My\npeople.\u201d Revelation 18:2-4. Many of the honest in heart are gasping\nfor a breath of life from heaven. They will recognize the gospel[111]\nwhen it is brought to them in the beauty and simplicity with which\nit is presented in God\u2019s word.\nThe Need of House-to-House Work\nOf equal importance with special public efforts is house-to-house\nwork in the homes of the people. In large cities there are certain\nclasses that cannot be reached by public meetings. These must be\nsearched out as the shepherd searches for his lost sheep. Diligent,\npersonal effort must be put forth in their behalf. When personal\nwork is neglected, many precious opportunities are lost, which, were\nthey improved, would advance the work decidedly.\nAs the result of the presentation of the truth in large congrega-\ntions, a spirit of inquiry is awakened, and it is especially important\nthat this interest be followed up by personal labor. Those who desire\nto investigate the truth need to be taught to study diligently the word\nof God. Someone must help them to build on the sure foundation.\nAt this critical time in their religious experience, how important it is\nMethods of Labor 97\nthat wisely directed Bible workers come to their help and open to\ntheir understanding the treasure house of God\u2019s word.\nThe City Mission a Training School\nA well-balanced work can be carried on best when a training\nschool for Bible workers is in progress. While the public meetings\nare being held, connected with this training school or city mission\nshould be experienced laborers of deep spiritual understanding who\ncan give the Bible workers daily instruction and who can also unite\nwholeheartedly in the general public effort being put forth. And as\nmen and women are converted to the truth, those standing at the [112]\nhead of the city mission should with much prayer show these new\nconverts how to experience the power of the truth in their lives. This\nunited effort on the part of all the workers would be as a nail driven\nin a sure place\nTeaching the Principles of Health Reform\nAs a people we have been given the work of making known\nthe principles of health reform. There are some who think that the\nquestion of diet is not of sufficient importance to be included in\ntheir evangelistic work. But such make a great mistake. God\u2019s word\ndeclares: Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do,\ndo all to the glory of God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:31. The subject of\ntemperance, in all its bearings, has an important place in the work\nof salvation.\nIn connection with our city missions there should be suitable\nrooms where those in whom an interest has been awakened can be\ngathered for instruction. This necessary work is not to be carried on\nin such a meager way that an unfavorable impression will be made\non the minds of the people. All that is done should bear favorable\nwitness to the Author of truth and should properly represent the\nsacredness and importance of the truths of the third angel\u2019s message.\nCooking schools are to be held. The people are to be taught\nhow to prepare wholesome food. They are to be shown the need\nof discarding unhealthful foods. But we should never advocate a\nstarvation diet. It is possible to have a wholesome, nutritious diet\n98 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwithout the use of tea, coffee, and flesh food. The work of teaching\nthe people how to prepare a dietary that is at once wholesome and\nappetizing is of the utmost importance.\nThe work of health reform is the Lord\u2019s means for lessening[113]\nsuffering in our world and for purifying His church. Teach the\npeople that they can act as God\u2019s helping hand by co-operating\nwith the Master Worker in restoring physical and spiritual health.\nThis work bears the signature of heaven and will open doors for the\nentrance of other precious truths. There is room for all to labor who\nwill take hold of this work intelligently.\nKeep the work of health reform to the front is the message I\nam instructed to bear. Show so plainly its value that a widespread\nneed for it will be felt. Abstinence from all hurtful food and drink\nis the fruit of true religion. He who is thoroughly converted will\nabandon every injurious habit and appetite. By total abstinence he\nwill overcome his desire for health-destroying indulgences.\nI am instructed to say to health reform educators: Go forward.\nThe world needs every jot of the influence you can exert to press back\nthe tide of moral woe. Let those who teach the third angel\u2019s message\nstand true to their colors. \u201cI beseech you therefore, brethren, by the\nmercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,\nacceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not\nconformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of\nyour mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and\nperfect, will of God.\u201d Romans 12:1, 2. May the Lord arm those who\nlabor in word and doctrine, with the clearest messages of truth. If\nHis workers will give these messages with simplicity, assurance, and\nall authority, the Lord will work with them.\nThe Wealthy Classes Not to be Passed By\nThe servants of Christ should labor faithfully for the rich men\nin our cities, as well as for the poor and lowly. There are many[114]\nwealthy men who are susceptible to the influences and impressions\nof the gospel message, and who, when the Bible, and the Bible\nalone, is presented to them as the expositor of Christian faith and\npractice, will be moved by the Spirit of God to open doors for the\nadvancement of the gospel. They will reveal a living faith in the\nMethods of Labor 99\nword of God and will use their entrusted means to prepare the way\nof the Lord, to make straight in the desert a highway for our God.\nFor years the perplexing question has been before us: How can\nwe raise funds adequate for the support of the missions which the\nLord has gone before us to open? We read the plain commands of\nthe gospel; and the missions, in both home and foreign fields, present\ntheir necessities. The indications, yea, the positive revelations of\nProvidence, unite in urging us to do quickly the work that is waiting\nto be done. The Lord desires that moneyed men shall be converted\nand act as His helping hand in reaching others. He desires that those\nwho can help in the work of reform and restoration shall see the\nprecious light of truth and be transformed in character and led to use\ntheir entrusted capital in His service. He would have them invest the\nmeans He has lent them, in doing good, in opening the way for the\ngospel to be preached to all classes nigh and afar off.\nWill not heaven be appreciated by the worldly wise men? Oh,\nyes; there they will find rest and peace and repose from all trifling,\nall ambition, all self-serving. Urge them to seek for the peace and\nhappiness and joy that Christ is longing to bestow upon them. Urge\nthem to give their attention to securing the richest gift that can be\ngiven to mortal man\u2014the robe of Christ\u2019s righteousness. Christ\noffers them a life that measures with the life of God, and a far more [115]\nexceeding and eternal weight of glory. If they accept Christ they will\nhave the highest honor, honor which the world can neither give nor\ntake away. They will find that in the keeping of the commandments\nof God there is great reward.\nThe compassionate Redeemer bids His servants give to rich and\npoor the call to the supper. Go out into the highways and the hedges,\nand by your persevering, determined efforts, compel them to come\nin. Let ministers of the gospel take hold of these worldly moneyed\nmen and bring them to the banquet of truth that Christ has prepared\nfor them. He who gave His precious life for them says: \u201cBring them\nin, and seat them at My table, and I will serve them.\u201d\nMinisters of Christ, link yourselves up with this class. Pass them\nnot by as hopeless. Work with all the persuasion possible, and as the\nfruit of your faithful efforts you will see in the kingdom of heaven\nmen and women who will be crowned as overcomers to sing the\ntriumphant song of the conqueror. \u201cThey shall walk with Me in\n100 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwhite,\u201d says the First and the Last; \u201cfor they are worthy.\u201d Revelation\n3:4.\nAltogether too little effort has been put forth for men in respon-\nsible places in the world. Many of them possess superior qualifi-\ncations; they have means and influence. These are precious gifts,\nentrusted to them by the Lord to be increased and used for the good\nof others.\nSeek to save men of wealth. Entreat them to return to the Lord\nthe treasures He has lent them in trust, that in New York and other\ngreat cities there may be established centers of influence from which\nBible truth in its simplicity shall go forth to the people. Persuade\nmen to lay up their treasures beside the throne of God by returning[116]\nto the Lord their substance, enabling His workers to do good and to\nadvance His glory.\nPlans for Enlarging Our Laboring Forces\nThe strength of an army is measured largely by the efficiency of\nthe men in the ranks. A wise general instructs his officers to train\nevery soldier for active service. He seeks to develop the highest\nefficiency on the part of all. If he were to depend on his officers\nalone he could never expect to conduct a successful campaign. He\ncounts on loyal and untiring service from every man in his army.\nThe responsibility rests largely upon the men in the ranks.\nAnd so it is in the army of Prince Immanuel. Our General, who\nhas never lost a battle, expects willing, faithful service from everyone\nwho has enlisted under His banner. In the closing controversy now\nwaging between the forces for good and the hosts of evil He expects\nall, laymen as well as ministers, to take part. All who have enlisted\nas His soldiers are to render faithful service as minutemen, with a\nkeen sense of the responsibility resting upon them individually.\nThose who have the spiritual oversight of the church should\ndevise ways and means by which an opportunity may be given\nto every member of the church to act some part in God\u2019s work.\nToo often in the past this has not been done. Plans have not been\nclearly laid and fully carried out whereby the talents of all might\nbe employed in active service. There are but few who realize how\nmuch has been lost because of this.\nMethods of Labor 101\nThe leaders in God\u2019s cause, as wise generals, are to lay plans for\nadvance moves all along the line. In their planning they are to give\nspecial study to the work that can be done by the laity for their friends [117]\nand neighbors. The work of God in this earth can never be finished\nuntil the men and women comprising our church membership rally\nto the work and unite their efforts with those of ministers and church\nofficers.\nThe salvation of sinners requires earnest, personal labor. We are\nto bear to them the word of life, not to wait for them to come to us.\nOh, that I could speak words to men and women that would arouse\nthem to diligent action! The moments now granted to us are few.\nWe are standing upon the very borders of the eternal world. We have\nno time to lose. Every moment is golden and altogether too precious\nto be devoted merely to self-serving. Who will seek God earnestly\nand from Him draw strength and grace to be His faithful workers in\nthe missionary field?\nDevelopment of Talent in the Churches\nIn every church there is talent, which, with the right kind of\nlabor, might be developed to become a great help in this work. That\nwhich is needed now for the upbuilding of our churches is the nice\nwork of wise laborers to discern and develop talent in the church\u2014\ntalent that can be educated for the Master\u2019s use. There should be a\nwell-organized plan for the employment of workers to go into all our\nchurches, large and small, to instruct the members how to labor for\nthe upbuilding of the church and also for unbelievers. It is training,\neducation, that is needed. Those who labor in visiting the churches\nshould give the brethren and sisters instruction in practical methods\nof doing missionary work.\nAll the preaching in the world will not make men feel deeply\nthe need of perishing souls around them. Nothing will so arouse in [118]\nmen and women a self-sacrificing zeal as to send them forth into\nnew fields to work for those in darkness. Prepare workers to go out\ninto the highways and hedges. We need wise nurserymen who will\ntransplant trees to different localities and give them advantages, that\nthey may grow. It is the positive duty of God\u2019s people to go into\nthe regions beyond. Let forces be set at work to clear new ground,\n102 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nto establish new centers of influence wherever an opening can be\nfound. Rally workers who possess true missionary zeal, and let them\ngo forth to diffuse light and knowledge far and near. Let them take\nthe living principles of health reform into the communities that to a\nlarge degree are ignorant of these principles.\nMen in humble walks of life are to be encouraged to take up the\nwork of God. As they labor they will gain a precious experience.\nThere is a dearth of laborers, and we have not one to spare. Instead\nof discouraging those who are trying to serve the Master, we should\nencourage many more laborers to enter the field.\nJoyous Service\nAll who commune with God will find abundance of work to do\nfor Him. Those who go forth in the spirit of the Master, seeking to\nreach souls with the truth, will not find the work of drawing souls\nto Christ a dull, uninteresting drudgery. They are charged with a\nwork as God\u2019s husbandmen, and they will become more and more\nvitalized as they give themselves to the service of God. It is a joyous\nwork to open the Scriptures to others.\nYoung men and women should be educated to become workers\nin their own neighborhoods and in other places. Let all set their\nhearts and minds to become intelligent in regard to the work for[119]\nthis time, qualifying themselves to do that for which they are best\nadapted.\nMany young men who have had the right kind of education\nat home are to be trained for service and encouraged to lift the\nstandard of truth in new places by well-planned and faithful work.\nBy associating with our ministers and experienced workers in city\nwork, they will gain the best kind of training. Acting under divine\nguidance and sustained by the prayers of their more experienced\nfellow workers, they may do a good and blessed work. As they unite\ntheir labors with those of the older workers, using their youthful\nenergies to the very best account, they will have the companionship\nof heavenly angels; and as workers together with God, it is their\nprivilege to sing and pray and believe, and work with courage and\nfreedom. The confidence and trust that the presence of heavenly\nMethods of Labor 103\nagencies will bring to them and to their fellow workers will lead to\nprayer and praise and the simplicity of true faith.\nThere should be no delay in this well-planned effort to educate\nthe church members. Persons should be chosen to labor in the large\ncities who are fully consecrated and who understand the sacredness\nand importance of the work. Do not send those who are not qualified\nin these respects. Men are needed who will push the triumphs of\nthe cross, who will persevere under discouragements and privations,\nwho will have the zeal and resolution and faith that are indispensable\nto the missionary field. And to those who do not engage personally\nin the work I would say: Do not hinder those who are willing to\nwork, but give them encouragement and support.\nAll this work of training should be accompanied with earnest\nseeking of the Lord for His Holy Spirit. Let this be urged home upon [120]\nthose who are willing to give themselves to the Master\u2019s service.\nOur conduct is watched by the world. Every act is scrutinized and\ncommented upon. There must be diligent cultivation of the Christian\ngraces, that those who profess the truth may be able to teach it to\nothers as it is in Jesus, that they themselves may be ensamples, and\nthat our enemies may be able to say no evil of them truthfully. God\ncalls for greater piety, for holiness of life and purity of conduct,\nin accordance with the elevating, sanctifying principles that we\nprofess. The lives of the workers for Christ should be such that\nunbelievers, seeing their godly walk and circumspect conversation,\nmay be charmed by the faith that produces such results.\nPersonal Effort in Connection With Camp Meetings\nThe work at our camp meetings should be conducted, not ac-\ncording to man\u2019s devising, but after the manner of Christ\u2019s working.\nThe church members should be drawn out to labor. Angels of God\nwill direct in the opening of fields nigh and afar off, that the work of\nwarning the world may be quickly accomplished. God calls upon\nbelievers to obtain an experience in missionary work by branching\nout into new territory and working intelligently for the people in the\nbyways. To those who will do this, openings for labor will come.\nIn following up the interests after a camp meeting, helpers are\nneeded in various lines, and these occasions should be as training\n104 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nschools for workers. Let young men work in connection with ex-\nperienced laborers who will pray with them and patiently instruct\nthem. Consecrated women should engage in Bible work from house\nto house. Some of the workers should act as colporteurs, selling our[121]\nliterature and giving judiciously to those who cannot buy.\nThose who are truly converted must become more and more\nintelligent in their understanding of the Scriptures, that they may\nbe able to speak words of light and salvation to those who are in\ndarkness and perishing in their sins. As workers together with Him\nwe are to expect special blessings and definite results as we strive\nto save souls from the snares of Satan that they may become the\nchildren of light.\nTourist Centers and Centers of Commerce\nThose who in response to the call of the hour have entered the\nservice of the Master Workman may well study His methods of\nlabor. During His earthly ministry the Saviour took advantage of the\nopportunities to be found along the great thoroughfares of travel. It\nwas at Capernaum that Jesus dwelt at the intervals of His journeys to\nand fro, and it came to be known as \u201cHis own city.\u201d This city was well\nadapted to be the center of the Saviour\u2019s work. Being on the highway\nfrom Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt, and to the Mediterranean\nSea, it was a great thoroughfare of travel. People from many lands\npassed through the city or tarried for rest on their journeyings to\nand fro. Here Jesus could meet all nations and all ranks, the rich\nand great, as well as the poor and lowly; and His lessons would be\ncarried to other countries and into many households. Investigation\nof the prophecies would thus be excited; attention would be directed\nto the Saviour, and His mission would be brought before the world.\nIn these days of travel the opportunities for coming in contact[122]\nwith men and women of all classes and of many nationalities are\nmuch greater than in the days of Israel. The thoroughfares of travel\nhave multiplied a thousandfold. God has wonderfully prepared the\nway. The agency of the printing press, with its manifold facilities,\nis at our command. Bibles, and publications in many languages,\nsetting forth the truth for this time, are at our hand and can be swiftly\ncarried to every part of the world.\nMethods of Labor 105\nChristians who are living in the great centers of commerce and\ntravel have special opportunities. Believers in these cities can work\nfor God in the neighborhood of their homes.\nIn the world-renowned health resorts and centers of tourist traffic,\ncrowded with many thousands of seekers after health and pleasure,\nthere should be stationed ministers and canvassers capable of arrest-\ning the attention of the multitudes. Let these workers watch their\nchance for presenting the message for this time, and hold meetings\nas they have opportunity. Let them be quick to seize opportunities to\nspeak to the people. Accompanied by the power of the Holy Spirit,\nlet them meet the people with the message borne by John the Baptist:\n\u201cRepent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.\u201d Matthew 3:2.\nThe word of God is to be presented with clearness and power, that\nthose who have ears to hear may hear the truth. Thus the gospel of\npresent truth will be placed in the way of those who know it not, and\nit will be accepted by not a few and carried by them to their own\nhomes in all parts of the world.\nWith Unflagging Zeal\nWe are to give the last warning of God to men, and what should\nbe our earnestness in studying the Bible and our zeal in spreading [123]\nthe light! Let every soul who has received the divine illumination\nseek to impart it. Let the workers go from house to house, opening\nthe Bible to the people, circulating the publications, telling others of\nthe light that has blessed their own souls. Let literature be distributed\njudiciously, on the trains, in the street, on the great ships that ply the\nsea, and through the mails.\nA great work is to be done, and those who know the truth should\nmake mighty intercession for help. The love of Christ must fill\ntheir own hearts. The Spirit of Christ must be poured out upon\nthem, and they must be making ready to stand in the judgment.\nAs they consecrate themselves to God, a convincing power will\nattend their efforts to present the truth to others. We must no longer\nsleep on Satan\u2019s enchanted ground, but call into requisition all our\nresources, availing ourselves of every facility with which Providence\nhas furnished us. The last warning is to be proclaimed before \u201cmany\npeoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings,\u201d and the promise is\n106 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\ngiven, \u201cLo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\u201d\nRevelation 10:11; Matthew 28:20.\nI am instructed to point our ministers to the unworked cities\nand to urge them by every possible means to open the way for the\npresentation of the truth. In some of the cities where the message\nof the second coming of the Lord was first given, we are compelled\nto take up the work as if it were a new field. How much longer will\nthese barren fields, these unworked cities, be passed by? Without\ndelay the sowing of the seed should begin in many, many places.\nThe Lord demands that in His servants shall be found a spirit\nthat is quick to feel the value of souls, quick to discern the duties\nto be done, quick to respond to the obligations that the Lord lays[124]\nupon them. There must be a devotion that will regard no earthly\ninterest of sufficient value to take the place of the work to be done\nin winning souls to a knowledge of the truth.\nMinisters, preach the truths that will lead to personal labor for\nthose who are out of Christ. Encourage personal effort in every\npossible way. Remember that a minister\u2019s work does not consist\nmerely in preaching. He is to visit families in their homes, to pray\nwith them, and to open to them the Scriptures. He who does faithful\nwork outside of the pulpit will accomplish tenfold more than he who\nconfines his labors to the desk. Let our ministers carry their load\nof responsibility with fear and trembling, looking to the Lord for\nwisdom and asking constantly for His grace. Let them make Jesus\ntheir pattern, diligently studying His life and bringing into the daily\npractice the principles that actuated Him in His service while upon\nthe earth.\n* * * * *\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest.\u201d This is a prescription for the healing of all mental\nand physical and spiritual ills. It is Christ\u2019s gift to those who seek\nHim in sincerity and in truth. He is the Mighty Healer. Then comes\nanother invitation: \u201cTake My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I\nam meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\nFor My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Matthew 11:28-30.\nWearing Christ\u2019s yoke and learning of Him the lesson of meekness\nMethods of Labor 107\nand lowliness, we find rest in faith, and confidence and trust. We\nfind that Christ\u2019s yoke is easy and His burden light.\nChapter 13\u2014An Appeal to Laymen[125]\nWhen a special effort is put forth by laborers of experience in a\ncommunity where our own people live, there rests upon the believers\nin that field a most solemn obligation to do all in their power to\nopen the way for the Lord to work. They should search their hearts\nprayerfully, and clear the King\u2019s highway by putting away every sin\nthat would hinder them from co-operating with God and with their\nbrethren.\nThis has not always been fully understood. Satan has often\nbrought in a spirit that has made it impossible for church members\nto discern opportunities for service. Believers have not infrequently\nallowed the enemy to work through them at the very time when they\nshould have been wholly consecrated to God and to the advancement\nof His work. Unconsciously they have wandered far from the way\nof righteousness. Cherishing a spirit of criticism and faultfinding,\nof pharisaical piety and pride, they have grieved away the Spirit of\nGod and have greatly retarded the work of God\u2019s messengers.\nThis evil has been pointed out many times and in many places.\nSometimes those who have indulged in a censorious, condemnatory\nspirit have repented and been converted. Then God has been able to\nuse them to His name\u2019s honor and glory.\nWe are living in a special period of this earth\u2019s history. A great\nwork must be done in a very short time, and every Christian is to\nact a part in sustaining this work. God is calling for men who will\nconsecrate themselves to the work of soulsaving. When we begin to\ncomprehend what a sacrifice Christ made in order to save a perishing\nworld, there will be seen a mighty wrestling to save souls. Oh, that[126]\nall our churches might see and realize the infinite sacrifice of Christ!\nA Reformatory Movement\nIn visions of the night, representations passed before me of a\ngreat reformatory movement among God\u2019s people. Many were prais-\n108\nAppeal to Laymen 109\ning God. The sick were healed, and other miracles were wrought. A\nspirit of intercession was seen, even as was manifested before the\ngreat Day of Pentecost. Hundreds and thousands were seen visiting\nfamilies and opening before them the word of God. Hearts were\nconvicted by the power of the Holy Spirit, and a spirit of genuine\nconversion was manifest. On every side doors were thrown open\nto the proclamation of the truth. The world seemed to be lightened\nwith the heavenly influence. Great blessings were received by the\ntrue and humble people of God. I heard voices of thanksgiving and\npraise, and there seemed to be a reformation such as we witnessed\nin 1844.\nYet some refused to be converted. They were not willing to\nwalk in God\u2019s way, and when, in order that the work of God might\nbe advanced, calls were made for freewill offerings, some clung\nselfishly to their earthly possessions. These covetous ones became\nseparated from the company of believers.\nLaboring While Probation Lingers\nThe judgments of God are in the earth, and, under the influence\nof the Holy Spirit, we must give the message of warning that He has\nentrusted to us. We must give this message quickly, line upon line,\nprecept upon precept. Men will soon be forced to great decisions,\nand it is our duty to see that they are given an opportunity to under- [127]\nstand the truth, that they may take their stand intelligently on the\nright side. The Lord calls upon His people to labor\u2014labor earnestly\nand wisely\u2014while probation lingers.\nThe Importance of Personal Labor\nAmong the members of our churches there should be more house-\nto-house labor in giving Bible readings and distributing literature.\nA Christian character can be symmetrically and completely formed\nonly when the human agent regards it as a privilege to work disinter-\nestedly in the proclamation of the truth and to sustain the cause of\nGod with means. We must sow beside all waters, keeping our souls\nin the love of God, working while it is day, and using the means the\nLord has given us to do whatever duty comes next. Whatever our\n110 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nhands find to do, we are to do it with faithfulness; whatever sacrifice\nwe are called upon to make, we are to make it cheerfully. As we sow\nbeside all waters we shall realize that \u201che which soweth bountifully\nshall reap also bountifully.\u201d 2 Corinthians 9:6.\nChrist\u2019s example must be followed by those who claim to be\nHis children. Relieve the physical necessities of your fellow men,\nand their gratitude will break down the barriers and enable you to\nreach their hearts. Consider this matter earnestly. As churches you\nhave had opportunity to work as laborers together with God. Had\nyou obeyed the word of God, had you entered upon this work, you\nwould have been blessed and encouraged, and would have obtained\na rich experience. You would have found yourselves, as the human\nagencies of God, earnestly advocating a scheme of saving, of restora-\ntion, of salvation. This scheme would not be fixed, but progressive,[128]\nmoving on from grace to grace and from strength to strength.\nThe Lord has presented before me the work that is to be done\nin our cities. The believers in these cities are to work for God in\nthe neighborhood of their homes. They are to labor quietly and in\nhumility, carrying with them wherever they go the atmosphere of\nheaven. If they keep self out of sight, pointing always to Christ, the\npower of their influence will be felt.\nIt is not the Lord\u2019s purpose that ministers should be left to do\nthe greatest part of the work of sowing the seeds of truth. Men who\nare not called to the ministry are to labor for their Master according\nto their several ability. As a worker gives himself unreservedly to\nthe service of the Lord, he gains an experience that enables him to\nwork more and more successfully for the Master. The influence that\ndrew him to Christ helps him to draw others to Christ. The work of\na public speaker may never be laid upon him, but he is nonetheless\na minister for God, and his work testifies that he is born of God.\nWomen as well as men can engage in the work of hiding the truth\nwhere it can work out and be made manifest. They can take their\nplace in the work at this crisis, and the Lord will work through them.\nIf they are imbued with a sense of their duty, and labor under the\ninfluence of the Spirit of God, they will have just the self-possession\nrequired for this time. The Saviour will reflect upon these self-\nsacrificing women the light of His countenance, and this will give\nthem a power that will exceed that of men. They can do in families\nAppeal to Laymen 111\na work that men cannot do, a work that reaches the inner life. They\ncan come close to the hearts of those whom men cannot reach. Their\nwork is needed. Discreet and humble women can do a good work in [129]\nexplaining the truth to the people in their homes. The word of God\nthus explained will do its leavening work, and through its influence\nwhole families will be converted.\nMy brethren and sisters, study your plans; grasp every oppor-\ntunity of speaking to your neighbors and associates or of reading\nsomething to them from books that contain present truth. Show that\nyou regard as of first importance the salvation of the souls for whom\nChrist has made so great a sacrifice.\nIn working for perishing souls, you have the companionship of\nangels. Thousands upon thousands, and ten thousand times ten thou-\nsand angels are waiting to cooperate with members of our churches\nin communicating the light that God has generously given, that a\npeople may be prepared for the coming of Christ. \u201cNow is the ac-\ncepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.\u201d Let every family\nseek the Lord in earnest prayer for help to do the work of God.\nDo not pass by the little things, and look for a large work. You\nmight do successfully the small work, but fail utterly in attempting a\nlarge work and fall into discouragement. Take hold wherever you\nsee that there is work to be done. Whether you are rich or poor,\ngreat or humble, God calls you into active service for Him. It will be\nby doing with your might what your hands find to do that you will\ndevelop talent and aptitude for the work. And it is by neglecting your\ndaily opportunities that you become fruitless and withered. This is\nwhy there are so many fruitless trees in the garden of the Lord.\nIn the home circle, at your neighbor\u2019s fireside, at the bedside of\nthe sick, in a quiet way you may read the Scriptures and speak a\nword for Jesus and the truth. Precious seed may thus be sown that [130]\nwill spring up and bring forth fruit after many days.\nThere is missionary work to be done in many unpromising places.\nThe missionary spirit needs to take hold of our souls, inspiring us to\nreach classes for whom we had not planned to labor and in ways and\nplaces that we had no idea of working. The Lord has His plan for\nthe sowing of the gospel seed. In sowing according to His will, we\nshall so multiply the seed that His word may reach thousands who\nhave never heard the truth.\n112 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nOpportunities are opening on every side. Press into every provi-\ndential opening. Eyes need to be anointed with the heavenly eyesalve\nto see and sense their opportunities. God calls now for wide-awake\nmissionaries. There are ways that will be presented before us. We\nare to see and understand these providential openings.\nGod\u2019s messengers are commissioned to take up the very work\nthat Christ did while on this earth. They are to give themselves\nto every line of ministry that He carried on. With earnestness and\nsincerity they are to tell men of the unsearchable riches and the\nimmortal treasure of heaven. They are to be filled with the Holy\nSpirit. They are to repeat Heaven\u2019s offers of peace and pardon. They\nare to point to the gates of the city of God, saying: \u201cBlessed are they\nthat do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of\nlife, and may enter in through the gates into the city.\u201d Revelation\n22:14.\nCherishing a Spirit of Self-Denial\nEvery church member should cherish a spirit of sacrifice. In\nevery home there should be taught lessons of self-denial. Fathers\nand mothers, teach your children to economize. Encourage them to[131]\nsave their pennies for missionary work. Christ is our example. For\nour sakes He became poor, that we through His poverty might be\nmade rich. He taught that all should come together in love and unity,\nto work as He worked, to sacrifice as He sacrificed, to love as the\nchildren of God.\nMy brethren and sisters, you must be willing to be converted\nyourselves in order to practice the self-denial of Christ. Dress plainly\nbut neatly. Spend as little as possible upon yourselves. Keep in your\nhomes a self-denial box into which you can put the money saved by\nlittle acts of self-denial. Day by day gain a clearer understanding\nof the word of God, and improve every opportunity to impart the\nknowledge you have gained. Do not become weary in well-doing,\nfor God is constantly imparting to you the great blessing of His Gift\nto the world. Co-operate with the Lord Jesus, and He will teach you\nthe priceless lessons of His love. Time is short; in due season when\ntime shall be no longer, you will receive your reward.\nAppeal to Laymen 113\nTo those who love God sincerely and have means, I am bidden\nto say: Now is the time for you to invest your means in sustaining\nthe work of the Lord. Now is the time to uphold the hands of the\nministers in their self-denying efforts to save perishing souls. When\nyou meet in the heavenly courts the souls you have helped to save,\nwill you not have a glorious reward?\nLet none withhold their mites, and let those who have much\nrejoice that they can lay up in heaven a treasure that faileth not. The\nmoney that we refuse to invest in the work of the Lord, will perish.\nOn it no interest will accumulate in the bank of heaven.\nIn the following words the apostle Paul describes those who [132]\nwithhold from God His own: \u201cThey that will be rich fall into temp-\ntation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which\ndrown men in destruction and perdition. For the love of money is\nthe root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred\nfrom the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\u201d\n1 Timothy 6:9, 10.\nIt means much to sow beside all waters. It means a continual\nimparting of gifts and offerings. God will furnish facilities so that\nthe faithful steward of His entrusted means shall be supplied with\na sufficiency in all things, and be enabled to abound to every good\nwork. \u201cAs it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the\npoor: his righteousness remaineth forever. Now he that ministereth\nseed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply\nyour seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness.\u201d 2\nCorinthians 9:9, 10. The seed sown with full, liberal hand is taken\ncharge of by the Lord. He who ministers seed to the sower gives His\nworker that which enables him to co-operate with the Giver of the\nseed.\nThe Lord now calls upon Seventh-day Adventists in every lo-\ncality to consecrate themselves to Him and to do their very best,\naccording to their circumstances, to assist in His work. By their\nliberality in making gifts and offerings, He desires them to reveal\ntheir appreciation of His blessings and their gratitude for His mercy.\nMy dear brethren and sisters, all the money we have is the Lord\u2019s.\nI now appeal to you in the name of the Lord to unite in carrying to\nsuccessful completion the enterprises that have been undertaken in\nthe counsels of God. Let not the work of establishing memorials for\n114 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nGod in many places be made difficult and burdensome because the[133]\nnecessary means is withheld. Let not those who are struggling to\nbuild up important enterprises, great and small, become disheartened\nbecause we are slow to unite in placing these enterprises in a position\nto do efficient service. Let all our people arise and see what they can\ndo. Let them show that there is unity and strength among Seventh-\nday Adventists.\nConditions of Acceptable Service\nAs a people we must come into a sacred nearness to God. We\nneed the light of heaven to shine into our hearts and into the chambers\nof our mind; we need the wisdom that God alone can give, if we\ncarry the message to these cities with success. Let our churches\neverywhere come into line. Let none who have pledged themselves\nby baptism to live for the service and glory of God take back their\npledge. There is a world to be saved; let this thought urge us on to\ngreater sacrifices and more earnest labor for those who are out of\nthe way.\nWhen you follow out the principles of the word of God, your\ninfluence will be of value to any church, any organization. You\nare to come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord\nagainst the mighty. All frivolous words, all lightness and trifling, are\nenticements of the enemy to deprive you of spiritual strength. Brace\nyourselves against this evil, in the name of the God of Israel. If you\nwill humble yourselves before God, He will give you a message\nfor those in the highways and the hedges, and for those in foreign\ncountries who need your help. Trim your lamps, and keep them\nburning, that wherever you may go you may reveal in speech and\naction precious rays of light.\nIf we will give ourselves for service to the Lord, He will instruct[134]\nus what to do. If we will come into close relation with God, He\nwill work with us. Let us not become so absorbed in self and self-\ninterests that we shall forget those who are climbing the ladder of\nChristian experience and who need our help. We must stand ready\nto use our God-given capabilities in the work of the Lord, ready to\nspeak words in season and out of season\u2014words that will help and\nbless.\nAppeal to Laymen 115\nMy brethren and sisters, do we take into consideration the needs\nof the large cities of the East? Do we not know that they must be\nwarned of Christ\u2019s near approach? The work we have to do is a\nwonderfully great work. There is a world to be saved; there are souls\nto be labored for in the cities of the East, in the states where the\nmessage of the coming of our Lord was first preached. Who will give\nthemselves to do this line of missionary work? There are hundreds\nof our people who ought to be out in the field who are doing little or\nnothing for the advancement of the message. Those who have had\nevery advantage of knowing the truth, who have received instruction\nline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little,\nhave a great responsibility resting upon them in these souls who\nhave never heard the last gospel message.\nIf in this opportune time the members of the churches will come\nhumbly before God, putting out of their hearts all that is wrong and\nconsulting Him at every step, He will manifest Himself to them and\nwill give them courage in Him. And as the church members do their\npart faithfully, the Lord will lead and guide His chosen ministers,\nand strengthen them for their important work. In much prayer let us\nall unite in holding up their hands and in drawing bright beams from [135]\nthe heavenly sanctuary.\nThe end is near, stealing upon us stealthily, imperceptibly, like\nthe noiseless approach of a thief in the night. May the Lord grant\nthat we shall no longer sleep as do others, but that we shall watch\nand be sober. The truth is soon to triumph gloriously, and all who\nnow choose to be laborers together with God will triumph with it.\nThe time is short; the night soon cometh when no man can work.\nLet those who are rejoicing in the light of present truth now make\nhaste to impart the truth to others. The Lord is inquiring: \u201cWhom\nshall I send?\u201d Those who wish to sacrifice for the truth\u2019s sake are\nnow to respond: \u201cHere am I; send me.\u201d Isaiah 6:8.\n* * * * *\nLet those who bear responsibilities remember that it is the Holy\nSpirit who is to do the fashioning. It is the Lord who controls. We\nare not to try to mold, according to our own ideas, those for whom\nwe work, but to let Christ do the molding. He follows no human\n116 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\npattern. He works according to His own mind and Spirit. It is man\u2019s\nwork to reveal to the world that which Christ has placed in his heart;\nthrough His grace man becomes a partaker of the divine nature,\nhaving escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. The\nhigher powers of the one who receives Christ are strengthened and\nennobled, and he receives a fitness for God\u2019s service.\nMany of the world\u2019s learned men have received so high an edu-\ncation that they cannot touch the common people. Their knowledge\nis intricate. It soars high, but rests nowhere. The most intelligent\nbusinessmen desire simple truth such as Christ gave to the people\nwhen He was on this earth\u2014the truth that He declares to be spirit[136]\nand life. His words are as the leaves of the tree of life. What the\nworld needs today is the light of Christ\u2019s example reflected from\nthe lives of Christlike men and women. The intellect most powerful\nin behalf of truth is the intellect that Christ controls, ennobling and\npurifying it by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit.\n* * * * *\nChrist has given His commission: \u201cGo ye into all the world.\u201d\nMark 16:15. All must hear the message of warning. A prize of\nrichest value is held up before those who are running the Christian\nrace. Those who run with patience will receive a crown of life that\nfadeth not away.\n* * * * *\nCultivate restfulness, and commit the keeping of your souls unto\nGod as unto a faithful Creator. He will keep that which is committed\nto His trust. He is not pleased to have us cover His altar with our\ntears and complaints. You have enough to praise God for already, if\nyou do not see another soul converted. But the good work will go\non if you will only go forward and not be trying to adjust everything\nto your own ideas. Let the peace of God rule in your hearts, and be\nye thankful. Let the Lord have room to work. Do not block His way.\nHe can and will work if we will let Him.\n* * * * *\nAppeal to Laymen 117\nWhile extensive plans should be laid, great care must be taken\nthat the work in each branch of the cause be harmoniously united\nwith that in every other branch, thus making a perfect whole.\nChapter 14\u2014Words of Counsel to Ministers[137]\nSanitarium, California,\nNovember 3, 1901\nTo a Worker of Long Experience in New York City\u2014\nAs I have considered the situation in New York, a great burden\nhas come upon my soul. In the night season matters have been\npresented to me in this light: New York will be worked; openings\nwill be found in parts of the city in which there are no churches,\nwhere the truth will find standing room. There is a vast amount\nof work to be done in proclaiming the truth for this time to those\nwho are dead in trespasses and sins. Most startling messages will\nbe borne by men of God\u2019s appointment, messages of a character to\nwarn the people, to arouse them. And while some will be provoked\nby the warning and led to resist light and evidence, we are to see\nfrom this that we are giving the testing message for this time.\nMessages will be given out of the usual order. The judgments of\nGod are in the land. While city missions must be established where\ncolporteurs, Bible workers, and practical medical missionaries may\nbe trained to reach certain classes, we must also have, in our cities,\nconsecrated evangelists through whom a message is to be borne so\ndecidedly as to startle the hearers.\n\u201cBring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that\nhave ears. Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the\npeople be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show\nus former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses, that they\nmay be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth. Ye are My\nwitnesses, saith the Lord, and My servant whom I have chosen: that[138]\nye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He: before\nMe there was no God formed, neither shall there be after Me. I, even\nI, am the Lord; and beside Me there is no savior. I have declared,\nand have saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange God\namong you: therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the Lord, that I am\nGod. Yea, before the day was I am He; and there is none that can\n118\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 119\ndeliver out of My hand: I will work, and who shall let it?\u201d Isaiah\n43:8-13.\n\u201cI will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead\nthem in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light\nbefore them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do\nunto them, and not forsake them. They shall be turned back, they\nshall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to\nthe molten images, Ye are our gods. Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye\nblind, that ye may see. Who is blind, but My servant? or deaf, as\nMy messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and\nblind as the Lord\u2019s servant? Seeing many things, but thou observest\nnot; opening the ears, but he heareth not. The Lord is well pleased\nfor His righteousness\u2019 sake; He will magnify the law, and make it\nhonorable.\u201d Isaiah 42:16-21.\nThe work outlined in these scriptures is the work before us. The\nterms \u201cMy servant,\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d \u201cthe Lord\u2019s servant,\u201d mean anyone that\nthe Lord may select and appoint to do a certain work. He makes\nthem ministers of His will, though some who are selected may be as\nignorant of His will as was Nebuchadnezzar.\nGod will work for those of His people who will submit them-\nselves to the working of the Holy Spirit. He pledges His glory for [139]\nthe success of the Messiah and His kingdom. \u201cThus saith God the\nLord, He that created the heavens, and stretched them out; He that\nspread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; He that giveth\nbreath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:\nI the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine\nhand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people,\nfor a light of the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes, to bring out the\nprisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the\nprison house.\u201d\n\u201cWho among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and\nhear for the time to come?\u201d Verses 5-7, 23.\nThe people of God who have had light and knowledge have\nnot carried out the high and holy purposes of God. They have not\nadvanced from victory to victory, adding new territory, lifting up the\nstandard in the cities and their suburbs. Great spiritual blindness has\nbeen shown by those who have had great light flashed upon them\nby the Lord, but who have not advanced in the light to greater and\n120 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nstill greater light. Church members have not been encouraged to use\nspiritual nerve and muscle in the work of advancement. They should\nbe made to understand that ministers cannot work out their salvation\nby hovering over them. It is thus that they are made weaklings when\nthey ought to be strong men.\nIn every church young men and young women should be se-\nlected to bear responsibilities. Let them make every effort to qualify\nthemselves to help those who know not the truth. God calls for\nearnest, whole-souled workers. The humble and contrite will learn\nby personal experience that beside Him there is no savior.\nBible truth must be preached and practiced. Every ray of light[140]\ngiven is to shine forth with clear, distinct brightness. The truth is\nto go forth as a lamp that burneth. There are hundreds of God\u2019s\nservants who must respond to this call and take the field as earnest,\nsoul-saving workers, coming up to the help of the Lord, to the help\nof the Lord against the mighty. God calls for live men, men who are\nfilled with the vivifying influence of His Spirit, men who see God\nas the Supreme Ruler and receive from Him abundant proof of the\nfulfillment of His promises, men who are not lukewarm, but hot and\nfervent with His love.\nShould all the labor that has been expended on the churches\nduring the past twenty years be again expended upon them, it would\nfail, as it has failed in the past, of making the members self-denying,\ncross-bearing followers of Christ. Many have been overfed with\nspiritual food, while in the world thousands are perishing for the\nbread of life. Church members must work; they must educate them-\nselves, striving to reach the high standard set before them. This the\nLord will help them to reach if they will co-operate with Him. If\nthey keep their own souls in the love of the truth they will not hold\nthe ministers back from presenting the truth in new fields.\nThe large cities should have been worked just as soon as the\nchurches received the light, but many have carried no burden for\nsouls, and Satan, finding them susceptible to his temptations, has\nspoiled their experience. God asks His people to repent, to be\nconverted, and to return to their first love, which they have lost\nby their failure to follow in the footsteps of the self-sacrificing\nRedeemer.\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 121\nIn Courage And Simplicity [141]\nThe time has come to make decided efforts in places where the\ntruth has not yet been proclaimed. How shall the Lord\u2019s work be\ndone? In every place that is entered, a solid foundation is to be laid\nfor permanent work. The Lord\u2019s methods are to be followed. It\nis not for you to be intimidated by outward appearances, however\nforbidding they may be. It is for you to carry forward the work as the\nLord has said it should be carried. Preach the word, and the Lord by\nHis Holy Spirit will send conviction to the minds of the hearers. The\nword is: \u201cAnd they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord\nworking with them, and confirming the word with signs following.\u201d\nMark 16:20.\nMany workers are to act their part, doing house-to-house work\nand giving Bible readings in families. They are to show their growth\nin grace by submission to the will of Christ. Thus they will gain a\nrich experience. As in faith they receive, believe, and obey Christ\u2019s\nword, the efficiency of the Holy Spirit will be seen in their lifework.\nThere will be seen an intensity of earnest effort. There will be\ncherished a faith that works by love and purifies the soul. The fruits\nof the Spirit will be seen in the life.\nChrist is the Light of the world. Those who follow Him do not\nwalk in darkness, but have the light of life. John declares of Christ:\n\u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the\nsons of God, even to them that believe on His name.\u201d John 1:12.\nBehold Christ. Beholding Him brings heart and mind and character\ninto conformity to the will of God.\nThere is need of all the instruction that our missions can give. [142]\nContinue in your work in the power of the same Spirit that led in its\nestablishment. By opening the Scriptures, by praying, by exercising\nfaith, educate the people in the way of the Lord; and there will be\nbuilt up a church founded on the Rock, Christ Jesus.\nThe work must be carried forward in the simplicity of truth. God\nsays: \u201cI have words of encouragement for you.\u201d The Lord has in our\nlarge cities many precious souls who have not bowed the knee to\nBaal, and He has those who have worshiped Baal ignorantly. On\nthese the light of truth is to shine, that they may see Christ as the\nway, the truth, and the life.\n122 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nCarry forward your work in humility. Never rise above the\nsimplicity of the gospel of Christ. Not in the art of display, but in\nlifting up Christ, the sin-pardoning Redeemer, will you find success\nin winning souls. As you work for God in humility and lowliness of\nheart, He will manifest Himself to you.\nBy the use of charts, symbols, and representations of various\nkinds the minister can make the truth stand out clearly and distinctly.\nThis is a help, and in harmony with the word of God; but when\nthe worker makes his labors so expensive that others are unable to\nsecure from the treasury sufficient means to support them in the\nfield, he is not working in harmony with God\u2019s plan. The work in\nthe large cities is to be done after Christ\u2019s order, not after the order\nof a theatrical performance. It is not a theatrical performance that\nglorifies God, but the presentation of the truth in the love of Christ.\nDo not divest the truth of its dignity and impressiveness by\npreliminaries that are more after the order of the world than after the\norder of heaven. Let your hearers understand that you hold meetings,\nnot to charm their senses with music and other things, but to preach[143]\nthe truth in all its solemnity, that it may come to them as a warning,\narousing them from their deathlike sleep of self-indulgence. It is the\nnaked truth that like a sharp, two-edged sword cuts both ways. It is\nthis that will arouse those who are dead in trespasses and sins.\nHe who gave His life to save men and women from idolatry\nand self-indulgence left an example to be followed by all who take\nup the work of presenting the gospel to others. God\u2019s servants in\nthis age have been given most solemn truths to proclaim, and their\nactions and methods and plans must correspond to the importance of\ntheir message. If you are presenting the word in Christ\u2019s way, your\naudience will be deeply impressed with the truths you teach. The\nconviction will come to them that this is the word of the living God.\nFormality In Worship\nIn their efforts to reach the people, the Lord\u2019s messengers are not\nto follow the ways of the world. In the meetings that are held, they\nare not to depend on worldly singers and theatrical display to awaken\nan interest. How can those who have no interest in the word of God,\nwho have never read His word with a sincere desire to understand\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 123\nits truths, be expected to sing with the spirit and the understanding?\nHow can their hearts be in harmony with the words of sacred song?\nHow can the heavenly choir join in music that is only a form?\nThe evil of formal worship cannot be too strongly depicted, but\nno words can properly set forth the deep blessedness of genuine\nworship. When human beings sing with the spirit and the under-\nstanding, heavenly musicians take up the strain and join in the song\nof thanksgiving. He who has bestowed upon us all the gifts that [144]\nenable us to be workers together with God, expects His servants to\ncultivate their voices so that they can speak and sing in a way that\nall can understand. It is not loud singing that is needed, but clear\nintonation, correct pronunciation, and distinct utterance. Let all take\ntime to cultivate the voice so that God\u2019s praise can be sung in clear,\nsoft tones, not with harshness and shrillness that offend the ear. The\nability to sing is the gift of God; let it be used to His glory.\nIn the meetings held let a number be chosen to take part in the\nsong service. And let the singing be accompanied with musical\ninstruments skillfully handled. We are not to oppose the use of\ninstrumental music in our work. This part of the service is to be\ncarefully conducted, for it is the praise of God in song.\nThe singing is not always to be done by a few. As often as\npossible, let the entire congregation join.\nUnity In Diversity\nIn our efforts in behalf of the multitudes dwelling in cities, we\nmust try to do thorough service. The work in a large center of\npopulation is greater than one man can successfully handle. God has\ndifferent ways of working, and He has different workmen to whom\nHe entrusts varied gifts.\nOne worker may be a ready speaker; another a ready writer;\nanother may have the gift of sincere, earnest, fervent prayer; another\nthe gift of singing; another may have special power to explain the\nword of God with clearness. And each gift is to become a power for\nGod because He works with the laborer. To one God gives the word\nof wisdom, to another knowledge, to another faith; but all are to\nwork under the same Head. The diversity of gifts leads to a diversity [145]\n124 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nof operations, but \u201cit is the same God which worketh all in all.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 12:6.\nThe Lord desires His chosen servants to learn how to unite\ntogether in harmonious effort. It may seem to some that the contrast\nbetween their gifts and the gifts of a fellow laborer is too great to\nallow them to unite in harmonious effort; but when they remember\nthat there are varied minds to be reached, and that some will reject\nthe truth as it is presented by one laborer, only to open their hearts\nto God\u2019s truth as it is presented in a different manner by another\nlaborer, they will hopefully endeavor to labor together in unity. Their\ntalents, however diverse, may all be under the control of the same\nSpirit. In every word and act, kindness and love will be revealed;\nand as each worker fills his appointed place faithfully, the prayer of\nChrist for the unity of His followers will be answered, and the world\nwill know that these are His disciples.\nIn loving sympathy and confidence God\u2019s workers are to unite\nwith one another. He who says or does anything that tends to sepa-\nrate the members of Christ\u2019s church is counterworking the Lord\u2019s\npurpose. Wrangling and dissension in the church, the encourage-\nment of suspicion and unbelief, are dishonoring to Christ. God\ndesires His servants to cultivate Christian affection for one another.\nTrue religion unites hearts not only with Christ, but with one another\nin a most tender union. When we know what it means to be thus\nunited with Christ and with our brethren, a fragrant influence will\nattend our work wherever we go.\nThe workers in the large cities must act their several parts, mak-\ning every effort to bring about the best results. They are to talk faith\nand to act in such a way as to impress the people. They are not[146]\nto narrow the work down to their own particular ideas. In the past\ntoo much of this has been done by us as a people, and it has been\na drawback to the success of the work. Let us remember that the\nLord has different ways of working, that He has different workmen\nto whom He entrusts different gifts. We are to see His purpose in\nthe sending of certain men to certain places.\nA little longer will the voice of mercy be heard; a little longer\nwill be given the gracious invitation: \u201cIf any man thirst, let him come\nunto Me, and drink.\u201d John 7:37. God sends His warning message to\nthe cities everywhere. Let the messengers whom He sends work so\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 125\nharmoniously that all will take knowledge that they have learned of\nJesus.\nIn The Meekness Of Christ\nNo human being is to seek to bind other human beings to himself\nas if he were to control them, telling them to do this and forbidding\nthem to do that, commanding, dictating, acting like an officer over\na company of soldiers. This is the way the priests and rulers did in\nChrist\u2019s day, but it is not the right way. After the truth has made\nthe impression upon hearts, and men and women have accepted its\nteachings, they are to be treated as the property of Christ, not as the\nproperty of man. In fastening minds to yourself, you lead them to\ndisconnect from the source of their wisdom and sufficiency. Their\ndependence must be wholly in God; only thus can they grow in\ngrace.\nHowever large may be a man\u2019s claim to knowledge and wisdom,\nunless he is under the teaching of the Holy Spirit he is exceedingly\nignorant of spiritual things. He needs to realize his danger and his [147]\ninefficiency, and to place entire dependence upon the One who alone\nis able to keep the souls committed to His trust, able to imbue them\nwith His Spirit, and to fill them with unselfish love for one another,\nthus enabling them to bear witness that God has sent His Son into\nthe world to save sinners. Those who are truly converted will press\ntogether in Christian unity. Let there be no division in the church of\nGod, no unwise authority exercised over those who accept the truth.\nThe meekness of Christ is to appear in all that is said and done.\nChrist is the foundation of every true church. We have His\nunalterable promise that His presence and protection will be given to\nHis faithful ones who walk in His counsel. To the end of time Christ\nis to be first. He is the source of life and strength, of righteousness\nand holiness. And He is all this to those who wear His yoke and\nlearn of Him how to be meek and lowly.\nThe duty and delight of all service is to uplift Christ before the\npeople. This is the end of all true labor. Let Christ appear; let self\nbe hidden behind Him. This is self-sacrifice that is of worth. Such\nself-sacrifice God accepts. Thus saith the high and lofty One that\ninhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy\n126 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nplace, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive\nthe spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.\u201d\nIsaiah 57:15.\nMeeting Opposition\nOften, as you seek to present the truth, opposition will be\naroused; but if you seek to meet the opposition with argument you\nwill only multiply it, and that you cannot afford to do. Hold to the\naffirmative. Angels of God are watching you, and they understand[148]\nhow to impress those whose opposition you refuse to meet with\nargument. Dwell not on the negative points of questions that arise,\nbut gather to your minds affirmative truths, and fasten them there by\nmuch study and earnest prayer and heart consecration. Keep your\nlamps trimmed and burning, and let bright rays shine forth, that men,\nbeholding your good works, may be led to glorify your Father which\nis in heaven.\nIf Christ had not held to the affirmative in the wilderness of temp-\ntation, He would have lost all that He desired to gain. Christ\u2019s way is\nthe best way to meet our opponents. We strengthen their arguments\nwhen we repeat what they say. Keep always to the affirmative. It\nmay be that the very man who is opposing you will carry your words\nhome and be converted to the sensible truth that has reached his\nunderstanding.\nI have often said to our brethren: \u201cYour opponents will make\nstatements about your work that are false. Do not repeat their state-\nments; but hold to your assertions of the living truth, and angels of\nGod will open the way before you. We have a great work to carry\nforward, and we must carry it in a sensible way. Let us never get\nexcited or allow evil feelings to arise. Christ did not do this, and He\nis our example in all things. For the work given us to do we need\nmuch more of heavenly, sanctified, humble wisdom, and much less\nof self. We need to lay hold firmly on divine power.\u201d\nThose who have departed from the faith will come to our con-\ngregations to divert our attention from the work that God would\nhave done. You cannot afford to turn your ears from the truth to\nfables. Do not stop to try to convert the one who is speaking words[149]\nof reproach against your work; but let it be seen that you are inspired\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 127\nby the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and angels of God will put into your\nlips words that will reach the hearts of the opposers. If these men\npersist in pressing their way in, those who are of a sensible mind in\nthe congregation will understand that yours is the higher standard.\nSo speak that it will be known that Jesus Christ is speaking through\nyou.\nThe Need of Earnest, Whole-Souled Labor\nIf our ministers realized how soon the inhabitants of the world\nare to be arraigned before the judgment seat of God, to answer for\nthe deeds done in the body, how earnestly they would work together\nwith God to present the truth! How untiringly they would labor to\nadvance God\u2019s cause in the world, proclaiming in word and deed:\n\u201cThe end of all things is at hand.\u201d 1 Peter 4:7.\n\u201cPrepare to meet thy God\u201d is the message we are everywhere\nto proclaim. The trumpet is to give a certain sound. Clearly and\ndistinctly the warning is to ring out: \u201cBabylon the great is fallen, is\nfallen.... Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her\nsins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.\u201d Revelation 18:2-4. The\nwords of this scripture are to be fulfilled. Soon the last test is to come\nto all the inhabitants of the earth. At that time prompt decisions will\nbe made. Those who have been convicted under the presentation of\nthe word will range themselves under the blood-stained banner of\nPrince Immanuel. They will see and understand as never before they\nhave missed many opportunities for doing the good they ought to\nhave done. They will realize that they have not worked as zealously [150]\nas they should, to seek and save the lost, to snatch them, as it were,\nout of the fire.\nGod\u2019s servants are to be \u201cnot slothful in business; fervent in\nspirit; serving the Lord.\u201d Listlessness and inefficiency are not piety.\nWhen we realize that we are working for God we shall have a higher\nsense than we have ever had before of the sacredness of spiritual\nservice. This realization will put life and vigilance and persevering\nenergy into the discharge of every duty.\nReligion, pure, undefiled religion, is intensely practical. Nothing\nbut earnest, wholehearted labor will avail in the saving of souls.\nWe are to make our everyday duties acts of devotion, constantly\n128 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nincreasing in usefulness, because we see our work in the light of\neternity.\nOur work has been marked out for us by our heavenly Father.\nWe are to take our Bibles and go forth to warn the world. We are to\nbe God\u2019s helping hands in saving souls\u2014channels through which\nHis love is day by day to flow to the perishing. The realization of\nthe great work in which he has the privilege of taking part, ennobles\nand sanctifies the true worker. He is filled with the faith that works\nby love and purifies the soul. Nothing is drudgery to the one who\nsubmits to the will of God. \u201cDoing it unto the Lord\u201d is a thought\nthat throws a charm over whatever work God gives him to do.\nCarry on all your work on strictly religious principles. Let your\nearnest inquiry be: \u201cWhat can I do to please the Master?\u201d Visit\nplaces where the believers need encouragement and help. At every\nstep ask: \u201cIs this the way of the Lord? Am I, in spirit, in word, in\naction, in harmony with His will?\u201d If you labor for God with an eye\nsingle to His glory, your work will bear the divine mold, and you[151]\nwill be carrying out the Lord\u2019s purposes.\nIn your study of the word of God, penetrate deeper and still\ndeeper beneath the surface. Lay hold by faith on divine power and\nsound the depths of inspiration. Bring into your ministry the power\nof God, remembering that the Lord is behind you. Let His love shine\nthrough all you do and say. Let the truth, the precious, simple truth\nof the word of God, shine out in full brightness. Humble self before\nGod. Christ will be your efficiency. He has appointed you as rulers\nover His household, to give meat in due season. Christ\u2019s laborers\nare very near His heart of love. He desires to perfect His household\nthrough the perfection of His ministers.\n* * * * *\nChrist is the sympathetic, compassionate Redeemer. In His\nsustaining power, men and women become strong to resist evil.\nAs the convicted sinner looks at sin, it becomes to him exceeding\nsinful. He wonders that he did not come to Christ before. He sees\nthat his faults must be overcome and that his appetites and passions\nmust be subjected to God\u2019s will, that he must be a partaker of the\ndivine nature, having overcome the corruption that is in the world\nWords of Counsel to Ministers 129\nthrough lust. Having repented of his transgression of God\u2019s law,\nhe strives earnestly to overcome sin. He seeks to reveal the power\nof Christ\u2019s grace, and he is brought into personal touch with the\nSaviour. Constantly he keeps Christ before him. Praying, believing,\nreceiving the blessings he needs, he comes nearer and nearer to\nGod\u2019s standard for him.\nNew virtues are revealed in his character as he denies self and\nlifts the cross, following where Christ leads the way. He loves the\nLord Jesus with his whole heart, and Christ becomes his wisdom, [152]\nhis righteousness, his sanctification, and his redemption.\nChrist is our example, our inspiration, our exceeding great re-\nward. \u201cYe are God\u2019s husbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d 1 Corinthi-\nans 3:9. God is the Master Builder, but man has a part to act. He is\nto co-operate with God. \u201cWe are laborers together with God.\u201d Verse\n9. Never forget the words: \u201c together with God.\u201d \u201cWork out your\nown salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh\nin you both to will and to do of His good pleasure.\u201d Philippians 2:12,\n13. The miracle-working power of Christ\u2019s grace is revealed in the\ncreation in man of a new heart, a higher life, a holier enthusiasm.\nGod says: A new heart also will I give you.\u201d Ezekiel 36:26. Is not\nthis, the renewal of man, the greatest miracle that can be performed?\nWhat cannot the human agent do who by faith takes hold of the\ndivine power?\n* * * * *\nRemember that in working with Christ as your personal Saviour\nlies your strength and your victory. This is the part all are to act.\nChrist is the way, the truth, and the life. He declares: \u201cWithout Me\nye can do nothing.\u201d John 15:5. And the repentant, believing soul\nresponds: \u201cI can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth\nme.\u201d Philippians 4:13. To those who do this comes the assurance:\n\u201cAs many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the\nsons of God.\u201d John 1:12.\n130 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nSection 4\u2014The Health Work [153]\n\u201cBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be\nin health. \u201d 3 John 1:2.\nChapter 15\u2014Faithfulness in Health Reform\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the General Conference,\nWashington D. C., May 31, 1909.]\nI am instructed to bear a message to all our people on the sub-\nject of health reform, for many have backslidden from their former\nloyalty to health reform principles.\nGod\u2019s purpose for His children is that they shall grow up to the\nfull stature of men and women in Christ. In order to do this, they\nmust use aright every power of mind, soul, and body. They cannot\nafford to waste any mental or physical strength.\nThe question of how to preserve the health is one of primary\nimportance. When we study this question in the fear of God we\nshall learn that it is best, for both our physical and our spiritual\nadvancement, to observe simplicity in diet. Let us patiently study\nthis question. We need knowledge and judgment in order to move\nwisely in this matter. Nature\u2019s laws are not to be resisted, but obeyed.\nThose who have received instruction regarding the evils of the\nuse of flesh foods, tea and coffee, and rich and unhealthful food\npreparations, and who are determined to make a covenant with God\nby sacrifice, will not continue to indulge their appetite for food that\nthey know to be unhealthful. God demands that the appetites be\ncleansed, and that self-denial be practiced in regard to those things[154]\nwhich are not good. This is a work that will have to be done before\nHis people can stand before Him a perfected people.\nPersonal Responsibility\nThe remnant people of God must be a converted people. The\npresentation of this message is to result in the conversion and sanc-\ntification of souls. We are to feel the power of the Spirit of God\nin this movement. This is a wonderful, definite message; it means\neverything to the receiver, and it is to be proclaimed with a loud cry.\n132\nFaithfulness in Health Reform 133\nWe must have a true, abiding faith that this message will go forth\nwith increasing importance till the close of time.\nThere are some professed believers who accept certain portions\nof the Testimonies as the message of God, while they reject those\nportions that condemn their favorite indulgences. Such persons are\nworking contrary to their own welfare and the welfare of the church.\nIt is essential that we walk in the light while we have the light.\nThose who claim to believe in health reform, and yet work counter\nto its principles in the daily life practice, are hurting their own souls\nand are leaving wrong impressions upon the minds of believers and\nunbelievers.\nStrength Through Obedience\nA solemn responsibility rests upon those who know the truth, that\nall their works shall correspond with their faith, and that their lives\nshall be refined and sanctified, and they be prepared for the work\nthat must rapidly be done in these closing days of the message. They\nhave no time or strength to spend in the indulgence of appetite. The\nwords should come to us now with impelling earnestness: \u201cRepent [155]\nye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out,\nwhen the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the\nLord.\u201d Acts 3:19. There are many among us who are deficient in\nspirituality and who, unless they are wholly converted, will certainly\nbe lost. Can you afford to run the risk?\nPride and weakness of faith are depriving many of the rich bless-\nings of God. There are many who, unless they humble their hearts\nbefore the Lord, will be surprised and disappointed when the cry\nis heard: \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh.\u201d Matthew 25:6. They\nhave the theory of the truth, but they have no oil in their vessels with\ntheir lamps. Our faith at this time must not stop with an assent to, or\nbelief in, the theory of the third angel\u2019s message. We must have the\noil of the grace of Christ that will feed the lamp and cause the light\nof life to shine forth, showing the way to those who are in darkness.\nIf we would escape having a sickly experience, we must begin\nin earnest without delay to work out our own salvation with fear and\ntrembling. There are many who give no decided evidence that they\nare true to their baptismal vows. Their zeal is chilled by formality,\n134 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nworldly ambition, pride, and love of self. Occasionally their feelings\nare stirred, but they do not fall on the Rock, Christ Jesus. They\ndo not come to God with hearts that are broken in repentance and\nconfession. Those who experience the work of true conversion in\ntheir hearts will reveal the fruits of the Spirit in their lives. Oh, that\nthose who have so little spiritual life would realize that eternal life\ncan be granted only to those who become partakers of the divine\nnature and escape the corruption that is in the world through lust!\nThe power of Christ alone can work the transformation in heart[156]\nand mind that all must experience who would partake with Him\nof the new life in the kingdom of heaven. \u201cExcept a man be born\nagain,\u201d the Saviour has said, \u201che cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d\nJohn 3:3. The religion that comes from God is the only religion that\ncan lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born of the\ndivine Spirit. This will lead to watchfulness. It will purify the heart\nand renew the mind, and give us a new capacity for knowing and\nloving God. It will give us willing obedience to all His requirements.\nThis is true worship.\nGod requires of His people continual advancement. We need\nto learn that indulged appetite is the greatest hindrance to mental\nimprovement and soul sanctification. With all our profession of\nhealth reform, many of us eat improperly. Indulgence of appetite is\nthe greatest cause of physical and mental debility, and lies largely at\nthe foundation of feebleness and premature death. Let the individual\nwho is seeking to possess purity of spirit bear in mind that in Christ\nthere is power to control the appetite.\nFlesh Foods\nIf we could be benefited by indulging the desire for flesh foods,\nI would not make this appeal to you; but I know we cannot. Flesh\nfoods are injurious to the physical well-being, and we should learn\nto do without them. Those who are in a position where it is possi-\nble to secure a vegetarian diet, but who choose to follow their own\npreferences in this matter, eating and drinking as they please, will\ngradually grow careless of the instruction the Lord has given regard-\ning other phases of the present truth and will lose their perception of[157]\nwhat is truth; they will surely reap as they have sown.\nFaithfulness in Health Reform 135\nI have been instructed that the students in our schools are not to\nbe served with flesh foods or with food preparations that are known\nto be unhealthful. Nothing that will serve to encourage a desire for\nstimulants should be placed on the tables. I appeal to old and young\nand to middle-aged. Deny your appetite of those things that are\ndoing you injury. Serve the Lord by sacrifice.\nLet the children have an intelligent part in this work. We are\nall members of the Lord\u2019s family, and the Lord would have His\nchildren, young and old, determine to deny appetite and to save the\nmeans needed for the building of meetinghouses and the support of\nmissionaries.\nI am instructed to say to parents: Place yourselves, soul and\nspirit, on the Lord\u2019s side of this question. We need ever to bear in\nmind that in these days of probation we are on trial before the Lord\nof the universe. Will you not give up indulgences that are doing you\ninjury? Words of profession are cheap; let your acts of self-denial\ntestify that you will be obedient to the demands that God makes\nof His peculiar people. Then put into the treasury a portion of the\nmeans you save by your acts of self-denial, and there will be that\nwith which to carry on the work of God.\nThere are many who feel that they cannot get along without\nflesh food; but if these would place themselves on the Lord\u2019s side,\nresolutely resolved to walk in the way of His guidance, they would\nreceive strength and wisdom as did Daniel and his fellows. They\nwould find that the Lord would give them sound judgment. Many\nwould be surprised to see how much could be saved for the cause\nof God by acts of self-denial. The small sums saved by deeds of [158]\nsacrifice will do more for the upbuilding of the cause of God than\nlarger gifts will accomplish that have not called for denial of self.\nSeventh-day Adventists are handling momentous truths. More\nthan forty years ago the Lord gave us special light on health reform,\nbut how are we walking in that light? How many have refused to\nlive in harmony with the counsels of God! As a people, we should\nmake advancement proportionate to the light received. It is our duty\nto understand and respect the principles of health reform. On the\nsubject of temperance we should be in advance of all other people;\nand yet there are among us well-instructed members of the church,\nand even ministers of the gospel, who have little respect for the light\n136 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthat God has given upon this subject. They eat as they please and\nwork as they please.\nLet those who are teachers and leaders in our cause take their\nstand firmly on Bible ground in regard to health reform, and give a\nstraight testimony to those who believe we are living in the last days\nof this earth\u2019s history. A line of distinction must be drawn between\nthose who serve God and those who serve themselves.\nI have been shown that the principles that were given us in the\nearly days of the message are as important and should be regarded\njust as conscientiously today as they were then. There are some who\nhave never followed the light given on the question of diet. It is now\ntime to take the light from under the bushel and let it shine forth in\nclear, bright rays.\nThe principles of healthful living mean a great deal to us indi-\nvidually and as a people. When the message of health reform first\ncame to me, I was weak and feeble, subject to frequent fainting\nspells. I was pleading with God for help, and He opened before\nme the great subject of health reform. He instructed me that those\nwho are keeping His commandments must be brought into sacred[159]\nrelation to Himself, and that by temperance in eating and drinking\nthey must keep mind and body in the most favorable condition for\nservice. This light has been a great blessing to me. I took my stand\nas a health reformer, knowing that the Lord would strengthen me. I\nhave better health today, notwithstanding my age, than I had in my\nyounger days.\nIt is reported by some that I have not followed the principles of\nhealth reform as I have advocated them with my pen; but I can say\nthat I have been a faithful health reformer. Those who have been\nmembers of my family know that this is true.\n\u201cTo the Glory of God\u201d\nWe do not mark out any precise line to be followed in diet; but\nwe do say that in countries where there are fruits, grains, and nuts\nin abundance, flesh food is not the right food for God\u2019s people. I\nhave been instructed that flesh food has a tendency to animalize the\nnature, to rob men and women of that love and sympathy which they\nshould feel for everyone, and to give the lower passions control over\nFaithfulness in Health Reform 137\nthe higher powers of the being. If meat eating was ever healthful, it\nis not safe now. Cancers, tumors, and pulmonary diseases are largely\ncaused by meat eating.\nWe are not to make the use of flesh food a test of fellowship, but\nwe should consider the influence that professed believers who use\nflesh foods have over others. As God\u2019s messengers, shall we not say\nto the people: \u201cWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever\nye do, do all to the glory of God\u201d? 1 Corinthians 10:31. Shall we\nnot bear a decided testimony against the indulgence of perverted\nappetite? Will any who are ministers of the gospel, proclaiming the\nmost solemn truth ever given to mortals, set an example in returning [160]\nto the fleshpots of Egypt? Will those who are supported by the\ntithe from God\u2019s storehouse permit themselves by self-indulgence\nto poison the life-giving current flowing through their veins? Will\nthey disregard the light and warnings that God has given them?\nThe health of the body is to be regarded as essential for growth in\ngrace and the acquirement of an even temper. If the stomach is\nnot properly cared for, the formation of an upright, moral character\nwill be hindered. The brain and nerves are in sympathy with the\nstomach. Erroneous eating and drinking result in erroneous thinking\nand acting.\nAll are now being tested and proved. We have been baptized\ninto Christ, and if we will act our part by separating from everything\nthat would drag us down and make us what we ought not to be, there\nwill be given us strength to grow up into Christ, who is our living\nhead, and we shall see the salvation of God.\nOnly when we are intelligent in regard to the principles of health-\nful living can we be fully aroused to see the evils resulting from\nimproper diet. Those who, after seeing their mistakes, have courage\nto change their habits, will find that the reformatory process requires\na struggle and much perseverance; but when correct tastes are once\nformed, they will realize that the use of the food which they formerly\nregarded as harmless was slowly but surely laying the foundation\nfor dyspepsia and other diseases.\nFathers and mothers, watch unto prayer. Guard strictly against\nintemperance in every form. Teach your children the principles of\ntrue health reform. Teach them what things to avoid in order to\npreserve health. Already the wrath of God has begun to be visited\n138 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nupon the children of disobedience. What crimes, what sins, what[161]\niniquitous practices, are being revealed on every hand! As a peo-\nple we are to exercise great care in guarding our children against\ndepraved associates.\nTeaching Health Principles\nGreater efforts should be put forth to educate the people in the\nprinciples of health reform. Cooking schools should be established,\nand house-to-house instruction should be given in the art of cooking\nwholesome food. Old and young should learn how to cook more\nsimply. Wherever the truth is presented, the people are to be taught\nhow to prepare food in a simple, yet appetizing way. They are to\nbe shown that a nourishing diet can be provided without the use of\nflesh foods.\nTeach the people that it is better to know how to keep well than\nhow to cure disease. Our physicians should be wise educators,\nwarning all against self-indulgence and showing that abstinence\nfrom the things that God has prohibited is the only way to prevent\nruin of body and mind.\nMuch tact and discretion should be employed in preparing nour-\nishing food to take the place of that which has formerly constituted\nthe diet of those who are learning to be health reformers. Faith in\nGod, earnestness of purpose, and a willingness to help one another\nwill be required. A diet lacking in the proper elements of nutrition\nbrings reproach upon the cause of health reform. We are mortal and\nmust supply ourselves with food that will give proper nourishment\nto the body.\nExtremes in Diet\nSome of our people, while conscientiously abstaining from eat-\ning improper foods, neglect to supply themselves with the elements[162]\nnecessary for the sustenance of the body. Those who take an ex-\ntreme view of health reform are in danger of preparing tasteless\ndishes, making them so insipid that they are not satisfying. Food\nshould be prepared in such a way that it will be appetizing as well as\nnourishing. It should not be robbed of that which the system needs.\nFaithfulness in Health Reform 139\nI use some salt, and always have, because salt, instead of being\ndeleterious, is actually essential for the blood. Vegetables should be\nmade palatable with a little milk or cream, or something equivalent.\nWhile warnings have been given regarding the dangers of disease\nthrough butter, and the evil of the free use of eggs by small children,\nyet we should not consider it a violation of principle to use eggs from\nhens that are well cared for and suitably fed. Eggs contain properties\nthat are remedial agencies in counteracting certain poisons.\nSome, in abstaining from milk, eggs, and butter, have failed to\nsupply the system with proper nourishment, and as a consequence\nhave become weak and unable to work. Thus health reform is\nbrought into disrepute. The work that we have tried to build up\nsolidly is confused with strange things that God has not required,\nand the energies of the church are crippled. But God will interfere\nto prevent the results of these too strenuous ideas. The gospel is to\nharmonize the sinful race. It is to bring the rich and poor together at\nthe feet of Jesus.\nThe time will come when we may have to discard some of the\narticles of diet we now use, such as milk and cream and eggs; but\nit is not necessary to bring upon ourselves perplexity by premature\nand extreme restrictions. Wait until the circumstances demand it and\nthe Lord prepares the way for it.\nThose who would be successful in proclaiming the principles of\nhealth reform must make the word of God their guide and counselor. [163]\nOnly as the teachers of health reform principles do this can they\nstand on vantage ground. Let us never bear a testimony against\nhealth reform by failing to use wholesome, palatable food in place\nof the harmful articles of diet that we have discarded. Do not in any\nway encourage an appetite for stimulants. Eat only plain, simple,\nwholesome food, and thank God constantly for the principles of\nhealth reform. In all things be true and upright, and you will gain\nprecious victories.\nDiet in Different Countries\nWhile working against gluttony and intemperance, we must\nrecognize the condition to which the human family is subjected.\nGod has made provision for those who live in the different countries\n140 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nof the world. Those who desire to be co-workers with God must\nconsider carefully before they specify just what foods should and\nshould not be eaten. We are to be brought into connection with the\nmasses. Should health reform in its most extreme form be taught to\nthose whose circumstances forbid its adoption, more harm than good\nwould be done. As I preach the gospel to the poor, I am instructed to\ntell them to eat that food which is most nourishing. I cannot say to\nthem: \u201cYou must not eat eggs, or milk, or cream. You must use no\nbutter in the preparation of food.\u201d The gospel must be preached to\nthe poor, but the time has not yet come to prescribe the strictest diet.\nA Word to the Wavering\nThose ministers who feel at liberty to indulge the appetite are\nfalling far short of the mark. God wants them to be health reformers.\nHe wants them to live up to the light that has been given on this\nsubject. I feel sad when I see those who ought to be zealous for our[164]\nhealth principles, not yet converted to the right way of living. I pray\nthat the Lord may impress their minds that they are meeting with\ngreat loss. If things were as they should be in the households that\nmake up our churches, we might do double work for the Lord.\nConditions of Answered Prayer\nIn order to be purified and to remain pure, Seventh-day Adven-\ntists must have the Holy Spirit in their hearts and in their homes.\nThe Lord has given me light that when the Israel of today humble\nthemselves before Him, and cleanse the soul-temple from all defile-\nment, He will hear their prayers in behalf of the sick and will bless\nin the use of His remedies for disease. When in faith the human\nagent does all he can to combat disease, using the simple methods of\ntreatment that God has provided, his efforts will be blessed of God.\nIf, after so much light has been given, God\u2019s people will cherish\nwrong habits, indulging self and refusing to reform, they will suffer\nthe sure consequences of transgression. If they are determined to\ngratify perverted appetite at any cost, God will not miraculously\nsave them from the consequences of their indulgence. They \u201cshall\nlie down in sorrow.\u201d Isaiah 50:11.\nFaithfulness in Health Reform 141\nThose who choose to be presumptuous, saying, \u201cThe Lord has\nhealed me, and I need not restrict my diet; I can eat and drink as\nI please,\u201d will erelong need, in body and soul, the restoring power\nof God. Because the Lord has graciously healed you, you must not\nthink you can link yourselves up with the self-indulgent practices of\nthe world. Do as Christ commanded after His work of healing\u2014\u201cgo,\nand sin no more.\u201d John 8:11. Appetite must not be your god.\nThe Lord gave His word to ancient Israel, that if they would [165]\ncleave strictly to Him and do all His requirements, He would keep\nthem from all the diseases such as He had brought upon the Egyp-\ntians; but this promise was given on the condition of obedience. Had\nthe Israelites obeyed the instruction they received, and profited by\ntheir advantages, they would have been the world\u2019s object lesson\nof health and prosperity. The Israelites failed of fulfilling God\u2019s\npurpose, and thus failed of receiving the blessings that might have\nbeen theirs. But in Joseph and Daniel, in Moses and Elijah, and\nmany others, we have noble examples of the results of the true plan\nof living. Like faithfulness today will produce like results. To us it\nis written: \u201cYe are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy\nnation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of\nHim who hath called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.\u201d\n1 Peter 2:9.\nSelf-Surrender and Rest\nOh, how many lose the richest blessings that God has in store\nfor them in health and spiritual endowments! There are many souls\nwho wrestle for special victories and special blessings that they may\ndo some great thing. To this end they are always feeling that they\nmust make an agonizing struggle in prayer and tears. When these\npersons search the Scriptures with prayer to know the expressed will\nof God, and then do His will from the heart without one reservation\nor self-indulgence, they will find rest. All the agonizing, all the tears\nand struggles, will not bring them the blessing they long for. Self\nmust be entirely surrendered. They must do the work that presents\nitself, appropriating the abundance of the grace of God which is\npromised to all who ask in faith.\n\u201cIf any man will come after Me,\u201d said Jesus, \u201clet him deny [166]\n142 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nhimself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me.\u201d Luke 9:23. Let\nus follow the Saviour in His simplicity and self-denial. Let us lift up\nthe Man of Calvary by word and by holy living. The Saviour comes\nvery near to those who consecrate themselves to God. If ever there\nwas a time when we needed the working of the Spirit of God upon\nour hearts and lives, it is now. Let us lay hold of this divine power\nfor strength to live a life of holiness and self-surrender.\n* * * * *\nThe word of God is to be our lessonbook. The Lord is our helper\nand our God. Let us look to Him to open the way for the carrying\nout of our plans.\nChapter 16\u2014A Plea For Medical Missionary [167]\nEvangelists\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the General Conference,\nWashington, D. C., June 1, 1909.]\nWe are living in the last days. The end of all things is at hand. The\nsigns foretold by Christ are fast fulfilling. There are stormy times\nbefore us, but let us not utter one word of unbelief or discouragement.\nHe who understands the necessities of the situation arranges that\nadvantages should be brought to the workers in various places to\nenable them more effectively to arouse the attention of the people.\nHe knows the needs and the necessities of the feeblest of His flock,\nand He sends His own message into the highways and the byways.\nHe loves us with an everlasting love. Let us remember that we bear\na message of healing to a world filled with sin-sick souls. May the\nLord increase our faith and help us to see that He desires us all to\nbecome acquainted with His ministry of healing and with the mercy\nseat. He desires the light of His grace to shine forth from many\nplaces.\nSanitariums as Missionary Agencies\nThere are souls in many places who have not yet heard the\nmessage. Henceforth medical missionary work is to be carried\nforward with an earnestness with which it has never yet been carried.\nThis work is the door through which the truth is to find entrance to\nthe large cities, and sanitariums are to be established in many places.\nSanitarium work is one of the most successful means of reaching\nall classes of people. Our sanitariums are the right hand of the gospel,\nopening ways whereby suffering humanity may be reached with the\nglad tidings of healing through Christ. In these institutions the sick [168]\nmay be taught to commit their cases to the Great Physician, who\nwill co-operate with their earnest efforts to regain health, bringing\nto them healing of soul as well as healing of body.\n143\n144 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nChrist is no longer in this world in person, to go through our cities\nand towns and villages, healing the sick; but He has commissioned\nus to carry forward the medical missionary work that He began. In\nthis work we are to do our very best. Institutions for the care of the\nsick are to be established, where men and women suffering from\ndisease may be placed under the care of God-fearing physicians and\nnurses, and be treated without drugs.\nI have been instructed that we are not to delay to do the work\nthat needs to be done in health reform lines. Through this work we\nare to reach souls in the highways and byways. I have been given\nspecial light that in our sanitariums many souls will receive and\nobey present truth. In these institutions men and women are to be\ntaught how to care for their own bodies and at the same time how\nto become sound in the faith. They are to be taught what is meant\nby eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son of God. Said\nChrist: \u201cThe words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they\nare life.\u201d John 6:63.\nOur sanitariums are to be schools in which instruction shall be\ngiven in medical missionary lines. They are to bring to sin-sick souls\nthe leaves of the tree of life, which will restore to them peace and\nhope and faith in Christ Jesus.\nLet the Lord\u2019s work go forward. Let the medical missionary and\nthe educational work go forward. I am sure that this is our great[169]\nlack\u2014earnest, devoted, intelligent, capable workers. In every large\ncity there should be a representation of true medical missionary\nwork. Let many now ask: \u201cLord, what wilt Thou have me to do?\u201d\nActs 9:6. It is the Lord\u2019s purpose that His method of healing without\ndrugs shall be brought into prominence in every large city through\nour medical institutions. God invests with holy dignity those who\ngo forth farther and still farther, in every place to which it is possible\nto obtain entrance. Satan will make the work as difficult as possible,\nbut divine power will attend all truehearted workers. Guided by\nour heavenly Father\u2019s hand, let us go forward, improving every\nopportunity to extend the work of God.\nThe Lord speaks to all medical missionaries, saying: Go, work\ntoday in My vineyard to save souls. God hears the prayers of all\nwho seek Him in truth. He has the power that we all need. He fills\nthe heart with love, and joy, and peace, and holiness. Character is\nPlea For Medical Missionary Evangelists 145\nconstantly being developed. We cannot afford to spend the time\nworking at cross-purposes with God.\nThere are physicians who, because of a past connection with our\nsanitariums, find it profitable to locate close to these institutions;\nand they close their eyes to the great field, neglected and unworked,\nin which unselfish labor would be a blessing to many. Missionary\nphysicians can exert an uplifting, refining, sanctifying influence.\nPhysicians who do not do this abuse their power and do a work that\nthe Lord repudiates.\nThe Training of Workers\nIf ever the Lord has spoken by me, He speaks when I say that\nthe workers engaged in educational lines, in ministerial lines, and in [170]\nmedical missionary lines must stand as a unit, all laboring under the\nsupervision of God, one helping the other, each blessing each.\nThose connected with our schools and sanitariums are to labor\nwith earnest alacrity. The work that is done under the ministration\nof the Holy Spirit, out of love for God and for humanity, will bear\nthe divine signature and will make its impression on human minds.\nThe Lord calls upon our young people to enter our schools and\nquickly fit themselves for service. In various places outside of\ncities, schools are to be established where our youth can receive an\neducation that will prepare them to go forth to do evangelical work\nand medical missionary work.\nThe Lord must be given an opportunity to show men their duty\nand to work upon their minds. No one is to bind himself to serve\nfor a term of years under the direction of one group of men or in\none specified branch of the Master\u2019s work; for the Lord Himself\nwill call men, as of old He called the humble fishermen, and will\nHimself give them instruction regarding their field of labor and the\nmethods they should follow. He will call men from the plow and\nfrom other occupations to give the last note of warning to perishing\nsouls. There are many ways in which to work for the Master, and\nthe Great Teacher will open the understanding of these workers,\nenabling them to see wondrous things in His word.\n146 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nNurses As Evangelists\nChrist, the great Medical Missionary, is our example. Of Him it is\nwritten that He \u201cwent about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,\nand preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner\nof sickness and all manner of disease among the people.\u201d Matthew[171]\n4:23. He healed the sick and preached the gospel. In His service,\nhealing and teaching were linked closely together. Today they are\nnot to be separated.\nThe nurses who are trained in our institutions are to be fitted up\nto go out as medical missionary evangelists, uniting the ministry of\nthe word with that of physical healing.\nWe must let our light shine amid the moral darkness. Many who\nare now in darkness, as they see a reflection of the Light of the world,\nwill realize that they have a hope of salvation. Your light may be\nsmall, but remember that it is what God has given you, and that He\nholds you responsible to let it shine forth. Someone may light his\ntaper from yours, and his light may be the means of leading others\nout from the darkness.\nAll around us are doors open for service. We should become\nacquainted with our neighbors and seek to draw them to Christ. As\nwe do this, He will approve and cooperate with us.\nOften the inhabitants of a city where Christ labored wished Him\nto stay with them and continue to work among them. But He would\ntell them that He must go to cities that had not heard the truths that\nHe had to present. After He had given the truth to those in one\nplace He left them to build upon what He had given them, while\nHe went to another place. His methods of labor are to be followed\ntoday by those to whom He has left His work. We are to go from\nplace to place, carrying the message. As soon as the truth has been\nproclaimed in one place, we are to go to warn others.\nThere should be companies organized and educated most thor-\noughly to work as nurses, as evangelists, as ministers, as canvassers,[172]\nas gospel students, to perfect a character after the divine similitude.\nTo prepare to receive the higher education in the school above is\nnow to be our purpose.\nFrom the instruction that the Lord has given me from time to\ntime, I know that there should be workers who make medical evan-\nPlea For Medical Missionary Evangelists 147\ngelistic tours among the towns and villages. Those who do this work\nwill gather a rich harvest of souls from both the higher and lower\nclasses. The way for this work is best prepared by the efforts of the\nfaithful canvasser.\nMany will be called into the field to labor from house to house,\ngiving Bible readings and praying with those who are interested.\nLet our ministers, who have gained an experience in preach-\ning the word, learn how to give simple treatments and then labor\nintelligently as medical missionary evangelists.\nWorkers\u2014gospel medical missionaries\u2014are needed now. You\ncannot afford to spend years in preparation. Soon doors now open to\nthe truth will be forever closed. Carry the message now. Do not wait,\nallowing the enemy to take possession of the fields now open before\nyou. Let little companies go forth to do the work to which Christ\nappointed His disciples. Let them labor as evangelists, scattering our\npublications and talking of the truth to those they meet. Let them\npray for the sick, ministering to their necessities, not with drugs, but\nwith nature\u2019s remedies, and teaching them how to regain health and\navoid disease.\nChapter 17\u2014The Loma Linda College of[173]\nEvangelists\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the General Conference,\nWashington, D.C., June 1, 1909.]\nWhile attending the General Conference of 1905, at Washington,\nD. C., I received a letter from J. A. Burden describing a property\nhe had found about four miles from Redlands. As I read his letter I\nwas impressed that this was one of the places I had seen in vision,\nand I immediately telegraphed him to secure the property without\ndelay. Later, when I visited the property, I recognized it as one of the\nplaces I had seen nearly two years before in vision. How thankful I\nam to the Lord our God for this place!\nOne of the chief advantages of Loma Linda is the pleasing variety\nof charming scenery on every side. The extensive view of valley\nand mountain is magnificent. But more important than magnificent\nscenery and beautiful buildings and spacious grounds is the close\nproximity of this institution to a densely populated district and the\nopportunity thus afforded of communicating to many, many people\na knowledge of the third angel\u2019s message. We are to have clear\nspiritual discernment, else we shall fail of discerning the opening\nprovidences of God that are preparing the way for us to enlighten\nthe world.\nWith the possession of this place comes the weighty responsi-\nbility of making the work of the institution educational in character.\nLoma Linda is to be not only a sanitarium, but an educational center.\nA school is to be established here for the training of gospel medical\nmissionary evangelists. Much is involved in this work, and it is very\nessential that a right beginning be made. The Lord has a special[174]\nwork to be done in this field. He instructed me to call on Elder and\nMrs. Haskell to help us in getting properly started a work similar to\nthat which they had carried on at Avondale. Laborers of experience\nhave consented to unite with the forces at Loma Linda to develop\n148\nLoma Linda College of Evangelists 149\nthe school that must be carried on there. As they go forward in faith,\nthe Lord will go before them, preparing the way.\nIn regard to the school I would say: Make it especially strong\nin the education of nurses and physicians. In medical missionary\nschools many workers are to be qualified with the ability of physi-\ncians to labor as medical missionary evangelists. This training, the\nLord has specified, is in harmony with the principles underlying true\nhigher education. We hear a great deal about the higher education.\nThe highest education is to follow in the footsteps of Christ, pat-\nterning after the example He gave when He was in the world. We\ncannot gain an education higher than this, for this class of training\nwill make men laborers together with God.\nTo have the higher education is to have a living connection\nwith Christ. The Saviour took the unlearned fishermen from their\nboats and their fishing nets and connected them with Himself as He\ntraveled from place to place, teaching the people and ministering to\ntheir needs. Sitting down on a rock or on some elevated place, He\nwould gather His disciples about Him and give them instruction, and,\nbefore long, hundreds of people would be listening to His words.\nThere are many men and women who suppose that they know all\nthat is worth knowing, when they greatly need to sit humbly at the\nfeet of Jesus and learn of Him who gave His life that He might\nredeem a fallen world. We all need Christ\u2014the One who left the\nroyal courts, laying off His kingly robe and crown and His majesty [175]\nin the heavens, and clothing Himself with humanity. The Son of\nGod came as a little babe, that He might understand the experiences\nof humanity and know how to deal with them. He knows the wants\nof the children. In the days of His earthly ministry He would not\nallow them to be forbidden to come to Him. Send them not away,\nHe said to His disciples, \u201cfor of such is the kingdom of heaven.\u201d\nIn the work of the school maintain simplicity. No argument is\nso powerful as is success founded on simplicity. You may attain\nsuccess in the education of students as medical missionaries without\na medical school that can qualify physicians to compete with the\nphysicians of the world. Let the students be given a practical educa-\ntion. The less dependent you are upon worldly methods of education,\nthe better it will be for the students. Special instruction should be\ngiven in the art of treating the sick without the use of poisonous\n150 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\ndrugs and in harmony with the light that God has given. In the treat-\nment of the sick, poisonous drugs need not be used. Students should\ncome forth from the school without having sacrificed the principles\nof health reform or their love for God and righteousness.\nThe education that meets the world\u2019s standard is to be less and\nless valued by those who are seeking for efficiency in carrying the\nmedical missionary work in connection with the work of the third\nangel\u2019s message. They are to be educated from the standpoint of\nconscience, and, as they conscientiously and faithfully follow right\nmethods in their treatment of the sick, these methods will come to be\nrecognized as preferable to the methods to which many have become\naccustomed, which demand the use of poisonous drugs.\nWe should not at this time seek to compete with worldly medical[176]\nschools. Should we do this, our chances of success would be small.\nWe are not now prepared to carry out successfully the work of\nestablishing large medical institutions of learning. Moreover, should\nwe follow the world\u2019s methods of medical practice, exacting the\nlarge fees that worldly physicians demand for their services, we\nwould work away from Christ\u2019s plan for our ministry to the sick.\nThere should be at our sanitariums intelligent men and women\nwho can instruct in Christ\u2019s methods of ministry. Under the in-\nstruction of competent, consecrated teachers the youth may become\npartakers of the divine nature and learn how to escape the corruption\nthat is in the world through lust. I have been instructed that we\nshould have many more women who can deal especially with the\ndiseases of women, many more lady nurses who will treat the sick\nin a simple way without the use of drugs.\nIt is not in harmony with the instruction given at Sinai that\ngentlemen physicians should do the work of midwives. The Bible\nspeaks of women at childbirth being attended by women, and thus\nit ought always to be. Women should be educated and trained to\nact skillfully as midwives and physicians to their sex. This is the\nLord\u2019s plan. Let us educate ladies to become intelligent in the work\nof treating the diseases of their sex. We ought to have a school where\nwomen can be educated by women physicians to do the best possible\nwork in treating the diseases of women. Among us as a people the\nmedical work should stand at its highest.\nLoma Linda College of Evangelists 151\nIn Loma Linda we have an advantageous center for the carrying\non of various missionary enterprises. We can see that it was in the\nprovidence of God that this sanitarium was placed in the possession [177]\nof our people. We should appreciate Loma Linda as a place which\nthe Lord foresaw we should need and which He gave us. There is\na very precious work to be done in connection with the interests of\nthe sanitarium and the school at Loma Linda, and this will be done,\nwhen we all work to that end, moving unitedly in God\u2019s order.\nAt Loma Linda many can be educated to work as missionaries in\nthe cause of health and temperance. Teachers are to be prepared for\nmany lines of work. Schools are to be established in places where\nas yet no efforts have been made. Missionaries are to go to other\nstates where little work has been done. The work of promulgating\nthe principles of health reform must be accomplished. God help us\nas a people to be wise.\nI feel a deep interest that careful study shall be given to the\nneeds of our institutions at Loma Linda and that right moves shall\nbe made. In the carrying forward of the work at this place, men of\ntalent and decided spirituality are needed. The best teachers are to be\nemployed in the educational work, men and women who will walk\ncircumspectly, depending wholly upon the Lord. If the teachers in\nmedical lines will stand in their place in the fear of God, we shall\nsee a good work done. With Christ as our educator we may reach a\nhigh standard in the knowledge of the true science of healing.\nThat which is of the most importance is that the students be\ntaught how to represent aright the principles of health reform. Teach\nthem to pursue this line of study faithfully, combined with other\nessential lines of education. The grace of Jesus Christ will give\nwisdom to all who follow the Lord\u2019s plan of true education. Let the\nstudents follow closely the example of the One who purchased the [178]\nhuman race with the costly price of His own life. Let them appeal to\nthe Saviour and depend upon Him as the One who heals all manner\nof diseases. The Lord would have the workers make special efforts\nto point the sick and suffering to the Great Physician who made the\nhuman body.\nIt is well that our training schools for Christian workers should\nbe established near to our health institutions, that the students may be\neducated in the principles of healthful living. Institutions that send\n152 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nforth workers who are able to give a reason for their faith, and who\nhave a faith which works by love and purifies the soul, are of great\nvalue. I have clear instruction that, wherever it is possible, schools\nshould be established near to our sanitariums, that each institution\nmay be a help and strength to the other. He who created man has an\ninterest in those who suffer. He has directed in the establishment\nof our sanitariums and in the building up of our schools close to\nour sanitariums, that they may become efficient mediums in training\nmen and women for the work of ministering to suffering humanity.\nLet Seventh-day Adventist medical workers remember that the\nLord God omnipotent reigneth. Christ was the greatest physician\nthat ever trod this sin-cursed earth. The Lord would have His people\ncome to Him for their power of healing. He will baptize them with\nHis Holy Spirit and fit them for a service that will make them a\nblessing in restoring the spiritual and physical health of those who\nneed healing.\nSection 5\u2014The Spirit of Unity [Portions of [179]\nthe tract, Special Testimonies, Series B, No.\n4, are included in this section.]\n\u201cThat they all may be one. \u201d John 17:21.\nChapter 18\u2014Unity Among Different Nationalities\n[Address delivered at the European Union Council, Basel,\nSwitzerland, September 24, 1885.]\n\u201cIf any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.\u201d \u201cWhoso-\never drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst;\nbut the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water\nspringing up into everlasting life.\u201d John 7:37; 4:14.\nIf, with these promises before us, we choose to remain parched\nand withered for want of the water of life, it is our own fault. If\nwe would come to Christ with the simplicity of a child coming to\nits earthly parents, and ask for the things that He has promised,\nbelieving that we receive them, we should have them. If all of us\nhad exercised the faith we should we would have been blessed with\nfar more of the Spirit of God in our meetings than we have yet\nreceived. I am glad that a few days of the meeting still remain. Now\nthe question is: Will we come to the fountain and drink? Will the\nteachers of truth set the example? God will do great things for us\nif we by faith take Him at His word. Oh, that we might see here a\ngeneral humbling of the heart before God!\nSince these meetings began, I have felt urged to dwell much\nupon love and faith. This is because you need this testimony. Some[180]\nwho have entered these missionary fields have said: \u201cYou do not\nunderstand the French people; you do not understand the Germans.\nThey have to be met in just such a way.\u201d\nBut I inquire: Does not God understand them? Is it not He who\ngives His servants a message for the people? He knows just what\nthey need; and if the message comes directly from Him through\nHis servants to the people, it will accomplish the work whereunto it\nis sent; it will make all one in Christ. Though some are decidedly\nFrench, others decidedly German, and others decidedly American,\nthey will be just as decidedly Christlike.\n154\nUnity Among Different Nationalities 155\nThe Jewish temple was built of hewn stones quarried out of the\nmountains; and every stone was fitted for its place in the temple,\nhewed, polished, and tested before it was brought to Jerusalem. And\nwhen all were brought to the ground, the building went together\nwithout the sound of ax or hammer. This building represents God\u2019s\nspiritual temple, which is composed of material gathered out of every\nnation, and tongue, and people, of all grades, high and low, rich and\npoor, learned and unlearned. These are not dead substances to be\nfitted by hammer and chisel. They are living stones, quarried out\nfrom the world by the truth; and the great Master Builder, the Lord\nof the temple, is now hewing and polishing them, and fitting them\nfor their respective places in the spiritual temple. When completed,\nthis temple will be perfect in all its parts, the admiration of angels\nand of men; for its Builder and Maker is God.\nLet no one think that there need not be a stroke placed upon\nhim. There is no person, no nation, that is perfect in every habit\nand thought. One must learn of another. Therefore God wants the\ndifferent nationalities to mingle together, to be one in judgment, one [181]\nin purpose. Then the union that there is in Christ will be exemplified.\nI was almost afraid to come to this country because I heard so\nmany say that the different nationalities of Europe were peculiar\nand had to be reached in a certain way. But the wisdom of God\nis promised to those who feel their need and who ask for it. God\ncan bring the people where they will receive the truth. Let the Lord\ntake possession of the mind and mold it as the clay is molded in the\nhands of the potter, and these differences will not exist. Look to\nJesus, brethren; copy His manners and spirit, and you will have no\ntrouble in reaching these different classes. We have not six patterns\nto follow, nor five; we have only one, and that is Christ Jesus. If the\nItalian brethren, the French brethren, and the German brethren try\nto be like Him, they will plant their feet upon the same foundation\nof truth; the same spirit that dwells in one will dwell in the other\u2014\nChrist in them, the hope of glory. I warn you, brethren and sisters,\nnot to build up a wall of partition between different nationalities. On\nthe contrary, seek to break it down wherever it exists. We should\nendeavor to bring all into the harmony that there is in Jesus, laboring\nfor the one object, the salvation of our fellow men.\n156 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nWill you, my ministering brethren, grasp the rich promises of\nGod? Will you put self out of sight and let Jesus appear? Self must\ndie before God can work through you. I feel alarmed as I see self\ncropping out in one and another here and there. I tell you, in the\nname of Jesus of Nazareth, your wills must die; they must become\nas God\u2019s will. He wants to melt you over and to cleanse you from\nevery defilement. There is a great work to be done for you before\nyou can be filled with the power of God. I beseech you to draw nigh[182]\nto Him, that you may realize His rich blessing before this meeting\ncloses.\nThere are those here upon whom great light in warnings and\nreproofs has shone. Whenever reproofs are given, the enemy seeks\nto create in those reproved a desire for human sympathy. Therefore\nI would warn you to beware lest in appealing to the sympathy of\nothers and going back over your past trials, you again err on the\nsame points in seeking to build yourselves up. The Lord brings His\nerring children over the same ground again and again; but if they\ncontinually fail to heed the admonitions of His Spirit, if they fail to\nreform on every point where they have erred, He will finally leave\nthem to their own weakness.\nI entreat you, brethren, to come to Christ and drink; drink freely\nof the water of salvation. Do not appeal to your own feelings. Do\nnot think that sentimentalism is religion. Shake yourself from every\nhuman prop and lean heavily upon Christ. You need a new fitting up\nbefore you are prepared to engage in the work of saving souls. Your\nwords, your actions, have an influence upon others, and you must\nmeet that influence in the day of God. Jesus says: \u201cBehold, I have\nset before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.\u201d Revelation\n3:8. Light is shining from that door, and it is our privilege to receive\nit if we will. Let us direct our eyes within that open door and try to\nreceive all that Christ is willing to bestow.\nEach one will have a close struggle to overcome sin in his own\nheart. This is at times a very painful and discouraging work; be-\ncause, as we see the deformities in our character, we keep looking\nat them, when we should look to Jesus and put on the robe of His\nrighteousness. Everyone who enters the pearly gates of the city of[183]\nGod will enter there as a conqueror, and his greatest conquest will\nhave been the conquest of self.\nUnity Among Different Nationalities 157\n\u201cFor this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus\nChrist, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,\nthat He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to\nbe strengthened with might by His Spirit in the inner man; that\nChrist may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and\ngrounded in love, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is\nthe breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love\nof Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all\nthe fullness of God.\u201d Ephesians 3:14-19.\nAs workers together for God, brethren and sisters, lean heavily\nupon the arm of the Mighty One. Labor for unity, labor for love, and\nyou will become a power in the world.\nChapter 19\u2014Unity in Christ Jesus[184]\nLoma Linda, California,\nAugust 24, 1905\nTo Our Brethren Connected With the Publishing Work at Col-\nlege View\u2014\nWhile attending the council meeting of the General Conference\nCommittee, held in September, 1904, my mind was deeply exercised\nregarding the unity that should attend our work. I was not able to\nattend all the meetings, but in the night season scene after scene\npassed before me, and I felt that I had a message to bear to our\npeople in many places.\nMy heart is pained as I see that, with such wonderful incentives\nto bring our powers and capabilities to the very highest state of\ndevelopment, we are content to be dwarfs in the work of Christ.\nGod\u2019s desire is that all His workers shall grow to the full stature of\nmen and women in Christ. Where there is vitality, there is growth;\nthe growth testifies to the vitality. The words and works bear living\ntestimony to the world of what Christianity does for the followers of\nChrist.\nWhen you do your appointed work without contention or crit-\nicism of others, a freedom, a light, and a power will attend it that\nwill give character and influence to the institutions and enterprises\nwith which you are connected.\nRemember that you are never on vantage ground when you are\nruffled and when you carry the burden of setting right every soul who\ncomes near you. If you yield to the temptation to criticize others, to\npoint out their faults, to tear down what they are doing, you may be\nsure that you will fail to act your own part nobly and well.\nThis is a time when every man in a responsible position, and[185]\nevery member of the church, should bring every feature of his work\ninto close accord with the teachings of the word of God. By untiring\nvigilance, by fervent prayer, by Christlike words and deeds, we are\nto show the world what God desires His church to be.\n158\nUnity in Christ Jesus 159\nFrom His high position, Christ, the King of glory, the Majesty of\nheaven, saw the condition of men. He pitied human beings in their\nweakness and sinfulness, and came to this earth to reveal what God\nis to men. Leaving the royal courts, and clothing His divinity with\nhumanity, He came to the world Himself, in our behalf to work out\na perfect character. He did not choose His dwelling among the rich\nof the earth. He was born in poverty, of lowly parentage, and lived\nin the despised village of Nazareth. As soon as He was old enough\nto handle tools, He shared the burden of caring for the family.\nChrist humbled Himself to stand at the head of humanity, to meet\nthe temptations and endure the trials that humanity must meet and\nendure. He must know what humanity has to meet from the fallen\nfoe, that He might know how to succor those who are tempted.\nAnd Christ has been made our Judge. The Father is not the Judge.\nThe angels are not. He who took humanity upon Himself, and in this\nworld lived a perfect life, is to judge us. He only can be our Judge.\nWill you remember this, brethren? Will you remember it, ministers?\nWill you remember it, fathers and mothers? Christ took humanity\nthat He might be our Judge. No one of you has been appointed to be\na judge of others. It is all that you can do to discipline yourselves. In\nthe name of Christ I entreat you to heed the injunction that He gives [186]\nyou never to place yourselves on the judgment seat. From day to\nday this message has been sounded in my ears: \u201cCome down from\nthe judgment seat. Come down in humility.\u201d\nNever was there a time when it was more important that we\nshould deny ourselves and take up the cross daily than now. How\nmuch self-denial are we willing to practice?\nA Life of Grace and Peace\nIn the first chapter of the second epistle of Peter you will find the\npromise that grace and peace will be multiplied unto you, if you will\n\u201cadd to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge\ntemperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;\nand to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness char-\nity.\u2019 2 Peter 1:5-7. These virtues are wonderful treasures. They\n\u201cmake a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the\ngolden wedge of Ophir.\u201d Isaiah 13:12.\n160 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\n\u201cIf these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye\nshall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord\nJesus Christ.\u201d 2 Peter 1:8.\nShall we not strive to use to the very best of our ability the little\ntime that is left us in this life, adding grace to grace, power to power,\nmaking it manifest that we have a source of power in the heavens\nabove? Christ says: \u201cAll power is given unto Me in heaven and in\nearth.\u201d Matthew 28:18. What is this power given to Him for? For us.\nHe desires us to realize that He has returned to heaven as our Elder\nBrother and that the measureless power given Him has been placed\nat our disposal.\nThose who will carry out in their lives the instruction given to[187]\nthe church through the apostle Peter will receive power from above.\nWe are to live upon the plan of addition, giving all diligence to make\nour calling and election sure. We are to represent Christ in all that\nwe say and do. We are to live His life. The principles by which\nHe was guided are to shape our course of action toward those with\nwhom we are associated.\nWhen we are securely anchored in Christ, we have a power that\nno human being can take from us. Why is this? Because we are\npartakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is\nin the world through lust, partakers of the nature of Him who came\nto this earth clothed with the habiliments of humanity, that He might\nstand at the head of the human race and develop a character that was\nwithout spot or stain of sin.\nWhy are many of us so weak and inefficient? It is because\nwe look to self, studying our own temperaments and wondering\nhow we can make a place for ourselves, our individuality, and our\npeculiarities, in the place of studying Christ and His character.\nBrethren who could work together in harmony if they would\nlearn of Christ, forgetting that they are Americans or Europeans,\nGermans or Frenchmen, Swedes, Danes, or Norwegians, seem to feel\nthat if they should blend with those of other nationalities, something\nof that which is peculiar to their own country and nation would be\nlost and something else would take its place.\nMy brethren, let us put all this aside. We have no right to keep\nour minds stayed on ourselves, our preferences, and our fancies.\nWe are not to seek to maintain a peculiar identity of our own, a\nUnity in Christ Jesus 161\npersonality, an individuality, which will separate us from our fellow\nlaborers. We have a character to maintain, but it is the character of [188]\nChrist. Having the character of Christ, we can carry on the work of\nGod together. The Christ in us will meet the Christ in our brethren,\nand the Holy Spirit will give that union of heart and action which\ntestifies to the world that we are children of God. May the Lord\nhelp us to die to self and be born again, that Christ may live in us, a\nliving, active principle, a power that will keep us holy.\n* * * * *\nStrive earnestly for unity. Pray for it, work for it. It will bring\nspiritual health, elevation of thought, nobility of character, heav-\nenly-mindedness, enabling you to overcome selfishness and evil\nsurmisings, and to be more than conquerors through Him that loved\nyou and gave Himself for you. Crucify self; esteem others better\nthan yourselves. Thus you will be brought into oneness with Christ.\nBefore the heavenly universe, and before the church and the world,\nyou will bear unmistakable evidence that you are God\u2019s sons and\ndaughters. God will be glorified in the example that you set.\nThe world needs to see worked out before it the miracle that\nbinds the hearts of God\u2019s people together in Christian love. It needs\nto see the Lord\u2019s people sitting together in heavenly places in Christ.\nWill you not give in your lives an evidence of what the truth of God\ncan do for those who love and serve Him? God knows what you\ncan be. He knows what divine grace can do for you if you will be\npartakers of the divine nature.\nChapter 20\u2014The Publishing Work at College View[189]\nLoma Linda, California,\nAugust 24, 1905\nI approve of the efforts that have been made to establish our\nGerman and Scandinavian publishing work at College View. I hope\nthat plans will be devised for the encouragement and strengthening\nof this work.\nThe whole burden of the work must not be left with our foreign\nbrethren. Nor should our brethren throughout the field leave too\nheavy a load on the conferences near College View. The members of\nthese conferences should lead out and do their best, and all should\ncome to their assistance. The truth is to be proclaimed to all nations\nand kindreds and tongues and peoples.\nOur German and Danish and Swedish brethren have no good\nreason for not being able to act in harmony in the publishing work.\nThose who believe the truth should remember that they are God\u2019s\nlittle children, that they are under His training. Let them be thankful\nto God for His manifold mercies and be kind to one another. They\nhave one God and one Saviour; and one Spirit\u2014the Spirit of Christ\u2014\nis to bring unity into their ranks.\nAfter His resurrection, Christ ascended to heaven, and He is\ntoday presenting our needs to the Father. \u201cI have graven thee upon\nthe palms of My hands,\u201d He says. Isaiah 49:16. It cost something\nto engrave them there. It cost untold agony. If we would humble\nourselves before God, and be kind and courteous and tenderhearted\nand pitiful, there would be one hundred conversions to the truth\nwhere now there is only one. But, though professing to be converted,\nwe carry around with us a bundle of self that we regard as altogether\ntoo precious to be given up. It is our privilege to lay this burden at\nthe feet of Christ and in its place take the character and similitude of[190]\nChrist. The Saviour is waiting for us to do this.\nChrist laid aside His royal robe, His kingly crown, and His high\ncommand, and stepped down, down, down, to the lowest depths of\n162\nPublishing Work at College View 163\nhumiliation. Bearing human nature, He met all the temptations of\nhumanity and in our behalf defeated the enemy on every point.\nAll this He did that He might bring men power by which they\nmight be overcomers. \u201cAll power,\u201d He says, \u201cis given unto Me.\u201d\nMatthew 28:18. And this He gives to all who will follow Him. They\nmay demonstrate to the world the power that there is in the religion\nof Christ for the conquest of self.\n\u201cLearn of Me,\u201d Christ says, \u201cand ye shall find rest unto your\nsouls.\u201d Matthew 11:29. Why do we not learn of the Saviour every\nday? Why do we not live in constant communion with Him, so that\nin our connection with one another we can speak and act kindly\nand courteously? Why do we not honor the Lord by manifesting\ntenderness and love for one another? If we speak and act in harmony\nwith the principles of heaven, unbelievers will be drawn to Christ by\ntheir association with us.\nChrist\u2019s Relation to Nationality\nChrist recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed.\nThe scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and a national\nbenefit of all the gifts of heaven and to exclude the rest of God\u2019s\nfamily in the world. But Christ came to break down every wall of\npartition. He came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as\nunconfined as the air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh\nthe earth.\nThe life of Christ established a religion in which there is no caste, [191]\na religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are linked in\na common brotherhood, equal before God. No question of policy\ninfluenced His movements. He made no difference between neigh-\nbors and strangers, friends and enemies. That which appealed to His\nheart was a soul thirsting for the waters of life.\nHe passed no human being by as worthless, but sought to apply\nthe healing remedy to every soul. In whatever company He found\nHimself, He presented a lesson appropriate to the time and the\ncircumstances. Every neglect or insult shown by men to their fellow\nmen only made Him more conscious of their need of His divine-\nhuman sympathy. He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and\nmost unpromising, setting before them the assurance that they might\n164 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nbecome blameless and harmless, attaining such a character as would\nmake them the children of God.\nA Sure Foundation\n\u201cWherefore the rather, brethren,\u201d says the apostle Peter, \u201cgive\ndiligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these\nthings, ye shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered\nunto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and\nSaviour Jesus Christ.\u201d 2 Peter 1:10, 11.\nYears ago, when the company of believers in the soon coming of\nChrist was very small, the Sabbathkeepers at Topsham, Maine, met\nfor worship in the large kitchen in the home of Brother Stockbridge\nHowland. One Sabbath morning Brother Howland was absent. We\nwere surprised at this, because he was always so punctual. Soon he\ncame in, his face aglow, shining with the glory of God. \u201cBrethren,\u201d[192]\nhe said, \u201cI have found it. I have found that we can pursue a course\nof action regarding which the guarantee of God\u2019s word is: \u2018Ye shall\nnever fall.\u2019 I am going to tell you about it.\u201d\nHe then told us that he had noticed that one brother, a poor\nfisherman, had been feeling that he was not as highly respected as he\nought to be and that Brother Howland and others thought themselves\nabove him. This was not true, but it seemed true to him; and for\nseveral weeks he had not attended the meetings. So Brother Howland\nwent to his house and knelt before him, saying: \u201cMy brother, forgive\nme. What is it that I have done?\u201d The man took him by the arm and\ntried to raise him to his feet. \u201cNo,\u201d said Brother Howland, \u201cwhat\nhave you against me?\u201d \u201cI have nothing against you.\u201d \u201cBut you must\nhave,\u201d said Brother Howland, \u201cbecause once we could speak to one\nanother, but now you do not speak to me at all, and I want to know\nwhat is the matter.\u201d\n\u201cGet up, Brother Howland,\u201d he said. \u201cNo,\u201d said Brother How-\nland, \u201cI will not.\u201d \u201cThen I must get down,\u201d he said, and he fell on\nhis knees, and confessed how childish he had been and how many\nevil surmisings he had cherished. \u201cAnd now,\u201d he said, \u201cI will put\nthem all away.\u201d\nPublishing Work at College View 165\nAs Brother Howland told this story, his face shone with the glory\nof the Lord. Just as he had finished, the fisherman and his family\ncame in, and we had an excellent meeting.\nSuppose that some of us should follow the course pursued by\nBrother Howland. If when our brethren surmise evil, we would go\nto them, saying, \u201cForgive me if I have done anything to harm you,\u201d\nwe might break the spell of Satan and set our brethren free from\ntheir temptations. Do not let anything interpose between you and [193]\nyour brethren. If there is anything that you can do by sacrifice to\nclear away the rubbish of suspicion, do it. God wants us to love one\nanother as brethren. He wants us to be pitiful and courteous. He\nwants us to educate ourselves to believe that our brethren love us,\nand to believe that Christ loves us. Love begets love.\nDo we expect to meet our brethren in heaven? If we can live\nwith them here in peace and harmony we could live with them there.\nBut how could we live with them in heaven if we cannot live with\nthem here without continued contention and strife? Those who are\nfollowing a course of action that separates them from their brethren\nand brings in discord and dissension, need a thorough conversion.\nOur hearts must be melted and subdued by the love of Christ. We\nmust cherish the love that He showed in dying for us on the cross\nof Calvary. We need to draw closer and closer to the Saviour. We\nshould be much in prayer, and we must learn to exercise faith. We\nmust be more tenderhearted, more pitiful and courteous. We shall\npass through this world but once. Shall we not strive to leave on\nthose with whom we associate the impress of the character of Christ?\nOur hard hearts need to be broken. We need to come together in\nperfect unity, and we need to realize that we are the purchase of the\nblood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Let each one say: \u201cHe gave His\nlife for me, and He wants me, as I go through this world, to reveal\nthe love that He revealed in giving Himself for me.\u201d Christ bore our\nsins in His own body on the cross, that God might be just and yet\nthe justifier of those who believe in Him. There is life, eternal life,\nfor all who will surrender to Christ.\nI want to see the King in His beauty. I want to behold His [194]\nmatchless charms. I want you to behold Him, too. Christ will\nlead His redeemed ones beside the river of life and will explain to\nthem all that perplexed them in this world. The mysteries of grace\n166 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwill unfold before them. Where their finite minds discerned only\nconfusion and broken purposes, they will see the most perfect and\nbeautiful harmony.\nLet us serve God with all our capabilities, with all our intelli-\ngence. Our intelligence will increase as we make use of that which\nwe have. Our religious experience will strengthen as we bring it into\nthe daily life. Thus we shall climb round after round of the ladder\nreaching to heaven, until at last we step from off the topmost round\ninto the kingdom of God. Let us be Christians in this world. Then\nwe shall have eternal life in the kingdom of glory.\n* * * * *\nUnity existing among the followers of Christ is an evidence\nthat the Father has sent His Son to save sinners. It is a witness to\nHis power; for nothing short of the miraculous power of God can\nbring human beings with their different temperaments together in\nharmonious action, their one aim being to speak the truth in love.\nGod\u2019s warnings and counsels are plain and decided. As we read\nthe Scriptures and see the power for good that there is in unity and\nthe power for evil that there is in disunion, how can we fail to receive\nthe word of God into our hearts? Suspicion and distrust are as evil\nleaven. Unity bears witness to the power of the truth.\nChapter 21\u2014German and Scandinavian [195]\nConferences\nLoma Linda, California,\nSeptember 1, 1905\nDear Brethren,\nSome of our ministers have written to me, asking if the work\namong the Germans and Scandinavians should not be carried forward\nunder separate organizations. This matter has been presented to me\nseveral times. When I was in College View, the Lord gave me a\nstraight testimony to bear, and since that time the matter has been\npresented to me again.\nAt one time I seemed to be in a council meeting where these\nmatters were being considered. One of authority stood in the midst\nof those assembled and opened before them principles that should be\nfollowed in the work of God. The instruction given was that should\nsuch separation take place, it would not tend to advance the interests\nof the work among the various nationalities. It would not lead to the\nhighest spiritual development. Walls would be built up that would\nhave to be removed in the near future.\nAccording to the light given me of God, separate organizations,\ninstead of bringing about unity, will create discord. If our brethren\nwill seek the Lord together in humility of mind, those who now\nthink it necessary to organize separate German and Scandinavian\nconferences will see that the Lord desires them to work together as\nbrethren.\nWere those who seek to disintegrate the work of God, to carry\nout their purpose, some would magnify themselves to do a work\nthat should not be done. Such an arrangement would greatly retard\nthe cause of God. If we are to carry on the work most successfully,\nthe talents to be found among the English and Americans should be [196]\nunited with the talents of those of every other nationality. And each\nnationality should labor earnestly for every other nationality. There\n167\n168 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nis but one Lord, one faith. Our effort should be to answer Christ\u2019s\nprayer for His disciples, that they should be one.\n\u201cSanctify them through Thy truth: Thy word is truth. As Thou\nhast sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the\nworld. And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be\nsanctified through the truth.\n\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall\nbelieve on Me through their word; that they all may be one; as Thou,\nFather, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us:\nthat the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\u201d John 17:17-21.\nIt should be understood that perfect unity among the laborers\nis necessary to the successful accomplishment of the work of God.\nIn order to preserve peace, all must seek wisdom from the Great\nTeacher. Let all be careful how they introduce ambitious propositions\nthat will create dissension.\nWe are to be subject one to another. No man, in himself, is a\ncomplete whole. Through submission of the mind and will to the\nHoly Spirit we are ever to be learners of the Great Teacher.\nStudy the second chapter of Acts. In the early church the Spirit\nof God wrought mightily through those who were harmoniously\nunited. On the Day of Pentecost they were all with one accord in\none place.\nWe are to demonstrate to the world that men of every nationality\nare one in Christ Jesus. Then let us remove every barrier and come\ninto unity in the service of the Master.\nIn the erection of national barriers you present to the world a[197]\nplan of human invention that God can never endorse. To those who\nwould do this, the apostle Paul says: \u201cYe are yet carnal: for whereas\nthere is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not\ncarnal? ... Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers\nby whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have\nplanted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither\nis he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that\ngiveth the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are\none: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his\nown labor. For we are laborers together with God: ye are God\u2019s\nhusbandry, ye are God\u2019s building.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:3-9.\nGerman and Scandinavian Conferences 169\nAn Example of Brotherly Kindness\nWhen our brethren in Scandinavia faced a financial crisis, the\ntestimony was given that we must not permit our brethren to stand\nas bankrupt before the world. That would have been dishonoring to\nGod. And the prompt and liberal action of our American brethren\nwas an acknowledgment that the difference in nationality could not\nrelease them from their duty to assist one another in the work of\nGod. \u201cAll ye are brethren.\u201d Matthew 23:8. We are one in the unity\nof the truth.\nWe must now, by diligent, self-sacrificing effort, endeavor to\nwalk in the love of Christ, in the unity of the Spirit, through sanc-\ntification of the truth. No halfway work will suffice to fulfill the\nrepresentation given in the prayer of Christ. We are to practice\nthe principles of heaven here below. In heaven there is one grand\nmeeting place.\nI must write plainly regarding the building up of partition walls [198]\nin the work of God. Such an action has been revealed to me as a\nfallacy of human invention. It is not the Lord\u2019s plan for His people to\nseparate themselves into separate companies, because of differences\nin nationality and language. Did they do this, their ideas would\nbecome narrow, and their influence would be greatly lessened. God\ncalls for a harmonious blending of a variety of talents.\nI again repeat the words of Christ. I would impress them deeply\nupon your minds. \u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also\nwhich shall believe on Me through their word; that they all may be\none; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may\nbe one in Us: that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.\nAnd the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they\nmay be one, even as We are one: I in them, and Thou in Me, that\nthey may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that\nThou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as Thou hast loved Me.\u201d\nChrist has hedged in His people from the world, but those who\nwould build up national separation, would do a work for which the\nLord Jesus Christ has given no encouragement.\nBrethren, unify; draw close together, laying aside every human\ninvention and following closely in the footsteps of Jesus, your great\nExample.\n170 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nSection 6\u2014Among the Colored People [199]\n\u201cPray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth\nlaborers into His harvest. \u201d Matthew 9:38.\nChapter 22\u2014A Call for Colored Laborers\nMost decided efforts should be made to educate and train colored\nmen and women to labor as missionaries in the Southern States of\nAmerica. Christian colored students should be preparing to give the\ntruth to their own race. Those who make the fear of the Lord the\nbeginning of their wisdom and give heed to the counsel of men of\nexperience can be a great blessing to the Negro race by carrying to\ntheir own people the light of present truth. Every worker laboring in\nhumility and in harmony with his brethren will be a channel of light\nto many who are now in the darkness of ignorance and superstition.\nInstead of wondering whether they are not fitted to labor for white\npeople, let our colored brethren and sisters devote themselves to\nmissionary work among the colored people. There is an abundance\nof room for intelligent colored men and women to labor for their own\npeople. Much work remains to be done in the Southern field. Special\nefforts are to be made in the large cities. In each of these cities there\nare thousands of colored people, to whom the last warning message\nof mercy must be given. Let the missionary spirit be awakened in\nthe hearts of our colored church members. Let earnest work be done\nfor those who know not the truth.\nTo every colored brother and sister I would say: Look at the[200]\nsituation as it is. Ask yourself: \u201cIn view of the opportunities and\nadvantages granted me, how much do I owe to my Lord? How can\nI best glorify Him and promote the interests of my people? How\ncan I use to the best advantage the knowledge God has been pleased\nto give me? Should I not open my Bible and teach the truth to my\npeople? Are there not thousands perishing for lack of knowledge,\nwhom I can help if I submit myself to God so that He can use me\nas His instrument? Have I not a work to do for my oppressed,\ndiscouraged fellows?\u201d\nThe Southern field is suffering for workers. Will you pass by\nyour people, making no effort to help them, or will you with a\nhumble heart work to save the perishing? There is a work you can\n172\nCall for Colored Laborers 173\ndo if you will humble yourself before God. Trusting in Him, you\nwill find peace and comfort, but following your own way and your\nown will, you will find thorns and thistles, and you will lose the\nreward.\nTime is short, and what you do must be done quickly. Resolve to\nredeem the time. Seek not your own pleasure. Rouse yourself! Take\nhold of the work with a new purpose of heart. The Lord will open\nthe way before you. Make every possible effort to work in Christ\u2019s\nlines, in meekness and lowliness, relying upon Him for strength.\nUnderstand the work the Lord gives you to do, and, trusting in God,\nyou will be enabled to go on from strength to strength, from grace\nto grace. You will be enabled to work diligently, perseveringly, for\nyour people while the day lasts; for the night cometh in which no\nman shall work.\nThere is the greatest need for all kinds of missionary work in the\nSouth. Without delay, workers must be prepared for this field. Our [201]\npeople should provide a fund for the education of men and women\nin the Southern States who, being accustomed to the climate, can\nwork there without endangering their health.\nPromising young men and young women should be educated\nto become teachers. They should have the very best advantages.\nSchoolhouses and meetinghouses should be built in different places,\nand teachers employed.\nThose who for years have been working to help the colored\npeople are well fitted to give counsel in regard to the opening of\nsuch schools. So far as possible these schools should be established\noutside the cities. But in the cities there are many children who\ncould not attend schools away from the cities; and for the benefit\nof these, schools should be opened in the cities as well as in the\ncountry.\nThe children and youth in these schools are to be taught some-\nthing more than merely how to read. Industrial lines of work are to\nbe carried forward. The students are to be provided with facilities\nfor learning trades that will enable them to support themselves.\nOur churches in the North, as well as in the South, should do what\nthey can to help support the school work for the colored children.\nThe schools already established should be faithfully maintained. The\nestablishment of new schools will require additional funds. Let all\n174 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nour brethren and sisters do their part wholeheartedly to place these\nschools on vantage ground.\nIn addition to engaging in this line of school work, our col-\nored brethren may do a good work by establishing mission Sunday\nschools and Sabbath schools among their own people\u2014schools in\nwhich the youth may be taught by teachers whose hearts are filled\nwith love for souls.\nOpportunities are continually presenting themselves in the South-[202]\nern States, and many wise, Christian colored men will be called to\nthe work. But for several reasons white men must be chosen as\nleaders. We are all members of one body and are complete only\nin Christ Jesus, who will uplift His people from the low level to\nwhich sin has degraded them and will place them where they shall\nbe acknowledged in the heavenly courts as laborers together with\nGod.\nThere is work to be done in many hard places, and out of these\nhard places bright laborers are to come. Let the work be managed\nso that colored laborers will be educated to work for their own race.\nAmong the Negro race there are many who have talent and ability.\nLet us search out these men and women, and teach them how to\nengage in the work of saving souls. God will co-operate with them\nand give them the victory.\n\u201cLaborers Together With God\u201d\nThe ear of the Lord is open to the cries of those who are in His\nservice. He has promised: \u201cI will guide thee with Mine eye.\u201d Psalm\n32:8. Walk humbly with God, and ask Him to make your course of\nduty plain. When He speaks to His representatives and asks them to\nbe laborers together with Him, they will do the same kind of work\nthat Jesus announced as His work when He stood up to read in the\nsynagogue at Nazareth. He opened the book of the prophet Esaias\nand read: \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me; because the Lord\nhath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the meek; He hath sent\nMe to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,\nand the opening of the prison to them that are bound.\u201d Isaiah 61:1.\nThe truth is now overcast in the world by clouds of error that[203]\nprevail. He who can influence even the most lowly, and can win\nCall for Colored Laborers 175\nthem to Christ, is co-operating with divine agencies in seeking to\nsave that which is lost. In presenting to the sinner a personal, sin-\npardoning Saviour, we reach a hand of sympathy and Christlike love\nto grasp the hand of one fallen, and, laying hold of the hand of Christ\nby faith, we form a link of union between the sinner and the Saviour.\nThe end is near, and every soul is now to walk carefully, humbly,\nmeekly with Christ Jesus. Our precious Saviour, from whom all\nthe rays of truth radiate to the world, wants us to put not our trust\nin princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help; but to\nlean wholly upon Him. He says: \u201cWithout Me ye can do nothing.\u201d\nJohn 15:5. We need to look to Jesus constantly in order that He may\nimpress upon us His own lovely image. We are to behold the Lamb\nof God, which taketh away the sin of the world. Then we shall reveal\nChrist to our fellow men.\nChapter 23\u2014Proclaiming the Truth Where There is[204]\nRace Antagonism\nI am burdened, heavily burdened, for the work among the colored\npeople. The gospel is to be presented to the downtrodden Negro\nrace. But great caution will have to be shown in the efforts put forth\nfor the uplifting of this people. Among the white people in many\nplaces there exists a strong prejudice against the Negro race. We\nmay desire to ignore this prejudice, but we cannot do it. If we were\nto act as if this prejudice did not exist we could not get the light\nbefore the white people. We must meet the situation as it is and deal\nwith it wisely and intelligently.\nFor many years I have borne a heavy burden in behalf of the\nNegro race. My heart has ached as I have seen the feeling against\nthis race growing stronger and still stronger, and as I have seen that\nmany Seventh-day Adventists are apparently unable to understand\nthe necessity for an earnest work being done quickly. Years are\npassing into eternity with apparently little done to help those who\nwere recently a race of slaves.\nOne of the difficulties attending the work is that many of the\nwhite people living where the colored people are numerous are not\nwilling that special efforts should be put forth to uplift them. When\nthey see schools established for them, when they see them being\ntaught to be self-supporting, to follow trades, to provide themselves\nwith comfortable homes instead of continuing to live in hovels, they\nsee the possibility that selfish plans will be interfered with\u2014that\nthey will no longer be able to hire the Negro for a mere pittance;\nand their enmity is aroused. They feel that they are injured and\nabused. Some act as if slavery had never been abolished. This spirit[205]\nis growing stronger as the Spirit of God is being withdrawn from\nthe world, and in many places it is impossible now to do that work\nwhich could have been done for the colored people in past years.\nMuch might have been accomplished by the people of America\nif adequate efforts in behalf of the freedmen had been put forth by\n176\nProclaiming the Truth 177\nthe Government and by the Christian churches immediately after the\nemancipation of the slaves. Money should have been used freely to\ncare for and educate them at the time they were so greatly in need\nof help. But the Government, after a little effort, left the Negro to\nstruggle, unaided, with his burden of difficulties. Some of the strong\nChristian churches began a good work, but sadly failed to reach more\nthan a comparatively few; and the Seventh-day Adventist Church\nhas failed to act its part. Some persevering efforts have been put\nforth by individuals and by societies to uplift the colored people,\nand a noble work has been done. But how few have had a part in\nthis work which should have had the sympathy and help of all!\nNoble efforts have been put forth by some Seventh-day Adven-\ntists to do the work that needed to be done for the colored people.\nHad those who were engaged in this work received the co-operation\nof all their ministering brethren, the result of their work would now\nbe altogether different from what it is. But the great majority of\nour ministers did not co-operate, as they should have done, with the\nfew who were struggling to carry forward a much-needed work in a\ndifficult field.\nAs time advances, and opposition strengthens, circumstances\nwarn us that discretion is the better part of valor. If unwise moves\nhave been made in the work done for the colored people, it is not [206]\nbecause warnings have not been given. From Australia, across the\nbroad waters of the Pacific, cautions were sent that every move-\nment must be guarded, that the workers were to make no political\nspeeches, and that the mingling of whites and blacks in social equal-\nity was by no means to be encouraged.\nIn a council meeting held in 1895 at Armadale, a suburb of\nMelbourne, Victoria, I spoke of these matters, in answer to the\ninquiries of my brethren, and urged the necessity of caution. I said\nthat perilous times were coming, and that the sentiments that could\nthen be expressed in regard to what should be done along missionary\nlines for the colored people could not be expressed in the future\nwithout imperiling lives. I said plainly that the work done for the\ncolored people would have to be carried on along lines different\nfrom those followed in some sections of the country in former years.\nLet as little as possible be said about the color line, and let the\ncolored people work chiefly for those of their own race.\n178 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nIn regard to white and colored people worshiping in the same\nbuilding, this cannot be followed as a general custom with profit\nto either party\u2014especially in the South. The best thing will be to\nprovide the colored people who accept the truth, with places of\nworship of their own, in which they can carry on their services by\nthemselves. This is particularly necessary in the South in order that\nthe work for the white people may be carried on without serious\nhindrance.\nLet the colored believers be provided with neat, tasteful houses\nof worship. Let them be shown that this is done not to exclude them\nfrom worshiping with white people, because they are black, but\nin order that the progress of the truth may be advanced. Let them[207]\nunderstand that this plan is to be followed until the Lord shows us a\nbetter way.\nThe colored members of ability and experience should be en-\ncouraged to lead the services of their own people; and their voices\nare to be heard in the representative assemblies.\nAmong the colored believers there are many who can labor to\nadvantage for their own people\u2014workers to whom the Lord has\ngiven light and knowledge and who possess capabilities of no mean\norder. These are to labor perseveringly and in every effective way.\nThey are to use our literature and hold tent meetings and meetings\nin halls. And sometimes (where it is permissible) white ministers\nshould help them. Special efforts should be made to increase the\nforce of colored workers. Colored men are to be thoroughly educated\nand trained to give Bible readings and hold tent meetings among\ntheir own people. There are many having capability, who should be\nprepared for this work.\nWe should be deeply interested in the establishment of schools\nfor the colored people. And we must not overlook the importance\nof placing the present truth before the teachers and students in the\nlarge colleges for colored people that have been established by men\nof the world.\nSchools and sanitariums for colored people should be estab-\nlished, and in these the colored youth should be taught and trained\nfor service by the very best teachers that can be employed.\nThe colored ministers should make every effort possible to help\ntheir own people to understand the truth for this time. As time\nProclaiming the Truth 179\nadvances, and race prejudices increase, it will become almost im-\npossible, in many places, for white workers to labor for the colored [208]\npeople. Sometimes the white people who are not in sympathy with\nour work will unite with colored people to oppose it, claiming that\nour teaching is an effort to break up churches and bring in trouble\nover the Sabbath question. White ministers and colored ministers\nwill make false statements, arousing in the minds of the people such\na feeling of antagonism that they will be ready to destroy and to kill.\nThe powers of hell are working with all their ingenuity to prevent\nthe proclamation of the last message of mercy among the colored\npeople. Satan is working to make it most difficult for the gospel\nminister and teacher to ignore the prejudice that exists between the\nwhite and the colored people.\nLet us follow the course of wisdom. Let us do nothing that\nwill unnecessarily arouse opposition\u2014nothing that will hinder the\nproclamation of the gospel message. Where demanded by custom or\nwhere greater efficiency is to be gained, let the white believers and\nthe colored believers assemble in separate places of worship. Let\nus cultivate the meekness of Christ. He was the Majesty of heaven,\nthe only-begotten Son of God. Yet \u201cGod so loved the world, that\nHe gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him\nshould not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16.\nIf, to save a perishing world, God condescended to give up\nHis Son to a painful, ignominious death, should not the Lord\u2019s\nmissionaries be willing to make every effort in their power to win\nand help those who are in the depths of sin, and to flash the light\nupon those who are in darkness as to what is truth? Christ clothed\nHis divinity with humanity, that He might reach down and uplift [209]\nfallen human beings. Shall not His followers, for His sake, be willing\nto submit to many things unjust and grievous to be borne, in order\nto help the very ones who need help? Let the work be done in a way\nthat will not arouse prejudice which would close doors now open\nfor the entrance of the truth.\nThe men of talent among the colored believers are to be laborers\ntogether with God for their own people. And yet there will some-\ntimes be opportunities for them to bear a testimony in tent meetings\nand in large assemblies, which will reach many, many souls. These\nopportunities will appear as the Southern field is worked and the\n180 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nloud cry is given. When the Holy Spirit is poured out, there will\nbe a triumph of humanity over prejudice in seeking the salvation of\nthe souls of human beings. God will control minds. Human hearts\nwill love as Christ loved. And the color line will be regarded by\nmany very differently from the way in which it is now regarded. To\nlove as Christ loves, lifts the mind into a pure, heavenly, unselfish\natmosphere.\nHe who is closely connected with Christ is lifted above the\nprejudice of color or caste. His faith takes hold of eternal realities.\nThe divine Author of truth is to be uplifted. Our hearts are to be\nfilled with the faith that works by love and purifies the soul. The\nwork of the good Samaritan is the example that we are to follow.\nWe are not to agitate the color line question, and thus arouse\nprejudice and bring about a crisis. The light of the third angel\u2019s\nmessage is to be given to those who need light. We are to labor\ncalmly, quietly, faithfully, trusting in our Elder Brother. We are\nnot to be in haste to define the exact course to be pursued in the\nfuture regarding the relation to be maintained between white and\ncolored people. The truth for this time is to be proclaimed before[210]\nthe thousands of people in the Southern States. The way is to be\ncleared, as far as possible, of all obstruction. Let the gospel message\nbe given to the people. Let white and colored people be labored for\nin separate, distinct lines, and let the Lord take care of the rest. The\ntruth must come before the white men and women of the Southern\nStates. Then there will be a work done in their families that will lead\nto the salvation of many souls.\n\u201cIn All Wisdom and Prudence\u201d\nWhile men are trying to settle the question of the color line, time\nrolls on, and souls go down into the grave, unwarned and unsaved.\nLet this condition of things continue no longer. Let men and women\ngo to work, and let them labor as the Spirit of God shall impress\ntheir minds. We need the talent of the colored believers, every jot\nof it, in this work. Let colored workers labor for their own people,\nassisted by white workers as occasion demands. They will often\nneed counsel and advice. Let the colored believers have their place\nof worship and the white believers their place of worship. Let each\nProclaiming the Truth 181\ncompany be zealous to do genuine missionary work for its own\npeople and for the colored people wherever and whenever they can.\nWhen the truth has been presented in a place, and as many white\npeople as will hear and believe have accepted the truth, opportunities\nwill sometimes appear for efforts to be made, in a quiet, unobtrusive\nmanner, by white laborers for the colored people. Such opportunities\nshould not be overlooked.\nBut we must not unnecessarily arouse prejudice that would close\nthe way against the proclamation of the third angel\u2019s message to the\nwhite people. They need this message; for a time of trouble is before [211]\nus, such as never was since there was a nation.\nGreat care must be exercised that nothing be said or done to\ninflame the feelings of the colored people against the whites. Let us\nnot aggravate the difficulties that already exist. However wisely the\nworkers labor, they will have opposition to meet, without creating\nan agitation over the color line. Let us clear the King\u2019s highway.\nLet God have a chance to work. Let men keep out of His way. He\nwill plan and manage better than human beings possibly can. Let us\nremember that our first great work is to preach the word of God, to\ngive the warnings of the Bible.\nThe Lord calls upon all to take up the work in humility of mind.\nThe ministers are not all sanctified through the truth. The Lord calls\nupon all to lay down their controversies. Let men beware of doing\nthat which would cut off our last hope of entering difficult fields\nwhere there is race prejudice and antagonism.\nAs a means of overcoming prejudice and gaining access to minds,\nmedical missionary work must be done, not in one or two places\nonly, but in many places where the truth has not yet been proclaimed.\nWe are to work as gospel medical missionaries, to heal the sin-sick\nsouls by giving them the message of salvation. This work will break\ndown prejudice as nothing else can.\nThe Sabbath\nThe Sabbath question is one that will demand great care and\nwisdom in its presentation. Much of the grace and power of God\nwill be needed to cast down the idol that has been erected in the\nshape of a false sabbath. Lift up the standard, lift it up, higher and\n182 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nstill higher. Point the people to the twentieth chapter of Exodus,\nin which the law of God is recorded. The first four of the Ten[212]\nCommandments outline our duty to our Maker. He who is false to\nhis God cannot be true to his neighbor. He who loves God supremely\nwill love his neighbor as himself. Pride lifts itself up unto vanity,\nleading the human agent to make a God of himself. The gospel of\nChrist sanctifies the soul, expelling self-love.\n\u201cRemember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.\u201d Exodus 20:8. The\nSabbath was instituted in Eden, after God had created the world.\n\u201cThus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of\nthem. And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had\nmade; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which\nHe had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it:\nbecause that in it He had rested from all His work which God created\nand made.\u201d Genesis 2:1-3.\n\u201cAnd the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak thou also unto\nthe children of Israel, saying, Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for\nit is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye\nmay know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. Ye shall keep\nthe Sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: everyone that defileth\nit shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein,\nthat soul shall be cut off from among his people. Six days may work\nbe done; but in the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to the Lord:\nwhosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put\nto death. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath,\nto observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual\ncovenant.\u201d Exodus 31:12-16.\nOctober 19, 1908.\nChapter 24\u2014The Color Line [213]\nI have some things to say in regard to the colored people of the\nSouthern States of America and the relation that we should sustain\nto them. So long were they under the curse of slavery that it is a\ndifficult problem to know how they should now be treated.\nWhen God\u2019s workers allow His Spirit to work upon their minds,\nmuch will be accomplished in the saving of souls. The Lord is\nour helper. He will guide us in all matters if we will trust in Him.\nOne thing is certain: We must have faith in God\u2014faith that He will\narrange matters in a way that will enable us to work successfully.\nNo one ever trusted God in vain. He will never disappoint those who\nput their trust in Him.\nWe are to avoid entering into contention over the problem of the\ncolor line. If this question is much agitated, difficulties will arise that\nwill consume much precious time to adjust. We cannot lay down a\ndefinite line to be followed in dealing with this subject. In different\nplaces and under varying circumstances, the subject will need to be\nhandled differently. In the South, where race prejudice is so strong,\nwe could do nothing in presenting the truth were we to deal with\nthe color line question as we can deal with it in some places in the\nNorth. The white workers in the South will have to move in a way\nthat will enable them to gain access to the white people.\nIt is Satan\u2019s plan to call minds to the study of the color line. If\nhis suggestions are heeded, there will be diversity of opinion and\ngreat confusion. No one is capable of clearly defining the proper\nposition of the colored people. Men may advance theories, but I\nassure you that it will not do for us to follow human theories. So far\nas possible the color line question should be allowed to rest. [214]\nThe cities of the South are to be worked, and for this work the\nbest talent is to be secured, and that without delay. Let white workers\nlabor for the white people, proclaiming the message of present truth\nin its simplicity. They will find openings through which they may\n183\n184 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nreach the higher class. Every opportunity for reaching this class is\nto be improved.\nLet colored laborers do what they can to keep abreast, working\nearnestly for their own people. I thank God that among the colored\nbelievers there are men of talent who can work efficiently for their\nown people, presenting the truth in clear lines. There are many\ncolored people of precious talent who will be converted to the truth\nif our colored ministers are wise in devising ways of training teachers\nfor the schools and other laborers for the field.\nThe colored people should not urge that they be placed on an\nequality with white people. The relation of the two races has been a\nmatter hard to deal with, and I fear that it will ever remain a most\nperplexing problem. So far as possible, everything that would stir\nup the race prejudice of the white people should be avoided. There\nis danger of closing the door so that our white laborers will not be\nable to work in some places in the South.\nI know that if we attempt to meet the ideas and preferences of\nsome of the colored people, we shall find our way blocked com-\npletely. The work of proclaiming the truth for this time is not to be\nhindered by an effort to adjust the position of the Negro race. Should\nwe attempt to do this we should find that barriers like mountains\nwould be raised to hinder the work that God desires to have done. If\nwe move quietly and judiciously, laboring in the way that God has[215]\nmarked out, both white and colored people will be benefited by our\nlabors.\nThe time has not come for us to work as if there were no preju-\ndice. Christ said: \u201cBe ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless\nas doves.\u201d Matthew 10:16. If you see that by doing certain things\nwhich you have a perfect right to do, you hinder the advancement of\nGod\u2019s work, refrain from doing those things. Do nothing that will\nclose the minds of others against the truth. There is a world to save,\nand we shall gain nothing by cutting loose from those we are trying\nto help. All things may be lawful, but all things are not expedient.\nThe wise course is the best. As laborers together with God, we\nare to work in the way that will enable us to accomplish the most\nfor Him. Let none go to extremes. We need wisdom from above;\nfor we have a difficult problem to solve. If rash moves are made\nnow, great mischief will be done. The matter is to be presented in\nColor Line 185\nsuch a way that the truly converted colored people will cling to the\ntruth for Christ\u2019s sake, refusing to renounce one principle of sound\nBible doctrine because they may think that the very best course is\nnot being pursued toward the Negro race.\nWe must sit as learners at the feet of Christ, that He may teach\nus the will of God and that we may know how to work for the white\npeople and the colored people in the Southern field. We are to do\nas the Spirit of the Lord shall dictate, and agitate the subject of the\ncolor line as little as possible. We must use every energy to present\nthe closing gospel message to all classes in the South. As we are led\nand controlled by the Spirit of God we shall find that this question\nwill adjust itself in the minds of our people.\nLet us individually seek the Lord. Let those whose religious [216]\nexperience in the past has been only a surface work, draw near to\nGod. Repent, repent, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted\nout.\nWhen we are prepared to take hold of the work in earnest we\nshall be better able than we are now to deal with the questions\ninvolved in this work. Let every believer do his best to prepare the\nway for the gospel missionary work that is to be done. But let no\none enter into controversy. It is Satan\u2019s object to keep Christians\noccupied in controversies among themselves. He knows that if they\ndo not watch, the day of the Lord will come on them as a thief in\nthe night. We have no time now to give place to the spirit of the\nenemy and to cherish prejudices that confuse the judgment and lead\nus away from Christ.\nIt will take money and earnest, persevering effort to do that\nwhich needs to be done among the colored people. Every man needs\nnow to stand in his lot and place, confessing and forsaking his sins,\nand working in harmony with his brethren. God\u2019s workers are to be\nof one mind and one heart, praying for the impartation of the Spirit\nand believing that God will fulfill His word.\nA Lesson from Christ\u2019s Labors\nOn one occasion, while Christ was in the midst of His work of\nteaching and healing, one of the company assembled about Him\n186 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nsaid: \u201cMaster, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance\nwith me.\u201d Luke 12:13.\nThis man had witnessed Christ\u2019s wonderful works. He had been\nastonished at the clearness of His comprehension, His superior judg-\nment, and the fairness with which He viewed the cases brought to[217]\nHim. He heard Christ\u2019s stirring appeals and His solemn denuncia-\ntions of the scribes and Pharisees. If words of such command could\nbe spoken to this brother, he would not dare to refuse the aggrieved\nman his portion. He solicited Christ\u2019s influence on his side. \u201cSpeak\nto my brother,\u201d he said, \u201cthat he divide the inheritance with me.\u201d\nThe Holy Spirit was pleading with this man to become an heir\nof the inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled, and that fadeth\nnot away. He had seen evidence of the power of Christ. Now the\nopportunity was his to speak to the Great Teacher, to express the\ndesire uppermost in his heart. But like the man with the muckrake\nin Bunyan\u2019s allegory, his eyes were fixed on the earth. He saw not\nthe crown above his head. Like Simon Magus he valued the gift of\nGod as a means of worldly gain.\nThe Saviour\u2019s mission on earth was fast drawing to a close. Only\na few months remained for Him to complete what He came to do\nin establishing the kingdom of His grace. Yet human greed would\nhave turned Him from His work to take up the dispute over a piece\nof land. But Jesus was not to be diverted from His mission. His\nanswer was: \u201cMan, who made Me a judge or a divider over you?\u201d\nLuke 12:14.\nChrist gave the man plainly to understand that this was not His\nwork. He was striving to save souls. He was not to be turned aside\nfrom this to take up the duties of a civil magistrate.\nHow often today labor is forced upon the church that should\nnever be allowed to enter the work of the gospel ministry!\nAgain and again Christ had been asked to decide legal and polit-[218]\nical questions. But He refused to interfere in temporal matters. He\nknew that in the political world there were iniquitous proceedings\nand great tyranny. But His only exposure of these was the proclama-\ntion of Bible truth. To the great multitudes that thronged His steps\nHe presented the pure, holy principles of the law of God and spoke\nof the blessing found in obeying these principles. With authority\nColor Line 187\nfrom on high He enforced the importance of justice and mercy. But\nHe refused to become entangled in personal disputes.\nChrist stood in our world as the Head of the great spiritual king-\ndom that He came to our world to establish\u2014the kingdom of righ-\nteousness. His teaching made plain the ennobling, sanctifying prin-\nciples that govern this kingdom. He showed that justice and mercy\nand love are the controlling powers in Jehovah\u2019s kingdom.\nA Time of Preparation\nWe are living in the great antitypical day of atonement. We\nmust individually seek God. This is a personal work. Let us draw\nnear to God, allowing nothing to come into our efforts that would\nmisrepresent the truth for this time. Let everyone confess, not his\nbrother\u2019s sin, but his own sin. Let him humble his heart before God\nand become so filled with the Holy Spirit that his life will show that\nhe has been born again. We read: \u201cAs many as received Him, to\nthem gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that\nbelieve on His name.\u201d John 1:12.\nThe gospel of Christ is to be lived, practiced in the daily life. The\nservants of God are to be cleansed from all coldness, all selfishness.\nSimplicity, meekness, lowliness are of great value in the work of [219]\nGod. Try to unite the workers in confidence and love. If you cannot\ndo this, be right yourselves, and leave the rest with God. Labor\nin faith and prayer. Select Christian youth, and train them to be,\nnot workers with hearts like iron, but workers who are willing to\nharmonize.\nI pray that the Lord will change the hearts of those who, unless\nthey receive more grace, will enter into temptation. I pray that\nHe will soften and subdue every heart. We need to live in close\nfellowship with God, that we may love one another as Christ has\nloved us. It is by this that the world is to know that we are His\ndisciples. Let there be no self-exaltation. If the workers will humble\ntheir hearts before God, the blessing will come. They will all the\nwhile be receiving fresh, new ideas, and there will be a wonderful\nrevival of gospel medical missionary work.\nThe great work before us all, as Christians, is to extend Christ\u2019s\nkingdom as rapidly as possible, in accordance with the divine com-\n188 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nmission. The gospel is to advance from conquest to conquest, from\nvictory to victory. The greatness of the kingdom under the whole\nheaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High,\nand they shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever\nand ever.\nThe Warfare Before Us\nGod\u2019s servants are to put on every piece of the Christian armor.\nWe are not wrestling simply with human foes. God calls upon\nevery Christian to enter the warfare and fight under His leadership,\ndepending for success on the grace and help of Heaven.\nWe are to go forward in the strength of the Mighty One. Never[220]\nare we to yield to Satan\u2019s attacks. Why should not we, as Christian\nwarriors, stand against principalities and powers, and against the\nrulers of the darkness of this world? God calls upon us to press\nforward, using the gifts entrusted to us. Satan will place temptation\nbefore us. He will try to overcome us by stratagem. But in the\nstrength of God we are to stand firm as a rock to principle.\nIn this warfare there is no release. Satan\u2019s agents never pause in\ntheir work of destruction. Those who are in Christ\u2019s service must\nwatch every outpost. Our object is to save perishing souls from ruin.\nThis is a work of infinite greatness, and man cannot hope to obtain\nsuccess in it unless he unites with the divine Worker.\nFrom eternity Christ has been man\u2019s Redeemer. Ever since the\nFall there has come to those uniting with Him in His great work the\nword: \u201cBe not weary in well-doing.\u201d 2 Thessalonians 3:13. Be ye\nsteadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 15:58.\nThe Christian is encouraged to show patient perseverance in\ncarrying forward the work of the gospel ministry in connection with\nthe medical missionary work. As he gains an experience in genuine\nreligion, he obtains a spiritual knowledge that makes character.\nThe life of a true Christian is one continuous round of service.\n\u201cWe are laborers together with God.\u201d Every day brings to the one\nin God\u2019s service duties proportionate to his powers. His usefulness\nincreases as, under the guidance of a supreme Power, he performs\nthese duties. The fulfillment of one duty makes us better prepared\nColor Line 189\nto take up another. Those who have a true sense of what is to be\ndone will place themselves in the direct light of the word of God, [221]\nin union with His other working forces. Every day, clothed with\nthe whole armor, he will go forth into the battle. With prayer and\nwatchfulness and perseverance he will labor, determined that the\nclose of his lifework shall not find him unprepared, not having done\nall that he could for the salvation of perishing souls.\nIf Christians were to act in concert, moving forward as one,\nunder the direction of one Power, for the accomplishment of one\npurpose, they would move the world.\n* * * * *\nThe principles that should actuate us as workers in God\u2019s cause\nare laid down by the apostle Paul. He says: \u201cWe are laborers together\nwith God.\u201d 1 Corinthians 3:9. \u201cWhatsoever ye do, do it heartily,as\nto the Lord, and not unto men.\u201d Colossians 3:23. And Peter exhorts\nthe believers: \u201cAs every man hath received the gift, even so minister\nthe same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace\nof God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if\nany man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth:\nthat God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ.\u201d 1 Peter\n4:10, 11.\n* * * * *\nThere are great laws that govern the world of nature, and spiritual\nthings are controlled by principles equally certain. The means for an\nend must be employed, if the desired results are to be attained. God\nhas appointed to every man his work according to his ability. It is by\neducation and practice that persons are to be qualified to meet any\nemergency which may arise; and wise planning is needed to place\neach one in his proper sphere, that he may obtain an experience that [222]\nwill fit him to bear responsibility.\nGod wants us to help one another by a manifestation of sympathy\nand unselfish love. There are those who have inherited peculiar\ntempers and dispositions. They may be hard to deal with; but are we\nfaultless? They are not to be discouraged. Their errors are not to\n190 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nbe made common property. Christ pities and helps those who err in\njudgment. He has suffered death for every man, and because of this\nHe has a touching and profound interest in every man.\nA man may be trying to serve God, but temptations from within\nand from without assail him. Satan and his angels urge and coax\nhim to transgress. Perhaps he falls a prey to their temptings. How\nthen do his brethren treat him? Do they speak harsh, cutting words,\ndriving him further from the Saviour? What a sad sight for Christ\nand the angels to behold!\nLet us remember that we are struggling and falling, failing in\nspeech and action to represent Christ, falling and rising again, de-\nspairing and hoping. Let us beware of dealing unkindly with those\nwho, like ourselves, are subjects of temptation and who, like our-\nselves also, are the objects of Christ\u2019s unfailing love.\n* * * * *\nGod deals with men as responsible beings. He will work by His\nSpirit through the mind He has put in man if man will only give Him\na chance to work and will recognize His dealings. He designs that\neach shall use his mind and conscience for himself. He does not\nintend that one man shall become the shadow of another, uttering\nonly another\u2019s sentiments.\nChapter 25\u2014Consideration for Colored Laborers [223]\nThe religion of the Bible recognizes no caste or color. It ignores\nrank, wealth, worldly honor. God estimates men as men. With Him,\ncharacter decides their worth. And we are to recognize the Spirit\nof Christ in whomsoever it is revealed. No one need be ashamed to\nspeak with an honest black man in any place or to shake him by the\nhand. He who is living in the atmosphere in which Christ lives will\nbe taught of God and will learn to put His estimate on men.\nOur colored ministers are to be treated with consideration. This\nhas not always been done. These men are to be encouraged to obtain\na thorough knowledge of the truth. They are to learn how to be\nefficient in teaching the truth to others. And when they are faithfully\nengaged in work they should receive their hire. Remember that they\nmust have bread.\nThe Lord desires His people in the North to maintain a kindly\nattitude toward the colored brethren and sisters. We should not be\nhasty in finding fault with them. We cannot expect them to be in all\nrespects like those who have enjoyed greater advantages. We should\nremember the disadvantages under which the colored people have\nlived. Far different from the surroundings of the white race have\nbeen their surroundings. The Northern people have lived in a clearer,\npurer moral atmosphere than have the colored people of the South.\nWe cannot expect that, in all things, they will be as firm and clear in\ntheir ideas of morality. Were Christ on earth today, He would teach\nthe Negro race in a way that would surprise us. He calls upon us to\nremember that even those who have had great advantages in many\nthings often feel hurt if their errors are unduly noticed and if words [224]\nof counsel and admonition are spoken in an unsympathetic manner.\nWhen things of an objectionable nature take place among the\ncolored people, remember that the Lord desires you to act with\nthe wisdom of a faithful shepherd. Remember that kindness will\naccomplish more than censure. Let the colored brethren and sisters\nsee that their brethren want them to reach the highest standard and\n191\n192 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthat they are willing to help them. And if in some things the colored\npeople fail, do not be quick to condemn them and separate them\nfrom the work.\nExact and impartial justice is to be shown to the Negro race.\nChrist demands from His servants tender compassion for the suffer-\ning, sympathy for the unfortunate, and a generous consideration for\nmisdemeanors.\n* * * * *\nThe poor are not excluded from the privilege of giving. They,\nas well as the wealthy, may act a part in this work. The lesson that\nChrist gave in regard to the widow\u2019s two mites shows us that the\nsmallest willing offerings of the poor, if given from a heart of love,\nare as acceptable as the largest donations of the rich. In the balances\nof the sanctuary, the gifts of the poor, made from love to Christ, are\nnot estimated according to the amount given, but according to the\nlove which prompts the sacrifice.\nChapter 26\u2014The Needs of a Mission Field [225]\nFor many years the Lord has been keeping before His people the\nneeds of the work among the colored people in the Southern States\nof America. The moral darkness of this field is, in itself, a powerful\nplea for the exercise of liberality. In the past some have done what\nthey could to support this branch of our work, and their beneficence\nhas borne fruit in the conversion of many souls.\nAlthough much remains to be done for the colored people, we\nhave cause for rejoicing over the good beginning that has been\nmade. In a recent number of The Gospel Herald [1907] it is reported\nthat \u201cfifteen years ago there were not over twenty colored Seventh-\nday Adventists south of Mason and Dixon\u2019s line; but today there\nare seven hundred. Twelve years ago there was only one colored\nSeventh-day Adventists church; today there are fifty, not counting\nthose in Africa and the West Indies.... The tithe of the colored\npeople last year in the United States amounted to five thousand\ndollars; fifteen years ago it was not over fifty dollars.\u201d\nLet us thank God, dear brethren and sisters, and take courage!\nGod is laying bare His arm to do a mighty work in this mission field\nwithin the borders of our own land. He is now giving His people\nunusual opportunities to extend the message rapidly in the South.\nEspecially should we reveal a spirit of beneficence at the time the\nyearly offering for the support of the colored work is taken up. God\nhas reposed confidence in us by making us stewards of means and of\nHis rich grace; and He now points us to the poor and suffering and\noppressed, to souls bound in chains of superstition and error, and\nassures us that if we do good to these, He will accept the deed as [226]\nthough done to Himself. \u201cInasmuch as ye have done it unto one of\nthe least of these My brethren,\u201d He declares, \u201cye have done it unto\nMe.\u201d Matthew 25:40.\nThousands of colored people in the South may now be uplifted,\nand become human agents to help their own race, if they can receive\nthe help God is calling upon us to give them. Multitudes of men\n193\n194 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nand women in this field feel their deep poverty and their need of\nuplifting. And when faithful teachers shall come in to open to them\nthe Scriptures just as they read, presenting truth in its native purity,\nthe darkness will disappear. Bright beams of light will shine upon the\nsoul searching for truth. And with those who have had advantages, a\nclose and intelligent investigation will take place upon the subjects\nof truth revealed in the Scriptures. Many will be taught of God. They\nwill learn aright from the Great Teacher, and will accept with joy\nthe truths that will sanctify and uplift. The moral image of God will\nbe restored in the soul, and many will be eternally saved.\nMy dear brethren and sisters, Christ is now saying to you: \u201cLift\nup your eyes and look on this Southern field; for it needs work-\ners\u2014sowers of the seed, and reapers. It needs your means for the\nmaintenance of these workers.\u201d The grace of Christ is unlimited, it\nis God\u2019s free gift. Then why should not this neglected people have\nsome hope and courage and faith brought into their lives? There is\nsunshine in the heart for all who will accept Christ.\nSeptember, 1907.\nSection 7\u2014The Religious Liberty Work [227]\n[<span class=\"non-egw-comment\" >In this section, por-\ntions of only a few manuscripts (hitherto unpublished) are\ngiven.

It becomes us now to use\nall our capabilities and gifts in advancing the work of God. The\npowers the Lord has given us are to be used to build up, not to tear\ndown. Those who are ignorantly deceived are not to remain in this\ncondition. The Lord says to His messengers: Go to them and declare\nunto them what I have said, whether they will hear, or whether they\nwill forbear.\nThe time is right upon us when persecution will come to those\nwho proclaim the truth. The outlook is not flattering; but, notwith-\nstanding this, let us not give up our efforts to save those ready to\nperish, for whose ransom the Prince of heaven offered up His pre-\ncious life. When one means fails, try another. Our efforts must\nnot be dead and lifeless. As long as life is spared, let us work for\nGod. In all ages of the church God\u2019s appointed messengers have\nexposed themselves to reproach and persecution for the truth\u2019s sake.\nBut wherever God\u2019s people may be forced to go, even though, like\nthe beloved disciple, they are banished to desert islands, Christ will[228]\nknow where they are and will strengthen and bless them, filling them\nwith peace and joy.\nSoon there is to be trouble all over the world. It becomes every-\none to seek to know God. We have no time to delay. With earnestness\nand fervor the message must be given: \u201cHo, everyone that thirsteth,\ncome ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy,\nand eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without\nprice.\u201d Isaiah 55:1. \u201cThus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do\njustice: for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to\nbe revealed. Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the Son of man\nthat layeth hold on it; that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and\nkeepeth his hand from doing any evil.\u201d Isaiah 56:1, 2.\nGod\u2019s love for His church is infinite. His care over His heritage\nis unceasing. He suffers no affliction to come upon the church but\nsuch as is essential for her purification, her present and eternal good.\n196\nTime of Trial Before Us 197\nHe will purify His church even as He purified the temple at the\nbeginning and close of His ministry on earth. All that He brings\nupon the church in test and trial comes that His people may gain\ndeeper piety and more strength to carry the triumphs of the cross\nto all parts of the world. He has a work for all to do. There must\nbe constant enlargement and progress. The work must extend from\ncity to city, from country to country, and from nation to nation,\nmoving continually onward and upward, established, strengthened,\nand settled.\n* * * * *\n\u201cThe Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, ... full of grace\nand truth.\u201d But those whom Christ came to save, would have none\nof Him. \u201cHe came unto His own, and His own received Him not.\u201d [229]\nJohn 1:14, 11. Yielding themselves to Satan\u2019s control, they rejected\nthe Messiah and sought opportunity to put Him to death.\nSatan and his angels determined to make Christ\u2019s death as hu-\nmiliating as possible. They filled the hearts of the Jewish leaders\nwith feelings of bitter hatred against the Saviour. Controlled by the\nenemy, priests and rulers stirred the multitude to take part against\nthe Son of God. Aside from Pilate\u2019s declaration of His innocence,\nno one spoke a word in His favor. And even Pilate, knowing His\ninnocence, gave Him over to the abuse of men under the control of\nSatan.\nSimilar events will take place in the near future. Men will exalt\nand rigidly enforce laws that are in direct opposition to the law\nof God. Though zealous in enforcing their own commandments,\nthey will turn away from a plain \u201cThus saith the Lord.\u201d Exalting\na spurious rest day, they will seek to force men to dishonor the\nlaw of Jehovah, the transcript of His character. Though innocent\nof wrongdoing, the servants of God will be given over to suffer\nhumiliation and abuse at the hands of those who, inspired by Satan,\nare filled with envy and religious bigotry.\n* * * * *\nReligious powers, allied to heaven by profession, and claiming\nto have the characteristics of a lamb, will show by their acts that\n198 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthey have the heart of a dragon and that they are instigated and\ncontrolled by Satan. The time is coming when God\u2019s people will\nfeel the hand of persecution because they keep holy the seventh day.\nSatan has caused the change of the Sabbath in the hope of carrying\nout his purpose for the defeat of God\u2019s plans. He seeks to make the\ncommands of God of less force in the world than human laws. The [230]\nman of sin, who thought to change times and laws, and who has\nalways oppressed the people of God, will cause laws to be made\nenforcing the observance of the first day of the week. But God\u2019s\npeople are to stand firm for Him. And the Lord will work in their\nbehalf, showing plainly that He is the God of gods.\n* * * * *\nThe Lord has said: \u201cVerily My Sabbaths ye shall keep: for it\nis a sign between Me and you throughout your generations.\u201d Exo-\ndus 31:13. None should disobey His command in order to escape\npersecution. But let all consider the words of Christ: \u201cWhen they\npersecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\u201d Matthew 10:23. If it\ncan be avoided, do not put yourselves into the power of men who are\nworked by the spirit of antichrist. Everything that we can do should\nbe done that those who are willing to suffer for the truth\u2019s sake may\nbe saved from oppression and cruelty.\nChrist is our example. The determination of antichrist to carry\nout the rebellion he began in heaven will continue to work in the\nchildren of disobedience. Their envy and hatred against those who\nobey the fourth commandment will wax more and more bitter. But\nthe people of God are not to hide their banner. They are not to ignore\nthe commandments of God and, in order to have an easy time, go\nwith the multitude to do evil.\nThe Lord encourages all who seek Him with the whole heart. He\ngives them His Holy Spirit, the manifestation of His presence and\nfavor. But those who forsake God in order to save their lives will be\nforsaken by Him. In seeking to save their lives by yielding the truth,\nthey will lose eternal life.\nThe night of trial is nearly spent. Satan is bringing in his masterly[231]\npower because he knoweth that his time is short. The chastisement\nof God is upon the world to call all who know the truth to hide in\nTime of Trial Before Us 199\nthe cleft of the Rock and view the glory of God. The truth must\nnot be muffled now. Plain statements must be made. Unvarnished\ntruth must be spoken, in leaflets and pamphlets, and these must be\nscattered like the leaves of autumn.\n* * * * *\nThe remnant church will be brought into great trial and distress.\nThose who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus\nwill feel the ire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan numbers the world\nas his subjects, he has gained control of the apostate churches; but\nhere is a little company that are resisting his supremacy. If he could\nblot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete. As he\ninfluenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel, so in the near future\nhe will stir up the wicked powers of earth to destroy the people of\nGod. All will be required to render obedience to human edicts in\nviolation of the divine law. Those who will be true to God and to\nduty will be menaced, denounced, and proscribed. They will be\nbetrayed \u201cboth by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends.\u201d\nLuke 21:16. [Testimonies for the Church 5:472, 473.]\n* * * * *\n\u201cHearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, the people in\nwhose heart is My law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be\nye afraid of their revilings. For the moth shall eat them up like a\ngarment, and the worm shall eat them like wool;\u201d \u201cbut My salvation\nshall be forever, and My righteousness shall not be abolished.\u201d Isaiah\n51:7, 8, 6.\nChapter 28\u2014Sunday Labor[232]\nSanitarium, California,\nAugust 17, 1902.\nDear Brother,\nI will try to answer your question as to what you should do in\nthe case of Sunday laws being enforced.\nThe light given me by the Lord at a time when we were expecting\njust such a crisis as you seem to be approaching, was that when the\npeople were moved by a power from beneath to enforce Sunday\nobservance, Seventh-day Adventists were to show their wisdom\nby refraining from their ordinary work on that day, devoting it to\nmissionary effort.\nTo defy the Sunday laws will but strengthen in their persecution\nthe religious zealots who are seeking to enforce them. Give them no\noccasion to call you lawbreakers. If they are left to rein up men who\nfear neither God nor man, the reining up will soon lose its novelty\nfor them, and they will see that it is not consistent nor convenient\nfor them to be strict in regard to the observance of Sunday. Keep\nright on with your missionary work, with your Bibles in your hands,\nand the enemy will see that he has worsted his own cause. One does\nnot receive the mark of the beast because he shows that he realizes\nthe wisdom of keeping the peace by refraining from work that gives\noffense, doing at the same time a work of the highest importance.\nWhen we devote Sunday to missionary work, the whip will be\ntaken out of the hands of the arbitrary zealots who would be well\npleased to humiliate Seventh-day Adventists. When they see that\nwe employ ourselves on Sunday in visiting the people and opening\nthe Scriptures to them, they will know that it is useless for them to[233]\ntry to hinder our work by making Sunday laws.\nSunday can be used for carrying forward various lines of work\nthat will accomplish much for the Lord. On this day open-air meet-\nings and cottage meetings can be held. House-to-house work can be\ndone. Those who write can devote this day to writing their articles.\n200\nSunday Labor 201\nWhenever it is possible, let religious services be held on Sunday.\nMake these meetings intensely interesting. Sing genuine revival\nhymns, and speak with power and assurance of the Saviour\u2019s love.\nSpeak on temperance and on true religious experience. You will\nthus learn much about how to work, and will reach many souls.\nLet the teachers in our schools devote Sunday to missionary\neffort. I was instructed that they would thus be able to defeat the\npurposes of the enemy. Let the teachers take the students with them\nto hold meetings for those who know not the truth. Thus they will\naccomplish much more than they could in any other way.\nGod has given us plain directions regarding our work. We are to\nproclaim the truth in regard to the Sabbath of the Lord, to make up\nthe breach that has been made in His law. We are to do all that we\ncan to enlighten those in ignorance; but we are never to confederate\nwith men of the world in order to receive financial assistance.\nOf the children of Israel we read: \u201cWherefore I caused them\nto go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the\nwilderness. And I gave them My statutes, and showed them My\njudgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them. Moreover\nalso I gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them,\nthat they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. But the [234]\nhouse of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness: they walked\nnot in My statutes, and they despised My judgments, which if a\nman do, he shall even live in them; and My Sabbaths they greatly\npolluted: then I said, I would pour out My fury upon them in the\nwilderness, to consume them.\n\u201cBut I wrought for My name\u2019s sake, that it should not be polluted\nbefore the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out. Yet also I\nlifted up My hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not\nbring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk\nand honey, which is the glory of all lands; because they despised My\njudgments, and walked not in My statutes, but polluted My Sabbaths:\nfor their heart went after their idols. Nevertheless Mine eye spared\nthem from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the\nwilderness. But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye\nnot in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments,\nnor defile yourselves with their idols: I am the Lord your God; walk\nin My statutes, and keep My judgments, and do them; and hallow\n202 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nMy Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye\nmay know that I am the Lord your God.\u201d Ezekiel 20:10-20.\nThe Sabbath is the Lord\u2019s test, and no man, be he king, priest, or\nruler, is authorized to come between God and man. Those who seek\nto be conscience for their fellow men, place themselves above God.\nThose who are under the influence of a false religion, who observe a\nspurious rest day, will set aside the most positive evidence in regard\nto the true Sabbath. They will try to compel men to obey the laws of\ntheir own creation, laws that are directly opposed to the law of God.\nUpon those who continue in this course, the wrath of God will fall.[235]\nUnless they change, they cannot escape the penalty.\nThe law for the observance of the first day of the week is the\nproduction of an apostate Christendom. Sunday is a child of the\npapacy, exalted by the Christian world above the sacred day of God\u2019s\nrest. In no case are God\u2019s people to pay it homage. But I wish them to\nunderstand that they are not doing God\u2019s will by braving opposition\nwhen He wishes them to avoid it. Thus they create prejudice so\nbitter that it is impossible for the truth to be proclaimed. Make no\ndemonstration on Sunday in defiance of law. If this is done in one\nplace, and you are humiliated, the same thing will be done in another\nplace. We can use Sunday as a day on which to carry forward work\nthat will tell on the side of Christ. We are to do our best, working\nwith all meekness and lowliness.\nChrist warned His disciples in regard to what they would meet\nin their work as evangelists. He knew what their sufferings would\nbe, what trials and hardships they would be called upon to bear. He\nwould not hide from them the knowledge of what they would have\nto encounter, lest trouble, coming unexpectedly, should shake their\nfaith. \u201cI have told you before it come to pass,\u201d He said, \u201cthat, when\nit is come to pass, ye might believe.\u201d John 14:29. Their faith was to\nbe strengthened, rather than weakened, by the coming of trial. They\nwould say to one another: \u201cHe told us that this would come, and\nwhat we must do to meet it.\u201d\n\u201cBehold,\u201d Christ said, \u201cI send you forth as sheep in the midst of\nwolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.\u201d \u201cYe\nshall be hated of all men for My name\u2019s sake: but he that endureth\nto the end shall be saved.\u201d Matthew 10:16, 22. They hated Christ\nwithout a cause. Is it any marvel that they hate those who bear His[236]\nSunday Labor 203\nsign, who do His service? They are counted as the offscouring of\nthe earth.\n\u201cWhen they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another.\u201d It\nis not the will of God that your lives shall be carelessly sacrificed.\n\u201cVerily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of\nIsrael, till the Son of man be come.\u201d Verse 23.\nThe people must be given the truth, straightforward, positive\ntruth. But this truth is to be presented in the spirit of Christ. We\nare to be as sheep in the midst of wolves. Those who will not,\nfor Christ\u2019s sake, observe the cautions He has given, who will not\nexercise patience and self-control, will lose precious opportunities\nof working for the Master. The Lord has not given His people the\nwork of making a tirade against those who are transgressing His\nlaw. In no case are we to make a raid on the other churches. Let us\nremember that, as a people entrusted with sacred truth, we have been\nneglectful and positively unfaithful. The work has been confined to\na few centers until the people in them have become gospel-hardened.\nIt is difficult to make an impression on those who have heard so\nmuch truth, and yet have rejected it....\nAll this is against us now. Had we put forth earnest efforts to\nreach those who, if converted, would give a true representation of\nwhat present truth would do for human beings, how much further\nadvanced our work would now be. It is not right that a few places\nshould have all the advantages while other places are neglected.\n* * * * *\nAt our Avondale school, near Cooranbong, Australia, the Sunday\nlabor question came up for decision. It seemed as if the lines were [237]\nsoon to be drawn so tightly about us that we should not be able to\nwork during Sunday. Our school was situated in the heart of the\nwoods, far from any village or railway station. No one was living\nnear enough to us to be disturbed in any way by anything we might\ndo. Nevertheless, we were watched. The officers were urged to come\naround to inspect our premises, and they did come. They could have\nseen many things if they had desired to prosecute us, but they did\nnot appear to notice those who were at work. They had so much\nconfidence in us as a people, and so great respect for us on account\n204 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nof the work we had done in that community, that they believed they\ncould trust us anywhere.\nMany recognized the fact that the whole community had been\ntransformed since we went there. A woman who was not a Sabbath-\nkeeper said to me: \u201cYou would not believe me if I should inform\nyou fully in regard to the transformation that has taken place in this\ncommunity as the result of your moving here, establishing a school,\nand holding these little meetings.\u201d\nSo when our brethren were threatened with persecution and\nthrown into perplexity in regard to what they should do, the same\nadvice was given as was given in answer to the question concerning\ngames. I said: \u201cEmploy Sunday in doing missionary work for God.\nTeachers, go with your students. Take them into the bush [this is what\nwe called the sparsely settled districts in the woods, where houses\nare often a mile or two apart], and visit the people in their homes.\nLet them know that you are interested in their soul\u2019s salvation.\u201d They\ndid so and, as the result, were greatly benefited themselves and were\nable to help others as well. The blessing of God rested upon them\nas they diligently searched the Scriptures in order to learn how to[238]\npresent the truths of the word in such a way that these truths would\nbe received with favor.\nAugust 20, 1903.\n* * * * *\nAt one time those in charge of our school at Avondale inquired\nof me, saying: \u201cWhat shall we do? The officers of the law have\nbeen commissioned to arrest those working on Sunday.\u201d I replied:\n\u201cIt will be very easy to avoid that difficulty. Give Sunday to the\nLord as a day for doing missionary work. Take the students out\nto hold meetings in different places, and to do medical missionary\nwork. They will find the people at home and will have a splendid\nopportunity to present the truth. This way of spending Sunday is\nalways acceptable to the Lord.\u201d\n* * * * *\nSunday Labor 205\nWe are to do all we can to remove the prejudice that exists in the\nminds of many against our work and against the Bible Sabbath.\n* * * * *\nTeach the people to conform in all things to the laws of their\nstate when they can do so without conflicting with the law of God.\n* * * * *\nSometimes the hearts of persecutors are susceptible of divine im-\npressions as was the heart of the apostle Paul before his conversion.\nChapter 29\u2014Words of Caution[239]\nChrist said to His disciples: \u201cBehold, I send you forth as sheep in\nthe midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless\nas doves.\u201d Matthew 10:16. Satan\u2019s attacks against the advocates\nof the truth will wax more bitter and determined to the very close\nof time. As in Christ\u2019s day the chief priests and rulers stirred up\nthe people against Him, so today the religious leaders will excite\nbitterness and prejudice against the truth for this time. The people\nwill be led to acts of violence and opposition which they would\nnever have thought of had they not been imbued with the animosity\nof professed Christians against the truth.\nWhat course shall the advocates of truth pursue? They have the\nunchangeable, eternal word of God, and they should reveal the fact\nthat they have the truth as it is in Jesus. Their words must not be\nrugged and sharp. In their presentation of truth they must manifest\nthe love and meekness and gentleness of Christ. Let the truth do the\ncutting; the word of God is as a sharp, two-edged sword and will\ncut its way to the heart. Those who know that they have the truth\nshould not, by the use of harsh and severe expressions, give Satan\none chance to misinterpret their spirit.\nAs a people we must stand as did the world\u2019s Redeemer. When in\ncontroversy with Satan in regard to the body of Moses, Christ durst\nnot bring against him a railing accusation. He had every provocation\nto do this, and Satan was disappointed because he could not arouse\nin Christ a spirit of retaliation. Satan was ready to misinterpret\neverything that was done by Jesus; and the Saviour would give him\nno occasion, not the semblance of an excuse. He would not turn from[240]\nHis straightforward course of truth in order to follow the wanderings\nand twistings and turnings and prevarications of Satan.\nWe read in the prophecy of Zechariah that when Satan with all\nhis synagogue stood up to resist the prayers of Joshua the high priest,\nand to resist Christ, who was about to show decided favor to Joshua:\n\u201cThe Lord said unto Satan, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even\n206\nWords of Caution 207\nthe Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand\nplucked out of the fire?\u201d Zechariah 3:2.\nThe course of Christ in dealing even with the adversary of souls\nshould be an example to us in all our intercourse with others never to\nbring a railing accusation against any; much less should we employ\nharshness or severity toward those who may be as anxious to know\nthe right way as we are ourselves.\nThose who have been educated in the truth by precept and ex-\nample should make great allowance for others who have had no\nknowledge of the Scriptures except through the interpretations given\nby ministers and church members, and who have received traditions\nand fables as Bible truth. They are surprised by the presentation\nof truth, it is as a new revelation to them, and they cannot bear to\nhave all the truth, in its most striking character, presented to them\nat the outset. All is new and strange, and wholly unlike that which\nthey have heard from their ministers; and they are inclined to believe\nwhat the ministers have told them\u2014that Seventh-day Adventists are\ninfidels and do not believe the Bible. Let the truth be presented as\nit is in Jesus, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and\nthere a little.\nLet not those who write for our papers make unkind thrusts and\nallusions that will certainly do harm and that will hedge up the way [241]\nand hinder us from doing the work that we should do in order to reach\nall classes, the Catholics included. It is our work to speak the truth in\nlove and not to mix in with the truth the unsanctified elements of the\nnatural heart and speak things that savor of the same spirit possessed\nby our enemies. All sharp thrusts will come back upon us in double\nmeasure when the power is in the hands of those who can exercise\nit for injury. Over and over the message has been given to me that\nwe are not to say one word, not to publish one sentence, especially\nby way of personalities, unless positively essential in vindicating\nthe truth, that will stir up our enemies against us and arouse their\npassions to a white heat. Our work will soon be closed up, and soon\nthe time of trouble, such as never was, will come upon us, of which\nwe have but little idea.\nThe Lord wants His workers to represent Him, the great Mis-\nsionary Worker. The manifestation of rashness always does harm.\nThe proprieties essential for Christian life must be learned daily in\n208 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthe school of Christ. He who is careless and heedless in uttering\nwords or in writing words for publication to be sent broadcast into\nthe world, sending forth expressions that can never be taken back,\nis disqualifying himself to be entrusted with the sacred work that\ndevolves upon Christ\u2019s followers at this time. Those who prac-\ntice giving harsh thrusts are forming habits that will strengthen by\nrepetition and will have to be repented of.\nWe should carefully examine our ways and our spirit, and see in\nwhat manner we are doing the work given us of God, which involves\nthe destiny of souls. The very highest obligation is resting upon\nus. Satan is standing ready, burning with zeal to inspire the whole\nconfederacy of satanic agencies, that he may cause them to unite[242]\nwith evil men and bring upon the believers of truth speedy and severe\nsuffering. Every unwise word that is uttered through our brethren\nwill be treasured up by the prince of darkness.\nI should like to ask: How dare finite human intelligences speak\ncareless and venturesome words that will stir up the powers of hell\nagainst the saints of God, when Michael the Archangel durst not\nbring against Satan a railing accusation, but said: \u201cThe Lord rebuke\nthee\u201d? Jude 1:9.\nIt will be impossible for us to avoid difficulties and suffering.\nJesus said: \u201cWoe unto the world because of offenses! for it must\nneeds be that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the\noffense cometh!\u201d Matthew 18:7. But because offense will come,\nwe should be careful not to stir up the natural temperament of those\nwho love not the truth, by unwise words and by the manifestation of\nan unkind spirit.\nPrecious truth must be presented in its native force. The de-\nceptive errors that are widespread, and that are leading the world\ncaptive, are to be unveiled. Every effort possible is being made to\nensnare souls with subtle reasonings, to turn them from the truth to\nfables, and to prepare them to be deceived by strong delusions. But\nwhile these deceived souls turn from the truth to error, do not speak\nto them one word of censure. Seek to show these poor, deluded souls\ntheir danger and to reveal to them how grievous is their course of\naction toward Jesus Christ; but let it all be done in pitying tenderness.\nBy a proper manner of labor some of the souls who are ensnared\nby Satan may be recovered from his power. But do not blame and\nWords of Caution 209\ncondemn them. To ridicule the position held by those who are in\nerror will not open their blind eyes nor attract them to the truth.\nWhen men lose sight of Christ\u2019s example and do not pattern after [243]\nHis manner of teaching, they become self-sufficient and go forth to\nmeet Satan with his own manner of weapons. The enemy knows\nwell how to turn his weapons upon those who use them. Jesus spoke\nonly words of pure truth and righteousness.\nIf ever a people needed to walk in humility before God, it is His\nchurch, His chosen ones in this generation. We all need to bewail the\ndullness of our intellectual faculties, the lack of appreciation of our\nprivileges and opportunities. We have nothing whereof to boast. We\ngrieve the Lord Jesus Christ by our harshness, by our un-Christlike\nthrusts. We need to become complete in Him.\nIt is true that we are commanded to \u201ccry aloud, spare not, lift up\nthy voice like a trumpet, and show My people their transgression,\nand the house of Jacob their sins.\u201d Isaiah 58:1. This message must\nbe given; but while it must be given, we should be careful not to\nthrust and crowd and condemn those who have not the light that\nwe have. We should not go out of our way to make hard thrusts at\nthe Catholics. Among the Catholics there are many who are most\nconscientious Christians and who walk in all the light that shines\nupon them, and God will work in their behalf. Those who have had\ngreat privileges and opportunities, and who have failed to improve\ntheir physical, mental, and moral powers, but who have lived to\nplease themselves and have refused to bear their responsibility, are\nin greater danger and in greater condemnation before God than those\nwho are in error upon doctrinal points, yet who seek to live to do\ngood to others. Do not censure others; do not condemn them.\nIf we allow selfish considerations, false reasoning, and false\nexcuses to bring us into a perverse state of mind and heart, so that\nwe shall not know the ways and will of God, we shall be far more [244]\nguilty than the open sinner. We need to be very cautious in order\nthat we may not condemn those who, before God, are less guilty\nthan ourselves.\n* * * * *\n210 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nLet everyone bear in mind that we are in no case to invite per-\nsecution. We are not to use harsh and cutting words. Keep them\nout of every article written, drop them out of every address given.\nLet the word of God do the cutting, the rebuking; let finite men hide\nand abide in Jesus Christ. Let the spirit of Christ appear. Let all\nbe guarded in their words, lest they place those not of our faith in\ndeadly opposition against us and give Satan an opportunity to use\nthe unadvised words to hedge up our way.\n* * * * *\nThere is to be a time of trouble such as never was since there\nwas a nation. Our work is to study to weed out of all our discourses\neverything that savors of retaliation and defiance and making a drive\nagainst churches and individuals, because this is not Christ\u2019s way\nand method.\n* * * * *\nThe fact that God\u2019s people, who know the truth, have failed to do\ntheir duty according to the light given in the word of God makes it a\nnecessity for us to be the more guarded, lest we offend unbelievers\nbefore they have heard the reasons for our faith in regard to the\nSabbath and Sunday.\nSection 8\u2014Timely Counsels [245]\n\u201cBehold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that no\nman take thy crown. \u201d Revelation 3:11.\nChapter 30\u2014Faithful Stewardship\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the San Jose (California)\nState Conference, January, 1907.]\nChrist has purchased us by the price of His own blood. He has\npaid the purchase money for our redemption, and if we will lay hold\nupon the treasure, it is ours by the free gift of God.\n\u201cHow much owest thou unto my Lord?\u201d Luke 16:5. It is impossi-\nble to tell. All that we have is from God. He lays His hand upon our\npossessions, saying: \u201cI am the rightful owner of the whole universe;\nthese are My goods. Consecrate to Me the tithes and offerings.\nAs you bring these specified goods as a token of your loyalty and\nyour submission to My sovereignty, My blessing shall increase your\nsubstance, and you will have abundance.\u201d\nGod is testing every soul that claims to believe in Him. All are\nentrusted with talents. The Lord has given men His goods upon\nwhich to trade. He has made them His stewards, and has placed\nin their possession money, houses, and lands. All these are to be\nregarded as the Lord\u2019s goods and used to advance His work, to build\nup His kingdom in the world. In trading with the Lord\u2019s goods,\nwe are to seek Him for wisdom, that we may not use His sacred\ntrust to glorify ourselves or to indulge selfish impulses. The amount\nentrusted varies, but those who have the smallest gifts must not feel\nthat because their talent of means is small, they can do nothing with[246]\nit.\nEvery Christian is a steward of God, entrusted with His goods.\nRemember the words: \u201cMoreover it is required in stewards, that a\nman be found faithful.\u201d 1 Corinthians 4:2. Let us be sure that we are\nnot robbing God in any jots or tittles, for much is involved in this\nquestion.\nAll things belong to God. Men may ignore His claims. While\nHe bountifully bestows His blessings upon them, they may use His\n212\nFaithful Stewardship 213\ngifts for their own selfish gratification; but they will be called to give\nan account for their stewardship.\nA steward identifies himself with his master. He accepts the\nresponsibilities of a steward, and he must act in his master\u2019s stead,\ndoing as his master would do were he presiding. His master\u2019s\ninterests become his. The position of a steward is one of dignity\nbecause his master trusts him. If in any wise he acts selfishly and\nturns the advantages gained by trading with his lord\u2019s goods to his\nown advantage, he has perverted the trust reposed in him.\nThe Support of the Gospel\nThe Lord has made the proclamation of the gospel dependent\nupon the labors and the voluntary gifts of all His people. The one\nwho proclaims the message of mercy to fallen men has another work\nalso\u2014to set before the people the duty of sustaining the work of God\nwith their means. He must teach them that a portion of their income\nbelongs to God and is to be sacredly bestowed to His work. This\nlesson he should present by both precept and example; he should\nbeware that he does not by his own course lessen the force of his\nteaching.\nThat which has been set apart according to the Scriptures as\nbelonging to the Lord constitutes the revenue of the gospel and is [247]\nno longer ours. It is no better than sacrilege for a man to take from\nGod\u2019s treasury in order to serve himself or to serve others in their\nsecular business. Some have been at fault in diverting from the altar\nof God that which has been especially dedicated to Him. All should\nregard this matter in the right light. Let no one, when brought into a\nstrait place, take money consecrated to religious purposes and use\nit for his advantage, soothing his conscience by saying that he will\nrepay it at some future time. Far better cut down the expenses to\ncorrespond with the income, to restrict the wants, and live within\nthe means than to use the Lord\u2019s money for secular purposes.\nThe Use of the Tithe\nGod has given special direction as to the use of the tithe. He does\nnot design that His work shall be crippled for want of means. That\n214 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthere may be no haphazard work and no error, He has made our duty\non these points very plain. The portion that God has reserved for\nHimself is not to be diverted to any other purpose than that which\nHe has specified. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to\nuse according to their own judgment. They are not to use it for\nthemselves in an emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even in\nwhat they may regard as the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe minister should, by precept and example, teach the people\nto regard the tithe as sacred. He should not feel that he can retain\nand apply it according to his own judgment because he is a minister.\nIt is not his. He is not at liberty to devote to himself whatever he\nthinks is his due. He should not give his influence to any plans for\ndiverting from their legitimate use the tithes and offerings dedicated\nto God. They are to be placed in His treasury and held sacred for[248]\nHis service as He has appointed.\nGod desires all His stewards to be exact in following divine\narrangements. They are not to offset the Lord\u2019s plans by performing\nsome deed of charity or giving some gift or some offering when or\nhow they, the human agents, shall see fit. It is a very poor policy\nfor men to seek to improve on God\u2019s plan, and invent a makeshift,\naveraging up their good impulses on this and that occasion, and\noffsetting them against God\u2019s requirements. God calls upon all to\ngive their influence to His own arrangement. He has made His plan\nknown, and all who would co-operate with Him must carry out this\nplan instead of daring to attempt an improvement on it.\nThe Lord instructed Moses, for Israel: \u201cThou shalt command\nthe children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for\nthe light, to cause the lamp to burn always.\u201d Exodus 27:20. This\nwas to be a continual offering, that the house of God might be\nproperly supplied with that which was necessary for His service.\nHis people today are to remember that the house of worship is the\nLord\u2019s property and that it is to be scrupulously cared for. But the\nfunds for this work are not to come from the tithe.\nA very plain, definite message has been given to me for our\npeople. I am bidden to tell them that they are making a mistake in\napplying the tithe to various objects which, though good in them-\nselves, are not the object to which the Lord has said that the tithe\nFaithful Stewardship 215\nshould be applied. Those who make this use of the tithe are departing\nfrom the Lord\u2019s arrangement. God will judge for these things.\nOne reasons that the tithe may be applied to school purposes.\nStill others reason that canvassers and colporteurs should be sup- [249]\nported from the tithe. But a great mistake is made when the tithe\nis drawn from the object for which it is to be used\u2014the support of\nthe ministers. There should be today in the field one hundred well\nqualified laborers where now there is but one.\nA Solemn Obligation\nThe tithe is sacred, reserved by God for Himself. It is to be\nbrought into His treasury to be used to sustain the gospel laborers in\ntheir work. For a long time the Lord has been robbed because there\nare those who do not realize that the tithe is God\u2019s reserved portion.\nSome have been dissatisfied and have said: \u201cI will not longer pay\nmy tithe; for I have no confidence in the way things are managed\nat the heart of the work.\u201d But will you rob God because you think\nthe management of the work is not right? Make your complaint,\nplainly and openly, in the right spirit, to the proper ones. Send\nin your petitions for things to be adjusted and set in order; but do\nnot withdraw from the work of God, and prove unfaithful, because\nothers are not doing right.\nRead carefully the third chapter of Malachi and see what God\nsays about the tithe. If our churches will take their stand upon the\nLord\u2019s word and be faithful in paying their tithe into His treasury,\nmore laborers will be encouraged to take up ministerial work. More\nmen would give themselves to the ministry were they not told of\nthe depleted treasury. There should be an abundant supply in the\nLord\u2019s treasury, and there would be if selfish hearts and hands had\nnot withheld the tithes or made use of them to support other lines of\nwork.\nGod\u2019s reserved resources are to be used in no such haphazard\nway. The tithe is the Lord\u2019s, and those who meddle with it will be [250]\npunished with the loss of their heavenly treasure unless they repent.\nLet the work no longer be hedged up because the tithe has been\ndiverted into various channels other than the one to which the Lord\nhas said it should go. Provision is to be made for these other lines of\n216 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nwork. They are to be sustained, but not from the tithe. God has not\nchanged; the tithe is still to be used for the support of the ministry.\nThe opening of new fields requires more ministerial efficiency than\nwe now have, and there must be means in the treasury.\nThose who go forth as ministers have a solemn responsibility\ndevolving upon them which is strangely neglected. Some enjoy\npreaching, but they do not give personal labor to the churches. There\nis great need of instruction concerning the obligations and duties to\nGod, especially in regard to paying an honest tithe. Our ministers\nwould feel sadly aggrieved if they were not promptly paid for their\nlabor; but will they consider that there must be meat in the treasure\nhouse of God wherewith to sustain the laborers? If they fail to do\ntheir whole duty in educating the people to be faithful in paying to\nGod His own, there will be a shortage of means in the treasury to\ncarry forward the Lord\u2019s work.\nThe overseer of the flock of God should faithfully discharge his\nduty. If he takes the position that because this is not pleasant to him,\nhe will leave it for someone else to do, he is not a faithful worker.\nLet him read in Malachi the words of the Lord charging the people\nwith robbery toward God in withholding the tithes. The mighty\nGod declares: \u201cYe are cursed with a curse.\u201d Malachi 3:9. When the\none who ministers in word and doctrine sees the people pursuing a\ncourse that will bring this curse upon them, how can he neglect his\nduty to give them instruction and warning? Every church member[251]\nshould be taught to be faithful in paying an honest tithe.\n\u201cBring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be\nmeat in Mine house, and prove Me now here with, saith the Lord of\nhosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you\nout a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.\u201d\nVerse 10.\n* * * * *\nI pray that my brethren may realize that the third angel\u2019s message\nmeans much to us and that the observance of the true Sabbath is to\nbe the sign that distinguishes those who serve God from those who\nserve Him not. Let those who have become sleepy and indifferent,\nawake. We are called to be holy, and we should carefully avoid\nFaithful Stewardship 217\ngiving the impression that it is of little consequence whether or not\nwe retain the peculiar features of our faith. Upon us rests the golden\nobligation of taking a more decided stand for truth and righteousness\nthan we have taken in the past. The line of demarcation between\nthose who keep the commandments of God and those who do not is\nto be revealed with unmistakable clearness. We are conscientiously\nto honor God, diligently using every means of keeping in covenant\nrelation with Him, that we may receive His blessings\u2014the blessings\nso essential for a people who are to be so severely tried. To give the\nimpression that our faith, our religion, is not a dominating power\nin our lives is greatly to dishonor God. Thus we turn from His\ncommandments, which are our life, denying that He is our God and\nwe His people.\n\u201cThe Lord thy God, He is God, the faithful God, which keepeth\ncovenant and mercy with them that love Him and keep His com- [252]\nmandments to a thousand generations; and repayeth them that hate\nHim to their face, to destroy them: He will not be slack to him that\nhateth Him, He will repay him to his face.\u201d Deuteronomy 7:9, 10.\nWhere shall we be before the thousand generations mentioned\nin this scripture are ended? Our fate will have been decided for\neternity. Either we shall have been pronounced worthy of a home in\nthe everlasting kingdom of God or we shall have received sentence\nof eternal death. Those who have been true and faithful to their\ncovenant with God; those who, remembering Calvary, have stood\nfirmly on the side of truth, ever striving to honor God, will hear the\ncommendation: \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant.\u201d But those\nwho have given God only halfhearted service, allowing their lives to\nbe conformed to the ways and practices of the world, will hear the\nsad words: \u201cDepart from Me; I know you not.\u201d\nChapter 31\u2014Beneficence[253]\n\u201cHonor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of\nall thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy\npresses shall burst out with new wine.\u201d Proverbs 3:9, 10.\n\u201cThere is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that\nwithholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal\nsoul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also\nhimself.\u201d Proverbs 11:24, 25.\n\u201cThe liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall\nhe stand.\u201d Isaiah 32:8.\nDivine wisdom has appointed, in the plan of salvation, the law\nof action and reaction, making the work of beneficence, in all its\nbranches, twice blessed. He who gives to the needy blesses others\nand is blessed himself in a still greater degree.\nThe Glory of the Gospel\nThat man might not lose the blessed results of benevolence, our\nRedeemer formed the plan of enlisting him as His co-worker. God\ncould have reached His object in saving sinners without the aid of\nman, but He knew that man could not be happy without acting a\npart in the great work. By a chain of circumstances which would\ncall forth his charities, He bestows upon man the best means of\ncultivating benevolence, and keeps him habitually giving to help the\npoor and to advance His cause. By its necessities a ruined world is\ndrawing forth from us talents of means and of influence, to present\nto men and women the truth, of which they are in perishing need.\nAnd as we heed these calls, by labor and by acts of benevolence, we[254]\nare assimilated to the image of Him who for our sakes became poor.\nIn bestowing we bless others and thus accumulate true riches.\nIt is the glory of the gospel that it is founded upon the principle\nof restoring in the fallen race the divine image by a constant mani-\nfestation of benevolence. This work began in the heavenly courts.\n218\nBeneficence 219\nThere God gave to human beings an unmistakable evidence of the\nlove with which He regarded them. He \u201cso loved the world, that He\ngave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should\nnot perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d John 3:16. The gift of Christ\nreveals the Father\u2019s heart. It testifies that, having undertaken our\nredemption, He will spare nothing, however dear, which is necessary\nto the completion of His work.\nThe spirit of liberality is the spirit of heaven. Christ\u2019s self-\nsacrificing love is revealed upon the cross. That man might be saved,\nHe gave all that He had and then gave Himself. The cross of Christ\nappeals to the benevolence of every follower of the blessed Saviour.\nThe principle there illustrated is to give, give. This, carried out in\nactual benevolence and good works, is the true fruit of the Christian\nlife. The principle of worldlings is to get, get, and thus they expect\nto secure happiness; but carried out in all its bearings, the fruit is\nmisery and death.\nThe light of the gospel shining from the cross of Christ rebukes\nselfishness and encourages liberality and benevolence. It should not\nbe a lamented fact that there are increasing calls to give. God in His\nprovidence is calling His people out from their limited sphere of ac-\ntion, to enter upon greater enterprises. Unlimited effort is demanded\nat this time when moral darkness is covering the world. Many of\nGod\u2019s people are in danger of being ensnared by worldliness and [255]\ncovetousness. They should understand that it is His mercy that mul-\ntiplies the demands for their means. Objects that call benevolence\ninto action must be placed before them, or they cannot pattern after\nthe character of the great Exemplar.\nThe Blessings of Stewardship\nIn commissioning His disciples to go \u201cinto all the world, and\npreach the gospel to every creature,\u201d Christ assigned to men the work\nof extending the knowledge of His grace. But while some go forth\nto preach, He calls upon others to answer His claims upon them\nfor offerings with which to support His cause in the earth. He has\nplaced means in the hands of men, that His divine gifts may flow\nthrough human channels in doing the work appointed us in saving\nour fellow men. This is one of God\u2019s ways of exalting man. It is just\n220 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthe work that man needs, for it will stir the deepest sympathies of\nhis heart and call into exercise the highest capabilities of the mind.\nEvery good thing of earth was placed here by the bountiful hand\nof God as an expression of His love to man. The poor are His, and\nthe cause of religion is His. The gold and the silver are the Lord\u2019s,\nand He could rain them from heaven if He chose. But instead of this\nHe has made man His steward, entrusting him with means, not to\nbe hoarded, but to be used in benefiting others. He thus makes man\nthe medium through which to distribute His blessings on earth. God\nplanned the system of beneficence in order that man might become\nlike his Creator, benevolent and unselfish in character, and finally be\na partaker with Christ of the eternal, glorious reward.\nMeeting Around the Cross[256]\nThe love expressed on Calvary should be revived, strengthened,\nand diffused among our churches. Shall we not do all we can to\ngive power to the principles which Christ brought to this world?\nShall we not strive to establish and give efficiency to the benevolent\nenterprises which are now called for without delay? As you stand\nbefore the cross and see the Prince of heaven dying for you, can you\nseal your heart, saying: \u201cNo; I have nothing to give\u201d?\nChrist\u2019s believing people are to perpetuate His love. This love\nis to draw them together around the cross. It is to divest them of all\nselfishness and bind them to God and to one another.\nMeet around the cross of Calvary in self-sacrifice and self-denial.\nGod will bless you as you do your best. As you approach the throne\nof grace, as you find yourself bound to this throne by the golden\nchain let down from heaven to earth to draw men from the pit of sin,\nyour heart will go out in love for your brethren and sisters who are\nwithout God and without hope in the world.\nChapter 32\u2014The Spirit of Independence [257]\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the General Conference,\nWashington, D. C., May 30, 1909.]\nBefore leaving Australia, and since coming to this country, I\nhave been instructed that there is a great work to be done in America.\nThose who were in the work at the beginning are passing away. Only\na few of the pioneers of the cause now remain among us. Many of\nthe heavy burdens formerly borne by men of long experience are\nnow falling upon younger men.\nThis transfer of responsibilities to laborers whose experience is\nmore or less limited is attended with some dangers against which we\nneed to guard. The world is filled with strife for the supremacy. The\nspirit of pulling away from fellow laborers, the spirit of disorganiza-\ntion, is in the very air we breathe. By some, all efforts to establish\norder are regarded as dangerous\u2014as a restriction of personal liberty,\nand hence to be feared as popery. These deceived souls regard it\na virtue to boast of their freedom to think and act independently.\nThey declare that they will not take any man\u2019s say-so, that they are\namenable to no man. I have been instructed that it is Satan\u2019s special\neffort to lead men to feel that God is pleased to have them choose\ntheir own course independent of the counsel of their brethren.\nHerein lies a grave danger to the prosperity of our work. We\nmust move discreetly, sensibly, in harmony with the judgment of\nGod-fearing counselors; for in this course alone lies our safety and\nstrength. Otherwise God cannot work with us and by us and for us.\nOh, how Satan would rejoice if he could succeed in his efforts to\nget in among this people and disorganize the work at a time when [258]\nthorough organization is essential and will be the greatest power to\nkeep out spurious uprisings and to refute claims not endorsed by the\nword of God! We want to hold the lines evenly, that there shall be\nno breaking down of the system of organization and order that has\n221\n222 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nbeen built up by wise, careful labor. License must not be given to\ndisorderly elements that desire to control the work at this time.\nSome have advanced the thought that, as we near the close of\ntime, every child of God will act independently of any religious\norganization. But I have been instructed by the Lord that in this\nwork there is no such thing as every man\u2019s being independent. The\nstars of heaven are all under law, each influencing the other to do\nthe will of God, yielding their common obedience to the law that\ncontrols their action. And, in order that the Lord\u2019s work may advance\nhealthfully and solidly, His people must draw together.\nThe spasmodic, fitful movements of some who claim to be Chris-\ntians are well represented by the work of strong but untrained horses.\nWhen one pulls forward, another pulls back, and at the voice of their\nmaster one plunges ahead and the other stands immovable. If men\nwill not move in concert in the great and grand work for this time,\nthere will be confusion. It is not a good sign when men refuse to\nunite with their brethren and prefer to act alone. Let laborers take\ninto their confidence the brethren who are free to point out every\ndeparture from right principles. If men wear the yoke of Christ, they\ncan not pull apart; they will draw with Christ.\nSome workers pull with all the power that God has given them,\nbut they have not yet learned that they should not pull alone. Instead\nof isolating themselves, let them draw in harmony with their fellow[259]\nlaborers. Unless they do this, their activity will work at the wrong\ntime and in the wrong way. They will often work counter to that\nwhich God would have done, and thus their work is worse than\nwasted.\nUnity in Diversity\nOn the other hand, the leaders among God\u2019s people are to guard\nagainst the danger of condemning the methods of individual workers\nwho are led by the Lord to do a special work that but few are fitted\nto do. Let brethren in responsibility be slow to criticize movements\nthat are not in perfect harmony with their methods of labor. Let them\nnever suppose that every plan should reflect their own personality.\nLet them not fear to trust another\u2019s methods; for by withholding\ntheir confidence from a brother laborer who, with humility and\nSpirit of Independence 223\nconsecrated zeal, is doing a special work in God\u2019s appointed way,\nthey are retarding the advancement of the Lord\u2019s cause.\nGod can and will use those who have not had a thorough edu-\ncation in the schools of men. A doubt of His power to do this is\nmanifest unbelief; it is limiting the omnipotent power of the One\nwith whom nothing is impossible. Oh, for less of this uncalled-for,\ndistrustful caution! It leaves so many forces of the church unused; it\ncloses up the way so that the Holy Spirit cannot use men; it keeps in\nidleness those who are willing and anxious to labor in Christ\u2019s lines;\nit discourages from entering the work many who would become\nefficient laborers together with God if they were given a fair chance.\nTo the prophet the wheel within a wheel, the appearance of living\ncreatures connected with them, all seemed intricate and unexplain- [260]\nable. But the hand of Infinite Wisdom is seen among the wheels,\nand perfect order is the result of its work. Every wheel, directed\nby the hand of God, works in perfect harmony with every other\nwheel. I have been shown that human instrumentalities are liable to\nseek after too much power and try to control the work themselves.\nThey leave the Lord God, the Mighty Worker, too much out of their\nmethods and plans, and do not trust to Him everything in regard to\nthe advancement of the work. No one should for a moment fancy\nthat he is able to manage those things that belong to the great I AM.\nGod in His providence is preparing a way so that the work may be\ndone by human agents. Then let every man stand at his post of duty,\nto act his part for this time and know that God is his instructor.\nThe General Conference\nI have often been instructed by the Lord that no man\u2019s judg-\nment should be surrendered to the judgment of any other one man.\nNever should the mind of one man or the minds of a few men be\nregarded as sufficient in wisdom and power to control the work and\nto say what plans shall be followed. But when, in a General Con-\nference, the judgment of the brethren assembled from all parts of\nthe field is exercised, private independence and private judgment\nmust not be stubbornly maintained, but surrendered. Never should a\nlaborer regard as a virtue the persistent maintenance of his position\nof independence, contrary to the decision of the general body.\n224 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nAt times, when a small group of men entrusted with the general\nmanagement of the work have, in the name of the General Confer-\nence, sought to carry out unwise plans and to restrict God\u2019s work,[261]\nI have said that I could no longer regard the voice of the General\nConference, represented by these few men, as the voice of God. But\nthis is not saying that the decisions of a General Conference com-\nposed of an assembly of duly appointed, representative men from\nall parts of the field should not be respected. God has ordained that\nthe representatives of His church from all parts of the earth, when\nassembled in a General Conference, shall have authority. The error\nthat some are in danger of committing is in giving to the mind and\njudgment of one man, or of a small group of men, the full measure\nof authority and influence that God has vested in His church in the\njudgment and voice of the General Conference assembled to plan\nfor the prosperity and advancement of His work.\nWhen this power, which God has placed in the church, is ac-\ncredited wholly to one man, and he is invested with the authority to\nbe judgment for other minds, then the true Bible order is changed.\nSatan\u2019s efforts upon such a man\u2019s mind would be most subtle and\nsometimes well-nigh overpowering, for the enemy would hope that\nthrough his mind he could affect many others. Let us give to the\nhighest organized authority in the church that which we are prone to\ngive to one man or to a small group of men.\nChapter 33\u2014A Distribution of Responsibility [262]\n[Manuscript read before the delegates at the General Conference,\nWashington, D.C., May 30, 1909.]\nGod would have His people an understanding people. He has\nso arranged matters that chosen men shall go as delegates to our\nconferences. These men are to be tried and proved. They are to be\ntrustworthy men. The choosing of delegates to attend our confer-\nences is an important matter. These men are to lay the plans that\nshall be followed in the advancement of the work; and therefore they\nare to be men of understanding, able to reason from cause to effect.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the\npeople: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the\nevening. And when Moses\u2019 father-in-law saw all that he did to the\npeople, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people?\nwhy sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from\nmorning unto even? And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because\nthe people come unto me to inquire of God: when they have a matter,\nthey come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do\nmake them know the statutes of God, and His laws. And Moses\u2019\nfather-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.\nThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with\nthee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform\nit thyself alone. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel,\nand God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to Godward, that\nthou mayest bring the causes unto God: and thou shalt teach them\nordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they\nmust walk, and the work that they must do. Moreover thou shalt [263]\nprovide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of\ntruth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers\nof thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of\ntens: and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,\nthat every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small\n225\n226 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nmatter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they\nshall bear the burden with thee.\n\u201cIf thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou\nshalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place\nin peace.\n\u201cSo Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did\nall that he had said. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel,\nand made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of\nhundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they judged the\npeople at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but\nevery small matter they judged themselves.\u201d Exodus 18:13-26.\nIn the first chapter of Acts, also, instruction is given regarding the\nchoosing of men to bear responsibilities in the church. The apostasy\nof Judas had left one place vacant in the ranks of the apostles, and it\nwas necessary that another be chosen to take this place. Speaking of\nthis, Peter said:\n\u201cWherefore of these men which have companied with us all the\ntime that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from\nthe baptism of John, unto that same day that He was taken up from\nus, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of His resurrection.\nAnd they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed\nJustus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which[264]\nknowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two Thou hast\nchosen, that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from\nwhich Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.\nAnd they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he\nwas numbered with the eleven apostles.\u201d Acts 1:21-26.\nFrom these scriptures we learn that the Lord has certain men to\nfill certain positions. God will teach His people to move carefully\nand to make wise choice of men who will not betray sacred trusts.\nIf in Christ\u2019s day the believers needed to be guarded in their choice\nof men for positions of responsibility, we who are living in this time\ncertainly need to move with great discretion. We are to present every\ncase before God and in earnest prayer ask Him to choose for us.\nThe Lord God of heaven has chosen experienced men to bear\nresponsibilities in His cause. These men are to have special influ-\nence. If all are accorded the power given to these chosen men, a halt\nwill have to be called. Those who are chosen to bear burdens in the\nDistribution of Responsibility 227\nwork of God are not to be rash or self-confident or selfish. Never is\ntheir example or influence to strengthen evil. The Lord has not given\nmen or women liberty to advance ideas that will bring commonness\ninto His work, removing the sacredness that should ever surround it.\nGod\u2019s work is to become increasingly sacred to His people. In every\nway we are to magnify the exalted character of the truth. Those who\nhave been set as guardians of the work of God in our institutions are\never to make the will and way of God prominent. The health of the\ngeneral work depends upon the faithfulness of the men appointed to\ncarry out the will of God in the churches.\nMen must be placed in charge who will obtain an enlarged expe- [265]\nrience, not in the things of self, but in the things of God, an enlarged\nknowledge of the character of Christ. The more they know of Christ,\nthe more faithfully they represent Him to the world. They are to\nlisten to His voice and give heed to His words.\nA Warning\nThen began He to upbraid the cities wherein most of His mighty\nworks were done, because they repented not: Woe unto thee,\nChorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which\nwere done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would\nhave repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say unto you,\nIt shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment,\nthan for you.\n\u201cAnd thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be\nbrought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done\nin thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this\nday. But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land\nof Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.\n\u201cAt that time Jesus answered and said, I thank Thee, O Father,\nLord of heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from\nthe wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even\nso, Father: for so it seemed good in Thy sight. All things are\ndelivered unto Me of My Father: and no man knoweth the Son, but\nthe Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and\nhe to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him.\n228 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\n\u201cCome unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy-laden, and I will\ngive you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am\nmeek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For[266]\nMy yoke is easy, and My burden is light.\u201d Matthew 11:20-30.\nIt is always safe to be meek and lowly and tenderhearted, but\nat the same time we are to be as firm as a rock to the teachings of\nChrist. His words of instruction are to be strictly heeded. Not one\nword is to be lost sight of. The truth will abide forever. We are not\nto place our trust in any lie or pretense. Those who do this will find\nthat it has been done at the loss of eternal life. We are now to make\nstraight paths for our feet, lest the lame be turned out of the way.\nWhen the lame are turned from safe paths, who is accountable but\nthose who have misled them? They have set at nought the counsel\nof the One whose words are life eternal, for the works of deception\noriginating with the father of lies.\nI have words for all who may suppose that they are safe in\nobtaining their education in Battle Creek. The Lord has blotted out\ntwo of our largest institutions that were established in Battle Creek,\nand has given warning after warning, even as Christ gave warning\nto Bethsaida and Capernaum. There is a necessity of giving earnest\nattention to every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.\nThere can be no sinless departure from the words of Christ. The\nSaviour urges the erring ones to repent. Those who humble their\nhearts and confess their sins will be pardoned. Their transgressions\nwill be forgiven. But the man who thinks that should he confess\nhis sins he would show weakness, will not find pardon, will not\nsee Christ as his Redeemer, but will go on and on in transgression,\nmaking blunder after blunder and adding sin to sin. What will such a\none do in the day that the books are opened and every man is judged\naccording to the things written in the books?\nThe fifth chapter of Revelation needs to be closely studied. It is[267]\nof great importance to those who shall act a part in the work of God\nfor these last days. There are some who are deceived. They do not\nrealize what is coming on the earth. Those who have permitted their\nminds to become beclouded in regard to what constitutes sin are\nfearfully deceived. Unless they make a decided change they will be\nfound wanting when God pronounces judgment upon the children\nDistribution of Responsibility 229\nof men. They have transgressed the law and broken the everlasting\ncovenant, and they will receive according to their works.\n\u201cAnd I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there\nwas a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of\nhair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto\nthe earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is\nshaken of a mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when\nit is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out\nof their places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and\nthe rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every\nbondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the\nrocks of the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on\nus, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and\nfrom the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of His wrath is come;\nand who shall be able to stand?\u201d Revelation 6:12-17.\n\u201cAfter this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man\ncould number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues,\nstood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white\nrobes, and palms in their hands; and cried with a loud voice, saying,\nSalvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the\nLamb.... These are they which came out of great tribulation, and [268]\nhave washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the\nLamb. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him\nday and night in His temple: and He that sitteth on the throne shall\ndwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any\nmore; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. For the Lamb\nwhich is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead\nthem unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all\ntears from their eyes.\u201d Revelation 7:9-17.\nIn these scriptures two parties are brought to view. One party\npermitted themselves to be deceived and took sides with those with\nwhom the Lord has a controversy. They misinterpreted the messages\nsent them and clothed themselves in robes of self-righteousness. Sin\nwas not sinful in their eyes. They taught falsehood as truth, and by\nthem many souls were led astray.\nWe need now to take heed to ourselves. Warnings have been\ngiven. Can we not see the fulfillment of the predictions made by\nChrist and recorded in the twenty-first chapter of Luke? How many\n230 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nare studying the words of Christ? How many are deceiving their\nown souls and cheating themselves out of the blessings that others\nmight secure if they would believe and obey? Probation still lingers,\nand it is our privilege to lay hold of the hope set before us in the\ngospel. Let us repent and be converted and forsake our sins, that\nthey may be blotted out. \u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away: but My\nwords shall not pass away. And take heed to yourselves, lest at any\ntime your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness,\nand cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares. For\nas a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the[269]\nwhole earth. Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be\naccounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass,\nand to stand before the Son of man.\u201d Luke 21:33-36.\nShall the warnings given by Christ be passed by unheeded?\nShall we not make diligent work for repentance now, while Mercy\u2019s\ngracious voice is still heard?\n\u201cWatch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth\ncome. But know this, that if the good man of the house had known\nin what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and\nwould not have suffered his house to be broken up. Therefore be\nye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man\ncometh. Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord hath\nmade ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?\nBlessed is that servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so\ndoing. Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all\nhis goods. But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord\ndelayeth his coming; and shall begin to smite his fellow servants,\nand to eat and drink with the drunken; the Lord of that servant shall\ncome in a day when he looketh not for him, and in an hour that he is\nnot aware of, and shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion\nwith the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d\nMatthew 24:42-51.\nChapter 34\u2014In Humility and Faith [270]\n[Read at the Los Angeles, California, camp meeting, August 15-31,\n1907, and afterward published in the tract, Jehovah is Our King.]\nSpecial instruction has been given me for God\u2019s people, for\nperilous times are upon us. In the world, destruction and violence\nare increasing. In the church, man power is gaining the ascendancy;\nthose who have been chosen to occupy positions of trust think it\ntheir prerogative to rule.\nMen whom the Lord calls to important positions in His work are\nto cultivate a humble dependence upon Him. They are not to seek to\nembrace too much authority; for God has not called them to a work\nof ruling, but to plan and counsel with their fellow laborers. Every\nworker alike is to hold himself amenable to the requirements and\ninstructions of God.\nWise Counselors\nBecause of the importance of the work in Southern California\nand the perplexities which now surround it, there should be selected\nno less than five men of wisdom and experience to consult with the\npresidents of the local and union conferences regarding general plans\nand policies. The Lord is not pleased with the disposition some have\nmanifested to rule those of more experience than themselves. By\nthis course of action some have revealed that they are not qualified\nto fill the important positions which they occupy. Any human being\nwho spreads himself out to large proportions and who seeks to have\nthe control of his fellows, proves himself to be a dangerous man to\nbe entrusted with religious responsibilities.\nLet no one cling to the idea that unless money is in hand, no [271]\nmove should be made that calls for the investment of means. If\nin our past experience we had always followed this method, we\nwould often have lost special advantages, such as we gained in the\n231\n232 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\npurchase of the Fernando school property and in the purchase of the\nsanitarium properties at Paradise Valley, Glendale, and Loma Linda.\nGo Forward\nTo make no move that calls for the investment of means unless\nwe have the money in hand to complete the contemplated work\nshould not always be considered the wisest plan. In the upbuilding\nof His work the Lord does not always make everything plain before\nHis servants. He sometimes tries the confidence of His people by\nhaving them move forward in faith. Often He brings them into strait\nand trying places, bidding them go forward when their feet seem to\nbe touching the waters of the Red Sea. It is at such times, when the\nprayers of His servants ascend to Him in earnest faith, that He opens\nthe way before them and brings them out into a large place.\nThe Lord wants His people in these days to believe that He will\ndo as great things for them as He did for the children of Israel in their\njourney from Egypt to Canaan. We are to have an educated faith\nthat will not hesitate to follow His instructions in the most difficult\nexperiences. \u201cGo forward\u201d is the command of God to His people.\nFaith and cheerful obedience are needed to bring the Lord\u2019s\ndesigns to pass. When He points out the necessity of establishing\nthe work in places where it will have influence, the people are to walk\nand work by faith. By their godly conversation, their humility, their[272]\nprayers and earnest efforts, they should strive to bring the people to\nappreciate the good work that the Lord has established among them.\nIt was the Lord\u2019s purpose that the Loma Linda Sanitarium should\nbecome the property of our people, and He brought it about at a time\nwhen the rivers of difficulty were full and overflowing their banks.\nThe working of private interests for the gaining of personal ends\nis one thing. In this, men may follow their own judgment. But\nthe carrying forward of the Lord\u2019s work in the earth is entirely\nanother matter. When He designates that a certain property should\nbe secured for the advancement of His cause and the building up of\nHis work, whether it be for sanitarium or school work, or for any\nother branch, He will make the doing of that work possible if those\nwho have experience will show their faith and trust in His purposes,\nand will move forward promptly to secure the advantages He points\nIn Humility and Faith 233\nout. While we are not to seek to wrest property from any man, yet\nwhen advantages are offered, we should be wide awake to see the\nadvantage, that we may make plans for the upbuilding of the work.\nAnd when we have done this we should exert every energy to secure\nthe freewill offerings of God\u2019s people for the support of these new\nplants.\nOften the Lord sees that His workers are in doubt as to what\nthey should do. At such times, if they will put their confidence in\nHim, He will reveal to them His will. God\u2019s work is now to advance\nrapidly, and if His people will respond to His call, He will make\nthe possessors of property willing to donate of their means and thus\nmake it possible for His work to be accomplished in the earth. \u201cFaith [273]\nis the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d\nHebrews 11:1. Faith in the word of God will place His people in\nthe possession of property which will enable them to work the large\ncities that are waiting for the message of truth.\nThe cold, formal, unbelieving way in which some of the laborers\ndo their work is a deep offense to the Spirit of God. The apostle Paul\nsays: \u201cDo all things without murmurings and disputings: that ye\nmay be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in\nthe midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as\nlights in the world; holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice\nin the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in\nvain. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your\nfaith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.\u201d Philippians 2:14-17.\nWe are to encourage in one another that living faith which Christ\nhas made it possible for every believer to have. The work is to be\ncarried forward as the Lord prepares the way. When He brings His\npeople into strait places, then it is their privilege to assemble together\nfor prayer, remembering that all things come of God. Those who\nhave not yet shared in the trying experiences that attend the work\nin these last days will soon have to pass through scenes that will\nseverely test their confidence in God. It is at the time His people\nsee no way to advance, when the Red Sea is before them and the\npursuing army behind, that God bids them: \u201cGo forward.\u201d Thus\nHe is working to test their faith. When such experiences come to\nyou, go forward, trusting in Christ. Walk step by step in the path\nHe marks out. Trials will come, but go forward. This will give you\n234 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nan experience that will strengthen your faith in God and fit you for\ntruest service.\nThe Example of Christ[274]\nA deeper and wider experience in religious things is to come\nto God\u2019s people. Christ is our example. If through living faith and\nsanctified obedience to God\u2019s word we reveal the love and grace of\nChrist, if we show that we have a true conception of God\u2019s guiding\nprovidences in the work, we shall carry to the world a convincing\npower. A high position does not give us value in the sight of God.\nMan is measured by his consecration and faithfulness in working\nout the will of God. If the remnant people of God will walk before\nHim in humility and faith, He will carry out through them His\neternal purpose, enabling them to work harmoniously in giving to\nthe world the truth as it is in Jesus. He will use all\u2014men, women,\nand children\u2014in making the light shine forth to the world and calling\nout a people that will be true to His commandments. Through the\nfaith that His people exercise in Him, God will make known to the\nworld that He is the true God, the God of Israel.\n\u201cLet your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ,\u201d\nthe apostle Paul exhorts, \u201cthat whether I come and see you, or else\nbe absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit,\nwith one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel; and in\nnothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident\ntoken of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. For unto\nyou it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him,\nbut also to suffer for His sake.\u201d\n\u201cIf there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort\nof love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,\nfulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being\nof one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or[275]\nvain-glory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than\nthemselves.\n\u201cLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on\nthe things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in\nChrist Jesus: who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery\nto be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation, and took\nIn Humility and Faith 235\nupon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of\nmen: and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and\nbecame obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore\nGod also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which\nis above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should\nbow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the\nearth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,\nto the glory of God the Father. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have\nalways obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in\nmy absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\nFor it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of His\ngood pleasure.\u201d Philippians 1:27-29; 2:1-13.\nI have been instructed to present these words to our people in\nSouthern California. They are needed in every place where a church\nis established, for a strange experience has been coming into our\nranks.\nIt is time now for men to humble their hearts before God and\nto learn to work in His ways. Let those who have sought to rule\ntheir fellow workers study to know what manner of spirit they are\nof. They should seek the Lord by fasting and prayer, and in humility\nof soul.\nChrist in His earthly life gave an example that all can safely [276]\nfollow. He appreciates His flock, and He wants no power set over\nthem that will restrict their freedom in His service. He has never\nplaced man as a ruler over His heritage. True Bible religion will lead\nto self-control, not to control of one another. As a people we need\na larger measure of the Holy Spirit, that we may bear the solemn\nmessage that God has given us, without exaltation.\nBrethren, keep your words of censure for your individual selves.\nTeach the flock of God to look to Christ, not to erring man. Every\nsoul who becomes a teacher of the truth must bear in his own life\nthe fruit of holiness. Looking to Christ and following Him, he will\npresent to the souls under his charge an example of what a living,\nlearning Christian will be. Let God teach you His way. Inquire of\nHim daily to know His will. He will give unerring counsel to all\nwho seek Him with a sincere heart. Walk worthy of the vocation\nwherewith you are called, praising God in your daily conversation\n236 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nas well as in your prayers. Thus, holding forth the word of life, you\nwill constrain other souls to become followers of Christ.\nChapter 35\u2014To the Workers in Southern California [277]\n[Published first in Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 10, Jehovah is\nOur King.]\nThis morning I cannot rest. My mind is troubled over the sit-\nuation in Southern California. God has given to every man his\nwork, but there are some who are not prayerfully considering their\nindividual responsibility.\nWhen a worker is selected for an office, that office of itself does\nnot bring to him power of capability that he did not have before. A\nhigh position does not give to the character Christian virtues. The\nman who supposes that his individual mind is capable of planning\nand devising for all branches of the work reveals a great lack of\nwisdom. No one human mind is capable of carrying the many\nand varied responsibilities of a conference embracing thousands of\npeople and many branches of work.\nBut a greater danger than this has been revealed to me in the\nfeeling that has been growing among our workers that ministers\nand other laborers in the cause should depend upon the mind of\ncertain leading workers to define their duties. One man\u2019s mind and\njudgment are not to be considered capable of controlling and molding\na conference. The individual and the church have responsibilities\nof their own. God has given to every man some talent or talents to\nuse and improve. In using these talents he increases his capability\nto serve. God has given to each individual judgment, and this gift\nHe wants His workers to use and improve. The president of a\nconference must not consider that his individual judgment is to\ncontrol the judgment of all.\nIn no conference should propositions be rushed through without [278]\ntime being taken by the brethren to weigh carefully all sides of the\nquestion. Because the president of a conference suggested certain\nplans, it has sometimes been considered unnecessary to consult the\nLord about them. Thus propositions have been accepted that were\n237\n238 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nnot for the spiritual benefit of the believers and that involved far more\nthan was apparent at the first casual consideration. Such movements\nare not in the order of God. Many, very many matters have been\ntaken up and carried by vote, that have involved far more than was\nanticipated and far more than those who voted would have been\nwilling to assent to had they taken time to consider the question\nfrom all sides.\nWe cannot at this time afford to be careless or negligent in the\nwork of God. We must seek the Lord earnestly every day if we\nwould be prepared for the experiences that come to us. Our hearts\nare to be cleansed from every feeling of superiority, and the living\nprinciples of the truth are to be planted in the soul. Young and aged\nand middle-aged should now be practicing the virtues of Christ\u2019s\ncharacter. They should daily be making spiritual development, that\nthey may become vessels unto honor in the Master\u2019s service.\n\u201cAnd it came to pass, that, as He was praying in a certain place,\nwhen He ceased, one of His disciples said unto Him, Lord, teach us\nto pray, as John also taught his disciples.\u201d Luke 11:1. The prayer that\nChrist gave to His disciples in answer to this request is not made in\nhigh-flown language, but expresses in simple words the necessities\nof the soul. It is short and deals directly with the daily needs.\nEvery soul has the privilege of stating to the Lord his own special[279]\nnecessities and to offer his individual thanksgiving for the blessings\nthat he daily receives. But the many long and spiritless, faithless\nprayers that are offered to God, instead of being a joy to Him, are a\nburden. We need, oh, so much! clean, converted hearts. We need\nto have our faith strengthened. \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you,\u201d the\nSaviour promised; \u201cseek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be\nopened unto you.\u201d Matthew 7:7. We need to educate ourselves to\ntrust in this word and to bring the light and grace of Christ into all\nour works. We need to take hold of Christ and to retain our hold\nof Him until we know that the power of His transforming grace is\nmanifested in us. We must have faith in Christ if we would reflect\nthe divine character.\nChrist clothed His divinity with humanity and lived a life of\nprayer and self-denial, and of daily battle with temptation, that He\nmight help those who today are assailed by temptation. He is our\nefficiency and power. He desires that, through the appropriation of\nTo the Workers in Southern California 239\nHis grace, humanity shall become partakers of the divine nature and\nthus escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. The\nword of God in the Old and New Testaments, if faithfully studied\nand received into the life, will give spiritual wisdom and life. This\nword is to be sacredly cherished. Faith in the word of God and in\nthe power of Christ to transform the life will enable the believer to\nwork His works and to live a life of rejoicing in the Lord.\nAgain and again I have been instructed to say to our people: Let\nyour faith and trust be in God. Do not depend on any erring man\nto define your duty. It is your privilege to say: \u201cI will declare Thy\nname unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise\nThee. Ye that fear the Lord, praise Him; all ye the seed of Jacob, [280]\nglorify Him; and fear Him, all ye the seed of Israel. For He hath not\ndespised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath He\nhid His face from him; but when he cried unto Him, He heard. My\npraise shall be of Thee: ... I will pay my vows before them that fear\nHim. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the Lord\nthat seek Him: your heart shall live forever.\u201d Psalm 22:22-26.\nThese scriptures are right to the point. Every church member\nshould understand that God is the one to whom to look for an under-\nstanding of individual duty. It is right that brethren counsel together;\nbut when men arrange just what their brethren shall do, let them\nanswer that they have chosen the Lord as their counselor. Those who\nwill humbly seek Him will find His grace sufficient. But when one\nman allows another to step in between him and the duty that God\nhas pointed out to him, giving to man his confidence and accepting\nhim as guide, then he steps from the true platform to a false and\ndangerous one. Such a man, instead of growing and developing, will\nlose his spirituality.\nThere is no power in any man to remedy the defective character.\nIndividually our hope and trust must be in One who is more than\nhuman. We need ever to remember that help has been laid on One\nwho is mighty. The Lord has provided the needed help for every\nsoul who will accept it.\nSanitarium, California,\nOctober 3, 1907.\nChapter 36\u2014\u201cI Am But a Little Child\u201d[281]\n[Published first in Special Testimonies, Series B, No. 10, Jehovah is\nOur King.]\nAt the beginning of his reign Solomon prayed: \u201cO Lord my God,\nThou hast made Thy servant king instead of David my father: and I\nam but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in.\u201d 1 Kings\n3:7.\nSolomon had succeeded his father David to the throne of Israel.\nGod greatly honored him, and, as we know, he became in later years\nthe greatest, richest, and wisest king that had ever sat upon an earthly\nthrone. Early in his reign Solomon was impressed by the Holy Spirit\nwith the solemnity of his responsibilities, and, though rich in talents\nand ability, he realized that without divine aid he was helpless as a\nlittle child to perform them. Solomon was never so rich or so wise\nor so truly great as when he confessed to the Lord: \u201cI am but a little\nchild: I know not how to go out or come in.\u201d\nIt was in a dream, in which the Lord appeared to him, saying,\n\u201cAsk what I shall give thee\u201d (verse 5), that Solomon thus gave\nexpression to his feeling of helplessness and need of divine aid. He\ncontinued: \u201cThy servant is in the midst of Thy people which Thou\nhast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted\nfor multitude. Give therefore Thy servant an understanding heart\nto judge Thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for\nwho is able to judge this Thy so great a people?\n\u201cAnd the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this\nthing. And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing,\nand hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches\nfor thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked[282]\nfor thyself understanding to discern judgment; behold, I have done\naccording to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an under-\nstanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither\nafter thee shall any arise like unto thee. And I have also given thee\n240\n\u201cI Am But a Little Child\u201d 241\nthat which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honor: so that there\nshall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.\u201d Now\nthe conditions: \u201cAnd if thou wilt walk in My ways, to keep My\nstatutes and My commandments, as thy father David did walk, then\nI will lengthen thy days.\n\u201cAnd Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he\ncame to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the\nLord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings,\nand made a feast to all his servants.\u201d Verses 8-15.\nAll who occupy responsible positions need to learn the lesson\nthat is taught in Solomon\u2019s humble prayer. They are ever to re-\nmember that position will never change the character or render man\ninfallible. The higher the position a man occupies, the greater the\nresponsibility he has to bear, the wider will be the influence he exerts\nand the greater his need to feel his dependence on the wisdom and\nstrength of God and to cultivate the best and most holy character.\nThose who accept a position of responsibility in the cause of God\nshould always remember that with the call to this work God has also\ncalled them to walk circumspectly before Him and before their fel-\nlow men. Instead of considering it their duty to order and dictate and\ncommand, they should realize that they are to be learners themselves.\nWhen a responsible worker fails to learn this lesson, the sooner he is\nreleased from his responsibilities the better it will be for him and for\nthe work of God. Position never will give holiness and excellence [283]\nof character. He who honors God and keeps His commandments is\nhimself honored.\nThe question which each should ask himself in all humility is:\n\u201cAm I qualified for this position? Have I learned to keep the way of\nthe Lord to do justice and judgment?\u201d The Saviour\u2019s earthly example\nhas been given us that we should not walk in our own strength, but\nthat each should consider himself, as Solomon expressed it, \u201ca little\nchild.\u201d\n\u201cFollowers of God, as Dear Children\u201d\nEvery truly converted soul can say: \u201cI am but a little child; but\nI am God\u2019s child.\u201d It was at infinite cost that provision was made\nwhereby the human family might be restored to sonship with God. In\n242 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nthe beginning, God made man in His own likeness. Our first parents\nlistened to the voice of the tempter and yielded to the power of Satan.\nBut man was not abandoned to the results of the evil he had chosen.\nThe promise of a Deliverer was given. \u201cI will put enmity between\nthee and the woman,\u201d God said to the serpent, \u201cand between thy\nseed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his\nheel.\u201d Genesis 3:15. Before they heard of the thorn and the thistle,\nof the sorrow and toil that must be their portion, or of the dust to\nwhich they must return, they listened to words that could not fail of\ngiving them hope. All that had been lost by yielding to Satan could\nbe regained through Christ.\nThe Son of God was given to redeem the race. At infinite suffer-\ning, the sinless for the sinful, the price was paid that was to redeem\nthe human family from the power of the destroyer and restore them\nagain to the image of God. Those who accept the salvation brought[284]\nto them in Christ will humble themselves before God as His little\nchildren.\nGod wants His children to ask for those things that will enable\nHim to reveal His grace through them to the world. He wants them\nto seek His counsel, to acknowledge His power. Christ lays loving\nclaims on all for whom He has given His life; they are to obey His\nwill if they would share the joys that He has prepared for all who\nreflect His character here. It is well for us to feel our weakness, for\nthen we shall seek the strength and wisdom that the Father delights\nto give to His children for their daily strife against the powers of\nevil.\n* * * * *\nWhile education, training, and the counsel of those of experience\nare all essential, the workers are to be taught that they are not to\nrely wholly upon any man\u2019s judgment. As God\u2019s free agents, all\nshould ask wisdom of Him. When the learner depends wholly upon\nanother\u2019s thoughts, accepting his plans and going no further, he sees\nonly through that man\u2019s eyes and is, so far, only an echo of another.\nChapter 37\u2014The Reward of Earnest Effort [285]\n\u201cIf any man\u2019s work abide, ... he shall receive a reward.\u201d 1\nCorinthians 3:14. Glorious will be the reward bestowed when the\nfaithful workers gather about the throne of God and of the Lamb.\nWhen John in his mortal state beheld the glory of God, he fell as one\ndead; he was not able to endure the sight. But when the children of\nGod shall have put on immortality, they will \u201csee Him as He is.\u201d 1\nJohn 3:2. They will stand before the throne, accepted in the Beloved.\nAll their sins have been blotted out, all their transgressions borne\naway. Now they can look upon the undimmed glory of the throne of\nGod. They have been partakers with Christ in His sufferings, they\nhave been workers together with Him in the plan of redemption, and\nthey are partakers with Him in the joy of seeing souls saved in the\nkingdom of God, there to praise God through all eternity.\nMy brother, my sister, I urge you to prepare for the coming\nof Christ in the clouds of heaven. Day by day cast the love of\nthe world out of your hearts. Understand by experience what it\nmeans to have fellowship with Christ. Prepare for the judgment, that\nwhen Christ shall come, to be admired in all them that believe, you\nmay be among those who will meet Him in peace. In that day the\nredeemed will shine forth in the glory of the Father and the Son. The\nangels, touching their golden harps, will welcome the King and His\ntrophies of victory\u2014those who have been washed and made white\nin the blood of the Lamb. A song of triumph will peal forth, filling\nall heaven. Christ has conquered. He enters the heavenly courts,\naccompanied by His redeemed ones, the witnesses that His mission [286]\nof suffering and sacrifice has not been in vain.\nThe resurrection and ascension of our Lord is a sure evidence\nof the triumph of the saints of God over death and the grave, and a\npledge that heaven is open to those who wash their robes of character\nand make them white in the blood of the Lamb. Jesus ascended to\nthe Father as a representative of the human race, and God will bring\nthose who reflect His image to behold and share with Him His glory.\n243\n244 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9\nThere are homes for the pilgrims of earth. There are robes for\nthe righteous, with crowns of glory and palms of victory. All that\nhas perplexed us in the providences of God will in the world to\ncome be made plain. The things hard to be understood will then find\nexplanation. The mysteries of grace will unfold before us. Where\nour finite minds discovered only confusion and broken promises, we\nshall see the most perfect and beautiful harmony. We shall know\nthat infinite love ordered the experiences that seemed most trying.\nAs we realize the tender care of Him who makes all things work\ntogether for our good, we shall rejoice with joy unspeakable and full\nof glory.\nPain cannot exist in the atmosphere of heaven. In the home of\nthe redeemed there will be no tears, no funeral trains, no badges of\nmourning. \u201cThe inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that\ndwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.\u201d Isaiah 33:24. One rich\ntide of happiness will flow and deepen as eternity rolls on.\nWe are still amidst the shadows and turmoil of earthly activities.\nLet us consider most earnestly the blessed hereafter. Let our faith\npierce through every cloud of darkness and behold Him who died\nfor the sins of the world. He has opened the gates of paradise to all [287]\nwho receive and believe on Him. To them He gives power to become\nthe sons and daughters of God. Let the afflictions which pain us so\ngrievously become instructive lessons, teaching us to press forward\ntoward the mark of the prize of our high calling in Christ. Let us be\nencouraged by the thought that the Lord is soon to come. Let this\nhope gladden our hearts. \u201cYet a little while, and He that shall come\nwill come, and will not tarry.\u201d Hebrews 10:37. Blessed are those\nservants who, when their Lord comes, shall be found watching.\nWe are homeward bound. He who loved us so much as to die\nfor us hath builded for us a city. The New Jerusalem is our place of\nrest. There will be no sadness in the city of God. No wail of sorrow,\nno dirge of crushed hopes and buried affections, will evermore be\nheard. Soon the garments of heaviness will be changed for the\nwedding garment. Soon we shall witness the coronation of our King.\nThose whose lives have been hidden with Christ, those who on this\nearth have fought the good fight of faith, will shine forth with the\nRedeemer\u2019s glory in the kingdom of God.\nReward of Earnest Effort 245\nIt will not be long till we shall see Him in whom our hopes of\neternal life are centered. And in His presence, all the trials and suf-\nferings of this life will be as nothingness. \u201cCast not away therefore\nyour confidence, which hath great recompense of reward. For ye\nhave need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye\nmight receive the promise. For yet a little while, and He that shall\ncome will come, and will not tarry.\u201d Verses 35-37. Look up, look\nup, and let your faith continually increase. Let this faith guide you\nalong the narrow path that leads through the gates of the city of God [288]\ninto the great beyond, the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for\nthe redeemed. \u201cBe patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of\nthe Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of\nthe earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and\nlatter rain. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming\nof the Lord draweth nigh.\u201d James 5:7, 8.",
