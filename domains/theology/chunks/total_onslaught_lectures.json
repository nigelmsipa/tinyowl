The presentation highlights Jesus' astounding claims, such as being \"the way, the truth, and the life\", emphasizing that he cannot simply be on par with other religious figures if his claims are true. Veith then delves into the numerous Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, demonstrating their precise fulfillment in Jesus, from his birth in Bethlehem to his miraculous works, betrayal, crucifixion, and even the division of his garments. A significant portion of the lecture focuses on Daniel's 70-week prophecy, showing how it foretells the exact timing of the Messiah's anointing and sacrifice, definitively identifying Jesus as the one who brought an \"end to sacrifice and offering\" through his death. The speaker contends that these detailed prophecies and their exact fulfillment serve as undeniable proof that Jesus is the unique and divine Savior, not \"just another man.\"\n\n## Content:\n(2) 201

thank you [Music] now this question is going to become very important Jesus imposter or Messiah it's a very important question because this Jesus lays claims to some astounding things he says for example I am the way the truth and the life how many come to the father\n\n(01:33) no one comes to the father except by me that's what he says and today this Jesus is being marginalized and the critics and especially what they call the new Reformation movement is disseminating the Bible and ripping the heart out of the Messianic side of the Bible Jesus must if we want to have World\n\n(02:09) Unity of religions become one on a level with all the others isn't that right he cannot stand out above anyone else he has to come down to the level of all the others but if this Jesus Christ is the Messiah of God and is God well then we are going to come up to an Impulse so let's have a look what the\n\n(02:35) Bible says because I don't want to influence you Jesus imposter or Messiah Jesus says in John 6 38 for I came down from heaven well that's not everyone who can say that right that's not something usual I can't say that so either this is presumption or it is truth evidence that demands the verdict to\n\n(03:04) book by Joss McDowell he says some Skeptics have suggested that these prophecies the prophecies about Jesus and the Messianic prophecies were accidentally or coincidentally fulfilled by Jesus according to the signs of probability the chance of any one human being up until recent prison fulfilling a selection of just eight of these\n\n(03:25) prophecies including the one on the crucifixion is one in 10 to the power of 17 and here we are considering only eight prophecies what if we were to consider 48 prophecies the chance would then become virtually zero at one to the power times ten to the power of 157 and you must remember that the number of particles as designed\n\n(03:47) defined by science in the entire universe is only 10 to the power of 80. so this is the number of particles in billions upon billions upon billions add infinitum universes wow about all six I believe they're even more than 61 prophecies and every single one of them is fulfilled by Jesus Christ numbers 24\n\n(04:12) 17 says there shall come a star out of Jacob he would be preceded by a messenger I'm just going to run through a few of them I'm not going to even make a big deal out of this I want to come to a particular prophecy tonight so we'll briefly run through some of these ancient prophecies Isaiah 40 verse 3 the\n\n(04:31) voice of him that cryeth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God so the Bible predicts that he will be preceded the Messiah by a messenger in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand\n\n(04:49) Matthew 3 verses 1 to 3. so he was preaching this very message predicted by the Messiah in John chapter 8 verse 36 it says if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed it's a very important prophecy so according to the statement by Jesus Freedom comes through Christ and through no one else because he says\n\n(05:19) no one comes to the father except by me the Jews answered we are Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how sounds thou that we will be made free he was talking of freedom from bondage freedom from sin my kingdom is not of this world John 18 36 I mean these are astounding claims the miraculous birth behold the Virgin\n\n(05:47) shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel God With Us not just anyone God With Us you'll say but he wasn't called Emmanuel he was called Jesus well you see in ancient times the name referred to something it had a meaning it wasn't just an objective name it had a meaning so Emmanuel means God\n\n(06:15) With Us Joshua which is translated in the Greek as Jesus means the Savior God the savior and Jesus laid claim to being God therefore he's not on a part with anyone in any religious system that's Isaiah chapter 7 verse 14. and the angel said to her you will be with child and give birth to a son and you shall give him the name Jesus which\n\n(06:47) is exactly the same as Emmanuel the savior is here in other words God with us Luke 1 28 31. then the Old Testament says Bethlehem out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel Micah 5 2 and this particular Bethlehem Bethlehem Bethlehem Ephrata which means the Bread Basket the bread of life would come down\n\n(07:23) and be born in Bethlehem and of course we know that that was also fulfilled Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the time of Herod and he was given the name Joshua yave the savior Jesus said the Lord has anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek but this is an Old Testament prophecy as well\n\n(07:46) bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord to comfort all that mourn Isaiah 61 1-2 so there's a prophecy that's fulfilled Luke 4 18. and 19 tell us that that is exactly what Jesus claimed for himself\n\n(08:11) Isaiah proclaims that the Messiah would work through Miracles then the eyes of the blind shall be opened the ears of the death shall be unstopped then shall the land Man live like a heart in the tongue of the dumb shall sing and the New Testament Matthew tells us Luke tells us he went about healing all\n\n(08:30) manner of diseases to appoint unto them that Mornings in Zion the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of Happiness Isaiah 61 3. in the Psalms we read that the Messiah would open his mouth in Parables I will open my mouth in Parables all these things Jesus spoke in parables the Bible predicts a triumphant entry\n\n(08:56) and we have it there in Zechariah thy King cometh unto thee just and having salvation lowly and riding on an S all these things are predictions in the Old Testament my close friend whom I trusted and shared my bread with has lifted up his heel against me that he would be betrayed is fulfilled and we read it in\n\n(09:16) Matthew that Judas Iscariot did precisely there what about this one Zechariah 11. verses 12 and 13. so they weighed for my price 30 pieces of silver even the price that was paid for this deception is listed in the Old Testament and they took 30 pieces of silver and cost them to the Potter in the house of the Lord\n\n(09:43) and that's exactly what they did they brought the Potter's field because they wouldn't take the money which was death money Jesus went to the chief priests and they said to him what will you give me and I will give him unto you and they gave him what 30 pieces of silver and he cast down the pieces of silver in the\n\n(10:01) temple and departed and what did they do they bought the Potter's field every single little detail offered mine back to those who beat me my cheeks to those who pulled up my beard the sufferings that Jesus went through unbelievable I did not hide my face from the mocking and spitting he was tried seven times\n\n(10:26) seven times once by on us and he was struck in the face right there fast and on us the night trial the morning trial the the trials with the Roman officials then he was sent to Herod back to pilate seven times he was tried I did not hide my face from mocking and spitting Isaiah chapter 50 verse 6. they\n\n(10:49) spit in my face they buffeted him smoked in with bombs they said and the Bible says they hit him over the head again and again and again they hate me without cause Psalm 69 that he would be rejected predicted in the Bible they hated me without cause John he was oppressed and was afflicted he opened not his mouth he\n\n(11:10) brought was brought like a lamb to the slaughter everything there in the Old Testament the Old Testament is a testimony to Jesus Christ and when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders he answered nothing just like a lamb to the slaughter Matthew 27 12 and they wagged their heads they shook their heads and\n\n(11:34) say look at this guy where's he come from he was numbered with transgressors they gave him vinegar to drink Psalm 69 21 Matthew 27 34 were crucified with thieves you know that that was the case Mark 15 Zechariah they will look on me the one they have pierced even the way of the crucifixion and he bear the sins of many and made\n\n(11:57) intercession for the transgressors Isaiah 53 12. beautiful prophecies in the Old Testament about Jesus Luke 23 33 34 father forgive them for they know not what they do every single aspect about the Messiah was predicted and his full form in Jesus Christ they divided my garments amongst them and for my clothing they cost lots\n\n(12:28) people say why did he say then my God my God why did thou forsake me because it was predicted in Psalms 22 verse 1. Jesus died the death of total separation for you and for me they pierced my hands and my feet Psalms 22 16. even to down to that detail the predictions are there Psalms 31 5 the last words that he would\n\n(12:57) speak into thy hands I commit my spirit father into thy hand I commit my spirit everything there in the Old Testament he keeps all his bones not one of them is broken Psalms 34 20. that was already a typology with a lamb with a Passover Lamb it was to be eaten but not a bone was to be broken why because the messiah's bones would not be\n\n(13:23) broken it was the preparation and the Jews were afraid that they would come down and run away and they didn't want to chase after them on the Sabbath day because they had hordes and hordes of rules written in their talmud and so they gave the order that they should break the legs that's what the New Testament says but when they gave to\n\n(13:43) Jesus he was already dead so they did not break his legs fulfilling the prophecy John 19 32 33 and they pierced its side so the place of his birth is predicted and the manner of his birth is predicted his portrayal is predicted and the manner of his death is predicted in great detail we've just flown over them\n\n(14:06) we haven't even gone into the detail the nuances the finer details absolutely astounding it's a beautiful statement Christ was treated as we deserve that we might be treated as he deserves he was condemned for our sins in which he had no share that we might be justified by his righteousness in which\n\n(14:31) we had no share he suffered the death which was ours that we might receive the life which was his with his stripes we are healed beautiful statement God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth him should not perish but have everlasting life Isaiah 53 again says\n\n(14:57) his grave would be with a wicked very interesting and that whether rich in his death so he died with the wicked and a rich man gave him the grave and Matthew 27 57 and 60 confirms that very statement so the manner of his death the way he was buried everything there in the Old Testament some of the critics said well hang on a\n\n(15:22) second maybe he wasn't a historic Victor figure after all maybe the New Testament writers just wrote all that stuff down to make it look as if Jesus fulfilled the prophecies now I hope you realize that the scribes and the Pharisees never understood the prophecies because otherwise they would have accepted the Messiah right\n\n(15:42) so here we have a story that all these things were changed and they said that the individuals involved like pilate weren't historic figures well I have news for them because here was a plaque that was found it's on display at a museum in in Israel where the very names Tiberius and Pontius pilatos are there historic\n\n(16:08) figures let's have a look at some of the historians tacitus the Roman historian who lived 8115 speaks about nera's persecution of the Christians of the year ad46 and he says Christos from whom their name is derived was executed at the hands of the procurator Pontius Pilate in the reign of Tiberius so there's an extra biblical source\n\n(16:31) which says when these things happen then you have setonius the Roman historian writing about ad 120 and he says since the Jews were continually making disturbances remember that the Christians were counted as a Jewish sect so they were called Jews disturbances at the instigation of Christos C Claudius\n\n(16:54) expelled them from Rome and the talmud which is the Jewish Traditions said on the eve of the Passover their hand geshu of Nazareth so there are sources outside the scriptures which confirm the very issue Jesus Christ was always Central the Messiah was always Central to the religion of Israel if you look at the\n\n(17:20) sanctuary that had to be built every single item every single practice that occurred within this century is a reference to Christ the most beautiful story of The Plan of Salvation is enacted here in the sacrifice of the Lamb which stood for the land that would take away the sins of the world if you go on into the\n\n(17:46) century there was the labor of washing where you are Washed by the consequences of your action of confessing your sins Jesus Christ the light of the world Jesus Christ the bread of life Jesus Christ the intercessor Jesus Christ the mercy everything is there it's a beautiful story we haven't got time into\n\n(18:10) it even in the topology of the high priest the high priest stood for Jesus Christ he was a type because Paul says we have such a high priest Jesus Christ the one who entered into the Majesty of Heaven Hebrews 8 verse 1 and 2 we have such a high priest who is sit on the right hand of the Throne of majesty in\n\n(18:32) heaven a minister of the sanctuary of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man very interesting stuff for Christ not entered the holy places made with hands which are the figure of the true so that was the figure of the real thing this was just a type now to appear in the presence of God for\n\n(18:54) us he entered into heaven itself Hebrews 9 verse 24. the whole Old Testament was a typology of the very acts of Jesus so now we are faced with a problem the world is going to expect very soon that everybody acknowledges equality of all but the Bible says there's only one way to Salvation and that is through Jesus\n\n(19:23) Christ and that Jesus was not one of many prophets in this world but that he was the predicted Messiah the God man the one who would come down from heaven to pay the price for sin for you and my salvation and we have to know where we stand well there's a fantastic prophecy in Daniel which has put this issue beyond a shadow\n\n(19:52) of Doubt so much so that it is a nightmare for those who want to reject Jesus Christ as the Messiah in Daniel chapter 8 we have also a flow through history like we did in Daniel chapter 2 now when we did the head and the and the arms of silver and the bronze and the iron but here the whole issue is repeated in terms of\n\n(20:22) animals and you have here a particular goat with two horns one larger than the other and the Bible tells us who it is we don't have to guess it's a reference to the medes and the Persians and it tells us that while these horns were there another goat came along with a prominent horn between his eyes\n\n(20:44) and we again we don't have to guess in Daniel chapter 8 it tells us who the horn is on is a king or a kingdom it says the prominent horn between his eyes is the first king of Greece so who was it Alexander the Great we don't have to guess the Bible tells us exactly what these symbols stand for and he says he\n\n(21:05) approached and he attacked the two horned ones and broke off the horns middle Persia was conquered so there he comes flying crashes into the other one breaks off his horns and Daniel 8 says therefore the goat waxed very great and when he was strong the Great Horn was broken so Alexander the Great wood come\n\n(21:27) to his end and in its place four notable ones would come up towards the Winds of heaven and we know that Greece was divided into four regions interesting there were 12 generals fighting over it but after those battles they were just four regions and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding grade\n\n(21:53) towards the South and towards the east and towards the pleasant land and it works great even to the host of heaven and it casts down some of the hosts of The Stars to the ground and stamped upon it yet it magnified himself even to the prince of hosts and by him the daily sacrifice is there written cursively so\n\n(22:15) it wasn't in the original text that's what it means in the King James version when they write it cursively it means it's not in the original so by him the daily was taken away and the place of his Sanctuary was caused down now this whole Century stood for the Messiah and Rome came along and crucified the\n\n(22:38) Messiah then I heard one saint now he's envisioned and his hearing an angel speak till another one speaking in another Saint said unto that certain Saint which spoke how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice added by the way the daily which is the tamid the tamid is the continual there was that fire that was\n\n(23:08) burning when they looked at it the fire meant that the sacrifice was always available the atonement of Christ we can come to that in a later lecture and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden underfoot and he said unto me and now we have a Time prophecy\n\n(23:28) under 2 300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Daniel 8 13 and 14. we have a Time prophecy now we are going to deal with this prophecy tonight this 2 300 day prophecy we'll deal with it in another evening in detail so I don't want to go into this into detail but he is discussing a particular time prophecy and I want to look at a\n\n(24:00) portion of this time prophecy Daniel 8 23 26 and in the latter time of their Kingdom a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand there you have the without hand again thunderous prophecy we're going to deal\n\n(24:22) with it and we're going to see who's going to be in control just before Christ comes and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true therefore shut up the vision for it is for many days for the future he said unto me unto 2 300 days then sell the sanctuary be cleaned so here is a a vision that Daniel is given and he\n\n(24:45) doesn't understand it doesn't understand it at all and he's told don't worry you don't have to understand it it concerns the distant future and it will be unsealed at a later stage but not now we're not going to deal with this in this lecture in another lecture we'll come to it so he's thinking about this Vision he\n\n(25:03) doesn't understand it so here is standing Daniel 8 17 so he came here where I stood and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face so his envision and it sees this heavenly being falls on his face understand the son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision so the vision concerns the future concerns\n\n(25:25) the time of the end and it has so many aspects to it that bother Daniel and then in Daniel chapter 9 from verses 20 onwards we have an explanation of part of the vision so while I was speaking in prayer the man Gabriel the angel Gabriel came to me in Swift flight and he said to me o Daniel I have now come out to give you wisdom\n\n(25:55) and understanding so now he's going to explain something to him and we want to know what it's about and here we go fasten your seat belts 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city how many days in a week seven so 70 weeks would be 70 times 7 will come to that days so 70 weeks are determined upon\n\n(26:25) thy people that's the Jews and upon thy holy city which one is that Jerusalem to finish transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in Everlasting righteousness to seal up the vision and the prophecy and to anoint the most holy Daniel 9 verse 24 thunderous vision\n\n(26:57) thunderous prophecy so 70 weeks are determined cut off for this particular time from this particular time period and all these things must be accomplished innocence reconciliation for iniquity bringing Everlasting righteousness now who did all that who brings in Everlasting righteousness who can make it into sin\n\n(27:26) only Jesus this is a Messianic prophecy now let me tell you the Jews are very upset about this prophecy listen to this this is the rabbinic curse the rabbinic curse and you will find it in talmudic law page 978 section 2 line 28. let me read it to you May the bones of the hands and the bones of the fingers Decay and\n\n(27:56) decompose of him who turns the pages of the Book of Daniel to find out the time of Daniel 9 24 to 27. and may his memory rot from off the face of the Earth forever ah these guys mean business would you agree so now I have to ask you something what did Americans say ask you something are you willing to go on in spite of\n\n(28:28) that curse because if you are going to number with me Daniel 9 24-27 then this curse should theoretically stick to us but let me tell you something I serve someone greater than this curse I have no fear of this curse and I know why they've got this curse because if this curse were not there somebody might number\n\n(28:54) that prophecy and find out whom they really should serve let's see cut off determined separated from 70 weeks cut off from the bigger prophecy for the Jews now let's look at it in Prophecy a day counts for a year a week counts therefore for seven days so a day for the year the day your principle means that it counts for seven years now\n\n(29:32) can I say that just by myself nope that would be arrogant so let's skin some biblical support Ezekiel chapter 4 verse 6 I have pointed thee each day for a year talking about a prophetic sense or Numbers Chapter 14 verse 34 after the number of days in which you search the land even 40 days each day for a year so now the proof of\n\n(30:00) the pudding is always in the eating they Supply apply the day principle and number the 70 weeks and see where we go 70 weeks are appointed on your people 70 weeks well a week has seven days so how many days is that that's 490 days and that is therefore 490 prophetic years which are cut off cut off from what\n\n(30:32) obviously the 2 300 day prophecy which he was talking about so that would bring us to 2 300 years 490 years cut off for the Jews that's what it means all right let's have a look a little further then the sanctuary would be cleansed at the end of that period now I'm going to deal with only this part of the prophecy\n\n(30:58) tonight only this 70 week in order to find out what this is about we have to know when the prophecy starts right so when do these 2 300 years begin from when do we start counting the 70 weeks which the rabbinic code says we're not allowed to study well Daniel 9 24 gives us the answer there's a curse upon this verse\n\n(31:28) interesting that rabbis should curse the part of Daniel does that puzzle you tonight it would certainly puzzle me if I were you because it puzzled me like crazy 70 weeks are determined upon thy people know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and rebuild Jerusalem unto what\n\n(31:56) unto the Messiah so from the going forth of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem remember Daniel is in captivity Jerusalem is destroyed and now is tiled 70 weeks and you start counting when from the time when the decree Goes Forth from the going forth of the decree the Commandment to restore and book\n\n(32:21) Jerusalem and to the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks and the streets shall be built again on the wall even in troubleless times 9 25 wow he just received a Messianic prophecy telling Daniel precisely when the Messiah would come did you know that it's in the Bible did\n\n(32:51) you know that well let's work it out seven weeks 49 days 49 years 62 weeks 434 days 434 years when does that bring us the decree to restore and build Jerusalem and then there would be seven weeks Temple restored and then Messiah the prince so what do we need we need a date over here and we can work it out is that right\n\n(33:30) we need a date either sexist King of Persia issued the decree in the year 457 BC this decree was total political Freedom again for the Jews there was a Cyrus decree previously which pertained only to the temple but this decree are the Sexes 457 BC pertains to the restoration of Jerusalem there we go so we had a starting date\n\n(34:05) so 457 plus 483 that's the 49 plus the four eight uh 434 brings us to the year ad27 but what happened in ad27 69 weeks 43 one day for a year I've appointed you a day for a year remember Die For Real and let's look at the decree as well 7 12 and 13 are the sexist King of Kings unto Esther the priests The Scribe of\n\n(34:35) the law of God of Heaven I make a decree that all they which of the people of Israel which are minded of their own free will to go up to Jerusalem go with thee that was the decree and I at the sexist Kingdom make a decree to all the treasurers that are beyond the river that whatever Ezra the priest shall\n\n(34:52) require of you it be done speedily Ezra 7 21 and by the way a archaeological tablet has been found confirming the date 457 BC so it's beyond the shadow of dot there can be no argument about the date it's found written in stone 457 490 years the total prophecy is 2 300 years know therefore and understand that from the\n\n(35:20) going forth of the Commandment to rebuild unto the Messiah the prince there shall be seven weeks and 62 weeks now 7 plus 62 is how much that's 69 weeks the total prophecy concerns how many weeks 70 so there's another week to go but the prophecy says that Messiah which means anointed one will come after the 69\n\n(35:49) weeks and that worked out to which year do you remember 20 7 a d so the decree went out 4 57 69 times 7 430 83 days and Total Restoration that was only that particular decree unto the Messiah so 27 A.D the Messiah and how old was Jesus but when he started his Messianic Ministry it was 30. now why 27 A.D here's a\n\n(36:26) problem 30 and 27 they don't add up ah but go to any little encyclopedia even a children's encyclopedia and you will see that our time has been shifted and that the whole period is really out by these four years you don't count the zero Year and that Jesus was actually 30 in the year 27 A.D the word Messiah\n\n(36:58) means anointed one and when Jesus was anointed that happened at his baptism now on the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar this is quoting the scriptures when all the peoples were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized and praying to Heaven praying the heaven was open Luke 3 1 and 21. now that year of\n\n(37:28) Tiberius was 27 A.D now how many Messiahs can there be only one that fulfills every single prophecy the 15th year of Tiberius Caesar was 27 A.D and Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit precisely on time now can you imagine now why the rabbinical talmud said cursed be the one who numbers the 70 weeks because Judaism\n\n(38:09) would come to an end if they accept it what Daniel said Judaism would come to an end and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice Came From Heaven which says Thou Art my beloved Son in thee I am well pleased now listen to what it says in Mark chapter 1 verse 15. Jesus was just anointed the year was 27\n\n(38:41) A.D and he says in saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand repent thee and believe the gospel Mark 1 15 which time is fulfilled which time is fulfilled John 1 29 Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world the anointed one the Messiah was he there God anointed Jesus\n\n(39:09) of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power acts 10 38 that took place at his baptism so the going forth of the Messiah would take the sins of the world upon him was predicted precisely in the Bible the date Galatians 4 verse 4 says when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son which fullness of time\n\n(39:36) there was a prophecy that had to be fulfilled and only Jesus fulfills it nobody else and I'm going to put it straight out to you nobody else now Shiva no Brahma no vishna no Buddha no Muhammad no nobody Jesus fulfilled it no one else so there is only one biblical Messiah and no one comes to the father except\n\n(40:04) through him now I was giving a lecture in Germany and I said that somebody got up in the audience and said to me but that's arrogance how can you say that nobody comes to the father except through Jesus Christ that's arrogance what about all the others and I said yeah you're right it sounds arrogant\n\n(40:28) to say Nobody Does it except through this one particular individual but if somebody comes up to me and he says to me and I'm sitting there with my daughter and he says to me are you the father of that child and I say yep I'm the father of that child and he says to me hey out of all the billions of people of this planet you say you're\n\n(40:49) the father that's arrogance well you know folks that might be arrogance but it could also just be a fact right although my sister does say that fatherhood is an opinion and motherhood is a fact so we could perhaps argue the issue but the fact of the matter the point that I'm making is if that Jesus is the messiah\n\n(41:16) and if Jesus is Emmanuel if Jesus is the Joshua the Yahweh the savior then no one else qualifies right or wrong and if he is the creator there's no one else right so can I accept the hodgepodge or must I make a choice what if I'm told to bow down to someone else well I have interesting news in my country\n\n(41:48) in South Africa they're bringing out new laws and new curricula and these are going to be filtered throughout the whole world the whole world is going to get them and in our school system we have something called curriculum 2005. which means that in the future our children must be trained in all religions say all the prayers of all the\n\n(42:14) other religions and acknowledge the deities of all the other religions as well I have a problem with that so soon I don't know maybe they'll be the same age and I'll have to say wow I'm sorry I'm sorry I I can't go along with that when the fullness of time has come God sent forth his son Galatians 4 verse 4.\n\n(42:38) and what happens in the 70th week you know there are people that now there are many prophetic ways that are out there in the world and some take the 70th week and they throw it into the future somewhere way out there and they say that pertains to the Antichrist now hang on a second the 70 weeks pertain to the Jews to end transgression\n\n(43:05) to bring in ever righteous Everlasting righteousness all of it was Messianic all of it was Messianic after three course scores and two weeks shall Messiah be what does it say there [Music] but not for himself what does that mean he will die but not for himself who for us that is currently it gets exciting it\n\n(43:36) gets thunderously exciting and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city now we have a chiasm a beautiful chiasm talking about two forces at work Messiah The Prince and another one who comes and destroys the city who is he I was wrong wrong came and destroyed the city ad70 . so Messiah what should be cut off but\n\n(44:05) not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end of shall be with a flood and the end of the war desolations are determined Daniel 9 verse 26. then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week this is now Messiah the other ruler Messiah that's how the\n\n(44:33) chiasm works so the Messiah will confirm the Covenant with many for one week but now notice in the middle of the week he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering wow how did the Messiah bring an end to the sacrificial system he became the sacrifice he became the sacrifice so now we have the 70th week now folks please think\n\n(45:06) about this the 70th week pertains stalled to the Messiah that cannot be thrown into the future because in the middle of that week by the way the middle of seven is how much and how long was Jesus active after his anointing three and a half years and in the middle of that week he was cut off but not for you and\n\n(45:35) me and he brought an end to the sacrificial system because he became the Lamb of God that take away the sins of the world is that right so only he can fulfill this part of the prophecy therefore can I throw it into the future or does it pertain to the time of Christ it pertains to the time of Christ he\n\n(45:55) shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering there is one prophetic week or seven literal years left in the prophecy what is a half of seven three and a half three and a half years from the fall of 27 A.D leads us to the spring of 31 A.D so we have 27 three and a half and the sacrificial system of the Jews\n\n(46:23) which the temple stood for comes to an end shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself it's phenomenal this ancient prophecy points to Jesus and to no one else much to the disgust of Many religious leaders in the world today 70th week 31 A.D Jesus dies but there's still a three and a half left 70 weeks were determined upon the Jews\n\n(46:55) what happened in 34 A.D now let me tell you something Jesus said to the Jews to these disciples go ye first to the Lost Children of what Israel go ye first to the Lost Children of Israel he didn't reject them even at his death he said go ye first to the children lost children of Israel and they worked amongst the Jews but then in\n\n(47:25) 34 A.D something happens something happened they stoned Stephen they stoned Stephen and the Christians fled and who persecuted them who were sent after them you remember Paul and Paul received the vision and he was made the Apostle to whom the Gentiles aha Peter receives a vision of a sheet coming down filled with unclean\n\n(47:56) things and he sent to Cornelius a gentile and it comes to Cornelius and he says God has shown me in vision that I must not call any man unclean or impure you know he says to him that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with a gentile but God has shown The Envision I can come to you so ad34 Stephen is stoned\n\n(48:24) the commission that the gospel would be carried forth by the Jews comes to an end and the Gentiles take the message further they preach the Risen Christ isn't that interesting and any Jew that wants to be grafted into the Vine to them but he has to acknowledge Jesus Christ as his personal Savior and\n\n(48:50) therefore become a Christian and if you be in Christ then you be Abraham's seed that's how it works Christ was crucified exactly on time according to the prophecy exactly as the prophecy foretold it would happen and in the middle of the week he was crucified but still Mercy lingered until they totally\n\n(49:17) rejected not only Christ but his followers as well according to the prophet Prophet Daniels God Covenant with the Jews would cease 34 ID and henceforth you have to be grafted into the Vine they preached and they were rejected here at the Sheep's Gates this is where they brought him up where they crucified the savior\n\n(49:42) they wanted him as their king of kings and they wanted him to destroy the Romans but he came to destroy sin yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk I took them up in my arms but they did not know that I had healed them Hosea chapter 11 verse 3. I led them with chords of compassion with bands of love and I bent\n\n(50:06) down to them and fed them how can I give you up or Ephraim how can I hand you over o Israel Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I wanted to gather you under my wings like a mother in her chicks but you would not Therefore your house is left to you desolate time when they would be the carriers of the Gospel message would come to an end\n\n(50:34) as he approached Jerusalem he saw the city and he wept be wept if you even you had known on this day what would bring you peace but now it is hidden from your eyes why because of the hardness of their hearts the days will come upon when when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and him you and on\n\n(50:54) every side and they will Dash you to the ground and your children within the walls and they will not leave one stone upon another Luke 19 was it fulfilled yes look your house is Left To You desolate so the gospel is carried to the by the Gentiles by the way what does desolate mean does it mean there's something left or\n\n(51:19) there's no light nothing nothing at all nothing at in the midst of the week Christ the Messiah would cause the sacrifice to cease these verses tell that the Messiah would die by crucifixion on the 14th day of the first Jewish month in the year ad31 and every single detail has been fulfilled by Jesus Christ now notice the\n\n(51:45) Bible says in Mark 15 38 and the veil of the temple was renting Twain From the top to the bottom not from the bottom to the top ah from the top to the bottom who rent it God he tore it now when that Veil tore then the way to the most holy was open which meant any Jew could look into the most holy and live\n\n(52:14) wow why because the sacrificial system had come to an end now think about this Jesus fulfills the sacrificial system yes or no because by one sacrifice he has forever made perfect one sacrifice what if I was to build a little Temple and start sacrificing again what would I be saying if I did that Christ was not sacrificed and did not\n\n(52:43) fulfill everything so if they want to build another Temple let them do it but it is not from God Amen are you with me on this or not so the veil of the temple was rent in Twain from top to bottom behold the curtain of the temple was thrown in two from top to bottom Matthew 27 51. God saw to it that it is written down for us\n\n(53:07) so according to the Prophecies of Daniel God's covenant with the Jews would cease ad 34 at the end of the 70 weeks and you cannot throw the 70th week into the future because the sacrificial system was ended by Jesus himself so it fits back into the past A.D 34 the stoning of Stephen the Jewish leaders\n\n(53:32) reject the gospel and it goes to the Gentiles Galatians chapter 3 verse 29 if you belong to Christ then you are Abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise so in other words everyone who accepts Jesus Christ is Abraham's seed yes or no because Paul says the seed refers to the singular which means that it refers to Jesus\n\n(54:04) Christ and to nothing else neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything what counts is a new creation peace and mercy to all who follow this rule even the Israel of God who's that [Music] the ones who accept Christ that's who it is foreign and I have many Jewish friends and I really pray with all my heart\n\n(54:33) that they will accept the gospel and I hope there are many Jews here tonight I'm not hammering the Jews here tonight I'm discussing a prophecy a prophecy that points to Jesus and he said unto them unto 2 300 days then shall the sanctuary to be cleansed there's more to this prophecy more to it the cleansing of the sanctuary is a\n\n(54:59) Jewish feast and we'll have to look at it it was the day of judgment so it refers to Judgment Day at the end of time end of the world the prophecy will end 2 300 days later and then will come eternity we all know that this Earth was judged once before and destroyed by a flood and everybody who wasn't in the\n\n(55:25) ark drowned and in the same way search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they which testify of me John 5 39. in Jesus we have life in Jesus we have saved in Jesus we can go through to the kingdom in no one else and I want to warn the people of this country and all\n\n(55:53) countries of the world that this showdown is soon to take place serve the Lord and nobody will be lost thank you for coming [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music]",
  "Title: \n 202_where_jesus_walked_total_onslaught_walter_veith_thegreatcontroversy_youtube.txt Key Topics: \n Story of Jesus,Holy sites,Christian walk,Jesus' temptations,Historical verification Guide: \n This source presents a comprehensive journey through the geographical and spiritual locations associated with Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection, primarily focusing on the contrast between physical \"holy sites\" and genuine spiritual experience. The speaker guides listeners through significant places like Bethlehem, Galilee, Jerusalem, and various caves and churches, highlighting how many of these locations have been transformed into highly commercialized and often mythologized pilgrimage destinations. A central theme is the rejection of reliance on physical places for salvation, emphasizing that true connection with Jesus can occur anywhere and that many traditions associated with these sites are rooted in paganism or misinterpretations. The explanation also delves deeply into Jesus' teachings, particularly the Beatitudes, as the blueprint for a transformative Christian walk, and meticulously details the events surrounding Jesus' trials and crucifixion, drawing on archaeological and biblical evidence to support the narrative while challenging common misrepresentations. Finally, the source culminates in a powerful message about the resurrection and the personal relationship with God, asserting that this spiritual connection, rather than adherence to earthly rituals or locations, is the true path to salvation and eternal life. Content: \n (2) 202 Where Jesus Walked Total Onslaught Walter Veith #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg9MsHuQhSY\n \n (00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh this afternoon we're going to talk about the story of Jesus it's actually a very beautiful story and quite a sad story and many were senses as well this is a little map of where Jesus spent most of his life he spent some time down in Egypt as a little boy as a baby and most\n (01:27) of the stories about Jesus revolves around this area here of cities like corazon companion Cana beside us all of these Nazareth that's the area where most of his teaching took place and as we go down over here of course you come to bethlehem down there and jerusalem and this is the great salt sea up there\n (02:00) the Sea of Galilee the story of Jesus is the most amazing story that has ever transpired in the universe and everywhere unfortunately everywhere where you go in the Middle East they will have made a holy site out of all these places and people believe that there is some sanctity in going to these holy sites it's nice to to be there and\n (02:29) it's nice to see them but there is no sanctity in a place you can meet Jesus as effectively in your little room as you can over here so this is apparently the cave where the shepherds were that evening and you can see they have a star there on the floor as they were informed of the birth of Jesus and in this cave\n (02:56) they have put down a church with the reliefs on the side of the Shepherd boys in the in the environment when the angel came to tell them that Jesus had been born in Beslan they must have been out in a field like this so the time of year when this happened could out of being the twenty-fifth of December which happens to be the\n (03:22) birthday of all the pagan main deities like Osiris and zs and all of them because the shepherds were out in the field that means it must have been in a temperate time and not in the middle of winter as the twenty-fifth of December would depict typical scenes of the marketplace this is a butcher if you\n (03:44) would like to purchase your meet there at hang and there's a tremendous buzz around me as you go and purchase your meat so I'm not so sure whether that's a good idea this man over here tried to sell me this chicken and he was adamant that I had to buy this chicken it was on the hoof it was alive and he wouldn't\n (04:08) let me go I sold him I'm not interested in buying his chicken but he wouldn't let me go so he haggled with me and he wouldn't let me ran off to me he insisted i buy that chicken eventually it drove me nuts so I said okay I'll bargain with him for his chicken and so I bargained him down and down and down\n (04:29) and down and down and down with chicken until he got angry with me which was very good and I bargained more not Baltimore and eventually he got angry in these states yes you can have it for nothing and I told him I'm a vegetarian there was the look on his face total incredulity he didn't believe that\n (04:54) something like this was possible but then he lost afterwards and we made good friends this is a tipple typical bakery day and i must say doesn't look too hot does it no you know well anyway bread is bread and baked in the oven it's probably fine and women weren't allowed in here because that's not fit for a\n (05:19) woman a place like that where you bake bread try and tell that to pechanga at the back there I don't think she would agree and nevertheless this is the famous Church of the Nativity where Jesus was born or so they say we never know whether these holy sites are the sites some of them probably are pretty\n (05:43) accurate and that this could represent the place where Jesus was born and these of course these sites were chosen very early on in the history and this particular one by Constantine's mother and she found that this was the site and so they both for this church which was of course at the same time church which\n (06:06) means it was Orthodox and so there's been a tremendous war in this area between the Orthodox and the Catholics who claim these sites for themselves this wall was not resolved until the Ekka manacle movement come came along and so this church now is shared by the orthodox church and the roman catholic\n (06:28) church and they alternate the masses in there now when you come into this place you have to enter a little door that's very loath to bend down and that is to show a sign of respect and humility so you have to crawl through it as it were and as you see the church was totally empty when we were there not a soul\n (06:52) there when I was there the previous time it was packed and the floor is actually a false floor and the real floors underneath and so has the rig mosaic from Constantine's time so it was a very ancient church and of course being a holy place it is filled with mythology's and histories that probably never took place but it was interesting\n (07:16) to me the sunbeam that came in to this church while I was there and they're up against the one pillar you have these holes over here can you see them and what are these holes well the legend goes that Mary appeared in the church one day and then she took her fingers and made them in the shape of a cross\n (07:38) like this and she went up against the pillow and when she and there was a hole there they were those are Mary's fingers that made the whole and if you put your fingers into the holes they say you receive a special blessing as I looked at those holes I saw that the edges were pretty much chipped and what have you I\n (08:02) think it was a very poor draw job that they did over there if it really was divine they would have been burnt in there very neatly so this is a type of story that attracts the people and you will be amazed how in normal times they line up in long twos and put their fingers in there and really believe that\n (08:25) they will receive a special blessing from Mary if they put their fingers into this now the church of course previously had been lower I showed you that the lower floor that was covered by the boards was considerably lower than the present floor so if you want to go down to the original place where they claim\n (08:48) the crib of Jesus stood you have to go down these steps and you enter into the Sepulcher and there it is and this is where apparently the crib stood on that very spot over there so if you put your hand over there you can get this day so an absolution from the Roman Catholic Church that means all your sins are\n (09:11) forgiven by just going poop touching that spot in fact in some of these spots you can have your sins forgiven 90 days in advance so if you're planning the mother of all parties it's good to go and put your hands there you know and for three months you can just hang loose that's pretty neat and no questions asked no\n (09:34) penalties force coming from heaven now we were there at a time when there was no one there which was surprising so when we actually did arrive there which nobody should have been there these people were very very surprised they were busy with their normal rituals and we sort of interrupted this ritual which\n (09:58) did not particularly pleased them but we had a camera there and I took pictures with my camera should have seen the looks I'll show you one just now that we got and this is now an orthodox mess in the basement in the cellar of this church where normally one should not be here they are this is how they were\n (10:23) dressed in black hoods they look more like members of the Ku Klux Klan than they do like months these are Orthodox month saying a particular mass and here is sort of what transpired I'm very angry with that man over there I think if looks could kill i would have been gone he doesn't look too friendly huh so\n (11:13) this is the type of ritual that goes on I don't know what type of mass that was but interesting nevertheless and then when the Orthodox people leave then the Roman Catholics come in and they do their thing here is a group of pilgrims honor in the Roman Catholic setting there is one lady over there she's got three crosses in front of her\n (11:35) face is covered and it's a good place they say to come if you want to be totally cleanse or whatever your problem is outside this church they have your honor massive statue writing over their scriptures they have the skull down there this is also a cult of course the Christian of death and life and cycles\n (11:59) of death and life and going down down into the basement of the church we find this cave apparently this is the cave so they say where Mary actually gave birth but you'll also notice the triple arches which are typical of paganism and so whether this is so was this was a pagan site I cannot tell also in the basement\n (12:25) of the church you will find the skulls of what they say of the skulls of the babies that Herod had killed I don't particularly believe that either but that is what they say and down there that's one of them of them that I photographs down there and one occasion well while I was there a bomb exploded\n (12:48) and the place where I'd just been few seconds previously so quite a dangerous place here's another cave and in this case there's also a Marian shrine and they claim that this is where Mary nursed her infant why the places should be different I don't know the one who is she was born and they even have the cave\n (13:12) where Joseph waited while Mary was given giving birth in the other room so very interesting when you come to this one this is called the milk shrine and when you enter that is called mcgraw toes like grotto dule and inside you go it's another cave church booked into a cave another pagan symbol over there\n (13:38) up against the wall do you have these white splotches and these are certified by Rome with certification from the papacy that that is the milk of Mary that squirted against the walls when she is this a serious stuff when she was nursing Jesus so the guide who was there was very excited about showing us this\n (14:05) and you can receive special unction there is a certificate of approval from the Vatican saying that these are genuine milk splotches of Mary so I said to the guide you know I've been in the other caves as well and there are similar white splotches against the walls these are calcium carbonate deposits from rain he says yes and the\n (14:30) other caves but not this one this is milk versus look this is the famous milk grotto and if you go down they have all these little sub cave and they can see this typical icon in one of them now this is actually paganism this is the ISIS legend you see in the ISIS legend Mary Mary takes the place of Isis and\n (14:56) Isis was also the queen of fertility after all she managed to bear Horace while her husband was dead by reconstructing him and so if people had fertility problems they would particularly pray to Isis and that would solve their fertility problems if they had nursing problems than they would pray to Isis and then the milk would\n (15:20) flow this is ancient paganism resurrected in modern Christianity in these places Jesus of course survived the slaughter of Herod and the family went down to Egypt so the Bible tells us and they spent some time in Egypt and then in time again for the boy to obtain his manhood as it is the custom in Israel\n (15:52) returned from Egypt and they lived in Nazareth that's what the Bible tells us when we go down to Egypt this is the very spot where apparently the Holy Family came and they have these icons down there again the Orthodox Church in these places has these particular so-called holy sites and this is the story of Joseph and his family coming\n (16:18) down to Egypt and one of the most famous churches there is the Coptic Orthodox Patriarch T monastery and Virgin Mary Church in a daria in Egypt there's a very very famous Church and just a few years ago I forget exactly how many years ago but in the late 90s somewhere Mary appeared in the sewer apparitions\n (16:43) of Mary in this place and the Muslim world went totally ballistic of course couldn't have been married because that's not biblical but nevertheless apparitions took place over here in this patio key and here you can see some of the icons in that church some of the symbolism and it just happened to be\n (17:05) Palm Sunday when we were there so the patriarch of the Kia was carrying things made of palm leaves he is also the story in this church the flight of the Holy Family to Egypt of how they moved down from where they were down to Egypt and they have the story of how they came down with the River Nile and stayed in\n (17:32) this particular place and it's fascinating that this church also has the miracle book sort of copying what happened this book this very heavy book came floating down the Nile one day and being a holy sites the people here really are fervent to receive these blessings this is the book that came floating down the Nile and it was open\n (17:58) on a particular page also very interested that is it a closer look at that and there's a little slack of what happened and on which page is was open now it's a middle bound book but it didn't sink it floated you know like the ax so they say and it says the floating Bible on Friday 12 marks from 1976 after the morning\n (18:21) liturgy the people noticed an object floating on the water near the steps where the Holy Family had embarked some members of the church came down and found it was a Bible floating on the water open at Isaiah 19 25 blessed be Egypt my people despite the inundation of the water and the heaviness of the\n (18:40) book it was still afloat and this was considered a miracle by the people a sign of God as a special blessing towards them that's a fascinating text that they quote there as i er 1925 of course it doesn't say only that it's a text that talks about the end times and says the blessed is there will be a\n (19:02) blessing in Egypt and in this area and in Jerusalem meaning that God's people's message will have reached even the heathen nations and many will accept the righteousness of Christ sort of a nice prophecy about endtime fulfillment but they just took up that little piece and pops it in there to make it seem as if\n (19:27) they were the real people which is actually what the Quran also does saying that Ishmael is the true heir and not Jacob this is the place where this Bible came floating down the river now while we are in Egypt I just want to show you one place that I found very fascinating it's a place for the dump city this is\n (19:54) the most horrendous place I've ever seen in my entire life as you come through the streets of Cairo Cairo has about 50 million people living in Cairo and surrounds it is the most chaotic City on the face of the planet there is nothing like it its Armageddon waiting to happen but can you imagine the dump\n (20:18) and the soul and the garbage of that city now in normal cities what do you do with garbage you take it up and you put it on to dumped somewhere outside the city or you incinerate it or you do whatever can you imagine 50 million people living in an environment like that and they take that dump their garbage and they take it to the poor\n (20:43) area and they dumped it in the street and these poor people sit through all the garbage and they live amongst the garbage this is literally a city of rubbish within a city if you take pictures they get very angry so my pictures are not very good they're sort of taken like this you know sort of like that they would they would literally\n (21:10) kill you if they saw you take a picture but what's amazing about the city is that as you come through the dump city there's a portal and this is the portal and when you come through it you're suddenly in a totally different world I'll show you what it looks like amazing this is when you come into the dump city\n (21:29) this is how the people live over there one cannot imagine it my heart really went up to them this is what it looks like whole rooms full of just garbage and they living then this is the asset these are their houses and all of these rooms all of the buildings everything is garbage and you can see the dump trucks\n (21:50) coming in by their hundreds the traffic jams are unbelievable that every street looks like this this is just one street these are all the dump trucks coming in offloading their garbage the stench is unbelievable for for us just to travel through we didn't even touch anything I got trench mouth and the whole rest of\n (22:12) our team had diarrhea after just going through there that's it it is unbelievable the germs in there are killer bugs these people must have an immune system second to none here you can see the traffic jams and the garbage and the fault laying all over the pictures are not very good they're shaky here comes a\n (22:33) donkey bearing a load of rubbish to be dumped in the city it is all pile of rubbish this man is having his tea next to his rubbish dump can you see that where he saw this is rubbish he is sorted probably his only value in life and his little kids living and walking amongst rubbish can you believe that it\n (22:57) eats horrendous that's not a grab this little kid and put her in a in a nice clean safe environment it is shocking the store their lives the rubbish here is the store and as you come through that portal suddenly you in a different world just it's just like it it's beautifully clean and they sense this\n (23:18) little Orthodox Church and Hume rock all around and all of this is hewn out of solid rock it's unbelievable this little Orthodox Church there it is it's the Church of Santa bola and you can see it is absolutely amazing over here there's an amphitheater and one man one man one Orthodox Polish man spent his life here\n (23:47) young man young man went here and he sculpted the entire little city and there's the amphitheater that he dug out probably with some help from the environment and that's him that's the man he did all the work that you will see unbelievable and the entire wall of this rock city are chiseled out with a\n (24:09) story of Jesus in the middle of a Muslim world you come through a city of dump and rubbish &amp; garbage and you're in this beautifully clean place this is little chapel and the story of Jesus written over the walls Jesus with the Shepherd's boys over here at the time of his birth depicted over there the story of his\n (24:35) birth all of this chiseled into solid rock I am The Good Shepherd chiseled out of solid rock the stories of the Bible the walking on the water and the woman at the well for example and these are huge sculptures just to give you an idea this is a sheer face rock rock face with some chiseled material on it any large boulder has\n (25:02) been transformed into a work of art of Jesus this is the story of Lazarus coming out of his tomb that's the story of Jesus coming out of his tomb and one of you can just get there sighs here this is the sheer rock face where he's been working and he chiseled all of this and they have the tremendous story of\n (25:26) Jesus let's get closer while he was blessing them he ascended into heaven and the next one is will see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory one man having transformed the area into an area of hope I was very impressed that's more or less what the world is like you come through this world which is represented\n (25:55) by the city of dumb and as you come through the only hope that you can have to make it to the other side is the story of Jesus I will see the Son of man come with the clouds with great power and glory and there will be no more city of done the story of Jesus is probably the most heart-rending story that has\n (26:21) ever been told and no many forms has been made and even this latest film that has been made cannot even touch on what happened to Jesus and what his life must have been like when they came back to Jerusalem Jerusalem today is a totally different city it's a city of pilgrimages people in their thousands\n (26:42) undergo pilgrimages here you have a group of nuns leading a pilgrimage behind the cross and people are filled with a kind of euphoria they've been to this place that experienced but if a place takes the place of Jesus then we have a problem this is the Wailing Wall and there you have the famous Dome of the rock in the\n (27:07) background this wailing wall is not part of the original temple it's part of the outer court of the temple here up the stairs you can go into this area today you're not allowed in there anymore they stopped us over here so I took this picture just through the crack that's a replica of what the temple looked like\n (27:25) and he has a huge column that was to be part of that temple so that gives us an idea of the size of the original temple this one was never used because it had a crack in it and that is probably a normal size replica of the menorah this is one that they have made in case they restore the temple site these are the\n (27:51) Jews at their wailing wall and you notice all these little letters stuck into the wall over here people come here they write their little letters of whatever their dreams in life either and they stick them in there there's a little short video now when I looked at all of these very Orthodox very sincere Jews standing in\n (28:34) front of that wall showing their reverence towards the wall I wondered to myself if they only knew the rock of their salvation if they could only understand that there is no salvation in a in a brick wall the only salvation is in the one that it represented people today tend to make holy sites out of\n (29:00) places isn't that sad and then they miss the one that it is supposed to represent underneath the wall there's a tunnel and it's called the secret passage and as you go through it you can also come into the back of this place and you can see where the highly Orthodox Jews and rabbis come together now normally these\n (29:25) people will just ignore you the times have changed I was stunned normally if you as a as a pagan come into this place they will detest you they will give you a faulty look what is this unclean fellow doing in such a holy site I was stunned this time when I was there as I went into this place it was just a few\n (29:48) months ago most of these rabbis would come and beg for money something they would never have done even 23 years ago things must be really tough in that place for them to do that but this is their holiest site here where you have these remnants of the ancient wall and just above on the other side stands the\n (30:10) Dome of the rock here is an Orthodox rabbi going through his ritual notice that he has the commandments on his forward the law the torah and he has them on his hand because the Bible said you must bind them on your forest and bind them on your hand do you think it's what God had in mind that you make a\n (30:33) replica and put it over there and then the job's done what do you think God had in mind that you must think accordingly and accordingly doesn't that make more sense I think it makes more sense here's a typical stone from that ancient temple site this was a Herod stone if it had these this recess then you know that it\n (30:53) was the stone from the original temple so when they reused the stones of the temple that built them into all kinds of structures and walls so this must have been an original temple stone of the temple today in another wall this is the grave of David and just like in Catholic sites the Jews will come over here this\n (31:17) is the baptismal site of Jesus and this is actually where the story starts the story tells us that when Jesus was baptized the voice of God was heard saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased and from there the Bible tells us that Jesus was taken into the wilderness to be tempted and Matthew\n (31:39) chapter 4 verse 2 says and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterwards hungry if you are the son of God command that these stones be made bread said the devil now it's an interesting statement if you are the son of God so first he questions God validity God's Word and God's Son as to\n (32:09) his genuineness and then he challenges him to come on the stones to be made brave and Jesus answers it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God of course you need a King James Version to read that you don't have the King James Version you will\n (32:32) have to stop over there because the rest won't be in your Bible but nevertheless that's another story man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now we think that the temptations weren't tremendous temptations but they really were because in these temptations Jesus\n (32:53) make every condition of fallen man every condition the first thing that Adam and Eve had done is they had partaken of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in other words appetite it was good for food was one of their first problem he had Jesus conquered of the fasting forty days and forty nights where Adam and Eve\n (33:19) failed in all the splendor and luxury that they had conquering appetite and conquering doubts if you are the son of God did God really say that so here Jesus conquers the sin of doubts and he conquers the sin of human appetite and passion all in one and the temptation must have been much worse than it was\n (33:49) for Adam and Eve this is today the highest site of the ancient wall and we don't have the temple which must have stood over there somewhere so originally the devil must have taken into this wall somewhere over here where the temple stood and threatened to throw him down let's go to the site over here that's\n (34:11) that spot that gives you an idea of the height and the second temptation is if you are the son of God again the same question cost yourself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning you in their hands they shall bear you up lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone and Jesus\n (34:32) answers again and says it is written again you shall not tempt the Lord your God this is the second great temptation of mankind and it is a sad fact if we listen to the lectures that we did yesterday then this is the sin that most of mankind is succumbing to it's the sin of presumption the sin of presumption\n (34:58) imagine two people trying to solve a crisis on the other side of the road whatever it is a child in trouble or whatever the one runs across the road saying I am the child of God God will protect me poop and he runs across the road another one comes and says God there is a crisis on the other side helped me across this\n (35:23) road and he runs across the road the two to the outside observer are absolutely identical but the one is presumption and the other one is faith and if you are closely all together that's how close they are together and the modern Christianity most of the movements today are practicing presumption power\n (35:46) religion whereas faith is something totally different and Jesus could have thrown himself down because this is what it says in the Bible but it is written you shall not be presumptuous the third one the devil took him up on a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and he said\n (36:08) to him all these things i will give you if you will fall down and worship Me Not people say now surely jesus knew that he was garden that he was going to win in any case why should he do this but this was not only the question that was being oscar here the devil had him alone and satan in all his glory said i will\n (36:28) surrender it all to you again was asked you having to die if you were just one foul down and of course the Sun to be overcome here is the sin of the love of the world and I believe most people will be lost because of this very particular temptation goes Satan for it is written you shall worship the Lord your God and\n (36:56) him only shall you serve love of the world will not get us anywhere so in these three temptations Jesus basically conquers on behalf of man the major temptations which we all have to face in one form or another and then of course he departed to the sea of galilee and on the way there there is a quaint\n (37:22) little town it's called ma alula and this is the only little town left in the whole world where the language that is spoken is Aramaic now this is the language that Jesus spoke and so it's nice to go there it's a nice neat little place and it's also an also docs place largely and Orthodox and Muslim and they\n (37:49) speak Aramaic and the little kids speak only Aramaic they're very very strict in there LMAO so it's nice to hear what it sounds like here is one of these Orthodox priests doing service in that particular place the Sea of Galilee an amazing place this is the supposedly one of the sites there's more than one site\n (38:12) but this is one of the sites where the wedding to Cana apparently took place and you can see the jars over there that's what the original jaws actually looked like and like this those were the rough stone jaws that they first put it in then they kept it in these jars of clay and this over here is the city of\n (38:35) Jesus this is where Jesus actually performed most of his work and did most of his preaching this over here is a very famous site now if you look at it it looks like nothing but actually on top of that there's a huge building books right over it they even see the concrete pillars and the some of the concrete floor what is this this is the\n (38:59) house of Peter this was the house of Peter Peter lived here and that was his home and Jesus must have spent many times in that tub in that house whether it is the house of Peter no one really knows but the Roman Catholic Church claims that this is the house of Peter and if you want to see what's built\n (39:19) above it there it is a huge concrete structure standing on pillars over the house of Peter and it says their lateral petrol Apostolou this is the place where peter state and Peter of course means pebble Little Rock and Rome has built its church on the spitter and there they have a statue of Peter right outside of\n (39:50) it with a fish next to him and this giant statue of Peter enormous that's a fascinating story because Simon was also the name of of course Simon Magus and Simon Magus according to a leaf asleep I was the one who became the picture the PTR the Peter on which of course today we would face this whole system because\n (40:20) this Simon Magus became sorcerer too narrow he was in other words the high priest if you were of the Roman Caesars so whether the pizza that they're honoring over here is their possible is really doubtful it's probably Simon Magus the magician the sorcerer of the occultist that was being honored but the\n (40:43) church built this huge edifice over the house of Peter and at the foot of the statue you can see the symbols of the fish and all of these and it tells us that this is Peter as a possible and a little bit further away there is the synagogue so is this huge building out of concrete with a huge statue of Peter\n (41:06) just a little away across the road is the remnant of the synagogue probably the synagogue where Jesus taught the mouse and there's a little lasted plaque which says the late century AD white synagogue synagogue of Jesus you know life i really was going to build one huge christian edifice wouldn't I built\n (41:26) it there with Jesus spent most of his time rifled it over a little house that's possibly the house of Peter whether it is or not is not unsure it could be because from the Bible description it says when they came out of the synagogue they went across to the house of pizza and that house is right across so it's possible but cool also\n (41:45) would be the one next door knows both possible now this is the synagogue where Jesus actually taught here's another little town for Capernaum was the one ton the other one is corazon and this is what's list of corazon not very much some ruins are left over there these are the cities is that Jesus cursed and Jesus said if the miracles\n (42:10) that had been done in you had been done in Sudan or Sodom and Gomorrah they would have accepted the message but you had ample opportunity Jesus walked through those cities and not one person remain sick in those cities and they accepted him not here's another famous holy place this is the holy place of the\n (42:34) Beatitudes when you go in there you better be properly dressed this is the Church of the Beatitudes a very famous fight and Pope John Paul too has been there of course twice and this is the Conclave and this is the field this is probably the field where Jesus spoke he's very first sermon this is a very\n (42:58) impressive son it's the most intricate most sublime sermon that has ever been preached to mankind and most people today misquote the sermon to such a terrible extent the Beatitudes Matthew 5 3 to 10 Jesus starts off by saying blessed are the poor the word for blessed day is makarios which means a heavenly blessing as a blessing that can\n (43:29) only come from a divine source such an enormous blessing and the words used for poorer there is the Greek tacos which means abject poverty nothing but abject abject poverty not one mic to rub together and he starts off his sermon the Jews sitting there in their thousands waiting for him to announce himself as the Messiah and to say\n (44:00) I am the Messiah you are the chosen people of God I have come to set you free from the Roman yoke you will rise and be the greatest in heaven that's what they're waiting for and here he gets up and the first word as Messiah that he speaks o blessed are the poor and there are various words for poor in\n (44:27) the Greek and he uses the one which describes abject poverty instead of greatness and richness and and wunderland whatever adjective you'd like to apply to them they're to be poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven and he second beatitude it was blessed are they that mourn they wanted to rejoice I didn't want to mourn and\n (44:56) again the morning there there are different levels of mourning in the Greek and the Greek word there is penty o which means abject sorrow the sorrow that you could have for the loss of an only child that type of sorrow blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted blessed are the meek for they\n (45:22) shall inherit the earth this is a Mick pneus that is a humility that you cannot describe in human words practically and blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled and again the word hunger there is a hunger pang that you would feel after you've been roaming\n (45:47) around for days and days in a desert without food or water that type of hunger and that type of thurs what was Jesus doing there what's he trying to destroy their demeanor was he trying to say something else to what they expected he certainly was in fact what Jesus is doing here he is displaying the\n (46:10) Christian walk that's what he's explaining and he's saying blizzard of the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven in other words those who realize their bankruptcy those who realize that they have nothing to offer I come to Jesus with nothing to offer I cannot say to him lord I have one mightier can i\n (46:37) purchase my way to heaven I've got nothing I am absolutely poverty struck I have nothing to offer but a sustained life that's it so I must come to the point where I realized that I'm poor that I have nothing to offer and then the very next step is blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted I\n (47:06) must not only realize that I have nothing to offer as a sim stained individual I must experience sorrow for what for sir I must experience my sorrow for sin and I must look at the son of god and I must feel sorrow and I must have repentance and I must say Lord forgive me I'm sorry for what I have done genuine repentance is the next step\n (47:39) in the Christian walk blessed are the meek once you have realized that you are bankrupt once you have realized that you are responsible for the death of the son of god once you have experienced real sorrow there is no more time to write around on your high horse thinking that you are better than everyone else time\n (48:03) to climb down and to experience humility and to know that others and God are greater than you it's a very difficult road for mankind to travel it's contrary to every human emotion blessed are they which do hunger and first of the righteousness for they shall be full your Christian walk does end with realizing you're a sinner\n (48:31) sorrow for sin and becoming more humble about yourself it has to continue in a process known as sanctification which means Lord change my vile character Paul says I must crucify the old man every single day and I must ask God to change me and I have a perfect pattern which is Jesus Christ and I must say Lord change\n (48:59) me into that image that I may truly reflect me I long to be more like you and less like me because really I am pretty pathetic that's a Christian walk what's the next step once you have done this then you can be merciful for they shall obtain mercy you see we tend to believe we are better than others and\n (49:28) then we become judgmental one of the biggest problems in the church is being judgmental isn't it that did you know some social does this one better than the other and you know that kid over there I mean he's on drugs I mean a while will you expect the parents are you know this that and the other instead\n (49:44) of feeding the hunger and looking at your own self and sayings but look at yourself what a miserable thought you are do you think they are any worse than you are why can you not have mercy and sympathy on them because God had sympathy and mercy towards you isn't that what it's about so Jesus says once\n (50:07) you have come along this road once you have experienced repentance and once you have sorrowed for your sin and once you've climbed down from your high horse and once you ask the Lord to change you that will make you merciful and you will have pity on those that have not had the advantage of this insight blessed be the\n (50:28) merciful and then blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called children of God you see only once you've gone through the whole theory of growth aspect do you come to the peacemakers what is the peacemaker a peacemaker is someone who realizes the\n (50:54) peace of God in his heart great peace have they who love thy law says psalm 119 this is a piece which is a heavenly peace it always amazes me when politicians take that particular by eight Beatitudes applied to themselves and give themselves huge awards without having gone through any of the previous\n (51:16) steps in the Christian experience that's not a peacemaker a peacemaker is someone who has made peace with god that's a peacemaker that's a peacemaker and blessed are they which are persecuted it's not amazing for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of God what's the very last thing that that the Lord\n (51:39) mentions here what's the last beatitude blessed are they which are persecuted in other words if you go through this process if you feel sorrowful soon if you ask for forgiveness if you allow the Lord to change your heart if you are willing to climb down from your high horse if you want the peace of God in\n (52:02) your heart you will be an irritation to the world and they will persecute you it's guaranteed and that's the process of a Christian walk totally the opposite of what mankind in this world once today and the lessons that Jesus taught on the Sea of Galilee are absolutely the most fundamental lessons that mankind needs\n (52:26) we need to take our Bible and we need to be aware if you have a Bible that's marked in red where Jesus speaks you need to be aware I must read the skip we leave them like stories we must read this carefully because this is God speaking directly to us every word is a talent of God every word even the back\n (52:51) from the vest will be in the right places for the ticular reason so we need to pay attention what Jesus thought here's a typical boat out on the Sea of Galilee the little towns around nothing much has changed this is a boat that they found after a tremendous droughts and apparently it's about exactly like the\n (53:12) ones that were used in the time of Jesus so this type of boat was what Jesus would have been in with Peter and his disciples when he taught the great lessons take your Bibles again and read the words of Jesus saying to yourself this is God speaking to me there is power in that word here is the tomb of\n (53:32) Lazarus this is where Lazarus laser very dark tomb of course it's a holy site today but imagine that here Jesus called a man stole instinct lot out of a tomb proving that he is the resurrection and the life and it is just shortly before going to Jerusalem on the final act of his life's work and as he approached\n (54:01) Jerusalem you can imagine what went through his mind this is the city of Jerusalem and the various gate of the ancient city or still there as you come down the hill they have built over here the little chapel of the tears spoke like a teardrop and if you go inside the chapel of the tears it has this little\n (54:24) light on the top and this was picture of the hen with the depiction of the mother hen gathering her chicks because jesus said Jerusalem Jerusalem often I wanted to gather you like a mother hen her chicks but you would not the famous words of Jesus Jerusalem Jerusalem Val that killeth the prophets and stone of\n (54:50) them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and he would not nothing has changed the world is still exactly the same and on the site where the temple stood today there stands the Dome of the rock it's interesting here some of the\n (55:11) architecture this over here is the gate to Damascus now the archaeologists would have us believe that the wall is not today where it stood in ancient time this is very significant because Roman Catholicism has its it has it inside the wall the Golgotha and the Bible says Jesus was crucified we're outside the\n (55:35) walls now that's very significant where was Jesus being crucified in the Catholic gold guitar in another goal guitar outside of the city now here's the prison gate at the top and what happened was here was a pipe burst and the Jews had to dig down to stop the pipe burst and they came across as they dug down this gate which is the Damascus\n (56:00) Gate and you can see it's right down opposite the prison gate so obviously the wall must have been in the same place right so that's very interesting the wall was in the same place as you go into this place this is the Damascus Gate and these must be the actual stones where Jesus walked and with Paul walk so\n (56:21) you walk there you're actually walking on the same spot where Jesus walked here are the holder gates these are fascinating gates the two southern gates known as the holder gates they didn't exist anymore basically until recent times they were built in the Second Temple period that's from the first century I hate this b.c.e before Common\n (56:45) Era to the first century ce e Common Era thank you we'll make that before Christ and uh no Domini the gates provided access to the tunnels which led up to the temple enclosure and the holder gates were used quite often by Jesus they're still closed today there they are probably the walls and the new\n (57:07) construction so Jesus must have walked up these steps as well as an interesting man there was such a nice picture yet his donkey over here this man and I thought that's a nice picture so I took it and walked on biggest mistake you can make this little man jumped on my back shook me like a rag to see if\n (57:28) anything would fall out of my pockets so eventually I rewarded him for his efforts and then my friend came running down and saw him and thought what a great photograph and I stood there and giggled while he took the photograph and did the same as I did and the next thing this man was pounding him on the back\n (57:49) and shaking him like a rag and he asked me why didn't you tell me i said no i wanted to see the show why should i tell you that's what they sell there in the streets of Jerusalem that's a carib bender he's got this big jar on the bag with kelp juice and he leans over and you can take one of these cups and drink\n (58:09) woman and this is the Jewish sector very different an old grindstone over their shops little Jewish children lots of strife in that country this is the old city of David this is where they soared as i er in two can you imagine showing someone alive in 22 and pretty cruel they were this is a the church or the\n (58:37) construction that is booked above what was the upper room so they say and this here is gets M&amp;E now if you go to get Remini you have to choose which one they are to this one over here is the Orthodox Gethsemane that both this huge Orthodox Church over us and right next to it just a little way away there is\n (58:58) the Catholic Gethsemane outside of which are these huge olive trees and they say that these are the descendants of the olive trees that were in the olives on the Mount of Olives where Jesus went to pray remember that Jesus there said my soul is exceedingly sorrowful even today wait here and watch with me Matthew 2638\n (59:27) father if you are willing remove this cup from me yet not my will get yours be done and an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him and being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground Luke 43 44 there's a lot of criticism today\n (59:50) about how for example the movie on The Passion of the Christ which is not a very nice man for me but nevertheless depicts the suffering of Jesus as not being biblical in fact it's probably not enough suffering that they depicted I haven't seen it myself but i have read enough about it and i can tell you that\n (1:00:14) jesus suffered tremendously and the biblical story is very scattered and you have to pick it up piece by piece and you have to look into the history to see what probably happened to him what happened here to jesus in the garden was that he had such anxiety that the blood vessels in his skin bursts now that's a\n (1:00:37) medical condition that occurs sometimes today and it is very very very seldom that someone survived that condition the stress and the trauma is so great when the blood vessels burst from anxiety and that these people die so what must have happened here is exactly the same thing and Jesus could have died right here but\n (1:01:02) an angel appeared from heaven and strengthened him for what lay ahead the Bible tells us of that night that the disciples forsook him and fled mark 1450 everyone for sukin this is the Roman Catholic Gethsemane and there is again the famous rock where they say where he prayed and where the drops of blood fell\n (1:01:30) so here is a holy rock apparently that's where they took Jesus captive and these must be the very steps that they let him up because these go up to Caiaphas temple if you like not his temple his palace and he has a depiction on the side of them how Jesus was led up the steps where they was taken by ropes the bible\n (1:01:57) does not say today this Roman Catholic Church has been built over the site and this is probably a very correct archaeological site and here was the seat of the high priests who that year was Caiaphas now there's some confusion there in the Bible because when they brought Jesus they took him to unearth\n (1:02:20) now I'm as was the father-in-law of Caiaphas and he was the previous high priests and so because the high priesthood sort of ran in the family of course the high priest of the previous year the older one was still on it as a high priest although he wasn't the acting high priest so the Bible is often\n (1:02:42) criticized for its description but its description is spot on and also some of the criticism says that nobody like Caiaphas ever existed well they actually found he's very sarcophagus with the name Caiaphas high priest on it so that is historic as well so if we look at the trials of Jesus the Bible actually\n (1:03:04) mentions seven trials of Jesus which is fascinating because the number seven is the number of God and you will not pick this up by a casual reading of the Gospels you have to read all for the Gospels and you have to piece it together very very carefully because not all of them mention all the trial of\n (1:03:25) Jesus some will concentrate on pilots another gospel will concentrate on the trial of Herod Jesus was first taken to honor first to honor and there he had a trial before Anna and that is where the servant of honor struck Jesus in the face because Caiaphas warned him about what he was doing or questioned him\n (1:03:50) about what he was doing and Jesus said I have done nothing in secret ask these what I have said because i have always preached in the synagogue and that the servant of an struck him in the face that was the first trial of Jesus then they took him with on us to the officiating high priest that year who was Caiaphas so\n (1:04:14) honest and Caiaphas must have had another altercation with Jesus a trial from there they went to the night trial so they had a trial at night and the Bible tells us that Jesus was lowered into a pit prophetically in the Book of Psalms and then they had a morning trial because according to their law it was\n (1:04:39) illegal to have a trial by night you had to have it when the Sun came up so there was a trial of on us there was a trial with Caiaphas and honest there was a night trial was part of the Sanhedrin they gathered the whole Sanhedrin together they had a morning trial and they found Jesus guilty and then they\n (1:04:59) took him two pilots and Pilate tried him but pilot didn't want to decide by himself so he sent him to Herod and Herod had a trial and didn't want to do this either by himself sent him back to Pilate and there was a final trial when he was handed over to the Jews for crucifixion seven trials in all so this\n (1:05:25) is the first place where he was today of course this is a famous site where Peter again is honored and Mary the picture of a goddess and on the way to the Crypt Blessed Sacrament chapel court south of holy stairs sacred pit dungeon taken down this is where the prisoners were kept when there was a night trial and\n (1:05:49) here are holes in the rock so what normally happens is the arms were put through over here so the hands went through there up there and the other one through them and they tied them up there and there you hung with your front to the facing the front now if the Jews found someone guilty they had the right\n (1:06:12) to inflict a punishment but cap for punishment under Roman law they were not allowed to inflict they had to get permission from the Roman so there was a Roman law but they were allowed to inflict punishment if they found someone guilty they were allowed to give 13 lashes on one side 13 lashes on the\n (1:06:34) other in the front so they found Jesus guilty the Bible doesn't report it but it's possible that they gave him the 26 lashes on the front that's possible although the bible does not say so and here is a pit where they would lower a person down and he would be lowered down naked near zombies ante on crosses that\n (1:06:59) are on the wall over here showing that the early Christians recognized this as a sight he would come down this hole in other words you were lowered down and then you were in this dungeon in total darkness and psalm says they have lowered me into the pit so this is what must have happened to Jesus as he waited\n (1:07:18) there throughout the night for the morning trial to be convened today you can go into the pit over there and you can have a look of it then from there after the morning trial it was taken to pilot we was put into this prison while he awaited trial that's what it looks like down there and then he was found\n (1:07:44) innocent by pilot pilot did not want to sentence him to death so he sent him to Herod they mocked him they gave him there his cloak the Bible says that they they tore out his beard they hit him in the face told him to prophesy who was hitting them he was very maltreated in a Val occasion this is little Stratos\n (1:08:10) where pilot eventually sentenced him here store Roman games on the floor over there and this is where pilot said the famous words echo homo behold the man and he was there with a crown of thorns on his head he has been beat in fact pilots the Bible says and his first trial was pilot had him beaten to\n (1:08:36) gain the sympathy of the Jews that's a pretty cowardly thing to do now Roman lashings consisted of 40 lashes minus 1 so they were tied around a pillar and then they were lashed with 40 lashes minus 1 and the lash that they used had a number of strengths and it had pieces of stone or metal on the front in fact\n (1:09:01) many of the people who were sentenced to those lashes died from the lashes just from the lashes because the lashes would call down and rip open the skin and rip open the flesh and records tell us that people that were beaten with those lashes their entrails sometimes hung out just from those lashings so there was a\n (1:09:24) tremendous punishment and then of course another possibility is that he was lashed twice because when he was found guilty in the end and sentenced to crucifixion then you could be then you were lashed before crucifixion the Bible doesn't say whether he was lashed both the times but it's possible possible\n (1:09:43) that it could have happened now they also claim that pilot didn't exist well he is an actual inscription that was found the Pontius Pilate inscription which categorically states that he was the procurator in the time of Tiberius so biblically archaeologically there is no way that the biblical story can be\n (1:10:07) denied so some depict the lashing in this way others depicts that the lashing took place being bent over a horizontal pillar and lashed in that way the Bible also says that when they put the crown of thorns upon him and they gave him a staff in his hand that they took the staff and they hit him over the head\n (1:10:29) with it but the Greek use their depicts that they hit him over the head again and again and again so the sufferings of Jesus were enormous the Bible action depicts that he was wounded and that the wound was one big wound that he was one big wound from the top to the bottom so Jesus suffered like no other man has\n (1:10:58) suffered for anybody or any criminal act ever in the history of mankind and if God hadn't sent an angel to strengthen him he would not even have made it and that is why when he hung on that cross he still forgave those who did it to him and why he died so quickly while the others who hung there longer had to have\n (1:11:23) their legs broken because that was a way to ensure that they stayed on the cross and didn't get off see if they were hung on of honor on a Sabbath on a Friday and they didn't die on that Friday then they broke the leg because otherwise on the Sabbath they could climb down from the cross and that would be a disaster\n (1:11:44) because nobody could catch them because it was the Sabbath so better break their leg terrible stories in those old days and then he was the Bible says led to Golgotha this is the famous street the via de la Rosa where he must have walked and according to the Bible he was led outside the city that means he must have\n (1:12:06) come down this road and gone outside that gate which used to be the Sheep scape and he must have gone up there that would make sense the Sheep skate is where the sacrifices were taken to be burnt outside the city if you are of Catholic minds then you must have come up these stairs to go to the inner\n (1:12:26) Golgotha I'll take it about and I'll show you both of them and the Bible says that he carried his cross but that he collapsed under it and that he had to be helped somebody had to take over for him this is the famous Via della Rosa as you go up we were actually traveling here walking here through a tunnel which is\n (1:12:50) known as hezekiah tunnel where we had bad experience with stoning and here is the famous Catholic Sepulcher or the famous church where they claim goal guitar was now fortunately for Roman Catholicism everything fits into this one church the place where the cross stood plus the place where the gravy's all in one shot\n (1:13:15) very convenient for pilgrims on the one side of the year they have this plaque you have the pomegranate from the grapes upon the Granite's and the grapes exactly like you would have in the temples of bail exactly the same so interesting little pagan anomalies in this place when you come into this Catholic gold the top you have the\n (1:13:38) various earns hanging there with the Holy salts you have the famous stones again here's a man just kissing the slab the slab over here is the one where they apparently laid the body after it came down from the cross and here is the famous Sepulchre where you go in this is where he was buried so they say so this\n (1:14:01) is a holy site if you go in there and you pay the priest and he blesses you you have absolution for a number of months that's inside very tiny little place and the Bible says there was a huge stone rolled in front of the place she's a tiny little place in a church which they say is the Sepulcher that's\n (1:14:24) what it's like just turn run get an idea of the size if you look at the candles there they're pretty small and that's it that's all that you can move around if you go up the stairs in the church then you come to a place where people are very reverent and that is where Golgotha was we have all these statues of jesus\n (1:14:46) and be merry and the women around and very much gold and silver and glitter and there is the spot right over there where the cross stood now there's a also docks Golgotha which is not too far away from there you can in the same church apparently and you can put your money there you could put your money here you\n (1:15:09) can and if you go into that spot and then you have a special blessing that's something you wouldn't want to miss so my friends and I went in there to see what there was and then here is a rock which they say is the skull of Golgotha just there in the church and they say that's the skull so that's the famous\n (1:15:31) Roman Catholic Golgotha which has most of the pilgrims in the world if you come out of the sheets cape which today is the lions gate in the old days it was the sheep's cape you go outside and you remember that the wall is actually probably where it stood in the old days from the archeology then you have a\n (1:15:54) problem if you are in the Catholic or guitar because then you're inside the city the Bible says he was crucified outside the city salvation is for everyone it is not only for the select few within the city and so when you come up you see this huge rock over here it still today as the face of a skull on it\n (1:16:19) over there you see and on top today there's a Muslim burial site it's called the place of the skull in actual fact what it was was a quarry fascinating so this was a quarry where Solomon had the stones Doug that were for the temple fascinating so natural fact this whole valley and it's part of a mountain that\n (1:16:49) continued up from left to right and actually form the mount on which the temple stood and it's interesting that this is the place where Abraham probably simulated in type the death of the son of god through the sacrifice of Isaac but God said you do not have to provide your son I will provide mine and so it's\n (1:17:20) actually the same Hill fascinating so this would this would make sense that Jesus died on top of that hill god is love God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john three sixteen outside very close just at the base of that hill is the\n (1:17:50) garden tomb and then they took the body of Jesus and laundry and linen clothes the spices as a manner of the Jews is to bury nine the place where he was crucified there was a garden and the garden a new Sepulchre where in was never a man yet laid that's what the Bible says so totally unlike the one inside the city here is a garden outside\n (1:18:15) today still a beautiful garden our garden in the Bible xing is a farm this was a vineyard and here still an old wine press so this makes sense there's an old wine press and beautiful little garden today the winepress from the side and there after a dink for excavating for buildings they found the site and lo\n (1:18:40) and behold here were some tombs and in front of the tomb if you can see over there is a little wall and in that wall which acted as a furrow they put a big round stone that could have rolled in front of that tomb and if you look down you will have to look into the tomb and look across and there is a tomb that has\n (1:19:05) been hewn up a little bit so this was not finished yet the Bible says it was not a finished tomb no one had laid there yet and the Bible also says that the disciples bent down to see what was inside so they could have looked in through here past that fellow and I would have seen that too mother there\n (1:19:24) and they would have known that it is empty so this fits the biblical description perfectly also in that garden you have this herb that grows over there from which they make a drug that could need sighs and that's the one that they mixed with wine and Anissa tised anyone who was on the cross but Jesus rejected to\n (1:19:47) drink that this is a Methodist pastor who runs that place there's a typical stone this is the grave of Herod one of the few intact graves of that type today showing was that's probably what it was like so here's the probable sites of the garden tomb there is the little fellow and in front of it would have been this\n (1:20:08) big round stone that would have had to be rolled away that makes far more sense to me than the other goal guitar inside it looks like that of course people believe it's a holy site so they come here to pray and be reverent which is fine but on it says he's not here he's risen and that to me is the crux of the\n (1:20:34) matter he's not here he's risen my god I do not have to go and seek him in some holy place or in some dig he's risen I can talk to him right here I can talk to him wherever I am because he can hear him because he is the resurrection and the life and he that believes in me though he were dead yet shall he live\n (1:20:58) John 11 25 for it is by grace that you have been saved through faith Ephesians 2 verse 8 you know a religion based on form and formality is so empty once you have experienced Jesus Christ is the Mount of Olives the chapel of the Ascension tiny little chapel and that's apparently the place where Jesus went up\n (1:21:24) into heaven and this over here is the famous golden gate it's bricked up and it's closed up and on the other side there's a stairway leading up to the Temple Mount where today there's the Dome of the rock and here lies the graves of the richest of the rich of the Muslim world and they believe that when\n (1:21:46) Jesus returns he will come here and the golden gate will open not Jesus to them to them the Imam Mahdi the Messiah to the Jews the Messiah to the Christians the return of Jesus this gate will open up and because they happen to be lying over there because they had lots of money to purchase that particular grave they will be\n (1:22:07) resurrected first and they will be the first to enter into that place how nice and convenient do you think it will work like that I doubt it because if they had studied the Beatitudes they would have known what it takes to see Jesus we have to feel sorrow for our sins we have to repent we have two more and we have to\n (1:22:32) ask Jesus to change us and we have to come back into harmony with him and his principles and then we don't need that gate we have another gate it's a gate that has pearls on it and it is a heavenly Jerusalem that was built by God I don't know whether there will be much of a resurrection in the first\n (1:22:56) resurrection here I don't want to judge that that is for God to judge but here they are all waiting for an earthly Kingdom I'm not waiting for an earthly Kingdom I'm waiting for a heavenly Jerusalem as exciting as this one might be is this the Dome of the rock is this the place where a temple will stand to\n (1:23:17) go inside of this one there's a stone again that's where Muhammad went up but paganism and truth are very far from each other this is Jerusalem by night and this is the famous burnt house that's all that's left of it in 70 AD the Romans came and they destroyed Jerusalem and it burnt down to the ground and that is a type of the\n (1:23:45) destruction of the world that is coming when God returns we can either become part of burnt house or we can become part of the kingdom of God that is our choice and the only solution to that is he that has the son has life and he that has not the Son of God has not like these things i have written unto you believe on the name of the son\n (1:24:13) of god that you know that you have eternal life 1 John 5 12 13 so that is our choice today we can either be hung up in all the things of this world and we can make holy places more important than God or we can develop a relationship but the price is self will have to give it up and ask God to give us his character a character they can\n (1:24:43) understand get along and love our neighbor as we love ourselves and to let God supreme in our lives because without him we can do nothing amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] me you [Music]",
  "Title: \n 203_an_advocate_for_our_time_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt Key Topics: \n God's Law,Sin and Salvation,Christ's Ministry,The Sanctuary,Judgment and Obedience Guide: \n This text explores the profound relationship between God's law, sin, and salvation through Jesus Christ, emphasizing the unchanging nature of divine law despite humanity's transgressions. It distinguishes between the moral law (Ten Commandments), written by God's finger on stone and placed inside the Ark, and the ceremonial law, written by Moses and placed beside the Ark, which was temporary and foreshadowed Christ. The sermon uses the Tabernacle's intricate design and sacrificial system as a symbolic representation of Christ's ministry, from His crucifixion and resurrection to His ongoing work as our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary, advocating for confessed sins. Ultimately, it underscores that salvation is by grace through faith, not works, but true faith leads to obedience and transformation, preparing believers for a final judgment where confessed sins are pardoned, leading to complete cleansing and eternal life.

(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] all right the next one we we'll discuss over here the next lecture is an advocate for our time and it's a provocative picture that we have over here with the tables of stone and the Finger of God in the background well Exodus 31:18 says and he gave unto Moses when he had made made an\n (01:30) end of communing with him upon Mount Si two tablets of testimony tables of stone written with the Finger of God so God wrote in stone The Ten Commandments he wrote them with his own finger Exodus 32:16 says and the tables were the work of God and the writing was the writing of God Graven upon the table\n (02:01) now in fact there are only three times in the Bible when God wrote and all three times he wrote with his finger that's this one Exodus 32: 16 God wrote the Ten Commandments in stone with his finger Jesus wrote In The Sand with Hiser finger and when Babylon was about to fall the hand wrote with a finger\n (02:32) against the wall so that's fascinating God wrote himself three times and every time it was with his finger and when Moses had smashed these tables because the children of God had apostasis while he was on the mount Deuteronomy 10:2 says and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables God\n (02:56) says make another set of tables which thou breakast and thou shall put them in the ark so the tables of the testimony containing the Ten Commandments written with the Finger of God were placed inside the ark right now let us first Define the question of sin it's very important that we know where we stand on these issues\n (03:24) because there are many teachings in the world out there and we want to stay Bible based 1 John 3:4 whosoever committeth sin transgresses also the law for sin is the transgression of the law is that pretty plain so if you transgress God's law then you are committing sin so if I steal do I transgress God's law yes if I\n (03:57) do anything contrary to God's law by definition of the New Testament then I'm sinning that's the New Testament we look at a dictionary as to what transgression is it's a stepping over to transgress the act of transgressing the breaking or violation of any law so if you're going to transgress there must be a law Romans 4:1 15 says\n (04:25) where no law is there is no transgression that's fasc fting So Adam and Eve did they have a law yes they must have had a law otherwise they couldn't have transgress now can God's law change you think it's written in stone does that say something it's written in stone now man can change laws but God's\n (04:50) law doesn't change you know in South Africa where I come from they had some strange laws in our country some weird laws and they've been changed in the past there was a law which was called the immorality act and if a white man was in the company of a black lady or vice versa then uh that was problematic you\n (05:15) could go to jail today that law is rescinded it is no more and it's no problem so you see you can either remove the law to remove the problem or if the law stands well then if break it you're a transgressor right or wrong okay so where if if there's no law there can be no transgression and Romans 6:23 says\n (05:38) the wages of sin which we've just defined by the Bible is transgression of the law so we could read it the wages of transgressing of God's law is death death so this is an important issue some people say there is no law we cannot keep the law but the Bible clearly teaches that if we transgress God's law\n (05:59) well the way or sin or death now sin separates from god let's read that Isaiah 59:2 your iniquities that's your sins have separated you from your God that's important some like to turn this definition upside down I prefer to keep the definition as the Bible says it sin is the transgression of the law\n (06:30) and if you sin that causes separation so we've been separated from God because of sin but there is a means of resolving the problem and that means is Christ Romans 6:23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord so now two possibilities Adam and Eve sinned\n (06:59) and the wages of sin is death two possibilities either we do away with the law like in South Africa there was a law it was a stupid law so they did away with the law there is no more law and so if there is no more law then there is no more transgression does that make sense yes so if we take away the law that solves the problem\n (07:29) then you're free and everybody who was in jail because of the immorality Act was set free off you go there is no more law so you're no longer in transgression you're free did Christ do that did he set aside the law yes or no no you see the law said you will die so Christ could have said ooh I made a law but that law is too tough for you\n (07:56) fellows so let's just take the law away but God doesn't change so now we have an impass the law says you will surely die but Christ did not deal with the issue lightly had he been had it been possible for him to take away the law would it then be necessary to pay the penalty of the law yes or no no no so in other\n (08:26) words the fact that Christ came and died means he paid the penalty right or wrong does the law then still stand yes or no yes absolutely so some people like to say the cross does away with the law I would like to tell you the cross is the guarantee that the law stands amen because had it been possible to take the\n (08:54) law away then Christ need not have died does that make sense okay I will put enmity remember that text between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and he shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel Genesis 3:15 there would be enmity between the devil and Christ for by Grace you are saved through faith\n (09:18) and that not of yourself it is a gift of God's Not of Works lest any man should boast can I be saved by keeping the law no no I am saved by Grace Christ paid the penalty for me and he died for me and by Grace I am saved if I accept the gift of Salvation I am saved by grace the law cannot save me the law is just writing the law is not a\n (09:49) means to save me the law is just a means of telling me what is right and wrong does that make sense all right for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace What then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace what does Paul say there God forbid in other words what he's saying\n (10:18) here is Grace saves me and works cannot save me but sin must not rule over me transgression of the law must not be part of my life so because Grace saves me What then shall I now be able to sin yes or no God forbid God forbid Grace establishes the law I Look To the Cross and I say wow Lord why did you have to suffer for me and die and\n (10:53) the Lord says because you are a transgressor and the law requires that you die therefore I pray the price for you and that justice has been done justice has been done let me give you an example if you have a little daughter if you have a little daughter some guy comes along rapes her beats her up mutilates her strangles her and leaves\n (11:20) her lying there dead wow and you're crushed absolutely devastated and you go to courts and the judge says now that was not a nice thing to do please say to it that you don't do it again off you go how would you feel cheated you would be pretty mad right because there was no what Justice no justice no justice whatsoever and God is\n (11:52) 100% just but God is also 100% gracious tough to be both so God took upon himself the penalty and he paid the price and he died does he require your death also now there's a trick question for you yes yes he requires your death what kind of death does he require he requires the death of the old man of\n (12:32) sin in other words the old you must die and a new new must rise from the dead in Christ through his power and his resurrection and the new man is transformed he's a transformed man and in Christ we walk this road again we walk this road again and Christ gives us the strength to do what is right wow we\n (13:06) have a second chance we have a second chance now if this murderer is sentenced to death and he completely repents and there he sits and somebody is willing to exchange places for with him and he has a second chance what would he do run out and murder or would he perhaps consider wow I have a chance I better walk straight walk straight so\n (13:34) God forbid that Grace should do away with keeping the law therefore by the Deeds of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight we're not Sav because of any good thing that we do for by the law is the what the knowledge of sin Romans 3:19 and 20 so the law cannot save me only Jesus can save me but the law can tell me what's right and\n (14:02) wrong so if I know what is right and I do it not what was that text we read then it be for me what sin okay so the law tells me what sin is Romans 3:31 do we make void the law through faith what does he say God forbid yay we established the law you know it's amazing how Paul is distorted on this particular point\n (14:34) because people believe that we are under grace and keeping the law that was a Jewish thing no no no no no no the Bible teaches that we are under grace and that works cannot save us we can do what is right as much as we like if we don't accept the free gift of Salvation in Christ it's meaningless because only in\n (14:57) a person there is salvation in Jesus Christ but the Lord teaches me what is right and wrong and when I come into harmony with Christ I will keep his Commandments Jesus says if you love me keep my Commandments wherefore the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and good Romans 7 verse2 so the Bible\n (15:24) clearly teaches that the cross does not take away the law it establishes the law it establishes the authority of the law because had it been possible to take it away Christ need not have died therefore there is now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Romans 8:1 does the\n (15:48) spirit like sin nope the spirit does not like sin so if you are in Christ you say Lord I long to do your work show me what is right and what is wrong and walk therein walk therein sin broke the relationship for Adam and his wife the Lord God made coats of skins and he clothed them Genesis 3: 21 here they had\n (16:17) lost their robe of right righteousness and God in his Mercy says I will cover you again and he gives them the promise of the Messiah and he covers them with his righteousness so the first symbol of death was an animal that died right or wrong yes an animal died and it became a type of Christ who would die for us now\n (16:49) let's have a look at another law which is called the ceremonial law and it pertained to all the festivals and rules and regul ations that Israel had to keep now remember the Ten Commandments were written how we read it by the Finger of God it was written on Stone and where were they to be placed in the AR in the\n (17:14) ark the ceremonial law was written by Moses and placed beside the ark let's read that carefully and it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law who's writing now mes Moses in a book not on tablets of stone until they were finished that Moses commanded the Levites which bear\n (17:41) the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord saying take this what book of the law and put it in the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God that it may be there for a witness against thee now remember that carefully engrave it it's good to engrave God's word one must be there the book of the law and it serves as a what against us a\n (18:12) testimony against us a witness against us so this law tells us something about ourselves right or wrong it tells us you are sinners the law The Ten Commandments tells us what sin is but this law tells us our path in this and it points us to the solution it points us to the solution there are two separate laws so the one was the tablets\n (18:50) of stone was placed in the ark written by the Finger of God the other was written on a scroll the book of the law placed beside the ark now now the moral law in the Bible the Ten Commandments in James is called the Royal law it's called The Law of Liberty not the law of bondage the law of Liberty I'll tell you something if\n (19:14) everybody on this planet kept the Ten Commandments we would be free indeed did you know that because you can walk outside and you can get into your car you don't have to turn the lock you don't have to even turn the ignition just put your foot down and go you wouldn't need a key and you would have to have no fear at night not look left\n (19:32) nor right nor anything nobody will come and clobber you over the head you would be free if everybody kept the law of God right or wrong okay Exodus 31 says it was written with a finger of God on Stone Deuteronomy says it was placed inside the ark 1 John 3:4 to8 Romans 4 existed before sin didn't it say where there is no law\n (20:00) there's no transgression yes and Adam and Eve transgressed so there must have been a law right or wrong yes all right Romans says the purpose is to reveal what sin is by the law is the knowledge of sin Deuteronomy 5:22 and Psalm 197 and Romans 7 and many many others it is complete it is perfect it is Holy it is\n (20:24) just it is good that's what he said about the law of God and Psalms 111:7 to8 says it shall stand forever let's look at the ceremonial law it's called The Law of Commandments contained in ordinances Ephesians 2:15 Hebrews 9 and10 it was written by Moses and it was put in a book of the Lord Deuteronomy 31 we just read that it\n (20:51) was placed beside the ark not in the ark Deuteronomy 31:2 24:26 and it was given after sin after sin Galatians 3:19 the law was added because of transgression so transgression requires a law so another law was added because of transgression so we have two laws the one is the ceremonial the other one is\n (21:17) the moral and the purpose was to reveal the remedy for sin Leviticus 61 6-7 John 7 and 29 and Matthew 27 51 it's temporary it will be done away with now we must know very well what we're dealing with here we must know these two sides of the story because in the Bible they talk about the law and you have to figure out from the context\n (21:47) is it the moral law is it the ceremonial law tricky and you can get very confused if you don't know exactly what this definition is you have to know it exactly so that's what it looked like there was the moral law it was inside and uh above it was a gold sheet which was called The Mercy Seat oh wonderful stuff I'll come to it just now\n (22:13) and then the book of the law written by Moses with all the laws of Ceremonies placed inside it now there are four gospels written in the Bible it's the gospel of Matthew Mark Luke and John people say why is everything think being repeated what's the point well there's lots of point because each one is slightly different Matthew\n (22:36) talks about Christ the King Mark talks about Christ the servant Luke talks about Christ the man and John talks about Christ the Divine so here you have all the aspects of the godhood and let's take a look at the five books of Moses and let's have a look at those Genesis is the book of Origins the fall and the\n (23:02) promise of redemption so Christ is in that Exodus Christ Our sanctuary and we'll be dealing with that wow it's beautiful Leviticus Christ Our sacrifice the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world the lamb stood for who stood for Christ so Leviticus is Christ Our sacrifice numbers is Christ our guide and Deuteronomy is\n (23:33) Christ Our reward so the first five books of the Bible give you the Plan of Salvation in a nutshell tells us about the law and the ceremonial law tells us about the remedy for sin and since the remedy lies in a person all these issues deal with one individual only and that is Jesus Christ gen Genesis\n (23:59) 26:5 fascinating text because that Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my Commandments my statutes and my laws hello there are people that say that the Commandments belong to the Jews and they were given at Sinai on the Ten Commandments on the tablets of stones right or wrong well what laws and\n (24:24) statutes and Commandments did Abraham keep that was before the Jews obviously he kept the Commandments of God so all right the Commandments were there they were there from the beginning but because mankind is so forgetful they were given in stone again to posterity and Jesus said I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his\n (24:50) love Jesus sets the example he kept the Commandments Jesus says think not that I have come to destroy the law is referred ing there to the whole pent which is what the first five books of the Moses but they contain the law of ten commandments so not one Jud or one title will be removed that includes the Ten\n (25:09) Commandments all the prophets everything that was been said by the prophets I've not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass not one chot or one title shall in no wise pass from pass from the LA till all is fulfilled mat Matthew 5:1 17 and 18 so you see Jesus didn't come to\n (25:32) change anything he came to fulfill it he's the Fulfillment of the ceremonial law he is the solution to sin and he came because the law of Ten Commandments had condemned all of us to death and he came to do justice to pay the price so at the cross Justice and mercy kissed each other wow he says it is easier this is Jesus\n (26:05) speaking for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of the pen to drop out of the law Luke 16 and7 16 verse1 17 do you see that the law stands yes or no okay so it stands 1 John 5:3 this is love for God to obey his Commandments and his command ments are not burdensome some people say I cannot keep L God's\n (26:32) law it's impossible it's impossible I've had preachers tell me that preachers tell me it's impossible to keep God's Commandments we don't have to keep God's Commandments in fact the Commandments have been done away with I said preacher give me your wife I need her tonight he said what do you mean I said\n (26:54) well there's no commandment which says Thou shalt not commit adultery no I didn't mean it like that I said well how do you mean it then how do you mean it then is it all right if I knock your daughter's block off is that okay no I didn't mean it I said so so so you shouldn't kill we're going to run through them you know they all want them\n (27:14) but they don't want them isn't that strange either they're there or they're not there the Lord says his Commandments are not bomson and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that what obey him Hebrews 5:9 obedience if you have a gospel without obedience you have a half a gospel it's\n (27:38) standing on one leg it's going to become unstable and it's going to fall now let's have a look at this this should Noto the law in the New Testament Matthew 4:10 or Revelation 1910 Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve check it out for yourselves it's there it's New Testament I'm not quoting Old Testament\n (28:01) here 1 John 521 acts 17:29 little children keep yourselves from Idols that's the second commandment 1 Timothy 61 that the name of God and his Doctrine be not blasphemed if you look at Mark 22728 Hebrews 4:4 the Sabbath was made for man not man for the Sabbath therefore the son of man is Lord also of the\n (28:24) Sabbath yeah honor your father and your mother Matthew 19:19 if Ephesians 61:3 Thou shalt not kill Romans 13:9 James 2:11 Thou shalt not commit adultery Matthew 19:18 Thou shalt not steal Romans 13:9 Ephesians 4:20 Thou shalt not bear false witness Romans 13:9 Thou shalt not covet Romans 7:7 is the law\n (28:43) there yes or no yes in the New Testament yes or no yes does it stand absolutely Galatians 3:19 wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgression till the seed should come to whom the promise Was Made Who was the seed we discussed that just now Jesus and there was a law that was added\n (29:09) because of transgression now think ladies and gentlemen think transgression requires that there be a law right so let's read this a little bit differently let's say there was a law added because of another law that was transgressed is that what it says all right which law was transgressed the Ten Commandments which\n (29:36) law was added because of the transgression cere ceremoni the ceremonial law aha aha so the solution to the problem was added because of the problem that was created by the transgression of the law simple as that so here we had it from the beginning this one over here his name was Cain he said I will not\n (30:00) obey I will bring the works of my own hands they are so many people that say that you know that unbelievable and Abel said the Lord says bring a lamb because the lamb stands for the Messiah who will come who will die in my stead and shed his blood and I trust in the merits of the blood of the Lamb he was saved by\n (30:24) grace or by works Grace so Grace did exist in the Old Testament yes or no so how were you saved in the Old Testament by keeping the law or by Grace by okay so has anything changed no nope I am the Lord I change not says the Lord here is the sanctuary that had to be built according to precise specifications\n (30:50) there was a white wall of white linen all around it there was one opening which was called the gate when you came in there was an altar of burnt offering if you went further there was a labor if you went into the first chamber the first Tabernacle there was an Candlestick on the other side there was\n (31:10) a table of showbread in the middle there was an altar of incense and if you went into the second chamber behind that there were the Ten Commandments in the ark with a covering cherubs that's what it was let's have a look at this Exodus Exodus 258 and let the make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them it\n (31:33) was a symbol of Christ dwelling amongst his people as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle fore says he that thou make all things according to the pattern showed thee on the mount Hebrews 8:5 everything according to the pattern not one chot not one title don't move anything it must be exact God is very\n (32:00) exact so he told him exactly how to build it every single detail and every single detail is important and nobody bothers to read it oh that was Old Testament but the Old Testament and what happened was written for our admonition says Paul so we better make sure we look at it well all these pillars the Lord says this is a copy of\n (32:30) a t Tabernacle a temple in heaven and he says those that overcome I will make a pillar in my house so the pillar stands for the redeemed interesting that there was money to be paid for the construction and everyone had to pay a Redemption price and it was the same for poor and for Rich it was if I remember correctly a quarter of a\n (33:00) shekele of silver and everyone had to pay it and Jesus sent his disciple to fetch the Redemption money out of the fish of the mouth do you remember that and there was enough to pay for two of them Jesus is even willing to pay the Redemption money for you but that was the symbol the socket everybody has to\n (33:27) partake has to pay has to give up something and here was an outer gate one gate and this gate had a covering over here which had four colors in it there was purple in it there was red in it there was blue in it and there was white in it and then there was fine gold thread purple is the color of royalty\n (33:54) red is the color of sacrifice blue is the color of obedience and white is the color of righteousness those are the aspects of Christ and by the way if you want to have purple you have to mix red and blue so sacrifice and obedience makes for royalty wow it is beautiful Jesus says I am the door and no he comes to the the father\n (34:28) except by me and if you don't enter through this door he says you have no part of him so Jesus is the door this gate there was only one and then there is another one over there this one was called the gate that one was called the door and it had the same material and then there was another one on the inside which had the same\n (34:51) material the same colors so Christ is identified with the gate and with the door and the veil between the first and the second Chambers and when you came in over here the first thing you were confronted with was the altar of burnt offering what happened there sa a sacrifice and who does that sacrifice\n (35:17) represent represents Christ so the white linen around it is this is the righteousness of Christ when you enter in through the gate in other words you accept salvation in Jesus Christ you enter in through the gates and you are surrounded by the righteousness of Christ beautiful it's called justification and you stand before the\n (35:40) altar of burnt offering and there is a lamb and you witness the sacrifice of the Son of God in type to take away your sins Hebrews 9:24 says for Christ is not entered into holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us so the Earthly\n (36:06) Sanctuary served just as a copy of a Heavenly Sanctuary where Christ is our high priest Hebrews 9:8 says the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly could only begin once the Earthly was completed how do we know\n (36:28) that because in the Earthly Tabernacle the priest was not allowed to enter the first chamber until the sacrifice had been made there was a lamb and then there was a ram of consecration the lamb represents Christ at the beginning of his ministry the ram represents Christ at the end of his ministry and if that\n (36:51) Ram of consecration was sacrificed the priest was permitted to go into the holy place and the Bible tells us that Christ entered not with the with the blood of sheep and goats but with his own precious blood so this served as a guarantee of the coming Messiah beautiful symbolism who serve as an example and a shadow of the Heavenly\n (37:17) things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle it's a copy of the Heavenly he Hebrews 8: 5 so the the Tabernacle pitched in the midst of the people represented the ministry of Jesus Christ now don't you think it's important that we understand the ministry of Christ yes or no I think\n (37:38) so Jesus in the midst of his people John 1:14 so let's study the ministry because if we study it then we will be able to discern many a deception in the world out there many people end their gospel once they've come through the gate oops there they are they're inside I'm covered by the righteousness of Christ\n (38:02) life goes on as before nothing has changed now no no there's more to the ministry you first face that first Tabernacle let's look at the furniture once again you come in then there was the altar of burnt offering then there was the labor and then you went into the first chamber over there and in the\n (38:24) first chamber on the one side there was the Candlestick then there was the altar of incense over there then there was the table of showbread and there was the Candlestick the seven Candlestick and on the inside there was this Ark of the Covenant so the court the outer Court represents the Earth the gate the door\n (38:50) the veil represent the three dimensions of Christ's Ministry three dimensions not just one there are four pillars for the veil four coverings four colors four ingredients in the showbread four is the number of the earth NorthEast Southwest the whole earth is covered by this Redemption 48 boards 60 pillars\n (39:12) multitudes of 144,000 the sockets were made of silver as I said made from the Redemption money for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid with is Christ Jesus 1 Corinthians 3:11 he is the foundation of every single pillar five bars holding the structure together five factors holding the body in unity\n (39:32) of the spirit remember there is one body one Spirit one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all five factors holding the sanctuary together now let's get to the sacrifice the lamb was brought and The Sinner was faced with the lamb what did he have to do he had to place his hands on top of the\n (39:56) lamb and and then the lamb was killed and the fat was removed and burnt fat is a symbol of sin the burning of fat is the purging of sin Leviticus 3:3 Psalms 37:20 so that fat which sits around the inner parts surrounding the very internal organs becomes a symbol of sin which is burnt up in Christ beautiful\n (40:21) symbolism the lamb was attached to the horns of the altar the lamb Christ is bound to the sacrifice he becomes your sacrifice so the lamb attached by Accord to the horns of the Altar and you had to sacrifice the land you had to see that your part in it was you put the lamb to death the high priest catches the blood\n (40:49) the high priest catches the blood and in a sense the blood of the Lamb purges you of yourself and the high priest himself is a symbol of Christ of course in this system the lamb and the high priest are really one but of course the lamb is dead after the process so the high priest represents Christ who is in a\n (41:13) sense the Risen Savior Leviticus 42731 and if anyone sin through ignorance while he doeth something against any of The Commandments of the Lord then he shall bring his offering and he shall lay his hands upon the the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering we are responsible for the death of Christ\n (41:33) and the priest shall make atonement of him Christ makes atonement for us the priest becomes a type and it shall be forgiven him there's the plan how to get rid of sin so you laid your hands on top of this slam let's read what the Jewish encyclopedia says about this it says the laying of hands of upon the victim's\n (41:57) head is an ordinary right by which the substitution and transfer of sins are affected in every sacrifice there is the idea of substitution the victim takes the place of the human sinner I have a question for you was the Gospel preached to them yes or no yes it was not preached to them like it's preached to\n (42:18) us but it was preached to them in type if they had studied the ceremony they would have seen the ministry of Christ but they started using the ceremony as a ritual and when you ritualize something you lose the essence so the high priest the lamb the blood everything points to Jesus Christ who is the Lamb of God that taketh away\n (42:50) the sins of the world John 1 verse 29 Behold Him look at him there's the typology it's fascinating that Abraham was to sacrifice Isaac and he was to do it on Mount Moriah Mount Mariah is the very Mount where the temple is built was built and the temple stood for the sanctuary the ministry of Christ when they quarried\n (43:17) Mount Mariah Solomon had the Quarry made in Mount Mariah and they dug out the blocks of stone and that created a valley between two two hills and the one Hill was called golata fascinating that mount Mariah was one Hill and that Jesus Christ died on Mount Mariah wow he died on the same month symbolizing the death of the Lamb my\n (43:49) little children these things I write unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous so is Christ dead now that he died or is he resurrected and is an advocate for us advate so is Christ's work finished at the cross or is he doing still something he's still doing something oh\n (44:11) yes the price for sin has been paid in the fall but the work of Christ is not finished otherwise it should have come to an end then Christ is the ad at we can still find Salvation in him he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with him his stripes we\n (44:39) are healed if we confess our sins he faithful and just to forgive us our sins so must we confess yes or no absolutely and to cleanse us from all unrighteous do you know that there are preachers who say that there is nothing more wicked than we can do than to talk about the sinful nature of man I have news for you\n (44:59) if we don't talk about Sin then we don't need a solution you might as well go without Christ right or wrong okay so all of these symbols stood for the high priest now here's the labor the labor came after the sacrifice Many religious systems come in they want to accept the righteousness of Christ they come into the door they accept the\n (45:25) vicarious sacrifice of the cross and then they say thanks a lot now I'm saved but there's a washing to be done yes or no yes a cleansing of rebirth a change must take place in the character something must happen so the labor represents the washing by water there it was and you washed at the labor the\n (45:49) priest did it as a symbol for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the Candlestick and then there was the first chamber and the table and the sobre which was called the sanctuary and the high priest went into that daily not without blood now this is what happened imagine this The Sinner brings the lamb the lamb is\n (46:12) slaughtered and the entrails are burnt and the carcass is eventually burnt without the city outside the city and that symbolizes that Christ would die outside that he would be killed and eliminated it there outside the city then the high priest would cook a portion a tiny ceremonial portion and the writings tell us that it was about\n (46:38) the size of a pee he would eat it and in type that confessed sins to the lamb were transferred to the high priest now he in type carries your sin like Christ Bears our sins now the high priest did a sacrifice for himself plus all the confessed sins that he had taken upon himself and he took that blood and\n (47:01) he brought it into the sanctuary daily and he put it on the horns of the altar so in type our sins have been removed and placed on record in the sanctuary and he keeps the light burning the light stands for Jesus Christ the light of the world this is a depiction of the uh Ark of Titus where he took the Furnishings\n (47:24) away after the destruction of Jerusalem and They Carried these things away where they are today one wonders Jesus says John 8:12 I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life oil that was in the lamp is a symbol of the holy spirit that would disseminate the life so\n (47:50) through the Holy Spirit and the smoke of the incense the incense that was burnt on the altar of incense which came from the the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands everything dealt with Jesus so the priest burnt this incense and this represents our prayers going up to God\n (48:10) being made acceptable through Jesus Christ and then there was this blood that was transferred transferring the record of sin to the sanctuary I am the living bread which comes down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is in my flesh which I shall give for the light of the\n (48:32) world that was the table of sh bread without leaving no sin now in other words you came in you were covered by the righteousness of Christ you accept the sacrifice of sacrifice of Christ you must be washed by rebirth and then what must you do partake of the light through the Holy Spirit Jesus is the light of the world my word Thy word\n (49:00) is a what unto my feet a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path and if you do not partake of the body of Christ if you do not make Christ part of you you have no part in him and you speak to God through Christ so Christ becomes your personal friend you eat sleep and drink and walk him that's called\n (49:28) sanctification and the Bible says without sanctification you will not SE God it's not enough to say I'm Justified but I don't want any of the rest of it you got to take the whole package or nothing that's what it's all about so the table of showbread represents Christ for his people there are 12 show breads\n (49:50) 12 tribes of Israel 12 Apostles the numbers are significant the ingredients of the incense represents all mankind Hebrews 9:3 and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all now there we go to the most holy now we've been talking a lot and maybe you're smoking a little bit up\n (50:15) here already so shake your heads and go wake up you all awake great cuz now we're going to do something really exciting we're going to look at that second Tabernacle they say my hair is all untidy who cares anyway the first Tabernacle represents Your Daily Commitment to Christ partaking of the word partaking of the life leaving\n (50:43) living a life in Christ but it also contains the record of all confessed sins is that understood by everyone because the blood was transferred to the horns of the the altar is that right so it contains the records of all the sins let me tell you some good news blessed are you if the record of your sin is transferred and recorded in\n (51:12) the sanctuary blessed are you it's not bad news it's good news because those sins that are recorded there are forgiven sins did you know that all the sins that you have confessed over the lamb and that have been transferred to the high priest and have been recorded in the heavens are your confessed sins so one\n (51:38) day when the record of Heaven is to be purged and cleansed from sin they will open the books and they will say here is the record of Walter fight's sin and they will read a list so long it was stretch 50,000 times around the globe hopefully and the devil will come and he will be the accuser of the Brethren\n (52:08) right or wrong and he will say I know that I made that guy do this and they look up the record and they say yep here it is it says pardon anything else but I know that he did that let's check it out oh yep here it is it says pardon and if he can mention one that's not on the list you're in trouble so get your sins into the\n (52:39) sanctuary confess and forsake and you will be safe the judgment is good news if your sins are recorded in the sanctuary now in heaven one day I have good news for you Christ's Redemption is so complete that you will stand before God not as forgiven Sinners but as individuals that are as though they have never\n (53:18) sinned how far will God remove your sins from you as far as the East is from the West that's infinitely far there's no way they'll ever get back to you you will stand before God as though you have never sinned you will have a perfect right to Heaven one day if your record of sin is recorded over there it's the most\n (53:43) beautiful Doctrine in the world the most beautiful Doctrine in the world there's nothing to fear if you have confessed your sins and forsaken them remember Mary Magdalene do you remember her when when she was accused Jesus said to her I don't condemn you either is that right that's Grace that's called Grace\n (54:06) and then he says go and sin no more what's that putting her under law so law and Grace go together so now the record of sin is there and now once a year the record of sin was cleansed and for that purpose the priest had to go into to the most holy what an ominous situation he had little bells around him\n (54:32) pomegranat and bells pomegranat and bells pomegranates and bells and the bells would ring and they used to tie a string to his leg because if he went into the presence of a holy God with sin he would die instantly and they would pull him out from under the the veil dead that's how serious it was so it was a serious situation the priest\n (54:57) would make full confession of his sins and make sure his sins were all purged and then he went into the presence of a holy God he entered into the most holy now there was the Ten Commandments the tablets of stone and the two angels and the shikina glory would appear above the Ten Commandments which contain the law\n (55:20) of God condemning The Sinner to death if he's a transgressor was The Mercy Seat and The Mercy Seat was of pure gold and it represents the mercy of Christ shielding you from the condemnation of the law fascinating story you know that Mercy sheet was 1 and a half cubits High and the great on which the sacrifice was\n (55:46) burnt outside on the altar was one and a half cubits High little detail like that just boggles the mind in other words God's justice is as high as his Mercy wow anyway here he would go in and he would sprinkle special blood at the veil and in front of the Ark it contained of course the Ten Commandments great peace\n (56:17) have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them Psalms 11965 look at the furnisher Furnishings there was the altar of burnt offerings the labor and then on either side the table of showbread and the candlesticks then the altar of incense and then the ark it was in the shape of a cross the\n (56:39) cross and its shadow beautiful now when these things were thus ordained the priest went always into the first Tabernacle accomplishing the service of God that represented sanctification through your life Hebrews 9: 6 we have a high priest who passed into the heavens Jesus Son Christ the son of God Hebrews\n (57:00) 4:14 we have that privilege today we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of majesty a minister of the sanctuary and of the true sa Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man hello is there a tabernacle which God pitched yes or no yes well either the scriptures are there to admonish us and\n (57:23) to give us the truth or they are not it says there is one so I believe there is one cuz that's what it says but Christ being come a high priest by his own blood he entered once into the holy Place having ordained Eternal Redemption for us Hebrews 9 11:12 Christ is that high priest the veil of the temple was rent in Twain\n (57:45) from top to bottom the Earthly sacrifice came to an end the ceremonial law was done away with why because it was fulfilled in Christ if I now take a lamb and I sacrifice it today for my sins what am I saying I've said this before that Jesus's sacrifice was not good enough now the Jews want to build a\n (58:09) new Temple and Institute the sacrificial system yes or no I want to tell you that's blasphemy yes and their sins and iniquities will remember no more now where remission of these is there is no no more offering for sin having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New\n (58:32) and Living Way we have a new covenant with Christ it's the same as the old but it's been fulfilled in Christ and I now look to Jesus I don't have to look at lambs and goats I look at Jesus so the temple really has been done away with and should remain done away with time for a new Temple they say so I don't think so\n (59:00) for Christ has not entered into the ho is made with hands which are a figure of the true but into heaven itself why build an Earthly one if there's a Heavenly one yes or no doesn't make much sense all right so let's have a look at this interesting service so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of\n (59:17) many and he shall appear a second time without sin unto salvation wherefore he's able to save to the uttermost those that come unto him everything the high priest wore all the clothing stood for Christ the inner garment the white one the righteousness of Christ the outer one then the ephod all these symbols the\n (59:39) colors tying him to the door and the gate and the veil every single Stone the 12 Stones The 12 Tribes of Israel everything refers to the Tabernacle even the roof of the Tabernacle out side was an outer covering which was made of badger skins representing Christ's humanity and then you have the colors\n (1:00:03) that are associated with the door so the badger skin Christ veiled his divinity with Humanity Christ the Savior skins of rams died red Christ the sacrifice covering of woven goats hair the righteousness of Christ and the inner Royal covering blue Scarlet purple Christ the worthy King Christ the exalted savior isn't it\n (1:00:27) fascinating wow now there were seven annual Jewish feasts also associated with the service this was all written in the law of Moses there was a type and there was an antitype there was the Passover which was the sacrifice of the Lamb it represented the crucifixion notice that it was on Nissan 14 then there was the Feast of unle\n (1:00:51) bread the very next day Nissan 15 that's Christ the body of Christ Christ in the grave and then you had the Feast of first fruits which is Nan 16 so 14 15 16 the three days the Friday the Saturday Sunday of the crucifixion it's the resurrection so even in their annual feasts they were celebrating the work of\n (1:01:14) Christ does that stound you wow and then you had the Feast of Weeks which was Sian 6 there was 50 days thereafter now was Pentecost it celebrated the giving of the law the tools of righteousness how to be right in terms of your obedience Grace comes from God so now they were fully equipped at the same time they were sent out to\n (1:01:42) preach Christ the solution to the sin problem the law defines the sin problem Christ is the solution to the sin problem so the cost of redemption so five Trumpets the Feast of trumpets tishy was the heralding of judgment an advent movement the day of atonement the pre-advent Judgment tishy 10 and then\n (1:02:09) the Feast of Tabernacles going home now let's have a look at one of these the day of atonement the Harvest of redemption would come thereafter so the annual cleansing of the Earthly Sanctuary this is great stuff the day of judgment that's what it stood for so they blew the trumpets and they brought two goats and\n (1:02:31) the one was called the Lord's goat and the other one was Azazel it was the scapegoat but Azazel means the evil one Lucifer so they cast lots and the scapegoat was led into the desert and was not sacrificed he did not die he was just LED away but the Lord's goat was sacrificed so the blowing of the trumpet\n (1:03:05) is a symbol of judgment Revelation 1467 Joel 21 and the Lord's goat was sacrificed and the priest entered with this blood into the most holy remember the bells and the rope tied to his feet and Hebrew says into the second chamber that's the most holy went the high priest alone once every year not without\n (1:03:29) blood Leviticus 16:19 he shall sprinkle the blood seven times and cleanse it so this cleanse the sanctuary and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel remember all the recorded sins were there and all of these had to now been cleansed from the sanctuary and he shall make atonement for the holy place that's the first\n (1:03:57) Tabernacle because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel and because of their transgressions and all their sins and so shall he do for the Tabernacle of the congregation that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness so the whole thing was to be cleansed from the record of sin unbelievable so\n (1:04:16) the high priest took in this ceremony all the sins that had been confessed for that entire year upon himself self and he came out and he placed his hands on the scapegoat and he pushed his hands on it and transferred the record of sin who made you sin who made you sin Satan made you sin so if Satan made\n (1:04:44) you sin This Record is transferred onto the scapat Azazel which stands for Lucifer and he will one day pay the price for the forgiven sins if you have not confessed your sins who pays for those you do wow now he doesn't become the sin Bearer because the Bible says without the shedding of blood there is\n (1:05:09) no forgiveness of sins he's led into the desert for on that day shall the priest make atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord Leviticus 16:30 so in the day of judgment you will stand before God with how many sins on you n none isn't that astounding that is phenomenal Jesus is\n (1:05:41) cleansing is total you stand before God as though you have never sinned Redemption is complete come now let us reason together says the Lord though your sins be like Scarlet they shall be as white as as snow that are red as Crimson they shall be like wool if we confess our sins it's very important he is faithful and just to\n (1:06:05) forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from how much unrighteousness all of it 1 John 1:9 there are preachers who preach the opposite of this who say there is no greater damage that can be done than to preach of the L sinful condition of man we have to acknowledge and confess our sins if we want to be part of Salvation\n (1:06:33) so it was a time of final confession a time of cleansing a time of judgment and those who did not partake were cut off from the people that's the sanctuary message cleansing of the sanctuary and he said unto me unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Daniel 8:14 there will come a time when Christ will\n (1:06:58) enter the second chamber and will start cleansing the sanctuary and we'll deal with this 2,300 year prophecy at another stage unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed so this judgment will take place the Bible says I beheld till Thrones were cast down the Ancient of Days did sit the Judgment was set and\n (1:07:24) the books were opened and behold one like the son of man came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world acts 17:31 we better take note of judgment it's coming 2 Corinthians 510 for we must who all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that\n (1:07:49) everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he has done whether it be good or bad so where would you like your sins to be on your head or recorded in the sanctuary hey get them recorded the Lord will judge his people there's the list and if that list is as long as you can imagine then goody for\n (1:08:18) you but if that list is one too short you could be in trouble so examine yourselves whether you be in the Lord and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be Revelation 22:12 the coming of the Lord will reveal these things I believe that we have nothing to fear that 2,300 days has a\n (1:08:46) specific time it starts 457 if you add 2,300 comes to 1844 it's an interesting time it's a a very interesting time it's the time when the Communist Manifesto was written it was a time when the evolution Theory went out into the world precisely 1844 it was a time when there was a big clash between the Messiah and\n (1:09:10) the non- Messiah the music of the world was written about the creation wonderful time fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come what is the standard of judgment going to be let's ask the Bible so speak and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of Liberty the law is\n (1:09:34) going to be the standard of judgment James 2:12 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter ecclesiast 12 13 and 14 fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil do we hear\n (1:09:55) much preaching about this in the world today no oh no oh no if you love me says Jesus keep my Commandments John 14:15 beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his\n (1:10:19) sight John 32122 ask forgiveness God will place you you under grace and your record of sin will be recorded in the sanctuary go and sin no more eat the bread of life drink in the Water The Living Water take the light of the world live eat and drink your religion there's no good having a halfway religion and then when Christ\n (1:10:47) returns you will be cleansed of all your unrighteousness all of it none of it will be upon your head not one stain and the righteousness of Christ will cover you again if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 John 1:9 repent therefore and be converted that your\n (1:11:14) sins may be blotted out this is a gospel we never hear anymore but this is the truth ladies and gentlemen this is the truth believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and they shall be saved but believing faith without works without doing is useless he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let\n (1:11:43) him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is Holy let him be holy still Revelation 2211 very shortly that decree will go out and probation will end and if you on the filthy side it's too late you remain filthy if you're on the righteous side you remain righteous and very soon the Lord will\n (1:12:07) come the Lord is longsuffering towards us not willing that any should perish that all should come to repentance 2 Peter 3:9 I sometimes wonder when I look at the world Lord why haven't you come yet some people say the Lord will have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah if he doesn't come quickly because things are\n (1:12:30) bad but I know the character of my God and he is longsuffering and here is the patience of the Saints they that keep the Commandments and the faith in Jesus Jesus is coming soon folks amen he's coming soon with the clouds of heaven and it's my prayer that every single one of us will have a right understanding\n (1:12:53) what it means to serve him it doesn't just mean to serve him and sing Hallelujah it means accepting him as my personal Savior and my king and a king is one who is to be obey it not because he wants to Lord it over me no the Lord Jesus demonstrated that he came to wash feet didn't he yes he didn't come to Lord it over us but\n (1:13:22) because it is good for us because it is right for us he says I will write my laws into their hearts that'll be the New Covenant and when the law is in the heart you will want to do what is right you will want to do what is right I'll tell you your relationships will improve your love for each other will improve\n (1:13:42) your whole mindset will improve if we come back into obedience and an obedience relationship with God and there's nothing to fear of the Judgment if you have confessed your sin nothing and the longer the list of sins as I have said that is recorded in in the heavens the better because it means they're all there and forsake them and\n (1:14:06) give them up that's my prayer for you tomorrow we start looking at the other side of the coin I have now done what I possibly can to show you what the biblical criteria for salvation and a relationship with Christ what they entail tomorrow we will look at the counterfeit we will identify the Antichrist by name and I know that some\n (1:14:32) might get hurt but if you are angry with me be angry with me but not with a word you can throw a tomato at me but come back and eat more of the word and let's see if we can get through this together thank you for coming [Music] a [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

  "# Title:204_the_mists_of_time_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nBiblical Prophecy Interpretation,Daniel's Vision Explored,Kingdoms Rise and Fall,Divine Intervention,End-Time Deception\n\n## Guide:\nWalter Veithâ€™s lecture, \"The Mists of Time: Total Onslaught,\" intricately explores the prophetic books of Daniel and Revelation, asserting their interconnectedness and essential role in understanding God's divine plan for history. He emphasizes the importance of interpreting biblical symbols using biblical criteria, rather than relying on modern or secular interpretations, to avoid confusion. The core of the lecture focuses on King Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great statue from Daniel Chapter 2, which prophetically outlines the rise and fall of successive world empires: Babylon (gold), Media-Persia (silver), Greece (bronze), and Rome (iron). Veith meticulously traces historical events that align with these prophetic kingdoms, culminating in the divided nations of modern Europe (iron and clay feet). The lecture concludes by highlighting the divine intervention of a \"rock\" (representing Jesus Christ) that will ultimately destroy all earthly kingdoms and establish God's eternal kingdom, providing a message of hope amidst a world of deception and conflict.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 204 The Mists of Time Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=101lFs23VxM\n\n\n\n(00:00) thank you foreign I've titled tonight's lecture in The Mists of time and that's a nice sort of Misty background over there the midst of time is a lecture on Daniel chapter 2. I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done Isaiah 46 chapters\n\n(01:31) verses 9 and 10. so God says I will tell you ahead of time what will happen from the beginning right until the end of time and in Daniel we have a key to the Book of Revelation in fact the two books Daniel and Revelation go hand in hand the symbolism that we find in the Book of Revelation is actually borrowed from the whole of\n\n(01:57) the Bible but the images are borrowed from The Book of Daniel specifically Jesus says in Matthew 24 when he was questioned about the signs of the end that we should study the Book of Daniel in particular it states that in Matthew 24 and of course in the Book of Revelation It also says blessed are they who read\n\n(02:23) and take to heart what is written in this prophecy so God declares I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done either this is so or this is not so now there are many symbolic symbols used in the Bible and we can get very confused\n\n(02:47) if we don't apply the right principles to what we are listening to you have to apply biblical criteria in order to understand Bible prophecy we cannot just take a symbol out of the air for example the Bible speaks about a beast in Revelation it talks about a beast it talks about a mark of a beast it talks\n\n(03:15) about something that must be put into the hand and into the forest and this represents the mark of the beast for example well what is the Beast you can do anything with that word Beast you could say like many in the world say today the Beast is a computer some say even which one they say it is a computer in Brussels\n\n(03:38) well does the Bible say beasts are computers yes or no you have to stick to biblical criteria the Bible uses symbols of animals it uses for example lions and bears and things like that now there are sports teams that are known as the Lions the British Isles Rugby Football team is known as the Lions so I'm not to read into the Bible that\n\n(04:07) the British Rugby Football team is going to play an important part at the end of time just because it says the Lions or the Bears that's another sporting team is that going to be a criterium of course not we have to use biblical criteria in order to deal with Biblical things so I've put together a little dictionary\n\n(04:28) here of prophetic terms where they are defined in the Bible and we have to use the Bible definitions for example white linen is righteousness Revelation 19 verse 8 the white linen you saw represents the righteousness of the Saints a trumpet or a wind or symbols of war in the Bible Revelation 49 36 that is now\n\n(04:53) in a prophetic sense prostitution I wonder how many sermons have been preached about licentious women and prostitution and all of these things when in actual fact God uses the word prostitute in a prophetic sense to refer to idolatry being unfaithful to God and they are just numerous texts that are listed here which show that\n\n(05:19) idolatry is prostitution God even had a cryptic lesson for Israel he even had a prophet of his marry a prostitute to give an object lesson of the unfaithfulness of the people of Israel towards their God water or sea in the Bible represents Nations when it's in a prophetic sense the waters you saw are peoples and\n\n(05:48) Nations and multitudes and Kings Revelation 17 verse 5 a woman in the Bible is a church Ephesians 5 22 to 24 second Corinthians Jeremiah Isaiah Hosea John all of them refer to the symbolism of a woman representing the church Christ is the bridegroom the church is his bride Zion is a symbol of God's people Isaiah\n\n(06:21) 51 16 and a beast in the Bible in a prophetic sense is a kingdom Daniel chapter 7 verse 17 says and the beasts which you saw are kingdoms or Kings and a king stands for a kingdom so it's not a football team and it's not a computer it's a kingdom that's it so if someone has a mark of the beast then it is a mark of a kingdom\n\n(06:54) that's what it means cannot mean anything else we have to stay with the Bible a horn in the Bible also represents a king or a kingdom so out of a kingdom can arise a number of horns that means the kingdom will disintegrate and many kingdoms will arise out of that Kingdom a rock in the Bible The Rock in the\n\n(07:19) Bible is Jesus that's what we sang in our theme song now there's a war between Good and Evil on this planet and if someone doesn't want to believe that switch on your television and have a look and you will see that there's a war between good and evil there's a war over every single soul on this planet whether\n\n(07:42) we want to acknowledge it or whether we don't now a very interesting little key story in the Bible is Daniel chapter 2 where King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and in this dream he dreams of certain events which shall unfold but he forgets the dream and then he is very confused and the prophet eventually unfolds the\n\n(08:09) dream for him and in the Stream we can pick up some very interesting road signs of history and time now Nebuchadnezzar also known as Nabu kuduri usur was the founder of the great Babylon the original founder of Babylon was of course Nimrod and then it had a period of greatness under hamurabi and then Nebuchadnezzar built it up to the\n\n(08:42) glory of the Chaldeans the greatest City that ever existed on the face of the planet so Nebuchadnezzar was very very proud of his achievements Jerusalem was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BC and during this time captives were taken to Babylon and amongst them were of course the Hebrew faithful such as Daniel and his friends\n\n(09:14) and here we see a relief of the captives actually being taken to Babylon as slaves many of them when they were caught they were made eunuchs to serve the king but well to be eunuchs for the rest of their lives never to have the honor or the pleasure of having children so there were terrible times in those\n\n(09:44) days these young men according to the biblical story were then enrolled in the Institutes of Higher Learning they went to the university and they studied the language and they studied the wisdom of the Chaldeans is a site of Nebuchadnezzar's Summer Palace here it is for example and the word Babel Has a very interesting common\n\n(10:12) connotation Bob a portal and Al is God so the word Babel Babel means a portal to God now the Bible says there is someone else who calls himself the door and that is Jesus Christ he says I am the door so Jesus is actually saying I am the Bob the gate through which one must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus says I\n\n(10:49) am the door and nobody comes to the father except through me so that is the door the entryway into heaven Bob Al represents another entryway another door whereby you try to climb into Heaven by another way another door a babilu is then also a portal the King was divine in the old days although the Babylonian and\n\n(11:19) Assyrian Kings did not go that far they were high priests generally so in Daniel chapter 2 we read now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's Reign Nebuchadnezzar had dreams now here we have a problem immediately we have a problem and the higher critics have such fun with verses such as these you see a\n\n(11:44) little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing so the higher critics complained about this text because it says in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's Reign but then a little bit further on it says in the third year of Daniel's captivity and Daniel had completed three years of study when this took place and\n\n(12:09) Nebuchadnezzar and these captives started off at the same time so they were saying well how's this possible you know Nebuchadnezzar's in his second year and the others are in their third year the Bible is pathetic makes simple mistakes like that but then of course they didn't realize that the two systems the Hebrew system of\n\n(12:31) counting was totally different to the Babylonian system when a Babylonian King ascended to the throne his first year was not counted it was known as the year of Ascension so the second year of his Reign would be the third year according to the Babylonian system and God does not acknowledge it when he speaks about his\n\n(12:53) Hebrew worthies he sticks to his system where any part of a year was considered as a completeness any part of a day was considered as a completeness that explains many things for example the crucifixion three days three days and anybody who wants to work it out will say now hang on a second if he Jesus died on Friday towards Sunset\n\n(13:21) and he stayed in the grave during the Sabbath and he rose on the first day of the week that doesn't make three days in our Reckoning today but in the Hebrew mindset which is inclusive Reckoning it does because any part of the day will count as day one so because it was before sunset on Friday that's day one\n\n(13:45) and it was a complete day in the grave that's day two and any portion of the day on the third day is day three so that is in the biblical record three days three evening mornings three days nights so no anomaly here just Reckoning according to the right systems and his Spirit was so troubled that his sleep\n\n(14:13) left him so the king summoned The Magicians the enchanters the sorcerers and the astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed and when they came in and stood before the king he said to them now you know in our modern times we believe how primitive here the man has a dream and he summons the enchanters and\n\n(14:38) the sorcerers and the astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed now that's what Kings and ancient days did they were surrounded by these wise Insider knowledgeable ones and each one of these categories had a certain function the enchanter would throw the charms and find out the sorcerer would be a deep occultist who would use occult\n\n(15:07) Communications to find out the astrologers would look at the stars to tell him what he had to do is it such an ancient custom or is it alive and well and living today in our Century yes or no do presidents of the United States make use of this system yes or no Ronald Reagan didn't do a move without consulting all of these categories\n\n(15:34) and Nelson Mandela in southern Africa will not make a move without having his son Gomez Come and throw the bones and the astrologists tell him what to do and the kings of Europe are no different they are occultists in that sense you can just study what the kingdoms do and what the kings and queens of England\n\n(15:56) do for example and how they communicate with the spirit world in order to find out what they should do does not Prince Charles consult mountbatten who is already dead when he has something important to do so all of these wise people came to the king and he said to them I've had a dream that troubles me and I want to\n\n(16:20) know what it means Daniel 2 1-3 the NIV the King James actually says this thing has gone from me which means I cannot remember it I cannot remember it but I know it was vitally important so please if you really are what you say then you must tell me what this means the king answered and said to the Chaldean this\n\n(16:46) thing is gone from me if you will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof you shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a downhill ancient Kings had much power when a king spoke that was it you remember the Book of Esther if the king did not hold out his staff to whoever came in that person was dead\n\n(17:12) he was dead he was killed on the spot he was taken out and executed if the king didn't give him the right to enter and to speak verse 10 says the Chaldeans now who are the Chaldeans the Chaldeans are the Learned ones those are the Highly Educated ones the astronomers the brilliant ones and we have Chaldeans\n\n(17:38) today some religious orders concentrate their most intellectual most educated people in the world into certain orders which actually run many of our universities and the very top universities in the world the highest universities that we have in the world today are run by categories of people that today would be the exact\n\n(18:08) equivalent of the Chaldeans nothing has changed so these are the educated ones answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the Earth that can show the king's matter therefore there is no King Lord nor ruler that asks such a thing and any magician or astrologer or Chaldean see the different categories all of them\n\n(18:31) were not able to do this it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there's none other that can show it before the king except the Gods whose dwelling is not with flesh so God actually removed this thing from this king's mind so that he would not be able to just recall it and also to expose all of these categories of people\n\n(18:59) verse 12 for this cause the King was angry and very Furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon or now obviously that included all of those that had received this Higher Learning which would then have included Daniel and his friends because they had completed their education at the Babylonian Institute of Higher Learning\n\n(19:25) so all of them were sentenced to death on one day just because they could not answer the dream when Daniel heard that they were all going to be put to death he went to Ariel the King's Guard and said is there any way that I could speak to the king and after he had given permission Daniel returned to his house and explained the\n\n(19:47) matter to his friends hanania Mikhail and Azaria mishael very interesting names here actually we haven't got time to go into all the details but there's even a typology in the name of events as they will unfold Daniel 2 17 and 18 He urged them to plead for Mercy from the god of Heaven concerning this mystery so\n\n(20:12) that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon that's the basic story behind the story in Daniel 2 21 we have this statement and he God changes the times and the seasons he removes Kings and sets up Kings so it's going to be a story of how kingdoms will arise and kingdoms will disappear on\n\n(20:42) this planet Daniel 2 24 tells us of how the king is then informed that Daniel actually has an answer do not execute the wise men of Babylon Take Me To The King and I will interpret his dream for him see God in night vision gave Daniel not only a description of the dream but also the solution to the dream\n\n(21:09) the king asked Daniel also called the belt sassar which is of course his name given to him in place of Daniel judgment so the whole book of Daniel is about judgment it's about the final Judgment of this planet and the Judgment of the various kingdoms as we go along bell sassa bell was the god of the\n\n(21:37) Chaldeans are you able to tell me what I saw in my dream and interpreted Daniel 2 26 did Daniel say yes I can yes I can no he didn't goddess to protect so ballet Bell is a male deity ballot is a female deity whether they were male or female they were interchangeable that's an interesting thought we will go into\n\n(22:10) that in Greater detail in the future Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the King has demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers The Magicians the soothsayers it's fascinating to me that every single one of these categories exists today and is being used by the world today and by\n\n(22:32) the leadership of the world today but there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets and maketh known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the when latter days Daniel 2 27 28 So Daniel chapter 2 is a book for our time it's for our time it gives something for all ages but the climax of History the\n\n(22:59) Danielle the Judgment the final judgment comes in our time isn't it surprising that people say cut the Old Testament off we don't need it anymore well Jesus said when you see these things when you see the Abomination that causes desolation standing here then let the reader of Daniel understand speaking about the future\n\n(23:26) Jesus himself points to Daniel and it concerns our time and he doesn't take the credit he gives the credit to God you see there are two religious systems on this planet the one system is man centered and the other is god-centered and that is the battle for every person's soul on this planet and you will be surprised\n\n(23:51) who today Advocates a man-centered religion you will be surprised I'll put them up on the screen one after the other for you as we go on Daniel 2 29 as you were lying there O King your mind turned to things to come and the reveal of mysteries showed you what is going to happen and this is basically what he dreamed\n\n(24:26) he saw a statue with a head of gold silver arms and chests bronze and this head of gold was very magnificent two arms hips of bronze legs of iron two legs and then feet of iron and clay and then he saw a rock hurdle towards Earth strike the statue and destroy it and it struck at the feet nowhere else\n\n(25:05) it struck at the feet well what does this dream mean well the Bible is so kind as to tell us exactly what it means so we don't even have to guess you looked okay and there before you stood a lot statue an enormous dazzling statue awesome in appearance that's what he dreamed and you saw this rock come\n\n(25:30) Daniel 2 verses 32 to 33. the head of the statue was made of pure gold its chests and arms of silver its belly and thighs of bronze its legs of iron its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay so it was a look into the future and it also concerned the last days while you were watching a rock was cut out notice\n\n(26:02) carefully but not by human hands so this intervention is not a human intervention but what kind of an intervention it's a divine intervention it struck the statue on its feet please be very careful it does not strike the statue on the hips are you with me it does not strike the statue on the hips now why would I emphasize that is\n\n(26:34) that important yes it happens to be important because whole religious systems in the world out there have the statue strike the hips when the statue is not struck at the hips the rock strikes the feet The Rock does not strike the hips so already just with a simple analogy half of the religious world out there\n\n(27:01) Christian religious world has something wrong seriously wrong all right that's what the Bible says check it out for yourself it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them Daniel 2 34. so who is this rock obviously if it's not a human intervention it's a divine intervention so if you are expecting some aid from\n\n(27:30) some superpower whichever that superpower may be I have news for you the final intervention is a divine intervention it is the second coming of Christ then notice the iron the clay the bronze the silver the gold were broken to pieces now hang on a second if this statue is sequential why when you strike the feet\n\n(28:02) is the iron that's the legs the clay that's the feet and the iron the bronze that's the hips the silver that's the chest and the gold broke into pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer why is the whole lot destroyed when it strikes the fit you see if these kingdoms occur one\n\n(28:31) after the other then does this make any sense yes it does but only if the philosophy of the head Advanced and built out in the philosophy of the chest increased greatly in the philosophy of the hips and incorporated into the philosophy of the iron and disseminated to the world in the philosophy of the iron and clay\n\n(29:01) when that philosophy is finally destroyed all of History's contribution to the kingdom of the other party the enemy of God come to an end everything do we today teach Babylonian philosophy yes we do yes we do I have a lecture called the wine of Babylon you will be stunned how much Babylonian philosophy\n\n(29:29) we teach do we teach middle Persian philosophy absolutely we do is the religion of miterism alive and well and living in the world today yes the greatest religious power in the world the most powerful religious power in the world teaches metrizism very interesting that's me the person do we have Greek philosophy in the world\n\n(29:53) today absolutely where's the where does the theory of evolution come from and start with Aristotle where do our modern and where does our modern thinking on just about every science in the world come from It's Greek philosophy what about the iron do we have anything to do with Roman teachings absolutely our entire judicial\n\n(30:16) system is based on Roman thinking which has incorporated all those others and the feet of iron and clay they are just The Heirs of a system gone before the wind swept them away without leaving a trace this is very important wind is a symbol of war war will this Final War will totally destroy the kingdoms of\n\n(30:41) Earth but the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain mountain is a symbol in the Bible of a kingdom and filled how much of the Earth the whole earth there won't be different nations anymore like we have today so if you have your hopes on any one of them forget it this this prophecy says no\n\n(31:05) Daniel 2 35. Isaiah 65 17 for behold I create a new Heaven and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered or come to mind and then he interprets the dream thou O King and he was the king of Babylon he stood for Babylon are to King of Kings very interesting Nuance here in the Bible lowercase k lowercase k\n\n(31:32) wow there's another king of kings who is uppercase K lowercase k who's that that's Jesus he's king of kings and Lord of lords here's another one that calls himself king of kings and he was known as king of kings he was the King of Kings the ruler is there another Power today that has a title an official\n\n(31:59) title King of Kings the answer is yes there is a power today so mighty so invasive in the world that it would surprise us and the title that it Bears is King of Kings Babylonian philosophy living today for the god of Heaven has given thee a kingdom power and strength and Glory You O King are a king of kings lowercase\n\n(32:30) k you are this head of gold and after thee shall arise another what Kingdom inferior to thee to thee Daniel 2 39 so Babylon will fall and will be replaced by another kingdom inferior gold is a precious metal Silver is a less precious metal but silver is harder than gold so the ultimate philosophy of a king of\n\n(33:03) kings was in the head of gold the ultimate philosophy of Bob Al another portal to heaven was in the gold it was strengthened in the next Kingdom although it became more brutal and less refined its chest and arms of silver there are two components to a chest and to a arm and there will be two components to the\n\n(33:29) next Kingdom as well the whole earth prostrate at her feet Babylon was never to dissipate was never to be destroyed Nebuchadnezzar thought he had built up a kingdom that would never go away here is an inscription that was found sealed by a seal of Nebuchadnezzar where it says may It Last Forever he could not conceive of a kingdom that\n\n(33:54) would be destroyed but Daniel pointed to him and he said to him the kingdom will disappear your kingdom will disappear this proud ruler said whoa whoa never and what did he do after he had humbled himself at first later on he hardened his heart and he thought to himself never I will defy the king of kings\n\n(34:19) my kingdom of gold will never be destroyed never will it go to Silver to bronze to iron to iron and Clay never it'll stand forever build me a statue pure gold head to foot what was he saying what was he saying when he was doing that he was defying the god of Heaven he was saying I defy you I will set up my\n\n(34:47) kingdom and you will not destroy it is it possible that there is a power today that is saying the same thing I defy you I will set up a kingdom and it will not be destroyed is it possible we'll see it's more than possible it's more than possible it's a sad reality in the world we're living to today so this\n\n(35:07) King might have been arrogant at that stage but there's an equally arrogant power today doing the same thing Daniel 3 16-18 replied to the king of Nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter if we are thrown into the Blazing furnace the God we serve is able to save us from it and he will\n\n(35:30) rescue us from your hand oh King but even if he does not we want you to know our King that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up so he called everyone including the Hebrews who had interpreted this vision for him and said Bow Down when you hear the sound of the music and the horn and\n\n(35:51) the sitter and the liar and all kinds of music Bow Down is music and instrument used today to get Nations together yes or no is it wow it surely is so these three said we will not bow down and even if he does not help us we will not bow down who else says that job said that job had that kind of Faith job said\n\n(36:19) even if he slay me yet will I serve him wow that's great so they were thrown into the fiery furnace and what happens the chords burn away the soldiers that throw them in are burnt to death and Daniel 3 26 Nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the Blazing furnace and shouted Servants of the most high God come out\n\n(36:47) come here because when he looked in he saw a fourth amongst them who looked King James version like the son of God other virgin versions who looked like a son of the Gods big difference between the two Daniel 3 28 Nebuchadnezzar said praise be to the god of shadrachment who has sent his Angel and rescued his\n\n(37:17) servants they trusted in him and defied the King's Command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any God except their own God so the Torah story tells us that Nebuchadnezzar was humbled did you know that Nebuchadnezzar is the only Heathen King who has the privilege of writing a\n\n(37:36) chapter in the Bible wow he got to write a chapter in the Bible the story of his conversion read it in the Book of Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar I believe will be in heaven one day because he was converted his pride was humbled but this is what it looked like it was a magnificent City here is the emblem of Babylon the lion\n\n(38:00) Hanging Gardens he built this for his wife amwaya who longed for mountains and here was a flat area she was not very happy so he said to her I'll build you a mountain and he built it for her you know those were Kings in those days they had power here is the famous Ishtar gate which you can still find in the pergaman\n\n(38:21) museum beautiful reliefs of the original Stones cuneiform writings that have been dug up tell the story of Nebuchadnezzar these portals for the astonishment of multitudes of people with beauty I adorned for the astonishment of men I have built this house he was the father and to balsasa the exalted son the\n\n(38:50) offering of my body the father of who belshasa isn't that interesting you see the higher critics here had some fun again the Bible talks about the final king of Babylon being belchasar and this critic said no no he wasn't king nabunidis was King but what they didn't realize not having the cuneiform writings to decipher at that stage was\n\n(39:15) that nabunidis had withdrawn himself into religious service he was a highly religious man and he served in the Babylonian priesthood and he gave the rulership to his son so this was an inscription that was found and to belshasa the exalted son the offering of my body do thou place the Adoration of the great deity in his heart may not\n\n(39:37) give way to sin may be satisfied with life's abundance and may reverence for the great Divinity dwell in his heart of belshasa my firstborn favorite son God speaks to Modern Man page 154 Bible Vindicated in 1882 an inscription was found confirming that nabunidas had left the kingship to his son in 1916 an inscription was found in\n\n(40:00) which there was a joint oath of belsasa and nabonitas there again the higher critics blew it the Bible was proved right 1924 they found the famous inscription I conferred kingship to my son belshasa bite the dust higher critics Bible wins round one for them nothing for that for the enemies of that and then the writing appeared upon the\n\n(40:25) wall and we hear the story of the old Prophet Daniel being called in to interpret the writing on the world many God has numbered your kingdom belshasa and finished it tickle you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting and Perez your kingdom has been divided and given to the medes and the Persians very\n\n(40:52) interesting two arms meats and Persians and the prophet interprets a writing written by a finger against the wall do you know that in the Bible there are only four times when God writes with his finger first time he writes The Ten Commandments with his finger the Bible says he wrote them on two tablets of\n\n(41:21) stone then Moses smashed them when he came down and found the Israelites in idolatry and then he hewed new stones and again God wrote with his finger what he had written on the first one and then here in Babylon at the fall of Babylon God wrote with his finger so God wanted to make very sure that everybody realized that he will bring\n\n(41:49) Babylon to an end wrote it with his finger and at the end the Bible says there is another kind of Babylon in the Book of Revelation which will come to an end just as surely and what's the fourth time when God wrote with his finger Jesus wrote with his finger in the sand interesting that's the only record we\n\n(42:17) have of Jesus writing something with his finger unwilling Babylon Jeremiah 51 9 we would have healed Babylon but she cannot be healed Revelation 2 21 I have given her time to repent of an immorality but she is unwilling there is ancient Babylon is modern Babylon who is this modern Babylon Bible names Cyrus\n\n(42:44) 150 years before his birth the prophet Isaiah in chapter 45 says thus says the Lord to his anointed to Cyrus whose right eye and I have Holden to subdue Nations before him and I will loose the loins of Kings to open before him the two Leaf Gates and the gates shall not be shut the Bible predicts this King\n\n(43:05) Cyrus would come and he would set free the Bible calls him the anointed one do you know that the Bible uses this terminology for Cyrus and it uses it for Jesus so this Heathen King here who brings to an end Babylon is used as a typology of the great king who will come and bring an end to final Babylon very interesting\n\n(43:34) analogy very interesting Cyrus cylinder with the whole story in cuneiform writing of how it happened I am Cyrus king of the world the great and just king king of Babylon king of Sumer and akat King of the four corners of the world son of cambisa's when I stepped into Babylon as a friend and ascended\n\n(43:54) the throne in its cheers of joy and pageantry in the governor's Palace my countless soldiers roamed Babylon in peace and sincerity I forbade harassment and Terror all over Sumer and akad I strove for peace in Babylon in all other cities I abolished forced labor in respect with citizens of Babylon which\n\n(44:13) was against their social status I helped restore destroyed houses I accommodated them again with with a peaceful place ducks and doves I tried to preserve their habitats see God is going to restore all things as well the Army marched in under the gates of Babylon they had been left open the river was diverted because God changes\n\n(44:38) times and seasons and removes Kings and sets up Kings and it's he who gives wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know not understanding that brought to an end the Babylonian Kingdom and now the next Kingdom is to come 539 BC to 331 BC the next Kingdom to rule the Earth the meter Persians came\n\n(45:07) to follow on after Babylon in Daniel chapter 2 verse 39 we read about this Kingdom in another kingdom a third Kingdom of bronze shall rule over all the Earth that's the next one to come I am persuaded that there was no Nation City nor people where his name did not reach there seems to me to have been\n\n(45:30) some Divine hand presiding both over his birth and actions Historical Library Book 16 chapter 12. so the Bible describes the rise of the middle Persian Empire and its fall to this Mighty King Alexander the Great who would destroy this Army do you know that Alexander destroyed the middle Persian armor army\n\n(45:53) with an army of only forty five thousand soldiers and the media Persians had an army of one million soldiers he flattened them he was a great strategist and knew exactly what he was about so the Greek Empire followed upon the medo-persian Empire the media Persian Empire contributed to the religion of Babylon\n\n(46:17) it took the religion of Babylon a refined it in the mithraic system which it handed over to the next generation and mitraisum then resurfaces later as a prominent Insider religion of the elite of Rome very interesting story but the Greek philosophy was the great foundation stone for many many philosophies in the world today\n\n(46:44) so Greeks follows on the medo-persian empire finally after the Greek Empire Daniel 2 40 there will be a fourth Kingdom strong as iron now if we look at the soldiers as they were in the ancient days Greece and Rome are very interesting comparison here is the Armory of the Greek soldiers notice that it's bronze that was their armor\n\n(47:15) they used bronze and then came the Roman soldier here's a Roman Legionnaire and what was their armor iron isn't that interesting so even this symbolism is fascinating so we switch from bronze to iron and the Legionnaire had a fantastic Armory it had this little belt here in the front to protect and the shield that protected\n\n(47:42) even the soldiers the shoulders of the soldiers I have to watch my esses here and this short stubby sword they were a tremendous force and of course the power of Rome was unparallel iron is harder than bronze Rome was mightier in its power than the Greeks were here are some of the ruins of the Roman\n\n(48:10) Empire the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron Breakers in pieces and subdues all things and as iron that breaks all these shall it break in pieces and Bruise Daniel 2 40. so this is a cruel Kingdom but whether Romans particularly cruel what did they do to anyone that dissented what happened to\n\n(48:30) them they crucified them that was pretty harsh at the fall of Jerusalem for Miles they were just crucifixes crucifixes everybody was just crucified you didn't mess with robe on June 22 168 BC at the Battle of pitna versus king of Macedonia was completely crushed by the armies of Rome on this day perished the Empire of Alexander the\n\n(48:57) Great 144 years after his death so there it perished so the famous historian Edward Gibbon says the images of gold silver brass that might serve to represent the Nations and their kings were successively broken by the iron monarchy of Rome the history and Decline and fall of the Roman Empire the whole world agrees that\n\n(49:23) Ayan was the kingdom of Rama in the second century hippolytus wrote of Rome Rejoice blessed Daniel thou Hast not been in error already the iron rules did you know that when Alexander the Great marched into Jerusalem the scribes marched towards him with the Torah and said to him you will rule Daniel said you will conquer\n\n(49:50) and because of that Alexander did not destroy Jerusalem but just Incorporated them the Bible says ahead of time who would Rule now many a Critic has come up and said more but surely Daniel must have lived after the events the Bible is wrong you know that the Bible has been Vindicated on that score because the Dead Sea Scrolls\n\n(50:15) have portions of the Book of Daniel where it changes from Aramaic to Hebrew that little piece is there and when they study the Aramaic which they said was late Aramaic oops what did they find in the Dead Sea Scrolls that it was medo Persian Aramaic so the Book of Daniel is authenticated from that time\n\n(50:42) right up until all these events are described so it was written all ahead of time you cannot mess with the Bible you cannot mess with it so this Mighty power Rome came to destroy historian Charles Rollins says they the Romans seized indiscriminately all provinces and kingdoms and extended their empire of all nations in a word\n\n(51:06) they prescribed no other limits to their vast projects than those which deserts and seas made it impossible to pass ancient history volume 4 79 so from 168 BC to 476 A.D Rome the iron monarchy ruled Supreme now there were two legs of iron that's interesting Rome was split into two halves the Eastern Empire and the Western Empire\n\n(51:36) and the emperor for many years after Constantine ruled from the Eastern Byzantine Empire he ruled the whole Kingdom but Western Rome followed another path very interesting story that we have just as you saw says Daniel 2 41. that the feet and Toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron so are there elements\n\n(52:05) of Rome in the feet and in the toes yes or no absolutely still there the iron is still there the iron isn't gone so this will be a divided Kingdom is the world trying to restore the Holy Roman Empire yes or no what is the unification of Europe all about have you thought about that so this will be a divided Kingdom Daniel\n\n(52:34) 2 42 as the toes were partly iron and partly clay so this Kingdom will be partly strong partly brittle has history proved that the nations of Europe were sometimes strong and sometimes weak and sometimes one ruled and sometimes another wasn't Germany Mighty and France Mighty and Britain Mighty yes or no\n\n(52:58) didn't the Danes rule for a while etc etc etc wasn't the Austrian Empire the mighty at one stage with its Kingdom absolutely so history has proved that right Jeremiah 18 6 like clay in the hand of the Potter so are you in my hand o House of Israel these kingdoms might be arrogant but they would be replaced\n\n(53:27) they would be divided and they would be divided into 10. that's what the Bible says they would be ten toes that would come forth now these ten toes are very interesting where do these ten toes arise in the Western Empire or in the Eastern Empire very important question and the Bible tells us quite plainly\n\n(53:54) that they arise in the Western Empire and that the Western Empire would exert an influence over the entire world does the Western Empire exert its influence over the entire world yes or no absolutely it is European knowledge and wisdom that was transported to the entire world it was Europeans that conquered South\n\n(54:26) America it is from the Western European nations that the United States and Canada and all its components was incorporated into that wisdom that philosophy it is Western ideology which comes from European stock which is controlling world events the superpowers today have all can all Trace their roots\n\n(54:54) to Western Europe so who were these Anglo-Saxons and Franks and alemani and lombos and ostrogoths and nuruli and burgundians and Visigoths and swabian vandals who were they so this is the division of the Western Roman Empire and notice that there is a very interesting Nation over here which is known as the ostrogoths and then\n\n(55:19) there is another Nation over here which is known as the Visigoths they were the burgundians and they were the Franks and the Anglo-Saxons and the Franks and the Romans had a very strong Alliance at one stage the ostrogoths and the Visigoths they had a slightly different religion to the rest of Europe and there were\n\n(55:42) many many many many wars that were fought over this issue so the alimani today are the Germans the Germans are the remnant of the alamani the Swiss the baganians the French the Franks the Italians the Lombards the English the Saxons the Portuguese the swerve the Spanish the visicos but three of them\n\n(56:01) ruli the vandals and the ostrogoths are extinct they're gone they have been wiped out The ostrogoths The Lost Ones to be wiped out a mighty mighty nation that controlled all events in Rome they ruled over Rome itself the Visigoths were in Spain and they had a slightly different religion there were many many\n\n(56:29) many wars fought in Spain Spain was divided terribly divided into a northern and a southern half and terrible Bloodshed was found in Spain but the haruli and the vandals and the ostrogoths were totally destroyed history tries to tell us that these three were destroyed because they had a Aryan philosophy which means they\n\n(56:55) propagated the idea that Christ did not have divinity and that they were therefore destroyed but we only have information from One Source all their writings everything that they wrote has been destroyed all their libraries have been destroyed so we don't really know what they believe in actual fact the\n\n(57:19) ostrogoths probably received their religion from Palestine and had a very pure form of Christianity based on the Bible and that is why they were destroyed but I haven't got timing to go into that that would be a whole lecture a few lectures all by themselves so let's concentrate on this prophecy and whereas thou sourced iron mixed with\n\n(57:42) Miri clay they shall mingle themselves with a seed of men so originally when Rome fell it was divided into tens three of them were eventually destroyed today we have the remnants and they would mix themselves with the seed of men they would try to reunite it by intermarriage but they shall not cleave one to another\n\n(58:02) even as iron is not mixed with Clay Daniel 2 verse 43. so we had the great Kings of Europe trying to unite Europe through marriage and so we have Queen Diana and King Frederick trying their utmost to bring the Nations together yes Fredericksburg Castle in Denmark from where the the famous kings and queens\n\n(58:27) ruled Daniel 2 43 where Asta saws iron mixed with Miracle they shall mingle themselves with the Seas of men they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with Clay there you have the famous Queen Victoria and King Christian did you know that Queen Victoria was totally unenglished did you know that she was German\n\n(58:51) did you know that you even spoke German on her death bed when she was dying her mother tongue came back she was a German Queen and King Christian of Denmark and her Offspring mingled with the seeds of men all the nations United they were all together so different Kings tried to reunite the kingdoms here you have the pope crowning Charles\n\n(59:19) the great Charlemagne King of the Holy Roman Empire because supposedly he had managed to reunite Europe and as that Crown went on to his head the kingdom fell apart and divided so for a brief moment they'd come together again and then they fell apart and so the chances and the Louise and all these kingdoms of the earth and\n\n(59:45) the great kingdoms tried to reunite Europe and then came this Frenchman Napoleon Bonaparte his brother was the Grand Master of Freemasonry in Spain very interesting he was the Grand Master and all of these had Insider connections and he wanted to reunite Europe and at the Battle of Waterloo well he met his Waterloo very\n\n(1:00:16) interesting history we'll be talking about this in some more detail because everything we hear is not necessarily what is truth yeah Napoleon is taken into exile Napoleon said I wanted to found the European system a European code of laws a European Court of Appeals there would have been but one people\n\n(1:00:39) throughout Europe would soon have become one nation The Watchman 1941. he tried to reunite it 30 years after Waterloo Dr Thomas Arnold said the Deliverance of Europe from the Dominion of Napoleon was affected neither by Russia no by Germany nor by England but by the hand of God what was the principal adversary of this\n\n(1:01:06) tremendous Power by whom was it checked and resisted and put down by none and by nothing but the direct and manifest interposition of God lectures on modern history lecture three it's very interesting Napoleon had very heavy artillery and he would have outgunned the much lighter artillery of the British for\n\n(1:01:27) example but on that day suddenly a fine rain fell and all his Heavy Artillery became bogged down in the mud and they couldn't move it and so the lighter more mobile artillery of the other forces was just what was needed to blow them to Smithereens so who won the battle the weather or the artillery it's interesting that some great\n\n(1:01:56) politicians in the past have said history is on the side of the greatest artillery the heaviest artillery but there is a God in heaven that reveal a secret makes known to the King Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days this is an interesting verse Daniel 2 28 the latter days well if you read your Bible if you read\n\n(1:02:19) Luke and Matthew 24 Luke chapter 21 you will see the events as they unfold how one Kingdom after the other will make war and the very final events will be Nation against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom Wars famines all kinds of things Hearts failing for fear that's what the Bible says and the next event will be\n\n(1:02:47) says that Matthew 24 and Luke 21 the coming of Christ in glory the stone that will bring an end to all the Earthly kingdoms this was Kaiser Wilhelm he tried to bring an end to the division and here's a very interesting true story at a cathedral in France in Mets there's a statue outside the cathedral the\n\n(1:03:13) statue over here of the Prophet Daniel with his finger pointing to his scroll very interesting prophets uh Prophet here and Kaiser Wilhelm he was very concerned about the Statue and then one day the cathedral needed repair the roof had become it fell apart and it had to be replaced and so they asked Kaiser Wilhelm for the\n\n(1:03:41) money to repair the cathedral and Kaiser Wilhelm said the following he said you have a statue in front of your Cathedral of Daniel so obviously he knew what Daniel said and obviously he was annoyed by the prophecy so he said I will give you the money to repair your Cathedral if you remove his head now remember\n\n(1:04:03) these statues are in sections and put my head on top of the statue do you think they did it this is history you can check it out do you think they did it yes they did it they did it and they put the head of the original Daniel into the archives and he replaced the roof and so for a while Gaza villain's head was on the\n\n(1:04:28) Statue what was he trying to say he was like Nebuchadnezzar evolved he was saying I don't care what your Prophet said I will do it isn't that what he was saying I don't care what your Prophet said I will do it a fascinating history well here he is dead but this is not him this is his dog Center but glad to design in my estate in\n\n(1:04:53) Kaiser his dog accompanied the Kaiser during the first world war 1914-1918 and then eventually another would arise Daniel 2 21 and he changes times and seasons and removes Kings and set his up Kings and if you Kaiser Wilhelm think that you can put your head on the Statue of Daniel saying I will do it my way and you God will not have any\n\n(1:05:22) influence of it you'll be dead and it won't work and there was the next one now here's a fascinating story here was another man do you think he understood the Prophecies of Daniel do you think he was interested Adolf Hitler was interested in the occult world like no other before him there were two who were highly\n\n(1:05:46) interested in the occult world the one was Napoleon Napoleon in fact sent his whole one of his whole Army cores to Egypt to go and find out the source of the power of the Pharaoh that threw his staff and it turned into snakes did you know that and it is the French who discovered what in Egypt the Rosetta Stone\n\n(1:06:19) from which all the hieroglyphics have been unfathomed isn't that an amazing story and they studied the secrets of the power of the Egyptians and in the occult world this knowledge is Incorporated in the Hermetic books they studied the origin of ham hermese son of her son of ham and the Occult knowledge and they compiled huge volumes\n\n(1:06:51) on the history of Egypt this man over here was an occultist of the highest order he was an Insider initiate in the occultism did you know that the entire SS was built up on occult principles did you know that and isn't it interesting that he sent an entire division to where to Egypt and that the German archaeologists were\n\n(1:07:18) the one who did the great dicks under the protection of Rommel and there The Insider knowledge was gathered of the occult principles which dictate many a king and ruler today we're going to talk about some very interesting things in this series Adolf Hitler knew about the prophecy of Daniel how do we know\n\n(1:07:44) he gave an interesting instruction he contacted the Cathedral at Mets and said remember that you have Kaiser willem's head on that statue take it off put the head of Daniel back what was he saying what was he saying Daniel's head went back onto the statue he was saying with or without that head I'll do it\n\n(1:08:11) wow fascinating stuff history is more interesting than we believe really it is Jamaican in a study of the occult world and how it has influenced our great political leaders in the past you'll be surprised and here Adolf Hitler came and here's the symbol that is used the swastika which is the symbol of sun worship it's\n\n(1:08:36) the symbol of Lucifer it is used by the theosophy society which says Lucifer is the logos the serpent the Savior exactly the same symbol is used by theosophy and theosophy is a dead oh no theosophy is alive and well and forms the central theme of the greatest powers that rule the world today and we will revealing some of these\n\n(1:09:03) things in the lectures to come this is interesting stuff the ego used as the symbol of deity you see the Bible uses the eagle as the symbol of God Like an Eagle that rises up I will take you under my wings that is the symbol of God Lucifer wants to be like the most high he takes the symbol of the ego which was a symbol in\n\n(1:09:26) Egypt of Horus fascinating and there it is the eagle with the swastika and the swastika can be left-handed swastika or a right-handed swastika if it is a left-handed or the right-handed it makes no difference it represents the god in his evil and in his light form or in his male or in his female form it doesn't matter which one\n\n(1:09:51) you use secret societies today use the very one in the mirror image today and say but it's something else it's not something else Buddhism uses that symbol Buddhism the foot of Buddha has swastikas under every single toe it's just the reverse one makes no difference it's just the other six of the deity\n\n(1:10:11) that is being honored so what is happening here to the world is there an agenda behind the scenes what is this circle and the swastika really mean regarding the first world war Winston Churchill said after the end of the World War of 1914 was Winston Churchill a member of a secret fraternity yes or no\n\n(1:10:33) yes he was isn't that fascinating was Stalin a member of a secret fraternity yes or no yes he was well maybe history is not as boring as you thought young guys isn't that so I was thought history was boring when I was a kid but today I find it fascinating putting the pieces together wow regarding the\n\n(1:10:56) first world war Winston Churchill said after the end of the world The War of 1914 there was a deep conviction and almost Universal hope that peace would reign in the world the Gathering storm page three after the first World War that's interesting well did any of these great rulers whether it was the Kaiser villains or\n\n(1:11:21) the napoleons or the Louise or the Charles's or the Hitlers did they succeed no Europe was more divided after the war than before the war but that division was deceptive as we will see and then the walls came down and Empires started crumbling and the great people of the world the lenens and the starlings that had\n\n(1:11:48) murdered their Millions for very clandestine reasons suddenly these Empires crumbled the mawamus Fallen the wall Must Fall all of these great leaders from lechwaleza to this lady over here Thatcher to Khrushchev and Gorbachev and the Queens do they belong to secret orders do they who's the head of the boulder Burgers\n\n(1:12:18) who's the queen of the boulder burgers yes she is that's very interesting is there such a thing as a Gorbachev foundation with its seat in New York yes there is very interesting things and then the founder of the KGB comes down a symbol Falls does it really fall does it really fall who rules in Russia Today\n\n(1:12:47) who is the head of Russia Today Putin what was he he was the head of the KGB you see isn't that interesting so they take down a symbol and the people think the oppression is gone when the oppression is not gone at all it's just taken another robe it's like a chameleon changes color but the essence it doesn't change\n\n(1:13:12) and the god of Heaven is he watching yes the god of Heaven is watching he told us ahead of time it would happen and he told us in great detail Soviet Union no longer exists three republics unite Gorbachev obsolete Bush needs recovery time blah blah blah reading Europe's future can we all get along in the hands of the people\n\n(1:13:37) it's more than money monetary Union sea of troubles the currency storms blows European Unity of course lelandstyle said Humanity has been given a suspended sentence but it's days of grace are fearfully short while time remains page 343 the god of Heaven will set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed\n\n(1:14:02) it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever now I want you to think seriously tonight all those who are here present is the world preaching that we are heading towards the kingdom of peace yes or no yes but it will be a worldly Kingdom where do they want to set up a final\n\n(1:14:28) Kingdom of Peace up there somewhere in Jerusalem or they're fighting about it what does God say he will bring to an end what how many of the kingdoms on this Earth all of them that's what God says all of them and he will set up a kingdom do you think he needs the armies of the world to do it for him\n\n(1:14:52) everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to Pieces but he on whom it falls will be Crush that's what the Bible says for he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or Mourning or crying or pain for the old Order of Things has what passed away Revelation 21 4 we must not\n\n(1:15:21) be deceived into believing that the powers on this Earth are going to achieve the objective that they're fighting for they will not achieve it it will be brought to an end they will appear to achieve it how do we know that because the Bible says when they say peace peace when will the Nations on Earth say\n\n(1:15:50) that when they appeared to have obtained their objective isn't that right does the Bible say what will happen then sudden destruction and who will that Destruction come from it will come from God and why would the god of Heaven have to intervene to destroy that final Unity why would he have to do that because it is an occult\n\n(1:16:16) Unity it is a Unity against God it is an anti-christos Unity scary stuff the world is terribly deceived today we need to study these prophecies carefully and unfold them and unravel them and to see the finer nuances so that we cannot be deceived when a preacher stands up and says the Antichrist lived in the\n\n(1:16:44) past he was a Greek king his name was Antiochus epiphanus for but he was destroyed by The Rock hello the rock strucks the feet didn't strike the hips didn't strike a Greek king Daniel chapter 8 Daniel chapter 9. be careful how we interpret the prophecy we cannot have a wrong spin on this ball Christ will\n\n(1:17:14) return the rock of all ages verse 35 and the stone that smote the image became a great Mountain a mountain in the Bible a kingdom and filled the whole earth God himself is going to set up a kingdom the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof is sure Daniel 2 45. now we've had very little detail tonight\n\n(1:17:40) but we've had a pretty accurate sweep through history and would you agree that Daniel was just spot on yes or no absolutely Daniel was spot on I have sad news for you terribly sad news for you Daniel is going to take the picture tonight's picture was like a picture you give to a child to color in just the outline\n\n(1:18:09) and then you give the child the crayons and you say color in the picture now in our next lecture we'll do Daniel chapter 7. and we're going to color in the picture and then it gets scary because then we will see who the real power is and some of us will be hurt some of us will be shocked some of us may say I never want to hear\n\n(1:18:35) any more of this but I would encourage you to keep on coming because there is a fascinating solution to this did you know that the Book of Revelation takes this final great battle between good and evil which is a secret battle it's a secret battle the very first words Jesus uses when asked what is the sign of your\n\n(1:18:59) coming and the End of the Age the very first thing he says is be careful lest anyone deceive you deception is the name of the game are there wolves in sheep's clothing deceiving God's people is the world being led down some Garden Path Faithfully following thinking they are doing something good when they are being\n\n(1:19:25) led into the pits of hell is it possible if we believe the prophets and if we study them carefully and even if it hurts and believe you me I've stood on the other side of the fence and when I studied the prophecy I was hurt and my family was hurt and there were buckets of Tears but now I have buckets of Hope\n\n(1:19:54) buckets of Hope because God has shown me and has shown everybody in the world through his word and that's the only place where we can find it that there is hope but he is also outlined the entire deception of our time and we need to know there's a very small crowd here tonight very small crowd the whole world needs\n\n(1:20:21) to know what the deception is so I would like to encourage you to bring your friends and call them off the streets go to the highways go to the byways invite people to the wedding Feast of the Lamb not many rich not many wise not many of high repute will listen to you but going to the highways and byways and\n\n(1:20:42) bring them here and let's look at the prophecies and I make a vow to you if I speak anything that is contrary to the word of God leave if it doesn't say so leave test every word I say put it into the checks and balances use the word of God as your footer and if you can show me that I'm wrong I'll change I promise I don't want to do\n\n(1:21:13) anything that's not in line with God's will that's my challenge we will stick to the word of God and we will see exactly what's happening in our time it's scarier than you think but we have hope because the god of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed and we're right in front of\n\n(1:21:33) the door and I for one would like you all to be part of that Kingdom may God bless you and keep you until we come together for the coloring in episode of Daniel chapter 7. thank you

  "# Title:205_the_man_behind_the_mask_total_onslaught_walter_veith_thegreatcontroversy_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nProphetic interpretation,Antichrist identification,Roman Catholic Church,Biblical prophecy,End-time events\n\n## Guide:\nThis extensive lecture, titled \"The Man Behind The Mask,\" delves into biblical prophecy, primarily from the books of Daniel and Revelation, to identify a specific power or system that will play a major role in end-time events. The speaker systematically analyzes symbolic language, such as beasts representing kingdoms and horns representing kings, to trace a historical progression from ancient Babylon through Medo-Persia, Greece, and the Roman Empire. A central focus is placed on the \"little horn\" power, which arises from the divided Roman Empire and is characterized by its blasphemous claims of divine authority, persecution of \"saints,\" and attempts to \"change times and laws.\" The lecture asserts that historical events, particularly the rise of the Papacy and the duration of its temporal power, precisely fulfill these biblical predictions, arguing that the Roman Catholic Church, as a system, embodies this prophesied \"man of sin\" or Antichrist.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 205 The Man Behind The Mask Total Onslaught Walter Veith #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJwlMhMi6VY\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh the lecture tonight is titled the man behind the mask because we want to know who the man behind the scenes is that is going to play a major role in the events culminating in the very end event before the coming of Christ and the book of daniel gives us a lot of information on\n\n(01:30) this issue and in fact the book of daniel as we have said before forms the template for the book of Revelation and the prophecy that we will be going through tonight is a prophecy that acts as a key for the book of Revelation again I'd like to remind you of our little dictionary of prophetic turns white linen righteousness trumpet wind\n\n(01:59) is a symbol of war trumpet can also be a symbol of judgment prostitution is idolatry being unfaithful to God water el c equals nations revelation 17 5 a woman you will remember is a church Zion God's people tonight we're going to deal with beasts and kingdoms and we'll see the definitions there for ourselves and\n\n(02:25) horns and kings and kingdoms will see those definitions for ourselves as well and the rock is Jesus there are many many work text indicating that so let us have a look at this vision tonight of Daniel chapter 7 it's one of the most thunderous visions in the Bible it's really staggering and it's actually\n\n(02:50) quite scary in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon so this is right towards the end of the Babylonian Kingdom Daniel had a dream so now it's not the king who has a dream but Daniel who has a dream and obviously Daniel is going to get more detail than the King had in his previous vision which was the\n\n(03:14) sort of the ABC of prophecy he had a dream and a isn't of his head upon his bed and then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters so he's going to explain it we don't have to guess about this issue Daniel 7 vs 2 and 3 and I saw in my vision by night and behold before win what was that war of heaven strolls upon\n\n(03:41) the Great Sea so there was war among the nations and four great beasts kingdoms came up from the sea diverse from one another they were different to each other Daniel 7 verses 2 and 3 so now let's just make sure that we have this right Bible prophecy symbols remember the sea is people nations multitudes\n\n(04:11) revelation 17 15 wield we said was war Jeremiah 49 36 and 37 beefs or kingdoms Daniel 717 it's read those texts to make absolutely sure revelation 17 15 the waters which thou sawest or people's and multitudes and nations and tongues so is the first symbol let's go to Jeremiah and see what we can see here 49 verse 36\n\n(04:42) and upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them towards all those winds and there shall be no nation whether the outcasts of Elam shall not come verse 37 for I will cause alarm to be dismayed before their enemies now we call that Hebrew parallelisms something\n\n(05:06) is explained in one way and then repeat it in another way in that way the symbols are explained they are self-explanatory then so the four winds which scatter Elam it mean that Elam will be dismayed before their enemies there will be Wars and before them let's seek their life and I will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger says the\n\n(05:30) lord and i will send sword whoa after them till I have consumed them so there you have the parallel ISM that you can see that the C equals the nation's and the wind equals the wall Daniel 717 the full great beasts are four computers in Brussels oh no doesn't say that at all it says the four Great beasts are four kingdom that\n\n(06:00) will arise from the earth so four kingdoms are going to come and they described as be 17 23 the first beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon the earth so that's the biblical definition we cannot make it anything other than what the Bible says it's going to be so the four beasts or four kingdoms that\n\n(06:28) shall arise upon the earth and now we can look at the kingdom's and see where we are going the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings I'd be held till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon the feet as a man and a man hot was given to it Daniel 7 verse for\n\n(06:56) now the first Kingdom that we had in Daniel chapter 2 the head of gold Daniel identified it as well Babylon the first beast we see here is the lion with eagle's wings which by the way was the symbol one of the symbols of Babylon and what is fascinating here is that this beast was made to stand upon the feet as\n\n(07:23) a man and a man's heart was given to it this is a system a kingdom that exalts the human above the divine this is the ultimate apostasy against God putting and in the place where God should be and we will see as we continue in the series that end time events also culminate in this very matter man being placed where\n\n(08:01) the divine should be so Bob L as I've already said babe old Bob is gate L is God portal to God another way to God another way other than the prescribed way which we find in the Bible so here is this power that will arise and it stands for Babylon it's parallels the head of gold 6052 539 BC let's have a\n\n(08:34) look at your admirer for the symbolism Jeremiah 4 verse 7 a lion has come out of his lair a destroyer of Nations has set out he has left this place to lay waste your land the prophet is speaking to Israel Jerusalem your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitants and the lion he was referring to was the kingdom\n\n(08:58) of Nebuchadnezzar Babylon was going to come and Jeremiah applies the symbol of the lion to Babylon so the first kingdom is Babylon is a symbol that was used in Babylon you can see the lion with the eagle's wings part of that symbolism here's another release and they again you see the Lions with the eagles wings\n\n(09:26) symbols of Babylon so archaeology confirms that was the symbolism that was used so we do not have to guess at what was to transpire the Bible gives us a good start Daniel chapter 2 started with Babylon Daniel chapter 7 starts with Babylon and suddenly another beast replaced that with another word kingdom\n\n(09:52) a second like a bear it was raised up on one side and has three ribs in its mouth between its teeth and they said the stew it arrives devour much flesh Daniel 7 verse 5 so this beast is going to come and it's going to devour the flesh of the previous one it's going to make war and replace it and it has cerebral and one\n\n(10:27) side was higher than the other now what was the next Kingdom in Daniel chapter 2 it was medo-persia now we've little bit more detail here the Medes and the Persians once equally yoked at first the means with a prominent one and was raised up on one side later on the Persians rose to be the equivalent and\n\n(10:53) even higher so it was not equal in its power so the next kingdom to come along would be medo-persia three ribs in its mouth there were three major wars associated with that concrete so meter Persia represents is the parallel of the arms of silver and the chest and they ruled from 539 2 331 BC and there are\n\n(11:25) the thrusts that they made the one into Libya conquering these portions of the Babylonian Empire the other thrush to Babylon itself and the third one down into Egypt and they basically conquered the entire Babylonian Kingdom with these three conquests representing the three rooms in their mouth Daniel 7 verse 6\n\n(11:53) after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it for wings of a fowl the Beast had also for heads and Dominion was given to it so the next Kingdom to come along was Greece 331 to 168 BC and when Greece was at the height of its power Alexander the Great died after a night of drunken\n\n(12:25) stupor he lingered for a while and then died and the kingdom was divided into four the four generals Cassandra Lucy macos Ptolemy and seleucid kingdom that is the division of the greek empire into four fascinating so there were four heads so now we already have a total of six heads The Lion the bear plus the\n\n(12:50) fall make six after this Daniel 7 verse 7 I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible exceedingly strong it had huge iron teeth do you remember the symbol of iron where did we find it in Daniel chapter 2 and it was a symbol of the Roman Empire here we have the same symbolism it was\n\n(13:20) devouring breaking in pieces and trampling the residue with its feet here's this mighty empire politically the most powerful of the four and it would destroy and devour with its feet and there's something very interesting about it Daniel 7 verse 7 it was different from all the beats that were before it and it had ten horns right\n\n(13:50) there are no numbers of heads mentioned here so we assume another one head with ten or so if you count all the heads of the beasts of Daniel chapter 7 how many heads do we have we have seven heads seven hits now the beasts that we will find in the book of Revelation have seven heads and the beasts in the book\n\n(14:14) of Revelation with the seven heads also have all the compound of the beasts that are mentioned here in Daniel chapter 7 so we must know what each of these heads represent and what the philosophies were they were associated with those time periods now this particular beast was also different from all the beasts that were before it\n\n(14:41) and it had ten horns now the ten horns as we saw in the definitions would also be kingdoms verse 24 says and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten Kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them so after the ten had arisen after Rome had been divided into ten another one would arise and he shall be\n\n(15:17) diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings alright who is fascinating so the fourth beast divides into 10 but it's still basically that beast it's all that beast that divides into 10 and out of this beast amongst the division of the 10 comes another power and he is the one that adds the different flavor but clear there were\n\n(15:52) the texts he shall be diverse different from the first so Rome will be different to the others because of that beef and he will rule for how long until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints that's a long long time very long long time so wrong ruled from 168 BC to 476 ad it will divide\n\n(16:23) into 10 how many toes did the previous prophecy depict 10 goes there we have the 10 again divided into ten another will arise after them and he will be different and the system will remain how long until the Ancient of Days shall come who long time so we're talking about a long long time span run ruled for 168 BC to 476 ad and\n\n(17:00) then it was divided up so we have exactly the same sequence we have the lion or depicting the head of gold then we have the bear depicting the arms and the chest of silver we have the four-headed leopard representing the hips of bronze and then we have the terrible be representing the legs of iron and the ten toes when it divides\n\n(17:29) into ten-plus it will be different because of another that arises after them so that's what we have so far Daniel chapter 7 verse 19 to 20 and 23 then I would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse different from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass bronze so there was an element\n\n(18:01) of bronze in this force piece bronze was a very important component an actual fact the Greek Empire was basically just incorporated by Rome Greek philosophy was the very basis of the Roman Empire and in fact when Rome split into the two legs the one was the Byzantine Empire on the other one the Western Empire and the\n\n(18:30) Empire was ruled from Constantinople and that is where Greek philosophy abandoned Greek philosophy was the the philosophy of the time this element of broth of bronze bronze claws scratched and we'll find these nails also interestingly elsewhere later on which devoured broken pieces and stamped the residue with its feet so I\n\n(19:02) wanted to know about this terrible fourth Beast the false peace we are told in verse 23 shall be a force kingdom upon the earth which shall be different from all the kingdoms and shall devour how much of this the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces now did Rome in its original form\n\n(19:29) take over the whole world yes or no you know no what about China what about Japan what about the Philippines what about Australia what about southern Africa what about the United States what about South America what about those areas is wrong rule of all of those yes or no obviously not but remember the\n\n(19:53) prophecy doesn't say wrong end the prophecy says that Rome is divided into ten and that another arises after them who rules and two went until the Ancient of Days come so the prophecy can still be fulfilled in that context of Mexico what the Bible says they would be these kingdoms and ten horns would arise ten\n\n(20:25) kingdoms ten kingdoms represent the ten toes 476 until the second coming of Christ these powers would somehow continue and the little one after him that would arise later he would be the different elements and he would rule until the Ancient of Days came along Daniel 2 verse 44 remember talking about\n\n(20:55) the tenth oh which are the equivalent of the tinhorn says and in the days of these Kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall must be lived to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever now Daniel was wondering\n\n(21:20) about this and in verse 8 it says I was considering the horns so he's looking down the stream of time and he's looking to where wrong divides up into ten components and he's looking at these ten kingdoms that arise out of the Roman Empire and there was a another horn a little one actually it says from Little\n\n(21:48) Miss it was first small and then it grew bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger coming up where does it come up among them alright so this little lon comes up among the ten it's very important because this little horn is the man behind the mall and this little horn comes up amongst the king so the ten\n\n(22:12) kingdoms are there and he arises amongst them so what type of power is this this is a European power because the ten horns arose out of the Western Roman Empire so can we look for this little horn in the Middle East for example yes or no no can we look for this little horn in the United States of America for\n\n(22:40) example know where do we have to look for him there we supposed to arrive he has to come up among is the 10 you can comes up among the 10 and all pain are there when he arises notice before whom three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots so because of this power 3 of the in had to be removed does that make\n\n(23:12) sense well take three away and who is going to take them away or as a consequence of whom will they be removed this part very important that we get him absolutely spot-on because we don't want to make a mistake and they're in this horn where the eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth speaking pompous words\n\n(23:35) when did we find this symbolism earlier this man symbolism Babylon remember founded in Babylon here's the same symbolism in this power man will once again lift himself up above the most high and take the place of the Most High this is another bubble another portal to heaven man exalting himself above the\n\n(24:09) divine with pompous words he's speaking against God alright so now we have some history he arises out of the division of the Roman Empire once it is divided into 10 then only does he make his appearance three of them are bothersome to him they are eliminated under his influence and then he rises up like a mushroom and sex\n\n(24:41) man about the divine that's what it says and the ten horns out of this kingdom or ten Kings that shall arise and another there is shall rise after them question does he arise out of the remnant of the Roman Empire or out of the remnant of the Greek Empire roman empire Roman Empire don't forget that the stone also\n\n(25:12) struck the feet it's truck which Empire the Greek of the Roman Empire the Roman Empire so already if you know this you should be able to solve half of the problem of false prophecy out there in the world that says that the Antichrist will arise or arose in the past in the time of grief no no no the bible does not say\n\n(25:36) that the bible says he arises when once Rome is divided into its components that's what the Bible says and he ruled until the Ancient of Days come is he around here now well must he be here sure he must be here are people waiting for him sure what for is here we shouldn't have to wait we should just be\n\n(26:06) able to say there is it was very interesting so he shall be different from the first so the flavor of the fourth beast is made different by whom by him why different and he is the one that's responsible for removing three Old Kingdom well you remember the kingdom's the anglo-saxons the Franks are Lemanis the longboards the\n\n(26:35) Ostrogoths throughly the Burgundians the Visigoths the Syrian Randall those were as a 10 but there were some terribly opposed to this power number one their rule e ad 493 look where they ruled look with a rule now these people had an interesting philosophy and this philosophy differed substantially from\n\n(27:04) the philosophy of this other little horn power now unfortunately we have no historic documents as to what the he rule II believe neither do we have any historic documents as to what the Ostrogoths believe we have a little bit of what the Vandals believe but none of their religious documentation why not\n\n(27:30) because it has all been destroyed so we only have information from those secondhand apparently history tells us today that these three powers that were removed were Aryan in their view in other words that they taught that Jesus was not God and therefore had to be removed but there is really no evidence\n\n(27:57) for that whatsoever other than secondhand information by the very power that destroyed them so they were destroyed 493 ad now if this creature does fourth one the new power arose amongst them then you must have arisen already before 493 the next ones to go with the Vandals ad 534 they plagued the Roman Empire and they subjected large\n\n(28:31) parts of the religious culture of culture of the Byzantine and Roman world they subjected it ferociously and so eventually the Vandals were also destroyed by the armies of the Eastern Empire and then came the Ostrogoths they were the last one the Ostrogoths ruled until 538 ad and they occupied first\n\n(28:59) this area and later occupied and controlled the whole of the ancient Roman capital and surrounding area and so in 538 ad the opposition to the little horn power disappeared and it rose like a mushroom so the Alemanni the remnant of the 10 or the Germans today the big onions to Swift's the Franks the\n\n(29:28) French the Lombards the Italians the Saxons the English the swavey the Portuguese the Visigoths of Spanish and the rouille the Vandals and the Ostrogoths are eliminated totally destroyed in fact these were the only not the only ones that the waged war against oh no no no the visi God for example probably being very much\n\n(29:51) related to the Ostrogoths had similar sentiments and there were many many wars fought a much subjugation over here before these came in line with the sinking of the little horn power as well the greatest ally of the little horn power was the Franks who are today the French and the first one to adopt this\n\n(30:16) robe upon himself was Clovis and Clovis will go down in history as the man who more than any other helped the little horn power to come to fruition Daniel 7 verse 9 I beheld till the thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did since whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure\n\n(30:42) wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire so Daniel is watching the events down here on earth which all seem to revolve around this little horn power and he sees a great judgment theme taking place in heaven verse 10 says the judgment was fest and the books were opened so here\n\n(31:07) is a judgment scene and I saw in the night visions and behold one like the Son of Man come with the clouds of heaven that's an acronym for angels will see that in a nut in a later lecture and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him verse 13 so this is not the coming of Christ to this\n\n(31:32) earth this is a scene that takes place in heaven as the little horn power sets up his domain here on this earth so the judgment is ready to sit in the heavenly realm now let's have a look at Paul's reference to the man of sin in second Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 1 to 10 Paul describes win this power the santee\n\n(32:01) power will arrive now we've receipts you brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you not be soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand you see some we're teaching even in Paul's days\n\n(32:23) that the day of the Lord is at hand and some were preaching that Christ was already ruling and Paul says no no no no no there's first some things that must happen so the day of Christ is not there yet let no man deceive you by any means for that day the coming of the Lord shall not come except there come a\n\n(32:49) falling away first so first the church goes into apostasy and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition only two folks in the Bible are called son of perdition only to the one is the man of sin and the other one was Judith now how did Judas betray Jesus with a kiss he betrayed him with the kiss you see\n\n(33:31) Judith pretended to still be one of them and he betrayed Jesus the other one do you think he might also pretend to be one of them and betray Jesus with a kiss do you think it's possible on a greater scale so let no man deceive you by any man's for that day the coming of the Lord will not come except there come a\n\n(34:00) falling away first apostasy in the church and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or batteries worship so that he as God should have been the temple of God showing himself that He is God so here is a power that assumes tremendous\n\n(34:24) presumptuous power unto itself in fact this power is going to say I am another god on the surface and salvation is through me but this power is going to be a subtle power that works just like to this work just like Judas worked and this is the spirit of Antichrist where of you have heard that it should come\n\n(34:53) and even now already is in the world one john 4 verse 3 so now let's think about this if the spirit of Antichrist was already in the world in the time of John if Paul says they will come a falling away and in this man of sin will be revealed then this man of sin has been with us all along so now we've already\n\n(35:20) seen that he cannot have come out of a Greek Empire because he comes out of the fourth Empire and he also cannot come in the future sometime from a tribe in Palestine is that correct would you all agree with me alrighty that is correct then the whole of Christianity must be lying wrong on this issue because half\n\n(35:51) of Christianity teaches that the Antichrist came in the past his name was Antiochus IV finest for and he was a great king and the Bible says he come out of the fourth beast and in fact after the decline of the fourth beast in the division entertaining the other half of Christianity is taught that the\n\n(36:11) Antichrist will come into the future after the rapture and there's a problem because then the Christian Church is not even part of us but here it was already in the world acting already in a cleanser I'm Anna in the early Christian church so neither of those two can be right Paul continues remember ye not that when\n\n(36:38) I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so something is holding back this power from arising and something is withholding it for the mystery of iniquity doth already work so this power the scene liquidus mystery power is already working in the world in Paul's\n\n(37:06) time so no future power that will only come at the end of time no no no it's been here all of us only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way or less reserved BBE version there is one who is keeping back the evil till he's taken out of the way so there was some power holding back so\n\n(37:30) this little horn power could not arise and Paul had told them what it was remember I told you these things but he doesn't say it here and then shall the wicked be revealed in the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so this power will be revealed\n\n(37:52) when something holding it back is taken away or some power holding it back and then this power will be destroyed at the second coming of Christ even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders there's an interesting story and with all the suitableness of\n\n(38:14) unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved so possible that the system will receive the world into accepting a form of the gospel which is based on human values and not on divine values and on human criteria and not on divine criteria is\n\n(38:33) that possible here we have a point on which Paul we read and romanism and the Reformation by grotty on Paul affirms the existence of knowledge in the Christian Church so the early church knew he says what the hindrance was the early church tells us what it did no upon the subject and no one in these days can be in a position to\n\n(38:57) contradict its testimony as to what Paul at by word of mouth only told the Thessalonians it is a point on which ancient tradition alone can have authority modern speculation is positively impertinent on such a subject today people are saying well what could have been holding it back maybe the Holy Spirit holding it back why should the\n\n(39:19) Holy Spirit be holding it back there was a power holding it back and when that is removed the Antichrist will arise and he will remain until the Lord come so what is the early church fathers know what it Paul told them verbally what he told them but what did he not write down well let's go to the early church fathers\n\n(39:41) tertullian on the resurrections Christian apologists of 280 he says he you now hinders must hinder until he's taken out of the way what obstacle is there but the Roman State the falling away of which by being scattered into ten kingdoms shall introduce Antichrist so that's what the early church fathers\n\n(40:02) believed that when the Roman state goes Antichrist will be revealed is that biblical according to Daniel chapter 7 absolutely when Rome divides into ten when Roman State disappears Antichrist will be revealed that's what the early church fathers believed here's another one John crisis from homily 22 selonians\n\n(40:27) to he was Bishop of constantinople 390 he says only there is one that restrain us now until he be taken out of the way that is when the Roman Empire taken out of the way then he Antichrist shall come believe the same thing here's another one Edward Elliott who writes commentary on the apocalypse 1962 he says we have\n\n(40:47) the consenting testimony of the early fathers from Irenaeus the disciple of son John down to Christ the storm and prone to the effect that it was understood to be the imperial power ruling and residing at Rome so it's actually quite simple when wrongful the Antichrist will come while the fees is how Imperial palate was impossible for\n\n(41:12) the predicted Antichrist to arrive on the fall of the Caesars he would arise there is another source Paul did not identify the restraining power which they knew to be wrong for fear of reprisals remember the Christian Church was under persecution by Rome another quote so Paul didn't say when Ron Falls\n\n(41:33) he'll come because if he said publicly and written when Ron Falls he will come it would have been in big trouble and so with the persecuted Church so the early church believed they when Ron Falls Antichrist will arrive Daniel 7 says he will arise when Rome is divided into 10 then he will arise so that the biblical\n\n(41:58) criteria of winged Antichrist starts ruling we're going to talk now about this little horn power let's have a look at the attributes given by Daniel of the little horn power number one he arises out of the fourth beast Daniel 7 verse 7 and 8 is everybody happy with that so he comes out of wrong that's where he rises\n\n(42:25) it's a Roman power number two arrivals amongst the ten ons I consider the halls with boughs they came up amongst them another little horn so he has to arise in the Western Roman Empire it is a European power it's not any other power on this earth he arises after the ten horns so he assumes his position of\n\n(42:51) power sometime after 476 ad and another seller eyes are two then verse 24 he is different from the other horns he shall be verse from the first verse 24 that's the first criterion is another criterion he becomes more stuff than the others most outs and his fellows verse 20 here's a power that becomes mightier than any of\n\n(43:27) the other kingdoms you know what shouldn't be too difficult to see what the Bible is saying uncomfortable yes but not too difficult yeah brute three kingdoms before whom three fell versus 20 he has eyes like a man and spoke great words against the most high verses 8 and verse 25 so he lifts himself up\n\n(43:59) into the position where God should be number one he replaces divine precepts with human presets and he maps out the path to heaven through the power of man and not the power of God serious serious issue and he speaks great things against the most high will have to look at that and then you'll make war against the\n\n(44:25) Saints he'll wear out the Saints verse 25 so this power must have been a persecuting power that fought against those who said salvation is through the power of God alone and then another criterium he'll change times and laws those 25 says he'll think to change times and laws that's fascinating now which times in which laws do you think\n\n(44:55) God would be concerned about would God be concerned about silly little human laws no it must be modification of divine law and the times must be changing the times which God had fit for example God set the time and it shall be evening in it shall be morning the fur stay and it shall be evening and it\n\n(45:23) shall be morning the second day from evening to evening when the day that's the first time then there were feasts and festivals and times that were six with this power change all of that fascinating that's the ninth criterium given in the book of Daniel Daniel is very precise and he will rule they shall\n\n(45:50) be given into his hand unto a time times and the dividing of time time times and half a time prophetic yrs three and a half we'll deal with that fascinating verse 25 and shall devour the whole earth the fourth beast which shall be different shall devour the whole earth the different component of it shall\n\n(46:16) devour the whole earth and shall trample it can crush it doesn't include the United States of America listen do you think you're being controlled by someone else do you think you might be being right now being controlled by someone else the mighty USA do you think so what about the mighty Russia what about any\n\n(46:38) mighty nation what about China you think they might be controlled right now by someone else and it exists till the end until the Ancient of Days came verse 22 now I'm not making this up this is in the Book of Daniel you can get the Book of Daniel yourself and you can read it and the final criterium his Dominion\n\n(46:58) will be taken away at the end of time but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end the Bible says he shall be destroyed by the brightness of the Lord's coming so no earthly power is going to take his power away God Himself is going to intervene\n\n(47:21) 13 criteria there is only one power in the whole wide world historically and otherwise that can qualify which is a rather sad criteria now I don't want to upset anyone here this evening and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings but the fact of the matter is that this power is so clearly identified that I myself who\n\n(47:53) was part of that power had to resign from that power and leave it I was affected myself I was very shocked when I found this up and it actually physically made me sick when I discovered this so who is he he arises out of the force beast he arises among the ten horns after the penalties different from the others when the last\n\n(48:18) wave of barbarian invasions have spent its force the face of Europe has been transformed independent Germanic kingdoms had been established on the ruins of the Roman Empire that's church history page 175 out of the ruins of the roman empire that gladly arose a new order of states whose central point was\n\n(48:38) the type of fee therefore inevitably resulted a position not only knew but very different from the former the church and churches page 42 and 43 this is a Roman Catholic soul saying that here was a different situation to what there was before there are two theories on the Antichrist in the world today\n\n(49:05) that are being taught by every single Church in the world almost the one is Rivera Rivera and the other one is al Qaeda's policy now what did they teach they taught puri tourism and futurism pre tourism teaches that the Antichrist came in the past and the time of the Greeks futurism teachers that he will\n\n(49:38) come in the future after the Christian Church has been taken away and both of these doctrines are not biblical because both of them violates Daniel chapter 7 daniel chapter 8 the whole book of Revelation they violate every single biblical principle all of them and who were Rivera and who was al casa well the two of them were Jesuits\n\n(50:05) so these are doctrines head into the world after the Reformation wise the Roman Church itself to take away the emphasis from the papacy and put them in two different directions historian CC occurred when the Roman Empire had disintegrated and its place had been taken by a number of rude barbarous kingdoms the Roman Catholic Church not\n\n(50:29) only became independent of the state in religious affairs but dominated secular affairs as well the papacy in world affairs page 1 so here was a horn a kingdom that became more stout than the other it dominated them it qualified historian Thomas Hobbes says if a man considered the origin of the great\n\n(50:51) ecclesiastical Dominion he will easily perceive that the papacy is none other than the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire sitting crowned upon the grave they're all okay so Rome is not really gone it's called the Roman Catholic Church isn't it so Rome is not really gone at all levy at on page 4 57 he\n\n(51:20) shall be different from the first we saw that Rome says yes we're different because now it is a religious power that wields political clouds more stuff than his fellows Daniel 720 he would be mightier than the other kings did the kings of Europe bow down to the papacy yes sometimes yes sometimes no if no\n\n(51:44) eventually they were subjugated and did bow down eventually they did have to come like Frederick of Germany and stand barefoot in the snow waiting for a reprieve to get his kingdom back the most holy councils volume 13 Rome says we define that the holy apostolic sea and the Roman pontiff holds the primacy of how much of the world the\n\n(52:11) whole world that's interesting The Vicar of the Inca night son of God anointed high priest from supreme temporal ruler the Pope set in his tribunal in partially to judge between nation and nation people and Prince sovereign and subject Henry connell many temporal power of the vicar of Jesus Christ so\n\n(52:30) did they say that they were in control of all the other kingdoms yes or no yes they claim so themselves keys of this blood Pope John Paul 2 vs russia on the list for control of the New World Order Malachi Martin Pontifical professor at the Gregorian University in Rome itself he's saying it not me uprooted three\n\n(52:55) kingdoms then I would know the truths of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others and of the ten homes that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whole three fell Daniel 7 19 and 20 yes run claims as the three were uprooted because they were Arian they didn't believe that Christ\n\n(53:15) was God which is one of the teachings of Rome but we will see that there is just an exoteric teaching of Rome there is another teaching of Rome which is called esoteric which is a hidden teaching which says something completely different but that'll take another lecture it has eyes like a man and it\n\n(53:36) spoke great words against the most high here's a system that sets itself up above God and will speak against the most high and still wear out the Saints there was given him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies says verse 5 blessed for me so what is black for me and was given unto him to make war with\n\n(54:02) the Saints and to overcome them did the Roman Church do this absolutely Daniel 7 25 he shall speak great words against the Most High shall wear out the Saints of the Most High to change times and laws of course you can't change God's laws it's just the power that thinks it can and they shall be given into his hand until the time\n\n(54:23) times and the dividing of time we'll have to look at those tix in detail let's first look at the biblical definition of blasphemy and see where the wrong qualifier well we find it in John chapter 10 verse 30 and 33 I and the father are one says Jesus Jesus says he's got the Jews answered him saying we\n\n(54:49) do not stone you for a good work but for blasphemy and because you being a man make yourself God so the one definition in the Bible of blasphemy is if someone says that he's God well many blasphemy and FEMA's in the world today but that's the one definition the other definition we find in Luke where it says and seeing\n\n(55:13) their face he said to the man your sins are forgiven you and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who's this who speaks blasphemy who can forgive sins except God alone so there are two biblical definitions of blaspheming the one is if you say that you are God and the other one is if you\n\n(55:34) say that you can forgive sin well what is the wrong say is the Catholic Encyclopedia volume 12 article on the Pope it says this judicial authority will even include the power to pardon sir so Rome says it can forgive sins the Catholic priests page 78 says seek where your world to heaven and us and you will\n\n(55:59) find one created being who can forgive the sinner who can free him from the chains of hell that extraordinary being is the priest the Roman Catholic priests interesting there are the priests flavor says the ordaining bishop is no longer a man a simple child of atoms but an altar crystals another Christ that's\n\n(56:17) interesting another Christ in the place of Jesus Christ in the place of in greek is auntie krystal Antichrist in the place off forever a priest of the Most High with power over the almighty now that's heavy to say that you have more power than God the Pope is not only the representative of Jesus Christ but he is Jesus Christ\n\n(56:45) himself hidden under the veil of flesh the Catholic National July 1895 so Rome has always claimed that she is in the position of God God Himself is obliged to abide by the judgment of his priests and either not to pardon or to pardon according as they the priest refused or give absolution the sentence of the\n\n(57:11) priest precedes and God subscribes to it dignities and duties of the priest vol 12 page 27 Wow so the Catholic Church says who is saved and who is lost and God haven't got a hope he has to abide by their judgment and if they say no God concierge so whose mighty Jose Oh God they are is this less for me yes or no\n\n(57:37) this is blasphemy of the highest order Cardinal Bellarmine says all names which in Scripture applied to Christ by virtue of which it is established that he's over the church all the same names are applied to the Pope that means he assumes the place of God so he qualifies on that count given in Rome from our\n\n(57:58) palace the tenth of every eighteen seventeen there's a 15th jurisdiction of the most holy pontiff and father in Christ and our Lord our God the Pope Leo the 12th so the Pope had himself crowned is God we hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty the great ecclesiastical letters of Pope Leo did you know that\n\n(58:22) when the papacy today writes an encyclical it always finds the encyclical up John Paul to in other words does this given by a capital letter in our cap to letter pontificate interesting because God says let us make man in our image capitals so the papacy takes the prerogative and to this day by their\n\n(58:58) writing they claim to have and be the power of God so Rome qualified the Most High Council we define that the holy apostolic see and the Roman pontiff held the primacy over the whole world now this power would eventually take control of the whole world just roam really control the world that's ludicrous do\n\n(59:24) you really believe that thing is possible are we going to have a lecture tomorrow on secret society I wouldn't miss it if I were you Thomas Aquinas wrote secular power this is the great Catholic philosopher that is quoted by John Paul two more than any other philosopher of the Roman Catholic churches he writes secular power is\n\n(59:51) subject to the spiritual power as the body is subject to the salt and therefore it is not a usurpation of authority if the spiritual prelate interfere in temporal things concerning those matters in which the secular power is subject to him so everybody is subject to roam the Council of Trent declared all temporal power is his the\n\n(1:00:14) Dominion the jurisdiction and the government of the whole earth is he's by divine right all rulers of the earth or his subjects and must submit to him there was a Council of Trent that's the one that ended the attack of the Reformation here we have a lady who said jesus said I am the good shepherd and\n\n(1:00:46) this lady said it's like being with God when she saw John Paul to did you wear out the same it was given him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them well again Thomas Aquinas said that convicted heretics should be put to death just as surely as other criminal the Catholic Church is a respecter of conscience and of Liberty\n\n(1:01:12) nevertheless when confronted with heresy she has resourced to sports to corporal punishment to torture she'll it in Italy the funeral powers of the Inquisition Catholic professor Alfred forget the Catholic Church Renaissance Protestantism yes she admits it here is the Piazza del gesÃ¹ which is the seat of\n\n(1:01:36) the Jesuits here is the Jesuit oath that is made which basically says that they can get rid of any heretical King in the entire world any Commonwealth of governments that does not want to subject itself to the papacy and anybody who does not submit to the authority of the Roman pontiff can be safely\n\n(1:02:00) destroyed so the church ruled as the woman ruling over kings that is how she depicted herself throughout history the Inquisition well the Inquisition tells us that she wore out the Saints the Tower of London The Hague in the Netherlands what is the definition of heresy Greek erases choice deciding for\n\n(1:02:25) oneself what song shall believe and practice that's heresy so who must decide for you run must decide for you what you must believe and if you do not fall in line with this well then you must be eliminated you must be eradicated those are representations of the pious the specs of the Inquisition and they killed literally millions and\n\n(1:02:53) millions of people is the famous hyuga no monument in Africa where the French Huguenot escaped and after the great massacre whether you can knows when Massa asalamu massacre and they depicted themselves as a woman the church escaping with a Bible in her hand and the chains of Rome torn loose well I have news for you this woman is once\n\n(1:03:19) again chained and every other woman on the planet talking of churches is once again chained changes times and laws sync to change times and laws Daniel 725 does the Pope claim that he changed God's law absolutely dick little the translator be scoped the Pope has power to change times to abrogate laws and to\n\n(1:03:45) dispense with all things even the precepts of Christ that's arrogance of the highest order so they say that they can change these things little papacy changed the time certainly did what calendar are we keeping in the world today who knows we're keeping the gregorian calendar who was Gregory he was a pope and what the times changed\n\n(1:04:10) yes on the authority of whom of the Jesuit astronomers what did they change they changed Easter they brought the east of feasts to bring them in line with a feast of each stock they even called it that Easter Easter Easter feast and so whereas the posh was celebrated according to the new moon and the Passover could take place on any day\n\n(1:04:39) of the week depending on when the new moon was sighted so the papacy changed it and followed the symbolism of the Sadducees who were trained in Alexandria in occult teaching and moved it in line with the feast of Ishtar and now Easter falls only on a Sunday and never coincides with the Passover it is\n\n(1:05:04) possible with the calendar was that they have is that at some stage in history it can actually coincide with the Passover and what does the type of season decree if there happens to be a lining up of the Passover with the feast of Ishtar then the papacy shifts Easter one week so that it'll still fall on the sunday\n\n(1:05:26) so she changed the times and the feast definitely also since these times we are celebrating the day from midnight to midnight and not from sunset to sunset and then did she abrogate the laws and dispense for the things and the precepts of Christ the Pope can modify divine law prompter biblioteca who gives you the\n\n(1:05:50) right to mr. Pope to change the law of God the Ten Commandments as originally given by God on the first tablet you shall have no other gods before me then there is this big commandment that you shall not bow down to idols and then you may not take the name of the Lord your vein the Sabbath commandment that is\n\n(1:06:12) very prominent and then you have the commandments dictating the relationship between man and man honor your father and your mother shalt not kill adultery theft thou shalt not bring false witness and covetousness those are the commandments as they are in the Bible to take their Catholic catechism you'll see\n\n(1:06:35) that the second commandment has been removed you shall not have other gods so not he shall be able to change laws of course he says so I am The Lord of God you shall have no strange gods before me thou shalt not take the man the LORD thy God in vain so the second commandment is gone this one has moved one up remember\n\n(1:06:57) to keep holy the Sabbath day but what have they done to that we'll see about that in a moment and so they only have nine Commandments and to get 10 they take the commandment on coveting and split into two thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife and thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's good very fascinating\n\n(1:07:16) remember that this one over here says thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife so they turn it round isn't that fascinating they even have the gall to turn around as if they had the right to do that the Catholic Encyclopedia says the Church of the changing the day of rest\n\n(1:07:37) from the Jewish Sabbath or the seventh day of the week to the first made the third commandment referred to Sunday because the second one was gone now as a day to be kept holy as the Lord's Day Catholic Encyclopedia so they changed the time even the day of worship which was the seventh day was shifted to the\n\n(1:07:57) first day of the week Matthew 5 17 says think not that I came to destroy the law the prophets I came not to destroy but to fulfill to live them out here's the converse Catechism of the Catholic doctrine page 50 and it says question which is the Sabbath day answers Saturday's the Saturday Catholic Church\n\n(1:08:21) is well aware of it they know it question why do we observe sunday instead of saturday answer we observed sunday instead of saturday because the catholic church in the council of loaded sphere transferred the solemnity from the saturday to the sunday so did she change times and laws yes or no yes she\n\n(1:08:43) did x times and half a time what does that refer to the Saints will be handed over to him for a time times and half a time she have a modern Bible it'll say three and a half years now prophetic yrs are different to normal Europe a year in the prophetic sense at 360 days because the Hebrew you had 360 days so 360 2 x\n\n(1:09:13) 720 half a time hacia 180 add them all up that would give you 1260 prophetic days now that becomes 1260 literal years let's just sort this out with the conquest of rome by Belisarius commences the history of the middle ages so in rome was concord and the ostrogoths were removed the history of the Middle Ages started\n\n(1:09:48) Philip shape says Viggle asst ascended the papal chair 538 ad under the military protection of Belisarius so when did the little horn power assume its authority the answer is 538 ad because the last of the little horns of the horn powers that kept him back with the Ostrogoths they were removed in 538\n\n(1:10:16) ad and vigorous ascends the papal chair so the dominance of Rome begin another shall arise after them the ten kingdoms established ad 476 after them ad 538 paper rule commences according to a decree which was issued by Justinian and probe Rome who said that the Pope will be the corrector of heretics and the\n\n(1:10:46) ruler of all the churches now 538 if you add 1260 you come to 1,000 798 1798 what happened in 1798 Berthier entered Rome on the tenth of februari 1798 and proclaimed a republic half of Europe thought napoleon's vita would be obeyed and that with the Pope's the papacy was dead so exactly according to prophetic\n\n(1:11:19) time and the Bible tells us to take a day for a year exactly according to that time when the clock struck 1798 the temporal power of the papacy was halted for a while so 1260 years time prophecy 476 ad the ten kingdoms are established 538 ad the bishop officially recognized as the ruler of all the churches 1260\n\n(1:11:53) years of time prophecy brings 217 98 44 his domain and Dominion ended 1260 years it was based on 1260 days which is the same as three and a half prophetic years but it's also the same as 42 months 42 x 30 that was the biblical month 42 times 30 is also 1260 now in Revelation 12 verse 6 we read a thousand two hundred and threescore days\n\n(1:12:31) that's 1260 days in Revelation 12 14 at time times and half the time see how a revelation picks up the theme of this power and brings it into the heart of Revelation here they all are Daniel 7 25 x times in the dividing of time referring to this power Daniel 12 7 times x and a half revelation 11 to 42\n\n(1:12:57) months revelation 11 3 12 hundred and sixty days revelation 12 6 12 hundred and sixty days revelation 12 14 time times and half a time revelation 13 five forty and two months all of these referring to the same power notice how many they are one two three four five six seven the Bible is fantastic What's\n\n(1:13:22) it telling us there's this power would set itself up as another God because seven is the number of God and it would assume all these characteristics and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed Rome receives the word in the form of the little horn power and it's going to\n\n(1:13:50) be healed and all the world wondered after the peace revelation 13 3 so the same power that ruled over the Saints for 1260 days receives the mortal wound 1798 will rise again and the whole world will be subject to it that's what the Bible says and power was given him over all Kindred's and tongues and Nations\n\n(1:14:17) does that include the United States does that include my country yes it does Ronald Reagan and the papacy made a holy alliance that's a fascinating story will have to go into that into a little bit more detail and so even the mighty United States subjected itself to this power here we have a single picture\n\n(1:14:41) between garbage off from the papacy this is the mighty Soviet Union at that stage greeting and acknowledging this power it is a big idea a new world order where diverse nations are drawn together in a common cause only the United States suppose the model standing and the means to back it up at the Second Vatican\n\n(1:15:02) Council this was in 1962 document it states it is our duty therefore to strain every muscle in working for the time when all war will be completely outlawed by international consent this is the second vatican council this goal undoubtedly requires the establishment of the universal public authority acknowledged as such by all and endowed\n\n(1:15:30) with the power to safeguard on behalf of all security regard for justice and respect for right now Paul the sixth wrote in a section entitled towards effective world authority eros this international collaboration on a worldwide scale requires institutions that will prepare coordinate direct it until finally they is established an\n\n(1:15:58) order of Justice which is universally recognized who does not see the necessity of thus establishing progressively a world authority capable of acting effectively in judicial and political sectors fascinating stuff and who was crowned ruler of the whole world this man is a fascinating John Paul superstar maastricht the united Europe\n\n(1:16:33) what is the world to say about this why has the Parliament of Europe got this construction the very interesting construction will give our lecture on this interesting situation in Europe and what it means what did the George W Bush say about this power March 22 he said the best way to honor Pope John Paul to\n\n(1:16:59) truly one of the great men is to take his teachings seriously is to listen to his words and put his words and teachings into action here in America this is a challenge we must exit so who is subject to who here who is subject to in 1991 the pub called for a new world order well what was his New Year's\n\n(1:17:29) speech about this year he had only one message and he said it's time to establish the world authority right now that was his request he visited the united nations he spoke on behalf of all the religions in the entire world nothing note that that includes Buddhism and Hinduism and Shintoism and zoro asterism and Protestantism and\n\n(1:17:57) Catholicism and the whole shooting match his own agenda and Gorbachev said we must help John Paul too because he is right in his request for a new world order said Gorbachev when the Pope spoke at the United Nations at its 50th celebration all right do you think it is possible that Rome could be this power that the Vatican\n\n(1:18:36) could be this power but surely the Vatican looks like a noble Christian power trying to sit the right values into the world doesn't it look like this remember the Bible says man of perdition Judith looked like one of them but he betrayed Jesus with a kiss here is a power that looks like one of them but\n\n(1:19:06) could just betray it with a kiss we have to go into the secrets of the secret societies to find out what this is all about what is the reformist teach on this power many of the great Christians of the Reformation and post-reformation times shared this view of prophetic truth and identified Antichrist to the\n\n(1:19:26) Roman papacy among the adherence of this interpretation were the vol densest the who cites Wycliffe Luther Calvin swing Lima lankton the Baptist theologian John Gill de Matos Cranmer kindle Latimer Ridley all of them said wrong was the Antichrist you see what is Martin Luther said Luther said I know that the Pope is\n\n(1:19:46) Antichrist and that he seat is that upsetting himself the papacy is a general chased by command of the Roman pontiff for the purpose of running down and destroying sold that's pretty straight talk he didn't mince words and those days well John Calvin said he said we recall recall the Roman pontiff Antichrist interesting what did john\n\n(1:20:06) wesley say he said he's in the emphatic sense the man of sin as the increases all manner of sin above measure that's what the reformer said well John Knox say he said is that the Pope should be recognized as a very Antichrist well the Reformers didn't want anyone to forget so in Newton back which was the seat of\n\n(1:20:30) Protestantism on the Town Hall they had this sculpture presented over the two dolls and if you look over here you'll find something interesting you'll find the prophecy we dealt with tonight on the 15 you have a lion with eagle's wings and they have a ruler next to him and they tell us who he is it is Nebuchadnezzar\n\n(1:20:58) so who did the reformers say the Lions with Eagle wing stood for Babylon figure to the other side you have a bear with three ribs in his mouth and they put a king next to him a mighty king to tell us who they believed it represented and who was it this is cyrus the great so here by they are saying it was the Medes\n\n(1:21:24) and the Persians the reformers didn't mince words they put it in stone you don't see it today did you go to the other side you will see the other door that's what it looks like it's got a little bit closer there is a leopard beast with four heads and who do they put next to it to say who they believed\n\n(1:21:44) it was and salads onda the great so they identified it with grief and on the other side is a terrible beast with ten horns and they have a mighty Emperor there and who is he is Julius Caesar so who did they say it was they say it was run and then over here they have this strange little structure coming up\n\n(1:22:10) amongst them and it has the face of a man and it has the strange little crowd they made no bones as to who it was they said it was wrong who teaches that today's for nobody nobody teaches it anymore to the Christian churches teacher no they don't in fact I have all joined the ecumenical movement which\n\n(1:22:36) says let's again except Rome as our spiritual leader all the Christian denominations are part of their kamina chol movement and all of them are saying put the table back on rather sad let not anyone deceive you by any means for that day shall not come unless the first comes a falling away and the Mount\n\n(1:23:03) of Finn shall be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that he's worshipped so that he said says God in the temple of God setting himself for that He is God does this make sense now it certainly does if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect the\n\n(1:23:25) garb of Christianity is so perfect that we do not see the core of occultism behind it who really runs the show there who is behind it what power is yielded in Rome who is the black Pope who is Peter Hunt closing bar at the moment who is that what is his role in the world would you like to know so we see he\n\n(1:23:53) shall devour the whole earth that means this web of intrigue must spread across the whole world and he will continue to the end he's here right now but his Dominion will be taken away at the end of time now I am NOT saying that any Roman Catholic who is not aware of any of this which is in the Bible is\n\n(1:24:17) Antichrist I'm talking about a system here this is a system there are many many fine Roman Catholics in the Roman Catholic Church who worship God according to the best knowledge and according to the conscience that they had and God takes the knowledge that they have and judges according to the knowledge that they have and talking\n\n(1:24:41) about a system that has deceived even its own members and that sets itself up above God the Bible says the judgment shall certainly shall take away his rulership to cut often to destroy until the end and the kingdom and the rulership will belong to who will belong to God's people for the Son of Man is\n\n(1:25:04) going to come in his father's glory with his angels and venule reward each person according to what he has done and the greatness of the kingdom's under all the heaven says Daniel shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High whose kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom and all kingdoms shall serve and obey\n\n(1:25:23) here God is going to make an end of all things very soon and to find out what they intrigue behind the intrigues are invited to come to the next lectures even if you were upset tonight a very important that you come to the next lectures because this whole plan will be unfolded as we go into the book of\n\n(1:25:47) Revelation may the Lord be with you and help you and

It emphasizes the restorative nature of Revelation, showing how it reverses the consequences of mankind's fall, such as the loss of the Tree of Life and the robe of righteousness, by offering restoration through Jesus Christ. The speaker highlights the symbolic language of Revelation, which draws heavily from the Old Testament, particularly Daniel, and reveals a chiastic literary structure that provides a historical timeline of events, from the \"holy place\" ministry of Christ to the final judgment. Ultimately, the sermon argues that Revelation reveals Jesus as the exclusive path to salvation, highlighting His divinity and contrasting His unique claims with the commonality of other world religions.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 206 - The Revelation of Jesus Christ _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkQj3YtMgfs\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] good evening everyone good evening well tonight we're going to start a series that is going to be hair raising because the Book of Revelation is the story about the final conflict between the forces of good and the forces of evil it also has the history of the conflict from the birth of Christianity\n\n(01:29) to the end of of time it really is an incredible book and of course the ultimate author of this book is none other than Jesus Christ himself and the revelation of Jesus Christ is the most amazing book in the Bible it ends the biblical story in the beginning we have the Book of Genesis in Genesis we have\n\n(01:53) the Lost Tree of Life mankind fell into sin and lost access to the Tree of Life the consequences were death Genesis 2:1 17 and from that moment on man had to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow Genesis 3: 19 man lost his Dominion because he was created to have dominion and he became naked he lost the\n\n(02:23) robe of righteousness which covered him and then he was driven from God because sin and a holy God are incompatible that's the story of Genesis it's the sad story of the creation of man and the fall of Man the greatest gift to mankind that God could have given is the gift of freedom of choice without freedom of\n\n(02:50) choice we are robots and so God created man in the image of God with the capacity to to choose and love demands this gift of freedom of choice I always use an example what good is it if your wife or your husband loves you because he's pre-programmed to do so that might be fun for a week a year maybe even five\n\n(03:20) years but then eventually you'll get kind of sick of it right if they programed to love you and every morning they get up and they say I love you because they're programmed to do so but what happens if they have freedom of choice and in spite of your faults in spite of all the things that you do that are\n\n(03:43) obviously uh an irritation to everyone around you what if they still say I love you because they choose to doesn't that make it meaningful without Freedom of Choice life is meaningless so God created man in His image with the capacity to choose that's special and so man chose and unfortunately he chose the\n\n(04:10) wrong way Revelation is the book of Grace in Revelation 2:7 we read about the restoration of the tree of life we read about victory over death in Revelation 2: 11 we read about hidden Mana this is uh the bread that came from Heaven that was placed in the Ark of the Covenant and represented this heavenly bread\n\n(04:40) which would take away your hunger forever and that was replaced and we read about it in Revelation 2:1 17 Dominion would be restored Revelation 2: 26 those that accepted this wonderful gift from from God would be clothed in white so the Lost robe of righteousness would be restored Revelation 3:5 and no more separation from God\n\n(05:09) Revelation 3:12 so the Book of Revelation is a book of restoration but it also has information in it which is scary to put it bluntly scary the stru of the book there are seven churches seven letters seven stars seven candlesticks seven spirits seven lamps Seven Seals seven trumpets seven horns seven eyes seven Thunders seven\n\n(05:41) heads seven crowns seven angels seven vials and seven mountains so the number seven is obviously important the number seven is the the number of the Divine it's the number of perfection it is the message of God built in but there is a counterfeit as well and we will be dealing with that as we go along and obviously if we look at all\n\n(06:06) these components then there is a symbolic meaning in all of these as well so the Book of Revelation uses symbolic language and where does it get the symbolic language from it draws it from the Old Testament so without the Old Testament we would not be able to understand the Book of Revelation many of the symbols in the Book of Revelation\n\n(06:32) come for example from Zachariah from Ezekiel from all the prophets of the Old Testament particularly also Daniel and many of the symbols that we find in the Book of Revelation you will find in the Book of Daniel you will find the terrible beasts in the Book of Revelation and the description of the beasts like lions like leopards like\n\n(06:56) bears and terrible beasts with 10 horns you will find those in the Book of Daniel and you will find the number seven in the Book of Daniel if you go through Daniel chapter 7 for example you will have Beasts there and if you count up the heads of the beasts that are mentioned in Daniel chapter 7 you'll\n\n(07:17) find seven heads and so you will find seven heads in the Book of Revelation so the picture is drawn from there and it is the key to the Book of Revelation now unfortunately we're not going to go through the Book of Daniel in order to unlock some of these things so we're just going to say it straight up but\n\n(07:38) there are other videos which have already been made which have all the details as to how these symbolic figures in the Book of Daniel can be applied to the Book of Revelation so we'll be dealing with the churches the letters the Stars the candlesticks tonight we'll be dealing with the seven churches for\n\n(07:58) example and many of these components will start to become clear then there's something else about the Book of Revelation that's very fascinating there's a sanctuary language in the Book of Revelation now you know in the Old Testament the Hebrews had to build a sanctuary for God and it was very precisely laid out how the sanctuary had\n\n(08:21) to look what the components were there was a a wall around it an outer covering of linen representing ing righteousness there was one door into the sanctuary there was an altar in an outer Court where the offerings were made there was a labor where they washed themselves then there was a compartment which was\n\n(08:42) divided into two the first being called The Holy then the most holy and the high priest officiated in this sanctuary and this Sanctuary language tells us about the ministry of the high priest applied to the minist Ministry of the great high priest who would take the place of all those that had been typified in the Old\n\n(09:07) Testament so the sanctuary language is very important because it tells us where and at what stage of the ministry this story is unfolding so for example when you go Revelation chapters 1 to3 you have the story of the seven churches Jesus the light of the world there was only one entry way into the sanctuary\n\n(09:35) and it was called the gate and Jesus says I am the door he who enters in by me shall have eternal life there is only one door according to the Bible whereby we may be saved and that is through Christ Jesus that's what the Bible says today that is not not a popular teaching and it's going to get less and less\n\n(10:03) popular as we go along and we're going to look at some of these these teachings so for example the gate the doorway was very very important in Old Testament times it was the place where judgment took place the elders sat in the gate the gate was the doorway Behind the Walls whereby you could enter into\n\n(10:28) safety this a lot of symbolism in the gate and Jesus Christ says I am the door I am the gate now the old word that they used for gate was bab and there's a story in the Bible about Babel bob L gate to God so story of Babel tells us of another gate to God another entryway to God the bab Al Babel gate to God and this is a story of your\n\n(11:07) own Merit bringing you to God that is the counterfeit that we have in the Bible to the biblical story of Sav by the blood of the Lamb the only way to Salvation is through the Merit not of our works but through the Merit of Jesus Christ those are the two parameters that have been in opposition to each other\n\n(11:34) since the dawn of man since the fall of Man let's put it that way so here when we're dealing with lights the lights were in the first chamber so that means Ministry in the Holy uh when we come to Revelation 3-8 we're dealing with the seals and that is bread of the presence so we're still in that first chamber of\n\n(11:58) the sanctuary in the Holy place then come the trumpets Revelation 8-11 and there you can see a golden altar where you have incense rising from the golden altar so we're still in the Holy place these are are chambers or events taking place in a period where the high high priest representatively is still serving in\n\n(12:24) that particular chamber soon as you get to Revelations 12 to4 14 there's another picture there the prophet sees the Ark of God now the Ark of God was not in the first chamber of the of the sanctuary it was in the second chamber which was called the most holy the hagiya hagion in the most holy so we've moved to\n\n(12:49) another portion of the ministry of the high priest and he only entered into the place where the ark stood once a year and that was on the day of of atonement now these are are heavy subjects and we haven't got time to deal with all of them again there's a video available on this particular topic of what all these\n\n(13:09) things meant and if you study it in this way you get this picture of where you are in the Stream of time there are seven blessings in the Book of Revelation blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written there in for the time is at hand Revelation\n\n(13:32) 1:3 so obviously God wants us to read it to hear it and to take it to heart because how can you keep something that you don't understand right so when you're looking at this blessing isn't it pretty certain that God wants us to understand what the Book of Revelation is about absolutely so there's a blessing in it so how is it possible\n\n(13:58) that some say that it is a sealed book not to be understood well then you forgo this blessing some actually say it is a book that shouldn't be read because it's for the Damned well if it is for the Damned then how can there be a blessing if you read it and take it to heart and I Heard a Voice from Heaven\n\n(14:19) saying unto me right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from hence forth yay says the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their Works do follow them Revelation 1413 here's also an illusion to The Works issue works is not a means to Salvation it's a consequence of salvation but there is a blessing to\n\n(14:44) those that die in Christ those who have accepted the lamb as their means to Salvation rather than AB bab L another port to God behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame so we have to cling to the righteousness of Christ we have no\n\n(15:11) righteousness Christ is our righteousness and uh if we give up that idea and if we give up the hope of his coming to save those that are his well then the chances are that we will walk naked Revelation 19:9 and he says unto me bless blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he says unto me these are true\n\n(15:38) sayings of God well obviously there's a blessing in it if you are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb that means that you form part of the Bride blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection see there are two resurrections mentioned in the Bible the first resurrection is the resurrection of those who die in Christ\n\n(16:04) and they take part in this wedding feast and then there is a second resurrection and they take past in another Feast which is called the supper of the birds and I don't think we want to take part in that one so those that take part in the have a part in the first resurrection they are the ones that shall be Priests of God and of Christ\n\n(16:28) and shall reign with him a thousand years here you have the millennial period the seven blessings behold I come quickly blessed you see that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book Revelation 22:7 I believe this means more than just the Book of Revelation the whole Bible the Bible is the standard for the setting of character it\n\n(16:52) is the story of Salvation and blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city so obedience to God is a very important factor as well Revelation 22:14 now obviously there's going to be a a counterargument to all of those\n\n(17:19) factors now the Book of Revelation is written in a particular structure we call such a structure a kaym it's a literary structure which is supposed to set the events in a particular way in time so for example if we take the Book of Revelation as a whole it is written in a in a sort of a pyramid shape and the first parts are\n\n(17:48) what we call the historic arm the seven churches the Seven Seals the seven trumpets and they lead up to the great controversy climax between Christ and Satan and the followers of Satan and the followers of Christ and the second arm reading from the back to the middle would be the New Jerusalem the Millennium and the fall of\n\n(18:14) Babylon so this structure tells us where we are in the Stream of time and if you understand the structure of the Book of Revelation then it's easier to get round because some people like to throw things all over the place for example there are many who take the trumpets and throw them into the future in other\n\n(18:37) words into the eschatology so they'll take the trumpets and apply them to events still to come in in the future when God restores all things but then of course you destroy the kaym you cannot destroy the kaym you can also see where each one of these fits in by looking at the sanct language so for example when\n\n(19:01) you're looking at the churches the seals and the trumpets the language that is used there still applies to the first chamber I'll be dealing with that as we go along it doesn't matter if we don't understand it all at this stage so it tells us historically where we are in the Stream of time so that we don't jump ahead of\n\n(19:22) ourselves we have to stick to the rules and this is a marvelous way of getting around in the book of Revelation there a problem though because once you've read through the first half of the book and you come to the middle which is basically Revelation chap 10 11 12 13 14 all the way up to 17 that's the sort of final block of the\n\n(19:49) final events of the battle between good and evil once you start reading past that you are actually reading events in reverse because the kism is structures like this and so it gets very confusing you have things in the wrong sequence and it doesn't make any sense and the Book of Revelation gets so complicated\n\n(20:12) that you cannot put them into any particular order whereas if you know that it is a kaym then you can read the words as they follow in English but the events you put in reverse and then the whole thing falls into place and it makes beautiful sense and the literary style has has a reason it prevents us\n\n(20:33) from becoming disjointed and jumping all over the place now let's just have a look how how you pick it up so that it's not just some conjecture that someone makes so for example if you take the seven churches you'll see that in Chapter 2 verse1 it says he that holdeth the Seven Stars walketh in the midst of the seven\n\n(20:56) candlesticks the golden candlesticks and when you look at the end of The Book of Revelation the New Jerusalem you'll find in chapter 21: 23 the lamb is the light thereof so there you have a light and you have the lamb being the light thereof chapter 2:7 to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the\n\n(21:17) Tree of Life chapter 22:2 we have the mention of the tree of life so there you have the chastic link there's an open door in Revelation 3:8 in Revelation 21:25 towards the end you have Gates that never close Christ in his father's Throne on his father's Throne Revelation 3:21 221 and3 the Throne of God and of\n\n(21:45) the Lamb the New Jerusalem is mentioned in chap 3:12 and the New Jerusalem comes down in chapter 21:10 in chapter 311 I am coming soon chapter 22:7 I'm coming soon you see how you pick up the kaym how they stick together so you know all right this is how we're working and this is how we move along now what's also interesting is\n\n(22:11) that anything that falls into the first part of the kaym must be before the close of probation because the high priest is ministering and that means salvation is open to all when you come to the eschatology probation is closed because the gates never close anymore they are constantly open the Throne of God has\n\n(22:39) become the Throne of God and of the Lamb that means Christ Reigns in his kingdom so you can pick up where you are in the Stream of time so you cannot make a mistake by putting things in the wrong place so it helps us to stay within the framework when you come to the Seven Seals and you pick up the uh the story\n\n(23:00) there again the Seven Seals are about Christ and his afflicted people and uh you have the resurrected people enthroned here they are afflicted there they are enthroned so obviously the Seven Seals falls into which portion probation closed or open probation must still be open because they are still being inflicted\n\n(23:25) they are here on Earth whereas in the second part they are enthroned their suffering is over they have been restored so here you have Heaven opened and chapter 1911 Heaven open chapter 6 the rider on a white horse chapter 19 a rider on a white horse chapter 6:9 The Souls of the martyrs ask for judgment\n\n(23:48) and in Chapter 20 The Souls of the martyrs are resurrected and enthroned as judges in chapter 6 and seven you hear about white robes in chapter 9 19 they are given white robes in chapter 6 15 and 16 hears about you hear about Kings generals Etc they ask to be killed and here they are killed again so you find\n\n(24:11) the structure coming together then the Book of Revelation contrasts Christ and his people with Satan and his followers so you have a trinity of God you have the father you have the son and you have the Holy Spirit and if you come to Satan's followers you have a false Trinity you have the dragon the Beast and the false prophet now the\n\n(24:39) dragon he represents God the Father the Beast you will see in the Book of Revelation he is the one that takes the place of Jesus Christ he's the one that sets up a kingdom but it is an Earthly Kingdom he's the one where everybody bows down to him every knee shall bow the Beast is the one that has a counterfeit death and a counterfeit\n\n(25:05) Resurrection he is the false Christ the anti Christos the Antichrist in the place of Jesus Christ because in 75% of cases the word Antichrist means in the place of we have to know what we're dealing with and the false prophet is then obviously the one who plays the role of the false Holy Spirit and these\n\n(25:32) three powers are going to deceive the whole world into following a wrong set of rules and following a wrong savior this is a dangerous story and it is so perfectly done and so deceptive that if we do not study it in detail we will not even know do you think that the world today might be largely deceived yes or\n\n(26:02) no absolutely that's what the Book of Revelation talks about what is it that Jesus said when the disciples approached him and asked him what is the sign of your coming and of the End of the Age what is the first thing that Jesus said he said be careful lest anyone deceive you deception is the name of the game in the\n\n(26:33) lectures that are coming now we will be dealing with deception like you have probably never heard it before and we're going to deal with some things which are hair raising hair raising so don't miss the lectures we're going to talk about things that are done in secret who does things in secret yes Jesus says I have done nothing in\n\n(27:03) secret but there are many things that are done in secret and this world make no mistake is being run by secret societies so we're going to have a look at secret societies because the Book of Revelation is about what happens in secret all power unto the sun power unto the Beast see the contrast Hebrews\n\n(27:24) Revelation 62 all power unto the Sun and the counterfeit system all power unto the Beast the keys of death and haters and the keys to the bottomless pit Revelation 91: 118 in uh Revelation so here you have the contrast between Christ and his followers and Satan and his followers and we will have to be\n\n(27:48) very meticulous to take these apart who is like unto the Lord Isaiah 418 who is like unto the Beast revelation 13: four so the beast power he's scary we have to watch him a lamb as it had been slain Revelation 138 one of the heads as it were wounded to death some translations say seemed to have a mortal wound he which is and\n\n(28:19) which was and which is to come Revelation 1 verse4 the Beast which was and is not and is about to come revelation 17:8 can you see the contrast so we're going to deal in terms of a battle and the one that is going to be the visible component of the battle is going to be the beast but he is hidden his name is\n\n(28:46) secret and so we have to look behind the scenes to find him because that which you see is not that which is that which you see is what you are supposed to see but that which you do not see is what you're not supposed to see and you're not supposed to know about it and that is very important that we find out what\n\n(29:09) happens behind the scenes then we read in Revelation 6:16 about the wroth of the lamb in Revelation 12:12 we read about the WTH of the devil in Revelation 72 and 3 God's seal is in the forehead of those that follow him but in Revelation 13 the beast's Mark is in the forehead or in the hand isn't that right so we have the\n\n(29:32) contrast we have the name of God in Revelation 14:1 and we have the name of the beast in Revelation 13:17 we have the tribes of Israel in Revelation 1:4 we have the tribes of the earth Revelation 17 we have the armies of Heaven Revelation 1914 we have the armies of Earth Revelation 1919 we have war against Satan and his people and we\n\n(29:55) have war against Christ and his followers revelation 12:7 Etc so there's a battle this is a war this is a story about a war we have a supper of the Lamb we have a supper of the birds we have the Lamb's bride we have the Harlot of Babylon we have the Apostles of the Lamb we have the false Apostles we have the\n\n(30:15) Jerusalem of God and we have Babylon Satan's church and we have the ruler of Heaven Earth and sea and we have the Beast out of the sea the Beast out of the Earth than the dragon so we have all these contrasts in the Book of Revelation if we read the book of Jeremiah then we have a typological story of what this great\n\n(30:40) battle is all about you see there was a then time story where there was a real war between Babylon and the people of God and the Prophet Jeremiah is the one who warned against the coming of Babylon the coming of Babylon did the people like the message of Jeremiah nope they didn't like it one little bit\n\n(31:01) they lowered him into the system they beat him up they put him in stocks they did all kinds of terrible things to poor Jeremiah they didn't like the message nothing's changed by the way Jeremiah 2:1 has a nation changed their gods which are yet not Gods but my people have Chang their glory for that which does not\n\n(31:25) profit this is a battle about God's people be astonished though you Heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate says the Lord for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and have youed them out systems broken systems that cannot hold water there's a\n\n(31:46) story of what happened in literal Jerusalem versus Babylon do you think the same could happen in our time you think it's possible you think the Revelation might be trying to tell us something Jeremiah 2:26 as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of Israel ashamed and they their kings\n\n(32:08) their princes and their priests and their prophets saying to a stock Thou Art my father and to a stone thou H has brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their faces but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us so they're facing East they're worshiping a different\n\n(32:30) deity but where are thy gods that thou Hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy Gods oh Judah so did they have many Idols yes or no yeah do you think there will be many Idols in the last days I think so Deuteronomy\n\n(32:53) 4:28 and there you Shall Serve Gods the work of men's hands wood and Stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell Daniel 5:23 but has lifted up thyself against the Lord of Heaven and have brought the vessels of the house before thee and thou and thy Lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine\n\n(33:12) in them and thou has praised the gods of silver and gold of brass and iron and wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hands thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified same thing it's going to happen in our time so they served Idols today today we also have\n\n(33:34) Idols no difference let's just go to ancient times and I'll run you briefly through what the structures look like this is an ancient place called uras and uh it's in Syria and here are the ruins of an ancient city now we could go there with this transport but uh it seemed somewhat what flimsy so we opted for this luxury\n\n(34:02) vehicle over here and we drove many many hundreds of kilometers with this old Mercedes to this particular place and uh that's what it looked like totally trashed you cannot believe that a car like that can still drive and uh interesting statement on the front they strong car faster well the this uh Arab man took us\n\n(34:30) to this ancient city and here you can find the main gates and the towers and the houses and the temples of adonus and uh temples of Zas and all the ancient citadels this was a town after the formation of Christianity and in this town you had a Christian Church it's very interesting and if you look at the foundations\n\n(34:55) that's what it was just one little room and this is obviously where the Christians met and in the same town you had other temples so P people visited the Temple of adus for example he was the son he was the son of God if you like here was a counterfeit Son of God and what did that look like well did you\n\n(35:20) just see the foundations so obviously here was the building and you entered in over here and there was a Central Hall with two side Halls on the side and here stood pillars separating this Hall from the side halls and there were altars in the side halls and there was a main altar in the middle now who builds like\n\n(35:45) that today every single Cathedral on the face of the Earth has that structure every single Cathedral isn't that interesting now we could go into great detail there but we will not in same yes they're all built like that exactly uh here is the river Euphrates so we are dealing with a nice typology of Babylon if you like here\n\n(36:14) were steps leading up to the Temple of Zas the father of the Gods and if you go to Syria then the most famous one of course was the Great Goddess of The Fountains and uh this is the city where they're dinging this up Mari and they're finding some very interesting things down there they built with clay for\n\n(36:37) example clay bricks the Bible tells us that Babylon was constructed with Clay bricks here you have the Temple of bakus this is in Lebanon and fascinating what you find there this is a pillar a huge pillar found at Balck this was the largest pillar in the world until they found the other one this one was\n\n(37:00) discovered in '93 and you can see the size of the man next to it over there and uh that's me I'm just you know picking it up there no no sweat no no it's huge you cannot imagine the size of these structures these are actually not pillars here's one that was rejected there's a man standing over there as a scale and uh they transported\n\n(37:27) these and built them into their temples there's one of them lying over there the foundation Stones down here are these huge blocks of stone how they transported them nobody knows this is the bakus temple and uh it used to be the Temple of Bal that's why the town is still called Bal Beck I'm giving you some\n\n(37:49) history of the apostasy in the past so that we can compare it with the present here at Balck you have this Temple of bakus here is the Temple of Jupiter with its six pillars Still Standing very very beautiful and uh the sun striking the pillars it was a system of sun worship of course bakus the god of drunkenness\n\n(38:14) and rry maybe this pillar had had a little bit too much to drink I don't know and uh if you go in to the altar of Jupiter for example you found this structure this is exactly what the God quel cotle looks like in South America so you know where the South American Amica um religion came from then you had\n\n(38:36) Venus with winged Lions on the side the Bible talks about the lion with Eagle wings as a symbol of Babylon and you had this structure over here the circle with a cross in it was a symbol of Baal you'll find it in many many churches today if you go to the juper temple further you will find some interesting\n\n(38:59) structures Lions again certain reliefs on the pillars you had these swastikas all over they were a symbol of sun worship there they are somewhat enlarged you'll find this same swastika under the foot of Buddha Buddhism uses exactly the same symbol that was used in the temple of Bale uh you'll find it on Roman reliefs\n\n(39:26) in ancient times there you will find it even in the time of the Hittites the swastika you'll find the symbol of the circle with a dot in it used in the past uh you will find altars and uh sacrificial pillars three arches with three deities in it normally they would have the father the mother and the child in there here you have\n\n(39:54) another interesting symbol that is used today uh owls and Falcons very popular and interesting structures like this one for example what would you say that structure was it looks like the Star of David doesn't it now while the Star of David has nothing to do with David and I will you will not find the Star of David in\n\n(40:20) the Bible this is a star that was used even in the times of the Hittites it's a symbol of baale you'll find that Islam uses it there's the name Allah in the hexagram and here you will find Om in it Hinduism uses it was used in Bale worship the half moon with a star in it or the sickle Moon as is used in Islam\n\n(40:44) there you'll find it amongst the Hittites this symbol over here well there you find it being used in NATO by NATO today angels pigs a woman with a mini dress on with a golden cup in her hand these are symbols that tell us that the symbolism in the temples of Baal was identical to the symbolism used in The Book of Revelation\n\n(41:14) and in the world today and we are going to compare in this time that we're going to spend together what happened then and what is happening today a great apostasy towards God existed in the past a great apostasy exists today Christ is being dethroned today as he was dethroned in the past it is time to put him back into\n\n(41:42) the center and give him the rightful place which is rightfully his in our previous session we looked at some of the symbols that you found in the temples of ba and the temples of Bal and a very interesting symbol was this one over here that you find in Balck in the temple of Baal it's a woman with a\n\n(42:06) cup in her hand now the Book of Revelation speaks about a woman that writes the Beast that has a golden cup in her hand fascinating to find them in the various places if you go to these temples you will find that they were temples of death you will always find tombs in them and Bones did you know that there is not\n\n(42:31) a cathedral in the world where you will not walk on the corpses of men no Cathedral may be built without dead bodies in fact every Cathedral is a cemetery and you cannot say a mass in a cathedral or in a church if there is not a relic of a dead individual in that particular building so if you walk into the Great Cathedrals\n\n(42:57) you are walking on the bodies of men if you went to the temples of Baal you will find Little Angels where in the Bible do you read about little angels nowhere nowhere angels are described in the Bible as masculine and of great power and magnificent beings in the temple of Baal they were reduced to tiny\n\n(43:26) little C like angels fat little angels there they are in the Bale Temple where do you find them today you'll find them in all the churches now let's have a look up here interesting symbolism up against the ceiling let's draw it a little bit closer you'll find the eagle standing on a key there are many churches that use\n\n(43:47) this symbolism today there you have the great god Osiris with wings and the pine cones and you'll find the gods and the goddesses of licentiousness if you like within the hexagrams and the hexagons and you'll find the hexagrams and the hexagons on the ceilings of the temples of Baal like you can see them over there\n\n(44:14) if you look up this is the city of Palms Palmira and it has the longest column still in existence today even today there are palm trees over there and this is the longest Roman colonade still existing and if you look at it it is magnificent and if you look into the back there you'll see the temple of Bell\n\n(44:39) now the word Bell today is used by industry exclusively uh and you'll find many many Illusions to Bell in the world today there is the Temple of bell this is the best preserved Temple of Bell in the world basically basically another form of ball and if that's the courtyard on the outside that was the place where they\n\n(45:04) did their offering they also had a holy place and a Most Holy place it was structured on the same plan basically as that of Israel but of course Satan is an angel fallen from heaven and he had the plan as well so he is a counterfeit of the Heavenly story if you look up against the ceiling you have symbols and you have palm\n\n(45:30) trees and you have these deities represented as pine cones and pomegranates and pineapples and uh you'll find Halos around them around the Sun deities again you will find feathers and and uh Eagles and interesting things up against the walls which we don't even have to talk about this is a very interesting\n\n(45:54) one this is the flame of Lucifer is the flame of Bale what's it look like looks exactly like an Olympic torch exactly like an Olympic torch in fact they just lit one the other day if you watch television and they said a prayer to whom Apollo the sun god it's not dead today it's just disguised of course you have the grapes\n\n(46:24) for Bas you have the fles and the the triangles and the sphinxes with their breasts female representations there is one and uh angels with wings amongst the pine cones and here is this upside down triangle with eagles in it this symbolism is used today in all the mighty political entities of the world\n\n(46:51) so we have a lot of things to look at in the Book of Revelation the eagle in its various forms is the is the symbol of Many Many Nations so the Book of Revelation is going to tell us about this great conflict between good and evil this great conflict between idolatry and the worship of the true God and we're going to look at things which\n\n(47:20) will stun you we're going to look at the intricacies of the workings behind the scenes how the world today is really moving towards the enthronement of another power and the Book of Revelation warns us about these things so now let's go through the first chapter verse by verse the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to\n\n(47:48) show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass wonderful so he's going to tell us ahead of time what's going to happen now if someone has the power to tell you accurately ahead of time what's going to happen isn't that somebody that you could trust I would say so in fact prophecy changed me from being an\n\n(48:11) atheist to being a Believer and experience taught me to follow Christ he's not just on paper he's real he's believable he's trustworthy his promises are yay and amen he says I will never leave you nor forsake you and I have found him to be trustworthy and he sent shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his\n\n(48:43) Angel unto his servant John so John is now receiving this Revelation who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw so even though we are going to talk about terrible terrible things in the lectures to come and I'm telling you again it will be like you\n\n(49:03) have never heard it before and people might say to me why are you concentrating on what the evil side is doing why not just talk about Jesus I wish I could do that I wish I could talk just about Jesus but there's a problem how would you feel if you had a child that you really really love let's talk about love let's say you had a\n\n(49:37) child and you really really loved that child but you know that that child is busy with wrong things and that that child is going to be destroyed if it carries on along that path how would you feel what would you do it's no point saying to the child mommy loves you because the child is infatuated with\n\n(50:06) whatever it's doing surely if your child is on drugs it's very important to show the child that you love the child but isn't it also important to warn the child yes or no yes so what do we do when we do this we educate the child on what on the dangers of drugs right and we tell the child this is what's going to happen this that that\n\n(50:31) and the other do they listen no something else has to happen in the heart but these things are important for the child to make a decision in the end or what if you find your child joining some I don't know some vicious group that eventually will lead to the child's destruction wouldn't you like to tell\n\n(50:54) the child here and here and here and he has the deception of what this particular organization or group is doing yes or no wouldn't you want to save that child out of all those problems so yes unfortunately it is so that there are many deceptions in many things that lead on the broad path to destruction and we're going to have\n\n(51:20) to reveal them and that is painful and it's going to be talking about the negative but why do we do it because we want people to choose the positive and if we can take all the parameters in the world and we can say this one is deceptive because of this that one because of this this one because of that\n\n(51:45) eventually only one remains and that's Jesus Christ so basically what we are doing is we are going to follow a process of exclusion we're going to look at the various components of Babylon and then maybe we'll discover that all of us have been trapped all of us have been lied to every single one of us as we sit here today has been\n\n(52:19) deceived it's terrible thought but in the end it crystallizes out that there's only one one that can be trusted and that is Jesus Christ and he alone can save you I am the door I am the way I am the word he who believes in me shall never perish that's what he said either it's the truth or it's a lie if the world wants to come\n\n(52:51) together and join one big happy family and we all have to tolerate every single thing that is being taught in the world is that truth or is a truth mingled with error you tell me so we have to find out whether all paths lead to God or whether only one part leads to God and we have to decide on the basis\n\n(53:20) of that so bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw the word of God and the Prophecies of the Bible will'll have to understand them blessed is he that readeth and that hear the words of the prophecy and keep the things that are written therein for\n\n(53:42) the time is at hand Revelation 1:3 verse4 John to the seven churches which are in Asia we're going to deal with them in the next lecture in detail Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne now obviously the\n\n(54:03) Bible teaches that there is one God Father Son and Holy Spirit so the number seven here is the number of perfection also we'll see that there are seven time periods he's going to discuss the events over time periods divided into seven so the seven spirits before God is one spirit of God perfect number seven in\n\n(54:30) all time throughout history one spirit so we mustn't get confused and have more Spirits than they are because the Bible has to be in harmony with itself and then the greatest part about Revelation chapter 1 is it tells us who and what the author is and it's written in an amazing fashion it's written in a\n\n(54:54) way which is called an EP now an epad is like a kaym except that instead of describing events it a quotes in a certain sequence so for example this epad consists of a series of quotes which want to highlight a particular Point Isaiah 55:4 you read about a witness and it's a quote from uh it's Revelation 1:5 and it's a quote\n\n(55:23) from Isaiah and if you go to the end of it there's another quote in Revelation 1:16 which is also from Isaiah then there is another point the second Point mentioned Revelation 1:7 talks about the coming with the clouds it's a quote from Daniel 7:13 and then you have one at the end here Revelation 133 where it talks about\n\n(55:44) the priest and it's a quote from Daniel 79 and so the first and the last is from Isaiah the second and the second last is from Daniel the third and the third last is from Zachariah and then there are two in the middle boom boom that lifts out the central theme that's an epad and the central theme is I am the\n\n(56:08) Alpha and the Omega if you take one away you don't have an epad there must be two in the middle so some Bibles say but the Bible repeats itself why say this twice take out the one we you destroy the structure you cannot take one word out of the Bible or you're in trouble man shall not live by bread alone but\n\n(56:34) by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the lord well we better make sure we read all of it all of it whole lecture coming on that topic fascinating stuff anyway the Book of Revelation chapter 1 proves that Jesus Christ is The Great I Am he is God now that's a problem today that's a problem because if Jesus\n\n(57:04) Is God and if Jesus is the way the truth and the life and if Jesus is the only way whereby you can be saved well then you have a problem if you want to be in the same pot with all the other religions of the world because Jesus has to become a little bit less in order to to fit into the same level as all the others now we have a\n\n(57:32) problem obviously the world cannot afford one group to say that it has a superior religion over any other group would you agree with me in the world that we're living today you cannot have that so Jesus has to be made a little bit less so that the others can be a little bit more how do you achieve that\n\n(57:57) you create the pain of exclusiveness in other words you make it so painful to be exclusive that you'd rather choose to be less exclusive does that make sense think about that either he is what he says he is or he is not what he says he is and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten\n\n(58:19) of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood does this tell us what Jesus is all about yes or no is this exclusive and special or is this something on a power with everyone else I'm not knocking any other religion I'm just asking is Jesus on a par with\n\n(58:44) let's say Buddha in this particular text yes or no is he on a par with zoraster is he on a par with Shiva yes or no Osiris yes or no no because this one's different he loved us he washed us he's the king of kings he's the prince of all of them and he's the only one who can save because he's the only one who is what God do you know\n\n(59:17) what the difference is between Christianity and all the other religions of the world the difference is that Christ's tomb is empty Christianity is the only religion on the face of the Earth that gives a reason for the state of the planet the mesin and it's the only religion on the face of the Earth that has a solution to\n\n(59:41) the problem all the other religions find their solution in their own works and if they don't succeed now try try and try again through various reincarnations until you finally get it right is it getting better or is it getting worse and they're obviously not doing too well at it right so Christianity gives a\n\n(1:00:04) reason and it gives a solution and it tells us why and it tells us how there's no other religion on the face of the Earth that does this and Christianity has the word of God which is the infallible will of God which has been attacked at every single level from the scientific level right through to the historic level to the level of the\n\n(1:00:29) Salvation and you know what the Bible has stood the test of time it's the only book on the face of the Earth that has been Vindicated scientifically archaeologically historically and in terms of its salvation premise it picks people up from where they are and changes them into something else there is no other\n\n(1:00:55) book like it and even if the whole world teaches something else as they are at the moment believe me they do then pick up those videos about creation and evolution and have a look at them make up your mind on the base of the scientific facts I was a professor at the University for more than 30 years and I was professor of\n\n(1:01:19) zoology and I was probably the only one in secular University that didn't believe in evolution that took some doing and he has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever behold he comes with the clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred of the\n\n(1:01:45) Earth shall whail because of him even so Amen in other words rather than having this Sumptuous Joy at the coming of Christ most of them will what whail here's a different story to what is being taught even in the world of Christianity where everybody is waiting for the restoration of the kingdom and a\n\n(1:02:09) second chance some believe no we don't even have to wait for every eye to see them because we'll be raptured away does the bible teach that I am the Alpha and the Omega there's the center of the OS the beginning and the ending says the Lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty that's pretty Straight Talk\n\n(1:02:35) Jesus Christ in the Book of Revelation is identified not just as king of kings the savior of the world but he's identified as God if we make Jesus Christ any less than he is then I'm afraid we have no savior because then that savior would be in the the same boat that we are in so he's God I John who also am your\n\n(1:03:04) brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the aisle of cold pmos for the word of God so if you preach the word you're in trouble and for the testimony of Jesus Christ which is the prophetic word over all time so if you preach prophecy you're going to get into\n\n(1:03:23) trouble so are you all prepared for what's coming we're going to look at some of these things and it's scary we're going to look at very interesting things I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet Revelation 1 8 to10 so on what day was he in the spirit I was in the spirit on the Lord's\n\n(1:03:47) Day Revelation 1:10 If thy turn thy foot away from the Sabbath from doing my pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath of delight the holy of the Lord honorable Isaiah 5813 it's the only one that is called the holy day of the Lord so obviously he was in spirit on the Sabbath day but Mark also talks about the fact that the\n\n(1:04:19) son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath so obviously he was in Vision on this day on the Sabbath day and God showed him what was going to happen in the world saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia now I'm\n\n(1:04:48) not going to deal with a details because I'm going to deal with them in the next lecture unto Ephesus Smyrna pergamus th sardus Philadelphia laia each name has a particular meaning even the location has a meaning Revelation 1:1 and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned I saw seven golden\n\n(1:05:21) candlesticks where does he see Jesus in which chamber does he see Jesus he sees him in the Holy place so obviously we have a time setting the ministry of the high priest is taking place in the Holy place not in the most holy holy so this is not Yong kipur the day of judgment this is prior to the final\n\n(1:05:48) judgment so we are historically in a time before the close of of probation Jesus is ministering in the Holy place that's where he sees him because he sees him ministering amongst the seven candlesticks historically that's important so if you look at the old postal route and you look at the various cities Ephesus Smyrna pergamum\n\n(1:06:19) th Sardis Philadelphia laia that's the old postal route and we going to deal with that in the next lecture so he has this great vision of ministering between seven golden candlesticks and the Candlestick stands for the light of the world Jesus is the light of the world Revelation 13 and in the midst of the seven\n\n(1:06:45) candlesticks one like unto the son of man Jesus the high priest the ministering high priest he's the one who is the light of the world he's the one who is the bread from Heaven the bread of the presence he is the one that mediates on your behalf he is the altar of incense and the incense rising up is\n\n(1:07:10) the ministry of Christ in making our prayers acceptable through God to God through his mediation he is the one who deals and works in us to change our hearts of stone to Hearts of Flesh that's the picture that we have of a caring Jesus Christ who is in control who knows exactly what's going to happen\n\n(1:07:33) and fortells Us in detail how he permits apostasy to take on the form that it is even in our time now you know this amazes me if I were God there would be a problem thank God I'm not going heart because I wouldn't have the patience that he has to deal with aasy the way he does and how he permits it to\n\n(1:08:09) grow and to reach fruit so that everyone can see it for what it is by the way if you look at the world out there today is it a pleasant place no it's not a pleasant place in some countries I come from South Africa our houses are like jails murders Left Right incented 4,000 Farmers already murdered believe that or\n\n(1:08:38) not it's horrendous what's happening and nobody even knows if you take a country like Zimbabwe they're just driving them off the lands and there is no sanctity of anything anymore we're living in really terrible times it is not safe for a young girl it is not safe for a young man these days to go jogging alone what kind of world\n\n(1:09:05) are we living in and if you look at the horrendous things that are done in the world today sometimes you wonder how can God permit this God is permitting sin and apostasy to ripen to the point where everybody will see what it means to choose against God's righteous ways and man's ways and that is an act of love and in the midst\n\n(1:09:39) of the fear and the confusion there's a quiet place where he calls and he says come unto me you who are wearied and heavy laden and I will give you rest so we can find peace in the midst of confusion and we can choose we can choose to walk through life and look at the thorns and the Briar and the thistles or we could choose to look at\n\n(1:10:09) the flowers and the lies and the Beautiful fruit the choice is ours and if we choose the one we will choose sadness if we choose the other one in the midst of sadness we can have peace and that's what Jesus Christ is all about he's the one in the midst of the candlesticks he is the light of the world but the candlesticks represents\n\n(1:10:31) the churches that are to carry the light to the world throughout all the ages and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to his foot and G about perhaps with a golden girdle I'm quoting the King James so sometimes it sounds a bit oldfashioned but uh at least we have all\n\n(1:10:52) the words there his hair his head and his hair were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as the flame of fire nothing escapes him perfect righteousness his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters Revelation 13-15 this was the voice of\n\n(1:11:16) God Jesus is described as God not a created being he was the one that was and that is and that is to come from all eternity the one who initiated the process of creation the one who spoke and it stood fast that's how he is described here the vision that we have of him here is the one that Daniel had\n\n(1:11:39) Ezekiel described him like this he is seeing yve that's who he's seeing and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword it's the word of God and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength so there you have the true son of righteousness and the feeble counterfeit is son\n\n(1:12:05) worship and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last and if you take one message home tonight it's this one in spite of what we're going to deal with in the lectures fear not I am the first the last I am he that liveth and was dead\n\n(1:12:28) and behold I am alive forever more amen and I have the keys of hell and of death he's the only one who can save you and he has promised to do it write the things which thou Hast seen the things which are and the things which shall be here after here's a key how do we interpret what the Book of Revelation is going to\n\n(1:12:54) say it deals with what you have seen which is right now so which are the prophet is looking at Visions and they apply to that time and the things which shall be Hereafter what's that future future so how do we read the book of Revelation surely if that is the key then it applies to what happened then throughout history into the future\n\n(1:13:31) yes or no God is fair is he going to write a book and put it in his Bible and give it to every generation and say Here's a book but it's not for you where it's only for those who live in a couple of thousand years or is God going to put information for every generation in his book yes or no God is just he's fair but we have\n\n(1:13:55) whole groups today which take the Book of Revelation and apply it only to the Future in fact to a generation that will not even be here when it happens in fact to whole church that will be gone and raptured when it is supposed to happen does that make any sense no The Book of Revelation is historic continuous what what happened then is\n\n(1:14:26) applicable to the people living then what happened in the next generation is applicable to them and we have the whole story all the way through to the end it applies to us all and particularly of course to the great culminating events in the history of time the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sawest in my right hand\n\n(1:14:49) important because on the right other saved on the left other damned and the Seven golden stand Candlestick the Seven Stars are the Angels Angel is a messenger of the seven churches the seven churches of God in time periods the preachers if you like those carrying the message they are in the right hand of God he's in control in\n\n(1:15:15) spite of what's Happening remember God is in control and the Seven candlesticks which thou servest are the seven churches God has this amazing Ministry that he uses Fallen man to preach the word wow he could have done it himself he could have thundered it from Heaven he could have used Angels but he uses us that's\n\n(1:15:44) incredible so the ministry of Christ in the Heavenly sanctuary if you look at the great story of how it all happened when Christ rose from the dead where did did he go when he rose to the rose from the dead he went up into heaven to serve in the sanctuary says the U book of Hebrews in a Heavenly Sanctuary so we have a\n\n(1:16:06) Heavenly Ministry we won't be dealing with the details in this particular lecture and it stretches from then to the end of time and it's divided up in the sanctuary language where you have all the symbols like the candlesticks and the bread and the altar of incense in the first ch chamber and the second\n\n(1:16:26) chamber and then we know where we are in the Stream of time so that we don't get lost in the Book of Revelation and he said unto me unto 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Daniel 8:14 so it goes right up to a particular time in history we're not dealing with this prophecy either there's a whole\n\n(1:16:49) lecture on it and you can find it in uh one of the tapes but just a little bit of background in Daniel 8 we have this story of an unfolding of an amazing prophecy so he came near Where I Stood this Angel and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face but he said unto me understand oh son of man for the at the time of the\n\n(1:17:13) end shall be the vision not the end of time the time of the end and while I was speaking in prayer the man Gabriel the angel came to me in Swift flight and and he said to me oh Daniel I have now come to out to give you wisdom and understanding and then he proceeds to give a most amazing prophecy which is a\n\n(1:17:37) Messianic prophecy the most perfect prophecy that you can possibly imagine it gives the time when the Messiah should come so accurately that in the talut you read May the bones of the hands and the the bones of the fingers Decay and decompose of him who turns the pages of the Book of Daniel to find out the time of Daniel\n\n(1:18:05) 9:24-27 this is written in the talut and may his memory rot from of the face of the Earth forever talmudic law page 978 section 2 why would the Jewish talut contain such a curse for someone who tries to number the time of Daniel 9:24-27 I'll tell you why because it tells you exactly when the Messiah will come it tells you\n\n(1:18:39) exactly what the Messiah will do we're not dealing with this prophecy in detail as I said there is a whole video on it you can get it if you want to there's also a book written on it so the fact of the matter is that only one Messiah in the history of mankind applies and that's Jesus Christ no one else and if they were to accept Daniel\n\n(1:19:04) 9:24-27 what would have to happen with the Jewish religion it would have to become the Christian religion and it would disappear of the face of the Earth something that they do not want and so rather curse the one who uses it it tells us when a decree would go forth it tells us when the Messiah would start\n\n(1:19:31) his ministry it tells us when the Messiah would die 31 ad and it tells us when the gospel would go to the Gentiles a amazing prophecy it's a 2,300 year prophecy dealing with this tremendous time period from the issuing of the decree to restore Jerusalem all the way until the time of judgment there's a\n\n(1:19:57) date there 1844 because the 2,300 day prophecy if you add it all together 2,300 years from there in the Bible it tells us in the book of numbers that and in the Book of Ezekiel that you can take a day for a prophetic year then you get to an interesting date which we will deal with in another lecture far too complicated to deal with\n\n(1:20:19) it now and then there is a time which the Bible calls the time of the end and we're living in that time right now and then when one time we will come to the point of Eternity and the Bible teaches that Jesus is following the same Ministry that was typified in that Sanctuary service on Earth Hebrews 9:11\n\n(1:20:44) but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building not an Earthly one neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place hagon having obtained Eternal Redemption\n\n(1:21:13) for us very important Point that's what the King James says some Modern translations don't like this so they've changed this to Most Holy place big problem because now the whole Ministry of Christ shift but that's a complicated story we'll deal with it it can't be holy place it has to can't be most holy\n\n(1:21:34) Place must be holy place because if it were most holy it wouldn't say hagon it would say haon which it doesn't say it says that which actually means Sanctuary Hebrews 9:12 not with the blood of goats and cves but with his own blood so this ministry could only start once Jesus had died so Jesus must have entered the\n\n(1:22:00) sanctuary to start his ministry only after his death which means he entered into the first chamber and not into the second chamber because the high priest only entered that once a year and in the Book of Revelation where do we see Jesus serving in chapter 1 where the candlesticks are so why are they trying to twist the Bible here and\n\n(1:22:23) they complicated thoughts just put them in the back of your mind don't worry about them we don't have to understand everything first shot we'll get to that later get clearer Hebrews 9:3 and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all ha haon the high priest went once a year that was a\n\n(1:22:45) different story and uh when did Jesus do that obviously sometime after his resurrection so the question I have to you tonight is if we have a high priest and if that high priest is God and if that high priest is the only one who through his blood can save you then we have to choose him over all others if there is no other name under\n\n(1:23:17) Heaven and Earth whereby you may be saved then we have to choose him over all others but I have news for you if you do you will get into trouble sooner or later either in the immediate circle or in the greater Circle but as for me in my house I have decided to serve the Lord and I would like to invite you to do the\n\n(1:23:45) same thank you [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
  "# Title:207_seven_churches_total_onslaught_walter_veith_thegreatcontroversy_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSeven Churches Prophecy,Historical Church Periods,Compromise and Apostasy,Reformation and Renewal,Laodicean Church Condition\n\n## Guide:\nThis extensive presentation delves into the symbolic meaning of the seven churches in the Book of Revelation, interpreting them as a prophetic historical timeline of the Christian Church. The speaker, Walter Veith, emphasizes the importance of reading Revelation \"in a historic continuous way,\" highlighting how Jesus Christ is the central figure who offers restoration from humanity's fallen state. Each churchâ€”Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodiceaâ€”represents a distinct period, characterized by specific commendations, reproofs, and promises, and often correlated with historical events and geographical locations in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey). A significant theme throughout is the church's struggle against compromise and pagan influences, ultimately leading to a call for genuine faith and adherence to God's Word, rather than relying on human tradition or superficial \"works.\" The lecture culminates with the Laodicean church, depicted as lukewarm and self-sufficient, serving as a stark warning about spiritual complacency in the final period of church history.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 207 - Seven Churches _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaPE0f6jtig\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] and now we're going to deal with the seven churches we've already seen that we are supposed to read it in a historic continuous way blessed is he that readeth and that hear the word of the prophecy and keep the things that are written therein for the time is at hand Revelation 13 the time is for each\n\n(01:28) time in history that there was a time at hand and of course particularly for our time I was in the spirit in the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet and then we looked at the great epad in Revelation chapter 1 telling us that Jesus is the center of the whole book the whole Bible that he\n\n(01:54) is The Great I Am we looked at how in the book of Genesis man lost access to the Tree of Life Death came in he had earned his bread lost Dominion became naked and was driven from God and we looked in the first chapter on how there was a restoration to come in uh access to the Tree of Life victory over death\n\n(02:20) the hidden Mana Jesus the one that would take away the spiritual hunger for all time Dominion was to be restored white clothes and no more separation from God and we also saw in that first chapter very briefly that the seven churches represent the old postal route starting with Ephesus going to Smyrna pergamum th\n\n(02:49) Sardis Philadelphia and ludia isn't it amazing that that is the sequence in which they occur and how the postal roote went and it's also the sequence in which they are mentioned God is truly amazing write the things which thou Hast seen then time application the things which are and the things which are Hereafter\n\n(03:19) future application The Mystery of the Seven Stars which thou sourced in the right hand of the seven golden candlesticks the Seven Stars are the angel The Messengers if you like of the seven churches the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches so the church is the medium through which\n\n(03:41) Christ disseminates the truth so let's go to Turkey Asia Minor where we find these churches this is the city of Istanbul and here you'll find some of the most beautiful mosques in the world you'll find remnant here of the great battle between the religions the Ottoman Empire great for of the Ottomans bridges over the\n\n(04:10) prosperous marriages people living there today like they live everywhere in the world everybody is seeking A Place in the Sun everybody is looking for someone to love this is a young couple that is engaged she's wearing pink here and uh there's the coach on top of one of the Seven Hills of Istanbul Constantinople it's one of the cities\n\n(04:40) with Seven Hills Rome is the other one with Seven Hills it's interesting that both were capitals of the Roman Empire and uh here is the Great Blue Mosque in Istanbul tremendous building representing one of the great religions of the world and we'll be dealing with some of these issues as we go on in the\n\n(05:03) Book of Revelation this is s sopia very interesting place it's a museum today it used to be in Byzantine times it used to be a Christian Church when the Muslims took over during the B post Byzantine period they changed it into a mosque and today it's a museum it's interesting that in this church they had the Christian reliefs pain\n\n(05:30) painted up against the walls and when the Muslims took over they whitewashed them they just took white wash and they painted over them and so they were gone to the site and now over the ages the white wash has faded so when you walk into the church you actually see the Christian reliefs peeping through and\n\n(05:50) you see which is something which to me is quite symbolic it seems as if the great barriers between the religions are just coming down and uh they're sort of blending into one and interesting time that the world is facing this is the the underground channels where you can do your shopping it's very dark down there\n\n(06:14) of course a very interesting country Turkey one of the great countries to visit excellent facilities beautiful food third world first world all in one the great city of Troy was there so it's the remnant of that City and uh this is what's left of the town of traz this is where Paul preached one night and he must have been uh uh a\n\n(06:42) tedious preacher who kept on for hours and hours such as myself because poor old uus couldn't take it anymore fell asleep like they sometimes do in mind too and crashed down from the window and broke his neck and the miracle took place where Paul prayed over him and he was healed this was the place today it's\n\n(07:05) just a little Harbor place where fishermen sort of launch their boats and uh this is where we have the setting of the seven churches in this area so each of the seven churches where Christ is represented as disseminating his light to the world each of these names have a particular meaning and they have a prophetic meaning there's a\n\n(07:34) certain character in each of these churches that is described which applies to them at that time and has a future application into the future then the churches get a commendation something that they are doing right and uh it's interesting that there is a church that does not have a commendation but we'll come to that\n\n(07:59) later then there is reproof and reproof is very important because it tells us something about the time period again if you are being reproved and asked to repent is probation then over yes or no obviously not because if you can still repent after reproof well then probation cannot be over and so you cannot take this\n\n(08:25) prophecy and throw it into the future after the close of probation that would do violence not only to the terminology but would do violence to the structure where it occurs it is set by the kayma into the historic arm Christ is ministering in the Holy place not in the most holy so this is a time period of\n\n(08:50) his ministry which does not pertain to the time of the end although the prophecy proceeds throughout the entire Christian time even even into that time so there's a reproof there's a counsel and then there is a promise that's the basic structure of all the letters to the churches now the first one is the town\n\n(09:14) of Ephesus was a very prosperous town today these are the ruins of Ephesus here is the great Street of curet this is where Paul must have walked when he ministered in this particular town and the name Ephesus means desirable so it's a desirable condition to be in this church has something going for it and if\n\n(09:40) it is the first in a period because remember it says what is and what is to come historic continuous until the end of time because that's how God works he has concern for every generation then it must be the first period of Christianity and uh if we study the events we can put an arbitrary time on it probably to\n\n(10:04) about ad 100 and we can learn something about the what is what it was like then as it applies to the church in history as well well in Ephesus there was the seat of Diana and Diana was the mother of the Gods this is where Paul had his great argument about this very issue because he said Jesus is is the only way and\n\n(10:31) then there was this big tumults because they said no no he's putting down Diana our goddess and uh they wanted to take him to taskque so she was the mother of the Gods there was a temple of Diana which was built in 480 BC it's interesting that the the Christian Council the Council of Ephesus was held in this very Town\n\n(10:57) Ephesus and then the title Mother of God was given to Mary so there's some interesting little correlations over there with the seat of the mother of the Gods and here a title was given to Mary in this town as well so that's the setting of this church let's read the letter to the church Revelation 2:1-3 unto the angel of the Church of\n\n(11:24) Ephesus writ these things says he that hold us the Seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks we've dealt with this text already I Know Thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou can not bear them which are evil that's the Commendation so Jesus is saying to them\n\n(11:50) I can see what you're doing I am happy with what you are doing and you have discernment between good and evil and thou H has tried them which say they are Apostles so even in this early period there were some who were trying to lead astray yes or no but they tried them and what was the standard whereby they\n\n(12:14) discerned whether they were from the good side or the bad side must be the word of God that's the standard how they you tried them and which say that they are Apostles and are not so they were deceivers and Liars then in the early church and we will see that in the lectures that come and has found them Liars how do you\n\n(12:37) find them Liars what standard do you use to find them Liars your feeling or must you have something to base it on surely you must have something to base it on the word of God and has born and has patience and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted that's a good Commendation for the church at\n\n(13:00) Ephesus they still had their act together but there's a reproof nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love so that first fire that the church had that fire with you feel when you become converted and you go off and you run to bring the message they had cool down somewhat remember therefore from whence\n\n(13:27) thou had fallen and repent turn around and do the first works so complacency had set in to an extent but they knew right from wrong that was good they worked and labored for God that was good but that firstborn Zeal that was slightly tainted or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy Candlestick\n\n(13:54) out of his place so here was the time period that if a church did not live up to whatever truth they had then God would do what take that Candlestick away from them and give it to someone else very important point so in this time period we're still dealing in a time in history that if you don't live up to the light\n\n(14:20) that you have God will eventually take the light and give it to someone else to carry it but this they Hast that thou hatest that's strange God hates something and he commends them for hating something here haest The Deeds of the nications which I also hate h remember now this is a very important Point God\n\n(14:51) hates the Deeds does he hate the people no for God so loved the world that he gave his only begot begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life God loves people but he hates false systems of worship so the early church had the discernment to hate the nians who were\n\n(15:18) the nians what were they Nicolas nicolon they were a group that taught they were a sect a gnostic sect that taught that the law of God did not apply to Man In the Flesh because man was spirit and flesh and therefore what he did in the flesh did not apply to his spirituality it's a very common thought\n\n(15:46) today as well so what the nians taught then they teach today Nicolas was posidon worship it was the god of the sea the nicolan Nicolas Nicolas have you heard that name today yes today we worship at The Shrine of s Nicolas you won't find him in history you can look it up in the encyclopedia branica it says that he is a fictitious\n\n(16:23) individual probably from posidon worship very interesting Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ is Savior Jesus Christ is the one who saves us now we celebrate his birthday on what day the 25th of December now the Bible says that the Shepherds were out on the fields so it couldn't have been the 25th of December\n\n(16:59) the god zus his birthday was on the 25th of December the god Osiris his birthday was on the 25th of December I can go through all the ancient gods the chief deities had their birthday on the 25th of December now if Christmas which means Christ Mass was really the birthday of Christ then why are we celebrating Nicolas on that\n\n(17:37) particular day isn't it interesting and the kids are asked to ask whom for their gifts Nicolas and he rides through the sky just like the ancient gods rode through the sky on the 25th of December on a chariot drawn if he was zeed by a goat but if he happened to be a Nordic God and we have a Nordic religion because\n\n(18:06) that's where we come from we come from the Goths then he happened to be drawn by reindeer and he could discern right from wrong he was eternal he lived forever year to year he could tell which child was good and which was not he handed out the gifts and there he went on the 25th of December and children from day forget\n\n(18:29) about Jesus Christ and say father Christmas is that right or wrong so actually what we are celebrating is Nicolas day and we love the Nicolaitans but the ear Church hated them not the individuals but the system to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God\n\n(18:56) revelation 24-6 today Christ is being supplanted by the system in a little way but it's much worse than what it actually appears here's the street of CET and this is where Paul must have walked down this is where all the statues of the leading figures of the Town stood and each one had a head on and if you had lots of\n\n(19:18) money you had a sculptor make your head and place it on there and you paid rents like you pay for your telephone or whatever your house and if you ran out of money and defaulted on your payment off came your head and somebody else was went on there who could pay the rent and so when you walk down there there you\n\n(19:38) were in your full Glory if you could pay the rent here was the temple to the emperor Trojan temples like these of course were dedicated to many gods and the emperor was of course the Roman Emperor was a deity he was a reincarnation of the sun Gods the town hall as it was beautiful library in Ephesus Temple of\n\n(20:06) Daman another Emperor worship another part of it then you had of course the ancient Scholastica figures here later on the Byzantine Church left its marks and uh if you were to Plumbing the plumbing was good these pipes lasted throughout all this time there was the public toy and underneath there was a river so that\n\n(20:32) whatever happened was immediately transported away nothing's changed we also have a river we just pull a chain to get it going and uh there you sat and you could chat to your neighbor about whatever was happening in your life here were the Scholastic ABS the goddess atmus the one with the many breasts to\n\n(20:52) feed the Nations and this was the amphitheater in which all the tumult took place when the gold or the silver smith uh who was responsible for making all the statues of Diana got very upset when Paul preached a different God and uh The Story Goes that Paul escaped from here so this early church commendable Church it uh stuck to the\n\n(21:18) ways it had discernment between good and evil it didn't allow Pagan worship to infiltrate into the church they discerned between right and wrong Jesus was the center of their religion they were a little bit complacent but otherwise pretty good the first time period was the same Ephesus was a Harbor City and today there's no Harbor in fact\n\n(21:41) the sea is many kilometers away has been filled in by silt and about 800 ad it ceased to be a Harbor City it's interesting in terms of time and evolutionary sequences uh this study in Ephesus today you find that Rome has set up this structure which was apparently seen in a vision as the place where Mary\n\n(22:08) lived because John came from Ephesus and Jesus said behold your mother and so he took her to live with him in Ephesus but this has been determined to be a fake but nevertheless this is where many come to worship at the feet of Mary all religions come to worship their Catholic then you have pilgrimages of Protestants even Islamic\n\n(22:38) Nations come to that particular place well the next time period is smna 100 probably to 313 ad because this was a time period of tremendous persecution the word mer is hidden hidden in the word smna and it means sweet smelling an aroma of sacrifice now if you take the city itself there was a shrine to the goddess Nemesis poly was\n\n(23:08) their first Minister and he was martyred interesting and in this depiction over here we have a 10 days of persecution the Bible says take a day for a year was there a period in the early church history when there was tremendous persecution for about 10 years and the answer is yes there was an emperor by the name of Dian who decreed\n\n(23:36) a persecution time period which was very acute and ended in 313 ad so from 303 to 3133 when Constantine put on the garve of Christianity over his Pagan body and Christianity became the official religion so let's have a read what it says here to this particular church and unto the angel of the church in SMA write these things\n\n(24:09) says the first and the last which was dead and is alive I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty so they were having a tough time the early church grew very rapidly things were going pretty well until this religion started to challenge the official religion and then persecution broke out and as soon\n\n(24:31) as you challenge the paradigms of the world persecution I Know Thy Works thy tribulation thy poverty but Thou Art rich and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews Christians the early church used the word Jews for Christians interchangeably and are not but are the synagogue of Satan so there are two\n\n(25:02) churches on this world those representing God and his son and those representing another power now this church has a commendation here but there's no reproof none whatsoever fear none of those things which Thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cost some of you in prison and there you may be tried and shall have\n\n(25:27) tribulation 10 days there you have a particular time period mentioned Dian persecution took that time period be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life there's the promise of restoration he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be\n\n(25:51) hurt by the second death interesting theology there that we can deal with in later lectures Revelation 210 to1 so here is a church no reproof it's one of only two churches in these seven churches that has no reproof only a commendation so this is very desirable but what did it take to get them like that persecution you see under\n\n(26:23) times of persecution the Dr is separated and what happens under persecution is that those who are known for their form of religion they fall away because it becomes too painful to hold on to the form so they give it up so if you really want to stand in times of persecution you better be grounded on the rock you\n\n(26:50) better know what you believe and why you believe it and that is why the Book of Revelation is very important because it tells us that there will be a time of trouble such as never was and we'd better believe what we believe if we want to stand in that time so was there ever such a persecution was there ever a Dian well I'll take you\n\n(27:16) back to that city of Palms Pala with this long Roman column as we saw it in the previous lecture and uh here are the pillars of the Bal temple in the backgrounds and these great archers and as you go through that City you come to this board which says dioclesian Camp interesting so this Emperor had his camp and his\n\n(27:45) soldiers here from where he conducted his persecution of the early Christian Church very interesting and this persecution cleansed the Church of all Hangers On for bread and fish but those who clung to the Rock they were commended so this was the great dioclesian camp and modern smna is called ishir\n\n(28:13) it's quite a modern Capital over there this is all that's left of ancient smyna not much but it tells an interesting story in time these are young people laughing and having fun in Smyrna like they have everywhere else in the world you know what I think God loves them and God would love them to have a full\n\n(28:34) knowledge of the truth as he would like you and me to have a full knowledge of the truth but if you have truth and you stand for it this is what can happen persecution this is the Coliseum where they were per persecuted where Nero set the Christians Al light he used them as human tortures they were fed to the\n\n(28:56) Lions great suffering and death took place here as uh people were destroyed through hatred between religions well let's see whether they compromised peramos means elevation lift up lift up what lift up the self over the Divine haven't we heard today about self when you switch on the television don't you hear that you have\n\n(29:33) to find your strength in your way inside and you have to change yourself from the inside and you have to do all these things yourself that's the new way to Salvation peramos lifting up man's way over God's way and that is idolatry so the capital of the Roman province of Asia there was a temple of Zas also of esclipus the serpent God man\n\n(30:09) instructing serpent the healing serpent wrapped around the pole do we use that symbol today yes the medical world uses it today the proconsul of pergamos had a double-edged sword and it's very interesting that this city was the Bastion of the Babylonian priesthood you see when Babylon had been conquered by Meo Persia\n\n(30:35) they took over the Babylonian religion but the priesthood revolted against peram against the mid Persia and so the priesthood was driven out and the priesthood established itself here at this city so here was the official ancient Babylonian priesthood interesting they took the Palladium Stone the vestments which were the\n\n(31:00) vestments of Dagon they had a fish robe and they had a fish miter with an open mouth on their head very interesting CU they represented Dagon the god of the fish and he was called pontifex maximos the bridge between Heaven and Earth so you were saved by man and's mediation the mediation of the church\n\n(31:32) rather than the mediation of Christ so he was the bridge between Heaven and Earth the keys and the miter with them so he had keys two keys the key to heaven and the key to Hell interesting and they were called pontiff Kings of pergamum and the last one was at Talos III now he became a Christian uh no not aalos yet later they became\n\n(32:01) Christians but aalos III when he realized that Rome was going to take them by force he bequeathed his title to the Roman Emperor so if you go to Rome today you will see behind the Roman emperors the letters PM pontifex maximos bridge builder and the Roman Emperor as we saw were Gods so you could pray to\n\n(32:24) them they were the one who opened heaven for you now it's interesting that you will find those same letters PM not only behind the names of the Roman emperors but you'll also find them behind the names of whom the popes you will find PM pontifex Maximo so this title came down in history through the Roman emperors and\n\n(32:52) eventually also to the pontiffs of Rome who by the way also Al have the two keys which they refer to as the keys of Peter and they have the same vestments with a miter that represents ton how did that come into the Christian church now in ad. 378 the Christian Emperor gratian refused the title so here were the Roman\n\n(33:22) emperors and here's one who said no I don't want this title so it lay vacant until it was seized by Damascus the bishop of Rome and this is how the title came to be part and parcel of the Roman pontiff so we still have the title today but what happened here at peramos well this was the time when this\n\n(33:47) compromise came in now at pagamos you have this great great peramos uh altar which was of course the altar to the gods all the gods of the pantheon tremendous battle is depicted here between the forces of good and the forces of evil and Revelation 2 12: 12 to 14 say to the angel of the Church of pergamos right these things says he\n\n(34:19) which has the sh sharp sword with the two Edge that's the word of God Jesus is writing about the word of God and here is another another one who also has a sword but he is an Earthly mediation I Know Thy works and where thou dwellest he's talking to his church remember they're dwelling where where Satan's seat is wow so this\n\n(34:46) priesthood which supposes to be another Babel portal to God is an abomination of Satan Satan's cities and thou holdest fast my name so this church still held to the truth in the midst of these circumstances and has not denied my faith even in the days when antias a very interesting name my faithful Mar who was slain\n\n(35:15) amongst you where Satan dwelleth second time that it says that so here was someone who was preferred we prefer to die rather than give up his faith and he calls him Antipas now Antipas could be some say a historic figure and some say it is this one or that one or whatever um pastor of that church was faithful at that time but the\n\n(35:40) word antias also means unti pontiff so it could be spiritual that this individual who claimed to be the one who mediated for you between God and man and so mediation had moved moved from God Christ to man that he was a problem and people were commended for being antias but I have a few things against\n\n(36:11) thee here's a reproof because th Hast there in them that hold to the doctrine of balum MH who taught baac to cast the stumbling block before the children of Israel and to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication so something had been sneaking into the church here because there are those that\n\n(36:32) hold to the doctrine of balum now we've discussed that what was the doctrine of balum compromise get them to sin get them to break the law of God and then we'll have them so here is a compromise coming in where there is a Doctrine being taught which will lead the people astray and they will stop start serving other\n\n(37:00) gods and that's what's going to happen to the Christian church God is warning here watch it compromise is going to come Constantine did this Constantine said let's marry the churches let's not have this constant battle between Christianity and paganism let's marry them so he issued a medallion on which\n\n(37:22) on the one side he serves Jesus Christ and on the other side he has his Pagan deities but he had a problem Constantine had a problem you know what that was the word of God Constantine had a problem with the word of God because the word of God cut like a double-edged sword and so what did he do he said\n\n(37:50) let's compromise I'm going to give a whole lecture on this and he got his priest you see to rewrite portions of the Bible and he sent them out and 50 copies were made and they were written so that Jesus Christ would become less than what he was so that there could be a marriage between the religions and zoroa could\n\n(38:18) stand next to Jesus Christ and Zas could stand next to Jesus Christ and Apollo could stand next to Jesus Christ and everything would be honky Dory we can worship them both it was an ecumenical document that he commissioned so a compromise came in and Jesus had to become less and obedience to God was replaced by obedience to man\n\n(38:48) problem doctrine of balum so Hast th also them that hold to the doctrine of the nians oops first they hated the doctrine of the nians now they held to the doctrine repent or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he that has an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto\n\n(39:10) the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the Hidden mana and will give him a white stone and a stone a new name written which no man knoweth saying saving he that receiveth it compromise is the greatest evil of all because it is so deceptive it is so deceptive here is this great City these are the people\n\n(39:38) that live there today the marketplace it is still third world the red wall of the outer wall the Temple of dianosis the Temple of Trojan the Temple of Zas there is a well that Kaiser vam made because he took everything away and carried way Scholastica and scapus that was the worship that came in in paramos\n\n(40:07) compromise I would like to recommend today that compromise between error and Truth be rejected and Jesus and his truth be made Eternal in the heart so the next time period mentioned is tathra a. 538 probably to 1517 it has many meanings this name it means sweet Savor of Labor it means sacrifice of Contrition and some say that it also\n\n(40:42) means Satan's teachings so after the compromise came in and clearly we see that balam's tech technology was used nications were acceptable whereas the early church rejected that teaching here we have a time period of Darkness 538 ad probably the Justinian decree went out to appoint the bishop of Rome as the\n\n(41:12) corrector of Heretics so now the word was no longer the component which decided right from wrong but a human individual had taken the wrong of deciding for you what you should believe that's a problem wouldn't you agree if God created us free agents and we individually have to stand before God one day and give an\n\n(41:41) account for what we have done and what we have believed can we then say Oh but he decided for me yes or no no what happened when Adam and Eve sinned what's the first thing they did blamed someone right yes when God said to Adam what have you done what did Adam say woo the woman you gave me was her fault and when he looked at the woman\n\n(42:13) what did she say oh it was a serpent that beguiled me you remember that so once we start getting into that mode we start blaming someone else you know we are living in a blame lame society today have you noticed that nobody has a problem on this planet no child has a problem on the planet I have my problems because of my parents\n\n(42:41) so here was now a corrector of Heretics here was someone who decided for you what you had to believe and if you didn't do it his way what happened to you Sizzle fits that was the end of you so it must be this time period when Man became the standard for everyone else it's called the Dark Ages once you reject\n\n(43:12) light and you assume to be light that's when you have Darkness if the Son of God is not the light of the world and someone else becomes the light of the world then you have Darkness there's just no other way so htz Houser who is a Roman Catholic Theologian says it is the Church of the Middle Ages now\n\n(43:38) in this particular City you had a temple of Apollo that's the Sun God and you had an altar to a female goddess the Church of the Middle Ages had a God and they had deified a female we'll come to that later in the lectures there was a textile industry in this particular City where they made dyes purple and Crimson dyes made from a\n\n(44:06) root known as M root now the colors purple and Crimson are also the colors of the Church of the Middle Ages very interesting and the colors have very particular meaning purple is the color of royalty Crimson is the color of sacrifice so they they have assumed the position of royalty and sacrifice which\n\n(44:31) should acre to none other than Jesus Christ they have set themselves up as the norm they are the ones who forgive sins they are the ones who says come unto me and I will give you rest come unto me confess your sins to me and I will give you Absolution whereas Jesus says I am the way the truth and the life\n\n(44:51) confess your sins to God so here here was a problem coming in then in this story as it unfolds in the city there's a story of Jezebel now if you look in the Old Testament Jezebel was the princess of Phoenicia who married Ahab who was the king of Israel and led the whole of Israel into sun worship you can read the\n\n(45:16) story there in 1 Kings 18:4 2 Kings 9:22 Jezebel led the people of God into Baal worship and you had in that time if you read the story you had Priests of Baal and you had Priests of ashet now ashet was the female deity that was worshiped so you had a male deity and a female deity this is interesting and you could pray to either\n\n(45:49) and you had Priests of the one and Priests of the other now the Church of the Middle Ages did exactly the same thing you have an entire priesthood dedicated to Mary and you have a priesthood dedicated to a male deity it's interesting I Know Thy works and charity love and service and Faith remember that\n\n(46:17) the letter is written to God's Church living in those circumstances and sometimes drinking from that Fountain that's the sad had part about it and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first so here's Works orientation now let me not get this wrong there's nothing wrong with works\n\n(46:40) because faith without works is dead but if Works take the place of Faith then your faith is dead are you with me so here was a church that shifted the emphasis from Faith to works not withstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that means tolerates that woman Jezebel now there might have been a\n\n(47:11) literal Jezebel there they say that in that time period there was she was the woman who was in control of the textile industry who made the purple and the Crimson uh dyed cloths but obviously the Bible is using something literally what was then and applies it in a future application and applies it to this great\n\n(47:35) apostasy which happened when Ahab who was king of Israel married Jezebel in other words he went into a relationship with paganism is that clear and here is this king who marries into paganism so the Church of God accepts paganism and intermingles it into its very fiber so they suffer this woman they\n\n(48:09) tolerate Jezebel which calls herself a prophetes now to prophesy means to preach it also means to receive visions and you have to take from the context which one you're dealing with obviously here they're preaching to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication to become unfaithful to God and to serve other\n\n(48:37) gods and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols wow that's getting pretty specific idolatry and eating and drinking becomes part of the idolatry now God had always warned his people not to eat food sacrificed to idols and here was a specific idolatry it's interesting that the Pagan deities Backus zus Osiris were worshiped with\n\n(49:12) round wafer round breads symbolizing their bodies literal bodies did that come into the church system at this time well well it did and I gave her space to repent of her fornication God gave her time lots of time to repent but the sad story is she repented not and behold I will cast her onto a bed and them that commit adultery with\n\n(49:47) her into Great Tribulation except they repent of their deeds but they won't repent so the system won't change it will remain so God will have to take this light give it to something else because this system is not going to repent it's a problematic system and I will kill her children with death so out of the system there will\n\n(50:15) even be children who will be as apostate as she was and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the rain and hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your works so if works is your Criterium I will judge you by your works if you lead people into idolatry I will judge you by\n\n(50:40) that but unto you I say unto the rest in th as many as have not this Doctrine so not everybody followed there came a great split in the church and which have not known the depth of Satan now this is interesting technology to know the depths of Satan means that you must be initiated into the secrets of\n\n(51:11) occultism is that right there are people today who claim to know the depths of occultism and we'll have to find out where this depth of occultism is seated today and we're going to do this in the lectures that come in no UNC terms but here it is seated in which church the church of the Middle Ages knows the depths of Satan Wow that's\n\n(51:44) scary we're going to have to deal with this as they speak I will put upon you none other burden so there are people that resist this compromise that resist this inner teaching this mystery this occultism but that which you have already hold fast till I come here's the first reference to the coming of Christ\n\n(52:11) so obviously we've moved from a time period when the church knew what truth was became complacent moved to a time when there was great persecution and the church was cleansed smna then a period of compromise paramos when truth and error became intermingled to a time period when man sets himself up as standard to decide\n\n(52:43) right and wrong and becomes religion for you rather than the word and then we get into pure occultism hold fast till I come he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto the end to him will I give power over the Nations well here is the Justinian uh pillar there it is this one over here commemorating the decree that\n\n(53:16) man can now decide who is on the right side and not and has the right to punish him even to death pillars are brought in Egyptian Pillars these are symbols phallic symbols of airus this is paganism you will find them particularly in Rome of course right in the center in the Vatican you will find this tremendous pillar of uh T\n\n(53:48) Moses III the very pharaoh of The Exodus the Triple Crown which is from Meo Persia represents actually God Of Heaven the earth and the Nether world wow that's quite something to be crowned with a crown that makes you King Of Heaven Earth and the Nether world that's taking the place of someone else well obviously we need some\n\n(54:15) renewal the Church of the Middle Ages became darkness and it was known as the Dark Ages so the next time period is Sardis a. 1517 to 1798 it means renewal the time periods we will come to later as to why these particular time periods are relevant renewal that which remains literally sdus means Reformation then\n\n(54:45) isn't that incredible that God should have this in this sequence the city was impregnable but was taken twice without resistance once by isiris was king of Meo Persia and Antiochus Greek King Antiochus the great let's read about this Reformation period Revelation 3:1 unto the angel of the Church of sardus WR these things\n\n(55:13) says he that has the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars the teachers in his hands I Know Thy works that thou Hast name that thou livest and are dead wow here was a renewal here was New Life in the church something had been discovered idolatry had been set aside and there was life but this life was not\n\n(55:41) complete enough to make it life there was death in It Be watchful strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die this is a terrible testimony so here was Life coming and there were things that had to be restored that were dead that were now have to be restored to life but they're ready to die\n\n(56:08) doctrines teachings for I have not found thy works perfect complete before God so obviously the Reformation although it breathed new life into the doctrine of Christ did not have perfect works it was not complete something was left undone it's very interesting that at the Council of Trent there was a major major issue and\n\n(56:37) we'll be discussing this a little bit later in the lectures the major issue was solar scriptura the Bible and the Bible alone as standard Rome said no Bible and and tradition and tradition is the context in which the word must be evaluated so tradition man is the one who supersedes and controls the issues of the Bible\n\n(57:13) that was the position of Rome and man was the one who determined how it should be read so the church decides what's right and wrong for you not the word the Reformation said no solar scrip Sol graia saved by grace and grace alone saved by Jesus Christ and the word is the standard whereby we live that was\n\n(57:39) the issue who won at the Council of Trent good question Rome one the Reformation lost at the Council of Trent sad I'll show it to you in a future lecture the Reformation lost a split came yes a split came but the Reformation lost they had the greatest opportunity in the history of the world to complete the\n\n(58:10) works and to win but they lost why because Rome could prove that their Traditions superseded the word the Reformation wasn't doing what it was preaching the Reformation had said Sol script the word and the word alone and then the church asked do you keep all the teachings why do you follow Rome in some issues and\n\n(58:41) leave the Bible alone why did you set it aside a cardinal got up and made a speech I'll come through it in the future lecture and say why are you accepting our tradition over the word you are are transgressing your own precepts you mean nothing you are just a rebellion and the Reformation lost on that issue it wasn't perfect before God\n\n(59:10) sad story remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee that's a sad story too if you reject light sooner or later you won't be able to discern the time you\n\n(59:31) are living in and the coming of Christ will be a total surprise thou Hast a few names even in sardus which have not defiled their garments so all was not wrong with the Reformation the Reformation was a wonderful powerful tool it just didn't finish the job it didn't go all the way the work was not complete before God and\n\n(59:58) they shall walk with me in white I wonder who they are could it be yanus could it be Tindle could it be whitecliffe could it be Martin Luther could it be all those great reformers they are worthy they stood for what they understood to be truth he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot his name\n\n(1:00:21) out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels by the way this is an interesting text it doesn't say there I will write his name in The Book of Life it says I will not blot his name out of The Book of Life wow what's I tell you about God how many people does God want to be\n\n(1:00:46) saved everybody did you know that every person ever born was written in the Book of Life and he his choice decides whether he stays there or goes sad story anyway this is Sardis what it looked like that's all that's left for him this is a Muslim lady that accompanied us on that tour wonderful uh story she accepted\n\n(1:01:22) Christianity and uh had to run for her life as a consequ quence anyway here's an old Byzantine Church covered in a farm is in it this is an old synagogue that has been opened up over here and cleaned out this is probably where Paul Tau and uh maybe Paul was in the synagogue ins s this if we go into history well this is the city of\n\n(1:01:54) Prague and uh today pretty industrial but the ancient city is very very beautiful one of the most beautifully preserved old cities in Europe very very impressive this is where yanus preached and here's a statue in his memory in front of these old buildings and here is a song which they sang now I can't read uh this Czech\n\n(1:02:25) language over here but in any case this song is against the king of Babylon wow this Hite Yan hus preached against the king of Babylon and he preached that this king of Babylon was taking the place of Jesus Christ and hos was declared a heretic and sentenced to death at the stake thou Hast a few names even in\n\n(1:02:57) sardus which are not def have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy here's the old bridge over the river in Prague and here they used to hang the body parts of the hites who rejected the teachings of Rome and chose the teachings of the Bible so if they were caught then they cut off pieces and\n\n(1:03:24) they hung them here for all to see so you'd have a corpse hanging there an arm a leg a head dangling to remind you that it was not worth your while to go contrary to the teachings of the Church of the Middle Ages as you cross this bridge today you will find the Pagan Saints there back in their place here's a lady\n\n(1:03:47) putting a hand on this image you can see how this bronze image over here is shiny for from all the people who put their hands there because they believe if they put their hands there they will receive a special blessing this is a a Catholic saint who apparently died here by being dangling dangled over the bridge\n\n(1:04:08) actually was pulled up so they say and if you put your hand there you receive a special blessing so now you can receive a blessing through the activities of man that's what the hites were fighting against man's elevation over Christ symbols of sun worship uh the signs of the zodiac here is a Jesuit Enclave over\n\n(1:04:33) there with the letters IHS Isis Horus set the Egyptian Trinity the churches are being modified here's a health resort where you can buy some healthy foods there is Martin Luther and here on this very stairway which is called la Santa Scala Martin Luther got up from his knees and said the just shall live by faith you see\n\n(1:05:04) this stairway it is claimed was the stairway where Christ walked when he was sentenced to death by pilate and then one night miraculously the Angels took the stairway from Jerusalem and plunked it down in Rome that's how it got to be there and then they built this Cathedral around it and today if you go up on it\n\n(1:05:24) on your knees you can receive a special blessing and 90 days Absolution you can still get it today that means for 90 days you can do whatever you like and be forgiven ahead of time I looked at these young people and old people crawling up here trying to find forgiveness for whatever it is they had done or wished to do isn't that\n\n(1:05:49) sad when all you have to do is look at Jesus and say Here I Am Lord I am a sinner forgive me and Jesus will look down and says I do not condemn you go and sin no more what a wonderful way of finding forgiveness Fortin Lu he stood before the emperor and the kingdom Maron Luther and he said here I stand I can do no other I whether it's\n\n(1:06:25) the word or it's not the word by the way Martin Luther realized even where his Works were not complete but he couldn't do everything his followers should have followed on but they did not and there he stood and well that's history the work was not completed and so what happened because Martin Luther couldn't complete\n\n(1:06:49) the work another Christian denomination Rose and said hey Martin you missed out on something and they started a new denomination and they followed the new leader who was maybe called whatever Calvin and they called themselves Calvinists and then someone else discovered hey Calvin and Martin you did not realize that the Bible teaches\n\n(1:07:12) something else over here you know and then you have the Baptists and they have some more information and they had it and the Lutheran say well Martin didn't see that so neither do we and the Calvinists say well we didn't see that either so we're not going to follow that route and then you have White Cliff\n\n(1:07:34) saying whoa you know here's something great here that we've discovered in the Bible come Protestant fellows let's do this hey no you better do it on your own form your own denomination and so what happened have all these Christian denominations each with their doctrines which are based on the Bible but each\n\n(1:07:58) claiming to have something other from the other that keeps them separate don't we all have the same Bible yes or no don't we all have the same truth if we have one Bible yes or no and why so many denominations can't we find out what the truth is and do it well then comes Philadelphia 1798 to 1844 Philadelphia means Brotherly Love\n\n(1:08:22) atalis II built it because he loved his brother IM emenus and it was a Gateway through the mountains it was an Open Door well this is an interesting time because after the Reformation had been completed that's when w Mission started Carrie went to India 1793 Morrison to China 187 mafa to Africa 1817 British\n\n(1:08:48) Bible Society started in 1804 American Bible Society 1816 the word went to the world to the angel of the church in Philadelphia Brotherly Love write these things says he that is Holy he that is true he that has the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth interesting\n\n(1:09:11) concept something's opening up and something's closing down so God opens the way for World Mission and it goes up but there's also something else that's opening and closing here there were Gates doors if you like between the compartments of the sanctuary and when we come into the next time period we\n\n(1:09:31) will find that we are no longer in the Holy but in the most holy H so Jesus's Ministry must have shifted from the holy to the most holy but that's another concept that we won't deal with in detail Now I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou Hast little\n\n(1:09:55) little strength small group and has kept my word and has not denied my name there's no reproof here a small group decides they will follow Christ in everything all truth behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan so there are Satan's Church on the world which say they are Jews Christians and are not\n\n(1:10:24) but do like I behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee so here is a group that finds truth and something is being restored because thou Hast kept the word of my patience back to the word so obviously something is being done differently I also will keep thee from the hour of\n\n(1:10:51) Temptation so they won't be here right at the end so it's a period just before the last groups on Earth which shall come upon the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth behold I come quickly what did he said in the previous church I coming soon now I come quickly you see that time is shorter now so obviously we've\n\n(1:11:17) moved in history through time from a time when he's coming soon when his coming is not mentioned to a time when he's coming soon to a time now where he's coming quickly this is before the last events but this group will not go into the final events because they'll be kept from the hour of Temptation hold fast\n\n(1:11:42) that which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown Revelation 39-11 what happened in history well if you go to Philadelphia you'll find few ruins of some bantine churches there it's very Middle Ages and uh this old lady has an interesting connotation for me she taught me an interesting lesson she gave a big hug and a kiss to a lady that was\n\n(1:12:12) very sad who was being marginalized by everyone else and gave me a stern look of rebuke and uh I remember that look because it's taught me something it taught me that I must regard people as of more value than what they do but uh that's a different story for another time him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God\n\n(1:12:42) tremendous be part of the sav and he shall go no more out eternal life and I will write upon him the name of my God God's character will be in him and the name of the city of of my God the character of my people which is New Jerusalem which cometh down from heaven note not a city with bad sewage down\n\n(1:13:05) here on Earth no it comes down from heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name Revelation 3:12 these are great promises to this church so Philadelphia a time of renewal when the teachings of the Bible were taken in their fullness again and combined into one teaching following everything in the Bible the Bible also\n\n(1:13:32) went into the whole world with Satan there trying to confuse the issue and God's people supposedly there to represent righteousness and truth and then comes the last Church loud and if we take the prophecy of Daniel where the 2000 300 day prophecy ends with uh this interesting date 1844 we'll have a whole lecture on it so\n\n(1:14:03) let's not get into that gets too complicated laia means nation of judgment so that means the last one this is a anti-typical if you like yon kipu Christ is in the most holy now because we've moved from candlesticks and show Breads and altars of incense to Ark of the Covenant so he's moved into the next phase a yur\n\n(1:14:28) a time of judgment very interesting now this city Antiochus built it and named it after his wife laia she was lauis it was a health resort they had I solve that they made very famous one which was called cerium so they were there to give spiritual eyesight if you like was a very wealthy City was destroyed in ad60 by by an\n\n(1:14:55) earthquake rebuilt with own funds no State funds they were wealthy they had it all and they had a health Resorts those are the ruins of L some of it is still being dug up here has an old Amphitheater that's not being excavated yet and they had this fascinating system here's an old pipe system notice all this insulation around\n\n(1:15:18) these pipes tremendous stuff they put all these pipes into this these heavy um systems and piped the water to this town now not too far away there are hot Wells but there were none in ludia so they piped it here and the water went in hot and the wonderful feet of engineering when it came out at ler the water was no\n\n(1:15:44) longer hot it was lukewarm if you drank it lukewarm you got nauseous and you threw up if you made it hot you could drink it you know like tea you could drink it if you made an ice cold you could also get it down so like today where you have these salt cures and you drink these Waters you could get it down but as it arrived\n\n(1:16:07) there it was lukewarm fascinating story in archaeology I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot ha I would that thou W cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth Revelation 3:15 and 16 notice that the rebuke is not I will come and take your Candlestick and give\n\n(1:16:35) it to someone else the rebuke is I will spit you out H you see this is the last Church on Earth there's no taking away of the Candlestick there's only a spitting out so this church goes through to the kingdom but those that are lukewarm will have to be spat out of it this church will be shaken and those that do not conform\n\n(1:17:13) will be shaken up so is this a perfect Church yes or no no it's pathetic notice that it is luk w and that there is no Commendation only a rebuke no Commendation whatsoever it's the only one that has no Commendation nothing not too far away this heropolis where or they really hot springs but there it was lukewarm today many many\n\n(1:17:45) Health Resorts with all these beautiful calcium carbonate deposits and all these little hot Wells down there are all over the place it's a very beautiful place they still make healthy food there as well amphitheaters this camel I think needs a tooth job because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of\n\n(1:18:11) nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched miserable poor blind naked wow this church is in trouble here's a little boy Gathering gabber it's a little uh substance that is used in the health industry to take pain away it's like an anesthetic so even today this area is known for its Health herbs you see there\n\n(1:18:39) is a health message associated with laa something for the physical body but unfortunately they are rich now is God interested in literal riches yes or no no so in what are they Rich spiritual yes they have biblical knowledge they have biblical knowledge you see the Reformation had not completed the job the Reformation became\n\n(1:19:15) fragmented because of an uncomplete job then Philadelphia time period came along and a consolidation took place and the word was again unraveled in all its fullness and laia inherited the knowledge here they were they had the knowledge and what did they do with it sit on it and what do they do they become rich\n\n(1:19:45) and increased in goods and have need of nothing they start playing Church the church is supposed to be the light of the world but these people play church and they do not know that they are wretched and miserable and poor spiritually poor and blind they don't have discernment and they are naked they\n\n(1:20:15) are devoid of Christ you see faith without works is dead whereas Works does doesn't earn you any brownie points because you are saved by grace and grace alone if you do not share that which you know well then you have a problem and if you are rich if you believe that you have the truth well then why share it with\n\n(1:20:43) someone else make might make you uncomfortable and there are people that might believe that they have the truth and that the truth will save them the Jews believed that and they had the truth but they rejected the Messiah and nailed him to a cross didn't they do that so to have the truth doesn't save\n\n(1:21:06) you to have Jesus Christ saves you and if you have Jesus Christ you will go out and you will not condemn those who know not the truth you will love those who know not the truth and try and win them over to the truth because Jesus died for you and for me while we were yet sinners right or wrong and that's\n\n(1:21:31) the way it's going to be and let me tell you something nobody and I'm going to say this very harshly nobody is saved by his right understanding of any Doctrine have you got that if you have the perfect knowledge on how to be saved is that going to save you no if you sit on it and you have it and you're riched and increased in Goods\n\n(1:21:58) that's not going to save you applying it to the heart and making Jesus the center and the Alpha and the Omega of your life that is saving knowledge with works but to sit on it won't save you now if you become so riched and increased in Goods that you start arguing on this issue and that issue and I have the perfect\n\n(1:22:28) understanding of this Doctrine and therefore I am right and you are wrong and you are lost and I'm save this church is so full of knowledge that it has time to debate the issue round and round like a dog with its mouth and its tail running round and round in circles and getting nowhere this church is wretched and\n\n(1:22:49) miserable so if you're looking for the perfect end time Church you will not find it you have to look for one that's miserable and poor and blind and wretched then you might have found it how's that I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rayment that thou\n\n(1:23:11) mayest be clothed so how do you get rich and how do you get the Robes of righteousness and how do you cover the shame of your nakedness and how do you get spiritual discernment and I solve so that you can see as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent so if you want to do what is\n\n(1:23:35) right God will put you in the fire of Affliction so I have bad news anybody who finds this truth it's hot and you will have to take care of yourself and eat G here there's a knocking on the door and here there is a beautiful field ready for the Harvest I took this standing on my knees taking it across\n\n(1:24:06) behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and the open the door I will come into him God doesn't Force anyone and I will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh there's some overcoming to be done will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I am sat down\n\n(1:24:25) with my father in his throne Revelation 3:20 that's the history of the church finally I have to tell you that there are people on this Earth who have a knowledge of the truth but they're not very well known for spreading it they're rather well known for sitting on it and arguing amongst themselves as to\n\n(1:24:49) the particulars of each particular point and as to their perfection or non perfection in this issue or that that's not the issue Jesus is the issue truth is important but only if it is applied to the hearts and I pray that we all may understand and gain a knowledge of the truth but that we far more lest we\n\n(1:25:16) become clanging symbols find Jesus and apply him to our hearts in the next lectures we will find out how truth has been thrown to the ground on this planet and what trouble we are really in and who controls what and how they do it may God bless you and keep you and come to the next lectures as we unfold the whole battle between\n\n(1:25:44) good and evil thank you for coming [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

  "# Title:208_seven_seals_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSeven Seals Prophecy,Heavenly Throne Room,Four Horsemen,Gospel Truths,God's Authority\n\n## Guide:\nThis source unpacks the symbolic narrative of the Seven Seals from the Book of Revelation, contextualizing them within a broader prophetic view. It begins by establishing the majesty and control of God in the heavenly throne room, emphasizing His role as the ultimate judge before delving into earthly events. The core of the explanation then focuses on the first five seals, which are presented as a chronological recounting of the Christian church's historical trajectory, from its initial purity (white horse), through periods of intense persecution (red horse), the introduction of compromise and scarcity of truth (black horse), and ultimately a time of widespread spiritual death and persecution by state power (pale horse). Finally, the fifth seal is described as the cries of martyrs throughout history for justice, leading into the anticipation of the sixth and seventh seals, which signify a time of celestial signs, a reawakening to biblical prophecy, and the ultimate triumph of Christ.\n\n## Content:\n(2) Total Onslaught 208 Seven Seals Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv_7vCRI4Ss\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] tonight we're going to talk about the seven seals and then we're going to have another talk on the seven trumpets and these are thunderous issues now the seven seals are dealt with mainly in Chapter six but to set the stage for the seven seals there are two other chapters\n\n(01:26) chapters four and five and of course it is important to remember that the chapters themselves say nothing because the numbers in the Bible were added afterwards the Bible wasn't written like that the Bible was written as a block so you cannot really divide it up into the numbers the numbers are just convenient\n\n(01:45) for finding where you are and how to find a particular text the lamb opened one of the seals now before he opens the seals to tell us what will happen on this earth he first gives us a view of the great throne room in heaven one of the most picturesque views of the throne room of the universe just imagine having\n\n(02:10) a look into that tremendous seat of power revelation 4 verse 1 after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show you things which must be Hereafter so you have the prophetic view and\n\n(02:34) immediately I was taken in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurers up until i selves roth's against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus\n\n(02:59) Christ according to my gospel Romans 2 verse 5 and 16 what is it good with the great throne room well the great throne room is the seat of the king of the universe and that king of the universe is also the judge of the universe so before God permits us to look into what is going to happen on this earth and to look at the apostasy\n\n(03:23) that will come and the terrible things that men will do he gives us a view of his majesty and his power and he gives us the view that in spite of the fact that it looks as if the other side is winning he is in control and finally he will be the judge and there will come a judgement so there will be a judgment and investigation a\n\n(03:54) pronouncement of judgment and then will come an executive judgment and when that executive judgment comes we better be on the right side for you must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that every one may receive the things done in his body 2 Corinthians 5:10 make no mistake Jesus is in control God is in control at\n\n(04:24) 17 verse 31 because he has the point of the day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained we're obvious given assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead make no mistake Jesus will one day put an end to serve revelation 4 verse 3 and he that said was to look\n\n(04:52) upon like a yes / and a sodden stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in the sight like unto an emerald it is inexplicable to explain the glory that john sees here in the throne room of God and around about the throne were four and 20 seats 24 seats around the throne and upon the seats I saw\n\n(05:17) four and 20 elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold so here are 24 individuals sitting around the throne of God and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunders and voices he cannot even explain the glory that he sees he just sees flashes of light and\n\n(05:40) the voice of God like thunder and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God now we explained this before God is one there is one spirit but the seven represents the time periods as we went through them God is in control in all ages including the one we are living in now\n\n(06:07) now who are these twenty-four elders now in the earthly sanctuary there were also 24 elders and we read about it in the book of chronicles chapter 24 verse 7 and it tells us the lot fell and came forth to Europe and second to Judea and then it goes through them all the third and the fourth and the fifth and the\n\n(06:29) sixth and the seventh and it tells us who these elders were that were chosen and it details every single one right through down to verse 19 and 23 24 elders these were the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the Lord according to their manner under Aaron their father as the Lord God\n\n(06:55) of Israel had commanded him so in the earthly sanctuary there were 24 elders that officiated with the high priest who was error so if the earthly was a type of the heavenly then he heavenly there are 24 elders who officiate with the high priest who is Jesus in the heavenly sanctuary would be interesting to know who they are but of\n\n(07:20) course we are not told who they are but we can speculate some revelations 4:6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass he just sees this magnificent light that you could walk on like under crystals and in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before him behind\n\n(07:44) now who are they and the first beast was like a lion and the second like a calf and the third beast had the face of a man and the fourth beast like a flying eagle and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord\n\n(08:11) God Almighty which was and he's in his two-car interesting statement so who are they well in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 2 we have another statement that can help us it says above it stood the seraphim's each one had six wings with twain with two he covered his face and with twain two he covered his feet and with twain\n\n(08:36) he did fly so we're talking about cherubims these are an order of angelic beings there was so magnificent and so imposing and they looked so powerful that John describes them as beasts and he gives them the attributes of the lion and the calf and the man and the flying but you can see with what reverence they\n\n(09:01) stand before God gives you an idea of the holiness of God now who do they represent well the traditional view is that the lion stands for strength the calf stands for endurance the man for intelligence and the flying eagle for swiftness so they can see all things around them they're aware of all things and they are\n\n(09:27) the ones closest to God covering cherubs if you like another view is that they reflect the attributes of Christ you see the lion is a symbol of a king and Jesus is the king the calf or the heifer is the one that serves that pulls the plough if you like and so it is a symbol of Christ the servant the\n\n(09:58) man he has the appearance of a man Christ became man for us so it represents his humanity and the flying eagle in the scriptures is used as a symbol of divinity Jesus says I will lift you up as an eagle under the wings you will be so it's a symbol of divinity it's interesting that the Arcot world uses these four symbols also for its\n\n(10:27) deity so if Satan was the covering cherub and he is now a fallen angel then he wanted to be like the Most High then it's interesting that these are the attributes which he claims for himself as well so you see if you see symbols sometimes we freak about all the symbols but many of them are actually drawn from\n\n(10:53) the scriptures and Satan is counterfeiting them to his own purposes but in the throne room of God you see the Lamb of God he is king he is servant he is human he became man for us but he is divine that would be the symbolism and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the\n\n(11:19) throne who liveth for ever and ever the four twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship Him very interesting that liveth for ever and ever and cause death crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure\n\n(11:47) they are and were created now the Bible is very clear as to who the Creator is all things were created by the word of Jesus Christ says the Bible but we will deal with that in another lecture and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals\n\n(12:15) chapter 5 verse 1 and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals there are and no man in heaven so there are some people in heaven nor indya's neither under the earth so none of the Dead either would have qualified no matter how good they were whether\n\n(12:39) they were Abraham's or whether they were King David's or whether they were Adam himself none of them qualified was open able to open the book neither to look thereon so who were these people that he saw in heaven the cherubs we can understand they were angels but the 24 elders well the Bible says that when\n\n(13:05) Jesus rose from the dead the graves were opened isn't that right and the first fruits rose from the dead and the Bible says when he entered into heaven when he ascended into heaven he took captives in his training isn't that right so people that had been redeemed throughout the ages were raised from the dead at that\n\n(13:29) stage and went with him to heaven the Bible also tells us that there are some other individuals in heaven Enoch for example was translated without seeing death and was taken up into heaven isn't right Elijah as a representative of those who will be translated after the flood was also taken up by the chariots\n\n(13:57) of God into heaven isn't that right so Elijah is there and then there's an interesting version in Judah where Michael argues with Satan over the body of Moses so Moses had a special resurrection and was taken up into heaven and that is why Elijah and Moses could appear on the Mount of Transfiguration and support\n\n(14:26) Christ in the time of his agony before he went through the episodes that confronted him in his final hours so they are a number of individuals in heaven and of those obviously there are 24 that serve in the heavenly century as the 24 elders who exactly who we do not know we could speculate that Moses might be one of them nor that\n\n(14:58) Elijah and Enoch but the other names we just don't have them we'll see one day we'll find out who they were but the interesting story so the earthly a type of the heavenly but no man was worthy to open the seals whether he was worthy enough in the eyes of God to have been taken up into heaven made no difference of course no man in\n\n(15:25) heaven and no man on earth and no man under the earth that had ever lived would have been worthy to open the seals but fortunately there is a solution revelation 5 verse 4 and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon now this document was sealed\n\n(15:49) with seven seals in the old days they used to seal in Roman times a testament a last will and testament with and seals and of course if that is not open then there is no inheritance so if the seventh sealed book is not open there is no inheritance and we are forever lost that is why he wept but if they could be opened and the will be\n\n(16:16) read and there be an execution of the world then we could be redeemed and there is only one who left a will and testament and lives in order to receive it because normally when you die and you leave a will and testament you have to depend on someone else to open it isn't that right and to execute it and if the\n\n(16:45) only one who can inherit it is the one who died well then you have a problem because the one whose daddy's dead and Conda narrated anymore unless of course he is God and has been resurrected through his own power Wow and so we find that one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David has\n\n(17:09) prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof so all is not lost the god man is there and I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne so what does that make him if he's in the midst of the throne well then he's sitting in the seat of deity and of the four beasts and in the midst of the\n\n(17:40) elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns horn the seat of power kingship over all the ages he is a king if you look in the Book of Daniel you'll see that a horn stands for a king or a kingdom and seven eyes he sees throughout the ages which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the\n\n(18:07) earth not part of it there are seven and came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of the\n\n(18:27) saints so the prayers of the saints are represented as incense and the merit of Christ's make the prayers acceptable to God wonderful imagery that we have here and heavenly music fools the throne room as they worship the lamb and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof\n\n(18:54) for thou wast near as the answer slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood so these four and twenty elders that are saying this were they humans or were they angels they must have been humans why because they are redeemed that's right so we know that there are humans in heaven right now who were redeemed\n\n(19:24) and the ones that are in heaven are those that went up in the first fruits as we said and the three that we know are that the Bible mentions that were translated or had a special resurrection for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation that\n\n(19:49) gets rid of all exclusivity so there are some that believe today that salvation is by birth have you noticed that there are people like that people who believe in salvation by birth they say I belong to the right race or I belong to the right ethnic group therefore I am saved the Jews had that particular theology\n\n(20:15) and there are many groups in the world today that they who believe that they are saved as a consequence of their particular stature there are many interesting beliefs up there salvation by name salvation by hat but I won't get into that so he's the one that redeems us by his blood out of every kindred tongue\n\n(20:43) and people and nation lest we should boast that one is better than another and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth fascinating text we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels around about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the\n\n(21:10) number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands so we're dealing with billions here saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing so you have this tremendous view of the scene in heaven\n\n(21:33) showing that the final victor is going to be who Jesus Christ so we have nothing to fear it's interesting that God gives us this view and then he shifts the emphasis to tell us what's going to happen on this earth and the two I in such contrast with each other that it's scary scary and one might believe that Christianity is the loser\n\n(22:02) on this issue did you know that the greatest apparent victory for Satan was his greatest defeat when he had Jesus nailed to that cross and he was triumphing in his power and glory he actually sounded his death knell and so it will be with the whole Christian Church the greatest apparent defeat will be turned by the merits of Jesus Christ\n\n(22:36) into the greatest victory that the universe has ever seen make no mistake Jesus is in control and when we go through the next lectures remember those words because there are going to be some scary things we're going to talk about but we can whistle and smile and sing hymns because we know the outcome already and every creature\n\n(23:02) which is in heaven and on earth and under the earth and such as though in the sea that's a symbol of the nations and all that are in them heard I sang blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that citizen on the throne and unto the land for ever and ever it'll be a universal eternal kingdom and\n\n(23:21) the four beasts the cherubs said amen and the four and twenty elders who had been redeemed remember fell down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever right having shifted from the great throne room steamed we move to the story of the horses of Revelation the opening of the seals the lamb opened one of the\n\n(23:51) seals revelation 6 verse 1 and he sees a horse o rider on a white horse come forth conquering now again we are going to go through seven time periods now the same time periods obviously recapitulate to what we saw before when we dealt with the seven churches because the seven churches tell us about the nature of God's church with\n\n(24:23) all its defects God doesn't hide anything and he tells us this is what's going to happen to the church now these horses represent something else they're going to recapitulate the same time periods but they're going to concentrate on the message on the gospel Herald so not so much the position of the church\n\n(24:45) that is to Herald the information that actual message that has to go out to the world and Satan of course is as opposed to that message as he was to the Son of God he hates it with a passion so when this horse goes out white what is the color white what does it represent righteousness the Bible tells\n\n(25:09) us it represents righteousness and there is nobody righteous but Christ and he has a bow in his hand so there are a number of symbols that we can look at and then there is a another rider one with a red horse and there is a black one and then there is a dead one with a dead rider so who are these riders revelation 6\n\n(25:34) verse 1 and 2 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow there is a clue and a crown there's another clue and was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so there's a war here there's a war you go out to conquer in a war situation\n\n(26:01) Psalm 64 verse 7 will give us a clue but God shall shoot at them with an arrow who shall suit God suddenly shall they be wounded so who's the one who has the bow it's God was the Lord displeased against the rivers was thine anger against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea and that thou didst ride upon\n\n(26:30) thine horses and I chariots of salvation thy bow who they we have the clue was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word sail I doubt it's cleave the earth with rivers Habakkuk chapter 3 verse 8 to 9 9 we have a nice clue is God concerned with conquering the planet in thinking no this is a message it's the\n\n(27:01) Word of God and the arrow is the one that shoots and brings the gospel into the heart and the first message that went up when Jesus started his fledgling church was the message of salvation through Jesus Christ and it went up with power and purity because God had cleansed for himself a people that were\n\n(27:26) willing to stand for righteousness and truth the early church so the gospel Herald that went out was unadulterated everybody knew that Jesus Christ was Lord he alone was able to save and that through his blood we are redeemed that is the story that went out into the world to bring the gospel Herald so it's a conquering faith white\n\n(27:57) represents a pure faith a white woman the woman dressed in white in Revelation represents truth in its purity the bride that has been redeemed and washed in the blood of the Lamb if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you have heard and which was\n\n(28:23) preached to every creature which is under heaven Colossians 1 verse 23 it's very important if you accept this message and you are anchored on the rock so that you cannot be moved then you are settled in the truth and in order to be settled in the truth so that you cannot be moved you have to know the Word of\n\n(28:49) God and you have to eat it that means to internalize it and to act accordingly and we will see that to be so settled in the truth that you cannot be moved is a very important point point that we'll be dealing with in a moment so the second seal is open and here comes a red horse red is the color of what sacrifice it's the color\n\n(29:17) of blood it's the color of sacrifice so when we looked at the seven churches the first one was ethicist you remember and it was a church that had a good message and it was a pure doctrine and they had discernment they could see who those were that called themselves Jews Christians and were not and who tried to\n\n(29:42) infiltrate even at that early stage but discernment kept them out and then came another church that was called Smyrna do you remember that mirror and what happened there there was a time of great persecution and the blood flowed so here blood is flowing and the reason why this blood is flowing is because Satan is\n\n(30:10) counteracting the Gospel message and he's doing everything in his power to corrupt it's those true to principle would rather die than give it up and those not true to principle what would they do they would start compromising and so the road to compromise was slowly opened and the red gospel horse went out\n\n(30:35) and they went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now what is the sword the Word of God so that's the issue the Word of God how'd it goes it says one thing this\n\n(31:03) brings about war and was painful war leads to death and some people get tired of the process so a blood-stained faith is the next one it's a time of great persecution Roman persecution with Nero and all the issues we dealt with when we dealt with the churches so it covers the same time period up to the time of Constantine\n\n(31:31) when persecution was the method method to get rid of the gospel he wrote and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld a lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure\n\n(32:00) of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see that thou hurt not the oil and the wine these are interesting symbols so here is a balance and the color is black now black is obviously the opposite of white is my right so something is happening to taint the whiteness of the pure gospel hero it\n\n(32:32) becomes black and there's something that becomes very scarce wheat and barley and then there is something else that is in trouble wine and oil now these symbols stand all of them stand for the gospel hero you see the wheat is a symbol of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem Bethlehem the breadbasket\n\n(33:03) Jesus says I am the bread of life Jesus is the Living bread that comes down from heaven so the bread is in trouble and the barley was the first harvest that took place in Israel the boy hog in fact the wave offering was from Bali sheaves and it represents also the resurrect in Jesus Christ and the body of Christ\n\n(33:36) The Herald so the wheat and the barley will become scarce the Gospel message of salvation in Christ is under pressure but God is still working and he says do not harm the oil and the wine what is the oil stand for it's the symbol of the Holy Spirit it was poured into the candlestick so that the world might have\n\n(34:02) the light of truth and wine is a symbol of doctrine Jesus says you cannot pour new wine into old wineskins you cannot pour the great message of salvation in Christ into a mould that will not contain it so the wine is a symbol of the gospel Jesus also says I am the vine you are the branches he's the one that\n\n(34:33) gives us life through his gospel Herald so these are the issues that are being put under pressure compromised if you like so the black horse obviously represents a time when the Word of God becomes scarce and this is when the compromised issue comes in so this is the time when Constantine married paganism to Christianity so it's a\n\n(35:02) compromised faith if we follow the same time periods take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock to feed the Church of God for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among stoom so by the way how early in the church would corrupting influences come in right in the beginning right in the\n\n(35:31) beginning there was a man called Simon Magus do you remember him in the Bible and he thought he could by the power with his money do you remember that and Peter rebuked him to his face and he was upset about it he was very upset about it and Simon Magus was from Sumeria and he had a taint of Babylonian wisdom and if we go into the\n\n(36:04) history as we see in the future he was probably the father of Gnosticism and Gnosticism is the issue where Christ is made less than he is so that we can become greater than we are in a nutshell and Gnosticism was the thorn in the flesh of early Christianity and Gnosticism is the controlling factor today as we will see in future lectures\n\n(36:35) the cross of Christ was the divide of history but it costs down the truth to the ground and it practiced and it prospered Daniel 8 verse 12 they would come a power that would destroy the gospel Herald salvation through Christ alone was replaced by the requirements of the church so that's basically what\n\n(37:02) happened and the church set itself up as the mediator between man and God instead of going directly to Christ you went through the church a very sad day God had given a law and man had the effrontery to change the law of God to suit his own needs so in the churches we have Saint Peter or was it Jupiter well actually it came\n\n(37:35) straight out of a temple of Jupiter in the churches Mary became a Mediatrix a mediator and the church teaches that nobody can be except through the merits of Mary that's very strange so all these issues came in and they were a mingling of paganism and Christianity the Bible says quite clearly there is no\n\n(38:06) other name under heaven on earth whereby you may be saved except the name Christ Jesus there is no other name so all these other mediators started coming in and where the pagans had many many many gods so they just developed many many many many Saints and then you could if you had a problem in your life and you\n\n(38:33) came short on merits salvation by works in order to enter into heaven well then you could borrow from the excessive merit of those who had gone before you this is doctrine of the church of the Middle Ages and it is doctrine today and so you could borrow if you like take for yourself a deep spoon of the merit of\n\n(39:01) the saints that had gone before to augment is the paucity of your own merit is that biblical or does each one stand before God in the judgment and gives an account for what he has done in the flesh yes or no yes of course and so all these saints were created and then eventually that the Saints became\n\n(39:27) specialized and that specialization is exactly the same as that you had in paganism one God was specialist in taking care of you during traveling another one was a specialist in taking care of your financial needs and so you had various gods and so today if you want to travel well it's good to have a\n\n(39:50) son Kristopher around because that might just you know help you in your travels so this is a church of compromise and with Jesus Christ there can be no compromise either 'yes lord of lords and king of kings or he is not and that is the choice that we have to make the bible says quite clearly thou shalt not make\n\n(40:15) unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the sea thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them exodus 20 verse 4 and 5 problematic text in the 10 commandments so how about just removing it throwing\n\n(40:37) it into the dustbin well if you look at a normal Catechism book today you will find that this commandment has been removed to open the way for the practices that went before Constantine is the one who first and foremost started to make legislation that would bind the conscience of human beings so rather than listening and accepting the\n\n(41:04) Word of God and making your decisions based on the Word of God man started legislating on this issue and Constantine was the first one to legislate a day of rest for example during this age of compromise the pagans day of the Sun replaced the Bible Sabbath very interesting development that happened over there the early\n\n(41:28) church kept the Sabbath there were two regions where the Sabbath was not kept in the early church the one was in Alexandria where you had the very liberal school which later became the seat of Gnosticism and the other one was in Rome and those two areas were the bastion of Sun worship it's interesting\n\n(42:00) that when Alexandria was destroyed the shift of power moved towards Rome and eventually spread across the entire world we are told by Eusebius by the way that is the bishop but that was active in constant Einstein that constant time in order to recommend the new religion to the heathen transferred into it the outward\n\n(42:26) ornaments to which they had been accustomed in their own development of the Christian doctrine page 372 so this is what they started doing they started compromising on these issues Arthur P Stanley says Constantine's coins bore on the one side the letters of the name of Christ and on the other the figure of the Sun God as\n\n(42:52) if he could not dare to relinquish the patronage of the bright luminary interesting name luminary today we also have people who consider themselves luminaries illuminated ones this is even an organization which calls itself the Illuminati we'll be dealing with those issues as we go along so here is a\n\n(43:16) compromise that has taken place the retention of the old pagan name of dear solace or Sunday is in a great measure owing to the union of pagan and Christian sentiment with which the first day of the week was recommended by Constantine to his subject pagan and Christian alike as the venerable day of the Sun history of the Eastern Church\n\n(43:43) page 184 so this is historic fact we cannot deny it this is what happened for in six days says the Bible the Lord made the heavens the earth to sea and all that in them ease Wow is that sentence under attack today in the scientific world yes or no like you cannot believe there is hardly a word in the Word of\n\n(44:06) God that is not being assailed in this day and age that we live in all that in the meze and he rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it Exodus 20 verse 11 so here were issues of compromise that were coming in they were changing the face of Christianity now what about all\n\n(44:28) those dear Christians that wanted to do exactly what the Scriptures said what happened to them they were eliminated off the face of the earth they were destroyed by sword and the story of how it was done is the most diabolical scariest story that we can imagine in the world today Wow where did the early church reign when it\n\n(45:04) Christianity stopped did it start in Rome yes or no no started in Jerusalem that's where it started that's where Christianity has its seat and it's spread across the Middle East when it Paul knew most of his preaching he went to Rome to die but where did he establish the churches in Asia Minor that's where he preached and that's\n\n(45:35) where the church grew and the church grew across the entire region which is today Iraq and Iran and Pakistan all the way up to India that's what the Bible says and into Egypt and into the north of Africa that's where the cradle of Christianity was and today Christianity has been obliterated from its seat of\n\n(46:03) origin and has been replaced by an entirely different religion which denies Christ and his divinity interesting thought we'll come to that in a moment and God blessed the seventh day and he sanctified it because that in it he rested from all the work which God created and made the Catholic Encyclopedia tells us the Church of the\n\n(46:28) changing the day of rest from the Jewish Sabbath or seventh day of the week to the first made the third commandment referred to Sunday as the day to be kept holy as the Lord's Day the Catholic Encyclopedia volume 4 page 153 well why the third commandment why not the fourth like it was in the Bible because they had\n\n(46:50) removed the second commandment which says thou shalt not make for yourself an idol now is that not missing with the Word of God isn't that rewriting the Scriptures absolutely so not only did they take the authority of God away who said remember the seventh day because I am your Creator and I made you they took it away\n\n(47:18) and said no I will decide when you shall do what and I am the new authority in your life so it's not a question of a day as much as it is a question of authority who has authority the one who makes the law is the one who has the authority the one who changes the law is the one who says he has more authority\n\n(47:43) than the one that went before right or wrong so here is a power that says I have more authority than God I'll change it it's a question of authority don't mess with God her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the profane neither\n\n(48:05) have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean and I've hid their eyes from my Sabbath and I'm profaned amongst them Ezekiel 22 26 that's an interesting statement so they profaned the Sabbath's they make no difference between clean and unclean hang on a second how do we talk today that there is a difference that there is\n\n(48:30) no difference anymore isn't that right I mean if you read the NIV it even says there is they by jesus declared that all things are now clean so the NIV says King James doesn't say it but the NIV says it very interesting we have to look into that issue it's a bit complicated now it's just sort of to wake your\n\n(48:55) appetites so the black horse represented this time of compromise when things started to change and by 538 ad a decree went out that a certain power the Bishop of Rome had the power to become the corrector of heretics that means he became the authority to dictate the conscience of men interesting not God man had taken\n\n(49:28) that position and once man usurped the authority of God then the gospel is dead because my Bible says there is no other name whereby you can be saved and my Bible says there is no other mediator except than man Christ Jesus and my Bible also says that if somebody sins we have an advocate and that advocate is\n\n(50:04) Jesus Christ but now we have another advocate we have to go elsewhere to find forgiveness and we have someone who tells us what's right and what's wrong contrary to what the Word of God said this is problematic this is problematic and when he had opened the fourth seal I looked and behold a pale horse and his\n\n(50:25) name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him hardest the grave this is a sad story of how a Gospel message of salvation was taken to the point of death and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth so this power that takes away the gospel Herald controlled a fourth part of the earth an\n\n(50:58) interesting point which Christian denomination controlled the false paths of the world Wow to kill over the sword that's an and a literal sword and with hunger hunger for what there's a famine in the land for what for the Word of God did the Church of the Middle Ages take the Word of God away yes or no did it ban\n\n(51:27) the Bible was it a sin to the point of death to have and read the Bible yes or no yes history proves the fact I'm not attacking any individual and talking about a system and what is behind the system there are many many many dear people hungry for truth in every single religion in the world and I believe many\n\n(51:56) of them God recognizes as his own because they are living up to the best life that they have so let's not be judgmental we're talking about a system and it's a sad sad system my father wanted to be a Roman Catholic priest he was a very very good Catholic I was raised the Roman Catholic and I became an atheist but I became a\n\n(52:28) Catholic again and when I discovered the Bible I saw that there were so many issues that were not biblical and I had to make a choice and I believe everybody has to come to that point where he has to make a choice between being fooled by the systems of man or by the systems of God and with death and with the beasts\n\n(52:56) of the earth so how did he kill he killed with assault that's literal that he made he killed with a famine for the Word of God and he killed with a death and with beasts beast in Daniel is a kingdom the four beasts you saw are four kingdoms that shall arise upon the earth Daniel chapter 7 so he killed with\n\n(53:22) political powers did the Church of the Middle Ages do that yes or no absolutely take the vol densest of all dances were destroyed of the face of the earth it all begins as France the first alliance between a European nation and Rome was with the Franks Clovis became a champion Emperor for the cause and any opposition\n\n(53:52) was destroyed and the gospel died man had taken the position of God so the new Christians were as far as thinking and habits went the same as the old pagans there surged into the churches did not wipe out paganism on the contrary hordes of baptised pagans meant that paganism had diluted the moral energies of\n\n(54:17) organized Christianity that to the point of impotence centuries of Christianity a concise history page 58 history attests to the facts and unfortunately I cannot change them I didn't invent them I'm just telling you what the book of Revelation says about the faith had died and formalism took the place of a simple\n\n(54:45) beautiful trust in the Son of God do you know when I was a Catholic I used to sit in the church and I used to know that according to the teaching the host was in the tabernacle and that was God and I could pray to him I used to sit there and I used to say why don't you answer me why can I run bring my problems to you\n\n(55:13) and speak to you as to a friend everything is ritual do you want to communicate with God say 10 Hail Marys one our Father 10 Elmer is one our father 10l marries one our father and pray right through the rosary and end up with the confession of faith if you haven't got it done yet do it again and again and again and the more\n\n(55:38) you do it the better is that communicating with someone is that how you would speak to someone you love you no man has a hunger to communicate with God man has a hunger to touch and feel the divine hand and man is being robbed of the beauty and the simplicity of communication with God prayer is not bringing God down to us\n\n(56:10) prayer is bringing us up to God it's not a beautiful sense of upliftment we dressed down here with all the problems of the world with no solution when God is just a prayer away if we would say Lord I have a problem can I come to you I'm sure the Lord will incline his ear to us and we'll listen to every word\n\n(56:38) that troubles us we can take our largest problems and our smallest problems directly to God we need no one else it is a beautiful truth and when we discover it then no matter how glorious and pompous and beautiful everything is without love there is nothing what is what does Solomon say rather live on the\n\n(57:07) corner of the roof and rather have a house with cabbage leaves than a house fold with good food if there is no love it's not point in it rather be poor and have love than to have riches and sadness is nothing wrong with being rich God can bless riches as well it's the love of money that is the root of all\n\n(57:35) evil if you leave the love of out then you have a problem so a union of church and state came about governments were used to enforce doctrine Christianity became an established religion in the Roman Empire took the place of paganism Christianity as it existed in the Dark Ages might be termed baptised paganism\n\n(57:58) church history century - chapter 2 section 7 these are statements made by the church themselves they even said the God pan is not daddy's baptized so paganism rules in the world today and there is an elevation of the priesthood of a man there is the most diabolical thing that has ever happened in the\n\n(58:27) history of the human race do you know that to elevate one portion to control the conscience of others and we have the same problem today there are some who believe that because they have theology they have the right to control your conscience hello each one is accountable to God himself and the Bible teaches no\n\n(58:54) such thing unless you change the Bible we'll be dealing with that it's being changed somewhere not in the old ones that's still fine you can read the whole German Luther Bible that's great you can read the Armenian Bible that's great you can read any Bible from Russia to Serbia anywhere in the world you'll find it all\n\n(59:15) nice and right there but there's a problem later on we have an elevation of the priesthood of the general people there's no such thing in the Bible but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day proverbs 4 verse 18 so the light of truth would penetrate into\n\n(59:38) this darkness God would not permit he's Gospel to die so God had to do something what was the next church that was to bring lights and the word back to the people remember the seven churches we had the church that came in Sardis and it represented the Reformation to reform that which had died it's really not a\n\n(1:00:08) complicated concept and when he had opened the fifth seal I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on\n\n(1:00:26) the earth are these literal souls under the altar it must be pretty crowded there or is this the blood of all the saints crying out to God when are you gonna do something about this I think that's the image that we're getting here so all those that died for the faith all those that were destroyed for what they\n\n(1:00:48) believed crying out to God and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest sleep yet a little season until their fellow-servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled God says I'm in control it's gonna get worse but\n\n(1:01:12) wait till everybody throughout history that he's still going to die in the faith all for the faith is together and then the kingdom will come so these are instruments of torture that we use nothing could stop the gospel he wrote and did you know that some of these instruments of torture was still used in\n\n(1:01:38) 1974 very interesting Franco in front offense pain used those instruments of torture still in the 1970s beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnest contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints don't just\n\n(1:02:05) give up for there are certain men crept in unawares ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ Jude chapter verse three and four Wow so right there in the early church the corruption came in and what did they deny Jesus Christ the only Lord\n\n(1:02:33) God and our Lord Jesus Christ so a shift took place in that early church already big problem and we will see what they did because we will go into it in detail and I would affect us today because these smart people have done the same thing to us and we are not even aware of it isn't that sad so God wants us to\n\n(1:02:59) know like the successive strata of the earth covering one another so layer after layer of forgeries fabrications was piled up in the church the Pope in the council's page 117 not only false God's elevating man above the deity but actually false manuscripts corrupting the Word of God as well but there were\n\n(1:03:27) the vol tenses and where did they get their manuscripts they got them from the Syrian church from the cradle of Christianity they didn't get them from Rome they had the scriptures as they came down the ages it's interesting that those nations that came across the top areas they had these scriptures but\n\n(1:03:50) there were other documents that were being used in Alexandria and in Rome we'll deal with that in another lecture and these people made the Word of God their best young and they preached it and because of it the ire of the world was upon them and they were fought tooth and nail they were they were smashed the infants heads\n\n(1:04:14) against the rocks they threw them down the cliffs but the gospel would not die this is an old Valdes Ian Church and Bible copyist table there and so slowly the faith was uplifted again in thirteen hundred and seventy the authority of the Bible was declared with power by Wycliffe in 1400 obedience to God obey\n\n(1:04:42) God rather than man and he died for his faith Johan hosts these are the men dressed in white and then salvation by grace Martin Luther what a stalwart did he do everything perfectly absolutely not but man did he live up to the knowledge that he had didn't he he's a champion in my eyes and so is Johan\n\n(1:05:06) Hostin Wycliffe these are real champions Tyndall and all these people that gave up their lives for this truth Martin Luther had the courage to go and say this is what's wrong we have to correct it and we saw here I stand and I can do no other 15:21 then John Calvin came on and did he have confused ideas predestination\n\n(1:05:30) this that and the other all kinds of ideas but man did he live up to the knowledge that he had and the life that he had freedom of conscience in fact the entire American Constitution is based on what Calvin wrote that man should be accountable to God alone for what he decides that's the basis of the American\n\n(1:05:56) Constitution that's Calvinism he had many things wrong but boy did he bring out this point right down the throat of those who opposed it and these people died and there are monuments in their honor today and then Williams came along in 1650 he discovered baptism by immersion beautiful truths in the Bible\n\n(1:06:21) unfortunately as we said last time all these faiths decided they wouldn't go along with new light because they worshiped that the shrines of their founders that's not the problem of the founders that's the problem of the followers right or wrong so the followers have more of a problem than the founders because if they discovered\n\n(1:06:42) light they should embrace it but no they wouldn't so we have a fragmented Church today go ye therefore and teach all nations teaching them to observe what does it say there all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world Matthew 28:19 and 20 these are the\n\n(1:07:05) issues that are important all things learn I will accept only what my founder discovered all things or nothing so if you are looking for a church what would you do wouldn't you look for a church that embraces all the truths of all the faiths yes or no wouldn't you look for one that in the Bible does everything\n\n(1:07:32) according to the doctrine at least according to the Bible don't look at individuals individuals are not trustworthy you must look at the Bible and what the official teaching is and if it is what the Bible says in the Bible alone then go along with it shouldn't be too difficult shouldn't be too difficult\n\n(1:07:56) then came Wesley and he lifted up Jesus Christ like he'd never been lifted up in the world before the lordship of Jesus Christ if the Lord Jesus is not the center the author the finisher of our faith forget it then it's not biblical so what a great discovery of light and I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal\n\n(1:08:23) and lo there was a great earthquake interesting so we're now coming into an interesting time period the Reformation had done its work and the churches that followed off the Sardis were which ones do you remember Philadelphia and here there was an accumulation of truth but before this event something was going to\n\n(1:08:49) happen behold when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind revelation 6:12 and 13\n\n(1:09:07) these are celestial signs did they take place absolutely marks is the same thing chapter 13 verse 24 in those days after that tribulation that tremendous persecution where God's people were virtually wiped off the face of the earth and the Middle Ages through the Inquisition and the 30 year war and the\n\n(1:09:31) hundred year war and Bartholomew night and the Huguenots were hounded then came light and after that tribulation which ended roughly 1798 and we'll come to that in another time another lecture the Sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light well here's the history of where New Hampshire because\n\n(1:09:55) Christianity had fled Bible based Christianity had fled from Europe and established itself in a number of regions in the world in the new world the United States of America in particular in southern Africa and in Australia that's where Christianity had fled interesting story as to what's happening in those regions of the world\n\n(1:10:24) today the dark day of new england's are familiar to old and young came Maine nineteen seventeen hundred and eighty near eleven o'clock it began to grow dark as if night were coming then ceased their work the lowing cattle came to the bonds the bleating sheep huddled about the fences the wild bird screamed and\n\n(1:10:41) flew to their nests the fowls went to their roofs at night it was so inky dark that a person could not seize hand when held up nor even a white sheet of paper that's the history of where New Hampshire 1735 - 1888 the independent chronicle of 7/8 1780 said during the whole time a sickly melancholy gloom of\n\n(1:11:03) across the face of nature and he goes on to say that notwithstanding there was almost a full moon which by the way was like blood no object was discernible and it was an Egyptian darkness impervious to the eyes the great memorable events the Connecticut legislature was in session and they gave it up because of\n\n(1:11:27) the darkness they sojourned and Herschel the great astronomer admits that the dark day may 19 1780 is something that astronomy cannot explain there was no eclipse there was no reason scientifically speaking for it but there it was right on time and then November 30 in 1833 this amazing shower from heaven with two\n\n(1:11:52) hundred thousand meteors per hour it was so light you could read and the interesting thing is they came from a central point normally if you have shooting stars they're all over the place but not in they came from a central point and spread across the sky nobody had ever seen something like this before\n\n(1:12:10) and prior to these events there was the great Lisbon earthquake so the sequence exactly like in the Bible and something new had to be discovered well William Miller was the 11782 to 1849 who started rediscovering something else in the Bible and he discovered some of the great prophecies unto 2300 days then\n\n(1:12:35) shall the sanctuary be cleansed and he calculated the day and discovered the beautiful Messianic prophecies of Jesus and of the cleansing of the century and he thought Wow does this mean Jesus is coming again and he started to preach that Jesus was going to come in 1844 because he figured that the cleansing of the sent sanctuary\n\n(1:12:59) meant the cleansing of the earth but of course Jesus didn't come in 1844 so in the 1840s there were a group of believers that call themselves Adventists now these weren't seventh-day Adventists these were Adventists people that believed in the soon coming of Christ and they came from every single Christian denomination in the areas they\n\n(1:13:24) were Baptists and Methodists and Presbyterians you name it they were there over 200 ministers of the various churches believed in these studies that made prophecy come to life again but of course it didn't happen but at least what it did it opened up the hope for the second coming and William Miller\n\n(1:13:48) is the herald for the re-establishment of prophecy and the role of prophecy in Christian history so all these great truths coming back into the Christian thinking and then of course a final restoration had to take place embracing all the truths the law of God doctrines on death and hell and all these things\n\n(1:14:19) how we should live what the parameters were that God required from us all of these things had to be restored because surely God would not end it without light shining upon his people to open up all the truths that had been lost truth had to be restored and then Christ would come jesus said if you love me keep my\n\n(1:14:46) Commandments John 14 verse 15 he who says he loves me and keeps not my Commandments is a wife a liar and the truth is not in him haven't we got many groups today that say the commandments have been done away with yes or no yes that be nailed to the cross Jesus says that the law will never pass away heaven and earth will pass\n\n(1:15:14) away but not one jot or one tittle will be removed from the law until all things have been accomplished surely it is common sense to know that if people would just keep the law of God we can throw away all our keys and all the young ladies and women could walk safely in the darkest alleys of this world\n\n(1:15:35) without any fear if everybody kept the glow of God isn't that right so the law of God is going to be an issue at the end of time especially since a whole organization has had the effrontery to change it Wow to say we are greater and more powerful than God we will modify his law in vain do they worship Me\n\n(1:16:00) teaching for doctrines the commandments of men Matthew 15 verse 9 when man elevates himself to the position of or above God and then you know that it is time for God to act thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in if the turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my\n\n(1:16:27) holy day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honorable there would be a restoring of the breach the gap in the wall that is supposed to protect us from evil the law was not made to restrict us the law was made to protect us like a loving father or mother would put their arms around their children and make rules to protect\n\n(1:16:52) them and the Sabbath was to be called the delight not a burden the Jews had made the Sabbath a burden they had lost place so many restrictions upon it that it was a misery to keep it who could be happy if you weren't even allowed to walk a couple of paces to go and meet those you love Wow so there had to be a restoration of the\n\n(1:17:16) spirit of the law and faith in the Word of God the revelation by John tells us all these things as they would unfold and I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud\n\n(1:17:40) voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship Him that made the heavens the earth to see in the fountains of water revelation 14 verse 6 and 7 the gospel the everlasting gospel had to be restored you see the Jews relied on the obedience to the law and they nailed\n\n(1:18:07) Jesus to the cross and the Christians rely on the merits of Jesus and nailed the law to the cross both of them are standing on one leg isn't that right the law and the gospel they go together if you want to choose Jesus as your Savior you must be prepared to accept him as your king isn't that right and a king is\n\n(1:18:31) a ruler and a ruler by the very name has rules right or wrong this and what's so difficult about loving Jesus enough to keep his Commandments it's not so tough if I love my wife with all my heart and with all my soul well I want another absolutely not and if I think of the consequences that it would cause the pain and the suffering\n\n(1:19:00) would it even be worth it I don't think so same with God if I love God with all my heart with all my soul what I want to serve another why not they're useless they can't save me they can't do anything for me even if I had a selfish motive it would be better to stay - to God yes or no yes so the law makes\n\n(1:19:22) sense so here is the message that says God is the creator what's the world teach you came from evolution you are the product of a rock that's what it says yes the earth dissolve created eventually the materials out of which law life evolved spontaneously so you come from a rock I believe that I come from a rock but the\n\n(1:19:50) rock of ages' and the other sheep I have which are not of this fold them also must I bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd you cannot have a divided truth either these truth what there is division and you cannot have unity in falsehood yes or no no you either have\n\n(1:20:15) unity in truth or there is no unity there is only a presumptive unity that at the first trouble will fall apart as though it had never existed either it is based on truth or it's based on nothing here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus revelation\n\n(1:20:39) 14:12 do you know what fascinating sentence they the faith of Jesus Wow the Bible has very high standards do you know that it's not enough to have faith in Jesus it's not enough you need the faith of Jesus in the greatest adversary Jesus trusted in the merits of his father yes or no yes no matter what\n\n(1:21:14) happens to you you need to trust like he trusted that's the standard well God adds his merit because we are weak and we cannot do these things but that's the standard that's something to aim for well I wish I had the of Jesus then I would be willing to go to the cross because I knew that he would resurrect me and I would be his\n\n(1:21:39) eternally I could die no matter what happened Jesus at that faith we need that kind of faith how many people have that kind of faith still today the stylism the Bible are high and they're high were the reason and the message goes out to the world that Jesus Christ is Lord and we are right here and the\n\n(1:22:02) heavens departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were removed out of their places we've gone through all the seals we're right between the 6th and the 7th seal the next thing that happens when that last seal is opened then the testament of god is open and the kingdom becomes\n\n(1:22:24) the Lord that means Jesus takes over on this planet and he's coming again we've been through history we are the last people the last ones in this great message and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid\n\n(1:22:47) themselves in dens and rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand that's the next thing that's going to happen and by the\n\n(1:23:04) way please look that the people hide themselves there's no great joy by the great multitude so when judgment comes you have to stand there is no such thing as everyone will be saved you have to make a decision here and then follows chapter 7 which is parenthetical and tells us who will be able to stand and\n\n(1:23:28) it says only the sealed will be able to stand and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour well if you work that into prophetic time that's about a week or exactly a week so the question is what is the silence about I believe heaven is empty because Christ and all\n\n(1:23:52) his angels are down here to receive the redeemed Christ is coming again with power and glory and either we are rooted in him or we are not that is the choice that we have and I would suggest that we accept the fact that Jesus is in control Jesus has given us a vision of the great throne room where he's seated in the\n\n(1:24:20) throne of power and he's the one who has the authority to open the seals to receive a kingdom and we can be part of it or we can reject it my prayer is that we will all accept salvation in him because he is the only name whereby we can be saved amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]\n\n(1:27:05) [Music] you",
  "# Title:209_when_trumpets_sound_total_onslaught_walter_veith_thegreatcontroversy_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nTrumpets' interpretation,Numbering of people,Seal of God,Sabbath's significance,Woes and deceptions\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture delves into the intricate and often debated topic of the \"trumpets\" in the Book of Revelation, cautioning against dogmatic interpretations while emphasizing their nature as judgments throughout Christian history. The speaker highlights a crucial distinction between the \"numbering of God's people\" (Revelation 7), who are sealed in the truth and saved by the blood of the Lamb, and the \"numbering of the demonic counterpart\" (Revelation 9), representing those who are lost due to their rejection of God's law and Christ's salvation. He posits that the trumpets chronologically parallel the seven churches and seals, unfolding before the \"close of probation\" and are partial judgments, unlike the final and complete nature of the seven last plagues. A central theme is the \"removal of Jesus Christ as the sole savior,\" whether through historical events like the fall of Jerusalem and Pagan Rome, the rise of apostasy and spiritual darkness in the church, or the emergence of philosophies and organized powers like Islam and rationalism that actively dethrone Christ.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 209 - When Trumpets Sound _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJEge2pTgts\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well the topic now is when trumpets sound and this is a very tricky subject and there are so many views on the trumpets that uh I don't think it would be right to be dogmatic about it and say this is exactly what it is let's look at the various issues and see how it fits in because we have lots to learn and I'm\n\n(01:33) sure there are many many things in the Book of Revelation that uh will only become clearer as the actual events unfold so there's a numbering of the people of the Earth in the subject in these subjects so in Revelation chapter 7 and in Revelation chapter 9 there's a binding and a loosing and they are related to\n\n(01:56) Four Angels in both sections people are being numbered in Revelation chapter 7 the people of God are being numbered in Revelation chapter 9 the Demonic counterpart is being numbered so there's a numbering those that are with God those that are against God in both the words are heard I heard the number\n\n(02:22) kmon I heard the number so he heard the number of God's people he heard the number of those that are with the other side and of course you know that statement you are numbered and found wanting that's what we find in the Old Testament so it would be nice to be numbered and not to be found wanting and the way to do that is to\n\n(02:54) cling to the Savior so let's look at the numbering of God's people in cont trust to the devil's people you know what's interesting God always gives the positive before he tells us about the negative before we saw how the gospel heral would be destroyed in the Seven Seals he gave us a picture of the throne\n\n(03:18) room with such awesome power as I said this chapter is parenthetical it is put there in Brackets to tell us something about God's people before he tells us again about the worst things that are going to happen who is able to stand is the question the answer is only the sealed will be able to stand so we would want\n\n(03:42) to know what that means the numbering of the people of God takes place just before the close of probation prior to the opening of the seventh seal so in other words this is an issue that takes place just before the coming of Christ where there will be a final numbering of the people of God obviously God is going to wait until the\n\n(04:05) full number is in because he told those symbolically sleeping under the altar that they will have to wait until the full number has been brought in isn't that right so that's what the issue is about and then we get to Revelation chapter 8 after chapter 7 and it says and when he had opened the seventh seal\n\n(04:26) there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour so this chapter tells us about the sealing event for the people of God at the end so let's go through it Revelation 71 and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind\n\n(04:49) should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree now the sea Waters in The Bible are a symbol of the Nations the Earth is the planet itself the tree in the Bible is a symbol of the individual Nebuchadnezzar was a tree that was cut down I saw the wicked flourishing like green trees Etc so that's a symbol of the individuals and\n\n(05:17) these four Heavenly angels are holding back the Winds of strife until God's people should have been sealed so the final destruction configration on the earth chaos that will come is being held in check by God irrespective of how bad it looks God is in control that's what it says so there are four Angels holding the Four Winds\n\n(05:44) until God's full number had come in and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was was given to hurt the earth and the Sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed\n\n(06:08) the Servants of our God in their forets now what sits here in the foret the seat of your intelligence the seat of your decision making capacity your Consciousness this is what sits here in the forign this is what makes a difference between us and any other creature on this planet any animal this is the great cognitive decision moral\n\n(06:40) seat in the human being and here is where you make a decision for or against something and as we saw in the previous one it to be sealed is to be settled in the truth so that you cannot be moved but God also seals these individuals and I heard the number there we hear the number of them which were sealed so these are the people of God\n\n(07:10) and they were sealed 144,000 of all the tribes of the children of Israel Revelation 72-4 now some people like to make this a literal number and say there are literally 144,000 that are sealed but remember he heard heard the number what does it mean to be sealed well 2 Timothy 2:9 nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure\n\n(07:40) having this seal that the Lord knoweth them that are his so he has sealed them and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity so what does that tell you these people have made a decision to stop doing what is wrong wrong and to do what is right in the strength of the Lord and to ask\n\n(08:03) the Lord for forgiveness for that which they have done wrong and to ask for cleansing in the blood of the Lamb simple as that it's not a complicated issue we always make it more complicated than it is and the word over here for iniquity is unrighteousness Injustice unrighteousness of heart and life a deed\n\n(08:25) of violating law very interesting so if you depart from iniquity you become law abiding if you love the Lord you keep his Commandments be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your WTH neither give place to the devil let him that stole steal no more but rather let him that him labor working with his\n\n(08:50) hands the things which is good and that he may have to give to them that needeth let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use for edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearers it's not a very complicated issue it means start doing what is right and give up what is bad\n\n(09:11) and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption so people that are sealed have to start doing what is right they have to if they were thieves stop stealing if they have a mouth they must clean up their act they must start doing what is right in the strength of the\n\n(09:35) Lord let all bitterness and wroth and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you Ephesians 4: 26-32 it's not a complicated issue come back into harmony with the law of\n\n(09:56) God that's what it means bind up the testimony seal the law amongst my disciples to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them you cannot say I'm a Child of God but I can live like I lived before uh-uh to the law and to the testimony I Delight to do thy will oh my\n\n(10:26) God yeah thy law is within my heart so Psalms 40:8 for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days says the Lord I will put my laws in their mind where's that it's here in the for and write them in their hearts so that they can act accordingly and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me\n\n(10:50) a people Hebrews 8:10 we always make these issues so complicated it's not that complicated do what is right and leave the consequences to Gods now in the heart of the law there is the Sabbath remember the Sabbath to keep it holy six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord\n\n(11:11) thy God not the third day not the fourth day the seventh day is the Sabbath in it shal Thou shalt not do any work nor thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man servant thy mid servant nor thy cattle nor the stranger that was within thy gates for in six days the Lord made the heavens the Earth the sea and all that\n\n(11:32) is in in them and he rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it so here in the Sabbath commandment is another seal it says there in six days the Lord that's the name yah made he's the Creator Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is so if we look at Exodus 20:1 in six days\n\n(12:01) the Lord made the heavens the Earth the sea and all that is and he rested Noah on the seventh day wherefor the Lord blessed the Sabbath day hallowed it he put it aside for Holy use and the word rested there means to give Comfort to be Confederate to lay to let down to be quiet in other words to have a quiet\n\n(12:25) moment with God in all excitement on this Earth moreover I also gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctifies them and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that you may know that I am the Lord your God well there are many gods out there\n\n(12:52) which one are you serving the one that you obey how do you obey him by keeping his law and if he said honor the seventh day then which day should you honor the seventh day well Exodus 31:13 also says the Sabbath is a sign throughout your Generations that you may know which God you're serving it's me\n\n(13:16) I'm the lord of the Sabbath hello me Exodus 31:16 wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generation for a perpet ual Covenant it is a sign between me and them that he rested on the seventh and he was refreshed naash interesting word sign in the Hebrew is O and it\n\n(13:45) means a mark that's what the concordance says it means a mark a distinguishing Mark so what is the mark of God the Sabbath why because the Sabbath ratifies if I the law without the Sabbath the whole of the Ten Commandments could be from Joo isn't that right could be from joeo what if I made Ten Commandments and I\n\n(14:12) sent them out and I said everybody keep them because I say so what would you do you would think the man's gone nuts wouldn't you but what if the president of the country did it if he made a law and he said I want you to keep these and I sign it and if you don't well I have authority to do something about it then\n\n(14:30) it becomes a little bit more important right now what if the god of the universe says boom I make this law Heaven and Earth it is to be experienced as a Perpetual law well that's pretty authoritive so if it doesn't have that stamp of approval it means nothing so it is God's Mark of authority does the Beast also have a\n\n(14:55) mark yes it also has a mark of authority we'll get to that a little bit later so we must understand God's mark his sign or his seal just like a seal authenticates a document the president of the United States for example that's the Seal of the American president or the typical Royal seal it says I King so\n\n(15:16) and so the name title King territory Whatever It Is England or whatever and right here in the decalog there must be a stamp a authenticating the document and you find it in the Sabbath commandment without the Sabbath the whole of the Ten Commandments is just another set of laws made by who cares who but with the Sabbath commandment in\n\n(15:45) it has the name of the lawgiver and the territory and it's binding so it receives its authenticity and the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with the Finger of God Deuteronomy 9:10 there are only a few times when God wrote with his finger did you know that each time he wrote with a finger this is one of them he wrote the\n\n(16:08) Ten Commandments with his own finger in stone and he repeated it when Moses broke them so that's twice and then when the kingdom of Babylon came to an end God wrote with his finger against the wall and the Prophet Daniel said many many par wow that's what it means your kingdom has been numbered and given to\n\n(16:34) the mes and the Persians it's another time that God wrote when there was a judgment a final judgment which serves as a type of what is coming and there was another time when God wrote in the sand that's when all the accusers came and accused the certain Lady Mary who had been found in adultery and he stooped and he wrote\n\n(16:59) with his finger in the sand I wonder what he wrote there because when they read it they all turned away and had nothing more to say he that is without sin Let Him cast the first stone maybe they saw written things there they didn't really like to read isn't it possible just for interesting sake so God's seal is in the\n\n(17:23) heart of his law remember the Sabbath that keepeth Holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the sth is the Sabbath of the Lord yve your God in six days yve Lord made Creator Heaven and Earth there you have it the Lord Creator Heaven and Earth authenticating the whole document so it has his name\n\n(17:45) his title his territory I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that I am the Lord how are you supposed to keep it well we read about that not doing thine own pleasure it's amazing how few rules there are on how to keep the Sabbath the Jews couldn't handle that so they made a couple of thousand on how you're\n\n(18:07) supposed to keep it instead of leaving it to the conscience not doing thine own pleasure that seems sensible calling it holy honorable honoring him not doing your own ways finding your own pleasure speaking your own words delight yourself in the Lord so these are the positive things that come out of the Sabbath not\n\n(18:31) a day of Misery by the way today is the seventh day it's the Sabbath did we have a day of misery so far I haven't and was it only for the Jews no also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone that keepeth the Sabbath even them will I bring to my\n\n(18:53) Holy Mountain and make them joyful In My House of Prayer wasn't a Jewish Sabbath in fact it comes from Genesis it comes from creation for mine house shall be called the house of prayer for all people the Sabbath was for everyone Isaiah 56: 6 and 7 and it will be if you will listen carefully to my Commandments which I\n\n(19:19) command you today take heed to yourselves that your heart may not be deceived and then you go running after to other gods it says bind them these Commandments as a sign upon your hand and as frontlets between your eyes wow the Commandments must be on the hand and on the for what does that mean so they wrote them up stuck them\n\n(19:44) over here and bound them around their hands job done do you think that's what God had in mind I somehow don't think so that's ritualizing the law and it might be sincere but it's not what is meant here it means think and act accordingly that's what God wants and God says his Commandments must be in your mind and in your actions and\n\n(20:12) another Power will come and says uhh my Commandments in your minds or in your actions interesting distinction well we're not going to go into that Deuteronomy says the same thing on the hand or here on the forend and it will be a memorial between thine eyes and on the hand that the Lord's law may be in your mouth Exodus 13:9 so God\n\n(20:38) has something that must be sealed in the mind the law of God and the Sabbath is the sign thereof in a very particular fashion so the purpose of the Sabbath was to be a day of rest a day of blessing a day of peace a sign a memorial to Creation a symbol of sanctification ation and a hallowed day and a Perpetual Covenant those were the\n\n(21:03) reasons why God gave the Sabbath so that we shouldn't forget him and what he has done for us and so the law of God in its entirety with acknowledgement of his authority in our lives will bring us into harmony with Heaven again through the Redemption which is in Christ Jesus and that is what it means to be sealed\n\n(21:26) to come back into harmony with God so how many are sealed revelation 75 out of the tribe of Judah 12,000 Reuben 12,000 Gad 12,000 Assa 12,000 nephlim 12,000 and so we go down through manasi and Simeon and Levi and Asaka and Zebulon and Joseph and Benjamin and they were all sealed 12,000 so do you think it's a literal number\n\n(21:56) exactly 12,000 out of every tribe What About Us then after this I beheld and lo a great multitude you see you heard the number but he looks and sees he beholds a great multitude which no man could number of all the nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood Before the Throne and before the lamb clothed with\n\n(22:21) white robes and Palms in their hands some people make long discourses about the 144,000 when the Bible doesn't tell us very much about them and seeing that the whole book is symbolic obviously this is also symbolic because we're going to run into trouble if it's not for example if we look at the 12 tribes of Israel then we'll see\n\n(22:45) that uh Levi is mentioned here in Genesis Joseph is mentioned over here Levi is also mentioned in Revelation over here and Joseph in Ezekiel we have the tribe of Dan which is not me mentioned over here at all but it's mentioned in Genesis we have Ephraim mentioned here in Ezekiel and we don't have Ephraim mentioned here at all so\n\n(23:12) Which tribes are you going to take if you want to make it literal you're going to be in trouble is nobody ever going to be saved out of ephra and Dan Dan were pretty bad and they did funny things but there were lots that were heroes from the tribe of Dan Heroes so obviously it's a symbolic number and\n\n(23:31) I don't think we have to go any further into it it's a multitude of twelves for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of\n\n(23:54) God Romans 2: 28 vers and 29 is it only Jews that are going to be saved from the literal tribes what about all the Gentiles that have come in through the gospel Herald so we cannot literalize the 144,000 and in any case who is a Jew who is a Christian it's one who is one inwardly Galatians 3:29 says if you be\n\n(24:21) christs then you be Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise so what does that make us that gives me a chance to be a Seed of Abraham Abraham seed and HS according to the promise if I accept Christ well I wasn't a Jew so I was a pagan but in Christ I can be Abraham's seed because Christ is Abraham's seed and if I am in\n\n(24:51) him then I am redeemed so now the question of Jew or Christian is irrelevant if you have Christ you are Abraham's seed no matter what your circumstances of birth were for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but a new creature and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them\n\n(25:14) and mercy and upon the Israel of God Galatians 6:15 and 16 so how do I become part of the Israel of God of all ages I accept the Lamb of God a Jew was was not saved by keeping the law he had to bring a lamb and Slaughter it and he was saved by the blood of the Lamb maybe he rejected the lamb later on\n\n(25:40) but that was the method whereby he should be atoned for and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sth upon the throne and unto the lamb and all the Angels stood around about the throne and about the angels and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and they worshiped God saying amen\n\n(26:03) blessing and glory and wisdom and Thanksgiving and honor and power and might be unto our God forever and ever amen who wins Jesus wins again we have this wonderful theme where Jesus comes in the Revelation and he tells us about the Redeemed and how they are sealed settled in the truth that they cannot be moved back in harmony with the\n\n(26:27) law of God God saved by the blood of the lamb and he gives us this beautiful picture before he gives us the bad news it's a theme in the Book of Revelation you never have to be afraid because he is the Victor the king of kings and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in\n\n(26:49) white robes and whence come they and he said unto me sir thou knowest and he he said to me these are they which came out of the Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white and the blood of the Lamb therefore are they Before the Throne of God and serve him day and night in his Temple and he that sth on\n\n(27:13) the throne shall dwell amongst them that is the conclusion of the matter a great story about Victory in Jesus Christ before the bad news comes they shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto\n\n(27:41) living Fountains of waters and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes isn't this great here's the promise before the bad news and then comes Revelation 8 and when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about space of half an hour we've dealt with this text already this is when Christ returns\n\n(28:09) and I saw the seven angels which stood before the before God and to them were given the seven trumpets now come the seven trumpets and people say well this must be after the close of probation no no no all we had was a chapter which says listen folks this this is the outcome God's people will be Redeemed by\n\n(28:33) the lamb and there will be no more tears and this is the number of them and this is what it's going to be like that's the victory in the lamb now let me give you the bad news this is what's going to happen in history and those that reject the word of God and reject Jesus Christ will also be numbered and sadly the number will look\n\n(28:58) look slightly different let's see what happened and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense where's this Angel standing at which altar the altar of incense the\n\n(29:27) altar of incense sense was it in the first chamber or in the second chamber it was in the first chamber so it cannot be after the close of probation Jesus is still ministering in the first chamber there still has to come a second chamber and when that's finished it's over then it's too late so here we are\n\n(29:49) in which part of the kaym the first part Jesus is still in the Holy place and many people want to take these prophecies and throw them into the future into the eschatological arm into the end time events portrayed in the Book of Revelation and they violate the kaym you cannot violate the kaym you cannot tear something out of its\n\n(30:16) position and throw it where you want it you have to stay within the rules that's why it's written like that so you shouldn't be able to do that so much incense there's the altar of incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is Before the Throne that's the\n\n(30:33) little altar that we're talking about and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand here are people praying there is some need here still this is not after the close of probation right at the end of time no no this is a continuous process\n\n(30:55) so would suggest we follow the same proc process as the others were this is a pattern in Bible prophecy Book of Daniel does the same thing Daniel chapter 2 goes through the history of mankind Jan Daniel chapter 7 recapitulates it in another format Daniel chapter 8 takes it recapitulates it in another format and\n\n(31:17) so you have different views coming to light same in the Book of Revelation you go through the seven churches this is the position of the church you go through the Seven Seals this is the position of the Gospel Herald now we come to the trumpets which are judgments because there is a numbering and you are found either wanting or you\n\n(31:40) are found righteous here is a judgment issue and who is the judge Jesus he decides who makes it and who doesn't and he doesn't neglect the prayers of the Saints it is through his mediation that they are made acceptable in the eyes of God so the Merit of Jesus Christ is the issue here at stake the smoke of the incense which\n\n(32:08) came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand so the incense is a symbol of the Merit of Jesus Christ being added to the Saints making them acceptable in the eyes of God wonderful image everything is so loaded with meaning in the Book of Revelation we could speak for hours just on the\n\n(32:34) symbolism here of this altar of incense and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire from The Altar and cast it onto the Earth down it comes and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and an earthquake Revelation 8 verse 5 well judgments come upon the Earth and after the final judgments just as Jesus\n\n(33:11) died on the cross and said it is finished so it will be done and it will be over and the numbering will be done and either you are with the with the sheep or you are with the goats depending on your decision so what are these trumpets of Revelation there are seven trumpets and each one Herald something that happens here on\n\n(33:34) Earth Revelation 8:6 and the Seven Angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound now let's see what happens let me just recapitulate here for you the historic arm had the seven churches the Seven Seals and because we are still dealing with altar of incense time we are dealing before the time that Jesus\n\n(34:00) enters into the most holy so we're dealing with the historic arm they sit in this side of the kaym and I cannot remove them and throw them into that side that would violate the kaym is that clear so obviously we are moving through the same historic period that we have had in the others and to do anything\n\n(34:24) else would be contrary to the system and they all culminate of course in the great climax of the coming of Christ so again we're going to sweep through history and there is a parallel between what happens during the blowing of the trumpets and the Seven L plagues this becomes an interesting point so the\n\n(34:48) seven trumpets are blown before the day of atonement and The Seven Last plagues take place after the day of atonement in other words when Christ comes out of the most holy then the seventh last plagues will fall so if we look here at the trumpets we'll find that the following are affected the Earth 8 chapter 8: 7 the sea chapter 8\n\n(35:19) verse 8 and 9 the rivers and the fountains chapter 8: 10 and 11 sun moon and star s 8:12 so there's Darkness bottomless pit locusts come out 913 to 21 the river Euphrates 91321 loud voices the kingdom of Christ so we've gone through a process and every time a third a third a third a third a third a third is\n\n(35:49) affected if we look at the seven last plagues we have a parallel the first plague hits the Earth the second one Hits the Sea the third one the rivers and the fountains just like the seven trumpets and then the sun just as it was over there Darkness on the throne of the Beast then there's the river Euphrates\n\n(36:11) which you had over there and then you have a loud voice it is done you see there's the it is done so this is what happens after the close of Probation and this must happen before the close of prob because it's only a third a third a third it's not everything a portion is affected and there is room for\n\n(36:36) repentance and it is in the mediation time when Christ is serving in the Heavenly sanctuary in the first chamber and these are very important issues when we deal with this because today there is this tendency to take the trumpets and to make them the same period or just prior to this period over here and\n\n(37:02) that's a problem because not only do you violate the kaym you also violate the component there's only a component that is destroyed Jesus Christ is in control the number of God's people chapter 7 now trumpets and the the numbering of the people of the earth and the problems associated with it who is going to win\n\n(37:36) Jesus or the other one we already know the answer and therefore we can relax as we go through the trumpets may the Lord make us aware of the fact that Jesus is in control when we're dealing with the actual trumpets it gets tricky because we don't really have precise ways of interpreting this but let's look at the various issues this is\n\n(38:03) a very interesting study Joel 2 verse 15 and 17 15-1 17 says blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of closet\n\n(38:28) let the priest the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch on the Altar and let them say spare thy people oh Lord and give not thine in Heritage to reproach that the Heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say amongst the people where is their God here is a situation where a trumpet is\n\n(38:47) being blown under circumstances where God's people have obviously gone astray so let's have a look at the interpret rations the first interpretation is that these trumpets are judgments in our time paralleling the judgments of the plagues that's a very prominent interpretation in the world today personally I cannot accept that\n\n(39:17) particular interpretation for the very reason that it violates the kism it violates the kism and throws into the future that which is in the historic arm of the Book of Revelation secondly it violates the principle that Jesus is here not coming out of the most holy but is obviously officiating in the Holy\n\n(39:39) long before these plagues are going to fall so there are two principles why I cannot accept that particular interpretation yes there are contact points in that the plagues are descriptive of the same thing that happen in the trumpets but the trumpets are partial and the plagues are final and complete so the judgments are\n\n(40:05) obviously judgments in time so judgments the second way of looking at it retrace the periods of Christian history covered in the seven churches and the Seven Seals that makes sense to me at least and some start now now the question arises where do you start these judgments then and who is being judged well some start with the\n\n(40:28) judgments against Jerusalem because Jerusalem are the first ones who rejected Jesus Christ and nailed him to a cross and there was a judgment at the end God still gave them a space of time till 70 AD and then Jerusalem was destroyed right that's a judgment of God and this is using Matthew 24 as a template that seems to me a logical\n\n(40:54) thing to do as well others again they like to start not with Jerusalem but with judgments against Rome because Rome is the power that actually nailed Jesus to the Cross so here you have two opposing views but really it's not such a big deal as to whether the one is perfectly right or the other the fact of\n\n(41:19) the matter is we are dealing with judgments over the time personally I prefer starting with Jerusalem because that's also the temp temp plate that is used by Matthew 24 but I'm not going to make a big deal if somebody doesn't want to believe that and believe the other that's fine let's look at the first\n\n(41:36) trumpet the first Angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the Earth so here is Judgment because parallels also the hail at the end of time but in a partial sense because a third part of the trees the individual were burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up so here is a destruction of\n\n(42:04) people people are being lost here this is serious why are they being lost well the fall of Jerusalem in ad70 is the one possibility and I've colorcoded them here the second possibility is that this is a judgment on Rome and the people that favor this view say it starts with the Visigoths that invaded Rome under\n\n(42:27) alic in ad. 396 to 428 and he pillaged Rome in ad 410 and the Roman Emperor theodosius died in ad. 395 so here we have a picture of the start of the fall of the Roman Empire when uh these various nations came in well this is a judgment that took place absolutely of this power that elevated itself even over the Prince of Peace but\n\n(43:00) on the other hand the fall of Jerusalem is a very powerful judgment after a long time of probation that said while you have rejected the Messiah these are the consequences God removes his protection he allows the wind to blow and this is what happened and the second Angel sounded as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was\n\n(43:32) cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood and a third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and a third part of the ships were destroyed so now again what does this represent what does this trumpet of judgment represent well again we look at the various uh interpretations mountains\n\n(43:56) what do they represent a great Mountain burning with fire well a mountain represents a nation in the Bible you can look that up in Isiah 2 2 and 3 119 1344 4115 Daniel 23544 45 Ezekiel Zechariah all of them have this picture of a mountain let's look at the text in Jeremiah which also brings this picture to the four behold I\n\n(44:24) am against thee Oh destroying Mountain speaking about Babylon says the Lord which destroyeth all the Earth and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt Mountain so here's the symbol of a mountain that is being destroyed so the second Angel sounded\n\n(44:44) and as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea so a nation in other words was scattered amongst the Nations that's what it would mean and a third part of the sea became blood sea is a symbol of waters the waters which you saw are peoples and multitudes and Nations and Kings so\n\n(45:07) Bloodshed amongst this nation and a third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and a third part of the ships were destroyed ship in the Bible is the symbol of the economy the ships of Kim they are economic uh symbols so let's have a look at the two possible interpretation if the first one was\n\n(45:33) judgment on Jerusalem then the second one would obviously be judgment on Pagan Rome and the associated Nations the sea Jews and Christians saw Imperial Rome as the new Babylon in fact Peter even wrote a letter where he said where Babylon is because Rome like Babylon has destroyed the temple and Jerusalem so that is a a\n\n(46:00) reasonable assumption on the other hand some believe that the second phase of uh the Vandal incursion into Rome and jenseric 428 to 468 uh where the word vandalism comes from derived from the vandals and they pirated on ships on the Roman Empire and pillaged Rome in ad 455 so some see this as the symbol and\n\n(46:25) others see it as the encompassing the whole of pagan Rome now whether you accept the one or the other it's a matter of detail right it's not something to make a great issue about it's not going to uh change your salvation in any way personally I like the first one more because it follows a logical time sequence and frame but it\n\n(46:50) doesn't matter if uh others prefer the other one third trumpet and the third Angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven now does that ring a bell I'm sure it does did a star fall from Heaven at any stage yes Lucifer fell from heaven and he brought all his demonic forces with him down here and he\n\n(47:18) was going to affect a great change he was going to take over this Kingdom he wants to be the ruler so false teachings is what he brought with him burnt as it were burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon The Fountains of waters these are also the peoples and the name of the star is\n\n(47:40) called wormwood bitterness and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter now what does water represent besides Nations have you heard of the Water of Life Now what happens when the water of life becomes bitter you see there was a time period when there was compromise\n\n(48:07) that came in the third time period do you remember that isn't this interesting here the third Angel sounding the time of compromise didn't that turn the Waters of Salvation into bitterness yes or no yes and did people die because of it in a spiritual sense now not in a literal sense absolutely because if you\n\n(48:30) drink from this polluted Fountain what is the result death Eternal death separation from God so the great apostasy of the spiritual leadership of the Christian church is the one possibility that we have over here the falling away as Satan fell from heaven with a third of the Angels so the church would apostasies\n\n(48:58) through idolatry wormwood was used by Moses as a symbol of idolatry in Deuteronomy 29:17 to18 let's read it and ye have seen their Abominations and their Idols wood stone silver gold which were among them lest there should be amongst you man or woman or family or tribe whose Hearts turneth away this day from the Lord Our God to\n\n(49:25) go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth Gall and wormwood isn't that a great symbol so I kind of favor this because it's the same time period you have the third angel that was the period of the black horse that was the period of compromise when the gospel was\n\n(49:50) undermined and the waters went bitter and people that drank this new gospel died a spiritual death well the other interpretation would be that the invasion of the Roman Empire by the hanss under the leadership of Atilla in the fifth century so again you have an interpretation that it still deals with the um Roman Empire as such\n\n(50:21) of course this takes place in the Roman Empire so there's no problem but this is the one that just sort of gels it and brings it into line with all the others that we have seen paralleling them so far and you have all the symbols that make this uh seem to be that way now the fourth trumpet and the fourth Angel\n\n(50:45) sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten now the Sun what is that the light of the world and a third part of the the moon and the third part of the Stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day Shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise this is not total darkness as in the\n\n(51:09) plagues this is a third part Revelation 8:12 let's look at Micah 3: 6 and 7 and see if we can pick up a parallel therefore night shall be unto you that you shall not have a vision and it shall be dark unto you that you shall not Divine and the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be\n\n(51:33) dark over them then shall the seers be ashamed and the divinest confounded yay they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of God doesn't this sound like a time of spiritual Darkness yes or no well what did they call the age of the next dispensation if you like didn't they call it the Dark Ages yes or no so who\n\n(52:02) ruled in the Dark Ages once the Dark Horse had changed into a horse of death it's the same time period I believe we're just following the same Classical period and again if you remove Jesus the son of righteousness from the gospel and make him less than he is then you die a spiritual death that's that's\n\n(52:26) the that's the problem how did they remove Jesus from the heart of the Gospel this is the scariest story of deception in the history of the world after this lecture we're going to go into the details and we're going to have a look at what they did and I want to tell you that today the whole world is\n\n(52:46) deceived into believing something that is not from God scary scary so the two interpretations that we have possible here the darkness represents the Dark Ages that makes sense to me when truth was thrown to the ground and the ministry of Jesus was replaced by the ministry of the church when Jesus was crucified a\n\n(53:14) literal Darkness covered the Earth isn't that right and serves as the type of the spiritual crucification crucifixion of Christ the Reformation of the six 16 Century ended the Dark Ages that's basically what this interpretation would mean now another interpretation would still be with judgments on Rome the Sun\n\n(53:41) the moon and the stars have been interpreted as The Luminaries of the Western Roman Empire the emperor the Senators the consul with the extinction of the Western Roman Empire in ad 476 the last Roman emperor Romulus augustulus was dethroned by order of odaka the atian remnant so that's one interpretation we have another judgment\n\n(54:04) here on the uh Western Roman Empire but uh this one over here to me represents a model that is in line with everything that we've seen gone before but I'd like to know you to note something and that is that in this time period of the Dark Ages Jesus is crucified again it's interesting that the crucifixion there\n\n(54:37) keeps him on the cross and that's where the Dark Ages would like him but Jesus has been raised from the dead and he rules in heaven now it is also interesting that to remove Jesus from the system sometimes required even the creation of an entire new religion which would take Jesus away very interesting for Behold The\n\n(55:08) Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee Isaiah 60:2 great Darkness on this Earth then spoke Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the\n\n(55:25) light of life the issue is Christ or not Christ I am come a light into the world that who soever believeth on me should not abide in darkness John 12 verse 46 the issue is Jesus or no Jesus those are the issues now comes a fascinating part Revelation 8:13 and I beheld and heard heard an Angel flying through the midst\n\n(55:58) of Heaven saying with a loud voice wo wo wo three wo to the inhabiters of the Earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpets of the Three Angels which are yet to Sal now comes a great woe now a woe is something that hits Mankind and has dire consequences now some people like to apply the woes to God's\n\n(56:30) people on the other hand the woes could apply to those who are being lost and who are we dealing with under the trumpets under the people of God that are being numbered or under the others that are being numbered we're dealing with those others that are being numbered so now we know what the last woe is for sure because\n\n(56:52) the last woe is the coming of Christ and the destruction of the the wicked so who does it hit the last woe the Wicked the wicked not God's people hits the wicked so why not the other two as well these is judgments on those that have either been deceived and allowed themselves to be deceived because they reject\n\n(57:16) light or who just reject God outward directly so three woes are going to hit the the inhabitants of the Earth and and a woe deprives them of Salvation so the inhabitants of the Earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpets will suffer from these wo so the three woes associated with the next three trumpets imply an\n\n(57:42) unprecedented increase in demonic attack on the truth nevertheless God is in control so during these next three trumpets God is going to give us a glimpse of what is happening here on this Earth it's scary and it will require 12 whole lectures to make us see what is happening wow we're going to do 12\n\n(58:11) lectures on what this entails scary wo wo wo was pronounced upon a church who walked in the Sparks of their own kindling who did not derive their light and power from the Great Central light the son of righteousness and diffuse that light and glory to those who were in darkness by absorbing and diffusing the light they\n\n(58:36) cause their own light to burn brighter the one who receives light but does not give it as God requires him to do will become a receptacle of Darkness this is a writing that we find in a particular pamphlet written uh about about 150 years ago which seem to show exactly what is's happening here so the woes are\n\n(59:04) pronounced upon a CH Church which walks in the Sparks of their own kindling that makes sense to me this makes great sense to me so this woe is pronounced on the apostate people on this planet and will hit them because they are keeping the gospel truth away from those that could be saved so let's look at the two\n\n(59:26) possibilities the fifth and sixth trumpets represent the numbering of Satan's followers and the final increase in evil to the point where God withdraws his protection and hands the willingly ignorant over to a retrograde mind Wow that's scary this is in contrast to Revelation 7 where the Seal of God are numbered and\n\n(59:51) empowered to stand under his Divine protection and the the other interpretation would mean that the fifth and sixth trumpet represent judgments against Eastern Roman Empire the rise of Islamic culmination Islam culminating in the Ottoman Empire is seen as the force to bring about its destruction now here I would like to\n\n(1:00:15) digress from my previous ways and say why not marry the two why not marry them because because Islam makes it its goal to bring Christ down to the level of a human so in a sense it does exactly what the Church of the Dark Ages did by pronouncing itself the judge in the place of Jesus Christ right or wrong so\n\n(1:00:47) the one is just a tool of the other they are actually working together to achieve the same ends to remove Jesus Christ as the only savior of the planet and it is interesting that Islam is a religion that actively propagates and teaches this message actively the others on this Earth do their thing and don't actively fight\n\n(1:01:14) against this particular principle or that one but the Church of the Dark Ages says I am the way whereby you receive salvation you come through me or you don't make it in fact they say God has to abide by the judgments of his priests and to either absolve or not absolve wow and this power says Jesus become\n\n(1:01:39) less than you are so let's why not marry them so which Powers displaced bible-based Christianity and which philosophies arose out of the Dark Ages to Dethrone Christ and deprive mankind of Salvation in him isn't that a good question to ask that there would be woes upon the Earth well Islam replaced Christianity\n\n(1:02:02) in the Cradle of Judaism Judaism and Christianity isn't that right that's what they did B the age of rationalism and contemporary humanism with its slogan no deity will save us we must save ourselves that's comes from the humanist Manifesto chapter 2 edited by KZ Buffalo 1973 this is their manifest so no deity will save us we must save\n\n(1:02:29) ourselves rationalism contemporary human humanism the Bible is a book of allegories don't worry about it this has destroyed Christianity in the western mind and this has destroyed it in the Cradle of Christianity the Bastion of Christianity removed it's replaced him in the west and this has replaced him in\n\n(1:02:53) the East so these are the powers which Dethrone Jesus Christ so now let's go to Revelation chapter 9 and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven again we have the star falling from Heaven unto the Earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit that's hell so whatever doctrine's\n\n(1:03:17) going to come now is coming straight from the pits of hell and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit that's in total contrast to the smoke in the sanctuary above as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit so light is being removed from\n\n(1:03:38) the earth as a result of the activity of the fifth angel wow not the activity of the fifth angel but the curse which comes because of what the powers of Darkness are doing and they came out of the smoke locusts upon the the Earth and upon them was given power as the Scorpions of the Earth have power the appearance of them\n\n(1:04:02) is like the appearance of horses we've had horses before concerns the gospel like the noise of Chariots on top of mountains Nations shall they leap like the noise of the flame of fire that devours the stubble as a strong people set in battle array and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has\n\n(1:04:20) eaten that's what Joel said so we have the symbolism of what was happening in in literal Israel let's apply it to the spiritual one Revelation 9:4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree so not total Destruction but only those men who have\n\n(1:04:42) not the Seal of God in their Forest so the judgments hit those that are being numbered and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented and there's a period there 5 months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion Jesus says I will give you power to tread on scorpions when he\n\n(1:05:04) striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them then there's a description of the locusts they are like unto horses we've had horses before they represented the gospel Herald prepared unto battle and unto their heads were crowns like\n\n(1:05:24) gold and their FA es the faces of men and they had hair as the hair of a woman and their teeth were as teeth of lions breastplates as were breastplates of iron sounds of their wings the sounds of Chariots of many horses running into battle here's a war situation so this is roughly what they look like Tales of\n\n(1:05:44) scorpions breastplates of iron teeth Terrible Things whatever an artist's impression and they had tals like unto scorpions and there were stings in in their tals and their power was to hurt men 5 months Revelation 9:10 what does this mean well some see in this symbolism what Islam did and the other you could see it in the full sense of\n\n(1:06:13) what this new message without Christ would do to the world now let's have a look who's over them and they had a king over them which is the Angel of the bottom less pit whose name in Hebrew tongue is abadon fascinating stuff this but in the Greek tongue has his name apolon one woe is passed and behold\n\n(1:06:41) there come two woes more Hereafter okay well we know some names interesting ones and uh after this one woe upon mankind is finished all right let's ask ourselves a question which philosophies emerged After the Dark Ages which directly undermined F faith in the Bible and Jesus Christ as the only name\n\n(1:07:08) under heaven whereby we can be saved isn't that a good question to ask which organized bodies is the next question I have directly propagate the obliteration of Jesus Christ as The Only Name whereby we can be saved those those are the two questions we would like to an answer well rationalism higher criticism\n\n(1:07:34) humanism spiritualism would you agree that those are the powers that remove Jesus and then which organized bodies directly propagate and obliterate the name of Jesus Christ as The Only Name whereby we can be saved Freemasonry I'll give you text upon text TT upon text to show that they do it and the secret\n\n(1:07:59) societies they all are in favor of total unity and equality of all religious Founders communism directly opposed the doctrines of Jesus Christ formalized atheism that's all that communism was and then you have the World Council of churches is that possible do they actually do that do they I'm afraid so\n\n(1:08:27) because the World Council of churches propagates the unity of all religions Under One Roof and that means that Jesus must become less than he is in order to reach this compromise yes or no so it's just a fact I'm not making this up this is what's happening Islam removes Jesus Christ does it or not as the soul savior\n\n(1:08:50) of the work and the United Nations has an organization which is called the United religions organiz ations whose aim it is to get all religions to accept their equality well that's fine it sounds like a good idea but what does it do to Jesus Christ it puts him on a level with all the others and then there must be many a\n\n(1:09:13) name whereby you can be saved yes or no is this correct or is it not correct you tell me because I'm in trouble here I'm putting certain things up there which are problematic but this is exactly what they are doing communism removes him totally Freemasonry levels him World Council of churches compromises to reach it Islam\n\n(1:09:37) fights him directly and the UN says you better do it or else wow we're in trouble let me read this to you this is net.com Freemasonry let's read it in the 17th degree of the Scottish right the sacred word communicat to the candidate is abadon in the Satanic Bible by Anon Le on page 145 146 abadon and apolon are\n\n(1:10:06) one of the infernal names in Satanism Scottish right Freemasonry Illustrated J Blanchet volume 1 page 453 states touch tyus fored when he answers by putting his hand on your forehead password jalum sacred word abadon didn't we just read that this was an evil angel yes or no so Freemasonry says this is the Angel over us they had as\n\n(1:10:34) Angel over him abadon Satan if you look at the Islamic interpretation this is the range of the desert Locust and that is the range of early Islam and today it covers that and more very interesting this was the range of early Christianity this was the range of early Christianity do you do know that today it's replaced it's gone it's\n\n(1:11:00) been removed it's been replaced by Islam Islam arose only after 600 AD and totally remove Bible believing Sabbath keeping Christianity in the world removed it slaughtered it interesting and today it is forbidden forbidden by law upon death to propagate Jesus Christ in those countries isn't that interesting that is a terrible woe upon\n\n(1:11:38) mankind because if the only name whereby you can be saved is removed that's it you're in trouble John William drao also writes the history of the intellectual development of Europe that four years after the death of Justinian in 571 ad was born at Mecca and Arabia the man who of all men has exercised the greatest\n\n(1:11:59) influence upon the human race according to the life of Muhammad Muhammad appeared on the scene at one of the darkest periods in history when all civilizations from morian Gul to India were falling to ruin or were in a state of troubl gestation here we go Great War at the age of 12 Muhammad traveled with\n\n(1:12:20) his uncle in a trade Caravan to Syria here he met the Christian anchorite called beholding the boy so goes the story who could discern in his face marks of the future greatness and he advised Abu Talib to take good care of him for he would someday be the recipient of a Divine call the recognition of the\n\n(1:12:39) Prophet by bahira the Christian symbolizes in Islamic tradition the Primacy of Muhammad's Mission over that of Christ Jesus is made less Revelation 9:4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the Earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the\n\n(1:13:00) Seal of God in their forests so who's affected by these trumpets God's people or the other people the other people everybody who does not have the opportunity now to choose Christ because they removed it from him they're in trouble and to them it was given that they should not kill them but they should be tormented five\n\n(1:13:24) months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and Death Shall flee from them interesting here's a decree of Abu Bak Muhammad's Uncle who succeeded him when you fight the battles of the Lord\n\n(1:13:42) equit yourselves like men without turning your backs but let not your Victory be stained with the blood of women or children destroy not the palm trees nor burn any fields of corn cut down no fruit trees nor do any mischief to the cattle only such as you kill eat when you make any Covenant or articles\n\n(1:13:58) stand to it and be as good as your word as you go on you will find some religious persons who have retired in monasteries and purpos themselves to serve God that way let them alone and neither kill them nor destroy their monasteries and you will find another sort of people that belong to the synagogue of Satan who have shaven\n\n(1:14:16) crowns be sure to cleave their skulls and give no quarter till either they turn mohammedans or pay tribute well this decree is seen paralleled in the Bible and some believe that the five months represent 150 prophetic days which would be 150 prophetic years using numbers 14 and ezekiel's 4 as template a\n\n(1:14:41) day for a year and so it was worked out that if you take this number and you take the date July 27 1299 when ottoman invaded nicam media then you add the 50 you come to July 27 July 1449 when the last Greek emperor Constantine took the throne with permission from the sultan now khed bin alv valad by name sa\n\n(1:15:10) Allah one of the two Muslim leaders of the normally successful enormously successful Islamic expansion under Muhammed and his immediate successor Abu bakar and Omar although he fought against the prophet the second one he was eventually converted they say and he conquered and khot remained the effective leader of the forces that\n\n(1:15:36) conquered the Byzantine army they routed the Byzantine Army so Islam took over where Christianity reigned very interesting and uh they went on to conquer Syria and Arabia and destroyed 50,000 Byzantine troops and slaughtered them so Christianity was removed let's look at the Masonic view this is morals and\n\n(1:16:00) Dogma this is the Masonic Source when Christianity had grown Weak profitless and Powerless the Arab restorer and icon class came like a cleansing hurricane but khed now you know he was he was this great General the sword of God he was called who had marched from Victory to Victory exclaimed to his weed soldiers\n\n(1:16:23) let no man sleep there will be rest in enough in the bows of paradise sweet will be the Repose never more to be followed by labor the faith of the Arab had become stronger than that of the Christian and he conquered wow this is Masonic view that the faith of the Arab became stronger It also says it became a better Faith than\n\n(1:16:45) Christianity so today Islam rules where Christianity reigned and you have the zigurs and the Ottoman Empire and the blue mosques and S sopia which all used to be Christian domains today Islamic domains this one is used to be Christian today it is Islamic isn't that interesting so if we marry the two then we have the whole full\n\n(1:17:15) catastrophe of apostasy bringing in the destruction of Jesus Christ as the sole savior rationalism higher criticism destruction of the Bible removal of faith in the Bible and in Jesus Christ and literal war against those who opposed them and the six Angels sounded and I Heard a Voice from the four horns\n\n(1:17:37) of the golden altar which is before God saying to the six Angel which had the trumpet loose the Four Angels whoa now in trouble which are bound at the great river Euphrates so here are four other angels we had four angels of God holding the Four Winds now we have four angels that hold the r river Euphrates at the Y\n\n(1:18:03) Euphrates that's Babylon so these are the Demonic counterparts to the Angelic counterparts and the Four Angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year to slay a third part of men and the number of the army of the horsemen were 200,000,000 I heard the number can you hear so here you have\n\n(1:18:27) the numbering of this power and it is an enormous number like the Sands of the Seas so some see this time period as prophetic time the hour the day the month the year and others say no this simply is a definitive statement of the time now this very year this very day this very month this very second this is\n\n(1:18:52) when it'll happen so whether you want the one or the other is probably not that relevant and they probably could both be right some see this period as prophetic time others as a designation of the time for the Demonic forces of Babylon in contrast to the angels of God that hold the Four Winds to issue the last great events of\n\n(1:19:16) the controversy between Christ and Satan so the first woe was this destruction of Jesus uh as the so Savior and then I saw the horses in vision and then that sat on them having breastplates of fire of Yasin and he sees this whole vision of the smoke and they're coming out and doing their thing and a man by the name\n\n(1:19:39) of Josiah Lich he took the literal literal interpretation and he calculated when he took the hour the day the month the year and it comes to 391 years 15 days and he worked out the Ottoman Empire and he predicted the exact day when the Ottoman Empire would fall and it actually happened exactly like that so here's the\n\n(1:20:03) one view the Islamic power there uh officially comes to an end Josiah l published this date two years prior to the event so the four Sultans are seen by some to represent literal Sultans and they even have names Aleppo Iconium Damascus and Baghdad they see the uniforms of the Turkish Horsemen in the description as\n\n(1:20:29) being blue and yellow and they see Islam in all of this and the Ottoman Empire so whether you see it that way or whether you see it the other way in terms of a global spiritual darkening does it really make a difference other interpretations that you could have is the spread of Arabian Islamic empire\n\n(1:20:51) Muhammad 612 founding of Bagdad Dar Salam 762 marking the end of the empires 150 years Fall of Constantinople you get to 1844 there are many many interpretations let's keep it simple the trumpets Herald apostasies on this Earth which number those that are being lost and the removal of Jesus Christ as the herald is of Salvation is\n\n(1:21:21) the biggest problem the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues it repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship Devils this is the point Idols of gold silver brass stone wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders nor of\n\n(1:21:39) their sorceries nor of their fornication nor their thefts so the description of the second Woe in Revelation comes in Revelation 11 and the sounding of the seventh trumpet ushers in the final w the impenitent as the kingdom of God comes to an end now we can't jump and do Revelation 10 and 11 all in one night\n\n(1:22:03) it's going to drive you crazy so what we're going to do is we're going to look at the second woe in the next lecture and you will see that the most terrible deception of all time comes in the next wo and then comes destruction we are living living in the final moments before the Third Woe now what is\n\n(1:22:29) that final deception that will come about if the second woe already removed Jesus as the sole savior then what will happen before he comes with the clouds and every eye shall see him and they which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so amen this is the question we have to\n\n(1:22:54) answer so we've seen apolon we've seen abadon we've seen some statements where organizations claim that this is the power ruling them we've seen possibilities of Islam over here we've seen rationalism and popular humanism and all these things coming in removing the doctrine of Jesus Christ and bringing darkness and woe upon the\n\n(1:23:18) people now when we get to Revelation 11 we will see what the fin deception is going to be how Satan sets up his final Kingdom to attack the word of God scary stuff and then we'll have to do 12 lectures to show that it's really like that may the Lord bless us and keep us until we come together again tomorrow for a next episode in the\n\n(1:23:46) series thank you for coming [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music]

  "# Title:210_the_beast_from_the_bottomless_pit_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nBook of Revelation,Prophetic Timelines,Word of God,Beast Powers,Secret Societies\n\n## Guide:\nThis presentation by Walter Veith interprets the Book of Revelation, particularly chapters 9 and 11, focusing on the symbolic \"Beast from the Bottomless Pit\" and the \"two witnesses.\" Veith explains that the \"beast\" represents false teachings infiltrating and becoming a political, legislated world doctrine, eventually culminating in a specific political entity. This entity, which rose to power around 538 AD and reigned for a prophetic period of 1,260 years (ending in 1798), is identified as the Papacy, which received a \"mortal wound\" during the French Revolution but later revived. The \"two witnesses\" are interpreted as the Old and New Testaments, God's Word, which prophesied in \"sackcloth\" (suppressed) during this 1,260-year period, with the French Revolution serving as a significant attack on their authority. The lecture also touches upon the rise of secret societies and their role in establishing a human-centric standard that replaces God's law, ultimately aiming to dismantle the authority of the Bible and set the stage for a spiritual \"Babylon.\"\n\n## Content:\n(2) 210 - The Beast from the Bottomless Pit _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04lfx8EoWEU\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] tonight is a tricky subject and I'm almost nervous to approach it but we are going to power through and it's going to get worse before it gets better so we might as well just dive in and say some of the things that the Book of Revelation says you know we are always so scared to say The Book of\n\n(01:30) Revelation says but then on the other hand I'm personally very grateful that it does say these things because I myself have been trapped in many of these deceptions and I'm so grateful to God for having said these things so that we can make decisions to sever the ties that bind us to all these strange Winds\n\n(01:59) of dark which we take so for granted because we don't know anything else the Simplicity of knowing Jesus Christ and him crucified escapes many of us and if only we knew what a friend we have and how approachable he is and how easy it is to be in contact with him we would save ourselves many a tear and many a trouble\n\n(02:28) well who's this beast from the bottom pit and where do we read about it well we finished last night up to the end of chapter 9 now logically we should go into chapter 10 but I will Reserve chapter 10 for a little bit later because there are two sides to a story the one is the apostasy as it grows and we started that last night and\n\n(02:54) we show how showed how spiritual Darkness increased on this Earth and how a star fell from heaven and smoke started coming out of the Bottomless Pits that means satanic teachings were starting to emanate and take control of the Earth tonight we're going to go a little bit further and we'll see what eventually is the culmination of these\n\n(03:23) things that come from the bottomless pit and it will develop into a beast that comes from the bottomless pit now what is a beast well again we have to ask the Bible and in Daniel chapter 7 a beast is very clearly defined as a king of a king or a kingdom it's a kingdom so here is a political entity that is manifesting itself so in other\n\n(03:50) words the false teaching have become so widespread that they have infiltrated into a political system and have become World Doctrine if you like that's scary legislated world Doctrine in its fullness we had not seen it at this stage when it appears but it will grow into a worldwide phenomenon and that's the scary bit and\n\n(04:19) the question is who's behind it all and that question we also want to answer tonight Revelation chap 11 we're skipping 10 because that's the counterparts and we'll be dealing with that a little bit later and there was given me a read like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of\n\n(04:43) God you know when you measure something you're seeing whether it measures up isn't that so the Bible says we are the Temple of the Living God so do we measure up measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein so just like we had a numbering so now we have a measuring but the court which is without\n\n(05:14) the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city they shall tread underfoot they will trample upon the truth of God and upon the Salvation in Christ which is typified in the sanctuary everything in the sanctuary is typical of Christ the door the Gateway where you came in is a representative of\n\n(05:41) Christ the door the altar of burnt offering is a representation of the cross the lamb that was slain Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world the Laver that washes he's the one that washes away our sins you must be borne by water and the spirits if you go into the first chamber Jesus is the light of the\n\n(06:06) world Jesus is the bread of the presence Jesus is the bread from Heaven he is the incense that makes us acceptable through his Merit to God if you're go to the final chamber he's the lawgiver he Shields us from the condemnation of the law through his Mercy wow everything's there in the sanctuary it's beautiful\n\n(06:30) message so here is the story of Salvation in Christ which will be Trampled Under by certain Gentile forces and this will be done for 4 and2 months now that's a prophetic time again and uh it would be interesting to know what this entails and of course it is a quote from The Book of Daniel chapter 7 where all the attributes of the\n\n(06:58) Antichrist are given including the fact that he reigns for this period and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy that is preach 1,23 score days clothed in sack cloths now that's what we call Hebrew parallelism you say something in one way and you repeat it in another way so the\n\n(07:28) first 42 2 months is followed by 1,260 days and in prophetic terms they're the same period 42 prophetic months the prophetic month had 30 days 42 * 30 is 1,260 days 1,260 Days a day for a year 1,260 years we will come to that later is a period when when the sanctuary will be Trampled Under Foot and God's people\n\n(08:03) as well now who are these two witnesses that will stand up for what God has to say well these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks the light standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them let's take note of this if any man will hurt them fire proceeds out of their mouth and\n\n(08:28) devours their enemy and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed don't mess with these olive trees don't mess with these two candlesticks well it would be interesting to know who they are isn't that so well let's first have a look at this prophetic time period so there's a key to the Year Day\n\n(08:54) principle and we find it as the period of rain of the little horn power in Daniel 7 where it says they shall be given into his hand that's the Saints of the most high for a time times and the dividing of times that is three and a half prophetic years or 42 months or 1,260 days we'll see the parallels in a\n\n(09:21) moment and calculating the length of this prophetic period is greatly simplified if we note these simple points a time was a year and some of the newer translations will just say 3 and 1 half years that's 360 days you can see Daniel 4:16 and 1113 margin in the uh authorized version of the Bible the King James prophetic\n\n(09:47) time or year had 360 days a day means a year or a time means a year in Bible prophecy you'll find that in the authorized version so we add add it up and it comes to 1,260 days and you can look up numbers 1434 and Ezekiel 4: six where it says I have appointed thee each day for a year proof of the pudding is always in the\n\n(10:15) eating so these are then actually 1,260 literal years now here are some other regions where you will find these texts Dan uses the the terminology in 12:7 a time times and a half Revelation 11:2 40 and 2 months Revelation 113 1260 days Revelation 126 1260 days Revelation 12:14 time times and half a Time\n\n(10:48) Revelation 13540 and 2 months all referring to the same time period I'll show them to you again in a little while now 10 kingdoms of Rome that that emanated from Rome were established in ad. 476 and in Daniel it says that this power that would control or have control over God's people would arise after the\n\n(11:17) establishment of the 10 Kingdoms in other words after Western Rome was divided into 10 well this period is very interesting because after this period in a. 538 the papal rule commenced according to the Justinian decree which said that the papacy would be the corrector of Heretics and that he would be the head\n\n(11:47) of all the churches so you had a church State scenario now if you add to that date 1,260 years you get to an interesting date 7 1998 let's look at these time periods again Daniel 7:25 the time times and the dividing of times Daniel 12:7 a time times and a half Revelation 11:2 40 and2 months Revelation 113 1260 days\n\n(12:17) Revelation 126 1260 days Revelation 1214 time times and half a Time Revelation 1354 and 2 months do you think God is serious about telling you about this time period it seems like it he he wants us to know something about this time period and we can find out from the Bible that they mean the same thing through Hebrew\n\n(12:41) parallelism for example in the Book of Revelation it will say a woman a Wilderness 1,260 days in another verse it'll say a woman a Wilderness 42 months in another place it will say three and a half years and so you can see that they apply to the same thing a very very important prophecy now in 1798 something very\n\n(13:11) interesting happened Bertier the French General marched into Rome under orders of Napoleon and he arrested the pope and declared the papacy at an end declared it at an end now it is important to note that the papacy was a political entity and if you take the definition of Daniel chapter 7 that a political entity\n\n(13:39) is called a beast power the kingdoms you saw the four beasts or four kingdoms which shall arise upon the Earth then if you end that political power well then that Beast dies now it's interesting that it to this particular power there's another interesting verse in Revelation which says it seemed to have a mortal wound\n\n(14:06) but the Mortal wound was healed in other words it dies but it comes back and this power was reinstated as a political entity in 1929 when musolini granted the Papal States and political autonomy to the Vatican again so there was a beast a political religious geopolitical entity it received a mortal wound over here and\n\n(14:33) yet it Rose and received it back again and then there are some interesting things in the Book of Revelation about this so let's look at this Mortal wound on the 21st of February 1798 pop pias the six was dethrown by Napoleon his ring was torn off from his finger that is the symbol of his power and he died in Exile so there was\n\n(14:59) a mortal wound by December 1804 Pope Pas witnessed uh Napoleon Crown himself Emperor here was now a pop Pope without a political entity to rule it had been taken away 1808 Napoleon took the Vatican state so he confiscated the entire state of the Vatican 1848 Masini attacks Rome and Pope pasas the 9th is\n\n(15:27) exiled he's restored in 1850 but he had lost all the Papal States so there was now no longer a political entity there was a mortal wound and the timing amazing 5:38 he ascends the throne under the protection of the Eastern Roman empire under the emperor himself and assumes the authority of the Justinian\n\n(15:54) decree 1,260 prophetic days later later the political power comes to an end interesting immediately Napoleon reinstated religious freedom in 1806 on the 30th of May and so we had a power that ruled over God's people for a period of time politically dictating to other political forces what they should\n\n(16:26) do with denters you see Rome never put anyone to death never the Inquisition was run by the Jesuits and uh later by the Dominicans but the Jesuits were the original inquisitors they would find someone guilty and hand him over to the state who put him to death that's how it worked now who are these two witnesses that witnessed in\n\n(16:59) sackcloth during this time period my two witnesses these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the Earth by the way did the Roman Church suppress the scriptures during its period of rain yes or no yes I was a Catholic it was a mortal sin to read the Bible it was a mortal sin later\n\n(17:23) on after 1962 that was rescinded and changed and we'll come to why very interesting stuff in a subsequent lecture so who are these two witnesses could they perhaps be the scriptures the old and the New Testament is it possible well let's go to Zechariah and see if we can find an answer Zechariah 4:1 and the angel that talked with me\n\n(17:51) came again and walked me wake me as a man that is Wake out of his sleep and he said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick now here you have a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and he seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the\n\n(18:10) top thereof and two olive trees there we have the same symbol so Revelation draws on the symbolism in Zachariah here and remember that the power that ruled for 1,260 years as a political it having political muscle over everyone that dented as a heretic for example is involved so we'll look at Zachariah and see if we can find some\n\n(18:41) other images here that might be interesting so we find the candlesticks that are mentioned in Revelation we also find the two olive trees that are mentioned in Revelation by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof verse four so I answered spoke to the angel that talked with me saying\n\n(19:00) what are these my lord well that's what we're just asking so maybe we can get an answer and the angel that talked with me answered and said to me knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord just like we would say what are they and then he answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zabul\n\n(19:21) saying and then he says whatever it is there is to say so what are these olive trees and the candlesticks the word of God the word of God so this word of God was prophesying in sackcloth in other words suppressed for 1,260 days you know when the Reformation started printing the Bible they started using the guten back press and they just\n\n(19:47) marched in there and they smashed it and they burnt every Bible that was being printed and they tried to destroy it with every means at their disposal without much success well later on they wrote their counter version which is known as the Jesuit Bible we'll come to that later verse 11 then answered I and said\n\n(20:13) unto him and what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the Candlestick and upon the left side thereof and I answered again and I said unto him what be these two Olive brones which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves and he AED me said noest th not what these be\n\n(20:30) and I said no my Lord then he said these are the two anointed ones Anointed with power from God in other words Theo through the holy spirit this message of God this word of God was to be preached to the world whether suppressed or not that stand by the lord of the whole earth and then I turned and I lifted up\n\n(20:57) my eyes and and I looked now what is he going to see he's going to see what it's all about a flying roll now what's a flying roll that's a scroll that's the word of God was in a scroll so he sees the word of God flying through the air what's that a symbol of taking the message to the world so this is what it's all about\n\n(21:20) it's about the word of God and he said unto me what seest thou and I answered I see a flying roll the length thereof is and he gives the length and cubits and he said unto me this is the curse That Goes Forth over the whole earth for everyone that stealth shall be cut off these are the warnings of God As on this side according to it and\n\n(21:43) everyone that swear shall be cut off on that side according to it I will bring it forth says the Lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof\n\n(22:01) and the stones thereof okay so the word of God will convict whether it's suppressed or not is that right basically what it says let's read on because Zechariah gets interesting then the angel that talked with me went forth remember Revelation 11 is quoting from Zachariah from these very verses and we can get\n\n(22:24) more information what was that I said in the beginning to the law and to the testimony so now we're digging in the testimony to see what other prophets had said that would be in harmony with what's going on over here lift up now thy eyes and see this that goes forth and I said what is this and he said this is an EA wow now\n\n(22:49) it gets interesting that goes forth now what is an EA an e was a measure it was a standard measure wherein you would measure flow for example now in the Book of Revelation wasn't there some measuring going on yes or no aha so here we have another measuring going on we have the standard of measurement obviously the standard for\n\n(23:19) whatever is right and what is wrong but here is an interesting standard that has set itself up what is this and I said this is an EA that goes forth and he said moreover this is their resemblance through all the Earth this standard is what you will see throughout the Earth and behold there was lifted up a talent\n\n(23:42) of lead you see the EA had a lid on it a heavy lid and uh this lid here was a heavy lid it was made of lead so he lifted up this lead lid and he looked inside the EA which is the standard of measurement and what does he see inside a woman that sth in the midst of the AA oh that's interesting what's a woman in the\n\n(24:14) Bible it's a church it's a church so there is an apostate Church on this Earth and there is a righteous Church on this Earth and in in this one there sits a woman so there is a standard an e that is being set up by a church is that logical that sit us in the midst of the F and he said this is wickedness so this is contrary to what\n\n(24:46) the scroll had been saying the scroll in the beginning had said I will convict You by my word if you steal you will know about if you do this that and the other my word will convict convict you but here is another standard on Earth and it is controlled by a different church and it's a wicked one it says\n\n(25:04) it's wickedness and he cast it in the midst of the Eartha and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof so this woman was revealed for a time and then the lid was put back oops now that's interesting did the reformation reveal a standard that was not biblical yes or no sure did and the lid was lifted up and everybody could\n\n(25:29) see it what did the reformation call Rome blatantly said Antichrist and then closed what's the Reformation say today publicly officially by all their sinns what did the Lutheran Senate decide 1994 I think was the date if I am correct she may no longer be called Antichrist calvinist decided the same all of of them decided the same thing so\n\n(26:00) the lid goes back on then lifted up mine eyes and looked and beheld there came two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stalk oh that's bad news that's bad news because you see the stalk is an unclean bird and a bird in the Bible here is the symbol of the holy spirit so here are\n\n(26:26) two groups which will now through the workings of a false Spirit lift up this standard with the other woman in it Between Heaven and Earth and they said to the angel that talked with me whether do these bear the EA this standard and he said to me to build it a house in the land of sha that's Babylon and it shall be established and\n\n(26:56) set there upon upon her own base wow what Zachariah is saying is that another standard will reign on this Earth the standard will be set by a church everybody will have re a knowledge that it was wickedness it was revealed but the wickedness is being covered up and then two powerful Church groups the Bible calls them the dragon\n\n(27:25) and the false prophet powers will come and lift up this standard and say there it is and the Babylonian Empire will be reborn in spiritual Sense on this Earth with a standard that replaces God's standard does that make sense scary is it going to happen well let's see what the rest of Revelation has to say on the\n\n(27:49) issue the word of God now we've had a background from the place in the Bible where Revelation takes its imagery and tells us what's going on the word of God Revelation 11:6 these have power to shut Heaven that it rain not does the word of God have power to do that absolutely did Elijah do it Elijah prayed under the\n\n(28:17) instigation of God and said it will not rain three and a half years and it didn't rain 3 and 1/2 years interesting that this prophetic power Reigns 3 and 1/2 prophetic years no rain what does that mean spiritually a barrenness for the word of God so they made war against the word of God not in the days of their prophecy so\n\n(28:42) there was spiritual Darkness we've dealt with that already and have power of the waters to turn them to blood and to Smite the Earth with all plagues as often as they will wow bad news if you take the word of God away you're in trouble and when they shall have finished their testimony in sackcloth the Beast that ascendeth out of the\n\n(29:07) bottomless pit shall make war against them now when will they have finished their testimony in sackcloth after the 1,260 days well if that prophecy is correct then that brings us to about 1798 and in that time period a power will start emerging on Earth which will make it its business to destroy the word of\n\n(29:36) God interesting so after 1798 a power will emerge that will make it its business to destroy the word of God and this Beast descendeth out of the bottomless pit now who was in the bottomless pit before well the star that fell from Heaven made smoke come out of the bottomless pit his false doctrines wafting across the Earth and now it is\n\n(30:05) being established to the point of authority so this is Satan's kingdom growing on the Earth but remember God is just watching it and permitting it and telling you about it and he shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so there must be something happening with a word of God is officially\n\n(30:29) rejected but this is a greater involvement there is going to be the rise of a kingdom that officially wants to obliterate the word of God and their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt where also our Lord was crucified now our Lord was not\n\n(30:55) crucified in Sodom and he was not CR crucified in Egypt so only in the form of his people can he be crucified now is there perhaps a little typology that we could grab onto here is there anything that happened round about this time period 1798 round about there where there was an attack on Words God on the\n\n(31:16) on the word that was a mixup of words I'll repeat that where there was an attack on the word of God in a place where God's people had been sacrificed if you like killed murdered for the sake of their faith so Christ being crucified again in the form of his people is there a country that did that actually there is\n\n(31:43) very interesting country and that country was France and uh they did exactly this they are enacting a little miniature in uh the the book great controversy there's a beautiful statement on this issue let's read it the great City in whose streets the Witnesses are slain and where their dead bodies lie is spiritually Egypt of\n\n(32:11) all Nations presented in the Bible Egypt most boldly denied the existence of the Living God and resisted his commands no Monarch ever ventured upon more open and high-handed Rebellion against the authority of Heaven than did the king of Egypt when the message was brought him by Moses in the name of the Lord Pharaoh\n\n(32:32) proudly answered who is Jehovah that I should obey his voice to let Israel go I know not Jehovah neither will I let Israel go this is open Rebellion against the word of gods goes on to say this is atheism then and the nation represented by Egypt would give voice to the similar denial of claims of the living Garden would\n\n(32:53) manifest the like Spirit of unbelief and Defiance the great city is also compared spiritually to Sodom the corruption of Sodom in Breaking the Law of God was especially manifested in licentiousness in other words you know sexual depravity if you like and this sin was also to be preeminent characteristic of the nation that should\n\n(33:18) fulfill the specification of the scripture now I can go along with that that's pretty fascinating stuff where also our was crucified this specification of the prophecy was also fulfilled by France I agree with that in no land had the spirit of enmity against Christ been more strikingly displayed in no country had the truth encountered\n\n(33:40) more bitter and cruel opposition in the persecution which France had visited upon the confessors of the Gospel she had crucified Christ in the person of his disciples I concur with this I would like to go even further and say that France is just the very beginning the the kernel of the rise of the kingdom of\n\n(34:01) Lucifer and I will prove that as we go along with help from many quotes and we will see what was set up there which is going to rule the whole world today and it affects you and me directly this is not just history this is history in application this is the famous jacobine hat that was worn by the French\n\n(34:29) revolutionaries they wore the jacobine hats now what the jacobine hat means I will be dealing with in a later lecture actually it's the Hat of Mitra it's Mitra ISM Sun worship but never mind we'll come to that later Revelation 11:7 and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out\n\n(34:50) of the bottomless pit shall make war against them now what happened in in France is the Forerunner take note what happened in France is the Forerunner of what will happen in the entire world scary and shall overcome them and kill them did France after the French Revolution make war against the word of\n\n(35:20) God Revelation 11:9 and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and Nations shall see their dead bodies 3 days and a half we have another prophetic time three and a half days would be three and a half years and shall not suffer their dead bodies to put in the graves well from November 10 1793 to June\n\n(35:45) 1797 they did that they banned the Bible officially by government decree they banned the Bible and they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them the two witnesses the old and the New Testament make Merry shall send gifts to one another did the French do that yes they actually did that because these two\n\n(36:07) Prophets The Bible had tormented them that dwelt on the earth in actual fact they only believed that this Bible had tormented them the people but somebody else actually believed that this Bible was a tormenting power and I will show you tonight who that power is that made war against the Bible and after 3 days and a half the\n\n(36:32) spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood up on their feet and great fear P upon them which saw them did it destroy the Bible no after this event which was just the beginning of this great attack on the word of God power came into the word of God and the Bibles went all over the world all the great Bible societies were\n\n(36:55) started after this day and the Bible was put into every hand that wanted it in the whole world this infuriated the beast from the bottomless pit to such an extent that it changed its tactics of war and we'll be dealing with that in two lectures called the battle of the Bibles and changing the word don't miss\n\n(37:20) those lectures they're coming up and they are powerful if you're angry with me tonight come back anyway okay even if you're angry it's okay you can be angry with me but come anyway so this word of God stood up and preached with power Hereafter but the war wasn't over it just began they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto\n\n(37:41) them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them and the enemy I'll tell you hates the word of God and the same hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth part of the city fell obviously referring to this spiritual City Babylon if you like was shaken by this\n\n(38:05) Resurgence of power in the word of God and so Satan redoubled his efforts to Crunch it again thereafter and in the earthquake was slain of men 7,000 again that is a symbolic number and the remnant were AF frighted and gave glory to the god of Heaven notice the second woe is passed and behold the Third Woe cometh\n\n(38:35) quickly a woe is something that makes it impossible for the people to find truth the first woe was the destruction physically of the original Christian areas through powers that were against Christ this woe is now a spiritually darkening of all knowledge pertaining to God by this power who makes war on the\n\n(39:07) word of God what happened in the French Revolution let's just see how it fulfilled these prophecies this was the storming of the bastile and of course at this very event the whole political structure in the world changed whereas before you had monarch ruling now you have democracies and democracies are going to rule\n\n(39:32) everywhere and that sounds very good and we will see exactly what is behind all of these things later so Louis the 16th well he lost his head literally and his head was held up before a cheering crowd as he went to the guillotine and his wife Maria anet did they have mercy on her no her head was put on a steak and held up to a\n\n(40:03) cheering crowd and then they took a prostitute excuse the picture but this is what they actually did with open breasts and they called her Liberty they made her a goddess LIberty Leading now we read again what happened here in the book great controversy tells it to us quite beautifully when the goddess was brought into the convention\n\n(40:29) the orator took her by the hand turning to the assembly he said Mortals cease to tremble before the powerless thunders of a god whom your fears have created wow this is a public assembly henceforth acknowledge no Divinity but reason can you imagine that I offer you its noblest and purest image if you must\n\n(40:54) have Idols such sacrifice only to such as this fall before the August Senate of Freedom veil of reason so here was a power that had taken away the word of God and replaced it with a goddess of reason but fortunately Jesus told us ahead of time that it would happen and this means that uh this goddess of Reason takes the place of\n\n(41:24) Jesus Christ only in appearance the goddess after being embraced by the president was mounted on a magnificent car and conducted amidst an immense crowd to the Cathedral of notam so it was made official to take the place of the deity then she was elevated on the high Altar and received the Adoration of all\n\n(41:49) present so the government adored this lady this is how it was done she was taken through the street she was put onto a cart she had a sun symbol and it said goddess of Reason over there and she was enthroned in notredam and that which they believed Christianity had stood for was Swept Away by the legislature and the Old Testament and\n\n(42:18) the New Testaments were burnt and all religious books were burnt on a funeral p and a new law replace God's law can we replace God's law I don't think so that scroll that flies through Heaven the word of God condemns us of right and of wrong measures us according to its standard irrespective of whether another\n\n(42:51) Institute raises up another standard right or wrong yes and so tonight we will see how this battle continued how one standard was laid aside and how mankind adopted another standard and may God help us to choose between standards we continue the story what happens when you replace God's standard with human\n\n(43:26) standards human standards are made to look good but obviously they have their problems well during the French Revolution a new standard for mankind evolved and this standard was termed the manifesto of human rights now isn't it fascinating that the French published their first manifest of human rights in\n\n(43:55) this form isn't that fascinating as two tablets of stone what does that actually represent the law of God here was man putting down another law this is fascinating stuff oh there's so much symbolism in this it's way too big to deal with it with this tiny slide I will put it up in another lecture in all its\n\n(44:18) glorious detail and show you the symbolism behind it I'll just mention just one this year a bundle of rods a bundle of rods uh this one over there a serpent with its tail in its mouth that one over there the allseeing eye in a triangle interesting symbolism this one's fascinating a bundle of rods what does\n\n(44:43) that mean those were fasi fasi you see the Roman uh proconsul he took a bundle of rods fi and he took them upon the mounts and if he was accepted as the leader of all he put a wreath around it and he was all powerful and in command all control through the power of one man it's called fascism FAS fascism if you think of\n\n(45:21) Adolf Hitler fascism if you think of mus all power in one man he was called the f is that right okay and that is the system of control now human rights what is that got to do with fascism isn't that kind of interesting I would say it's kind of interesting but we'll we'll leave it for another lecture the first\n\n(45:47) Charter of hum of Rights uh to Nations was actually declared by Cyrus the Great in the Persian culture there was this great fundamental principle good thoughts good words Good Deeds Cyrus the Great good thoughts good words good deeds and his uh manifest went like this when my soldiers in great numbers\n\n(46:15) peacefully entered Babylon I did not allow anyone to terrorize the people I kept in view the needs of people and all its sanctuaries to promote their weal wellbeing freed all the slaves isn't it interesting that Napoleon freed all the slavery and he ended religious suppression and all these things I put an end to their\n\n(46:39) Misfortune and slavery that was quite a good manifest and I mean human rights look pretty good we read on in the great controversy Century after Century the blood of saints had been shed she talks about the valenzas the AL gas and she talks about the Protestants who were slaughtered and much of it by the power of\n\n(47:03) France this is the Inquisition and the tools of the Inquisition the axe that chopped off the head then uh instruments of terrible torture and they were mainly tortured for heresy now what's the definition of heresy let's look in artical heresy page 440 Greek rist choice decid iding for oneself what one\n\n(47:28) Shall Believe and practice that's heresy so deciding for yourself was in this time period of 1,260 days was an act of heresy was a sin punishable by death that's pretty sad isn't it so taking away the conscience of man setting up a power now here we're going to have have some very interesting things happening these were some of the\n\n(47:58) instruments they used these were for example tongs that opened up and you put hot coals in them and then you sort of modified the person who you were interrogating with these hot coals these here are ankle guards or ankle clamps and you'll notice the pins in them that when they were screwed tight they went\n\n(48:21) right into the bone I mean these people were pretty serious about what they did this particular instrument was still used by General Franco in the 1970s this is a pretty mean instrument this is one where they put it around your neck and then they start screwing that screw in there not very nice thing\n\n(48:42) to do stocks of course thumb screws this instrument was particularly nasty they would hoist you up with your hands tied behind your back on a rope until you hang upside down in the air and then they would tie this huge Stone to your feet and throw it off a shelf and it would go and tear your arms out of their\n\n(49:07) sockets these are pretty terrible things that they did in the Inquisition and I know one needn't talk about these things but the cruelty of the system needs to be known Revelation 1211 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of the their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death just to\n\n(49:30) give us an idea what those poor Christians who stood for the word of God went through sometimes because they chose to believe it it's pretty horrendous isn't it pretty horrendous and these are some of the stakes that uh representations of the Inquisition where people died in their thousands in their hundreds and\n\n(49:54) thousands no in their Millions because of heras making a choice this is the Hugo French Hugo monument in southern Africa many of the hugos of France fled and they erected this Monument this representing the Trinity and here's a woman standing on the earth representing the Bride of God there she sits on the\n\n(50:23) earth she went down to Africa from Europe and in her one hand she has the Bible over there and in the other hand a chain she broke the chain which bound her to Rome and fled to the far off distant lands to Africa where she is now being slaughtered again but that's another story and fled to America and far off lands to get away\n\n(50:52) from the persecuting power of the 1,2 60 days great controversy says blackest in the black catalog of crime most horrible amongst the fish Deeds of all Dreadful centuries was St Bartholomew Massacre wow the king of France urged on by romish priests and prelates lent his sanction to the Dreadful work a bell was\n\n(51:18) placed in the middle of the night this Bell was told and then the slaughter began and 50,000 Protestants were murdered in one night by deception they said to them let's work together in future let's not fight anymore about all these things and the Protestants thought oh wonderful a kind word from Rome we can\n\n(51:44) relax we can work together and they went into an eism but meantime there was a plot and one night the belt told and the unsuspecting unguarded died in one night well the guns of the castle of St Angelo gave forth joyous salute in Rome the the bells rung in Joy Pope Gregory attended by his Cardinals and Priests led the\n\n(52:16) Magnificent procession to the Church of St Louie where the Cardinal of Lorraine chanted a tum they were so pleased that in one night they had slaughtered the French hugos and the pope had a metal struck here it is a medal with his name on the one side and on the other SES the word otum stres which means Slaughter of the\n\n(52:42) hugos They rejoiced isn't this a terrible thing that happened Deuteronomy 11:16 take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them and then the Lord's WTH be kindled against you and be shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not\n\n(53:04) her fruit unless you perish quickly from of the good land which the lord giveth you so if you turn away from the word of God and you take the law of God away then there will be dryness barrenness Revelation 11:7 and when they shall have finished their testimony this word of God the Beast that ascendeth out of the\n\n(53:34) bottomless pit will make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them now this over here as I have said before was a jacobine hat now what was a jacobine hat and who controlled the Jacobin well the founder of the Jacobin was a man by the name of Adam Vice now who was Adam Vice halp he was a Jesuit professor of canon law\n\n(54:08) isn't that interesting so the one who actually organized the French Revolution if you like was a Jesuit and he was the father of jacobinism he was also the founder of the Illuminati so a Jesuit founded the Illuminati and a Jesuit ran jacobinism which was responsible for the French Revolution here is inlad\n\n(54:37) University where he was Professor it's interesting that after the French Revolution the papacy had received a mortal wound and became insignificant in the eyes of many but in 19 29 the smallest state in the world was once again established so here was something that had received a wound and now it rose again so in 1929 gaspari\n\n(55:08) signed the lran treaty and the Vatican States came back into existence and the San Francisco Chronicle said musolini and gaspari Stein historic Roman PCT the Roman question tonight was a thing of the past and the Vatican was at peace with Italy in a fixing the autographs to the memorable document healing the wound\n\n(55:29) it's like that quoting from the Bible extreme cordiality was displayed on both sides fascinating story so a power seemed to have a mortal wound and then rose again now it's interesting that it only seemed to have a mortal wound deception is something that is inexplicable sometimes let me show you you some of\n\n(55:55) the later popes here is Anthony Se he was the first Grandmaster of Freemasonry in the London Lodge founded in 1717 remember this is the Forerunner time period uh leading up to this whole French Revolution time and these uh Freemasons stand like this with their hands on their stomachs with their finger pointing up well the pope himself\n\n(56:26) this is a picture of Pope Pas the 12 he had a stamp printed which is square and has Masonic symbolism on it where he stands on it like this as well it's interesting that the Vatican Bann Freemasonry but it's interesting too that if you want something not to be pinned to you then you ban it and practice it in secret but at the\n\n(56:55) Vatican itself The Lodges abounded and every Cardinal was a member interesting even while it was banned Revelation chapter 9 remember it told us and the fifth angel sounded and I saw a star fall from Heaven onto the Earth and to him was given the key to the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke\n\n(57:19) out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit so the light that Jesus gives will be darkened because of the smoke that's where it started in Revelation 12:3 we have another beast and there appeared another Wonder in heaven Behold a great red dragon having\n\n(57:44) seven heads 10 horns seven crowns upon his heads so in Revelation chapter 9 we have the smoke coming out in Revelation 11 this Beast comes out of the same bottomless pit so it grows this Darkness into an established Kingdom starts to grow the other powers in Revelation are this dragon with the seven heads with the crowns upon his\n\n(58:15) head we are told who he is we're told it's Satan who represents all the kingdoms of the Earth apparently and we are told in Revelation 129 that he is the one who was cast out that he is the devil and that he deceives the whole world all right and that he makes war with a woman in white which is the other\n\n(58:36) good church on Earth that represents the word of God there are other beasts in the Book of Revelation there's the lion with the two Wings which is an image from The Book of Daniel in Revelation 13 we have a beast that has the mouth of a lion then there is this leopard like beast in Revelation 13 these attributes\n\n(58:58) are also found there is a bear in Daniel 7 these attributes are also found in the Beast of Revelation 13 and then there's a teral be Beast that you don't know what really what it looks like so it's just an artist's impression and it has 10 horns and that you also find in Revelation 13 so these beasts are all\n\n(59:16) very interesting but they are represented as coming out of the sea okay then in Revelation 13 all the attributes of Daniel 7 are in this one conglomerate Beast that arises out of the sea we'll deal with them in detail Revelation 13 also has a beast out of the earth and that looks like maybe like this I don't know what it looked like\n\n(59:42) and in Revelation chapter 17 you have another Beast with a woman riding on it now let's read that 173 so he carried him away away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sitting upon a scar scet colored Beast full of the names of blasphemy it's against God having seven heads and 10 horns and verse 8 the Beast that thou\n\n(1:00:04) sawest was is not shall Ascend out of where Bottomless Pits and go into pedition aha that's interesting which other Beast came out of the bottomless pit the one in Revelation 11 right that makes war on God's people now is there a link here probably and who controls this Beast that comes from this bottomless\n\n(1:00:32) pit who rides it a woman a church rides it is it possible you think that the political systems on this Earth are being run by a woman and we don't really know it because she has concealed herself in Mystery in secrecy and you don't really see it you don't know it but it's actually happened you think think it's\n\n(1:00:55) possible do you think that this power this church might have used its agents to pretend to kill her when actually they control the world through its agencies through the secret societies of the world which was started by none other than Vice halp who was a what a Jesuit is it possible illuminism what is\n\n(1:01:23) illuminism where does it lead us is it possible that this war against the word and those that represent the word the church are going to come into conflict with this new political entity that has a new standard which is called human rights think it's possible do you think so wow you know there is one author who\n\n(1:01:48) 150 years ago wrote on these issues and I'm going to quote this author now but the point is not whether this is right or whether it's wrong it's just what was perceived at that stage and compared to what the occult World said at exactly the same time we will be doing this we will be comparing what this Source said with what the\n\n(1:02:16) occultists themselves said at exactly the same time period and we will see something fascinating so if you will bear with me without further identification I would like to read some of these things that were seen to be correct at that stage 150 years ago when all these things were happening you know\n\n(1:02:37) the French Revolution and all these things Vari by a variety of images the Lord Jesus represented to John that's now in the Revelation the wicked character and seductive influence of those who have been distinguished for the persecution of God's people God's representation of the detestable works of the inhabitants of\n\n(1:02:57) the ruling powers of the world who bind themselves into secret societies and confederacies not honoring the law of God should enable the people who have the light of Truth to keep clear of these evils H so 150 years ago already they perceived that wow secret societies were going to play an important role so to John the wicked\n\n(1:03:22) character of these seductive influen was shown by those who distinguish themselves for the persecution of God's people now who are they this terrible picture drawn by John is to show how completely the powers of Earth will give themselves over to evil and should show that those who have received the truth how dangerous it is\n\n(1:03:46) to link up with secret societies or to join them this is fascinating stuff fascinating stuff the ruling powers of the world who bind themselves in secret societies and confederacies and they will not keep the Commandments of God they will have another standards here's a text then quoted by the prophet Isaiah which I read to you\n\n(1:04:10) Isaiah in chapter 8: 9-13 says associate yourselves oh ye people and you shall be broken in pieces in other words make these confederacies behind the scenes come on plan together as a world to overcome truth oh you people and you shall be broken give ear and you of you of far countries guard yourselves and\n\n(1:04:32) you shall be broken guard yourselves and you shall be broken take counsel together it shall come to not speak the word it shall not stand for God Is With Us these people are saying God is with us we're doing the right thing for the Lord spoke thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that I should not walk\n\n(1:04:51) in the way of the people saying say ye not a Confederate FY to all them to whom this people shall say A Confederacy neither fear ye Their Fear nor be afraid sanctify the Lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread aha so Isaiah is predicting that the world will Confederate and say the Lord is in this\n\n(1:05:14) we're working together as a group and uh we're doing the right thing and this is the best thing to do but they're leaving God out of it and it will not work then this writer applies this and says there are those who question whether it's right for Christians to belong to Freemasons and other secret societies\n\n(1:05:35) let all such consider the scriptures just quoted if we are Christians at all we must be Christians everywhere and must consider and heed the counsel given to make us Christians according to the standard of God's word it's fascinating so isn't it important that we have a look at what the Freemasons actually\n\n(1:05:52) teach or maybe even more interesting who founded the Freemasons who controls them what do they teach do they actually preach against Jesus and the word of God do they make war on the word of God yes or no these are questions we need to ask ourselves the UN christlikeness of the whole Confederacy will be seen in the\n\n(1:06:18) secret societies because they serve Gods as senseless and powerless to bless as the gods of the Hindus interesting those who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel cannot be United with Freemasons or any other Oran secret organization Christ is not divided I agree with that none can be bound up with them and\n\n(1:06:43) be free men before Gods wow interesting Christians must sever every tie that bind them to the secret orders that are not under the control of God we cannot belong to secret societies this was written 150 years ago and then one thing I do know those who remain in connection with them will be burned up\n\n(1:07:07) with a bundles of Tears interesting statements satanic agencies are in every city busily organizing into parties those opposed to the law of God we cannot afford to be off our God and then one of the fans of the secret societies is to form gigantic monopolies gigantic monopolies will be formed a few\n\n(1:07:31) men will combine to grasp all the means to be obtained in certain lines of business do we see that today by the way do we see gigantic monopolies being formed forcing the little man right out of Industry so that you will be subjected to their power yes or no and if you do not do their bidding you will\n\n(1:07:50) not be able to prosper do we see Mega mergers yes or no you cannot open a newspaper today without reading about Mega mergers right or wrong it sounds good but do you know that your freedom is being eroded Peace by piece until you are nothing better than a slave and if you should dare open your mouth well we'll take your job away in\n\n(1:08:18) your industry and you will not be able to buy or sell trade unions will be one of the agencies that will bring upon this Earth a time of trouble such has not been since the world began people don't believe that I believe it I have had the unfortunate experience of standing on the other side of trade\n\n(1:08:39) unions when they go berserk have you ever seen that it's kind of scary in Africa where I live trade unions are very powerful and Trade union sounds like a good thing and it's course guaranteed by human rights to have trade unions because you are allowed to fight for your rights but think about it if the cake is\n\n(1:09:03) X big and I fight for a bigger slice what does that do to the slice of my neighbor it makes his slice smaller right or wrong am I loving my neighbor as myself when I make his slice smaller so that mine can become bigger yes or no I don't think so and what if it comes to the point to where you do not want to\n\n(1:09:31) slice up the slice well then you just take your slice I've stood on the other side of this I've had my ribs broken by trade unionists they were using the universities to bring their points across to governments they declared a boycott of all University classes and students were deprived of their education that means that the student\n\n(1:09:59) can miss a whole year having paid for his tuition and then lose everything so the university decreed classes go on so I was the professor I said classes go on and then the Trade union caught us with a class in progress and I went and stood in front of the doors and I said sorry you cannot go in here it's I who gave permission to the\n\n(1:10:26) students to be taught in there I'm responsible not them and then they started crushing me and they broke my ribs and the riot police were all around and they did they lift a finger no I have proof of this I was on the front page of every newspaper in that country and uh nothing happen the students didn't get their way they then\n\n(1:10:50) left fortunately for some reason they left maybe there is power in the power of prayer they went to another place and they smashed everything including the poor students beat them up terribly my students escaped that day by the grace of God I've stood in a building where trade unions were negotiating for\n\n(1:11:11) something that was not in the power of those who they were negotiating with to give and so they started rhythmically smashing against the building as only a Amer an can do and this whole glass building exploded unbelievable came down like a shower of glass and uh Terrible Things the destruction that you see one of the\n\n(1:11:36) agencies to bring about the time of trouble the L labor unions are not from God those who bind themselves together with secret societies stay away from them this was written many years ago in Revelation 11:15 and the seventh angel sounded and the there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world have\n\n(1:11:58) become the kingdoms of our Lords and of his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the 4 and 20 Elders which sat before God in on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped God saying we give thee thanks oh Lord God Almighty which art and was and art to come because thou H has taken to thee\n\n(1:12:21) thy great power and has reigned so the good news is that in spite of this power that starts off first in Revelation chapter 9 opening up the pits of Hell to bring about doctrines in the world which darken the light and bring Darkness over the Earth grows eventually through history by the time we get to the time of the\n\n(1:12:51) French Revolution the of hell are opened up again and a power arises which is to become a universal political power which will be controlled by a woman by a church which will replace the word of God and substitute it with its own standard its own EA does that make sense and it looks good good on paper but\n\n(1:13:26) actually violates every principle of the word of God every principle of the Ten Commandments is violated and it is difficult to see because it looks so good but as we continue with the lectures you will see that this is really the case if you take just the first commandment which says I am the Lord your God you shall have no\n\n(1:13:53) no other gods beside me well there were countries that honored that or whatever if you're going to have a universal free for all with everybody accepted that would have to go in fact it would have to then say you will have all other gods besides me right or wrong you will have to tolerate idolatry or else you're in trouble\n\n(1:14:24) when it comes to blasphemy isn't it fascinating that when you switch on the television only one God is blasphemed have you noticed that only one God is blasphemed none of the others this I always find very fascinating I went to write to the Human Rights Commission and say you know in the interest of fairness and equality\n\n(1:14:44) should not all gods be equally blasphemed couldn't you spread it around a little bit in the interest of fairness I wonder how they would react I wonder how the Muslim world would react if that was done that was that is being done to Jesus Christ on the television every single day I wonder how they would react if the same was done in\n\n(1:15:08) terms of their religion or the Buddhist religion or the Hindu religion or any other religion on the face of the Earth if we wanted equality of everyone what about the fifth commandment honor your father and your mother no the children today have to be re-educated to other standards to become citizens of the world which means that\n\n(1:15:29) they must stop honoring their father and mother and start honoring the system did they do that in communism what did they do in communism When the Children wanted to cling to the Norms of the parents what did they do to them they took them away and re-educated them they taught them not to honor their\n\n(1:15:46) father and their mother isn't that sad Thou shalt not kill wow that Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not bring false testimony are these things being tolerated of course Jesus will one day invite everyone into his kingdom in his kingdom there will be righteousness and truth and there will be no more lie the\n\n(1:16:14) standards will be the standards that he has set and that appli to everything and the nations were angry and thy WTH is come and the time of the Dead that they should be judged and that thou should give reward unto the servants the prophets and to the Saints and them that fear thy name small and great and should destroy them which\n\n(1:16:33) destroy the Earth isn't that interesting and the temple of God was opened in heaven where in Revelation chap 11 and there was seen in his Temple the Ark of the Testament where is Jesus in which chamber in the most holy wow we have moved from a time of ministration in the first chamber to ministration in the\n\n(1:17:05) second chamber which is judgment and the Ark of the testimony The Ten Commandments are the universal standard of what is right and what is wrong there's no doubt about that and we see that that testimony and this means time is up and there were Lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail this is\n\n(1:17:34) the story of the last plague on earth and the kingdom of God becomes the kingdom of Earth as well so Jesus the great high priest is seen in front of the Ark of the testimony that is the true standard not the AA controlled by a woman and no matter how many stalk like birds unclean spirits Elevate the standard for the\n\n(1:18:08) world to accept it's contrary to the word of God as we saw up to now this church is defined unfortunately it's the one that rules for for 1,260 days it is the Church of the Middle Ages it is the Roman Church and I cannot change it I was one myself and I'm so grateful for the word of God for having shown me these\n\n(1:18:41) things and behind it all behind this French Revolution and all of these we see the agencies of this church we see Jesuit agencies behind it all and we've seen that secret societies because everything is shrouded in mystery will bring about the changes which will make none Andoid the word of God so in the next\n\n(1:19:07) lectures we're going to go behind the scenes and open up some facts to see if this really is so but even if it is so which I assume is so Jesus is in control and he's permitted us to see all these things and he is the officiating high priest he is the king of kings he will come again in glory and no matter how\n\n(1:19:33) much darkness comes out of the bottomless pit Jesus is in control and there's nothing to fear cling to him and nobody will be lost thank [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:211_the_secret_behind_secret_societies_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSecret Societies' Deception,Roman Church's Power,Jesuit Control,World Domination,New World Order\n\n## Guide:\nThis source delves into the secretive history and alleged influence of the Jesuit order and its purported control over numerous global institutions and events. The speaker, Walter Veith, argues that the Roman Catholic Church, specifically through the Jesuits, orchestrates a \"New World Order\" by covertly manipulating secret societies like Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, and the Illuminati. Veith claims these groups, along with various political and financial entities, share a hidden Luciferian or pagan doctrine veiled beneath exoteric Christian teachings, ultimately aiming for universal temporal dominion under the Pope. He presents historical accounts and interpretations of symbols to support his assertion that the Jesuits instigate conflicts, control governments, and seek to destroy Protestantism, with the ultimate goal of establishing a global totalitarian system where individual liberties are abolished.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 211 - The Secret Behind Secret Societies / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMkfyiqzi0w\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the secret behind secret societies obviously the secret behind secret societies is a secret that people don't want to spread abroad Revelation 1774 and the woman was arrayed in purple and Scarlet colors and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having the golden cup\n\n(01:27) in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of Earth of fornication there's only one Church in the whole world that uses a woman with a cup and that is the Roman Church and uh here is City sit Del vaticano using the woman with the golden cup and she is called fides on all their documents fides now\n\n(01:53) what does that mean fides well let's go to a mason Source a very good Masonic Source written by Albert G Macky the manual of the lodge Albert Macky was a 33 degree Freemason it'll become clear as we go through the lectures what this means and he says the right hand has in all ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity and our ancient\n\n(02:18) bre Brethren worshiped deity under the name of fides or Fidelity which was sometimes represented by two right hands joined and sometimes by two figures holding each other by the right hand Numa was the first who erected the altar to fides under which the name the godes of Oaths and honesty was worshiped so it means\n\n(02:43) honesty and Fidelity but it is also an image of a female deity now Revelation 17:5 calls this institution the mother of prostitutes in Revelation 18:7 she says I sit as Queen I am not a widow and I will never mourn so she might have lost some children during the Reformation but she's going to get them back I am and\n\n(03:11) there is none beside me I will never be a widow or suffer loss of children she's going to control the world in a spiritual sense that's what this power says now it's interesting that the Vatican has just recently September 5th 2000 issued this encyclical Dominus eus where she says other churches are no\n\n(03:34) sisters of ours the Vatican insists it must always be clear that the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic universal church is not the sister but the mother of all the churches Cardinal ratzinger said that he's the head of the Inquisition they don't call themselves the Inquisition anymore they call themselves the congregation for Doctrine\n\n(03:54) and Faith but it's the same thing it's even in the same building now she's not the mother she is not the sister but the mother of all the churches that means all the other churches are subject to her right or wrong that's what she says now in Revelation 13:1 and 2 speaking about the same power it says and the\n\n(04:18) dragon gave him his power and his seat in great Authority now that's a very wow statement the dragon gave him the power in other words this power comes from another source now doesn't Catholicism preach Christianity yes it does doesn't it preach Jesus Christ as the savior of the world yes it does but it also preaches\n\n(04:44) mediation through other mechanisms and through the church now it is interesting that in secret societies there are always two doctrines one for the initiated and one for the goyam the uninitiated and the Knights Templars had two doctrines the one was the inside esoteric occult Doctrine and the other\n\n(05:11) one was the exoteric the one to the outside and that was Catholicism so the masses received a religion which the Insiders turned on its head amongst occult insiders Lucifer is the true Son of God Jesus is a second son who was defeated by the first one who had been thrown out so Lucifer is the true luminary the Victor in the battle and\n\n(05:46) will be the one who will be worshiped at the end of time that is occult Doctrine that's always been the doctrine of the cabala the cabalist doctrine and it has been the doctrine of noos ISM but of course it's not what the Bible teaches but then Catholicism doesn't teach what the Bible teaches either Revelation\n\n(06:10) 17: 12-4 talks about 10 horns you saw or 10 Kings who have not yet received the kingdom but who for one hour will receive Authority as kings along with the Beast they have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the Beast and they will make war against the lamb but the lamb will overcome them\n\n(06:31) because he's Lord of lords and king of kings and with him will be his called Chosen and faithful followers now we're going to deal with whole chapter of Revelation 17 at a later stage but the kings of the world here represented by these 10 will give their power to the system just like in the Middle Ages and\n\n(06:50) enforce the doctrines on an entire world very interesting this will be this beast from the bottomless pit now har H car in his work on root to Global occupation puts it this way he says there were the ancient mystery religions which come from Babylon and uh they were pantheistic of course which means God is in nature God\n\n(07:16) is in everything which in in effect makes us God then too this was inculcated in cabalism was taken over in the Christian era in what is called NOS itic ISM and the Knights Templars were the inner secret core that had the ancient knowledge of the mystics this was carried further through Rosicrucianism Freemasonry and the\n\n(07:46) Illuminati which according to Gary car controls Marxism American European secret societies and political societies International Banking and the World Council of churches now that sounds very strange is the world CH Council of churches controlled by Freemasonry we'll have to look into that in some detail\n\n(08:06) then of course you have the entire New Age movement the theosophical societies the many Cults and all these things are all controlled by this mechanism to make null and void the doctrine of salvation In Christ Alone that will be the final battle and in order to achieve this this woman has concealed herself\n\n(08:30) and has hid herself in a Garb of Christianity and people receive the goam doctrine and do not know what the inner core Doctrine is that is quite something well if we look at 1 Chronicles 16: 26 for all the gods of the people are Idols but the Lord made the heavens tells us that idolatry is quite something that's Rife on the earth\n\n(08:58) and uh Nimrod the Lord of Heaven tamuz the Pagan Messiah and semiramis the Queen of Heaven these are find their origin in Babylon and if you go through all the religions that were that were propagated in Lebanon PHA Babylon Assyria Greece Rome Egypt India China Mexico Scandinavia you have only this same picture under different names Bal\n\n(09:24) tamuz ashet Al bakos asarta BOS tamuz Isa nus Hercules belus etc etc in Egypt Osiris or Horus Isis hat India Vishnu Krishna I or daki and so on and so on now romanism the Roman Church has taken this Trinity and made it father mother child which means that they must Elevate the female to the point of deity and\n\n(09:56) we'll see how they did that and how they are doing that with the sanction of the Pope so the true Trinity and the Roman Catholic Trinity are two different things for the goam it's Father Son and Holy Spirit for the Inner Circle it's father mother child which is none other than balus and aset if you want to take\n\n(10:19) it back to those times Jupiter is the god who is worshiped under Petrus The Rock and UB Petri where Peter is there is the church so here's another rock which takes the place of the true Rock Christianity and the secret societies we could this summarize it as follows the old Babylonian religion gave rise to\n\n(10:50) cabalism Via their scenes and others nosism came into existence and nostic ISM was founded by Dion magas this comes from no other source than history Lami and by elifas Levi wow that's a high Masonic source so gnosticism founded by Simon Magus then this gnosticism with its secret Doctrine was eventually over time through many\n\n(11:21) intermediary organizations carried over to the Knights Templars and the Knights Templars were a group of a Roman Catholic order if you like that were set over the temple site to protect it and they had strong licks to Islamic societies the ismaelis the karmatit the faites the dues and the assassins and these are very very\n\n(11:48) interesting and we'll be dealing with them when we talk about the Islamic connection what the secret societies actually teach just like the Templars had two doctrines one for the goam the uninitiated and one for the Insiders and the two diametrically opposed to each other so the secret societies of Islam\n\n(12:09) do exactly the same thing but that's another lecture now the Templars they had their secret inner information inculcated in the rosic crucians and the Jesuits the Jesuits again formed and created Freemasonry and Freemason was created as the Protestant arm of the Roman Catholic Church unbeknown to them\n\n(12:35) beguiled fooled if you like into doing the work that Rome wanted them to do so that Rome could sit in the background while Freemasonry did it for them and then it wasn't them it was them and it was mainly Protestants that were doing it and not Rome very clever very very clever indeed so now let's have a look\n\n(12:59) at these Knights Templars here are some of the presentations representations this is deoy uh the founder of the or not the founder but the leader at the time of its uh dissolution of the kns Templars this is what their dress looked like if you like and that is one of their symbols it is a symbol that is used by many churches\n\n(13:25) today did you know that many charismatic churches use that that symbol that's fascinating and uh Jehovah's Witnesses used that symbol as well we'll come to that in another lecture now let's have a look at what Nesta Webster secret societies and subversive movements has to say about the Templars we're not\n\n(13:47) going to read it all but uh you can always if you get the video stop the quote in the year 1118 19 years after the first crusade ended with the defeat of the Muslims the capture of Antioch and Jerusalem these groups were founded that were eventually established as the Templars and they presented them with a house near the\n\n(14:11) site of the Temple of Solomon hence their name Knights templers and they became very famous and a very powerful order which controlled all the finances the financial World they were the banking Elite of the world if you like and then in the the year 1128 the order was sanctioned by the Council of troes and by the pope it was\n\n(14:36) a Roman Catholic order within the church now some years later October 1337 this order was officially brought to an end by the king of France because it had come to light what they were doing so it was said the king of France Philip leel had the Templars arrested and the date was Friday the 13th October\n\n(15:07) 1307 and since that day Friday the 13 is a day of bad luck for the entire world and the charges brought against them were the ceremony of initiation into the order was accomplished by insults to the cross and the denial of Christ and gross obscenities gross obscenities there were all kinds of things reminiscent of Sodom\n\n(15:32) that had to take place there the Adoration of an idol which was said to be the image of the true God and that was ba forat this symbol over here of the androgenic male female deity the omission of the words of the consecration of the mass the right that laay Chiefs amongst themselves giving Absolution and authorization of\n\n(15:53) unnatural Vice so they had to to curse the cross trample Upon Jesus swear allegiance to buffet and sanction this with unusual Vice that's a pretty serious crime in those days so he was sentenced to death but the order actually didn't disappear the pope was very reluctant to say that it was so Masonic ritual includes\n\n(16:18) references to the Knights Templars for example here secret societies and sub nervous movement says several Knights who had set forth the rescue of the holy places of Palestine from the sarasin formed an association under the name of Freemasons thus indicating that their principal desire was the re reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon\n\n(16:39) and you hear a lot about the Reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon today and the story of Israel and all those interesting things now let's go a little bit into some of the history I'm taking you to this beautiful palace where do you think it is it's in Jerusalem and it's not Vatican and this is where the pope has\n\n(17:03) his representation in Jerusalem it's a palace for a king there's the Vatican flag flying outside and uh there's even a whole Lane where you have some interesting paple artifacts now in Jerusalem I went to look up the site of the knights and here is the knight's Palace the Latin patriarch this is where\n\n(17:29) the Knights Templars originally had a site and the Knights of the papacy now control this area this is their symbol that they use that is also the knight's shield which is used by many religions today the Rema Church uses that symbol for example these are uh the Eternal Warriors that is the symbol that they\n\n(17:52) use there they are being they kiss the pope or the patriarch's uh ring they are knighted just like Knights and they Knight highly prominent bankers and individuals such as that inside this church you have of course the stature of Jupiter as Peter notice that the foot is well kissed and uh I I didn't want to\n\n(18:16) kiss the foot so I just stood there and it is a very important church because both Pope Paul I 6 and Pope John Paul II visited this church which is of course highly symbolic and there are the plaques and uh the Latin patriarch the knights Palace if you go inside there's this interesting Altar and as you look\n\n(18:39) at the altar you'll see certain figures over here this one over here is very interesting let me get it a little bit closer and what do you see you see the double-headed Eagle which is also the symbol that is used in Freemasonry so there it is on the altar of the knights and what is there on this side\n\n(19:01) two swords held like a compass fascinating so there are many many Masonic fig figures in here the tail feathers and the feathers of the eagle very reminiscent of what you have for example on the back of the dollar and all those other interesting symbols of the circle with the triangle and the sun around it and uh the inheritor of\n\n(19:24) the Templar uh Nuance are the the Jesuits now the Jesuits of course are the ones who behind the scenes control many things they were founded on the 15th of August 1534 by ignasius laala and were sanctioned by the pope on the 27th of September 1540 so they were created as it were to stand against the Reformation they were\n\n(19:57) designed to to destroy the Reformation Lola wanted the order to be champions of Catholic unity and uh of course submission to Christ's Vicor the pope was absolutely essential here you have the institution of Lola's organization by the pope uh on this particular day and there are some interesting analogies which we will find\n\n(20:26) here here for example there's cons considerable analogy between Masonic and jesuitic degrees and the Jesuits also tread down the shoe and bear the knee because ignasius Lola thus presented himself at Rome and asked for the confirmation of the order now who existed first Freemasons or the Jesuits the Jesuits existed first of\n\n(20:50) course they were to obey as a corpse per aava the reconstitutions repeat 500 times that one must see Christ in the person of the general and even if God gave you a dog you must obey him as though he were Jesus Christ himself Lala's statue in a Jesuit Retreat Lola in Vision the Society of Jesus constituted in the chapel notredam n\n\n(21:18) 1534 now the Chapel of the Sacred Heart in Paris many many occult incrustations and this is the famous Jesuit Oak that each Jesuit makes when he becomes a Jesuit now it'll tell us something about the character of the Jesuits there it says I and he fills in his name and the presence of God and all the saints and\n\n(21:40) all these things swear that his Holiness the pope is Christ's Vice Regent and is the true and only head of the Catholic Universal Church Etc It also says here that this power was given by the Savior Jesus Christ he has power to dis oppose heretical Kings princes States commonwealths governments all being\n\n(22:04) illegal without his sacred confirmation and that they may safely be destroyed so a Jesuit swears that if a government is not subject to Rome it can be what destroyed I further declare that uh I will help and assist and advise all or any of his Holiness agents uh wherever I shall be and do my utmost to exate the\n\n(22:27) heretical Protestant or liberal doctrines liberal doctrines are doctrines where you decide what you believe you take the liberty of making your own choice rather than allowing the pope to do it for you and that will be destroyed and all their pretended powers and that it doesn't matter where you send me in the world I will\n\n(22:49) obey and I promise that I will have no opinion of my own I will obey like a corpse and I will make war secretly or openly against all headed itics Protestants and liberals as I am directed to do to exate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth I will spare neither sex age nor condition\n\n(23:07) and I will hang waste boil Flay strangle bury alive these Infamous Heretics rip up the stomachs and WBS of their women Crush their infants heads against the wall in order to annihilate forever their excal race that's a quite a nice Christian promise would you agree very Christian promise did they do\n\n(23:25) it well the valenzas They smash the children's heads against the rocks to make the parents resent in the Ottoman Empire that's an interesting story in Serbia and in um all those East block countries where they occupied they took the children threw them in the air and caught them on the ends of their bayonets they were\n\n(23:49) they were nice people now you will say that was Islam that wasn't Jesuits well debatable we'll talk about it another time and uh if I cannot do it openly I will do it secretly so that is what a Jesuit swears this is the famous pontifical Gregorian University in Rome the most prestigious Catholic University\n\n(24:10) in the world the Jesuits in all their enclaves have their figures in caves now in paganism all the deities come out of the cave and they have the letters IHS which actually stand for Isis Horus set which is the Egyptian Trinity they of course say it means hom salvat Jesus the savior of men but it doesn't it means IHS is\n\n(24:36) hor and their symbol is the triangle with the allseeing eye in it for this deity they also use the pillar uh the Stella if you like they have the symbol of the triangle with the ey in a circle which is also the symbol used in the New Age movement and we've saw that Gary car says that Freemasonry controls the New Age movement and the\n\n(25:03) Jesuits control the Freemasonry or created it this is the uh University of the Jesuits in Prague on top of it they have Atlas not Jesus Christ if you go to a more modern Jesuit Enclave like this one in Germany I visited this I'm quite cheeky sometimes there I am and took a picture and inside they have this\n\n(25:25) picture of Christ This is not Christ this is atlas holding the world on top of his shoulders disguised they have these symbols up against the wall there this symbol is the symbol of Hermes if you take away uh the cross then you have the symbol of Isis this is paganism at its best and these symbols over here are\n\n(25:49) nothing here it is Jesuit K here when it was built Etc and their symbolism Maria the m is the Masonic M the triangle Aria the goddess here is a church in Germany a cathedral inside you will see this circle with a cross in it the Crossed Swords symbol of all symbols used also in Freemasonry now if you go back to\n\n(26:16) ancient Assyria that was a very prominent cross it was the males cross it comes from ancient paganism they have the symbols of this this star over here two star one over the other or two crosses one over the other they have the compass they have the moon with a dis in it or a star in it which is the symbol\n\n(26:37) that Islam uses for example they have the solar calendar and the Triple Crown all of these are used by the papacy upside down crosses represent victory over Christ Hammers and Compasses and sickles these are symbols that are prevalent in the world there's Jesus standing above the skull and crossbow which is a symbol of Jupiter the god\n\n(27:01) Jupiter uh who is a symbol of course who is Lucifer upside down crosses again this is a very U important cathedral in Europe in Germany where all the political leaders come together if you go there you will have Janos the two-headed one and then you have the statue so called of David but of course it isn't David it is the god pan because\n\n(27:26) he has a pan flute in his hand then David didn't play a pan flute so I went to look for the Dark Side of pan because there's a light side and a dark side and I found them there he is the hoofed one in the same Cathedral so they hide their occult symbolism if you enter into the hallway you find this over here this is\n\n(27:45) the god of nubis it's got nothing to do with Christianity there you have him as well plus you have the phix rising from the ashes plus you have the symbol of Jupiter and a whole host of other symbols over there and in their side Chapel you have all the signs of the zodiac serving the V various deities\n\n(28:04) like Mars and Aquarius Etc and the door knob is a yingyang this has nothing to do with Christianity they use the symbol of the compass and Jupiter and the PX symbol over there which you will find in virtually every single Christian denomination upon the face of the Earth the phix rising from the ashes\n\n(28:28) the peacock all symbols of Lucifer here you have the PX with a circle with a dot in it and you say to yourself but isn't that a symbol of Christianity no this is a symbol of Horus this has got nothing to do with Christianity they use pine cones let's ask Albert Macky 33 degree Freemason to tell us what the symbol means the point\n\n(28:51) within the circle is an interesting and important symbol in Freemasonry the symbol is really a beautiful but somewhat obuse illustion to the old Sun worship and in introduces us for the first time to that modification of it among the Ancients the worship of the phace so it's a pretty filthy symbol at\n\n(29:08) that it deals with male organs wow so that comes from the horse's mouth so that's what it means now what's the PX mean let's go to the best Masonic Source in the world morals and Dogma page 292 and in case you don't believe me I photocopied it so that you can see it there you can see the symbol can you see\n\n(29:29) that it is the staff of of Osiris on the medal of constantinus in hognut Eris whatever the inscriptions and then some other interesting things so this is the staff of Osiris and then he goes through the Mystic Tow and the crosses and the stars of David and then he uses this one as well interesting symbol he says the\n\n(29:54) vestment of the priest of Horus were covered with these crosses that's a males cross remember that I showed it to you on the Assyrian King now who wears that on his vestment well let's have a look oops there it is who's wearing it the pope is wearing it so what is he he must be the priest of Horus so to the\n\n(30:17) outside world it seems like Christianity but to the Inner Circle it's occultism on the floor of the the Cathedral in London you have the trick which is the triple Ling Yang and what does that mean well let's go and ask the sourcers themselves Celtic version of the yingyang that's what it is the trick\n\n(30:39) the sea good luck cauldron Celtic goddess the goddess of wisdom and Witchcraft who was enthroned in the French Revolution goddess of Reason witchcraft reason all these things same deity on the floor of the same Cathedral you find the towel what does the tow represent let's ask another Mason ward he says it's the symbol of the male\n\n(31:05) creative side of the deity sign language of the Mysteries so again it has a sexual connotation what's it doing on the floor of a cathedral so the Jesuits are the HS of the occult religion and they control the world through their agencies they stand in the background create suborganization and everybody thinks they are not active\n\n(31:31) let's ask them themselves what they believe here is the history of the general of the Society of Jesus these are all the generals starting with ignasius Lola they're all listed down there we don't have to go through them all all the way through to the present one that rules now whose name is PETA H kenb nice\n\n(31:55) German name it's interesting that the Germans are very prominent in this pet Hans kolvenbach is the head of the of the Jesuits Cardinal ringa another German is the head of the Inquisition they seem to be pretty much in control what does he look like there he is PETA HT kenbar you're looking probably at one of\n\n(32:18) the mightiest men's on the Earth today if not the mightiest he's the black pope here you have this Cave of Lala here you have have George W bush and the pope uh in audience with each other and they don't do anything in by chance they just happen to do this exactly under that picture I showed you where Lola\n\n(32:43) receives his commission from the pope now the ceremony of induction and the Extreme Oath of the Jesuits Library of Congress catalac card there it is you have been taught to insidiously plant the seeds of jealousy and hatred between communities provinces and states that were at peace and incite them to Deeds\n\n(33:02) of blood involving them in war with each other and to create revolutions and civil wars in countries that were independent and prosperous cultivating the art and the sciences and enjoying the blessings of peace to take sides with the combatants and to act secretly in conact with your brother Jesuit who\n\n(33:21) might be engaged on the other side but openly opposed to that with which you might be connected only that the church may be the gainer in the end in the conditions fixed in the treaties for peace and that the end justifies the means whoa this is hegelian science two opposing viewpoints dlec thinking you War the one\n\n(33:47) with the other and you rub them up until nothing is left it's called thesis antithesis and the resulting Clash break synthesis that which you want now note that the Jesuit can be very active on the one side but he can be equally active on the other side so this is all a process whereby they wish to attain\n\n(34:13) things the 30-year War what was that about the aim and the object was that that war should in truth become a war of annihilation besides was it possible for them to allow peace to be concluded with countries whose rebellious governments had issued a law ruling that no Jesuit should ever gain dare to show his face do you know that\n\n(34:33) the Jesuits were thrown out of virtually all countries including Catholic ones because they were so divisive Catholic Kings couldn't even take the Jesuits and threw them out if a Catholic King dared to throw out a Jesuit that country was destroyed Catholic or not and the Jesuits are back you can take your bottom dollar for that\n\n(34:54) so the frightful responsibility for the terrible 30 years war must rest upon the emperor Ferdinand 2 and his teachers rulers and bosom friends the sons of Lola every single thing I'm saying is a quote poery an enemy to civil religious liberty in 1550 Pope Julius declared his claim to Universal temporal political\n\n(35:21) power evidenced by a new coin he issued its motto having read the nation and Kingdom that will not serve me Shall Perish now please note that this is a Roman Catholic statement that the nation and the kingdom that does not serve the papacy will perish what does that mean in terms of protestant countries then\n\n(35:43) are they going to be in trouble yes or no I would say yes they will be in trouble Thomas ainus the great um philosopher of the Roman Catholic Church said the pope by Divine Right has spiritual and temporal power as Supreme king of the world the pope of Rome as head of the papal government claims absolute\n\n(36:09) sovereignty and Supremacy over all the governments of the Earth all the governments all these quotes are highly potent quotes there is nothing mediocre in these quotes and they come from the highest highest sources the right of deposing kings is is inherent in the Supreme pover sovereignty which the pope\n\n(36:30) as Vice region of Christ exercise over all Christian nations Cardinal Henry Manning 1892 he was Archbishop of man man of Westminster so he is in control of all nations of the world now it's interesting that uh the Bible tells us that these words were put on the Christ uh cross at the CR crucifixion Jesus of\n\n(36:55) Nazareth the king of the Je you read that in John 19:19 but the Roman Catholic crucifix has the words INRI written on it now if you look it up in Webster's Dictionary it means yesus nazarenos re udum but in the Extreme Oath of the Jesuits INRI means something totally different it means impos which means it is just to\n\n(37:22) exterminate or annihilate impire or heretical Kings governments or rulers that's an interesting point now another thing that they want to do is destroy protestantism we cherish at the bottom of our hearts this principle that whatever does not Unite with us must be annihilated and we hold ourselves ready to make as soon as we\n\n(37:44) shall have the means and energetic application of these principle protestantism is already already wearing out and sinking to deay Decay yes we are destined to insult its last agonies to March over its broken skeleton and Scattered bones oh let us hasten this desolution by our strong and United efforts then already they wrote\n\n(38:10) protestantism is becoming decomposed and we are gaining men of note this is extracts from the secret plan uh those are the worst of the Catholics the inquisitors the Jesuits they are simply the romish Army for the Earthly sovereignty of the world in the future with a pontiff of Rome for Emperor something like a universal surf\n\n(38:35) them with them as Master is what is being planned that's all they stand for they don't even believe in God perhaps the brothers kmas uh all these quotes the general of the Jesuits insists on being Master Sovereign of sovereigns wherever the Jesuits are admitted they will be Master cost what it may the society is by nature dictatorial and\n\n(39:01) therefore it is the irreconcilable enemy of all constituted Authority 50 years in the Church of Rome written by father chenik King ignasius Lola says himself the power of the general be will be so unlimited that should he deem it necessary for the honor of God he shall even be able to send back or in another\n\n(39:23) Direction those who have come direct from the popes so this is a powerful order frederi V harenberg said never before in the course of the world's history as such a society appeared the old Roman senate itself did not lay schemes for world domination with greater certainty of success they want World Dominion with the Pope enthroned\n\n(39:50) as the universal ruler the Roman Catholic Lafayette said it is my opinion that it is that if the Liberties of this country the United States of America are destroyed it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests for they are the most crafty dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty\n\n(40:11) they have instigated most of the wars of Europe these are prominent people speaking Moss he's the founder of the Moss code the inventor of the MOS code he said and who are these agents they are for the most part Jesuits and ecclesiastical or order proverbial through the world for cunning duplicity and total want of moral principle and\n\n(40:34) order so skilled in all the Arts of deception that even in Catholic countries in Italy itself it became intolerable and the people required its suppression that's another prominent man Arch Duke Maxim Al Francis said they have so constantly mixed themselves up in the courton state intrigues that they\n\n(40:53) must in Justice be reproached with striving of the univ ival dominion and we could go on and on and on this is a very interesting one this is Michael angilo Tambour 1720 this is the Jesuit of the general of the Jesuits the general speaking to the Duke of branas and he said the following see my Lord from this room from this room I\n\n(41:20) govern not only Paris but China not only China but the whole world without any one knowing how is managed interesting this is what the Jesuits themselves had to say the Pope's Confessor has to be a Jesuit and the pope himself has to come to a Jesuit to confess the Vatican Empire there all everything I say is a\n\n(41:47) quote this here is Jean Baptist Janssen he ruled from 1946 to 1964 and uh he looks like a Charming gentleman very cheerful uh but uh nevertheless you can see that this Photograph was taken from the Saturday evening post 1959 and this is what he is in command of and now we will want to deal with these issues in the next session he\n\n(42:22) controls the following secret societies The Sovereign military or Order of Malta so he is in control of the Knights of Malta the Scottish right Shrine of Freemasonry the order of the Illuminati the Knights of Columbus the Knights of the klooks clan benit the Nation of Islam and its private Army called the\n\n(42:43) fruit of Islam the mafia commission oppos there along with a host of lesser brotherhoods so each one of those secret societies is controlled by the Jesuits persecution of the Catholic church in Germany has been directed only against those elements which did not entirely submit to the ever increasing\n\n(43:09) centralization of authority in church and state so sometimes it looks as if even the Catholics are suffering but only those Catholic groups that are not totally submissive to this system will be subjugated some Catholic order ERS were actually opposed to the Jesuits they were killed they were wiped out in\n\n(43:32) the French Revolution the Dominicans had taken over the Inquisition from the Jesuits boom they were Zapped and the Jesuits took it back its objective was and E still to destroy the effects of the reformation and to reestablish the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation a greater German in other words must be made again the\n\n(43:59) center of a revived Holy Roman Empire Leo H lemman 1942 an American historian said that isn't it fascinating that the Russian president or a Russian president let me put it that way and many political leaders have given the assurance that Germany will once again play a greater role in the new Europe today isn't it\n\n(44:25) also fascinating that it was a Jesuit priest father Stamper and not Hitler who wrote mine in fact you can read it on Mom itself now the SS used this symbol of the skull and cross bones what was that a symbol of do you remember it was the symbol of Jupiter the god Jupiter the god of death it's also the symbol of Osiris who was the\n\n(44:52) god of death Anubis is just another form of Osiris he is the god of death he's the god of the dead but Jesus says I am the god of the living I am not the god of the Dead I'd rather serve the god of the living the SS was organized by himla according to Jesuit order principles the rules of service spiritual exercises\n\n(45:19) prescribed by ignasius laa constituted a model which himla strove carefully to copy absolute obedience was the Supreme rule every order had to be executed without comment every single statement is being read from a reputable Source again in that wonderful book The Great controversy we get an idea of the\n\n(45:42) Jesuits throughout christiandom protestantism was menaced by formidable foes the first triumphs of the Reformation passed Rome summoned new forces hoping to accomplish its destruction at this time the order of the Jesuits was created notice what this quote says the most cruel unscrupulous and Powerful of all the champions of\n\n(46:06) popery cut off from every Earthly tie and human interest dead to the claims of natural affection reason and conscience holy silenced they knew no rule no tie but that to their order and no duty but to extend its power we don't have to read the whole quote but they made it their business to destroy Protestants\n\n(46:27) ISM the Jesuit order therefore stands before us as the embodiment of a system which aims at temporal political domination and that over the whole world you will say to me surely China will not be subject well we already wrote read a quote by the Jesuit General himself where he says he controls China who\n\n(46:51) controls communism the Jesuits created it and therefore they control it they practiced it in their in their uh South American examples where they practiced it before they instituted it very interesting this is Count V hbro 1911 German Noble and ex Jesuit who says this very thing at what then do the Jesuits aim\n\n(47:20) according to them they seek the greater glory of God but if you examine the facts you will find they aim at Universal Dominion alone it is they who rule the world one quote after the other moreover the pope has thousands of secret agents worldwide they include the Jesuits the Knights of Columbus the Knights of Malta\n\n(47:41) Opus de and others the vatican's intelligence service and its field resources are second to none even Dave Hunt American Baptist historian says that so let's have a look at some of of these institutions let's have a look at Freemasons The Grand Design exposed says the truth is the Jesuits of Rome have\n\n(48:07) perfected Freemasonry to be their most magnificent and effective tool accomplishing their purposes among Protestants now surely the members of Freemasonry themselves must be deceived because if they saw it they wouldn't do it right so actually the order is being used and they themselves are deceived and only\n\n(48:34) within the order higher up are those chosen ones who know and they are controlled by the Jesuits for R very clever very clever to make protestantism do what you cannot do openly because you have been fingered by protestantism as the Antichrist so this is is very interesting this is a Templar Fortress\n\n(49:00) in and and a church on the island mayorca Spain there again you have the double-headed eagle and you can go to virtually any church on that island and you will find the double-headed Eagle over the altars of these churches as I've said Adam viop was the father of jacobinism and he is the one who is also\n\n(49:24) the founder of the Illuminati from the Jesuit college at engelstad it is said to have issued the sect known as the Illuminati of Bavaria founded by Adam visal its nominal founder however seems to have played a subordinate though conspicuous role in the organization of the se you see again they use a front and a front and a\n\n(49:47) front now here are two Jesuit generals this one over here is General Ricky and this is General leov I and very interesting this one over here 1773 to 1840 14 he ruled during the order's suppression now notice this the Vatican itself suppressed the Vatican the the Jesuits between 1773 and 1814 what happened to the Vatican in\n\n(50:17) that time there was a mortal wound and the pope was taken into Exile and he died isn't that correct so who gave the Mortal wound to the papacy the own order in the own church power struggle and he created in his time the Illuminati was created through Vice hopt and of course he's also the father of modern communism who with his\n\n(50:47) jaab beines conducted the French Revolution years later Jesuit General lovsky with his bolik conducted the Russian revolution in 1917 and it's identical to the other Revolution and I will deal with that when I give a lecture on revolutions and wars and dictators later in the series France's greatest Authority on\n\n(51:13) the Jesuits Edmund Paris said the Russian Revolution by eliminating the SAR protector of the Orthodox church had it not decapitated the great rival and helped the penetration of the Roman Church we must strike while the iron is hot the famous ricom Russian College of Rome is created in 1929 and its clandestine\n\n(51:36) missionaries will take the good news to its schismatic country one century after their expulsion by tar Alexander the the Jesuits will again undertake the conquest of the slav world and did the poor Slavic World suffer they were slaughtered by the Millions history will show what happened there when Stalin probably one of the\n\n(52:03) greatest mass murderers of all time did his thing Frederick the great so-called of Prussia caused the high degrees of masonic constitutions of the ancient right to be revived and he himself wrote the Constitutions under the guide of the Jesuit General Encyclopedia of Freemasonry Albert G Mackey says that\n\n(52:25) himself very interesting and now notice this this is a source that's unbelievable this is Isis unveiled by blavatsky herself the author of Secret Doctrine she says that the rights are The Offspring of the sons of Ignatius Lala the Scottish right and all of these worked under the instructions from the\n\n(52:50) general of the Jesuits so who controls Freemasonry the there's no doubt about it here we have confirmed the induction of the Knights Templar Mason into the councils of the said order of Knighthood and hoping in confiding that he will ever be so demean himself as to conduct to the glory of IHS the most holy and\n\n(53:12) almighty God to the honor of the Mark we do recommend there's a ritual in Freemasonry which is totally Jesuit so the Jesuits control Freemasonry here's a Freemason uh Temple if you like it's in uh Oklahoma there is IHS this is a Freemason Temple it's a lodge there is IHS in it there are still old ladies\n\n(53:39) male and female about the country who will tell you with grim gravity that if you trace up masonry through all its orders till you come to the Grand tiptop head Mason of the world you will discover that the dread individual and the chief of the Society of Jesus are one and the same person James Patron\n\n(53:57) American historian there are many that say these things Knights of Malta the Freemasons are in the forground while the Jesuits and the Knights of Malta are in the background the Jesuits control even the Knights of Malta now who are they well they are headquartered in Rome these nights they used to be on an\n\n(54:18) island but besides that they used to be a military order they are still a military order they are Knights they control the banking of the world the industry of military complexes of the world they oversee Chase Manhattan bank with all its branches they rule all the intelligence communities the KGB the CIA and uh all\n\n(54:40) of these things to restore the Dark Ages everything I'm saying is a quote I'm saying nothing don't accuse me of saying anything I'm just reading who are they well here's the head of the Knights of Malta at the moment in America this well he's dead now this is Francis Joseph Cardinal Spelman Cardinals of New York and their\n\n(55:02) headquarters is St Patrick's Cathedral the arch uh the dees of the Archbishop of New York there are the various ones here's um Terren Cardinal cook then was Cardinal okona and uh currently Cardinal Archbishop of New York Edward M Eagan now let's have a look who the members of the Knights of Malta are that should be\n\n(55:26) interesting interesting some past some present General alava George Anderson Angleton Azu berti Bobs Bonaparte does that name ring a bell borgis Bradley Brady Pat Buchanan does that name ring a bell James Buckley Prescott Bush does that ring a bell Frank cpra William Casey does that ring a bell CIA uh says Nero Cooks coflin Lo\n\n(55:59) gistang does that ring a bell president of the of France Bill Donovan Alan dullas Avery dullas Edward Egan that's of course the Cardinal himself France seon John Farrell Flanigan Flynn gy Galan Gorman Grace General Alexander ha does that ring a bell uh Otto F hapsburg wow Conrad Hilton heinley himla he was Knights of Malta\n\n(56:27) Jay Edgar Hoover FBI CIA Fame uh Joseph Kennedy Ted Kennedy locken lemon lorenza loose Henry loose founder of all the great magazines and Time Magazine and all of them great publishing mag magnet uh McDonald Manhattan you named them all of them O'Neal ortis F France Fon paren The liate Who uh worked with Adolf\n\n(56:56) Hitler Peron uh Rocco a the list goes on and on and on Frank Shakespeare Martin sh even Frank Sinatra was a knight of Malta for interest sake so there are prominent men who are Knights of Malta now what about the Knights of Columbus the founder of the Knights of Columbus his father Michael mgne he lived a very short time then he died he\n\n(57:23) was very young he died at the age of 38 there is their emblem and uh this is their official home web page you can just take it straight off and you could see something fascinating what is that hello do you remember what it is a little bundle of rods that you also found in the French Revolution right\n\n(57:43) there in the Manifest of Human Rights what is it fasi and they've got to wreath around them what does that mean all power in one man who will that man be who do the kns Columbus founded by a Roman Catholic priest want to see the power vested in the pope of course the Knights of Columbus founded at New Haven\n\n(58:07) Connecticut 1882 uh it then it was already considered 300,000 strong Roman Catholics are only Roman Catholics are eligible it is initiative to service in 4 degrees it's the heart of soul of politics you cannot get into politics if you don't have the stamp of approval of these guys the fact is well known to\n\n(58:30) political machines and non- Catholic politicians whose candidates must receive the approval of Rome and the Knights before they dare nominate them for either dog pound or presidency the Knights of Columbus principal business is politics a jesuitical politics a men uh men to the Nations Jeremiah Crowley is the quote\n\n(58:54) these are serious accusations there they are with their fasy eye which will become clearer as we go on and we can see where we are heading for today Rome considers the listen to this today Rome considers the fascist regime the nearest to its dogmas and interests we have not merely the Reverend Jesuit father coflin praising\n\n(59:20) melini's Italy as a Christian democracy but their official magazine which is civilta catholica this is the official Jesuit magazine says this is the house organ of the Jesuit says fascism is the regime that corresponds most closely to the concepts of the Church of Rome this is scary have you noticed lately that there\n\n(59:49) is more and more control have you noticed some of these things have you noticed that you are being treated more and more like uh someone who has to Bow 20,000 times before the powers and there is the organization Opus day is a semi secet religious lay order with Paramount objective is total support of the\n\n(1:00:16) papacy and these people walk around with clamps that tear into their flesh so that they have constant pain with every movement to remind them of their obligation and they have high high members like presidents for example of Portugal is Opus day member then we have the Skull and Bones organization who are they well they have\n\n(1:00:40) this interesting Skull and Bones what does it represent you know that by now Jupiter and they have the number 322 if you look up Genesis chapter 3:22 you will find now man has become as one of like one of us knowing good and evil raising man to the level of deity this is Yale University the place where they\n\n(1:01:07) are now let's consult one of the greatest authorities on skull and bones that is Anthony Sutton let's ask him who he is educated at the universities of London gating and California former research fellow at the Hoover Institute Stanford University as well as economics professor of Califor California State\n\n(1:01:24) University he had the guts to speak out and write a book and it cost him dearly but nevertheless let's quote him there is the book Anthony Sutton America's Secret establishment and introduction to the order of Skull and Bones so that I don't say it let's quote it Skull and Bones it's over it's bush bush won the\n\n(1:01:50) election let's watch this video Yale University the science of America's first families confess their sexual exploits from a gruesome coffin in a Smoke Filled Room a handful of power Brokers manipulate the global economy these are the purported activities of some of America's secret societies groups with names like Bilderberg skull\n\n(1:02:13) and bones and the trilateral commission the Skull and Bones society is founded in 1832 by 15 seniors at Yale University in New Haven Connecticut they establish a secret society with rules and rituals that remain unchanged to this day the skull and Bon's initiation ceremony is said to be held in April in\n\n(1:02:37) the tomb's basement one distinguished member serves as Master of Ceremonies once in Rog he is known as Uncle Toby the shortest senior is appointed little devil and Dons a satanic costume a bonesman with a deep voice is dressed as Don kot another is dressed as the college's founder eliu Yale still another is given papal\n\n(1:03:04) vestments it would all be funny if it weren't for the fact that among the former bonesmen are three presidents William Howard Taft George Bush George W bush numerous senators and ambassadors industrialists like William Whitney CIA agents State Department officials and Publishing magnet Henry loose absolute secrecy is also required\n\n(1:03:30) in his 1999 autobiography George W bush devotes just one sentence to his membership in Skull and Bones quote my senior year I joined Skull and Bones a secret society so secret I can't say anything more the secrecy According to some researchers is there to protect the fact that Skull and Bones funnels its\n\n(1:03:54) initiates in into positions of power and influence the best known bonesman is ex-President George Bush who according to tradition is supposed to avoid admitting he's a member Mr President are you a member of Skull and Bones leave the room American Journal got a similar response when we recently asked George Bush Jr the governor of\n\n(1:04:20) Texas about his membership does it still exist the thing is so secret I'm not even sure sure still exists the council okay so you'll see that George W bush is a member they lie in a coffin they bow down before a Papal figure swear Allegiance they do all kinds of weird sexual things in a coffin which I'm not\n\n(1:04:41) going to uh explain what they do here it's pretty vile and uh these are the presidents of the most powerful countries in the world and they belong to secret societies such as this the order what it is and how it began those on the inside know it as the order others have known it for more than 150 years as chapter 322 of a German\n\n(1:05:08) secret society that is very important in fact this was discovered when they broke in and stole some of the papers at that uh institution it uh is officially known as the Russell Trust of 1856 or as the Brotherhood of death because they serve the god of death who happens to be Anubis if you like Osirus\n\n(1:05:35) if you like or Jupiter the American chapter of the German order was founded in 1833 at Yale University by General William hutington Russell and uh toughed the only man to be both president and Chief Justice of the United States interesting now the German order what is this actually mean the Illuminati had its origin at the\n\n(1:05:59) University of englad and Rec recruits were from the student en Corps of course they had to be students with high connections you know sons of of uh very high insiders the order had its origin in Yale in 1833 but skull and bones is a chapter of a German secret society so which organization does it represent\n\n(1:06:23) active members have enough influence to push their sons and relatives into the order and there's significant intermarriage amongst the families and they fall into major categories two major categories we find the old line American families second families who occupy great wealth when he's initiated into the order he says tonight he will\n\n(1:06:44) die to the world and be born again into the order as he will henceforth refer to it the order is a world unto itself in which he will have a new name and 14 New Blood Brothers also with new names now there's also a British chapter which was established at Oxford University and All Souls college and the\n\n(1:07:04) British element is called the group so the Skull and Bones is not the only one you have the group and then you have a European order as well so the group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothchilds the Inner Circle and uh so there is a worldwide uh secret organization which has the highest individual in Industry\n\n(1:07:29) government all facets of life and they actually are the most prominent rulers in the world today and if they are a chapter of a German Society then they are the Illuminati and George W bush said that there are a thousand points of light Illuminating the world at the moment it's interesting that the order uh writes many constitutions the\n\n(1:07:55) members WR Constitution for example archel mlash who is a member of skull and bones or was he wrote the Constitution of UNESCO now we're going to have to deal with UNESCO and find out what it's about churches the union Theological Seminary is under the control of Skull and Bones a very interesting Seminary we'll\n\n(1:08:18) deal with these in more detail in another lecture major establishment of law firms Communications and Industry the Federal Reserve and all of these are controlled by the order this is how chapter 322 operates there's a central inner core notice that this is actually the allseeing eye the wedge of the eye\n\n(1:08:41) but that's something else uh there's a inner core there's an inner circle there's an Outer Circle there's Atlantic Circle the Bohemian Club notice there Bohemian Club part of Skull and Bones Pilgrim Society penumbra order chapter 322 of the order the trilateral commission that's how it's put together\n\n(1:09:01) you could basically put it this way Council of Foreign Relations United Nations bilderberg's Club of Rome Royal Institute of international Affairs and the trilateral commission with the Illuminati controlling everything on the inside forming basically the round table now you saw that the Bohemian Club is\n\n(1:09:20) part and parcel of the issue now what is this Bohemian Club well here's the Bohemian Grove the August 2 1982 edition of Newsweek reported this is just another quote the world's most prestigious summer camp the Bohemian Grobe is now in session 75 miles north of San Francisco it's in a forest it's a fortress but strangely even fortresses\n\n(1:09:47) can be bridged and one enterprising journalist managed to sneak in the fiercely guarded two 7,000 acre Retreat is the country's extension of San Francisco's all male Ultra exclusive Bohemian Club to which every Republican president since Herbert Hoover have belonged this is just a quote this is the Bohemian Grove\n\n(1:10:14) ceremony which was photographed or videotaped very Darkly of course Very secretly by one journalist which caused a major fural now you can see very little in this light so I'll explain to you what's happening there in this Forest the men appear naked naked they have to walk around naked in fact some members have\n\n(1:10:38) left the society because they're tired of walking around naked now imagine every president of the United States has been a member of the Bohemian Grove and you just imagine the priests are dressed Investments papal vestments and they pay homage to an owl because the owl sees in Darkness it has illumination there are other rituals\n\n(1:11:01) which I do not want to talk about that happen between all these naked men and uh if you read your Bibles you will find that those who worshiped in the Groves were called the perverted ones there's the is in his leafy Temple let all within the Grove be reverent before him lift up your heads oh ye trees and be ye lifted up ye Everlasting\n\n(1:11:40) spes for behold here is boheman tride and holy are the pillars of this house is the all for beauty is eternal and we now to Beauty Everlasting for lasting happiness return to one alone and she surrounds you now great nature Refuge of the weary heart we bow to one alone wise great nature he is ever faithful other friends may fail so must\n\n(1:12:19) beomes children little children that believed or ever doubt her and her Fai Bohemians and Priests our funeral fire awaits the corpse of care great of all Mortal wisdom B of bohemia we beseech thee grant us thy counsel ow of bohemia grant us thy [Music] counsel well that's just a part of the ritual which shows that it is nature\n\n(1:12:58) worship it is condemned in the Bible and yet who are the members let's continue this is an article in Mother Jones August 18 1981 volume 6 page 28 and reports Who The prominent members were for example George P Schulz Steven belel uh Gerald Ford Henry Kissinger William Buckley can you imagine them all walking\n\n(1:13:21) around naked worshiping a stupid owl me that's so pathetic Fred Hartley Griffin Haywood C teller Ronald Reagan claen George Bush William French Smith etc etc etc it is pathetic motus uper Randi of the order the activities of the order are directed towards changing our society changing the world to bring about a new world\n\n(1:13:50) order this will be a planned order with heavily restricted individual ual Freedom that's fascism and I will show you the papal encyclicals that will make your hair stand on edge as to what is going to happen all over the world and believe me I live in a country where it's being implemented and you can see it happening\n\n(1:14:19) every single day it is scary but you don't have have to be afraid if you know why it's happening if you do not know why it is happening you will Despair and there are thousands who are putting bullets through their head because they cannot tolerate it 4,000 Farmers driven off the land and murdered in my country\n\n(1:14:44) alone they lose everything they lose hope they put bullets through their heads they wipe out their entire families because it's better for them to die than to live with it and you know what you give a lecture like this and you show what's behind it and why it's behind it and guess what they get hope because they see it's\n\n(1:15:07) not just them and not something they don't understand once they start understanding the bigger picture they gain hope and they say wow so it's not really the end for us because this is simply the sign that Jesus is coming soon and there will be a better Kingdom let us give our lives to Jesus Christ because this world has nothing to offer\n\n(1:15:30) and they get hope no constitutional protection if you go against it they control education I'll show you how in the lectures money law politics economy history psychology philanthropy medicine religion media there is nothing that they do not control and remember they are neither left nor are they right so if they are right rightwing\n\n(1:15:55) parties and left-wing parties they control them what both that's the hegelian principle that's hegelian logic remember that both Marx and Hitler the extremes of left and right presented a textbook enemies evolved out of the same philosophical system hegelianism that brings screams of intellectual anguish\n\n(1:16:18) from Marxist and Nazis remember that the not that the the Jesuits were told that they must serve on this side and the other side remember that and create conflict between the sides this conflict of opposites is essential to bring about the change that they want today this process can be identified in the\n\n(1:16:41) literature of the trilateral commission for example where change is promoted under Conflict Management have you heard that name before right conflict is essential the state is absolute so the state must have total control that means the people must relinquish their rights to the state do you see that happening in the United\n\n(1:17:02) States at the moment absolutely so the state requires complete obedience an individual does not exist for himself in these so-called organic systems but only to perform a role in the operation of the state that's exactly what it was like under nism here's Hegel the two Hegel and are the philosophers behind the system I\n\n(1:17:27) was stunned I was in Europe four weeks ago in Germany and the leaders the presidents of Germany went down and put down wreaths in front of these people's Graves and said their philosophy has made the new Europe possible they honored them what a terrible I would almost say satanic well why not just say\n\n(1:17:57) it philosophy the Illuminati principle that The end justifies the means is also the principle of the group and the order which is Skull and Bones that means you can do anything no matter how dastardly as long as you achieve your aim there's an Outer Circle an inner circle an inner core all of these Council of Foreign Relations is the\n\n(1:18:21) Outer Circle trilateral commission all of those uh trilateral commission was founded by David rockapella comprises 200 members worldwide the Bundy operation uh activism towards a new world Global Order George W bush who was a member of Skull and Bones remember says that he's a big idea a new world order where diverse nations are drawn\n\n(1:18:45) together in a common cause only the United States has both the moral standing and the means to back it up so do you think they're trying to get all the countries of the world to come into this system yes or no do you think it's possible that they are giving their power to a woman who rides them does it\n\n(1:19:06) look like it who controls them the Jesuits and who do the Jesuits say all power must be under the pope isn't that correct all right so who do you think would clamor for a new world order more than anyone else maybe the pope wouldn't that be interesting well here he is new international order urged for the sake\n\n(1:19:35) of Peace when January 3 2004 his whole new year's speech was dedicated to asking for the implementation of the New World Order Vatican City January 1 2004 John Paul 2 started the New Year by insisting that peace is possible and thus a duty and he called for a new international order CNN what did that have to say Pope\n\n(1:20:08) calls for a new world order Thursday January 1 2004 Vatican City Pope John Paul rang in the new year on Thursday with a renewed call for peace in the middle easn Africa and the creation of a new world order based on respect for the Dignity of man and equality amongst Nations what did he say this year Pope\n\n(1:20:32) John Paul directed his thoughts to the continuing conflict around the globe but he stressed that to bring about peace there needs to be a new respect for international law and the creation of a new international order based on the goals of the United Nations he called for an order that is able to give adequate solutions to\n\n(1:20:53) today's problems based on the Dignity of the human being this is human rights on an integral development of society on solidarity amongst Nations rich and poor on the sharing of resources and the extraordinary results of scientific and Technical process you know sharing of resources have you heard of that before\n\n(1:21:10) well there's another term for it it's called redistribution of wealth have you heard of that before right now let me redefine that for you to redistribute wealth means to take the wealth from the one who has it and give it to one who has not got it is that correct now if you do that which nations of the world\n\n(1:21:37) will be hardest hit the Catholic ones are the Protestant ones the Protestant ones are the rich Nations everywhere you can draw a line now I will show you in the lectures that come that there are in cyclicals which Define how the redistribution is to take place and how it is happening and how the encyclical says it should take place\n\n(1:22:05) is what I can see happening in my country without the government lifting a finger against it it is defined by need as we will see now there's another word for taking from one who has and distributing it to someone who does not have it's called theft stealing Thou shalt not steal says the Bible the Pope in Rome says Thou shalt\n\n(1:22:40) steal he does literally I'll show you his encyclical you will be stunned this new world order is going to be an exciting place I don't want much part of it for fortunately my God says my kingdom is not of this world if it were they would fight for me but it is not of this world my kingdom is up there there where your\n\n(1:23:14) treasure is there your heart will be I have managed because I live where I live to loosen myself from that which I own because I know that it means nothing anymore do you know that in my country if you go on a holiday and you stay away for a while and you come back and your house is occupied that you cannot put the new\n\n(1:23:42) tenants out even if the house is yours did you know that because they have need therefore they have the right to take it whether you own it or not and this is not a joke this is a fact scary but who cares I serve a God who has promised the most wonderful things even temporal things to those who serve him wonderful\n\n(1:24:16) promises I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again to take you where I am also in my father's house saw many rooms I go actually doesn't mean rooms it means Mansions God has prepared things for us which make this world sick by comparison so let them have their Kingdom let them have their\n\n(1:24:43) fun because my God says this world will come to an end and the kingdom of God will reign forever and ever and ever don't miss the next lectures we're now on a roller coaster ride that will take you to exciting places thank you for coming [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music]\n\n(1:27:15) [Music] a [Music]",
  "# Title:212_hidden_agendas_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_thegreatcontrovrsy_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nHidden Agendas,Freemasonry,Occult Symbolism,Luciferian Doctrine,New World Order\n\n## Guide:\nThis source delves into the \"hidden agendas\" of Freemasonry and other secret societies, asserting that their public image as philanthropic organizations masks a deeper, more occult purpose. Walter Veith, the speaker, argues that these groups, including Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, and the New Age movement, are interconnected and ultimately controlled by a \"military powerful arm\" (the Jesuits). A central theme is the \"two doctrines\" system: an exoteric, public teaching often aligning with local religions, and an esoteric, secret doctrine reserved for high-ranking initiates. This concealed truth, according to the source, revolves around Luciferianism and a rejection of traditional Christian teachings, with the ultimate goal of uniting the world under a single, Luciferian-inspired system, often achieved through deliberate chaos and manipulation.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 212 - Hidden Agendas / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith www.loudcryministries.org #THEGREATCONTROVRSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTHpqQ6XFKw\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the title of tonight's lecture is hidden agendas because that's exactly what this is about it's about hidden agendas so tonight we're going to have a look at Freemasonry and look behind the scenes as to what it really entails because most Freemasons like in all secret societies are fully unaware of what\n\n(01:28) happens behind the scen sins you will remember that Gary H car in his work on rout to Global occupation gave a very similar uh expose he also takes it through cabalism gnosticism to the Knights Templars then he misses out on the the Jesuit connection which is the military powerful arm controlling all these things and he has Freemasonry\n\n(01:56) control Marxism American European secret political societies International banking Elite and then scarily the World Council of churches now this is not me saying this this is this man and he is uh no small fish and uh theosophical societies together with many Cults then constitute what is known as the New Age movement\n\n(02:26) and the New Age movement is much larger than what we believe just to be uh a few esoterics doing their thing it culminates in an entire system which is to unite the entire world and the world Council of churches will play a very prominent role in this mechanism so it's very important that we know what\n\n(02:51) Freemasonry stands for the outer shell of Freemasonry proposes to sell whatever Rel religion is prominent in that area so for example if you are living in a Muslim country and you belong to Freemasonry then the religion that is propagated at the level of the people and at the level the lower level of\n\n(03:15) freemasonary will be Islam if you are living in a Jewish environment then of course the religion will be judism if you are living in a Christian environment environment then the Bible will be the central book in a lodge and as far as the lower Echelon of the members is concerned Christianity will be the basis for the movement but in\n\n(03:42) actual fact if it is controlled by an another Power inside then the picture can be totally different morals and Dogma the very highest Source in Freemasonry page 870 the Templars like all other secret orders and associations had two doctrines one concealed and reserved for the Masters which was johanism the other public which was the\n\n(04:14) Roman Catholic it's quite straightforward so there is a doctrine that is being taught to the masses and the masses are the uninitiated Marx called them cattle they are also called katans they are called goyam they are called all kinds of derogatory names now if the outer shell the teaching of the Templars to the\n\n(04:43) people was Catholicism they also of course adopted a very Pious Garb and pretended this was the Crux of their religion but on the inside they had another religion and the order that they ascribed to is johanism now we have many orders of St John today many orders well just think about some of the large\n\n(05:14) organizations you have Cathedrals to St John where some very strange things happen as we will see as we go along over time we have St John's ambulance for example you know we could go on and on and on and on but I don't want to go into too much detail here all of these are organizations which are philanthropic seem to be doing a very\n\n(05:38) good thing they run many many hospitals they give huge sums of money to the poor and to the to the uh well whatever to Children's Hospitals to the crippled people in the world and being so philanthropic it is very hard to pin some something negative to organizations that appear to do so so much good and\n\n(06:05) this is actually the best cloak into which to clothe something else that should not be discovered so whenever you see johanism supposedly of course from John the Baptist then IE it with suspicion so two doctrines one to the outside and one to the inside morals and Dogma page 820 the Templars were Gravely accused of\n\n(06:36) spitting upon Christ and denying God at their receptions of gross obscenities conversations with female devils and the worship of monstrous Idol now we discussed that in the previous lecture the end of the drama is well known and how jacqu deal and his fellows perished in the Flames but now this is the\n\n(06:57) highest source of Freemasonry but before his execution the chief of the doomed order organized and instituted what afterwards came to be called The Occult hermetic or Scottish masonry in the Gloom of his prison The Grandmaster created four Metropolitan Lodges at Naples for the east at Edinburg for the West at Stockholm for\n\n(07:20) the North and at Paris for the South the initials of his name jbm found in the same order in the first three degrees are but one of the many internal and cognant proofs that such was the origin of modern Freemasonry that's from the horse's mouth so the Templars aren't really dead but still alive in fact in the York\n\n(07:43) right there is a a level which is the Templar level so everything is there the 32nd degree of masonry Sublime Prince of the royal secret that's the highest level of Scottish Freemasonry there is one higher degree the 333rd degree but that is an honorary degree so the highest level of Freemasonry is the\n\n(08:06) 32nd again morals and Dogma the occult science of the ancient Magi was concealed under the shadows of the ancient Mysteries it was imperfectly revealed or rather disfigured by the gnostics they don't show the whole picture it was guess that under the obscurities that covered the pretended Crimes of the Templars and it\n\n(08:28) is found in enveloped in enigmas that seem impenetrable in the rights of the highest masonry do you have that so out of the horse's mouth The Mystery of the ancient Magi and the uh Shadows of the ancient Mysteries are present and known to the highest levels of Freemasonry none of the lower levels know anything about this they come into\n\n(08:56) the lodge and they think it is uh a Christian Society with well at least with Christian flavor if then a Christian Lodge and that they are a Brotherhood for doing good unto others well this is s Salvador this is in mayorca where the Templars of course found protection under the Spanish Kings and uh if you go into the Templar\n\n(09:22) Enclave you will find on the altars of the churches remember that the Templars were an order of the Roman Catholic Church like the Jes STS are today the most powerful order within the church so they were the most powerful order in the church that controlled not only the military aspects because they were\n\n(09:41) Knights but they also controlled the financial aspects and the double-headed Eagle was part and parcel of their symbolism two heads yanos had two heads he looked forwards and he looked backwards if you go to the other churches you will find them on the altars there it is above the altar of the churches on mayorca now this is\n\n(10:06) rosac crism the Rose is a symbol of their deity well here are some of the occult teachings of Rosicrucianism where you have the ziats the levels that you can attain to and this is pure cabalism now you must understand that in the cabala it is not yve who is the true ruler it is Lucifer who is the true ruler but we\n\n(10:37) will come to that as we come later and the zots are emanations of his uh appearance so let's ask morals and Dogma again what it has to say about the cabala which by the way is called the most holy cabala today the talut is called the holy talut and the Bible is just called the Torah isn't that strange\n\n(11:02) the Bible is called the Torah and then a book of rules that never appear in the Bible is called the holy talmud and an occult book is called the most holy cabala and I would like to venture so far as that there are very very very few rabbis in the world today that are not cabalists which is scary the holy cabala or tradition of\n\n(11:26) the children of set this is of course not true according to this Doctrine then set would have been an apostate already or they turn it round they say not an apostate and initiate so there's an internal Doctrine for the initiate and a public Doctrine for the goyam for the cattle just to keep them occupied tradition of the children of\n\n(11:49) set was carried from Cala by Abraham taught to the Egyptian priesthood by Joseph recovered and purified by Moses concealed Under symbols in the Bible revealed by the Savior to St John there you have it again the Johansen nightes and contained entire under htic figures analogous to those that allity in The\n\n(12:09) Apocalypse of that Apostle okay so now he's turned everything around Abraham Joseph Moses were all initiates and what they taught to the people was Dil let's put it that way to keep them happy and to keep them uninformed but on the inside they had another Doctrine now that's of of course not true because Moses wrote the Torah and\n\n(12:39) everything they believe is the opposite of what the Torah teaches and the cabala that book turns the Torah upside down and makes it occult the three great Lights of the lodge are symbols to us of the power wisdom and beneficience of the deity they are also symbols of the first three cots emanations of this deity according\n\n(13:06) to the cabala so the cabala is very very Central in this uh story we read on every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion although they are told that it is not a temple of religion here morals and Dogma says it is a temple of religion and its teachings are instructions in religion this is true religion revealed to the ancient ient\n\n(13:29) Patriarchs now we've seen that they've turned the ancient Patriarchs upside down into occultists in order to sell this to the people of course which masonry has taught for many centuries and which it will continue to teach as long as time endures okay thank you let's ask some questions and we'll ask masonry to answer it and the sources\n\n(13:56) we will use are only the high highest Masonic writings and the the Freemasons that will be uh asked to give answers will be of only the very highest degree so Albert Macky he wrote the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry you cannot get a better Source than that most of the best lodges the greatest Lodgers have the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry and\n\n(14:22) he was a 33 Dee Freemason which means he was an initiate is Freemasonry a Christian organization if Freemasonry were simply a Christian institution the Jew the Muslim the Brahman the Buddhist could not conscientiously partake of its illumination so it's not a Christian institution so why is the Bible there\n\n(14:41) it's there as a symbol as we saw of the first three cerat is it Christian Freemasonry is not Christian nor substitute for it well what is it then morals and Dogma rejecting all the Wild and use useless speculations of the zena Vesta the cabala the gnostics and the schools are the religion and philosophy of\n\n(15:06) masonry you cannot get it plainer than that masonry is a search of the light the search leads us directly back as you can see to the cabala in that ancient and little understood medley of absurdity and philosophy the initiate will find the source of many doctrines all truly dogmatic religions that includes Islam Buddhism Hinduism\n\n(15:27) all of them have issued from the cabala and returned to it everything scientific and Grand in the religious dreams of all the Illuminati the ones that are illuminated this is luciferian language Jacob Burma swedenborg St Martin and others is borrowed from the cabala all the Masonic associations owe to it their secrets and their symbols\n\n(15:52) straightforward there can be no doubt about these issues the true Mas is therefore not Creed bound cannot say he's a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew he realizes with the Divine illumination of his lodge that as a Mason his religion must be Universal Christ Buddha or Muhammad the name means little for he recognizes only\n\n(16:15) the light and not the bearer he worships at every Shrine bows before every altar whether in the temple mosque or Cathedral realizing with his truer understanding the Oneness of all spiritual truth that's manly pahal the Lost keys of Freemasonry can you see where World Council of churches could come in with\n\n(16:35) something like this joining all the religions together can does it start make the little sound little ring a bell or whatever well let's continue Five Points of Fellowship foot to foot knee to knee breast to breast hand to back mouth to ear these are identical to those used in the drudik right of Witchcraft and very similar\n\n(16:59) to those used in other rights such as the ginian alexandrian rights now Alexandria that's where the occult knowledge was maintained it was maintained in Alexandria and in Rome everything else in between was destroyed we'll come to that a little later there where Christianity flourished it no longer exists Islam exists there and\n\n(17:23) from Alexandria and later from Rome emanated the new religion passing a secret name a chant from mouth to ear is ancient magical practice reflected in the Hebrew word cabala so it's a secret religion now why is the King James Bible on the altar masonry has nothing to do with the Bible it is not founded upon the Bible for if\n\n(17:48) it were it would not be masonry it would be something else the digest of masonic law page 207 to 209 so it's not the Bible the Bible is there as a what as a symbol but what about God and his son Jesus Christ Humanity in total then is the only personal God here again we are talking about high Masons revealing\n\n(18:14) their information Humanity have you heard of the humanist Manifesto and humanism in general right this is a fascinating quote from morals and Dogma I read this entire book it's the most heavy reading I've ever done in my life I wouldn't suggest anybody reads it it's such a pain in the neck but nevertheless the Bible is an\n\n(18:43) indispensable part of the furniture of a Christian Lodge this is in the original discursive only because it is the sacred book of the Christian religion the Hebrew pent tur in a Hebrew Lodge and the Quran in a muhammadan one belong on the Altar and one of these and the square and the compass properly understood are the great Lights\n\n(19:12) by which a Mason must walk and work okay which one which one of the three is the great light well you have three choices it could be the Bible it could be the pentat or it could would be the Quran I won't reveal it to you tonight but it'll get clear which one it is masonry teaches that Redemption and\n\n(19:39) salvation are both the power and the responsibility of the individual Mason saviors like ham they have a ritual where they go through the raising of uh HFF can and do show the way but men must always follow and demonstrate each for himself self his power to save himself to build his own spiritual Fabric in his\n\n(20:03) own time and way every man in essence is his own Savior and Redeemer for he does not save if he does not save himself he will not be saved all right now it's getting a little bit clearer do we need Jesus Christ in all of this not really Masonic author Pearson admits the Masonic Legend stands by itself\n\n(20:23) unsupported by history or other than its own Traditions yet we recog recognize read recognize in h this is the one who is symbolically raised from the dead when a mason in his ritual is called out of the coffin to rise up and uh receive new life we recognize Osiris of the Egyptians the mitras of the Persian the\n\n(20:51) bakus of the Greek dius of the fraternity of the artifas and atis of the frians whose passion death and resur Resurrection were celebrated by these people respectively so in other words the ancient religion which counterfeit the religion of Salvation in Jesus Christ is the religion of masonry so it's the old\n\n(21:13) Pagan religion which has another deity now how do we know if all of these have the exactly the same ritual that Jesus went through how do we know which one is right the answer is the Book of Daniel in chapters 8 and N give the precise time when the Messiah would be born and the circumstances and that is why the Jews\n\n(21:38) have placed a curse on anyone who numbers the 70 weeks because then you would find out who the real Messiah is so none of these could qualify for a messiah because none of them had been predicted to the letter so if we look at their symbolism you will find it there you will find the Obelix which is a symbol\n\n(21:59) of the male organ of Osiris which got lost when he was disseminated and Isis put him together and built the missing piece let's not go into too much detail anyway she did manage to get pregnant by it and give burst to Horus so here we have the Egyptian you will see here the the Torah The Ten Commandments you'll see\n\n(22:22) candlesticks you'll see pyramids you'll see Egyptian worship you will see Sun worship all of it in their symbolism here is a ritual of the raising of hyam here is the book the history of Freemasonry and you'll notice the symbol over there at the top the allseeing eye which is also the symbol of the Jesuits\n\n(22:43) remember in the previous lecture we showed that the Jesuit order created Freemasonry wrote its rituals and we gave all the quotes everything has been done you can look at up in the previous lecture so I'm not going to go into that detail here are some of the symbols that they used and uh we can look at some of them the\n\n(23:01) symbols come to have two meanings remember everything we using here is a bona feeder quote the esoteric and the exoteric the esoteric meaning was the true or original meaning understood only by a few and closely guarded by them the exoteric meaning that's for the goam for the cattle for the stupid ones the\n\n(23:26) uninitiated was the invented or modified explanation intended for the many the sacred M Mysteries which are often mentioned in connection with many ancient religions and which were closely guarded by the initiate concerned esoteric meanings in the religions of previous times these sacred Mysteries were\n\n(23:46) often were merely continuations of the simpler forms of the early sex worship carried on by a select few well in the previous lecture we saw rituals going on where people today gather naked in forests and that includes the presidents of the countries that rule the world today and we saw that in the previous\n\n(24:14) lecture nothing has changed our Masonic Masonic initiates misled what about poor Mason himself let's go to the best source in the world morals and Dogma page 819 the blue degrees that's the first three degrees of Freemasonry are but the outer Court of the pora of the Temple part of the symbols are displayed there to the\n\n(24:40) initiate but he is will you note this intentionally misled by false interpretations it is not intended that he shall understand them but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them now wonder they don't give this book to the lower initiates that would freak them out right their true explication is reserved\n\n(25:06) for the adeps the princes of masonry the whole body of the royal and sacral art was hidden so carefully centuries since in the high degrees there you have it only the high degrees know what is going on this is the horse's mouth nobody can argue with that masonry like all the religions all the Mysteries hermeticism\n\n(25:26) and Alchemy conceals itself secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misrepresentations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it truth is not for those who are unworthy or unable to\n\n(25:50) receive it or would pervert it so masonry jealously conceals its secrets and intentionally leads conceal interpreters astray morals and Dogma page 104 105 there you have it straight from the horses mouth here's a high Mason book in Germany and uh it tells us there exactly what they do a Freemason that's what\n\n(26:16) stands there formed out of the materials of his lodge Behold The Master Mason rare whose Mystic portrait does declare the secrets of Freemasonry fair for all to read and see but but few there are to whom they're known though they so plainly here are shown so this is a language that you have to learn they created this language\n\n(26:39) because God confused the languages so they created a language in symbolism that God would not be able to confuse in future that's their logic now let's have a look at some of the symbols and see where we get Crossed Swords are part of the symbols Cornucopia the Horn of Plenty we have pentagrams and and uh compasses and set\n\n(27:00) squares and G's which they say stand for God but actually stands for generative principle it's the male organ sorry and the female one because that's the only way you're going to generate this stands for the masculine this stands for the feminine now if you go back into the other religions if you go to e to China\n\n(27:23) for example and you look at the the sun god so so the equivalent in other words of Isis and Osiris you will find that they are here they are FY and NOA there they are on their cave drawings here they are and you will note that fxy and Noir carry the compass over there and the set Square they are symbols of the\n\n(27:45) male and female deities that's what it stands for so the cathedrals of the world it was just interesting this one was being repaired and of course who would repair it the company's a but what does that tell us what kind of company would it be it's a masonic company right here you have the apron and the apron has various symbols\n\n(28:09) on it you will see there the Sun and the Moon with the Stars around it and the compass and the set square and of course hidden in here there is the Mystic letter M and uh that is the sigma on its side but uh Masonry of course starts in every single language in the world masonry starts with an M well we don't go or through all the\n\n(28:36) details I just want you to recognize some of them the keys are very prominent you'll find them in the religious systems Mystic towels are very prominent um pigeons with olive leaves in their in their mouths the pee symbol all of the symbolism comes from masonry and uh Hammers and sickles are part of the symbolism of Freemasonry you\n\n(29:00) know where that occurred don't you and uh here you can set this uh set Square either in the sickle form or in the other form the allseeing eye of course the pentagram and the Pentagon very prominent these are occult symbols today we have whole buildings that are built like pentagons you know that and then you have of course the\n\n(29:26) figure of the johans sonite the St John the so-called one who's really a symbol of something else and it has the X and then it has the cross what do you notice about that cross it's an upside down cross symbol of victory over Jesus Christ now we'll come to some other details about that in a moment so\n\n(29:46) Hammers and sickles and upside down crosses and G's and all kinds of interesting things sun moon stars all this symbolism if you go to the tracing board s first degree second degree and so forth there's a vast amount of symbolism here sun moon and stars if you inculate those then you get hexagrams pentagrams\n\n(30:10) uh the star is in the East to the UN initiate it is in he's informed that it is the Star of Bethlehem but there's of course a problem if you just think logically the Magi came from the East and they walked towards the star so where was The Star of Bethlehem it was in the West W so this is another one\n\n(30:29) that was in the East and the Bible condemns the praying towards the east right because that represented the Sun God and this star in the east is none other star than Sirius the brightest star in the heaven the luminary the illuminated one is the symbol of Lucifer the brightest planet in the in the heavens is which one is Venus Venus it's\n\n(30:55) called The Morning Star in the morning star name it is masculine as Venus it has a female deity name it's female so you have the male and the female connotation right there the black and white squares represent knowledge of Good and Evil now man has become as one of us knowing good and evil and so we\n\n(31:16) can continue right through all the symbolism we don't have time to go into it all the two pillars yakim and Boaz supposedly the temples of Solomon's temples pillars but these are representations of the zigar of Babylon serpents encircling rings and globes and issuing from Globes are common in the Persian Egyptian Chinese\n\n(31:39) and Indian monuments Vishnu is represented suppos reposing on a coiled serpent so many of their symbolism refers to the ancient deities the serpent with the tail in the mouth is the universal serpent the lifegiver the serpent is the symbol and prototype of the Universal savior who redeems the World by giving creation the knowledge\n\n(32:02) of itself and the realization of Good and Evil manly pahle 33Â° Freemason so it is the serpent that gives you a knowledge of Good and Evil and he is the one who is deified you'll see skulls and babies representing life and death cycles of life and death reincarnation it sees forwards and backwards often these are\n\n(32:26) half white half black representing the knowledge of light and the knowledge of darkness and whether you worship the dark side or whether you worship the light side doesn't really make any difference that is why it is interesting that the Light Side worshippers are known as luciferians and the dark side are known\n\n(32:48) as witches Wizards and satanists and they are the best of friends because the deity is the same it doesn't matter which vehicle you use to get to know him it is the same deity Cosmic Keys the answer to heaven and uh Hades Pagan religious symbols are also very common in Freemasons aen Earth Cirrus Hermes very common one that they\n\n(33:14) use all Jesuit Cathedrals will have the symbol of Hermes and of course masonry claims that it uses hermetic rights heres son of Maz son of ham if you like from the very beginning we haven't got time to go into all the uh details so Jupiter Mars Mercury all these symbols represent deities morals and Dogma page 851 the 32\n\n(33:44) Degree this is the highest degree the hamitic figure there you have him male female is the symbol of the double nature anciently assigned to the deity now remember that the Knights Templars also worship baffet who was a afrodite male female as generator and producer of brah and Maya and Osirus whatever we don't\n\n(34:06) have to go into all the details so if we go through Scottish right masonry the 33rd degree is known as Sovereign Grand Inspector General it's an honorary degree for the highest Masons and uh you have to be a high initiate to get into that and then you get down Sublime Sublime Prince of the royal secret is\n\n(34:26) the 32nd and you go all the way down down down down down until you get down here to the blue degrees which are Entered appren Apprentice fellowcraft and Master Mason and you can go up all the way almost to the top and never know what you're doing never know what you're actually involved in there's a youth\n\n(34:45) group in Freemasonry which is called demole isn't that fascinating that is the man who was sentenced to death for spitting on the cross and for committing sodomy and the most profane things under the Sun but that's the youth group isn't that interesting that Billy Graham said that the demolay are the\n\n(35:05) Elite of the youth in the world fascinating statement Knights Columbus we've seen them with their fashy ey we'll come to that in a later lecture again which control the the world political system at least in the United States and uh the the head of a lodge gets to the position of worshipful master the Bible says You\n\n(35:33) must call nobody Master let alone worshipful master this violates the first commandment the headquarters of the Supreme Council of Scottish right Freemasonry Southern jurisdiction USA this is what you have on the front you have the sxes with the serpents on the sides and this is known as The House of\n\n(35:52) the temple on the east side of Northwest 16 Street between RNs Street in in Washington DC this is where the high Masons meet the entire cabinet of the USA will meet there whether they are democrat or republican makes no difference that is where the decisions are made this is a book no called The Deadly\n\n(36:15) deception written by a man James D Shaw who was initiated into the highest degree the 33rd degree and later uh resend it and left it 33rd degree initiation cere the oath is sealed by drinking wine out of a human skull may this wine I now drink become a deadly poison to me as the hemlock juice drunk by Socrates should I ever\n\n(36:38) knowingly or willfully violate the same a member dressed as a skeleton places his arms around the candidate who then States and may these cold arms forever encircle me should I ever knowingly or willfully violate the same here are some of the symbols of Freemasonry these are the so-called secret symbols\n\n(36:58) if you look at them you'll find some of them are very interesting we're not going to go into all of them let's enlarge some of them if you thought that had something to do with folk swagen I suggest you think again those are the two v's one inside the other representing the union of the two deities and if you thought that was the\n\n(37:15) heart of the Union Jack then you will know now that the Union Jack means that Great Britain is a masonically controlled country so is its religion as we will see these are all symbols of this is Aquarius for example if you thought that was the star of David then ask yourself why before masonry was around there was no Star of\n\n(37:37) David and these symbols over here of course very very prominent we haven't got time to go into all of these we're just opening it up so if you find ecstasy and mandrax tablets being distributed amongst the youth they will have all these symbols on them you thought that was Mitsubishi symbol well they would be\n\n(37:56) very upset of you thought that they uh helped to propagate mandrax and ecstasy and the like and there you have this symbol this v w symbol this W that is uh two v's locked inside each other now these are occult symbols in other words these drugs are being dispensed by an organization that uses the symbols of\n\n(38:21) its religion and if you thought that this papal Cho choir was sponsored by fwen you better think again that symbol means something else on these innocent little children that are bearing luciferian symbols here is aliser Crowley's symbolism you'll see it's very similar we'll have the pentagram and all the\n\n(38:44) other symbols over there the G uh you will notice that that is basically the basic structure and you can fill it in and then you can have a pentagram you can have it the that way around or you could have it the other way around depending on which you want it that would be the goat of Mendes that would be the dark side also\n\n(39:04) unfortunately sorry ladies the female side and that would be the male representation let's ask the dictionary of mysticism to tell us what this means the pentagrams considered by occultists to be the most potent means of conjuring Spirits when a single point of the star points upward it is regarded as the sign\n\n(39:24) of the good and it means to conure benevolent Spirits when the single point points down and a pair of points on the top it is the sign of the evil Satan and is used to conure up powers of evil that's what it says it's interesting that this symbol is of course used everywhere in the world including most\n\n(39:39) of the flags let's ask another source enyclopedia of Freemasonry you won't get a better Source than that Freemasons of the United States have by tcid consent referred to it the pentagram as a symbol of the Five Points of Fellowship so it's the penta of Pythagoras the science of the Magi the pent is called the holy and\n\n(39:59) mysterious pentagram is the star of The Magicians so this is occultism got it all over your flags very interesting double triangles and so forth you have male female good evil Adam kadmon all these symbols a Divine man and now we get to the point where we start revealing what they actually mean and may God help us as we continue along\n\n(40:28) this road and find out what the hidden agenda of this Freemasonry actually is we are now going into the actual teaching of cre Freemasonry we've just looked at the basic framework notice this statement it is far more important that men should strive to become christs than that they should believe that Jesus\n\n(40:55) was Christ that's pretty straightforward the catechism of the Catholic church this particular one this is the catechism of the Catholic Church New York image books 1995 page 129 says the following for the Son of God became man so that we might become Gods the only begotten Son of God wanting to make us sharers in his\n\n(41:22) divinity assume out assumed our nature so that he may made man might make men Gods Marvel and rejoice we have become Christ now not all public catechisms will have this so don't look for it in your general catechism it's that Edition which says it because there's an inner teaching and an outer teaching don't\n\n(41:46) forget that manly palah Hall 33 degree Freemason says man is God in the making Hinduism teaches the this that through your various incarnations and Buddhism teaches it that eventually through narvana you become one with the Divine you are Divine uh another Masonic writer writes be still and know that I am God that I\n\n(42:10) am God the final recognition of the all in all the unity of the self with the cosmos the cognition of the Divinity of the self so this is the opposite of what the Bible teaches in the beginning sin would lead to death but the serpent said you will surely not die you shall be like God so this is serpent language this is\n\n(42:35) not God language this is Lucifer's teaching this is not God's teaching the perfect man is Christ and Christ is God this is the birthright and Destiny of every human soul JD Buck Mystic masonry notice this symbolism again you could get the hexagram out of it and you could get that sign out of it you can turn it\n\n(43:00) around and put it in front of a car as well if you like a triangle with a point down represents the deity and is called the dei's triangle or the master triangle with a point up it is called the Earthly triangle pyramid triangle or the fire triangle and this emblem symbolizes the perfect or Divine man so when a religion\n\n(43:23) uses these triangles in cabalism they are saying we are Divine so the Star of David is a in your face God we are Divine that's terrible statement I'm making here tonight that's a terrible statement with a point upwards the equatorial triangle stands for Shiva the destroyer and signifies the flame which\n\n(43:50) Rises upward from the funeral P towards heaven the symbol is familiar to us the Masons in several degrees notably the 30th degree notice the higher degrees be get initiated into what is going on this is Ward Freemasonry in the ancient gods so Shiva is the god who is there represented we'll come to that in a\n\n(44:09) moment so when you see a symbol like this it's not as simple as it sounds as is kbor plat showing that Ohio historical markers these states are all dedicated masonically the double-headed Eagle we've dealt with already the 32nd degree makes the double-headed eagle its particular emblem and of course also\n\n(44:30) of the 33rd degree in this sign we conquer is what it says over here the males cross also the crown with the cross in it are Masonic symbols and you will find it is the symbol of many churches particularly Pentecostal churches then you have various co-masonry degrees for example this is the symbol used by the\n\n(44:57) Order of the Eastern Star which is female Freemasonry which is of course run by male Freemasonry Freemasonry generally is a white Brotherhood but co-masonry accommodates females and black people so to the uninitiated it seems as if the white race is supreme once you get to the higher initiates there is a different story and Nimrod\n\n(45:23) was worshiped as black or white there is chaos created between the races so you have the klooks clan which is anti- uh black and you have organizations which are equally anti-white this is called dlec thinking remember the hegelian principle you create friction between the races so that you can have synthesis\n\n(45:48) in the end and bring about a new world order so in order to unite the races the best thing to do is to create chaos amongst the races until the pain of Separation exceeds the pain of unity you understand the hegelian dlec thinking it's brilliant it's sick but it's brilliant and it doesn't matter if you\n\n(46:12) sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives to achieve your objective because the end justifies the means it really is a terrible Doctrine so if we go to co-masonry the this is the symbol of uh co-masonry are the symbols words and other Masonic Expressions also found within the occult yes they are they are also used in the\n\n(46:36) Golden Dawn and other societies as we say here is the Order of the Eastern Star here is their main Center the international headquarters also known as the international Temple that is where it is in Washington DC this is Prince Hall Freemasonry this is black Freemasonry and very often the Masons themselves do not know about all these\n\n(47:03) suborganizations so if you go up the ranks of um Prince Hall Freemasonry then you will find Knights Templars up there for example Knight Templar well that tells you something right so they really use these names these are their this is their own uh page so this is not something that has been thought up and\n\n(47:24) the very very highest individuals in the black world for example are Prince Hall Freemasons might I mention the name Nelson Mandela if you're interested this is what they look like so there's no such thing as it just being a white Brotherhood although each one of the groups is individually uh often non-informed this is the the levels\n\n(47:53) these are the levels in Freemasonry and we can fill them in the the actual levels vary according to the source this one here is as it was revealed by a Rand who was the girlfriend of uh Philip Rothchild uh she committed suicide humanism is the lowest level Masons no aprons the YMCA the whole Scout movement\n\n(48:23) out there Etc forms part of Masonic organizations rotary the Lions the Oddfellows well you have them right next door the Lions the Lions of course use the two-headed lion theis the two-headed one all those symbols and these are all good organizations that appear to do very good things blue Masons that's\n\n(48:43) John's Masons there you have the name John again get very nervous when you hear it York right Scottish right communism benit Jewish masonry Council of 500 Council of 33 Council of 500 also known as the bilder burger if you like the Council of 13 and at the highest level we saw that the papacy is involved\n\n(49:03) because the Jesuits control all of them every single level here is the Pope in front of the Boy Scout movement and this is the feeder organization into other organizations and none of them know anything about it so don't accuse them but have a look at some of their symbolism and see if you find the Masonic symbolism there you'll find it\n\n(49:29) female Masons that were very prominent of course Helena Peta blavatsky founder of the theosophical society and he bant Alice a Bailey and Alice a Bailey her husband was Foster he was a 32 Degree Freemason and uh part of co-masonry they started a publishing company known as Lucifer trust which they later changed\n\n(49:53) to luc's trust this is Helena petrona blavatsky this one over here is Annie Alice a Bailey and these are the ones who wrote down the secret of the secret doctrines of course once they achieved the highest degrees then they would have to be male so anib basant is known as brother anib basant 33Â° Freemason the same in the\n\n(50:20) Egyptians if a if a female pharaoh became Pharaoh then she was male so hatot chep suit for for example is figured with a beard because you had to be an honorary male you can't be The Reincarnation of the Sun God if you're a female so co-masonry Annie bassant and all these high Masons Alice a Bailey High Priestess of the New Age movement\n\n(50:45) received messages from a Tibetan known as dwall K on her writings you will find of course the Masonic symbols and these are her writings and of course blavatsky is the one who wrote Isis unveiled uh secret Doctrine and all of these Mystic Masonic books which are virtually impossible to get hold of although these days you can if you\n\n(51:11) search find them let me take you to one of the largest lodges in the world which has become a museum this one is in gatri in Oklahoma we'll go inside you will see swastikas they will say they the other way around yes that might be so but that doesn't mean anything because the one way around it represents the female\n\n(51:33) aspect and the other way around it represents the male aspect so it doesn't make any difference uh you will find the symbol of the sun god raw you'll find the allseeing eyes and then you'll see this statue it can be male it can be female it makes no difference you should figure that out by now with the finger\n\n(51:50) on the mouth and they will tell you that means secrecy don't reveal the secreet or quiet in the lodge all kinds of nonsense they will tell you it's got nothing to do with it this is only for the initiate to know what this is with this SE this is the symbol of Horus and I'll show it to you in a moment on the\n\n(52:09) floor you have uh the various pentagrams in this uh form over here in the pentagons and in front of the statue it says all who stand here stand facing the East Let each review his obligation and renew them in his heart so this worship is towards the East which the Bible forbade now there's the god Horus you\n\n(52:30) will notice that he's always depicted with his finger on his mouth his religion is for the initiate these are the uh the dress of the various Masonic levels The Sovereign Grand Commander has this symbol on the front and there you have it on Sovereign Grand Commander Henry Clawson that it is that's the\n\n(52:53) symbol of baffet that's Buffet the androgenic God and you will be surprised where buffo met features these days I will be showing it to you in future lectures and of course it's also on the building over here which is the headquarters of the mother Supreme Council of the world Washington DC where the constitution for the New World Order\n\n(53:16) has already been written right there that's buffet and this is how the symbolism was also used by Alis a Crowley in the lodge you will find IHS I showed you that was the symbolism for the Jesuit order Isis horor Set uh this stain glass window in the in the light it is uh in the day it is white in the\n\n(53:41) night it becomes black a very special technique and if you know that Osiris was worshiped as black or white then that explains the story they have an Egyptian Room uh with all the symbolism that goes along with it they have an Assyrian room because they represent all the ancient religions here is a statue of Albert Pike it's called\n\n(54:03) the Albert Pike lodge number 162 to study and seek to interpret correctly the symbols of the universe is the work of the sage and the philosopher it is to decipher the writing of God Albert Pike now here is his book morals and Dogma I've scanned this in so that people don't say I'm talking here say they must\n\n(54:23) know I have the book and uh whatever is quoted over here comes directly from him in the Scottish right the crown and scepter symbolize a man's dominion over himself we are God we don't need anyone else to tell us what to do the history of man's thought is the only history worth much study don't worry about the other one there's\n\n(54:47) the library I just photographed it to show you that the history of Freemasonry and the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry are genuine uh books the new age has magazine has been replaced by Scottish right magazine there's also the symbol over there that we spoke about earlier and it is to himself alone that man can\n\n(55:10) find enduring happiness we are our own savior again in this Lodge you will have jacqu deole um honored Rosicrucianism the cross on the Rose the one who really suffered was Osiris not Jesus Jesus Christ and uh there you have the Mystic towel and other symbolism like the lion with Eagle wings symbol of Babylon and\n\n(55:38) here you have the double-headed eagle in its original black white form representing the two deities this is the Cornucopia what does it stand for it is the symbol of many political organizations it was the symbol of the organization that expanded and used aparte it was the symbol of the National Party in southern\n\n(56:00) Africa it's interesting so what were they let's ask what the Cornucopia means the Cornucopia or Horn of Plenty was double sexed in symbolism the horn was masculine and the inside was feminine the fruit inside symbolized productiveness of the female it's a sex symbol again the union of Isis and Osiris so when we look at these\n\n(56:24) deities remember that's Horus Isis she is the one who stands on the serpent Mary is the one who stands in Catholicism on the serpent dianus as child is just the same thing these Gods came in the hexagram in the hexagon uh Etc they came in the Square this is the god harpocrates or if you like uh Horus there he has the\n\n(56:49) Cornucopia in his hand and the finger is broken off that points to the mouth as per usual here's another Masonic Lodge inside you'll have the same symbolism you'll have ying-yang signs up against the ceilings this is the blue room and uh there are only three lights in a lodge because the north is the place of\n\n(57:12) Darkness now if you know your Bibles you will know that the north is where the Throne of God is that's the source of Darkness something's upside down and the various rooms used by the Scottish right and the yor right Etc two pillars always representing yahim and Boaz on top of it you'll see the signs of the zodiac there\n\n(57:37) they are this uh shows you what this is astrology is a science demanding respect of the scholar not withstanding its designation as a black art and in a reflective sense and an occult science this science was known to the Ancients as the Divine o Encyclopedia of Freemasonry so astrology is uplifted by\n\n(57:56) Freemasonry although the Bible condemns it right from that science many of the most significant emblems are borrowed the lodge itself is a representation of the world it is adorned with the images of sun moon and stars and we can go through the astrological symbols and see that they represent phallic worship as well\n\n(58:18) made prominent part of the Mysteries these are all Masonic sources here is another the the Red Room free initiation ceremonies we saw are identical to how Lola presented himself to the pope so they come directly from the Jesuit rituals some of the uh pump and Grandeur of the lodge you will find represented\n\n(58:42) in the parliaments of the world uh the symbolisms this one is very prominent and uh you will see many organizations use it Sports people use it why because the Sports companies and the Sports super structures are all masonically controlled and uh some of the hand signals we're not going to go into that\n\n(59:06) we're going to stick to quotes who is the god of masonry elas Levi mystery of magic what is more absurd and more impious than to attribute the name Lucifer to the devil that is to personify it evil the intellectual Lucifer is the spirit of intelligence and love it is the parac The Advocate isn't that interesting it is the holy\n\n(59:28) spirit where the physical Lucifer is the great angel of universal magnetism so Lucifer is the holy spirit Lucifer is the paracletos he is the advocate the Bible says we have one Advocate and that is Christ Jesus Lucifer represents life thought progress civilization Liberty Independence Lucifer is the\n\n(59:51) logos the word the serpent the Savior there is a secret SEC Doctrine by Elena Peta blavatsky Pages 171225 255 Volume 2 I have them at home if you don't want to believe me I send you a photocopy it is Satan who is the god of our planet and the only God these are pretty direct quotes you won't get round them let's go to Albert Pike\n\n(1:00:15) directly Lucifer is the lightbearer strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of Darkness Lucifer the son of the morning is it he who Bears the light and with its splendor intolerable blinds feeble sensual or selfish Souls doubt it not so who's the god of Freemasonry Lucifer Albert Pike morals and Dogma the\n\n(1:00:37) devil is the personification of atheism or idolatry for the initiate it's not a person but a fce do you know a movie where they say the fce be with you I know a movie like that the Bible says and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light two Corinthians now let's get into the\n\n(1:00:56) gritt this is the instruction to the 23 Supreme councils of the world given in 1889 and it reads as follows Albert Pike the head of Scottish Freemasonry and the founder of their of of of that Bible of free masonry that which we must say to a crowd is we worship a God but it is the god one adors without Superstition to\n\n(1:01:21) you Sovereign Grand inspector's General take not not of this quote I'm going to go a bit slower here to you Sovereign Grand Inspector General we say this that you may repeat it to the Brethren of the 32nd 31st and 30th degree notice it says may it doesn't mean that they do it means you may 32nd 31st and 30th degree the\n\n(1:01:50) Masonic religion should be by all of us initiates of the high degrees be maintained in the purity of the luciferian doctrine if Lucifer were not God would Adonai that's the other one that's Jesus if you like whose Deeds prove his cruelty piy and hatred of man he brought the flood he destroyed Sodom and\n\n(1:02:10) Gomorrah that lovely peace loving oldtime San Francisco he just destroyed it can you believe that and his priests culminate him yes Lucifer is God and unfortunately Adonai is also God because light cannot exist without Darkness blah blah blah blah so question at which level should a Mason know who he's\n\n(1:02:36) worshiping the 30th the 31st the 32nd and the 33rd degree a 33 degree Freemason will know who he worships yes or no is that clear the true name of Satan the cabalists say is yve reversed for Satan is not a black God but but the negation of God for the initiates is not a person but a force Albert pite morals and Dogma page\n\n(1:03:02) 102 to conceive of God the cabala imagined him to be the most occult light Albert Pike morals and Dogma page 740 here is a conjugation addressed to Emperor Luca Emperor Lucifer master and Prince of the rebellious Spirits I adure Thee to leave thine Abode and whatever quarter of the world it may be situated\n\n(1:03:23) and come hither to communicate with me when the M when the Mason learns that the key to the Warrior on the Block is the proper application of the Dynamo of living power he has learned the Mastery of his craft the seething energy of Lucifer in his hands and before he may step onward and upward he must prove his\n\n(1:03:41) ability to proberbly apply energy he must follow in the footsteps of his forefathers tubalcain it's an interesting name we haven't got time to go into all those details who with the mighty strength of the war god hammered his sword into a plow share so you first create war and Chaos so that people will be willing to\n\n(1:04:01) give it up and join into one giant luciferian Empire do you know what irritated the devil most when God separated the Nations that was a headache to him the devil is now called darkness by the church notice to this is a quote from blavatsky this is you cannot get better sources than the this this is secret\n\n(1:04:26) Doctrine page 71 the devil is now called darkness by the church whereas the in the Bible he is called the Son of God the bright star of the early morning Lucifer see Isaiah they turn everything upside down I'll show you why in a moment there's a whole philosophy of dogmatic craft in the reason why the\n\n(1:04:44) first Archangel who sprang from the depths of chaos was called looks Lucifer the Luminous son of the morning or man vanrick Dawn he was transformed by the church into Lucifer or Satan because he is higher and older than Jehovah and had to be sacrificed to the new Dogma so what the UN initiate gets is the doctrine of the Bible washed\n\n(1:05:11) down and the initiate turns it upside down the devil is the true God and Jehovah yve is the bad guy well let's see if we can back it up lat's secret Doctrine page 73 Jehovah esoteric as Elohim is also the serpent or dragon that tempted Eve and the dragon is an old glyph or asly prial principle which is the wisdom of\n\n(1:05:37) chaos okay so the devil is the wisdom of chaos but the real bad guy was who Jehovah so the Bible is turned upside down now Jehovah tempted Eve and not the serpent blavat secret Doctrine volume two the philosophical system of the gnostics and the Primitive Jewish Christians the nazarin and the ebionites\n\n(1:06:02) are fully considered they show the view held in these days outside the circle of Mosaic Jews about Jehovah he was identified by all the nostics with evil so the gnostics believe that Jehovah is the bad one Lucifer is the good one they are luciferians secret Doctrine volume one the Great Serpent of the Garden of Eden\n\n(1:06:24) and the Lord God are ident identical so God is the serpent He's the bad guy turn it around and so are Jehovah and Cain one the Cain who is referred to in theology as the murderer and the liar to God so who's the murderer and the liar now Jesus is the murderer and the liar and the serpent is the good\n\n(1:06:46) guy well secret Doctrine Volume 2 page 388 the appalation Satan Hebrew Satan an adversary from the word shatana to be adverse belongs by right to the first and Crest adversary of all the other gods Jehovah not to the serpent which spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom and ease at the worst even in the Dogma the\n\n(1:07:08) adversary of men this is serious stuff therefore Jehovah was called by the gnostics the creator of and one of the ofin morphs the serpent Satan or evil the cabalists say that the true name of Satan is Jehovah placed upside down I'll tell you something in the Islamic lecture which will really excite you Satan is not a black God but the\n\n(1:07:36) negation of the white deity now black and white has got nothing to do with skin color here it has to do with illumination and so we could go on I'm going to show you something else that's interesting here Jehovah even The Insider knows this Jehovah becomes sat and Michael and his army Satan and the rebellious Angels so Mikel which means\n\n(1:08:06) the one who is what God is is Satan and his angels H and Lucifer and his angels he's setting up his kingdom down here my Bible says Michael is the prince that stands for your people and He will stand up and come and sort the evil one out right or wrong so we've turned the doctrine upside down Michael being simply Jehovah himself one\n\n(1:08:31) of the subordinate Spirits at best they hate Jesus Christ just like the Templars they spit on the cross now if you do not believe the blavatsky source let's go to morals and Dogma the Masonic Source the deity of the Old Testament is everywhere represented as the direct author of evil there he says exactly the same thing I don't have to\n\n(1:08:58) repeat it let's carry on so little have the first Christians who despoiled the Jews of the Bible understood the first four chapters of Genesis in their esoteric meaning now let's go into this that they never perceived that Not only was no sin intended in the Disobedience but actually the serpent was the Lord\n\n(1:09:21) God himself who was as the ofos the logos the be of divine creative wisdom taught mankind to become creators in their turn the serpent was so good to you you would be still stupid if it wasn't for the serpent the devil is now called darkness by the church but the Bible calls him the Son of God remember that one so no\n\n(1:09:45) wonder manly palal 33Â° Freemason says I hereby promise the great spirit lucifuge Prince of the demons that each year I will bring unto him a human soul to do with as it may please him you think they might still have human sacrifices and in return lucifuge promises to bestow upon me the Treasures of the earth and to fulfill my every\n\n(1:10:09) desire for the length of my natural life Manny pahal you can have it I prefer Jesus Christ and eternal life official logo of Ordo Templar Oriental we don't know have to go into all these details who then is allowed to know the truth about masonry we must create a super right now notice carefully which will remain unknown to\n\n(1:10:37) which we will call those Masons of high degrees 30 and above whom we shall select with regards to our brothers in masonry these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy through this supreme right we will govern all Freemasonry which will become the One International Center the more powerful because its direction will\n\n(1:10:59) be unknown this was a letter from Pike to the head of the order of the Illuminati jeppo manini so who governs the world a super right George Bush calls them a thousand points of Lights illuminated ones they don't use this terminology for nothing they were going to create three world Wars there's the quote I'm not going to\n\n(1:11:28) go into details on this quote right now there's a lecture Coming Up Revolutions dictators and Wars we'll look at it then scary stuff oroa is their statement that means order out of chaos the symbol they use for that is the phix rising from the ashes out of the destruction of what God has put onto this planet Satan will create his\n\n(1:11:59) diabolical Kingdom where all nations all religions will become one because that's the only way you can have Universal rulership Jesus says my kingdom is not of this world Jesus says come out and be separat they say come in and be inclusive or else wow it's getting interesting there's another lecture coming up don't miss any\n\n(1:12:29) of these this is amazing stuff if you think that some have said to me Ordu upos is not a masonic statement I said excuse me I've been in the lodge and photographed their documents there it is Oro ab and if you want to know how it got in there just walked in there Witnesses at the back that we didn't do this clandestinely I just went\n\n(1:13:02) in and I photographed it while my wife was talking to someone and keeping them busy there it is Oro up cow this is the main Lodge in England that's the main building now you weren't I wasn't allowed to take any photographs inside you can go into the first portions you couldn't go into the others but I showed you what it looks\n\n(1:13:23) like in one of the other lodges anyway so it doesn't make any difference notice that the north is the place of masonic Darkness the East is where the worshipful master sits representing this androgenic principle the south is where the junior Warden sits the West is where the senior Warden sits then there is an altar and\n\n(1:13:44) there are three Masonic lights these are the symbols that you will find on the Masonic Lodge the compass the set Square the triangles the allseeing eye all of these and uh the allseeing eye let's ask the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry what it stands for so when you see it on the dollar ask the horse's mouth who they\n\n(1:14:08) put it there the allseeing eye is an unimportant symbol of the Supreme Being borrowed from by the Freemasons from the nations of antiquity on the same principle the Egyptians represented Osiris their Chief deity by the symbol of an open eye and placed the hieroglyphic of him in all their temples if it's the right eye it's masculine if\n\n(1:14:29) it's the left eye it's female doesn't really matter which one it is you have Isis and Osiris that's their own source so that's what it means on the dollan it means nothing else it's the symbol that the Jesuits claim as their main symbol so all of these symbols have an esoteric and an exoteric meaning now what does that\n\n(1:14:53) represent that's the the Tower of Babel correct now as we said Babel was an attempt to unite all people in apostasy to God and what did God do he confounded the languages and gave us another 4 and a half thousand years for souls to accept him and be saved what a generous kind God we have so here is the Tower of Babel this comes from a\n\n(1:15:25) masonic Source above there is the allseeing eye and here they are measuring and building it's interesting that uh one of the highest politicians in France said just recently when they put a poster across the whole of Europe of the Temple of the Tower of Babel with a crane on it under construction he\n\n(1:15:49) said we are building a new bab and this time we will succeed well we'll see well let's ask the high Freemasons Arthur Edward we who wrote the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry by the way he should know what it means Arthur Edward W as regards masonry Babel of course represented a masonic Enterprise it is well known that the\n\n(1:16:14) Tower of Babel was one of the most ancient traditions of masonry there you have it I have said nothing tonight please note every single statement I have made has been substantiated from their own highest sources so please don't say that I am presenting things here which are divisive if you are angry get in contact with them not with\n\n(1:16:46) me I didn't say it they said it every single statement in the Masonic quiz book The question is asked who was nimrod the answer is he was the son of kush in the old constitutions refer to as one of the founders of masonry I thought he was a warrior before the Lord against the Lord and in the scriptures as the\n\n(1:17:08) architect of many cities in the York manuscript we find at the making of the Tower of Babel there was masonry first much esteemed of and Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Masons so Mason is nothing other than a harborer of the occult knowledge clothing themsel with all their good deeds and there are\n\n(1:17:33) many many members who they use maliciously and lie to so that they might appear Noble these people are wicked at the highest level Masonic author Kenneth McKenzie tells us that Hermes was also one of the founders of masonry her M they use the words like this like raes for examples son of RA raes mes means\n\n(1:18:07) son of son of her her ham if you like Helena Petna blaski links Hermes and Satan together so you have to piece the puzzle together it's very tricky to find out what masonry teaches you have to go from one source to another because no one author will tell you everything so let's piece it together so the one author says Hermes is the one\n\n(1:18:33) that's important to them blasi says Hermes is the god of wisdom called tat set set Satan and that he was furthermore when viewed under his bad aspect Typhon of the Egyptian Satan who was also set so when they say they have set that Satan if they say Hermes that's Satan in his luciferian form doesn't matter could be\n\n(1:18:58) male female who cares one or the other Arthur Edward White rights in regard to masonry Babel of course represented a masonic Enterprise and the early expositors reaped full benefit from that fact they remembered that the people who were of one language and one speech journeyed from the East to the West like\n\n(1:19:19) those who have tried and proved as M the Masons when they reached an Abiding Place in the land of shinai affirmed that they dwelt therein as Noah being first characteristic name of Masons it was here that they built the high tower of confusion out of evil comes good aha so God was evil when he confused the languages but they will\n\n(1:19:43) turn it back to good have you got that and the way to achieve that is to rub them up in chaos destroy them use them as gun fodder kill them do whatever you like make the pain of Separation so great that you will beg for Unity have you all got that it was here that they built the high tower of confusion out of evil\n\n(1:20:08) comes good however and the confusions of tongues gave rise to the ancient practice of Masons conversing without the use of speech so if you're going to confuse us with languages we'll use symbols so symbolism is a masonic language today people tell me but the symbols are everywhere hello what does that tell you\n\n(1:20:34) who's in control everywhere The Druids of Britain and Gaul had a deep knowledge concerning the mysteries of Isis and worshiped her under the symbol of the Moon the Moon was chosen for Isis because of its do domination over water the droods consider the son to be father and moon the mother of all things secret\n\n(1:20:53) teachings of the ages so The Druids are the ones who control Great Britain Wiston Churchill belonged to the drudik order of Freemason re was a 33 degree Freemason and I photographed his apron in case someone doesn't believe that and so we start finding little titbits of history that make sense as you enter the lodge in England you have\n\n(1:21:21) to cross the pentagram and if you look up you have this statue at the top it's a shield and there's a Chevron over there do you see it let's make it a little bit bigger there it is chevron chevron chevron do you find it on some caruse maybe just just for interest sake and then of course you have other symbolism over here and you\n\n(1:21:47) have even the Ark of the Covenant because he wants to be like the most high but he's covering cherubs have got what kind feet goat's feet this is Satanism that's why in masonry you ride the goats there are many jokes about riding the goats there are many fun postcards they make fun of it they have the goat singing hymns they have the\n\n(1:22:13) goat doing this riding the goat this and that it's a symbol of Lucifer we'll see later that they say goats go to heaven sheep go to hell interesting the Bible says in Ephesians 58-14 for you were once Darkness but now you are light in the Lord live as children of light for the fruit of the light consists in all\n\n(1:22:40) goodness righteousness and truth and find out what pleases the Lord have nothing to do with the fruitless Deeds of Darkness but rather expose them I think we did that tonight I don't want anything to do with it but to expose it is necessary for it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in\n\n(1:23:05) secret but everything exposed By the Light becomes visible for it is light that makes everything visible what a beautiful word of God we have no hidden agendas Jesus says I have done nothing in secret I love the god of the Bible and the mere fact that I am still alive shows that God is Almighty what a\n\n(1:23:36) wonderful God we serve what a kind God we serve I would not want to give up serving him for all that satanic wealth of this world what does it mean it means nothing Jesus is coming soon and the kingdom of darkness will have had his shot and it will walk over the bloodstained Earth that it has marauded and tortured\n\n(1:24:02) for the centuries and centuries in wars and battles but the word of God has remained through all that time the word of God stands like a rock the last thing that stands in his way what a war he has fought against the word of God God and I would like you to come to the next lectures because we're going to see\n\n(1:24:31) what he has done and it will be fascinating fascinating so tomorrow night we're going to talk about what they did with the Bibles the battle of the Bibles

  "# Title:213_battle_of_the_bibles_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nBible Translation History,Manuscript Corruption,Theological Disagreements,Jesuit Influence,Modern Bible Issues\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, \"Battle of the Bibles,\" delves into the historical controversy surrounding different biblical manuscripts and translations, particularly focusing on the perceived conflict between the \"received text\" (Textus Receptus) and more modern versions. The speaker argues that two main streams of biblical texts exist, with the vast majority of older, widely accepted Bibles stemming from the received text, while a smaller, more recently discovered collection of manuscripts (like the Vaticanus and Sinaiticus) forms the basis for many modern translations. The core argument highlights concerns that these newer translations, influenced by figures like Westcott and Hort, may undermine fundamental Christian doctrines such as the deity of Christ and the substitutionary atonement, introducing concepts like purgatory and a more pantheistic view of humanity. The lecture further suggests a deliberate effort by various groups, including Jesuits and Freemasons, to corrupt the biblical text to align with their own theological or occult beliefs, presenting this as an ongoing spiritual battle.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 213 - Battle of the Bibles / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9clXn_tkZU\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] Go. All right. [Music] [Music] Oh, hey. [Music] Well, this evening's lecture is about the battle of the Bibles. We won't really be going into the Bible directly tonight. We'll be looking at the history in this battle. And tomorrow night, we'll be looking at the Bible itself. So don't forget to bring your\n\n(01:24) Bibles. Tomorrow night, what is this battle all about? You will know that in the past the Bible was a very, very important issue and there were wars fought over this Bible and the church of the Middle Ages banned the Bible. And today everybody seems quite satisfied that everybody has a Bible. So has\n\n(01:47) attitude changed or has something else changed? Matthew 4:4 But he answered and said, \"It is written, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.\" Obviously, it's important that we know the word of God. Isaiah 8:20 says, \"To the law and to the testimony, if they\n\n(02:20) speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.\" In other words, if you do not speak according to the word of God and if you do not speak according to the testimony that which the prophets have iterated regarding God's actions which had to be in harmony with the Torah, the first five books of the\n\n(02:47) Bible, then there is no light in them. So don't come with something contrary to the word of God. Revelations 22:18 says,\"For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, if any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this\n\n(03:08) book. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book.\" That's pretty serious. Now today we have many Bibles and there are hosts of translations of\n\n(03:26) the Bibles. Now which one is the best? They will tell you that the modern ones are the best. And yes, in many ways with the modern Greek scholarship, a lot of the verses in the modern Bibles have better translations than in the old versions because of better knowledge of the Greek terminology. But if the grammar is improved, does\n\n(03:52) that necessarily mean that the context have has to be improved or changed? That's when you get into trouble. So what is the family tree of the modern Bibles which we have in the world today? The original manuscripts of all Bibles have been lost. They don't exist anymore. So all we have is copies of copies. Some of them are very old. Some\n\n(04:22) of them are less old. And there are basically three although we will actually see there are only two really streams of Bibles. You the ones that are uh at the base in other words the oldest ones are all lost manuscripts. So they are all copies of previous manuscripts. Now as far as the Bible that led to the King James version in\n\n(04:52) the English language, they come from the central tree. These are they they are lost manuscripts of the traditional text and they come basically from the Syriak from the Gothic virgin versions. There's a codeex W and a codeex A. And then there is a vast majority of extent texts which make up the New Testament\n\n(05:17) manuscripts. And we're talking about 1,900 manuscripts in this central block from which eventually we have the King James version and every other Bible except the Roman Catholic and the Jesuit Bible. Every single Bible in the world that was written before 1914, every single one comes from here. Then there\n\n(05:46) are two other streams. The one is the uh the one that le led to the due version which is basically the Jesuit version and the ancestor of western family that is lost and the text is an expansion of an original text and there you have the old Latin version. You have the Latin Vulgate version which the pope declared\n\n(06:10) to be infallible. You have codeex D, CEXD2, codeex E2 and the dua version of 1582 which was written to counteract the reformation. That's the one stream and manuscripts belonging to the same family have the same text. They all agree closely in the wording. Then there's another tree which is the ancestor of the Alexandrian\n\n(06:34) family and the original is also lost of course as we see. And there you have a few interesting documents and these are relatively new but they are old documents. They have been found lately. Papyrus 75, CEX B are two of them. Then you have Papyrus 66 and then the most famous of them all CEX Alf. And\n\n(07:01) from this very small stream of four manuscripts, you have the Revised Version, the American Standard Version, the Revised Standard Version, and the New English Bible, and all the hosts of new ones that are coming out in all the languages of the world are based on these manuscripts over here. So in the\n\n(07:23) central block you have thousands of manuscripts but the this particular one over here CEX Alf is one of the very oldest that there is and of course the old Latin versions and the vulgate also based on relatively old documents now. So all of them come from old documents. The oldest ones that we have come from this stream over here.\n\n(07:52) Does old necessarily mean good? Today we equate old with good? Now old does not necessarily mean good. That's a very important point to remember. If we look at this central one over here with thousands of copies in all the languages of the world just about then this is a very interesting point. If I have a\n\n(08:19) franchise, let's say I have developed a new brand of chicken to sell to someone and I have a wonderful recipe which I'm now going to base a franchise on and I send it to every country in the world and they're going to follow this recipe by the letter and we're going to sell uh blue pumpkin chicken or whatever in this\n\n(08:45) franchise. Now everybody gets the original recipe and diligently translates it because the Germans need it in German and the Portuguese need it in Portuguese and the Spanish in Spanish etc. So each one diligently copies it and now there are literally thousands of copies in various languages of the original one that was written and sent\n\n(09:10) out. Over the years the original one gets copied so many times that it it falls apart. So all you have is copies. That's all you have. And then one day somebody says to himself, \"You know, that's a pretty good recipe. I wish I could just change it a little bit and steal this franchise for myself.\" So he\n\n(09:32) alters the recipe and says, \"Hello folks, I've got the original recipe. Here it is.\" You know, he burns it a little bit and makes it look old and what have you. Not that this happened here, but anyway, he's got the original man, the original recipe, and he starts his franchise with the new recipe. Now, everybody says,\n\n(09:52) \"Wow, which one is now the original one? This one or that one?\" This is highly problematic. Now, we have two. Which one is the right one? But what do you do? You say, \"Now, hang on a second. The original one has been copied and translated in so many different languages. Let's get the German one and the Spanish one and the Greek one and\n\n(10:11) the this one and the Armenian one and the Serbian one and we'll check it out. And lo and behold, they all agree with this one, but not with that one. Which one was then the original one? The one that has the cloud of witnesses supporting it. Yes or no? Okay. And that you'll find only in the central stream. There's a cloud of\n\n(10:32) witnesses in the central stream. I mean, there are just 1,900 documents there alone that all agree. Now, the originals have been copied so many times they're gone. But, and now this is interesting, in this stream over here, there are many verses gone, just absolutely gone. And in this stream over here, there are many\n\n(10:55) verses that are just gone that are in this stream over here. Now, we don't have the original manuscripts. So the the the followers of this stream say, \"Aha, they weren't in the original.\" After all, these are old documents. And this stream says they weren't in the original. You see what they're saying? But what if you had very ancient\n\n(11:20) letters from the church fathers, which often obviously weren't as copied as much as the Bible was as a document. And you have very ancient letters from very ancient church fathers writing to each other. Now if I write a letter to my wife for example, I'm sitting in this country and she's in another country and\n\n(11:40) I write her a nice letter and I'm encouraging her giving her a few quotes out of the Bible that everybody does. Isn't that so? So we have these ancient letters and there are quotes of verses which don't happen to appear there but the letters are older than those manuscripts. Then which one would be the\n\n(12:01) right one? Which one would you suggest? Then obviously the ones that are in line with here the center because they're quoting verses they don't even exist in those. That is the case. That's how it is. So why do we have these three streams and what is it all about? Now Cortalant who is co-editor of both of\n\n(12:20) the most widely used critical Greek texts and who is certainly the leading textual scholar on the European continent proposes that the texts of P75 and B in that Alexandrian stream represent a revision of a local text of Egypt which was enforced as the dominant text in that area. So basically we don't\n\n(12:41) have four we just have two and the one is just a modification of the other. So basically there's just one document in that left stream and that is that syneticus text. We'll come to that in a moment. Then uh David Otus says fundamentally there are only two streams of Bibles. The first stream which carried\n\n(13:04) the received text in Hebrew and Greek. Precious manuscripts were preserved by such as the church at Pella in Palestine where Christians fled when in 70 AD the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. So the original manuscripts were not in Rome. They came from the Christian area. They came from Jerusalem. They came from Syria there\n\n(13:30) where the apostles preached. That's where the original manuscripts were. And that's the logical place for them to be because that's where the apostles were. Isn't that right? By the Syrian church of Antioch which produced eminent scholarship by the Italic church in northern Italy. And also by the way the Christians in\n\n(13:52) northern Italy previously received their scriptures from the Middle Eastern route and not from Rome. And there was a major problem between the Ostrogoths and those in Rome because they had different scriptures. Very interesting. So, northern Italy had the same as those in the Middle Eastern regions. And also at\n\n(14:17) the same time by the GIC church in southern France and by the Celtic church in Great Britain, the prevalenzians and the Valdenzians and the Reformation, they all had the same basic manuscripts. These manuscripts have in agree with agreement with them the vast majority of all the copies of the original text. So\n\n(14:37) that central stream this is called the received text or the textos recepticos. So vast is this majority that even the enemies of the received text admit that the 1920th of all Greek manuscripts are of this class. Just about everyone is of that class. Then there's a second stream which is a very small one and it's based\n\n(15:02) on ancient manuscripts. Let's not doubt that. And they represent in Greek the Vatican manuscript or codeex B in the library at Rome. And this one was used to counteract the reformation because it says different things to the one that the reformers used. So at the time of of the reformation codeex B became very\n\n(15:28) prominent and then we have the synetic text or codeex alf. Now that is one that was found in Alex in the region of Egypt. Uh I'll show you the place later and it comes from an Alexandrian text. So we have this one and it was found in a very interesting date. It was found in 1844. 1844. So this is the youngest find of\n\n(15:57) all the ancient manuscripts and it is a very old document. So when it says in your new Bibles that this translation is based on ancient manuscripts then the idea is planted that ancient means good. Are you with me? But ancient doesn't necessarily mean good. It just means ancient. That's all it means. In Latin, there's the Vulgate or\n\n(16:28) Latin Bible of Jerome, 383 AD. That's pretty old. And uh there are some problems with that as we will see just now as well. In English, there's the Jesuit Bible of 1582 that was written in the vulgar tongue, if you like, to counteract the Reformation Bible, which later with vast changes is seen in the dua or Catholic Bible, which\n\n(16:53) is the one on which the Good News Bible and all of those are based today and in English again in many modern Bibles. The present controversy between the King James Bible in English and the modern version is the same old contents fought out between the early church rival sects. So the early church had this\n\n(17:13) battle because these ancient manuscripts are different and the modern church has this battle. So both of them had the battle. There was a battle in the beginning. There was a war in the middle when the reformation came out. a literal war eventually over this word. And now we have another battle looming in our\n\n(17:36) time. The final battle. This will be the last one. I think that's my opinion. So the battle was waged between the Valdenzis and the papists from the 4th to the 13th century and later between the reformers and the Jesuits in the 16th century. And today the battle is going to be waged between whoever represents the Bibles that these people\n\n(18:03) also defended and whoever represents the other side. We need to understand that many of the new translations are taken from old manuscripts. No doubt as I've explained people think that these are more reliable. No, they're just old. In actual fact, they are saying, now listen carefully, that a manuscript that was\n\n(18:24) found in a waste paper basket in a cave at Mount Si and questionable manuscripts from Alexandria where you had all this occultism are more reliable than the received texts. That's what they're saying. So these questionable ones are more reliable. In fact, the one found at Mount Si was thrown away because it had\n\n(18:45) been copied over, rubbed out, and judging by the the science of looking at how many times pe pieces had been rubbed out and rewritten. It seems that it has been rubbed out and rewritten in many places up to 70 times. In fact, it was so rubbed out and rewritten that they threw it away. But that is the manuscript on\n\n(19:08) which everything is based today. as reliable. Now, where do these manuscripts come from? Now, there's a man by the name of Oregon who was an old initiate. We'll find him in the Masonic writings as an insider initiates. That's interesting. If I find somebody praised in the Masonic writings, my ears prick\n\n(19:31) up. He was a textual critic and he's supposed to have corrected numerous portions of the sacred manuscripts. Now this is in ancient ancient times. Evidence to the contrary shows that he changed them to agree with his human philosophy of mystical and allegorical ideas. For example, he believed that man\n\n(19:51) was divine and therefore there was not just one divine man that came to this earth. We are all divine which is Masonic teaching even to this day. And so they believe that these manuscripts actually were corrupted. So from the birth of Christ to about 400 AD some Gnostic gospels appeared and other writings were written. Paul makes\n\n(20:17) mention of this and he says in 2 Corinthians 2:1 17 for we are not as many which corrupt the word of God. So in Paul's time were they corrupting the word of God? Yes or no? Yes, they were corrupting it and they were corrupting it with gnostic ideas and this is to bring them in line with an ecumenical\n\n(20:39) thinking that all religions are basically the same. We shouldn't elevate one above another in 331 AD and this is where the problem really starts. Now Constantine ordered an ecumenical Bible. You see, Christianity was saying Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. And all the doctrines regarding to\n\n(21:06) Christianity were problematic because they were in the face of paganism. And so, Constantine who tried to marry the two, he commissioned a man by the name of who was by the way a follower of Oregon to write an ecumenical Bible. that is to change the word of God using Gnostic writings so that it would be acceptable to pagans as\n\n(21:34) well as to Christians and that's what they did but the early Christians rejected these manuscripts and said they are not from God and so they went into secret libraries and there they lay later to be dug up as ancient manuscripts There were about 50 copies made by Ucius and they were distributed and they ended\n\n(22:03) up largely in two areas namely in Rome and in Alexandria where you had the esoteric um studies for example we'll go into that a little bit later and Oregon believed in the so-called Aryan heresy now the Aryan heresy is that Jesus was not God and uh that God is basically if you like a form of pantheistic God in\n\n(22:34) everything. So we basically could also have a divine spark in us which is Masonic teaching. Now it's interesting that Roman Catholicism claims that it's anti-aran and that it fought wars and destroyed people that were Aryan. There is no evidence. Let me tell you now, there is no historic evidence that the\n\n(22:56) nations that were destroyed because they were Aryan like the Ostrogoths for example or the Vandals that they were actually Aryan because we have none of their writings. Every piece of their literature has been destroyed. We only have the word of Roman Catholicism that they were Aryan. But now I have some interesting\n\n(23:16) news for you. Remember I told you yesterday that the templars have two doctrines. One is exoteric and one is esoteric. One is for the goyam for the cattle and one is for the insiders. Now the gospel to the outside is non-aran but the insider gospel of Roman Catholicism is Aryan. Now what do you do with that? And how do I know that it's\n\n(23:43) Aryan? It's because the pope has declared the Vulgate as an infallible Bible and the Vulgate is Aryan. It removes the deity of Christ. Isn't that interesting? So what's the battle about? The battle is about Jesus Christ just as it was since prehistory. The battle is about the son of God. And who are we\n\n(24:07) going to defend? Jesus or someone else? So this is an interesting battle. I find this a fascinating battle. 1481 AD, the Vatican manuscript was discovered in the Vatican library. Isn't that interesting? Just in time to counter the Reformation. Just in time. Because the Reformation was using the received text. There was\n\n(24:32) no other text. So you must now believe that up until 1481, God had kept the truth of the Bible away from all generations up to 1481. They all were based on wrong manuscripts. And fortunately, the Vatican discovered the right manuscript in 1481 to counter the Reformation. And this manuscript repeatedly sets aside the deity of\n\n(25:02) Christ and its Aryan. So that is inside a doctrine. This is Templar doctrine because we saw it yesterday in the lecture that we did yesterday. And it is probably a manuscript that survived from Ucius. And by the way, this one and the one that they found at Sinai are birds of a feather that flock together. They are\n\n(25:27) very much the same. So that's why there are basically only two streams. The vast majority text recepticus and then this stream. And then the magic date 1844. The synetic manuscript is discovered at Mount Si in a monastery in St. Catherine's. Very interesting. That's the old Coptic church which is basically\n\n(25:52) the Eastern Bzantine church which was exactly the same as Catholicism because they were one and the same and it agrees absolutely with a Vatican manus manuscript and it is totally Aryan. By 1881, two professors from Britain, West Cotton and Hort created the Greek text and uh this is based of course on these\n\n(26:20) manuscripts on the Vatican manuscript and the Sinai manuscript leaning heavily on the Sinai manuscript so that it wouldn't appear too overly Catholic. Are you with me? Mustn't appear too overly Catholic because these were Protestants. Well, let's rather say they were supposedly Protestants and the Jehovah's Witness\n\n(26:42) Bible was then changed as a result of this new writing. Now, this was in the early 1900s when these things started coming out and the Jehovah's Witnesses had no other Bible than the King James. So, one day they were told, \"Take your King James Bibles.\" And as they came in, they were given a thick black\n\n(27:05) pen. And they were told, \"Now, let's modify the King James. Cross out. Zap, zap, zap, zap, zap, whatever it is.\" And they crossed out. They didn't have their Bible. It didn't exist in the early 1900s. So, the Jehovah's Witnesses were the first to just cross out huge sections of the Bible. I'll show you\n\n(27:28) that tomorrow night, what they crossed out. And it must be emphasized that the argument is therefore not between an ancient text and a recent one but between two ancient texts. Are you with me? That's the argument. And uh well it's an interesting one. Now Tindle, he of course used the received text and\n\n(27:48) this really irritated the Vatican because the other one hadn't been found yet by the way. And he used the received text in his Bible and said to the pope, \"If God spare my life before many years, I will cause a boy that driveth a plow to know more about the scriptures than thou doest.\" That was quite a\n\n(28:10) statement. Once again, I would like to reiterate the argument is not King James versus other versions. The argument is received texttos recepticus versus the small little stream that comes from Sinai and the Vatican. That's the argument. By the way, any Bible in any language that existed before the 1900s is received\n\n(28:41) text. So if you go to Serbia, they have the received text. If you go to Greece, they have the receive text in Greek. If you go to any country in the world, the Lutheran Bible, any Bible, they're all based on received text. Every single one. But after 1900, the modern ones are no longer based on that. Well, when this Bible came out,\n\n(29:05) the Jesuits were called in to help. Big crisis. Because now it was plain that the teaching of Rome was not in accordance with the Bible. And this is one of their statements. Notice what the Jesuits wrote. We must undermine the Bible of the Protestants and destroy their teachings. The Queen of England\n\n(29:24) realizing the damage the Jesuit Bible could do. Sent to Europe for Bizar who was with John Calvin to help Cartwright to write this new uh manuscript. uh he took hold of the Greek manuscripts and the Latin manuscripts from the received text and he hit the Jesuit Bible blow after the blow. So war broke out. So eventually they\n\n(29:51) sent the Spanish Armada against England to make war and they came with 136 armed ships with 50 cannons and all England had was a measly 30 ships. These huge galleys came. They were going to flatten England because of this Bible. Well, Sir Francis Drake got up that morning. He must have been very nervous. But what did he find? A storm\n\n(30:19) had come up in the night and the Spanish galleys lay smashed upon the shores as high up as Scotland. The entire fleet destroyed in the storm. And all that he had to do was mop up. And from that day, England became a great sea power. That's history. Now, what did the Jesuits say about the Bible? Here's the quote. Then\n\n(30:43) the Bible that serpent which is with its head erect and eyes flashing flashing threatens us with its venom while it trails along the ground shall be challenged into a rod, changed into a rod as soon as we are able to seize it. For three centuries past, this cruel asp has left us no repose. You well know\n\n(31:03) with what folds it entwines us and with what fangs it ignores us. They hate it. The Bible, the Jesuit Catechism, there is the quote says, \"Question, what if the holy scriptures command one thing and the pope another contrary to it?\" Answer: The Holy Scriptures must be thrown aside. What is the Pope? He is the vicer\n\n(31:27) of Christ, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, and there is but one judgment seat belonging to God. and the pope. That's quite a statement. Now, what does Freemasonry say? It's always nice to have the comparative documents. Morals and dogma, the source, page 818, regarding the Bible, Pike writes, the absurd reading of the established\n\n(31:50) church, taking literally the figurative, allegorical, and mythical language of a collection of oriental books of different ages. He's pretty derogatory. The folly of regarding the Hebrew books as if they had been written by the unimaginative hard practical intellect of the England of James I and the\n\n(32:12) bigoted solidity of Scottish Presbyterianism. Boy, he didn't like that translation. He hated it. And how did he feel about the Templars and the Jesuit version? The better to succeed and win partisans. The Templars sympathized with regrets for dethroned creeds. They sympathized with paganism and encouraged the hopes of new\n\n(32:36) worships, promising to all liberty of conscience and a new orthodoxy that should be synthesis of all the persecuted creeds. So you see, Freemasonry hates the received text. It has it in its lodge purely as a symbol. That's so clever. That's so diabolical, isn't it? That's ah, forget it. Going back to the time of the early church, we\n\n(33:05) find Coptic versions, Latin versions, Syrian versions, and they were circulated long before the Vaticanis appeared. So then come two Cambridge professors who did not even believe in verbal inspiration of the scriptures. West Cotton Horn and they're going to change everything. Now, by the way, Jerome's Bible, which\n\n(33:28) is the one that is used in the Vatican, the Latin Vulgate, how could Helvidius, a contemporary, have accused Jerome of employing corrupt Greek manuscripts if Halvidius had not had pure Greek manuscripts. So while Jerome was writing this Latin Bible, other scholars were already saying, \"Hey, you're using\n\n(33:51) corrupt manuscripts for this.\" So this battle is an ancient battle. It's not a new battle. So these revised versions are based on manuscripts from Egypt that were definitely corrupted. That's what most of the critics say. One of the greatest critics of all time is Dean Bergen. And when this great man died, then\n\n(34:16) corruption took hold. He was a bastion. Bergen writes, \"The work of the evangelists, apostles, apostles recognized as the necessary counterpart and complement of God's ancient scripture become the New Testament.\" And then he says, \"It received as good a reception as did Jesus Christ himself.\" They nailed Jesus to the cross. would\n\n(34:39) note they nailed his word to the cross as well. That's basically what he says restless malice and unsparing assaults against the word of God from the very beginning. And he what does he say about these manuscripts that were found? He says we oppose facts to their speculation. They exalt be and alf and\n\n(35:00) D8 because in their own opinions these copies are the best. They weave ingenious webs and invent subtle theories because their paradox of a few against the many requires ingenuity and subtlety for its support. Very good writer. He took them apart. I am utterly disincined to believe continuous deeds and so grossly improbable does it seem\n\n(35:24) that at the end of 1,800 years 995 copies out of every thousand suppose will prove untrustworthy and that the one two three four or five which remain whose contents were still yesterday as good as unknown will be found to have retained the secret of what the Holy Spirit originally inspired. ired interesting\n\n(35:49) point of view. He further goes on to say, \"What in the meantime is to be thought of those blind guides, those deluded ones who would now, if they could persuade us to go back to those same cotices of which the church had already purged herself, go back to those ancient manuscripts.\" And he takes Tishandoff, the man who\n\n(36:11) discovered this manuscript, takes him apart, takes Trigalis apart, Hort apart, and uh shows that he thoroughly disagrees with their scholarship. And then this interesting statement, who but those with Roman Catholic sympathies could ever be pleased with the notion that God preserved the true New Testament text in secret for almost\n\n(36:36) 1,000 years. and then finally handed over to the Roman pontiff for safekeeping. That's what it boils down to. That's literally what it boils down to. Dr. Hoskia quotes from Dr. Salmon. He says, \"Naturally, Hort regarded these manuscripts as most trustworthy which give the reading recognized by Oregon.\"\n\n(36:57) See, that's what they did. Hort the professor from England, he was an Oregon follower. And we will have to prove that. We can't just make statements like that. You will always be my friend, but I can no longer ignore the criticism. This is Dr. Frank Lockson to F Lachman, one of the great translators\n\n(37:18) himself. I cannot refute them. And dear brother, I have not a thing against you, but the only thing I can do under God is to renounce every attachment to the New American Standard Bible. So, here's one of the committee detaching himself personally. Well, let's go to Alexandria and see what we can find. Here is the\n\n(37:39) statue of Horus, the secret of the initiated ones. Horus and Isis and Dionius. These secrets were kept alive at Alexandria and the Alexandrian library was worldworld world famous for its occult documents. Then of course the very early Christians who were Bible-based got rid of that terrible uh information place and they\n\n(38:10) burnt the old Alexandrian library to the ground which was a catastrophe for the occult world. Well, fortunately, UNESCO, this is very interesting, UNESCO, whose constitution was written by a skull and bones member just for instant interest sake, decided to restore it and rebuild it in exactly the same spot. There it is\n\n(38:33) today. And uh the lamps that they've put down, they have interesting stuff on them like little angels carrying cornucopias, which we discussed yesterday. If you go and look at the library, it is huge and it has all the pagan inscriptions on it that the original library had on it. It is made according to the model. All the pagan\n\n(38:58) petroglyphs and the ancient sun worship symbols are on it. And this is Demetrius of Falerium, the founder of the Alexandrian library. In it, they still have some of the ancient manuscripts that happened to escape. Here you have papyrus of the zodiac sign, something that the Bible forbids. Here you have a\n\n(39:19) piece of the book of the dead, which is the Egyptian book of the dead, which is the counterpart to what the Bible teaches. It exalts the God of the dead. The Bible exalts the God of the living. Then you have these petetroglyphs here, which are too disgusting, so let's just go away. And they have the deities in their hexagons\n\n(39:41) and Socrates and ancient mystic. Socrates of course died from drinking hemlock. He was an initiate and he released some of the secrets. And according to the oath if you do that, you can die of the poison cup if you choose or you could have your throat slit from ear to ear and uh your tongue ripped out of your mouth. He chose the\n\n(40:04) hemlock. The dead are exalted. This library is absolutely enormous. One cannot even imagine how big it is. I made one small video of it. Let's have a look what it looks like just to give you an idea of the size. It's absolutely enormous. And uh all the interesting pagan symbols are there. A total replica of what once must\n\n(40:31) have existed there. Well, just to show that I was there because otherwise people think I wasn't taken from high up in the library. It was opened by uh Mubarak in 2002. It's spanking new. Spanking new. I had to go and see it. I had to go and photograph it. And uh here they have a statue of Prometheus bearing\n\n(40:54) the fire according to the occult writings. That's Lucifer, the lightbearer. and some of the symbols on the walls on the retaining walls. Now let's just have a look at some of the manuscripts which Rome says are essential for um understanding the greater gospel and Rome placed the Bible and that is only the textus recepticus\n\n(41:23) by the way on the index of prohibited books. They didn't place their vulgate on the index of prohibited books. It's the Protestant Bible that they placed there. So the early church of Antioch, as I've already said, used these Syrian manuscripts and this is a book that uh is forbidden by Rome. The Septuagant on\n\n(41:45) the other hand was made for Alexandria for the library there in 285 BC. So interesting um data. The apocryphal books that means hidden things. The Council of Trent said the following in 1546. Whoever shall not receive as sacred and canonical all these books and every part of them as they are commonly\n\n(42:12) read in the Catholic Church and are contained in the old Vulgate Latin edition or shall knowingly and deliberately despise the foret traditions. Let him be accursed. So they said we must accept all of these manuscripts. Let's briefly run through them. Let's go to Tobias 6 4-8 where it says, \"Open the fish and\n\n(42:36) take the heart and the liver and the gall. If a devil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall no longer be vexed. As for the Gaul, it is good to anoint the man that has witness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.\" So if you want to\n\n(42:52) drive away evil spirits, demons, then wave the gall of a fish and make a smoke thereof, and it'll go away. The Bible says, \"And signs will follow those believing these things in my name they shall cast out demons.\" Mark 16:17. Acts 16:18 says, \"Being distressed and turning to the demonic spirit,\" Paul\n\n(43:13) said, \"I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\" And it came out that hour. So he didn't use the gallbladder of a fish. Tobias 12:9 says, \"For arms does deliver from death and shall purge away sin.\" Oh, that's nice. So you can pay to get your sins taken away. Peter says, \"For as much as you know that you were\n\n(43:36) not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers.\" Two opposing doctrines. Which one is right? Do you think you can buy your way to heaven? Prayer to the dead. Mcabade back Mcabes 12:43-46. For if he had not hoped that they were slain, would he have risen\n\n(43:57) again? It had been superfluous and vain to pray for the dead. Whereupon he made reconciliation for the dead that they might be delivered from sin. So you can pray for the dead that they are delivered from sin. This is paganism. John 1:7 says, \"Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin. There's no such thing.\"\n\n(44:21) That brings us to the Vulgate Bible 1545 to 1563. That was the one which was declared infallible. Now what does the Vulgate say? Our Bible says all scripture is God breathed. The dua which is based on the Vulgate says all scriptures inspired of God is profitable. So only some scripture is inspired. Hebrews 11:21\n\n(44:47) says, \"Jacob worshiped as he leaned on top of his staff.\" The Vulgate says, \"Jacob adored the top of his rod.\" That means you can pray to a relic. You can pray to a statue. That's where they get their doctrine from. It also says in Revelation, in the received text, blessed are they, oh no, this is Codex Vaticanis. Blessed are they which\n\n(45:11) wash their robes. But the King James says, \"Blessed are they that do his commandments.\" Well, the Dead Sea Scrolls, these were writings meticulously copied by the Essenes. The ancient manuscripts that they copied were exactly like those found in the Bible today. So, they proved that the Bible had not changed in all this time.\n\n(45:37) And these manuscripts were very exciting. But then some other interesting manuscripts have been found besides this famous uh one that was found near Alexandria. And that is a whole series of Gnostic gospels. And Time magazine reported on these some time ago. Words from the past. 46 scriptures dug up near\n\n(46:04) Nagamadi in Egypt in 1945 changed views of early Christianity. Now interestingly Egypt was the seat of the occult science and these were buried to keep them safe from whom? Obviously, the early Christianity that destroyed that ancient pagan library and these manuscripts have now been found since 1945 and are changing\n\n(46:36) the world view. Some Buddhists are saying had we known that Christianity had such manuscripts, we'dn't even have been Buddhists. Well, what do these manuscripts say? These are the so-called lost gospels that are so famous today. You have the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Peter, and all these wonderful\n\n(46:55) manuscripts throwing lights on what the early Christians believe. Well, there were Ebianites, there were Marchonites, there were Gnostics, there were Thomases. All of them basically believed in the deity of man and the non-exclusive deity of Jesus Christ. All of them. Let's read what the Gospel of Peter had\n\n(47:18) to say that was dug up and you tell me whether you think this is trustworthy. Well, let's read it. By the way, these uh gnostic writings are apocryphal and therefore they are sacred. The cross talked and walked. Jesus had died the day before uttering his last words. My power, oh power, you have left me behind. His body was taken\n\n(47:43) down and placed in the tomb. But now as the Sabbath dawned, oops. Which day is now the Sabbath? Sunday has become the Sabbath. Here the Sabbath as Sunday was kept only in Alexandria in the Egyptian realm and in Rome. The rest of the world kept Sabbath, the seventh day. So in this one, the Sabbath has moved to Sunday.\n\n(48:08) Sabbath dawned, a great voice came from the sky. Is that trustworthy? Well, let's see how rest how trustworthy the rest is. A great voice came from the sky and two men descended. The stone blocking the tomb rolled away of its own accord. The Bible doesn't say that. And while Roman soldiers gaped, three men\n\n(48:26) emerged from the tomb. Two of them supporting the other. Oh, Jesus couldn't walk when he came out. His resurrection was, you know, not quite that illustrious. With a cross following behind. Oh, all by itself. Was the cross buried with him? No. the cross walked behind. Why? Because they made the cross a very\n\n(48:45) prominent symbol in those days. The heads of the two reached up to the sky, but the head of the one they were leading went up above the sky. And they heard a voice, \"Have you preached to those who are sleeping?\" So here we have doctrine of preaching to the dead. And a reply came from the cross. Yes. Do you\n\n(49:05) trust this gospel? If you do, I feel sorry for you. I think it belongs where that other one was found in the trash. Let me take you to Sinai. Well, I was interested to go to St. Catherine's where this manuscript, this famous manuscript on which all modern translations are based was found. Here it is, St. Katherine's\n\n(49:28) protectorate. This is the monastery, the famous monastery. Here are the skulls of the monks that uh were active there. And if you like, you can pray to them and get a blessing. They will answer you. Apparently, I I didn't see any possibility of answering me. They had no breath in them. But nevertheless, you\n\n(49:49) can if you want to. This is Sinai. So they say and in the church you find the symbols of sun and moon and all the pagan symbols. the famous Sinai library uh where this was found where you have all these ancient handwritten codices these ancient manuscripts and the famous codec synicus which was found by\n\n(50:14) Tishonorf in 1844. So there we have it. So it was handed over to Catholic scholars in 1844 and uh from the University of Lee interesting date that's CDC and there you have some of the ancient manuscripts that are in that place and uh some interesting history about this monastery. The bene benevolent treatment of the monastery of\n\n(50:43) Sinai by the Arabs. It was never destroyed by the Arabs. So Islam had no quarrel with them. Who took the peninsula in the seventh century is due to the patent of Muhammad and its protection with rights and privileges which prophet Muhammad founder of Islam granted to the monks of the monastery of Sinai. So Muhammad protected this\n\n(51:05) monastery. Who else protected it? Well, here's another interesting document. Napoleon Bonapart who was a 33 degree Freemason by the way if there was such a thing in those days his brother was the grandmaster in Spain and he was a high Freemason those degrees had not yet existed at that stage to that degree but\n\n(51:26) he was one of the highest initiates he protected this monastery interesting people protected this monastery this is the famous four gospels of Codcus that's my friend over there we are going into the monastery and some of the paintings in the monastery. And then this fascinating bush over here with all these people\n\n(51:48) lining up to pray in front of this bush. This is a famous bush. In fact, this bush has survived for thousands of years and has never ever been watered. Never been watered. In fact, it is one of the most famous bushes in the history of the world. It is the famous burning bush that Moses bowed down to.\n\n(52:14) So they say. They told us it had never been watered. I was inquiring what that pipe was there. But they in insisted that it was a a dead pipe, which it was. There was no water in it, but it's a very prickly bush. So I was wondering whether there was another one behind it perhaps. Nevertheless, you can pray to the bush\n\n(52:35) and it can give you a blessing. I didn't want to pray for it. I thought maybe touching it will help but I haven't felt anything since then. Now this is the type of paganism that is being taught there. Isn't it incredible? Uh wherever the so-called counterreformation started by the Jesuits gained hold of the people, the\n\n(52:55) vernacular was suppressed and the Bible kept from the ley. So eager were the Jesuits to destroy the authority of the Bible. the paper pope of the Protestants. That's what they called it, as they contemptuously called it, that they even did not refrain from criticizing its genuous and historical value. The Jesuits made war against the\n\n(53:17) Protestant Bible. Before the English people could go the way of the continent and be brought to the question their great English Bible, the course of their thinking must first be changed. Much had to be done to discredit in their eyes the reformation, its history, doctrines, documents which they lock\n\n(53:38) looked upon as the great work of God. So this is what they had to do. They had to destroy this thinking. Now a very interesting statement and we'll see who it comes from in a moment. Despite all the persecution they the Jesuits have met with, this is a Roman Catholic speaking, they have not abandoned England where\n\n(54:00) there are a greater number of Jesuits than in Italy. Take note, greater number of Jesuits than in Italy. There are Jesuits in all classes of society, in Parliament, among the English clergy, among the Protestant leoty, even in the higher stations. I could not comprehend how a Jesuit could be a Protestant\n\n(54:20) priest or how a Protestant priest could be a Jesuit. But my confessor silenced my scruples by telling me Omnia Munda Mundes and that St. Paul became a Jew that he might save the Jews. It was no wonder, therefore, that if a Jesuit should fain himself a Protestant for the conversion of a Protestant, but pay\n\n(54:38) attention, I entreat you, to discover concerning the nature of the religious movement in England turned pusm. The English clergy were formerly too much attached to their article of faith to be shaken from them. You might have employed in vain all the machines set in motion by bos and the John senates from\n\n(54:58) France that's the ones who were you know behind the French revolution the Jesuits and all of that to reunite them with the Rish. So the Jesuits of England tried another plan. This was to demonstrate from history and ecclesiastical antiquity the legitimacy of the usage of the English church whence through the\n\n(55:19) exertion of the Jesuits concealed amongst its clergy might arise a studious attention to Christian antiquity. Who wrote this? Who wrote this that the Jesuits were the priests in the Protestant churches? It was Descontus, priest at Rome, professor of theology, official theological sensor of the Inquisition. The man himself tells us\n\n(55:48) that it was so. Now, Romanism is known to have recently entered the Church of England. Before 1833, if you held a mass like they hold it today, that was an anathema. If you did the things and said the things they said then that was an anathema. Afterwards things changed. Newman leader of the Oxford movement that's their university. Only\n\n(56:12) through the English church can you act upon the English nation. I wish of course our church should be consolidated with and through and in your communion for its sake and your sake and for the sake of unity. He and his associates believed that Protestantism was the antichrist. Okay. Farber, one of the associates of\n\n(56:33) Newman, he was also in the Oxford movement. He said, \"Protestantism is perishing. What is good in it is by God's mercy being gathered into the garners of Rome. My whole life, God willing, shall be one crusade against the detestable and diabolical heresy of Protestantism.\" So, here is a war in the English church. I believe, he said,\n\n(56:54) Antichrist will be infidel and arise out of what calls itself Protestantism. So he's just turning it around and the church of Rome in England will be united in one to oppose it. Fascinating stuff. Revelation 13:18 they changed uh they didn't change the number 666 but in the revised version they have a footnote\n\n(57:15) which says and his number is 616. Just for interest sake. Now let's get to t these two gentlemen Westcot and Hort. These are the ones that wrote based on the ancient manuscript the Greek text upon which all modern translations are based. Who were these two gentlemen and what did they believe? Now everything I'm going to say about\n\n(57:38) them comes from books written by the sons of West Cot and Hort publishing their own letters. So this is not what somebody says about them. This is they themselves saying what they believe. This is the horse's mouth. Wonderful to have quotes like that. They probably wish they had never done that after this\n\n(57:58) lecture. Hort as well as Wescott rejected the idea of infallibility of the Bible. Called the doctrine of substitutionary atonement that Jesus died for you. He called it immoral. He denied the historicity of Genesis. He praised Darin and he denied the divinity of Christ. Does it sound familiar? Who were these people?\n\n(58:20) Professor Wescott and Hort werecott was born in 1825. Hort born in 1828. They were members of the broad church, the high church party of the church of England. They became friends during their student days at Cambridge univers University work together. Wescott became bishop of Durham and Hort is best\n\n(58:40) remembered as professor of divinity at Cambridge University. Well, their doctrines are so Jesuit that I wouldn't be surprised if they were two of these illustrious gentlemen. Hort's view on evolution. He says, \"The beginning of an individual is precisely as inconceivable as the beginning of a species. It certainly\n\n(59:00) startles me to find you saying that you have seen no facts which support such a view as Darvens.\" But he was a Darvinist. and uh he says his book drove me to the conclusion that some kind of development must be supposed. So he was a Darvinist. This is a letter from Hort to McMillan. He writes another last word on\n\n(59:22) Darin. I shall not let the subject drop in a hurry or to speak more correctly it will not let me drop. And so he continues to say that he is a Darinist. Here is another letter from Hort to Wescott. Have you read Darin? How I should like to talk with you about it and another letter to Ellton. But the\n\n(59:42) book which has most engaged me is Darvin. Another letter of Hort to Ellton. I had no idea till the last few weeks of the importance of the texts. These are the new ones that had now been found. Having read so little Greek Testament and dragged on with the villainous text receptus. So he calls the received text\n\n(1:00:05) villainous. Think of that vile text receptus. Doesn't that sound like a Jesuit who hated the received text who called it that aspent leaning entirely on late manuscripts? There comes their argument. The site text was early. It is a blessing there are such early ones. Then hort to Reverend Ellton. One result\n\n(1:00:32) of our talk I may as well tell you. He Wescott and I are going to edit the Greek text of the New Testament some two or three years hence if possible. And he talks about Lman and Tishonorf who will supply the materials. And then uh he says our object is to supply clergymen generally schools etc. with a portable\n\n(1:00:52) Greek text which shall not be disfigured with Bzantine corruptions. In other words, it won't contain what the received text contains. How are they going to do this? Another letter WCOT to Hort. As to our proposed resention of the New Testament text, our object should be, I suppose, to prepare a text for common\n\n(1:01:16) and general use. With such an end in view, would it not be best to introduce only certain amendations? only change it a little bit here and a little bit there into the received text and to take note in the margin such as seem likely or noticeable of the griebach's manner. You know, if we change it completely, these British will\n\n(1:01:40) get nervous. Let's just change it here and there and write in the margin what we think is important so that when they read it and they read the manuscript margin they'll see oh yes we see that this probably shouldn't be there because an early manuscript corrupt one they don't say that it doesn't have it you see what I\n\n(1:02:03) mean that's what they decided I feel most keenly disgraced of circulating what I feel to be falsified copies of holy scripture That's a reference to the uh authorized virgin. And I'm most anxious to provide something to replace them. This cannot be any text resting solely on our own judgment, even if we\n\n(1:02:24) were not too inexperienced to make one. So he's quite willing to write another Bible all by himself. But it must be supported by a clear and obvious preponderance of evidence. The margin will give ample scope for our own ingenuity or principle. So I suggest when you read the margins, distrust them completely. My wish would be to leave\n\n(1:02:49) the popular received text except where it is clearly wrong in his opinion. Of course, then he says this interesting thing. Wescott, Goreham, Benson, Bradshaw, Lurard and I have started the society for the investigation of ghosts. Okay, they were spiritists and all supernatural appearances and effects being all\n\n(1:03:10) disposed to believe that such things really exist and ought to be discriminated from hoaxes and mere subjective delusions and uh they called it all kinds of names, and bull club etc etc. And out of this developed an incredible society. In 1882, the society for psychical research was founded. In effect, it was a combination\n\n(1:03:33) of those groups already working independently. So they work with telepathy, clairvoyance, etc. And uh this is ancient occult wisdom. and Cambridge University Ghost Society was founded by no lesser person than Edward White Benson, future Archbishop of Canterbury, together with these illustrious persons and Darin also\n\n(1:03:59) attended. Now this society, the society for psychical research is also the society which runs the esoteric side of the new age movement today with its channeling and its communication with the spirit world. All of these things are in there among the numerous persons and groups who in the middle of the 19th century\n\n(1:04:22) were making inquiries there. You will see Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Cantery, his son AC Benson, uh will be found under the year 1851 with the following paragraph. Among my father's diversions at Cambridge was the foundation of a ghost society. And then people like Lightfoot and Wescott and Hort were\n\n(1:04:46) among the members. There it is. He was then always more interested in psychical phenomenon and than he cared to admit. Very well. So the evolution from traditional mediumship to contemporary ch channeling has been gradual. The original spiritualism started in 1848. Then came the society of psychical\n\n(1:05:08) research in Britain and then Helena Petrovna Blavatski took this up and continued and she's the one that wrote Lucifer is the logos the serpent the savior. Satan is the only god of this planet. That's what she wrote. That's where it came from. The secret doctrine comes from this group. Now, did they\n\n(1:05:30) belong to any other secret societies? The answer is yes. Hort was a member of a secret society. He found time to attend the meeting of various societies and June joined the mysterious company of the apostles. He remained always a grateful and loyal member of the secret club which has now 1896 become famous for the number of\n\n(1:05:53) distinguished men who have belonged to it. In his time the club was in a manner reinvigorated and he this is Hort was mainly responsible for the wording of the oath which binds the members to a conspiracy of silence. Did he belong to a secret society? Yes or no? Yes. which binds them to silence. Does this sound masonic\n\n(1:06:18) to you? Yes or no? Well, the prime minister of England was also in there and he wrote the constitution for the League of Nations where he insisted that all religions should become one and wrote an esoteric solution to that which is also Masonic. So these people were Masons. Now we saw yesterday that the\n\n(1:06:41) high initiates believe that who is God? The devil is God. Satan is God. Lucifer is God. So, Mr. Hort, are you going to rewrite the Bible while you believe that Lucifer is the son of God? Doesn't that mean that Jesus must be made less than he is? Yes or no? Wouldn't they want to rewrite the Bible so that Jesus is\n\n(1:07:04) written out of the Constitution? Yes or no? Well, do we find that today or don't we? That's the question. I'm not going to answer it tonight. We'll answer it tomorrow. We'll see for ourselves. Bring your Bibles along. Let's have a look. 1854 to Reverend John Ellton. I agree with you in thinking it is a pity that\n\n(1:07:24) Moraurice verbally repudiates purgatory. But I fully and unwaveringly agree with him in the three cardinal points of the controversy that certain that eternity is independent of duration. That the power of repentance is not limited to this life. Can you believe this? He believes in purgatory and that you can repent on the\n\n(1:07:45) other side. That it is not revealed whether or not all will be will ultimately repent. The modern denial of the second has, I suppose, had more to do with the despiritualizing of theology than almost anything that could be named. Okay. He believed the Roman Catholic doctrine of purgatory. Does he say anything further\n\n(1:08:06) on it? Here he is advising a young student. He wrote, \"The idea of purggation, purgatory, burning your sins off on the other side, of cleansing as by fire, seems to me inseparable from what the Bible teaches us.\" So, is he teaching Jesuit doctrine or is he teaching Protestant doctrine? You tell me. He's teaching Jesuit doctrine, but it's\n\n(1:08:30) very clever to say he's a Protestant so that Protestants will accept his Bible because this Bible now comes from a Protestant's pen if you don't know. So teaches us that divine chastisement and little and though little is directly said respecting the future state, it seems to me incredible that the divine\n\n(1:08:52) chastisement should in this respect change their character when this visible life is ended. So he believes in purgatory. What does he say about the atonement that Jesus died for you? Well, here is his letter in life volume 1 page 322. I think I mentioned to you before Campbell's book on the atonement which\n\n(1:09:14) is invaluable as far as it goes but unluckily he knows nothing except Protestant theology. Okay. What does he say? Letter Hort to Wescott. I entirely agree correcting one word with what you there say on the atonement having for many years believed that the absolute union of the Christian or rather of man with Christ himself is\n\n(1:09:43) the spiritual truth of which the popular doctrine of substitution is an immoral and material counterfeit. Wow. So Jesus died for you is a immoral doctrine. Rather what is moral that we become one with him in Christ and become God. That's moral. Now who teaches that? The Jesuits and the Freemasons or the\n\n(1:10:10) Bible? Who teaches that? Well, what was this man? Belonged to a secret society, had a psychic club. And not only that, he hates the received text and he spits on the atonement. That's like a Templar. That's spitting on the cross. Certainly nothing can be more unscriptural than the modern limiting of\n\n(1:10:33) Christ's bearing our sins and sufferings to his death. But indeed, that is only one aspect of an almost universal heresy. Okay, these are the people who have trans who've created the document on which the modern Bibles are based. Do you believe they're trustworthy? I don't think so. Here's another letter. Hort to\n\n(1:10:58) Reverend Davies. No rational being doubts the need for a revised Bible. And the popular practical objections are worthless. Yet I have an increasing feeling in favor of delay. He was having problems because the British still knew their Bibles. Of course, no revision can be final and it would be absurd to wait for perfection.\n\n(1:11:19) But the criticism of both testament in text and interpretation alike appears to me to be just now in this chaotic state. In Germany, hardly as if all the less in England that the results of immediate revision would be peculiarly unsatisfactory. Oh, the British knew their Bibles. This was a problem. We\n\n(1:11:40) have to be careful and sneaky with what we are going to do. And he says, well, let's first read what it says down here. It is of course true that we can only know God through human forms, but then I think the whole Bible echoes the language of Genesis 1:27. And so assures us that human forms are divine forms. Gotcha. Mr.\n\n(1:12:06) Hort, what is he saying? He's saying we are God. We are God. Who teaches that? Satan teaches that. Now listen to this. 1 John 5:7 in the King James. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. What does that make Jesus? Makes him God. You will search in\n\n(1:12:43) vain in the modern Bibles for that verse. You won't find it in the NIV. You won't find it in the RSV. It's been removed so that they can be God. Hort to Wescott. I have been persuaded for many years that Mary worship and Jesus worship have very much in common in their causes and their results. Perhaps the whole question may\n\n(1:13:10) be said to be involved in the true idea of mediation which is almost universally corrupted in one or both of the opposite directions. Ah so who can mediate for you just as well? Mary can. Is that Catholic doctrine or biblical doctrine? What about the other man? Wescott writes, \"I've been trying to recall my impressions of\n\n(1:13:33) lassalletes.\" That's interesting. Lassallet. We'll be talking about Lassallet, a Marian shrine. I wish I could see what forgotten truth marit bears witness and how we can practically set forth the teachings of the miracles. Well, Mr. Wescott. So you want to bring Mary in and make Jesus less. Wescott to Reverend Benson. As far\n\n(1:13:59) as I could judge, the idea of lassallet was that of God revealing himself now and not in one form but in many to Reverend Roland. There are I fear still more serious differences between us on the subject of authority and especially the authority of the Bible. If this primary objection were removed and I\n\n(1:14:18) could feel our differences to be only a degree, I would still blah blah blah. So he wants to go away from this idea that the Bible is inspired and uh the error errors and prejudices which we agree in wishing to remove can surely be more wholesomely and also more effectively reached by individual efforts of an\n\n(1:14:42) indirect kind than by combined open assault. Though I think that convocation is not competent to initiate such a measure, yet I feel that as we three are together, it would be wrong not to make the best of it. As Lightfoot says, indeed there is a very fair prospect of good work if we three stick together. Though neither with this body\n\n(1:15:08) nor any other body likely to be formed now could a complete textual revision be possible. We can't change everything now. Let's do it bit by bit. We stick together. We three. There is some hope that alternative readings might find a place in the margin. So as we go from translation to translation, you'll find some in the\n\n(1:15:31) margin and then the next version, oops, they're gone. Acted away. And so the Bible changes. You know, if you pick up your Bibles and you turn to the middle of the book of Acts, if you take an NIV Bible and you go to the middle of the book of Acts, and then you page and look how many words there are to the end of\n\n(1:15:53) Revelation, that's how many words are gone out of the modern Bibles. From the middle of Acts to the end of Revelation. Now, if man is not to live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord, how you going to do that with so many words gone, up to 60,000 of them gone?\n\n(1:16:16) Ought we not to have a conference before the first meeting for revision? There are many points on which it is important that we should agree. The rules, though liberal, are vague, and the interpretation of them will depend upon decided action at first. It is quite impossible to judge the value of what\n\n(1:16:34) will appear to be trifling alterations. A one word changed in a text so that people don't even notice it. Trifling alterations merely by reading them one after another. Taken together, they have often important bearings which few would think of at first. Are you with me on this one? We'll change the\n\n(1:17:01) Bible a tad there and a tad there. And if we take it all together, well, we'll have an entirely different doctrines. And those stupid goyam won't even have noticed. That's what he's saying. Well, we're going to do that tomorrow. I'm going to show you trifling little changes and you will be shocked as to\n\n(1:17:25) what they did to Jesus Christ our Lord. You will hopefully be shocked. Remember trifling little changes. The difference between a picture say of Raphael and a feeble copy of it is made up of a number of trivial differences. Isn't that interesting? We have successfully resisted being warned off dangerous\n\n(1:17:50) ground where the needs of revision required that it should be shocked. It is one can hardly doubt the beginning of a new period in church history. So far the angry objections have reason for their astonishment. These people are subtle. Balfaur was a member of Hortz apostles and uh president of the the society for\n\n(1:18:13) psychic research. As I said, he was prime minister of England and he wrote the first draft for the League of Nations or he was responsible partly responsible at least in that. So these were highflying individuals. Let's look at this interesting extract from a book which Bible by David Fuller. Hort writes\n\n(1:18:36) to Reverend Roland Williams October 21 1858. Further, I agree with them. That's authors of essays in review in condemning many leading specific doctrines of the popular theology. Evangelicals seem to me perverted rather than untrue. There are, I fear, still more serious difference between us and the subject of authority, especially the\n\n(1:18:57) authority of the Bible. He doesn't believe in the authority of the Bible. He writes from France. After leaving the monastery, we shaped our course to the little oretry which we discovered on the summit of a neighboring hill. Fortunately, we found the door open and there was this pieta the size of life\n\n(1:19:15) virgin and the dead Christ. Had I been alone, I would have knelt there for hours. This is a Roman Catholic speaking. This is not a Protestant. If he wasn't a Jesuit, I'll eat my ass. Wescott writes to the Archbishop of Canterbury, an Old Testament criticism. No one now, I suppose, holds that the first three\n\n(1:19:35) chapters of Genesis give a literal history. I could never understand how anyone reading them with open eyes could think they did. They didn't believe anything. And these are the best manuscripts in the world. Do you believe it? I'm inclined to think that no such state as Eden ever existed. And that Adam's fall in no degree differed from\n\n(1:19:58) the fall of each of his descendants. There was no fall. This is occult teaching. Hort writes, \"The pure Romeish view seems to be nearer and more likely to lead to the truth than the evangelical.\" So Rome is right. The other one is wrong. Hort writes to Wescott, \"I remember shocking you and Lightfoot not so long ago by exposing a\n\n(1:20:23) belief that Protestantism is only paranthetical and temporary. We'll get rid of it yet. It's in the way. It's a no it's a nauseating interference at the moment. So we've seen now firstly when we look at the history of where these manuscripts come from that the manuscripts have three streams two of them are akin there are only two streams\n\n(1:20:49) based on very few manuscripts leading to these changes corrupted probably by Oregon and continued byius. Then these people pick up these texts and say these are the oldest manuscripts therefore they are the best and we will base the new translations on these manuscripts and throw aside the received text. Deuteronomy 11:16 says,\n\n(1:21:18) \"Take heed to yourself that your heart be not deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them.\" 1 Timothy 4:16 says, \"Take heed unto thyself unto the doctrine. Continue in them, for in doing this, thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.\" What if the texts are so changed that you cannot support\n\n(1:21:42) your doctrines anymore? What would you do then? Did you know that the doctrine of the dead, state of the dead, cannot be adequately supported from new manuscripts? Do you know that the divinity of Christ is a problem? Because a comma here and a little change there and something there changes the whole\n\n(1:22:03) picture. Do you know that Jesus turns out to be the liar and the other one turns out to be more truthful? If you read it in the new manuscripts, it's quite interesting. I invite you to come tomorrow and listen. 2 Corinthians 2:17 says, \"For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God, but as of\n\n(1:22:23) sincerity, but as of God, and in the sight of God speak we in Christ.\" If Jesus isn't everything and everything in our lives, then we have nothing. If Jesus isn't God, we have nothing to look forward to. The best we could hope for is a constant cycle of reincarnation into a miserable world. Now as a human, now as an animal,\n\n(1:22:51) perhaps as a leaf to be eaten by a cow. Quite a miserable existence as far as I'm concerned. But if Jesus Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and he has paid the price for my sins, I have a way out. I have a solution to the problem I am facing in the first place and I have an answer to all my inner\n\n(1:23:15) questions because I know where I come from. I come from a noble origin. I know why I am in the state that I am. I have fallen because of sin and I have need of redemption which I can find only in him who made me in the first place. And this is the doctrine that is under attack. Darvinism is supposed to rule in\n\n(1:23:39) the place of creation. As we've seen, this is what these people believe. The atonement is to be written away so that Jesus doesn't fulfill that role anymore. And a Zoroasta and Osiris must become his equal. In fact, I must become his equal because I am just as good as he is. I am also divine. So that they\n\n(1:24:03) claim either the one is true or the other. And then we have to answer ask another question. Why is Rome these days silent about the Bible but still rants and raves about the received text? Why is it attacked everywhere in every single college of theology? Why do they say in the colleges of theology the\n\n(1:24:30) very worst text in the world is the received text? Throw it aside. Here is something better for you. Come and see tomorrow how much better it is and see for yourselves. Thank you. [Music] [Music] Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] Home. Oh. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.

  "# Title:214_changing_the_word_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nAltered Bible Verses,Doctrinal Changes,Translation Comparisons,Textual Criticism,King James Version\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, \"Changing the Word,\" by Walter Veith, argues that modern Bible translations, such as the New American Standard Bible, NIV, and RSV, contain significant alterations to original texts, diminishing crucial theological doctrines. Veith asserts that these changes systematically undermine the deity of Jesus Christ, His unique role as Savior, and fundamental concepts like the physical resurrection, the atonement, and His second coming. He highlights how numerous verses have been removed or subtly reworded, often aligning modern versions with what he identifies as Jesuit or esoteric teachings that promote self-salvation and diminish God's direct intervention. The speaker contends that these revisions promote ecumenism and a rejection of divine judgment and the need for repentance, contrasting them with the King James Version, which he posits as a more faithful translation derived from the Textus Receptus.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 214 - Changing the Word _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-kzbZOgDSs\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] tonight's lecture is entitled changing the word and this is quite a serious topic and people get very excited about it verses affected in the Bibles a rough count would give us the New American Standard Bible 909 versus that's a lot the revised version 788 versus the new World translations\n\n(01:31) 767 the NIV 695 The Good News Bible 614 the Amplified 484 the Dua which is the Jesuit Bible has fewer changes Than The New American Standard in fact less than half amazing and the Reformation of course rejected this completely but they're quite happy to accept these ones very strange the old Jehovah's Witness\n\n(01:59) Bible only had 120 versus affected and when that came up there was a huge human and cry over the massive changes that they made and today nobody realizes that they're sitting with 909 verses affected which makes the 120 look like a kindergarten the new King James version ignored the texus receptus 1,200\n\n(02:28) times Jehovah's with this Bible is the first one that was changed Matthew 16:3 for example if we go from there onwards you'll see they removed that one irrespective of what that text means I'll show you later in the others that everything that was changed in the Jehovah's Witness Bible has also been\n\n(02:48) changed in the other Bibles or at least discredited in the margin if nothing else so they took uh Matthew 16:3 out when it came to the Book of Mark they took verse 46 out they had to cross it out when it came to Mark 16 vers 9 to 20 well they just took out the whole chapter because why because here Jesus\n\n(03:16) appears physically after the resurrection and that is a problem you see the esoteric World teaches that there is no physical Resurrection it is esoteric and a physic Jesus having raised been raised from the dead is a problem so take out the chapter and modify the chapters other than Mark that are not quite as blatant\n\n(03:40) on the issue so if you have one of the modern translations it will at least say in the margin that this is not found in the oldest manuscripts but as we saw the oldest manuscripts were already corrupt because they had the modifications of Oregon as we will see John 1 verse1 in the New World Translation that's the the the Bible of\n\n(04:05) the Jehovah's Witnesses as they have written it it says there in the beginning the word was and the Word was with God and the Word was a god whereas the King James says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so obviously Jesus was God in the King James but uh he was a lesser being if\n\n(04:31) you like with a lowercase G when it comes to the uh New World Translation then when it comes to John chapter 1 11 chapter 8 11 up to verse 11 the whole series just gone just take a pen ladies and gentlemen cross it out we know need it no longer we have found something better acts 8:37 in the Jehovah's Witness Bible is of course\n\n(04:57) removed because they Jesus is the only way to be saved away with that text you'll find it missing in the others as well 1 John 5:7 is a major problem because they're here Jesus is part of the godhood gone we'll come to that in the others as well so that's what Jehovah's Witnesses did they just took their pens and they crossed out all\n\n(05:23) these relevant verses and whole portions of chapters and whole chapters and there was a huge you and cry about it now imagine that the Bibles that we have today do more than that and nobody complains isn't that strange isn't that strange how we have changed Dublin review 1881 by the sole authority of textual\n\n(05:49) criticism not in other words by the word itself not what it says but by textual criticism these men have dared to to vote away some 40 verses of the inspired word this was early now as you see hundreds of verses are affected the Uno's baptismal profession of faith is gone and the angel of the pool of pesta\n\n(06:12) has vanished but the angel of the agony remains till the next revision the Heavenly Witnesses have departed and no marginal note Mourns their lost the last 12 verses of St Mark are detached from the rest of the Gospel as if ready for removal as soon as Dean Bergen dies remember I quoted a lot from Dean Bergen\n\n(06:32) yesterday when he goes they said well they're going to change a lot more and they surely have the account of the woman taken in adultery is placed in Brackets awaiting exision many other passengers have a mark set against them in the margin to show that like forest trees they are shortly destined for the\n\n(06:51) critic's acts who can tell when the destruction will cease that was in 1881 when they just started revising the Bible isn't that incredible well let's see what the modern people say this is what modern Bible Society say no testamentum GRE the German Bible Society stutgart what has that got to say it says when Abad NES in\n\n(07:19) 1898 presented the first edition of Noom testamentum grei he had achieved a work of which the consequences were not only unknown to him at the time but also to the Von book Bible society that made the addition possible if the texus receptus at that time still had a number of Defenders the science note that the science of the\n\n(07:44) 19th century had I ever finally proved it to be the worst text of the New Testament so the Bible The textas receptors that had stood the test of time until 1900 now suddenly was the worst text available ailable there the additions of torf that's the man who discovered that piece of rubbish in a waste paper basket on\n\n(08:08) which all the modern bibles are based since 1841 finalized edition of such and such and such and such and Westcott and H came in 1881 controlled the field but in Practical terms at the level of the University Church School the addition of the texus receptus was was still largely used internationally as for example by\n\n(08:33) the British Bible Society until 1904 irrespective of the changes the British didn't change that easily only with the release of the nesle text it did the rule of the Texas receptors come to an end here also much rejoicing in Roman Catholic circles that finally managed to destroy the texus receptus the encyclopedia britanica tells us\n\n(09:02) something about Oregon we'll see in a moment theed text the textus receptus is the old Byzantine text with hundreds of copies in agreement it was written in coin Greek not that written in coin Greek of which hundreds of words cannot be translated into classical Greek the early church used coin Greek manuscripts\n\n(09:25) and rejected the alexandrian versions which were B based on the corrupt versions which Oregon and other Gnostic revisions now the encyclopedia pranica tells us that Oregon taught that Jesus was a created being who did not have eternal existence as God so that's the basis if you want to have an ecumenical\n\n(09:50) Bible you have to remove Jesus Christ as the sole Savior and as God it has to be done well what does the Bible say about these secret initiations Isaiah 45:19 I have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth I said not unto the seed of Jacob seek ye me in vain I the Lord speak righteousness I declare\n\n(10:18) things that are right wow that sounds nice I like that Isaiah 48:16 Come Ye Ye near unto me hear ye this I have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there I am and now the Lord God and His Spirit has sent me no secrets with God Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he Reveals\n\n(10:43) His secret unto the servants the prophets Mark 4:22 let's go to the New Testament for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was anything kept secret but that it should come Brad Luke 8:17 for nothing is secret there shall not be made manifest neither anything hid that shall not be known and\n\n(11:08) come abroad Luke 11:33 no man when Heath lighted a candle put it in its secret place neither under a bushel but on a Candlestick that they which come in may see the light John 7 verse4 for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself to the\n\n(11:34) world which Doctrine do you prefer those of the enlightened enlightened initiated ones or those of the Bible which God would you prefer to serve the god of the initiated ones or the god of the Bible I like this one I like Jesus Christ let me tell you what Jesus said John 18 vers 20 Jesus answered him and him I spake openly to\n\n(12:05) the world I ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whether the Jews always Resort and in secret I have said nothing which God do you prefer I prefer this one I hate this secrecy this clandestine religion this I know more than you story isn't it disgusting I know the path and I don't care if you don't make it you're just a\n\n(12:40) cacumen well let's have a look how they changed it these initiated ones to keep the truth away from the rest of the world which verses did they change we know they change them let's just have a few easy ones and then we'll get deeper and deeper into to the doctrine remember a few things remember that H said we will change it\n\n(13:06) very slightly here a word there a word and nobody will even notice and finally when we have it all together when we have all the little changes in one big package if you read it all together our Doctrine and not theirs will be there isn't that what he said that's exactly what he said so NIV 2 Samuel 21:19 in another battle\n\n(13:33) with the Philistines at Gob elim son of yum the bethle Lite killed Goliath the gitite who had a spear with a shaft like a Weaver's Rod oops who killed him Ilan son of Yar orim King James and there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines where ananan the son of same one a bethlehemite SLE to the brother of\n\n(14:00) Goliath the gitite the staff of whose spear was like a Weaver's beam who did kill Goliath oh so you prefer the King James version over the other one over the NIV 2 Samuel 23:5 NIV is not my house right with God King James version although my house be not so with God so they turn everything around When God\n\n(14:25) says it's not right the NIV says it is right another one Hosea 11:12 and Judah is unruly against God even against the faithful Holy One King James but Judah yet ruleth with God and is faithful with the Saints you see God had said Ephraim has left me Israel has left me but Judah is still with me Satan doesn't like that\n\n(14:49) so he says no all of them were against me so he changed that too there's a little change it's you know it's minor but it it's quite important either with God or you're against God Matthew 5:44 but I say to you love your enemies and pray for those who P persecute you revise standard version King James\n\n(15:09) version but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you well let's just take that out and then uh we don't have a full story anymore Matthew 8 18: 11 don't you think this is an important text for the son of\n\n(15:34) man is come to save that which was lost don't you think that is an important text I think it's a very important text why why is it gone in the revised Standard Version because Jesus is not supposed to be the only savior so we're supposed to save ourselves didn't masonry teach that we can save ourselves we don't need Jesus\n\n(15:56) that's a ridiculous teaching it's just an example Matthew 2016 the revised Standard Version so the last will be first and the first will be last nice and the King James so the last shall be first and the first shall be last for many are called but few are chosen you see here it makes a difference here it is important to\n\n(16:24) choose to choose right here you just come first to last who cares but here you could be lost if you don't make the right choice which one do you think is the correct one so away with the choice business Matthew 20: 22 and 23 well the NIV says you don't know what you are asking Jesus said to them can\n\n(16:51) you drink the cup I'm going to drink we can they answered nice Jesus said to them you will indeed drink from my cup but sit at my right or left is not for me to Grant these places belong to Those whom they have been prepared for by my father what is the King James say Jesus answered and said you know not what you ask you are able\n\n(17:11) to drink are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with can you be baptized with the baptism that I am to be baptized with can you go through the same can you go through suffering for my sake Matthew 25:13 very important RSV watch therefore\n\n(17:37) for you know neither the day nor the hour now tell me is that a logical text for the god of the universe to put into the Bible to say watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour of what hello of what wherein the son of man cometh doesn't that make sense so which one is even the more logical one obviously this\n\n(18:04) one so now please note that in this one you know neither the day nor the hour of when the ice cream man will come along or whatever but in this one it's important wherein the son of man cometh now let's go a little bit further notice what the NIV does in Matthew 24:36 no one knows about that day that\n\n(18:30) we just read about or hour not even the angels in Heaven nor the son but only the father have you read that have you read that text nor the son what is the King James version say but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only where is the nor the sun bit it's not there now if you take the verse\n\n(19:00) where Jesus says I and the father are one then what does that make of this verse does Jesus then know when he's coming yes or no absolutely but what is it imply if you put there nor the sun it implies that Jesus is not part of the godhood are you with me it implies that Jesus is not part of the godhood this is a serious\n\n(19:27) change Mark 2:1 17 I came not to call the righteous but Sinners how nice hello Sinners here you come to me this is great the NIV I have not come to call the righteous but Sinners King James I have not come to call the righteous but Sinners to repentance wow here there's an action this is ecumenical let's all have a\n\n(19:57) party together it doesn't matter whether you believe the same thing whether you keep the Ten Commandments whatever you do if you believe that you can you know sleep around with 50 women at the same time who cares no no no the King James says to repentance so take it up we don't need that we are initiated ones we\n\n(20:17) are above that Mark 6: 11 if any place if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you when you leave shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them what's what does the King James say and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when you depart then shake off\n\n(20:39) the dust under your feet for a testimony against them verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that City why do you think that verse has been removed why do they remove the verse which says it will be more Toler able for Sodom and Gomorrah because they do not believe in\n\n(21:03) a judgment you see the choice that you make who cares didn't they believe in reincarnation whatever you did wrong now who cares you can fix it next time Round And even if you can't fix it next time round in purgatory you can burn it off that's fine so let's take the Judgment right up I'll solve the problem then we've\n\n(21:31) modified that text can you see how many pieces are missing so I'm not talking about whole verses here we're just looking at half verses and these things Mark 10: 211 revise standard version and come follow me NIV then come follow me ASV come follow me King James and come take up the cross and follow me what's the\n\n(21:57) difference between those two there is a cross to bear when you become a Christian there's a change in life and there is a cross to bear and that is Christianity the other is what salvation in sin one big happy party Mark 10: 211 why would they take that out isn't it incredible just take it out why not Mark\n\n(22:26) 10: 24 RSV children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God the NIV how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God wow even worse King James version children how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God what's the difference between those two well here you might as well give up from the\n\n(22:54) beginning and rather Inc reincarnate a couple of times here better not get rich better give all your money away here money is not the problem it's making an idol of money that's a problem isn't that correct you can be rich but you can do a lot of good for the Lord God you can do a lot of good so this one\n\n(23:18) is the only one that makes any sense this one is just discouragement my God is a god of encouragement not discouragement take it out with don't need that we need arms after all if you have to keep uh the monasteries and the nunneries going you better take that verse out Mark 13:14 but when you see the\n\n(23:40) desolated sacrilege set up where it ought not to be well this is fascinating but when you see the Abomination this is King James of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet standing where it ought not to be why take that out because Jesus is pointing to two specific apocalyptic books in the Bible where we should study for the end times\n\n(24:11) the one is the Book of Daniel and the other one is the Book of Revelation blessed are they that read the words of this book it says in terms of Revelation and it says when you see this spoken of by the Prophet Daniel go and look over there you'll find some answers there because they were asked what is the sign\n\n(24:29) of your coming and of the End of the Age check that out in the Book of Daniel Jesus said wow let's take away the evidence just remove it they don't like that prophecy Luke 2:14 revised Standard Version glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace amongst men with whom he is pleased King James glory to God in the\n\n(24:55) highest and on Earth peace Good Will towards men now what's the difference between those two it's a very subtle change but what is the change yeah there's an initiated few with whom he is pleased there God is for everyone not two classes this is for the initiated Insider this is for the cumans included cannot be\n\n(25:23) changed see what I mean it's disgusting it's really disgusting what they're doing here Luke 4:4 and it's not in harmony with the character of God that's the important principle so it's not a question of grammar it's a question of principle Luke 4:4 and Jesus answered him it is written man shall not live by bread alone\n\n(25:46) revised Standard Version NIV Jesus answered it is written man does not live by bread alone is that right King James version and Jesus him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God oops we're changing it all so we better remove that or else we rebuke ourselves right so let's just take it\n\n(26:13) out the word is not important today the word is just merely incidental what is important is what you feel what you feel is right God will lead you through his spirit all religions lead to the ultimate source trust your feelings forget about the word isn't that the teaching of the world today isn't that what they\n\n(26:36) teach but if you trust every word of God you better make sure that you know what God wants and make the necessary changes 2 Timothy 3:16 the ASV every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching King James version all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine they changed one little word\n\n(27:02) what's the difference one little word we will change said h a little bit here a little bit there and they won't even notice it they're after all catac cumans they're so stupid they won't notice what is this here only that scripture which is inspired by God is profitable so which is inspired and which is not well that's for the\n\n(27:26) initiator to decide isn't it that's why the pope will tell you what to believe and you can't just read for yourself because then you are heresis you make your own choice and that is heresy you're subject to the penalty of death all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine Luke 9: 55 and 56 just look\n\n(27:50) what disappears RSV but he turned and rebuked them and they went into another Village the NIV but Jesus turned rebuked them and they went into another Village you know besides being strange it's it's a stupid verse it's stupid but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit you are of for the son of man is\n\n(28:14) not come to destroy men's lives but to save them and they went into another village now which one to you makes more sense which one is important which one is more important to you this one has power this one has a savior this one has an answer to all your troubles this one has no answer whatsoever it might as well not be in\n\n(28:42) the Bible and I don't believe God ever put something so ridiculous as that in the Bible Luke 22:43 and 44 gone you won't find it in the RSV and there appear an angel to him from Heaven strengthening him and being in an Agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the\n\n(29:06) ground why do you think they removed that text remember they don't believe in the atonement and if they don't believe in the atonement they don't believe that Jesus shed one drop of blood for you away with that disgusting doctrine of the atonement as ha claims these are serious changes and the Lord says that people who touch his word like\n\n(29:34) this and remove Jesus Christ from the gospel they're going to have to pay the price John chapter 14 10:14 I am the Good Shepherd I know my own and my own know me King James version this is subtle I the Good Shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine there's a subtle difference there all right in view of the next\n\n(29:58) succeeding words as the father knoweth me even so know I the father this Change destroys the Exquisite diversity of expression of the original it makes grammatical sense and it gives the relationship between Father and Son which means that Jesus is God it's a subtle change to remove some of the power of Jesus\n\n(30:25) Christ acts 8 Acts 28: 29 let it be known to you then that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles they will listen and when he had said these words the Jews departed and had great reasoning amongst themselves says the King James now why does the book of Acts have to have that removed in the\n\n(30:53) RSV I'll tell you why because when you decide for or against the subject it's going to be divisive it's going to be divisive and they had great reasoning amongst themselves but a spirit of ecumenism says everybody come Together We Are One happy family here there is a spirit of Separation do you understand the\n\n(31:23) difference very important difference so Jesus makes a difference the gospel is a two-edged sword which strikes and cuts through to the marrow and people make a decision based on the facts and they either move to the one camp or the other Camp so that is why verse 29 in an ecumenical Bible had to go because great reasoning and a split came\n\n(31:55) between them one Corinth Ians 10:28 but if someone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then out of consideration for the man who informed you and for conscience sake Etc King James version but if any May s unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto Idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for conscience sake for the Earth\n\n(32:19) is the Lord's and the fullness thereof so why are there certain rules in the Bible because God owns it and who owns it here the Lord that's a reference to Jesus Christ so o we don't want him to own it because the esoterics remember masonry has someone else as their deity so where Jesus is depicted as Lord of this Earth\n\n(32:47) those verses are systematically eradicated from the Bible Revelation 14:5 and in their mouth no lie was found for they are spotless NIV no lie was found in their mouth they are blameless King James and in their mouth was found no gu for they are without fault Before the Throne of God you see here is a an\n\n(33:11) accountability towards a higher power here there is no accountability there could be an accountability to yourself it means nothing here it is important who rules revelation 22:4 14 is a radical change blessed are those who wash their robes I hope they use the right soap powder I don't know what brands you have\n\n(33:38) here but maybe it makes a difference Revelation 22:4 says blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the tree of life now which one you think he probably right here there's no accountability and uh what are you washing your robes with what are you rush washing your robes with blessed are they that do his\n\n(34:06) Commandments that's obedience let's change that in the RSV and the NIV and the ASV let's get rid of it Luke 4 verse 8 and Jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve while the DU which is basically the Jesuit Bible or\n\n(34:32) the product of the Jesuit Bible and Jesus answered said to him it is written Thou shalt adore the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve what's gone something's gone RSV same thing and Jesus answered it is written you shall Worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve the NIV Jesus answered\n\n(34:52) it is written Worship the Lord your God and serve him only all of them leave something out what do they leave out get you behind me Satan now why why they leave that out the expression get you behind me Satan was early omitted because Jesus used the same expression later to Peter in Matthew 16:23 to\n\n(35:12) rebuke the Apostle and we wouldn't want the same Spirit to be confused here and this has to do with the doctrine of Peter becoming eventually a pope it's quite a complex issue but uh there's a good reason why they took it out acts 13:42 Sabbath now notice this subtle little change this is very important for\n\n(35:37) those who keep the seventh day Sabbath King James and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath now remember that this is all based on Greek documents the words are there these are changes that were made by these individuals for\n\n(36:00) a purpose the JEA which was again this one based on the Jesuit Bible and as they as they went out they desired them that on the next Sabbath they would speak unto them these words the RSV does the same thing as they went out the people begged that these things might be told to them the next Sabbath the NIV\n\n(36:19) says as Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next Sabbath you see in the King James it says and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue what does that mean it means that he was preaching to the Jews and then the Gentiles came and\n\n(36:43) said will you preach this to us next Sabbath that means that the Gentiles were willing to come on the Sabbath now if you take the Jews out there then it's not Saturday necessarily if it's just day it could be an ecumenical meeting and Sabbath could then be any day but linking it to the Jews which day would it definitely\n\n(37:11) be Saturday it would definitely be Saturday so a subtle little change these guys are so thorough do you think this is a slip of the pen I don't think so now this one gets even worse very slight change but very succinct act 16:7 after they were come to missia they is say to go to Bia but the spirit suffered them\n\n(37:39) not the je and when they come to Mia da da da da and the spirit of Jesus suffered them not the RSV does the same thing the spirit of Jesus and the NIV does the same thing the spirit of Jesus now why you see you have to understand the occult mind to understand this one what happens here is the spirit\n\n(38:04) that's the spirit of God tells them no here it is now the spirit of Jesus which implies that the spirit is in control of Jesus are you with me the new age teaches that when Jesus was one of the initiated Masters that came to this Earth he didn't have power to do it right so he was overshadowed by mraa who\n\n(38:33) used him like a puppet that's what they teach here the same idea comes out Jesus is controlled by the spirit and the spirit tells them what to do here the implication is the spirit says no and if Jesus is the one who said no then he and the spirit are one one Corinthians Ians 5:7 Purge out therefore the old lein\n\n(39:02) that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us the DU for Christ Our Pas is sacrificed the RSV for Christ Our Pas our lamb has been sacrificed the NIV for Christ Our Passover Lamb has been sacrificed big deal what's gone for us you see the exclusivity of\n\n(39:34) Jesus has to go sad State of Affairs the phrase through his blood is not found in either the Jesuit or American res revised version its Omission can be traced to Oregon 200 ad who expressly denies that either the body or soul of Our Lord was offered as the price of our Redemption now we must understand something here\n\n(39:56) The occultist teach that Jesus never really died for you the occultists teach that Jesus had a esoteric body he didn't come in the flesh now the Bible teaches that he who says that Jesus didn't come in the flesh is Antichrist the occultists teach that when he hung on the cross he just appeared to hang there for the Jews and\n\n(40:22) that God whisked him away before he died so he never died a vicarious death for you you understand the difference so here we have the same idea he was not sacrificed for us because esoterically he never died for you because you don't need a savior you save yourself you are God this is arrogance of the highest\n\n(40:45) degree the power of God is denied 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently the RSV says having purified your souls by your obedience your obedience to the truth\n\n(41:09) for a sincere love of the brethren for one another blah blah blah NIV now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers love one another deeply from the heart you see here the obedience is something that you have achieved through purification of\n\n(41:27) yourself here The Obedience that you have achieved has been made possible through the indwelling power of whom of God through the spirit which one would you prefer to be correct here never mind what you prefer what do they change here it is not God it is not Christ in you that is working a change it is your own\n\n(41:53) power this is occult and that is biblical 2 Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at he appearing now this is a very important little change wow one little word by at one tiny little oh what difference does it make it makes the world of\n\n(42:23) difference at his appearing in his kingdom I charge you before God in Jesus Christ says that you a who shall judge the living and the dead by his coming and his kingdom RSV says the Same by NIV says in view of hello what does that imply this implies that the Judgment takes place when when Jesus comes back\n\n(42:48) Jesus is going to come back what does the other one imply implies something totally different let's see the King James in this text fixes the great day of judgment as occurring at the time of his appearing and his kingdom the Jesuit and the revised versions and the NIV and the all of the others place it in the\n\n(43:08) indefinite future anywhere it could happen at any time in fact Roman Catholicism teaches a millennialism there is no Millennium the church Reigns as the kingdom important point which is also not biblical of course so these things have to be changed to bring it in line with Roman Catholic thinking Hebrews 7:21 King James for those\n\n(43:31) priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that says unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of meis sedc okay so Jesus was a priest of a different order of a higher order because only Levites were allowed to be priests but Jesus was from the tribe of\n\n(43:56) Judah and as a someone from the pride of tribe of Judah how could he be a priest but he was of a higher order of the order of meis sedc who was king of Salem now what's the ji do thou art priest forever where's the rest what does the RSV do thou art priest forever what does the NIV do you are a priest forever\n\n(44:28) after the order of mchis EDC is gone so Jesus hasn't got a higher priesthood isn't that interesting did you know that the Freemasons when they are initiated are of the order of meis cedc did you know that a Mormon is in when he is initiated into the higher degrees is of the order of mcedc so he stands higher than Jesus\n\n(44:51) that's fascinating okay so let's make Jesus a little bit less than what he should be John 5:39 search the scriptures for in in them you have eternal life you search the scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life the NIV you diligently study the scriptures because you think that by\n\n(45:13) them you possess eternal life what's the difference between them here it is a command search the scriptures semicolon for in them you think you have eternal life here it is they who are have the initia on this point the Dublin review notice this this is a Catholic newspaper or a Catholic article July 1881 says the following but\n\n(45:39) perhaps the most surprising change of all is John 539 that's the one we just read it is no longer search the scriptures but ye search and thus protestantism has lost the very cause of its being so they knew what they were doing and why they changed it because we believe that you have to search the scriptures\n\n(46:05) to find eternal life and here protestantism is scrapped because just they believed a deadly blow against Miracles John 2:11 this beginning of miracles did Jesus in Kaa of Galilee RSV signs NIV miraculous signs not Miracles anymore Jesus what Jesus did was a miracle it's something that no one else could do Jesus was special he\n\n(46:37) was different to anyone he was not a magician the word miracle is found singular and plural 32 times in the authorized version of the New Testament alas what desolation has been wrought by the revised in 23 of these instances the word miracle has entirely disappeared in the case of the other nine although the\n\n(46:57) term is used in the text its force is robbed by a weakening substitute in the margin our authorized Bible Vindicated by Professor Wilkinson doctrine of conversion notice how this is undermined in Matthew 182 and 3 and Jesus said except you be converted and become as little children and he said unless you turn and become\n\n(47:20) like little children turn to what NIV unless you change and become like little children change how conversion is a very strong term and implies exactly what it means remove it let's go a little deeper human knowledge exalted above the Divine word of the by the revision without him says John 13 and four was not anything made that was\n\n(47:46) made in him was life the RSV puts in the margin without him was not anything made that which has been made was life in him now these are subtle little changes now let's just check out how it goes further no creation Evolution instead Hebrews 11:3 King James through faith we understand that the worlds were framed\n\n(48:11) by the word of God the RSV says in the margin by faith we understand that the ages have been framed by the word of God now it's ages okay the NIV does this by faith we understand that the Universe was formed at God's command now you will say you know I really don't get it it doesn't look like such a big deal here it's the\n\n(48:36) worlds there it's the universe you know what's the big deal well let's go and find out what Professor Hort had in mind when he suggested this change let's ask him it's nice to go to the horse's mouth well Professor Hort on wescot what did you say Wescott writes in this connection we see the full meaning of\n\n(48:56) the word used of Creation in Hebrews 11:3 by faith we understand that the worlds the ages the universe there's the NIV word under the aspect of time have been formed by the word of God the whole sequence of life and time which we call the world has been fitted together by God his one creative word included harmonious unfolding on one\n\n(49:25) plan of the last issues of all that was made that which is in relation to him one act at once is in relation to us oh they write so nauseatingly but let me continue Evolution apprehended in orderly succession see what did he believe in he believed in evolution and if you believe in evolution and then you\n\n(49:47) have to change the word just so subtly so you don't get the import of the first Version Colossians 1:5 and 16 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created that's pretty clear no doubt right Jesus did it RSV he is the image of the invisible God\n\n(50:11) the firstborn of creation for in him all things were created well if we're all Divine could be in us too right the new language of the revised and the Judgment of the revisers hinders the application of these texts to a material creation as in the King James and limits them as a spiritual application to Christianity\n\n(50:33) so there we go let's just change the whole doctrine of creation King James Hebrews 1:2 by him also he made the worlds RSV through him also he made the ages NIV through whom he made the universe now it's possible to spiritualize Creation subtle subtle changes Ephesians 3:9 really irritates me the NIV says and to make plain to\n\n(51:06) everyone the administration of his this mystery which for ages past was kept hidden in God who created all things what do you think the King James says let's read it who created All Things by Jesus Christ a way with Jesus Christ don't you think there's a subtle attack on Jesus Christ here or maybe not such a subtle\n\n(51:33) attack right maybe it's a pretty blatant attack on Jesus Christ but the spirits suffered them not we've had that already the spirit of Jesus and the margin the Dua is like the revised on this change Milligan says act 16:7 the Striking reading of the spirit of Jesus not simply as in the authorized version the spirit implies the Holy\n\n(51:57) Spirit had so taken possession of the person of the exalted Jesus that he could be spoken of as the spirit of Jesus so this is the exposition this is what the experts say so that's exactly the change that they wanted now remember that H denied the atonement they hated the doctrine that Jesus Christ died for\n\n(52:17) you by the shedding of his blood Colossians 1:14 King James in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins the Jesuit version in whom we have Redemption the remission of sins what's gone through his blood well what's the RSV say in him we have Redemption the Forgiveness of sins strange and the NIV\n\n(52:47) in whom we have Redemption the Forgiveness of sins that's the Jesuit Bible so basically if you read the NIV you're reading the Jesuit Bible through his blood gone change in the doctrine for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us we've had this text but I just want to show it to you again there it is the for us is removed in the\n\n(53:12) RSV and it's removed in the NIV so no difference one writer thus registers his indignation upon the change Made In this passage he writes here's Reverend Burks and Dr the warfield's collection of opinions mad yes I'm mad he says yes and haven't I reason to be mad when I find that grand old passage for even Christ\n\n(53:36) Our Passover is sacrificed for us a passage which sounds the keynote of the whole doctrine of redemption unnecessarily changed into for our Passover also has been sacrificed even Christ and we have such changes everywhere they are I believe called improvements in Style by their authors and certainly by no one else I like his\n\n(54:00) style this guy's got G so yes I agree with you 100% what about the SE doctrine of the second coming of Christ wouldn't it be interesting if they could change that as well Matthew 24:3 King James what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world RSV in the margin what shall be the sign of thy presence and of the\n\n(54:26) consumation of the age okay so Jesus doesn't have to come with the clouds he can just sort of know sneak around appear here appear there if you hear he's here if you hear he's there don't go you know the story let's go on Philippians 3 2021 King James who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto\n\n(54:50) his glorious body the RSV and the ASV say who shall fashion a new the body of our humiliation that it may be conformed to the body of his glory now what's the difference between those two why do they go to so much trouble to make those changes well let's ask them the change in US indicated by the King\n\n(55:12) James according to this and other scriptures is a change that occurs only at the second coming of Christ it is a physical change of tangible reality but the change called for by the revised may occur at any time before his coming or be continuous as you are changing as you become more accustomed to Christianity it may be a\n\n(55:32) change from the abstract vices to abstract virtues see they've spiritualized the way the coming of Christ he comes in glory and you are changed instantly that's what the Bible teaches they don't like that they prefer reincarnation 2 Thessalonians 2:2 here's an interesting one that you be not soon shaken in mind as that day of Christ is\n\n(55:55) at hand that at hand means soon to come revised now present aha this implies that it could actually be right there now has already come says the NIV so here again subtle changes changing the story of the second coming Titus 2:13 King James looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus\n\n(56:26) Christ awaiting RSV awaiting our blessed hope the appearing of the glory of our great God and the Savior Jesus Christ you notice the subtle change by changing the adjective glorious to the name noun Glory the revisers have removed the second coming of Christ from the text now it's not he that comes it is\n\n(56:51) something that could happen at any time Revelation 1:7 he cometh with the clouds and all kindreds of the Earth shall whail because of him notice this change King James version because of him the revised he is coming with the clouds and all the tribes of Earth shall mourn over him now what does it mean\n\n(57:16) remember that H said we'll change it here a little bit we'll change it there a little bit Bishop wescot himself States all the tribes of the Earth shall mourn over him in penitential sorrow and not as the authorized version shall whail because of him in the present expectation of terrible Vengeance aha so now when Jesus comes\n\n(57:38) according to this one they will all say we're sorry for what we did and he'll say find my children come you are all saved whereas in the previous one there was a judgment at the flood and there will be a judgment at the end isn't that what the Bible teaches yes or no ah it's gone it's spiritualized away you have\n\n(58:02) another chance you know again burn it off on the other side or reincarnate again or whatever Dr Alexander Roberts a member of the English New Testament committee is of course for the change what does he say acts 3:19 and 20 an impossible translation here occurs in the authorized version which implies that\n\n(58:21) Jesus will come to judge the world no we don't want that he says repent ye therefore and then he reads it again and he says for eschatological reasons it is most important that true rendering of this passage should be presented it is thus given in the revised version so we've changed it so that there is no\n\n(58:40) judgment when Jesus comes nice thank you most of the revisers did not believe there would be a personal return of Jesus before the restitution of all things which the authorized rendering of this passage teaches so there's a whole change of Doctrine here this is very important if you believe in the Advent\n\n(58:58) of Christ and what's going to happen mark 7: 19 because it entereth not in the hearts but into the belly notice this change this is so vile this change so sneaky because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out in the draft that means when you go to the toilet purging all Meats Foods so\n\n(59:22) basically the King James says it doesn't go into the heart it goes into the St and it goes out and then it's gone RSV says since it enters not in his heart but his stomach and so passes on thus he declared all foods clean hello where does he declare Foods clean in this one nowhere now let's read what the\n\n(59:47) NIV says it gets even more blatant boy this is some change for it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach and then out of his body in saying this Jesus declared all foods clean where does it say that doesn't say it anywhere so we got a whole new doctrine here okay interesting so for those who really love\n\n(1:00:09) the NIV you'll have a hard time proving some interesting facts Luke 23:44 and 45 King James and it was about the 6th hour and there was Darkness over all the Earth until the 9th hour and the sun was darkened so that was a miracle showing that Jesus was the son Son of God and here was a Celestial Miracle RSV says the Sun's\n\n(1:00:30) light failed and the Moet translation says owing to an eclipse of the sun I wonder where they get that from so no Miracle over here 1 Corinthians 7:5 leaves out that you have to fast sometimes or that fasting might be beneficial John 9:4 one little word changed notice this how cute they are I I must work the works of him that sent\n\n(1:00:58) me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work the RSV and the NIV says we must work the works of him who sent me what's the difference between the two it's a massive difference in the one Jesus is the only one who can do this work here we can all do it I will show you modern day preachers in lectures to\n\n(1:01:23) come that stand up on the pulpit and say they could have saved you just like Jesus could I'll show you preachers high ranking preachers in the world who say that exact thing and well no problem you can use this text in the new reversions to do that one little change here 2 Timothy 4:1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus\n\n(1:01:52) Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing very important again and by his appearing that same change where the doctrine of the coming of Christ is changed 1 Corinthians 11:9 now here you have the whole question of transubstantiation the whole Mass Story coming out for he that eateth and\n\n(1:02:16) drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body RSV for anyone who eats and drinks without Discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself the Unworthy is gone and the Lord is gone the NIV for anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the\n\n(1:02:38) Lord eats and drinks judgment upon himself wow this this is Roman Catholicism this is a host here you have transubstantiation the omission of unworthy and Lord therefore condemns Protestants who do not believe that the bread has been turned into the the body of Christ This is a Jesuit Bible the NIV is a Jesuit Bible make no doubt I used\n\n(1:03:03) to read it and I still have it on my shelf but I like to use it to show people the changes so don't throw them away keep them make a whole series of them now what about the restoring the confessional Roman Catholicism teaches the confessional King James says confess your faults one to another the RSV\n\n(1:03:27) therefore confess your sins one to another the NIV therefore confess your sins to each other the Dublin review this is the Catholic newspaper July 1881 says the apostles have Now power to forgive sins and not simply to remit them confess your sins is the new reading of James 516 so was it deliberate yes or\n\n(1:03:53) no it was deliberate it was very deliberate so they can get the confessional into the NIV Hebrews 10:21 King James and having a high priest over the house of God and high priest RSV a great priest NIV a great priest okay that means it implies that there can be other priests if there is a great priest it implies there can be\n\n(1:04:23) priests that are not so great also so officiating but and priest is one priest so now you can have a priesthood very important and this is a bomber I want you all to take note of this text everyone sitting here this text is very important for you and it's incredibly important for me the whole church government is\n\n(1:04:47) changed in Acts 15 verse 23 the King James and they wrote Letters by them of after this manner the apostles and elders and Brethren sent greetings unto the Brethren okay who sends these greetings and this information the apostles the elders and the Brethren send out the First Apostolic letter to the churches\n\n(1:05:20) the RSV with the following letter the Brethren both the apostles and elders to the Brethren who of the Gentiles the NIV with them they sent following letter the apostles and Elders comma your brothers to the Gentile Believers what does this do this is very important all they've changed is basically a comma that's all\n\n(1:05:44) they've done it's a very subtle change but it's a mighty mighty mighty mighty change and I'll tell you why because here you have three groups officiating in the church you have the apostles you have the elders and you have the Brethren and Peter says you are all priests does Peter say that yes or no\n\n(1:06:04) you are all priests that's what Peter says here you have two groups you have the apostles and the elders and then you have the Brethren now what did they think about this here we go this passage is used as a foundation on which to base an argument for a clergy separated by God in their function from the lay\n\n(1:06:28) Brethren it makes a vast difference in sending out this authorative letter from the first counil of the Christian Church whether it issued from the apostles and Elders only or whether it issued from the apostles elders and the Brethren here again to affect this change the revisers omitted two Greek words so they changed it by leaving out\n\n(1:06:52) two Greek words and now they have the apostles and the elders and then they have the Brethren have you heard people say you should not be preaching this you're not a theologian have you heard that what right have you to stand and preach the word of God you are not a theologian I'll tell you I have heard that many\n\n(1:07:11) many times in my life I'm not a theologian no I'm a Brethren and so are all of you Brethren and you have the right to preach the word of God because you are priests of the most high to change it in you have no right to preach you are not a theologian is Jesuit teaching it's from the pits of hell it's not\n\n(1:07:33) biblical and everybody is a priest of God so ignore them when they say you're not a theologian you have the right to read the word of God just as they have the right to read the word of God very important changes and they irritate me this name then of priest and priesthood properly soall as St Augustine said here we go back to the\n\n(1:07:56) church fathers which is an order distinct from the Ley and vulgar people orain to offer Christ in an unbloody manner in the sacrifice to his Heavenly Father for us to preach and Minister the sacraments and to be the pastors of the people they wholly suppress in their translations you see the point Augustine\n\n(1:08:18) says we Are Holy priesthood and you are just profane rubbish we'll tell you what to believe no no no the Bible says no such thing and that early letter very important Hebrews 9: 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment that's pretty clear RSV and just as is it appointed for men\n\n(1:08:44) to die once and after this comes judgment NIV to die once and after this to face judgment now let's ask the these people what the change meant Canon Farah claims the change was deliberate and Canon Farah ought to know because he was a member of the Apostles Club remember that club that H belonged to that secret society for said in this\n\n(1:09:12) change there is a positive certainty that it does not mean the Judgment in the sense in which that word is popularly understood by abandoning the article which King James translators here incorrectly inserted the revisers help as they have done in so many other places silently to remove deceit errors\n\n(1:09:32) well you're an apostle up there but an apostle of another kind I believe at the death of each of us there follows a judgment as the sacred writer says the Judgment the final judgment may not be for centuries to come in the omission of that unauthorized little article from the authorized version by the revisers\n\n(1:09:52) no lies no less a Doctrine than that of the existence of an intermediate State ah so by leaving out the little article you've got Purgatory in your Bible you can prove Purgatory but you cannot prove it is once to die and then the Judgment Luke 172 to perform the mercy promised to our fathers revised and the NIV to show\n\n(1:10:20) Mercy to our fathers now this is interesting this is f fascinating now you can show Mercy to our fathers so I can pray for the dead can I now pray for the dead apparently yes the text was one which if rendered literally no one could read without being convinced that at least sus suspected that the fathers\n\n(1:10:40) already dead needed mercy and that the Lord God of Israel was prepared to perform it to them but where were those fathers not in heaven where Mercy is swallowed up in joy and assuredly not in Hell of the damn Where Mercy could not reach them must therefore have been in a place between both or neither the one\n\n(1:10:58) nor the other what in limbo or Purgatory why certainly in one or the other so now we have Purgatory in the Bible did you know that it was there if you have a modern translation you can prove Purgatory tremendous the bishop further claims that the revisers in making this change Vindicated the Jesuit New\n\n(1:11:19) Testament of 1582 and convicted the King James of perversion right Jesuit Bible 1 Peter 4:6 for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead RSV for this is why the gospel was preached even to the dead NIV gets even worse for this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now\n\n(1:11:50) dead now what does that mean well here the gospel El was it preached to those who are dead sure in the past the gospel was preached to those that are dead now here it is still being preached to the dead acts 24:15 and there shall be a resurrection of the dead but the RSV says there will be a resurrection for both the just and\n\n(1:12:16) the unjust H so when you are dead you are dead and then you arise according to the King James but not according to the others now you can be a ghost so let's see if we can find ghost theology job 19:26 the nasv says even after my flesh is flayed yet without my flesh I shall see God so how do you see God now as a\n\n(1:12:41) spook Casper the Friendly Ghost that's how you will see him what does the King James say and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God that's a big difference the one is a resurrection the other one is not job 265 dead things are formed under the waters and the inhabitants thereof\n\n(1:13:04) the revised they the shades margin they are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof woo this is fascinating This is complicated stuff in the first one over here dead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants there of so dead things are down there the revised now the deceased\n\n(1:13:26) tremble underneath the waters so there's something like hell or Purgatory or something the NIV gets more blatant the dead are in deep anguish those beneath the waters and all that live in them wow so now we have somebody burning down there in purgatory so the NIV again teaches a totally unbiblical Doctrine\n\n(1:13:51) King James the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of Temptation to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished look what the NIV says unrighteously for the day of judgment while continuing their punishment what do we got here you know these bibles are disgusting as far as I'm concerned they\n\n(1:14:14) are disgusting they are teaching a totally different Doctrine here the different regions of conscious dead as Roman Catholics teach supported by the revised King James and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book referring to the Beast now that is of the lamb slain from the foundations of\n\n(1:14:34) the world here the lamb was SL slain from the foundations of the world the RSV and all that dwell on Earth will worship it everyone whose names have not been written before the foundations of the world here it's the people whose names have been written before the foundations in The Book of Life of the\n\n(1:14:51) Lamb the King James in 1 Corinthians 15:3 4 says he rose again on the third day the Revis said he hath been raised on the third day what's the difference between the two the difference is in the one he has power within himself to rise from the dead and in the other one he gets raised because he's inferior to God that's the\n\n(1:15:18) difference 1 Corinthians 11:24 very interesting the mass if broke it and he said take eat this is my body which is broken the RSV and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me now we have a host we have a literal body so this is Catholic\n\n(1:15:39) doctrine that is not Christ is with us always not in person but by his Spirit the revises doctrine of the Incarnation the mass therefore makes unnecessary and destroys the truth that he shall come to the second time without sin unto salvation Hebrews 9 28 Cardinal wisman exalts that the revision movement Vindicated the\n\n(1:16:00) Catholic Bible look what he says when we consider the scorn cost by the reformers upon the Vulgate and their recurrence in consequence to the Greek as the only accurate standard we cannot but Rejoice at the silent triumph which truth has at length gained over the clamorous era for in fact the principal writers who have\n\n(1:16:19) Avenged the vgate and obtained for it its critical preeminence of Protestants wow I wonder whether they were Protestants I think they were Jesuits disguised as Protestants because that's what we saw in the previous lecture and we have similar statements here from the Reverend Thomas the brief examination\n\n(1:16:39) which I've been able to make of the revised version of the New Testament has convinced me that the committee have labored with great sincerity and diligence and that they have produced a translation much more correct than generally received amongst the Protestants so he says it is in line with the Catholic version\n\n(1:16:55) and confirms the correctness of our Bible here we go so all these changes have been made Catholic magazine claims the revised version is the death Nowell of protestantism protestantism is going to go the destruction of their Temple that China departed from the holy of holies so perhaps it is to be with the English\n\n(1:17:14) Bible the Temple of protestantism it's going to be destroyed it's going to go the reviers had a wonderful opportunity they might have made a few changes says the Protestant Journal but they blew it they destroyed it one question I have for you is Jesus a liar King James version John 7:8 go ye up into the feast I go not up yet unto\n\n(1:17:41) the Feast for my time is not yet full come RSV go to the feast yourselves I'm not going up to this Feast for my time is not yet fully come here Jesus says I'm not going but he went here Jesus says I'm not yet going and then he went so here he's telling the truth and there's a liar you choose whether you want Jesus to be a\n\n(1:18:04) liar or whether you don't want to him to be a liar the greatest damage of all is when you take away the deity of Christ Islam makes Christ the man I'm going to give a whole lecture on this so I'm not going to talk on this issue Matthew 6:22 God forbid Lord far be it from the Lord slight difference we won't go into the\n\n(1:18:28) details Titus 213 awaiting our blessed hope the RSV the appearance of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ the ASV looking for the Blessed hope and the appearance of the glory of the great God and Savior Jesus Christ and the King James says looking for the Blessed hope and the Glorious appearing of the great\n\n(1:18:51) God and our Savior Jesus Christ here Jesus is God here he has only the glory that God gives him so he is subordinate to God in the RSV and the ASV the Isaiah 7:14 listen to this change therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a young woman will shall conceive and bear a son and you shall\n\n(1:19:14) call his name Emmanuel please explain to me how a young woman conceiving a child can be a sign for anyone who could qual qualify everyone so it's not a sign at all it's pathetic but the King James version says therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name\n\n(1:19:39) Emmanuel now that's a sign that's strange that's something special Jewish Scholars amongst the RSV translators so they obviously wanted this change Rabbi Bal for Brickner writes the following I am delighted to know that at least least this great error of translation has been finally corrected and that at least some\n\n(1:19:59) elements of the Christian world no longer officially maintain that Isaiah 7:14 is a prediction that Jesus was to be born of the Virgin Mary okay so they've just removed his virgin birth RSV Your Divine Throne endures forever thy Throne oh God is forever the name of God is here reduced to the adjective Divine but when this text is\n\n(1:20:25) quoted in Hebrews 1:8 it is made to apply to the Sun so we better change it here in Psalms or else Jesus might be God you see because Hebrews 1:8 says but unto the son he says thy Throne oh God is forever and ever but of the son he says thy Throne oh God is forever and ever you see even the RSV is the same there as the King\n\n(1:20:51) James so where did they change it they Chang mened in the Psalms so that Jesus wouldn't have it applied to him now this gets pretty serious Proverbs 8 verse 22 RSV the Lord created me at the beginning of his work what is Jesus now he's a created being the NIV the Lord brought me forth as the first of his Works what\n\n(1:21:18) is he in the NIV he's a created being the Lord possessed me in the beginning he was part of God in the beginning so in the King James he's God here he is a created being Daniel 3:25 calls him son of the Gods son of Gods son of the Gods King James Son of God big difference now again Micah 5:2 RSV from\n\n(1:21:47) you shall come forth for me one who is to Bear ruler in in it whose origin is from old from ancient days whose going forth have been from old from Everlasting so here he has an origin he's created and there he has no Creator Matthew 1:25 he's no longer the firstborn son he's just you will have a son King James\n\n(1:22:14) is the firstborn son so she was a virgin but if they removed the Virgin bit they better remove it here too so they removed it in the RSV and it goes gets even even worse in the footnote they say that Joseph is the father of Jesus the King James Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is\n\n(1:22:35) called Christ see so here he is miraculously born there he has an Earthly father and if we go to the King James Joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him the je his father and mother were wondering at those things so what happens now Jesus no longer has a miraculous birth and uh\n\n(1:23:02) you'll find the same in the NIV the child's father and mother marveled at what was said Matthew 1351 have you understood all these things Jesus asked yes they replied RSV says the same thing yes the King James says yay Lord so they recognize him as God curious oh by the way that's been removed many many times hundreds of times in the NIV\n\n(1:23:31) everywhere where it says Jesus is Lord that's gone in the NIV this one's very interesting Matthew 19:16 And1 17 teacher what good deed must I do to have eternal life and he said to him why do you ask me about what is good one there is who is good good Master there's a difference what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal\n\n(1:23:56) life and he said unto him why callest thou me good you see the difference there is none good but one that is God now what's the difference here this is a fascinating text you see in the RSV goodness is not applied to the person in the King James he is calling Jesus good master and Jesus recognizes something in him and he says to him why\n\n(1:24:24) do you call me good Master for surely you know that there is one that is good and that is God so what is he saying you have recognized something what have you recognized you have recognized that I am God that's what he says to him so that's gone that's changed so that Jesus is not recognized by this young man as God\n\n(1:24:49) we're going to get deeper into this Matthew 27:35 every where just about everywhere in the new translations where the Bible says that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots everywhere with the Bible says that the modern translations\n\n(1:25:13) have removed it why do you think they have removed it in the modern translations I'll tell you why because it proves that Jesus is the Fulfillment of prophecy and so they've taken it away so that he does not fulfill prophecy everywhere Matthew 2:15 out of Egypt I have called my son out of Egypt did I\n\n(1:25:37) call my son Hosea is now not a fulfillment of Prophecy because those are the exact words used in Hosea applied in the New Testament they changed them so that Hosea is not a fulfillment of that prophecy anymore Mark 15:3 and he answered nothing it says and the chief priest accused him of many things the King James says but he\n\n(1:25:59) answered nothing why is that left away in the RSV in the NIV and the ASV I'll tell you why because it's a fulfillment of Prophecy it's a fulfillment of Prophecy take it away Jesus must not fulfill the prophecy he's no better than any one of us and the scripture was fulfilled which says that he was numbered with the transgressors RSV gone\n\n(1:26:20) Mark 15:28 1 John 4:3 and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh this is a central Doctrine is not of God it's the spirit of antichrist RSV and every Spirit which does not confess Jesus is not of God oops the NIV every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God well\n\n(1:26:49) if they leave it out then I must assume that the NIV and the RSV was written by the spirit of of antichrist right or not yes or no well what do you say must be because it's not there so they're denying it his post-resurrection appearance in the RSV the original one gone Matthew 6:13 King James and lead us\n\n(1:27:17) not in temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever amen God why they leave it out in the daa and the RSV and the NIV for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory gone because Jesus must no longer be exalted Luke 11:2 father Hallowed be your name this\n\n(1:27:38) is interesting Your Kingdom Come Etc he said to them when you pray say father Hallowed Be Your Name NIV King James and he said to them when you pray Our Father which art in heaven have HED be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven now why remove all those verses you see here in the RSV and the\n\n(1:28:05) NIV you can pray to whom you can have the pope as father you can have the pope but here you can't because Our Father Who Art in Heaven cannot be the pope so let's take those verses out Luke 112 28 and he said unto them when you pray the same story you'll see all those texts the RSV and the NIV they're all taken\n\n(1:28:33) out uh post-resurrection appearance omitted Luke 24:40 RSV missing King James and when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet so they took out Mark so they take it out in Luke as well what about his miraculous Ascension and he was carried up into heaven and they wor him Gone Gone while they blessed him he departed\n\n(1:28:58) from them and they returned to Jerusalem with great Joy says gone leave it up John 3:13 again no one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from Heaven the son of man which is in heaven what does that make Jesus it makes him God who is now in heaven just takeen out now notice this one John 6:33 for the bread of God is that which\n\n(1:29:24) comes down from heaven and the bread of God is he which comes down from heaven there it's bread and there it's a person big difference Jesus is systematically removed in the modern translations truly truly I say unto you he who believes has eternal life who believes what that frogs are Gods there are religions that believe that by the\n\n(1:29:52) way today a l alive and living in a well in Japan for example who believes what Mother Teresa says whatever you believe God is that you must accept that's good enough no no no the King James says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me has eternal life gone two little words they make a big big\n\n(1:30:14) difference John 16:16 RSV a little while and you will see me no more again a little while and you will see me I laugh about this text you know what this text means Jesus was playing hide and seek he was peeping behind a tree he was standing there behind the tree he says Now You See Me Now you don't now you see\n\n(1:30:36) me now you don't it's pathetic God wouldn't put a stupid text like that in the Bible the NIV well it's just as stupid in a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me well I'm going to stand behind a tree that's what I'm going to do the king says a little while and you\n\n(1:30:55) shall see me and again a little while and you shall you shall not see me or a little while you shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because I go to the father that makes sense which one do you think God spoke you tell me come on obviously this one this is pathetic this is absolutely\n\n(1:31:20) pathetic I get angry sometimes I must calm down John 16:23 if you ask anything of the father he will give it to you in my name whatever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you there's a huge difference between that text you just think about it here the whole character of God and his truth is\n\n(1:31:43) implied here anything goes acts 2:30 being therefore a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendant upon the throne here oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne why do you think the of his\n\n(1:32:06) flesh is out why do you think so because they deny the doctrine of the physical coming of God In the Flesh he who denies it is what Antichrist so again we have the spirit of antichrist in the RSV Acts 8 verse 36 and 37 well this is a sad one the whole atonement gone if thou believest with all thine heart thou\n\n(1:32:31) mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God the whole verse verse 37 take it out not Jesus saves you you save yourself that's how you get saved you save yourself acts 9:29 he talked and debated with the Greek and Jews but they tried to kill him interesting King James he\n\n(1:32:54) spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him you see what makes the difference Jesus makes the difference if you want an ecumenical Bible well here's argument and debate but here the debate is about Jesus Christ he makes the difference Acts\n\n(1:33:16) 22:16 and wash away your sins calling on his name NIV and wash your sins away calling on his name and wash Away The Sins calling on the name of the Lord just one of those where they've removed him the gospel concerning his son his son Jesus Christ Our Lord here it could be his son Lucifer here it is the son Jesus Christ\n\n(1:33:40) Our Lord big difference Romans 9:5 according to the flesh is the Christ God who is over all as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all here Jesus is higher than everyone else there H different we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of God says the RSV in Romans 14:10 but the King James says we\n\n(1:34:06) shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ that makes Christ God and not only that it exalts Jesus as the judge but here they have removed this privilege from Jesus and made it sort of General 1 Corinthians 15 47 the first man was from the earth the man of dust the second man is from Heaven the first man is of the earth\n\n(1:34:31) Earthly the second man is the Lord From Heaven big difference now 1 Timothy 316 God great indeed we confess is the mystery of our religion he was manifested in the flesh who was manifested in the flesh hello would you care to look at me I am manifested in the flesh can you see me I'm Flesh and Bones it's no big deal but\n\n(1:34:57) here and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh there's a difference you see how they systematically reduce Jesus and how they take him out of the gospels it's a shame it's a crying shame and this one is the bomber do you know how much debate there is in the world today about the Trinity\n\n(1:35:21) and they say trinity is not doctrine of the Bible it has to be removed and they're right you cannot prove it in the NIV and you cannot prove it in the RSV you can to prove the Trinity and they say it's Roman Catholic Doctrine no hang on a second Roman Catholic Doctrine is father mother child on the esoteric\n\n(1:35:44) Inner Circle for the goam it's Father Son and Holy Spirit but the esoteric doctrine of Roman Catholicism I'll prove this in a later lecture is father mother child but it is a copy of the Heavenly and here you can see it 1 John 5:7 for there are three that testify nothing said King James for there are three that\n\n(1:36:10) bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one that makes Jesus God and part of the triun godhead this text shows that there are three powers in heaven the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and all three are in the fullest sense God that's what the text says out away with\n\n(1:36:35) it in the modern translations God re resteth upon you and their part is evil spoken of by on your part he is glorified gone the glorification of Jesus removed from 1 Peter 4:14 Revelation 1 what do they remove I am the Alpha and the Omega the first and the last gone his eternal godhood removed Revelation 5:14 and the four\n\n(1:37:05) four beasts said amen and the 4 and20 Elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth forever and ever his eternal godhood he is eternal gone out of the RSV gone out of the NIV well Matthew 4 4:4 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God\n\n(1:37:32) how must you know what God said if they've confused it to such an extent and just based on simple logic which one do you think is the most probable correct text the one that's rendered in the King James or the one has rendered in the other versions which ones do you say what do you say it can only be the King James because the\n\n(1:37:51) others some of the verses are so pathetic that's the only word for them so pathetic it's a nice word rolls of the tongue that it make no sense whatsoever now here's an interesting story this is St Katherine's protectorate Mount Si now what was given at Mount Si what did God give to Moses at Mount Si he gave the law he gave the whole\n\n(1:38:18) Bible to him the Pent the first five books he received them Direct ly from God and he wrote them down in a book and it's called the law of Moses and this camel has nothing to do with it he's just there to look cute now here is Mount Si they say that the tablets of stone were heun from this very rock well that's just a traditional\n\n(1:38:41) delivery up we go to Mount Si here it is where God spoke if this is the right place we're not really sure but nevertheless where God spoke in great Majesty and gave the law on top there's a little Coptic church and uh it's tough climbing up there my feet were sore and uh let's go down to go and then we find something\n\n(1:39:05) else Elijah's Basin there's the sign Mount Si Elijah's Basin down there and tradition says this is where Elijah came when he ran away from Jezebel now think about this here at sin God sends out his words it's a great thought Elijah ran to this place and this is where he hid from Jezebel why did he run from Jezebel what had he done\n\n(1:39:38) that he should run from Jezebel I'll tell you what he'd done he'd had a confrontation with the priests of Baal a mighty confrontation between truth and error and after the confrontation God took him back all the way to SI that's where the word came from that's what made the confrontation possible now what stands on Mount Carmel\n\n(1:40:08) today a huge bahai Temple which preaches that all religions are the same there's no difference between the various religions so it seems as if in the last days a a new doctrine has come in no difference between religions but Elijah preached there is a difference and there is a judgment and he comes back to the\n\n(1:40:34) law here sin today no on Mount carmile there is a bahai temple which says all religions are exactly the same and something else from Sinai the word of God went into the worlds and from sin night today something else goes into the world there's a monastery it's St Katherine's Monastery that's where the cicus text\n\n(1:41:03) was found that is the text on which all the Corruptions which we've just read in the Bible or based so here from sin a new word is sent out into the world a corrupt word so Carmel is corrupted there is no difference God is not a God that says come out be separate make a difference between them and those that worship the Living God is\n\n(1:41:33) the one message sent into the world today and the other one is here is The ecumenical word for you we are all one we're sitting in one pot the devil hates Carmel the devil hates the law of God and he is counteracting it right here he has taken that which God used and made it his own he is sneaky wouldn't you\n\n(1:42:00) agree I think he's very sneaky 1 Kings 18:21 and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Bal then follow him and the people answered him not a word they would have preferred to worship both then we would have had peace and quiet today they want to do the same\n\n(1:42:23) thing they want to worship both now I would like to invite three people three volunteers one with an NIV one with a revised Standard Version if you have one with you and one with a King James just to come up to the front and we'll do a little experiment just a quick one just for fun let's do it this\n\n(1:42:45) is great now I don't know how quickly we're going to find these text but let's just look up a few will you look up Matthew chapter 17: 21 will you read it to me out of the King James how bit this kind of goth not out but by prayer and fasting this one goes not out but by prayer and fasting what does the NIV say\n\n(1:43:10) he replied because you have that's 20 no I want only verse 21 please okay why doesn't it say 21 here oh it doesn't say 21 what does what does the RSV say it doesn't say either oh the RSV doesn't say it either let's go to Matthew 18: 11 18:1 what does the King James say for the son of man is come to save that which was lost W that's a\n\n(1:43:38) potent verse how many sermons have been preached on that word what does the NIV say it it says verse 10 and verse 12 there is no verse 11 there there is no verse oh okay what is the RSV say same you can't find it in there oh that's rather sad what about Matthew 23:14 could you read that for me please woe unto you scribes and\n\n(1:44:05) Pharisees Hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretense make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation wow the clergy that is so EX exed now gets one knock what does yours say no 14 there's 13 and 15 oh the the surely you know they must be so exalted Jesus made a mistake with that verse\n\n(1:44:38) let's just take it out what does yours say nothing it doesn't have it either what about Mark 7:16 mark If any man have ears to hear Let Him hear verse 14 14 and 15 but no verse 16 no verse 16 no not either it's important to listen to the word of God now let's take that out what about Mark 9:44 Mark 944\n\n(1:45:10) 944 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched there's a verse 43 and a verse 45 but no verse 44 no verse 44 no I no verse 44 that's a interesting text we can deal with it in a later lecture what's about verse 46 verse what 9:46 for where their worm not and the fire is not it's left out both times right there's a verse 45\n\n(1:45:43) and a verse 47 but no verse 46 what about Mark 11:26 Mark 11:26 but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses well there's a verse 25 and a verse 27 but no verse 26 you know we could go on like this for a long long time none of those voice verses will be\n\n(1:46:17) there so let's go to some interesting verses that are there let's go to Acts 9: 5-6 acts 9 verse 5-6 and he said who art thou Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks acts 95 and 6 who are you Lord Saul asked I am Jesus whom you have persecuted he replied now\n\n(1:47:00) get up and go into the City and you will be told what you must do okay and in the RSP who are you Lord and he said who are you Lord and he said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting but rise and enter the city and you will be told what you are to do so what has been lift up the whole P part where there is\n\n(1:47:27) opposition and battling against two options so in an ecumenical Bible you don't want division you want Unity so all these division texts where you make a decision they're gone in the new ones go to Romans 8 verse1 Romans 8 verse1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who\n\n(1:47:58) walk not after the flesh but after the spirit therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus that's all where's the last bit not there oh so if you have Jesus you are saved no change necessary in your life what about the RSV there is there for now no condemnation for those who are in\n\n(1:48:25) Christ Jesus no change need needed who walk not after the flesh does that apply a change and a conversion yes or no absolutely gone because we want to have one big Unity what about these are all texts that we didn't even deal with in this lecture and we could carry on and on and on and on and on with them\n\n(1:48:50) what about 1 Timothy 3:16 let just look at that one there Timothy one Timothy first Timothy 1 Timothy 3 verse 16 3 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up in into\n\n(1:49:24) Glory what is it verse 316 yes 316 is that where it is it's not in here right here there it is oh there's a little bit of it there the pillar and foundation of the truth beyond all question the mystery of godliness is great he appeared in a body was Vindicated by the spirit was seen by Angels was preached among the Nations\n\n(1:50:01) was believed on in the world was taken up in glory and you have the same he was right he was yes it says great indeed we confess is the mystery of our religion he was manifested in the flesh Vindicated in the spirit seen by Angels preached among the Nations believed on in the world taken up in glory and if you take that home with you\n\n(1:50:29) tonight then that is the Crux of the matter the King James version says God was manifest In the Flesh Jesus Christ is God Jesus Christ is the only one who can save you Jesus Christ is the only one whereby you can be saved because he's the only one who made you and therefore he's the only one who can\n\n(1:50:57) redeem you he's the only one who can open the seals of the scroll no one else no created being No Angel only Jesus Christ and if you want to prove any of the doctrines of the Bible you better have a King James or any other Bible that existed before these early 19 1800s you can take the Russian Bible you can\n\n(1:51:26) take the Serbian Bible you can take the old Croatian Bible you can take the Luther 1912 Bible just don't take the 1984 you will find a tremendous change you can take any old Bible in the world except the duer of course and the vgate and you will find all the doctrines necessary for understanding salvation in Christ\n\n(1:51:56) Jesus but any new translation treat with suspicion in af in the Africans in my own country the old Africans Bible tremendous exactly the same as the King James the new like the NIV in Germany if you have an Elba felda Bible it's exactly like the NIV you can find none of the doctrines in it anymore you will\n\n(1:52:21) have to get a Luther 1912 or a schlak Bible in order to find the truth and we could go right around the world The Armenian Bible fantastic fantastic they're now writing a new Bible version in Croatia for the Serbian language forget it it is a corruption it's based on westcot and H's translations so I hope tonight you have\n\n(1:52:47) found that what you read really makes a difference now let me tell you I personally like the new King James Bible I like it but there are huge numbers of mistakes in it horrendous mistakes in it some that really destroy some pivotal doctrines but I quite enjoy it because I put it in because I use the King James\n\n(1:53:14) to verify it and I cross it out to where it's wrong and my whole Bible is crossed out and redone and whatever I find that fun it keeps my mind mind goinging and active and uh so if you want to use another translation just be aware of these issues and then verify your studies with one that you can trust and the texus\n\n(1:53:36) receptus has come down through the stream of time it has been the one that led the to to the Reformation it has been the one that people have stood and died for and it is the one that will make a difference at the end you believe me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh\n\n(1:55:54) [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] w [Music]",
  "# Title:215_revolutions_tyrants_wars_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSecret Societies,World Control,Jesuit Influence,Historical Revolutions,Political Manipulation\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"Revolutions, Tyrants & Wars,\" by Walter Veith, proposes a sweeping conspiracy theory asserting that the Jesuit order, operating through Freemasonry and other secret societies, has orchestrated global conflicts and revolutions to achieve \"Universal Dominion.\" Veith claims that events like the American, French, and Russian Revolutions, as well as both World Wars, were meticulously planned to dismantle existing powers (monarchies, the Orthodox Church) and establish a \"New World Order\" under the ultimate control of the Papacy, which he links to Luciferian worship. He highlights alleged Masonic symbols in government architecture and implicates numerous world leaders as Freemasons, suggesting they are unwitting or willing participants in this grand scheme. Veith concludes by stating that this long-standing plan will culminate in a final \"apostasy against God\" before the ultimate return of Jesus Christ.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 215 - Revolutions, Tyrants & Wars / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt-ubg9zlTU\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] I've titled this lecture revolutions tyrants and Wars it sounds like a terrible title but that's exactly what it's about here is an interesting uh quote from poery pism and jesuitism at what then do the Jesuits aim according to them they only seek the greater glory of God but if you examine the facts you\n\n(01:29) will find find that they aim at Universal Dominion alone you see Rome had lost Universal dominion and the Protestant Reformation had been a major problem in this issue a major problem they have rendered themselves indispensable to the pope who without them could not exist because Catholicism is identified with\n\n(01:52) them they have rended them indispens themselves indispensable to Governors and hold revolu i s in their hands and in this way either under one name or another it is they who rule the world you see the papacy has crowned itself ruler of the entire world the pope is the ruler of the entire world that's the\n\n(02:17) Holy Roman Empire spread over the entire planet well if we have a look at a century of revolutions starting from 1750 to 1850 we'll see the American Revolution in 1776 and we can ask the presidents that then ruled who do they think was respon were responsible for this revolution then there's the French Revolution\n\n(02:47) 1789 the Spanish Revolution 1823 the Polish Revolution 1831 the German and the Italian Revolution 1848 by 197 you had the Russian Revolution and then basically it was time for war 1914 to 198 which made the Russian Revolution by the way possible and World War II 1939 to 1945 that's a lot of conflict on this\n\n(03:17) planet how much blood did not flow on this planet as a consequence of these revolutions and why because one power wanted absolute control and the Bible says the dragon gave it its power so that everybody should be subject to that power and to none other well let's have a look at a brief chronology here in\n\n(03:45) 177 we're dealing with this time period of terrible terrible configration on this planet the Masonic Grand Lodge of England was founded 1721 the first Masonic Lodge was founded in France 1731 Benjamin Franklin was initiated as a Freemason 1738 the Roman Catholic Church condemns Freemason by 1758 Sir Francis dashwood\n\n(04:12) found the hellfire club Benjamin Franklin visits England to discuss the future of American colonies with dashwood 1768 foundation of the right of strict observance that's the 33 Dee level of Freemasonry by Baron fon based on the Templar tradition so it's an interesting point and then Frederick of Prussia Frederick the great I don't know\n\n(04:37) what was so great about him but nevertheless founded the order of the architects of Africa and uses the title Illuminati to describe his neom Masonic lodges so that's just a brief history as we're going along 1770 Benjamin Franklin was elected grandmas of the nin sister Lodge in in Paris 1771 Grand Orient masonry was\n\n(05:04) founded in France 1776 order of the perfect tibil ists or Illuminati was founded notice they call themselves perfect the American Revolution starts so by 1776 they had put everything in place 1778 Peter I first founded The Secret Circle 1785 Grand Masonic Congress allegedly plotted the French Revolution the Illuminati was banned in\n\n(05:32) Bavaria who went underground there 1789 French Revolution 1784 illuminist conspiracy to overthrow the hapsburg monarchs of the Holy Roman Empire so they monarchies must go the monarchies were often opposed to uh Jesuit Rule and they banned the Jesuits well it was payback time nobody bans the power of\n\n(05:57) the Roman Catholic Church in 1816 John Adams wrote to President Jefferson shall we not have a regular swarms of them here in as many disguises as only a king of the gypsies can assume dressed as painters Publishers writers and school Masters if ever there was a body of men who merited Eternal damnation on Earth and in hell it is\n\n(06:20) this Society of lolos they didn't mince words in those days e wow that's the new Jesuits there's the the quote everything I say has got a quote now many writers warned of this great conspiracy of the Jesuits Samuel Moss remember the founder or the inventor of the mors code wrote the author undertakes to show that a conspiracy\n\n(06:41) against the Liberties of this Republic the United States is now in full action under the direction of the Wy Prince met of Austria who knowing the impossibility of obliterating the Troublesome example of a great Free Nation by Force of Arms is attempting to accomplish his OB through an agency an army of\n\n(07:03) Jesuits the array of facts and arguments going to prove the existence of such a conspiracy will astonish any man who opens the book with the same incredulity as we did so those are the people that the presidents believed were behind all these conspiracies President Abraham Lincoln himself said the Protestants of\n\n(07:26) both the North and the South would surely unite to exterminate the priests and the Jesuits if they could learn how the priests the nuns the monks which daily land on our Shores under the pretext of preaching their religion on nothing else but emissaries of the pope of Napoleon 3 who was a high freem of\n\n(07:44) course and other despots of Europe to undermine our institutions alienate the hearts of our people from our Constitution and our laws destroy our schools and prepare a reign of Anarchy here as they have done in Ireland in Mexico and in Spain and wherever there are any people who want to be free that's quite a\n\n(08:06) statement 50 years in the Church of Rome the priest father cheni wrote he used to be a Catholic and then became a Protestant this war would never have been possible without the Sinister influence of the Jesuits we owe it to poery that we now see our land rened with the blood of our noblest Sons Abraham Lincoln 1865 16th president of\n\n(08:28) the United States Lincoln private letters they were burnt by his son Robert restated by Charles chiniki who was the personal Confidant of the president in a letter J dated 22 January 1870 massini wrote to Pike now Albert Pike is this High Mason who wrote this the manual if you like of Scottish Freemasonry he said the following we\n\n(08:55) must allow all of the federations to continue just as they they are it must appear as things are as they were in the beginning with their systems their Central authorities and diverse most of correspondance between High grades of the same right organized as they are at present but we must create a super right\n\n(09:15) which will remain unknown to which we will call those Masons of high degree whom we shall select with regard to our brothers in masonry these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy through this supreme right we will govern all Freemasonry which will become the one international center the more powerful because its\n\n(09:39) direction will be unknown now Albert Pike wrote a letter to manini and that was dated August 15 1871 in which he propagated that there should be a world order a one order where all nations are under the control of one Central organization and in order to achieve this they planned the first world war to overthrow\n\n(10:05) the power of the SARS in Russia protector of Orthodoxy and bring about an atheistic communistic state did that happen the second world war that's also written long before the event to originate between Great Britain and Germany to strengthen communism as ath as antithesis to the Joda Christian culture and bring about Zionist state in\n\n(10:30) Israel did it achieve this objective yes in fact after this war Israel in its present form was reinstated under the protection of Britain and then interestingly enough a third world war a middle eastern War involving involving Judaism and Islam and spreading internationally well here's another quote uh just in case people don't like\n\n(10:56) that quote Masini with Pike developed a plan for three world Wars so that eventually Every Nation would be willing to surrender its National sovereignty to a to a world government the first war was to end the sarus regime in Russia the second to allow the Soviet Union to control Europe the third world war was\n\n(11:12) to be in the Middle East between Muslim and Jews and would result in Armageddon interesting now how were they going to do it let's read what Albert Pike wrote about these wars and uh how they were going to be um Unleashed he wrote quote we shall unleash the nihilist and the atheist so the destroyer and the atheist and we\n\n(11:39) will provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in its horror will show clearly to the Nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery in the most bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the minority of revolutionaries will exterminate these destroyers of civilization and the\n\n(12:01) multitude disillusioned with Christianity will receive the pure light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer the destruction of Christianity and Atheism both conquered and exterminated at the same time wow what a clever plan so you rub the two systems which you create up\n\n(12:23) against the other you create atheism as an antithesis to the Judea Christian culture you have these two Clash until they rub each other up and then out of that you will get a new world order where you have a new religion Which is far more esoteric and actually honors Satan isn't that a rather clever plan\n\n(12:48) well it's very successful that is whyo Aba Ordo AB is the the verse if you like that uh Freemason reuses this is one of their documents remember that I photographed in a masonic lodge and viop is the father of jacobinism you will remember that we spoke about that in Revelation chap 11 and jacobinism was the power that\n\n(13:22) propagated the French Revolution and we did this in Revelation 11 where the bastile was stor form Med LIberty Leading the goddess of reason was enthroned instead of Christianity so Christianity was removed and another Reign began uh the monarchy was deposed and Louie and his wife lost their heads the beheading of Mari\n\n(13:53) anet and that put an end to that monarchy then robespier he headed the jacobine clubs and a reign of terror commenced which in its Bloodshed and its violence Rivals anything that we have seen to date the great philosopher if you like of the French Revolution was Voltaire now you can look it up in any\n\n(14:20) Encyclopedia Britannica they will tell you who voler was he was a Jesuit they will say of course he was was a renegade Jesuit that left the Roman Catholic Church to write against it no no no he was just playing the role perfectly because they were setting up an antithesis do you remember the promise that a Jesuit makes that I will\n\n(14:44) take either side and do it perfectly as long as in the end the mother Church wins the social contract man is Born Free and everywhere is in Chains one man thinks himself the master of others but remains more of a slave than they are that's true but what if you created the slavery in order to create the misery in\n\n(15:04) order to create the revolution isn't that possible so the philosophers come together and they write a new constitution for this planet called human rights the Declaration of Human Rights 1798 declaration human rights you have the allseeing eye of Lucifer you have the serpent with a tail in the mouth the\n\n(15:26) lifegiving serpent the eternal serp Serpent and you have this funny little jacobine hat over there on the end of the spear if you look at the whole thing over there and then you have this bundle of rods tied together which are called what do you remember what they were called fash fash bundle of rods tied together and on\n\n(15:50) top of the fash you have this funny little hat which was the jacobine hat and that's what it looked like there's a better representation of also known as the frian cap once worn in ancient Rome by emancipated slaves as a mark of their freedom and adopted in the revolution as the Red Cap of Liberty well that's what they tell you that's\n\n(16:14) for the goyam let me tell you what it really is there it is this is the god Mitra and there he is slaughtering the bull and he's using a dog a snake and a scorpion which has got part hold of the more delicate parts of this bull and he's destroying him with unclean animals this is a war against Christ now let's have a\n\n(16:38) look on the side what does his hat look like it's the frian hat so this is MIT trism and Catholicism is MIT trism MIT trism was the religion of Persia it was the religion of Rome and it is the religion of the Roman Catholic Church there are seven grades in Mitra ism the highest grade is called father and then you got a congregation\n\n(17:04) now who in the Catholic church has a congregation and is called father the priest right and he could be a member of various groups and so can Catholic priests they can be whatever they can be Jesuits they can be uh franciscans they can be Dominicans they can be members of various other orders as well so Cyrus\n\n(17:26) the Great was the first one to bring out the human rights Charter now the Mortal wound as we had discussed it in Revelation chap 11 just to refresh your memory 21 February 1798 pop pasas is dethroned by Napoleon his ring was torn from his finger and he died in Exile now think about this if Napoleon was a\n\n(17:48) Freemason then he was under control of whom of the Jesuit order so who sent the Napoleon to Rome to take the pope captive the Jesuit order why well I've thought about this a lot within the Roman Catholic Church there are numerous orders and there has not always existed Perfect Harmony in fact the Jesuit order slowly\n\n(18:21) slowly took control of all the orders the Knights of Malta for example who did not lightly give up their power seat but are now subject to the Jesuits the Dominicans were at loggerheads with the Jesuits for example the papacy took the Inquisition away from the Jesuits and gave it to the Dominicans which created\n\n(18:45) tremendous tension and in the French Revolution it was the Dominican order that was destroyed there not the Jesuits they controlled the issue so there were some issues within the Church itself that also had to be sorted out to get complete control of the situation it was even so that at the Council of Trent\n\n(19:10) many of Roman Catholic stood up and said the word and the word alone don't think that everything in the Catholic church has always been negative towards the word no and Martin Luther must have made an impact as well and so there were many that weren't in line so the church itself needed a purging then there was\n\n(19:30) another problem and this problem was this that the Reformation had fingered Rome as the Antichrist now if the Reformation fingers Rome as the Antichrist any move that seems to emanate from Rome will be looked at with what suspicion so why not destroy the papacy apparently and then resurrect it with and at the\n\n(20:01) same time Purge it of everything that is Contra and then resurrect it as a final power in complete control of these organizations does that make any sense that would be a neat trick and then anything that happened thereafter with a weak little papacy over there would be disregarded it cannot be from them it\n\n(20:23) must come from elsewhere that is how secret societies work they walk behind fronts behind fronts behind fronts so let's see what happened by 1804 uh pas watches Napoleon Crown himself Emperor Napoleon then takes the Vatican States so Rome is diminishing by 1848 Masini attacks Rome and Pope is exiled P states are gone so this power\n\n(20:53) is gone the Protestants literally relaxed basically dangerous thing to do bartier takes the pope captive Vice hop and his fellow Jesuits cut off the income to the Vatican by launching and leading the French Revolution by directing Napoleon's conquest of the Catholic Europe and by eventually having Napoleon throw Pope Pas the\n\n(21:21) 7th in jail at ainong until he agreed note as the price of his Rel to reestablish the Jesuit order it had been banned even in the Catholic Church imagine that so it had worked underground this Jesuit war or maybe it had been banned purposefully to make it seem as if there was a war you never know because these people are superb\n\n(21:45) Liars but this is history this is what happened this Jesuit war on the Vatican was terminated by the Congress of Vienna and by the secret 1822 Treaty of Verona there's the quote everything I say has got a quote I'm not making anything up after Pope Pas was released from Napoleon's prison He forly restored the\n\n(22:09) Jesuit order with a papal bull now that is the strongest worded statement that a pope can bring forth in 1814 and the pope added in this ball if any should again attempt to abolish it the Society of Jesus he would incur the indignation of almighty God and of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul so this could have been a ruse it could have\n\n(22:30) been a game what could have been real whatever the situation is we will never really know until the curtain is removed one day but religious freedom for all and uh revolutionaries take to the streets and do what they feel they have to do Joseph bonapar here he is 1768 1844 king of Spain and he was Grandmaster\n\n(22:58) Grand Orient in France so here you have all the Masonic connections this come from the Masonic book Masonic sources Napoleon himself a high Freemason is now Waging War in the whole of Europe cleaning up the monarchies and then he has a war with England now who controls England by this stage the Freemasons so we have a battle\n\n(23:26) of watero and these are the generals that fought on the two sides Michelle n and Ean kouchi they are on the side of Napoleon High Freemason High Freemason Napoleon High Freemason on the other side you have General BL those who are German will know a statement that goes R the catak which means you know general b\n\n(23:55) at the river katzbach he gave Napoleon Blazers hi Freemason and gnost hi Freemason they were all Freemasons so this war was it really a war or was it a planned War now who are the orchestrators of the first world war well there he is Kaiser vilam the first what has he got on this comes from a masonic book He's Got His Masonic apron\n\n(24:21) on he's a high Freemason that's what he was here is Kaiser Fred de there he is with his Freemason regalia from a Freemason book they're proud that these Kings were all Freemasons so the whole War situation is being planned by Freemasons who are being run by who by the Jesuits now let's have a look at America\n\n(24:44) quickly here is this Grand building the capital there is the foundation stone and it says laid masonically September 177 1932 okay so by that time America was ruled by Freemasonry of course the people are totally unaware the institutions continue as before but they are all being infiltrated if you look at the the uh architecture the\n\n(25:12) Eagles the symbolism what you have is Sun worship you have Mitra ISM displayed here the street plan of Washington is Masonic you have the upside down goat of Mendes in the street plan then you have have the compass and the set square and everything is in blocks of 13 and the Masonic temples are on the 13th Street\n\n(25:36) Etc the whole street plan of Washington is masonically laid so it's dedicated to Lucifer of course the people are unaware of this the White House is then built with this tremendous Stella over there the height of which is 555 ft not 666 that belongs to someone higher in Rome this is 555 and uh isn't it interesting that 555\n\n(26:06) is the number that Hollywood uses have you ever heard when they say What's the telephone number on any TV program or any one of those oh it's 555 blah blah blah blah blah have you heard of that it's dedicated to Hollywood by the way Hollywood Hollywood is the wood they use to make a Witcher staff so it's\n\n(26:23) dedicated to Lucifer it's witchcraft but that just besides the point so here is the Stella let's who laid these foundations the Freemasons so let's ask them what it means here is the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry you're going to get a better Source from that Obelisk were originally erected in honor of the\n\n(26:42) sun god the connection comes from the Egyptian worship of the fos so there stands a male whatever in the white house so we don't have to go it's dedicated to Osiris and to Isis and uh anyway that is the structure over there the military structure is a pentagon which is the high center of the pentagram into which for example 13\n\n(27:12) witches would step in order 12 around one in order to propagate a curse so this is also a witchcraft structure so it's just a building but it has certain connotations then France the one that has this new philosophy for a new world sends a gift to the United States the Statue of Liberty so let's ask UNESCO what it means UNESCO says the\n\n(27:40) seven Rays emanating from mitra's Halo there's the god Mitra uh symbolize the Triumph of the forces o over the forces of Darkness now you must understand that Lucifer says that Michael and his angels represent the forces of Darkness that yve is the devil isn't that terrible you remember that we did that and here UNESCO tells\n\n(28:08) us that the head of the Statue of Liberty is adorned with mitra's seven Rays the flame she holds is a sun symbol so this is the torch of Lucifer because it doesn't matter whether Lucifer is male or female he androgenic in uh his story here is the foundation stone at this site on August 5 1884 the Cornerstone of the pedestal of the\n\n(28:31) Statue of Liberty enlightening the world that's illumination was laid with ceremony by William so and so Grandmaster of Masons and there's the Masonic sign so the Statue of Liberty is Masonic everything will appear to be Masonic as we continue Tex Mars writes towering above the shimmering but polluted Waters she\n\n(28:56) holds in her outstretched arm and a hand the torch of fire and light a gift of the Masonic order the modern inheritors of the Illuminati Heritage of the Statue of Liberty was sculptured by Frederick Baldi a member of the Masonic Lodge of alake laoren in Paris France the statue is significant to the secret societies\n\n(29:17) plotting the New World Order there you go right by 1854 Pas declared the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary now Mary is being she's always been there in Roman Catholicism but now Mary is being placed into the very center and legitimized as the mother of God and as an entity in heaven in 1869 P summons the first\n\n(29:49) Vatican Council and in 1870 the dogma of papal infallibility is published now we have another God on Earth and ultramontanism triumphs the Jesuit see to it that all power is concentrated in one man what happens then by 1917 the Russian Revolution and you had this interesting Fatima message there a link with Islam there but never mind\n\n(30:19) we'll come to that in the next lecture Russia will be converted the Holy Father will consecrate Russia to me and then there was a vision of hell and the third Vision was that the present Pope would have a assassination attack which happened now it's not too difficult if you've planned all these things from the\n\n(30:39) beginning to say what will happen you see not too difficult now let's have a look at the parallels between the Jesuit French and the Russian revolutions they worked like this both revolutions were based on communist writings of Freemasons voler Marx the Jesuits perfect Ed communism on their reductions\n\n(30:59) in Paraguay so in Paraguay they tested whether this would work or not and perfected it there both revolutions plundered the state churches both revolutions ended the monarchies both the bbon and the rammana dynasties had expelled the Jesuits both of them were gone they weren't going to take this chance again both\n\n(31:21) revolutions produced republics in form but absolute monarchies in power controlled behind the scenes by the people that were now in control both Revol revolutions declared atheism as the religion of the state both revolutions carried out a reign of terror by an inquisitional secret police and boy was that some reign of terror\n\n(31:47) millions millions died Stalin is personally responsible for the death of millions of people both revolutions resulted in military dict responsible for the elimination of denters exactly the same pattern if it works once why not use it again the lesson learned on these platonic republics there in Paraguay\n\n(32:09) provided the groundwork for Marxist Communist Manifesto by which Every Nation on Earth would be reduced to gani reductions thereby destroying the white Protestant middle classes while restoring the communal feudalism of the papal Caesar's Dark Ages that's just the quote well it's a bit sharp but it more\n\n(32:31) or less sums it up so KL Marx by 1844 wrote the The Communist Manifesto that's when he wrote it that's when it was published 1848 by 1928 papal nanio in Germany leads the Catholic powerful Center party to the right and helps Skyrocket Adolf Hitler to power now who's Adolf Hitler by 1929 Pas disband the Catholic party\n\n(33:01) it's done its job and people are ready to vote and in the same year he crowns himself Sovereign ruler of the world what arrogance now the pope is Sovereign ruler of the world in the same year he signs the documents now a ruler has to have a country and he gets his papal State back the smallest state in the\n\n(33:23) world and the papacy now again qualifies as a political entity now it had been dead it was no longer a political entity so the Beast was mortally wounded and now it gets its power back and now it qualifies that's a beast again its wound was healed isn't that correct that's why the San Francisco Chronicle almost\n\n(33:46) quoting the Bible says that while they signed this document the wound was healed in this display now we're ready for war 1934 in Yugoslavia an organization called the usachi is formed what a disgusting organization founded and they assassinate King Alexander of Yugoslavia now the estasi is a military\n\n(34:13) organization with basically Nazi features and they slaughtered the serbs they slaughtered the Orthodox people and forced them to become Catholic or to die one of the two and nothing is ever said about this tremendous Slaughter that took place over here 1941 Croatia declares itself independent and the\n\n(34:39) slaughter begins this is the man who is now Pope Cardinal Secretary of State eugeno pateli there is his family all of the Masonic connection and of course they have the Banco di Romano at their disposal with rosch child money this man does he have Masonic features yes here he is at his election his cell number was 13 a very\n\n(35:07) important number in uh Freemasonry there he is in the Masonic triangle stamp that they produced there he is with the Masonic sign just as Anthony Se had it and something else from then on the pop pop papacy wore the ephod the little plaque that was also worn by the priests of Israel now let's ask Albert Macky a 33Â° Freemason to\n\n(35:37) quote to us what this means he says the grand high priest of the Royal Arch Freemasonry from 1859 1865 in the USA states in his standard work this ISM states that the high priest of the Royal Arch officially wears the EOD so who's the high priest of Freemasonry there he is the pope well pateli visited the United\n\n(36:10) States and conversed with this man president FD rousel now this is a lodge picture with which should never probably have been released and they're probably very upset that it has been released but it shows roselt in his full Masonic regalia and and there it shows him with his fases on his head and he's receiving\n\n(36:33) uh Masonic handshake note the Masonic handshake and uh interesting phase we will come to that in the next lecture what that all symbolizes why they are wearing phases and uh he appoints myON Taylor as special Envoy to the Vatican now let's have a look at the Freemason political leaders in the United States and I'm just quot\n\n(36:58) from various sources and web pages there will be different ones here so you can check it out for yourself to show you just who control at the moment we'll just run through them quickly and see what degrees they are Bill Clinton 33 degree new grid 33 degree Bob dull 33 degre Jack Kemp 33 degree storm Thurman\n\n(37:16) 33 degre Colin Powell 33 degre Jesse Helms 33 degre Barry Goldwater 33Â° Al goore probably 33Â° then another one over here another one James morron Andrew Johnson James Garfield McKinley rosfeld of course William Toof Franklin rosfeld Harding Lyndon Johnson Gerald Ford Ronald Reagan George bus all of them Yak Rabin yasa\n\n(37:40) Arafat Prince Philip Duke of Kent many others has another source Saddam Hussein that's interesting we'll have to come to him 33 degree Freemason Tony Blair 33 degree Gat sha prime minister of Germany if you like president 33 degree benjam n 33 yasa Arafat 33 degree Ronald Reagan gorbachov Helmut Cole Shimon Perez hel Cole is\n\n(38:07) also a

Freemason Albert Pike of course you know Bertrand Russell Otto hartsburg Vice hope all the way\n\n(39:36) back here is Ed G Hoover president Dwight D Eisenhower there honors him with the 33 Grand Cross at the special White House ceremony they're not ashamed of any of this here are just about all the presidents of the United States in the presidential gallery of the lodge I photographed this myself I went into to the lodge I went\n\n(39:58) into the presidential Gallery I photographed each one of these and then me not me anyway there they all are as Freemasons if we look at the American dollar some very interesting things happened under the time of roselt there is this symbol on the dollar there's that some we haven't got time for all of this in God we trust\n\n(40:25) one uh if you look at this symbol over here it says antus nov Orum if you intercalate the hexagram then you'll have this a s n o m which is a SC scrambling of Mason Mason if you go to the other side it points to objects and it then reads arto you have Arlington ah there's too much there to talk about and\n\n(40:51) many interesting things if you go to the one and you go to the half moon there's a little structure over there can you see it it's a micro dot you'll have to get a magnifying glass and look at it under a magnifying glass and you'll see it's a little owl a little owl owl in a half moon and this over here you'll see\n\n(41:11) is a spider's web there's a lot of symbolism over here now if you go to the ancient coins you will see that the deities were associated with the owl and you will see that when we went to the Bohemian Grove what did they worship there the great owl of bohemia and you saw the presidents of the United States\n\n(41:33) bow down to the owl of bohemia quite a scary business now looking at this symbol you have the allseeing eye of Lucifer it is not yet on the base of the triangle when it is placed on he will have his kingdom but that is Lewis Lucifer anus he God no Orum new order of the ages there are 13 levels over there the bottom one is the\n\n(42:02) date of the founding of the the independence of the United States but it is also the founding of the Illuminati you have the spiders web symbol of the new age you have uh over here the band The Ribbon of Lucifer you will see it over here in this Roman Catholic church where you have Anubis the phix symbol of Jupiter the god Jupiter and\n\n(42:31) the skull and crossbones and there you have the ribbon you see it associated with Jupiter that's on the flame and all of these symbols tell us one interesting story on the other side you have this symbol there are nine feathers there are 13 Spears there are 13 leaves there are 13 pentagrams shaped in the form of a\n\n(42:55) hexagram you have the eagle you have this statement over here puus Unum out of many one we're going to reunite All Nations so that's the symbolism of a new world order on the dollar the world is going to be United under one central government and that government is going to be in control of Lucifer not Jesus\n\n(43:21) Christ although Jesus Christ of course knows about it permits it and is ultimately in control he tells us ahead of time that this is going to happen and then the end of the story is that Jesus will reign on this planet Revelation 13:11 and I saw another Beast coming up out of the earth and it had two horns\n\n(43:41) like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon we're going to deal with this prophecy in detail in another lecture it exercises all the authority of the first Beast which we will find will be Roman Catholicism before it and causes the earth and the those that dwell in it to worship the first Beast whose deadly\n\n(44:00) wound was healed so here was now a Protestant Ally that would enforce papal doctrines but that's in another lecture complete lecture called two beasts become friends if we look at the architecture even it is interesting that is St Peter's that is the capital building the architecture is identical of course the building itself was\n\n(44:24) designed the American one by Freemasonry and Freemasonry is in control by whom the Jesuit order now let's have a look at some of the symbolism over there and some of the interesting issues we are now ready for the second world war and the three main role players of the Allies are this man over here Winston Churchill and he was a\n\n(44:50) what 33Â° Freemason we saw roselt in his full Masonic regard he was a 32 or 33 degree Freemason and then we have Stalin who was of course Grand Orient member so 33 degree Freemason they're all on one side extract from a report by Ambassador Harman in Moscow to the state department June 30 1944 Stalin paid tribute to the\n\n(45:21) assistance rendered by the United States to Soviet industry before and during the war he said that about 2/3 of all the large Industrial Enterprises in the Soviet Union had been built with United States help or technical assistance the other third had been Britain so who built the United uh the USSR who built\n\n(45:43) it the West the West financed it and built it here you can see Winston Churchill in his drw Masonic Lodge with all his drw fellows around them so these are genuine facts this isn't just conjecture what about the other side Hitler Hitler said I learned much from the order of the Jesuits until now there\n\n(46:09) has never been anything more grandio on Earth than the hierarchial system of the Catholic church I transferred much of this organization into my own party the SS was constituted according to the Jesuit principles himla head of the SS was closely associated with the Jesuits through his father and brother\n\n(46:28) Hitler said of him I can see himla as our Ignatius of Lala and Joseph Gobles was also a trained Jesuits so the two sides who controls them both the same parties this is called thesis antithesis Gobles himla these people were Jesuits they were fascists Adolf Hitler fascist using the symbolism of the sun god the maltes\n\n(47:03) cross the symbols of the Sun God here he is with uh Hindenburg himself of course a Freemason this thing is all entirely planned gaining the youth on his side one of the principal Catholic personalities to help Hitler to power was France Fon paren and France Fon paren of course leader of the Catholic\n\n(47:24) party helped to Skyrock Ro ET Hitler to power so the Catholic Church skyrocketed Hitler to power and these are posed pictures they have Masonic meaning but we'll get to that later the re adla chosen as the symbol Masonic symbol and uh the supposed happy Alliance in the beginning which then deteriorates here\n\n(47:49) you see the salute with the Masonic uh activities associated with it here he is together with the church leaders and here you can see the Cardinals giving the H Hitler salute so the church was very much involved with the Nazi movement there is a bunch of cardinals giving the H Hitler salute the pope and\n\n(48:15) the fura you will recall that even to this day there is tremendous anger about Pope pasas having now being declared on his way to sainthood because of his connection with the Nazi movement well here is the new re spish lud Mah the Protestant one who greets Adolf Hitler with a nice handshake the previous one the previous Protestant\n\n(48:42) Bishop no longer lived because ad of Hitler had him executed so this one must have been a puppet on the religious side so the Catholics and the Protestants next to each other now understand the war let's think about the war who is the problem in terms of the Roman Catholic Church firstly the Orthodox Church in\n\n(49:07) the East had been a problem the first world war sorted that out the SAR had been removed and the Orthodox church had been subjected as were all the churches to make it look right by atheistic communism but the leaders of communism were all Catholics in fact I have traveled in many of those countries and the people\n\n(49:34) the old people all told me now we understand why the leaders of the Communist regimes why they all attended the Catholic Church why if they were all atheists were they such good Catholics well this Mighty Army is built up but Germany is divided the north of Germany and particularly the east of Germany is all Protestant\n\n(50:03) they're lutherans and they are skeptical of the papacy whereas the south of Germany is all Catholic in the Orthodox countries like the entire USSR you have the Orthodox Church controlling the mindset of the people now since the Takeover of Communism that has been reduced or subjected and the Orthodox church has\n\n(50:34) been subject to the States now comes this Mighty wall the symbols being carried here are the symbols of Lucifer they're also used in theosophy there you can see them there's the swastika the all seeing Serpent and AD of Hitler himself was a tremendous occultist of course as a Insider he would be but of course his outer Garb of\n\n(51:00) religion was Catholicism you'll find the same swastika on the foot of Buddha and as I recall as I told you before it was a Jesuit priest father stemper not Hitler who really wrote mine C so a Jesuit wrote the book the SS has the same symbols as the Skull and Bones people the skull with a crossbone Min High\n\n(51:27) trya my honor means Troya to be loyal loyalty the SS had been organized by himla according to the principle of the Jesuit order and became basically the new if you like Inquisition and anybody who did not obey the system was destroyed now we read much in the literature about 6 million Jews who were destroyed but we read\n\n(51:57) nothing about 2 and a half million of the most brilliant people in Germany all the professors all the intelligent Highly Educated Germans who were killed by Adolf Hitler you see thinking people cannot be tolerated in such a regime downgrade the mindset we must have surfs and Elite Goan katum men's cattle and\n\n(52:28) then the super illuminists how irritating remember that the Jesuit magazine civilta catholica house organ of the Jesuit says quite frankly fascism is the regime regime that corresponds most closely to the concept of the Church of Rome fascism is fascinating excuse the pun fascism has one Central lead leader\n\n(52:56) you see Pope eventually one central leader one central leader total control over the people yet the people believe that they are free because they are getting everything that they require unlike communism they may have property rights but the property rights are qualified and I'll come to that in a later lecture in case you are duped into\n\n(53:18) that now here are these fi let's have a look at them the bundle of Rod accompanied by an axe or a spear which symbolize power over life and death carried by the Roman official as symbol of Authority Under the Republican conlict or pra the starting on an expedition he took his vows on the cap toine Hill where the Vatican sits today\n\n(53:37) this is very symbolic he acclaimed if acclaimed emperator in other words Leader by his troops he decked his FY with a LEL and on his return deposited the wreath upon the capitaline hill everything leads to Rome fascinating story so where you find the fasi you must know that Rome is behind it fascist regimes use the fasi so fasi can\n\n(54:04) look like that with an axe or the axe can go through or it can be a spear like it was in the French Revolution these are fasi now where do we find the fasi well in 1888 campaign poster of encent President Grover Cleveland uh Benjamin Harrison defeated them but later he won Cleveland was reelected to a non\n\n(54:26) consecutive term there he Eagle is standing on two fasy see it fascism hidden in the United States you know the the United States should be as far as the East is from the west from fascism isn't it well well well isn't that fascinating the US capital building if you go right to the tippy toppy that's what you have\n\n(54:48) fasy fasy ey fasi fasi so the United States eventually is going to become a fascist St nobody would have believed that 50 years 100 years ago 10 years ago maybe not even five years ago today what does it look like is there Mighty State control over every single one just like in the times of the SS if\n\n(55:18) you move is there a new uh law coming out which will watch the people of the state yes or no yes Patriot Bill have you heard of that all kinds of interesting laws coming out now what type of government is that interesting there it is did you know that the fasi here fasi behind the rostrom podium of the House of\n\n(55:44) Representatives in Washington DC note the back of the chair resembles a golden axe there it is the axe and the fasi so they knew this all along they're just waiting for the opportunity biding their time ancient Roman coins with a fasy ey here is a fasy ey on the back of a dime in America with a flame there fasi on a\n\n(56:08) US dollar and presidents sitting next to fasi is Washington even Abraham Lincoln sat on a fasi chair here the ins signature of the L National Guard it has fasi the fasi and the Statue of Liberty let's read what Anthony Sutton remember this man who wrote about Skull and Bones educated at the University of London\n\n(56:31) gingham California research fellow Hoover Institute this is an important man let's see what he has to say how the order creates war and revolution talking now about Skull and Bones which is the Illuminati which is the Jesuits behind the scenes as we have seen operational history of the order can only be\n\n(56:48) understood within the framework of heelan dialectic process Hegel the great man who said always create two directions thesis antithesis rub them up against the other who cares how many people die in the process then you have synthesis then you get what you actually want from this Axiom it follows that\n\n(57:13) controlled conflict can create a predetermined history for example when the trilateral commission the subject managed conflict Etc we' read this quote before so I'll just skip it the syn thesis that's which comes together sought by The Establishment is called the New World Order without controlled conflict this new world order will not\n\n(57:36) come about random individual action of persons in society would not lead to this synthesis it's artificial therefore it has to be created so you hear about a war here and a war there and a revolution here in a revolution there revolutions have to be financed you never hear where the money comes from to finance them who finances\n\n(57:58) the revolutions who runs them you see so you have Nazis against Soviet unions North Korea North viam ad nauseum against the United States the conflict built profits while pushing the world ever closer to a One World Government Now isn't it logical that That's what Satan wants he wants a One World Government so in hegelian philosophy the\n\n(58:24) conflict of political rights and political left or thesis and antithesis in hegelian terms is essential to forward movement of history and historical change itself have you noticed that every country has a left party and a right party have you heard about that and your country has it two otherwise there would be no point to\n\n(58:45) vote right two of them now let's have a look how this is worked President woodro Wilson made this statement this is now president speaking some of the biggest men in the United States in the fields of Commerce and Manufacturing know that there is a power so organized so subtle so complete so pervasive that they had better not speak\n\n(59:08) above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it aha so here is a power that controls things Kar and the capital posed capitalism as thesis and communism as antithesis now you'll have Jesuits clamoring for Capital is M and you'll have Jesuits clamoring for communism The Clash of opposites must in\n\n(59:32) the healium system bring about a society neither capitalist nor communist that's synthesis moreover in the hegelian scheme of events this new synthesis will reflect the concept of the state as God and the individually as totally subordinate to an all powerful state if you don't do what the state says Sizzle\n\n(59:54) fits that's what Adolf Hitler practiced two and a half million Germans Sizzle fits gone what then is the function of parliament now take note I'm not saying this I'm reading it I get criticized for this statement you cannot believe please don't criticize me write to these people I'm just quoting what then is the function of a\n\n(1:00:23) parliament a congress for hegelians these institutions are merely to allow individuals to feel that their opinions have some value and to allow a government to take advantage of whatever wisdom The Peasant may accidentally demonstrate all right now let's see how Hegel puts it himself this is now the\n\n(1:00:45) great Philosophy for Hegel where the politicians bow down to him he says by virtue of this participation subjective Liberty and conceit with their General opinion individuals can show themselves palpa palpably efficacious and enjoy the satisfaction of feeling themselves to count for something in other words we're\n\n(1:01:08) just idiots so if you vote who you voting for I'll tell you who you're voting for I always say this they vote for the devil in pink or the devil in blue the vote makes no difference it's a joke po itics is a joke War the organized conflict of Nations for aism is only the visible outcome of the clash between ideas as\n\n(1:01:36) John dwey the hegelian darling of modern education system puts it he's in control of the whole new world education war is the most effective preacher of the vanity of all merely finite interests it put an end to the selfish egoism of the individual by which he would claim his life and his property as his own or as\n\n(1:01:55) his families did you get that now surely Rome doesn't think like that oh I'll show you paper Bulls which will make your hair stand on end new on compare this to the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United States which says absolutely the opposite all right so for these elitists the state is supreme and a\n\n(1:02:19) self-appointed elite running the state acts indeed as God on Earth the rest are kakum cattle goam college textbooks present war and revolution as more or less accidental results of conflict but they never never in Western textbooks will you find the evidence that revolutions need finance and the source of the\n\n(1:02:41) finance in many cases Trace us back to Wall Street operational vehicles for conflict creation the key to modern history is in these facts the elitists have close working relations with both marxists and Nazis they play on both sides because what they have created is just a game in this memor memorandum we will\n\n(1:03:02) present the concept that world history certainly since 1970 reflects deliberately created conflict with the objective of bringing about a synthesis a new world order so let's have a look how it worked here's the order the thesis is Marxist Russia second world war now the antithesis Nazi Germany who financed them who fi\n\n(1:03:27) financed the the Russians guaranteed Trust Company who financed the Nazis guarantee trust company and then you have Harman formerly of Harman and Company etc etc same people over here Harman Nazi interests same people Finance both sides then you have the balik revolution 1917 and 1933 Hitler's Ascension to power conflict between the\n\n(1:03:53) two tremendous profit and the result post World War II United Nations as the first step to a New World Order there you have it beautifully financed by the same sides by 1948 the atomic Race by 1950 Mary receives Pilgrim status 1950 Francis Matthew calls for nuclear war with Russia and they start arguing\n\n(1:04:17) between the two of them notice how many were killed by Stalin among the 1,766 188 victims up to the beginning of 1922 figures obtained from the Soviet documents nearly 5,000 were priests teachers nuns Etc of the Greek Church as soon as the persecution extended to the millions of Lutheran Reformed Baptist Methodist and\n\n(1:04:46) especially menite Christians the circulation of the Bible is not only strictly forbidden but punishable by Exile so that's what Stalin did Stalin killed K Millions we hear of 6 million Jews well think in terms of 30 40 50 million people when you think of Stalin the greatest mass murderer this world has ever\n\n(1:05:09) seen and Foster doth President Kennedy what is the story there well here is Kennedy and he's married to this young lady jacoline Kennedy and they are setting up the United States for a tremendous conflict in the end and every president has to play the game eventually this president dies and this one takes over Lyndon\n\n(1:05:36) Johnson but did you know something interesting a president has to swear on the Bible when he takes over did you know that Lyndon Johnson refused to swear on the Bible what did he swear on Lyndon Johnson is swore in as president by Judge Sarah D Hughes just hour after the assassination judge Hughes brought a\n\n(1:05:56) small Bible for the swearing in ceremony but it was substituted for a Roman missile Mass book that was found on the plane so he swears on a Roman missile he refused to swear on the Bible doesn't that tell you something isn't that interesting I find that very interesting now why did that president have to go he\n\n(1:06:15) was a Roman Catholic after all is it possible that not all Roman Catholics are so easily duped here's the motorcade as it travels along here you have Mrs Kennedy helps the secret service agent Clint hill climb into the car at the back when the president was shot and uh here are the Roses she received very interesting here\n\n(1:06:39) is Dallas 1122 on November 22 1963 John Fitzgerald Kennedy 35th President of the United States visited Dallas that's interesting also the number 11 over there that's the building here's the building from which he was apparently assassinated from that window so they say there it is a little bit larger and uh here's the plaque where\n\n(1:07:11) they have written what happened over here on November 22 the building gained the national not notoriety when Lee Harvey Oswald and somebody did the trouble to underline allegedly shot and killed President John F Kennedy and uh most people don't believe that Lee Harvey Oswald shot the president the president's car came down\n\n(1:07:35) the street that tree was not yet there and was apparently shot from that window over there and it happened approximately where I'm standing relative to this picture now notice as he comes down here he's traveling on this side of the road and imagine hordes of people standing on either side and here is a little uphill\n\n(1:07:58) and when you go further into the Hall over here there was a pick fence and if you looked from the picket fence you could look down onto the street and apparently when the shots were fired over a 100 people including the police it didn't run this way but ran up this embankment towards the picket fence now\n\n(1:08:23) why did they run to the front of the president and not from behind the president apparently they say Lee Harvey oswal shot him from behind and he was the only one who shot and he shot from behind and he hit him over here a very very fantastic shot by the way if it is so he only has a little problem the\n\n(1:08:43) president's head didn't go forward it went backwards and he hit it hit him here in the throat and there was a small entry wound in the front and a huge one in the back so from where was he hit from the front or from the back he was HD from the front not only that there were shots from other places along the side and\n\n(1:09:06) there was an intercalation which all hit the president there's even evidence that the driver himself who happened to be left-handed rotated and shot the president himself with a pistol as well he had multiple shots of the witnesses that ran towards the the picket fence over a hundred of them almost all of them except for one\n\n(1:09:31) or two ladies who were ridiculed were assassinated themselves is that not strange wouldn't you think that was strange if all the witnesses died strangely well this is one of the biggest coverups that probably ever occurred here's the picket fence and when you're looking there that's how it was someone behind the picket fence\n\n(1:09:54) would shoot and this would be the view from the picket fence I'm now pretending to be there I took these pictures myself and the cross would be there so he would shoot the president at this short distance and hit him from the side front now it's interesting that the president's head jerked to his back and\n\n(1:10:17) to his left B like that that means that he must have been shot from the front side right right isn't that logical all right now am I saying this or is this public knowledge this is public knowledge and yet it is denied by government because they have one culprit Lee Harvey oswal there's the place where\n\n(1:10:40) he died stretch shot from the picket fence now let's have a look how JF Kennedy died let's go back to that day in Dallas the day was November 22nd the time shortly before noon at first the crowds were thick but as the mate approached de Plaza it was here that motorcade violated the secret service's own rules as the car turned it\n\n(1:11:09) slowed from 40 m hour to 7even it was precisely then the gunshots blasted out for 6 seconds the occupants of Kennedy's car were struck by bullets Kennedy grasped for his throat graas for his throat Kennedy's head exploded driven with great force backwards and to the left then and only then did the president's car accelerate and speed\n\n(1:11:32) off Lyndon Johnson the new president ordered a federal commission to investigate the crime the Warren Commission had given us the official version lehavi Oswald had acted alone but if all three shots had come from behind then why did the president's head fly backwards why did so many people including policemen run not towards The\n\n(1:11:52) Book Depository where Oswald was but towards the picket fence if the Warren Commission was right why does so many witnesses claim to see something completely different from the official report as many as 177 people died simply from knowing too much the moment Kennedy was killed a massive cover up went into operation Witnesses\n\n(1:12:16) were threatened and many were killed Hill interviewed immediately afterwards shot out and he grabbed his chair there was an inter and then three or four more shots R out for that time the motor St away with us now is Jean Hill is closer to the person's car than anyone else at the time of the shooting Miss Hill is a\n\n(1:12:37) Dallas grade school teacher and has feared for her life for the last 29 years I understand that two men claiming to be Secret Service agents interrogated you after the assassination what were you asked they asked me what I had seen I told them uh that I'd seen the president hit that I saw a shooter from\n\n(1:12:57) the null and that I'd heard 4 to6 shots but they told me I didn't hear it three shots were you ever interviewed by the war commission oh yes I was interviewed by uh our inspector who uh well he tried very hard to discredit everything I said he accused me of all kinds of things from like a Shabby marital Affair to\n\n(1:13:18) seeking publicity to just downright line we found the real facts and certainly no one in the intervening 25 years has disproved our basic conclusions it was Spectre who came up with the so-called magic bullet theory which tracks one bullet going through both Kennedy and Texas governor John Connelly the bullet\n\n(1:13:39) was later discovered virtually intact on Connelly's Hospital stretcher the truth had it been known had it come out revealed there was a conspiracy conspiracy to kill the president needed a skateboard aaty someone who would take the blame truth there were many things you weren't supposed to see like the\n\n(1:13:58) paraffin test given to Oswald it proved conclusively that Oswald had not fired a rifle that day or the spy camera found in Oswald's possessions issued to him by the US government or oswal's letter to a Mr Hunt requesting his next assignment the only hunt we know of in this case is Howard hunt of the CIA who shared the\n\n(1:14:22) same office with Oswald in New Orleans the office belonged to guy Bannister forly with the FBI Not only was this address on oswal's supposedly Pro Castor leaflets but the account oswall used to print the leaflets belonged to the CIA Howard hunt with the CIA guy Bannister with the FBI and Lee Harvey Oswald all\n\n(1:14:43) in the same office kenned motorcade was arranged to make two turns taking him directly into a triangulation the first shot came from the picket fence it hit Kennedy in the throat the second shot came from the Dow Tex building next to the Book Depository it entered Kennedy's back the third shot came from the southwest corner of The\n\n(1:15:09) Book Depository seventh floor it hit con the fourth shot came from the dtech it narrowly missed hit the curb wounding a bystander the fifth and sixth shots were fired almost simultaneously from the deposit and from the picket fence both with Kennedy in the head one from above moving him forward then an instant later\n\n(1:15:35) one from the front tossing him back here you see the passenger in the front turning back looking at the president instead of jumping back to his system he turns forward the driver's now rotating weapon comes into view and he fires you'll see this repeatedly in these sequences Kennedy's been shot in the\n\n(1:15:59) throat he's leaning to his left the driver now begins to rotate his left arm comes over his right shoulder and he fires now again you see the driver rotate you see the weapon come into view he's rotating again the weapon is in view he fires can clearly see his head turning and the his arm and the weapon extending\n\n(1:16:21) into view over his right shoulder one of the first first activities of William Greer after the presidential limousine arrived at Parkland Hospital was to attain a bucket and a sponge and water and begin to wash the blood and brains off of the presidential limousine there's a new theory about the assassination of John F Kennedy a\n\n(1:16:40) government scientist says police audio tapes provide new evidence of a second gunman if it could be proved that the sound on the tape was a gunshot and that in fact it came from the grassy dull then it would provide some evidence that there was a second gunman in addition to Lee Harvey Oswalt but so far few who\n\n(1:16:57) agree with the conclusion made by Thomas hello Yes Rick go ahead please yes I'd like to know why it's taken uh so long for this information and the truth to be exposed in the first place it hasn't been exposed yet and I don't think it ever will be secrecy in government is designed for one purpose and one purpose\n\n(1:17:20) only not to keep the enemy or the opposition from knowing what going on but to keep the American people from knowing what is going on and all the evidence that exists that or might have existed that would implicate uh the government in Kennedy's assassination you can be sure that evidence is now destroyed and so even if everything is\n\n(1:17:43) released now the chances of solving the Kennedy assassination and attaching the BL to the guilty parties is almost impossible Kennedy was changing the Status Quo decided he could no longer trust the CIA he was transferring covert operations directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff shortly after that he fired Alan delis\n\n(1:18:14) who had been the director of Central Intelligence since 1953 Kennedy continued to make enemies as he pulled back from World confrontation he ordered US troops out of Vietnam this was an incident that took place well you saw that driver rotate if you could see it it was very difficult could see his head go back you could see all\n\n(1:18:36) these things Vatican assassin says but after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion President Kennedy changed due to his betrayal by the Jesuit Council of foreign relations in the person of MC George Bundy he sought to break the CIA into a thousand pieces now the CIA would be like the SS why break that then he called for a\n\n(1:18:59) return to America's currency to the gold standard that was a major problem that would stop the Federal Reserve and another thing that he said he said I will separate church and state I think that was a big mistake that he made in the eyes of the Jesuits remember that Lola said finally let all with such artfulness gain the\n\n(1:19:22) ascendant over princes noblemen and magistrates of every place that they may be ready at our back even to sacrifice their nearest relations and most intimate friends when we say it is for our interest and advantage that's fascinating we know of course that jacalene Kennedy was raised in a Jesuit Convent but let's leave it there one of\n\n(1:19:46) Nixon's main speech writers during three whole years was Jesuit father the Reverend John mclin who wrote Nixon's spe teachers at a salary of 32,000 a year which was a lot of money at that time and the next presidents one of the next ones Gerald Ford there's his own signature 33Â° Freemason I took this picture myself in\n\n(1:20:06) the Masonic Lodge there he signs it 33Â° Freemason these people are not who they say they are and when we look at him and we look at these handshakes that they have and uh the holy alliance between the papacy and the United States of America this is by the way a signal picture and Reagan appointed this man to be uh\n\n(1:20:34) representative to the Vatican so by 1987 Pope John Paul visits the United States President Dragon meets him and he says as you exalt us we will listen this is not separation of church and state for with all our hearts we earn to make this good land better still the pope is quoted as saying I come as a friend a\n\n(1:20:52) friend of America and of all Americans Catholics Orthodox Jews all men of good willll well interesting here he is together this by the way also a masonic signal picture but we won't go into the details that's also a masonic signal picture we won't go into those details how do they plan their trips let's ask\n\n(1:21:12) them here's Ronald Reagan planning his trip to this President of Russia and then in September goov proposed a pre-summit meeting in rovit Iceland Washington agreed the astrologer fixed the time of the date of departure and at 9:45 on October the 9th Reagan flew to rovic for instance if you have very bad Saturn you should cultivate\n\n(1:21:37) Jupiter so that wow he's now acting like Nebuchadnezzar let's call the astrologist to tell us when this meeting should take place you know the 11th is a very important date presidents die on it buildings collapse on it it's very interesting my Pope Pope Paul II I confirm for you as the pope of my secret the pope about\n\n(1:22:01) whom I spoke to the children during the apparitions the pope of my love and my sorrow this is what Mary apparently said to the children at Fatima this is the pope of the secret or these is the the Mary predicted that he would have an assassination this Pope and the modern channels through father GOI say that\n\n(1:22:24) this this is the pope of the promise well Malachi Martin in the keys of this Blood this uh is a pontifical work wres for a new world order had begun and Pope John Paul would stride now in the arena of the Millennium endgame as something more than a geopolitical giant of his age he was and Remains the Serene and\n\n(1:22:50) confident servant of The Grand Design there's another Masonic language he is going to be the head honcho the main man all this Bloodshed all these wars in Germany what happened what did the war do in Germany the second world war in Germany the north of Germany was devastated it was firebombed which was\n\n(1:23:14) illegal according to all conventions they threw fire bombs on the north of Germany hurg was gutted by fire bombs now fire bombs don't just destroy military targets what do they destroy they burn human beings alive so it was targeted to destroy the people and then East Germany the entire Protestant conclave was cut out and handed over to\n\n(1:23:40) Soviet Russia for two generations of enforced atheism today there's no Protestant left anymore protestantism has been destroyed the Orthodox church has been subj educated all of them are subject to Rome millions of serbians died Millions it has been a Slaughter in the last centuries such as this world has\n\n(1:24:08) not seen why to gain full control of the world the pope sits on the altar of korazim this is when he visited uh Jerusalem and Israel recently Israel the backdrop depicts Christ with an open book that reads love your enemies I will come soon what else do you see on his throne an upside down cross there's the\n\n(1:24:38) pope too with an upside down cross symbol of Lucifer's victory over Jesus this is a sad State of Affairs and we looked at the teachings of illuminism we looked at the teachings of the Masonic order of the secret societies and we saw that Lucifer was their God they said so themselves and what do we have to do\n\n(1:25:05) come out of her my people that you not be partakers of her sins I believe that we are on the threshold of History I believe that the final events are unfolding and I believe that we need have no fear here because God said that he would give them the opportunity to show their true colors the final apostasy against God will end\n\n(1:25:36) in the greatest Victory the universe has ever seen and the kingdom of God will soon be ushered in if you thought that this was long in the future I have news for you it is at the the door Jesus is coming soon thank you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause]\n\n(1:28:21) [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:216_the_crime_of_the_antichrist_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSabbath Observance,God's Authority,Mark of the Beast,Biblical Prophecy,Christian Tradition\n\n## Guide:\nThis presentation by Walter Veith, \"The Crime of the Antichrist,\" interprets biblical prophecy, particularly from Daniel and Revelation, to highlight a central conflict between God's authority and a rival power. Veith argues that a \"beast\" or \"little horn\" power, identified with the Roman Catholic Church, presumptuously attempts to change God's times and laws, specifically the Sabbath commandment. He asserts that the Sabbath (Saturday) serves as God's distinctive mark or seal, representing His authority as Creator, while the Sunday observance, adopted by many Christian denominations, is presented as the rival power's mark, based on tradition rather than scripture. The lecture meticulously examines biblical texts that are often used to support Sunday worship, concluding that none actually endorse a change from the Sabbath, and emphasizes that obedience to God's commandments, especially the Sabbath, is a test of allegiance.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 216 - The Crime of The Antichrist / Total Onslaught - Walter Veith www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGKVejfxgPg\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the crime of the Antichrist now we've dealt with some of these issues already yesterday but perhaps we just want to put one or two things into perspective and see where we're heading before I do that what is a beast in the Bible govern it's a political entity now we find the\n\n(01:23) beast in Revelation as well and uh we find that beast in Revelation 13 and it rises up out of the sea amongst the Nations and then it has all the attributes of the little horn all the attributes of the little horn and we'll deal with that prophecy in detail I think it is tomorrow night tomorrow night and somebody asked me earlier is\n\n(01:50) America in Prophecy well come and listen tomorrow night and let's have a look what the Bible says and then you decide for yourself if it's in there or whether it's not in there I mean this is this is a thunderous time that we're living in now you know if something Walks Like A Duck and it looks like a duck and it\n\n(02:11) quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck right so if if something has exactly the same attributes as the little horn in Daniel chapter 7 then what is the probability that it is the little horn in Daniel chapter 7 pretty good right okay so this power we'll be dealing with tomorrow night and there is just so much\n\n(02:35) to deal with you cannot open it up all in one evening but uh let's have a look at this little horn power and look at some of the aspects of what it did the little horn power in Daniel 7:25 we saw last night would think to change times and laws of course he says that he can change times and laws he can change\n\n(02:59) change the times he can change God's law but in actual fact he only presumes to he is presumptuous nobody can change God's law and get away with it would you agree remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the of the Lord thy God and that you shall\n\n(03:28) not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for there's a reason in six days God made the heavens and the earth now what is the evolution Theory to that text was it in the waste paper basket how many lectures did we spend here\n\n(03:51) saying that you cannot throw that text into the waste paper basket was it full I think so you cannot throw that in the waste paper basket now why so much effort to throw that piece in the waste paper basket because if that piece is not in the waste paper basket then you're in trouble with this one the sea and all that in them is and\n\n(04:15) he rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it Exodus 28 to1 that means he set it aside for Holy use now Man was created male and female representing communication on the horizontal level he Wass to be Confederate but without God in the equation you have what you have today\n\n(04:47) total chaos not only in marriage but in general you have to have God in the equation this is quite an interesting story when I first came into contact with God I was actually quite jealous of him because he requires first place and I was married to my wife and she was all mine and now I had to share her that was\n\n(05:16) tough I I I walked around with a lip this long for quite a while while I was muding this over maybe I'm just a bit weird but I was thinking about these things now eventually when I started realizing the character of God and his total selfishness if someone is 100% selfless like Jesus was he poured himself out for\n\n(05:41) mankind if he's 100% selfish then how much are you going to get out of the deal if you are dealing with such an individual you're going to get 100% And that's the beauty of it you see if you love God supremely you get get God's love supremely unselfishly poured out upon you and the blessing becomes so great that the\n\n(06:09) relationship between a man and a woman gets increased in relationship Glory whatever you want to call it millions of times it gets enhanced because God is in the equation in fact God can set so many of our self rituals straight how many people are linked to each other by selfish ties that the one may not do this or that or the other\n\n(06:41) because the other one restrains him now if you have the spirit of God in you you become selfless and your whole view changes and you want to make the other one more happy by giving more and more freedom and of course that is dangerous in the eyes of the world because Freedom means you can do what you want to so\n\n(07:04) it's a question of choice so if you're making your choices within the Realms of what God has defined is right and good then the relationship can blossom it's absolutely amazing so here God says that you must keep the Sabbath day for in six days the Lord made the heavens the Earth the sea and all that is in them but is\n\n(07:26) he's the Creator he's the one that brought it all about and he rested on the seventh day he rested was God tired no no God wasn't tired so what is this rest that he found in his relationship with man he rested because in man he found the Fulfillment of his whole plan for the entire universe his whole plan in man\n\n(07:58) was to be made manifest the glory of God he created man for his own Glory says the Bible in other words man was to reflect to the universe the glory and the wisdom of God it's a noble noble purpose tremendous thoughts so here God looked at this new creation of his and he found rest in it it's it's like when\n\n(08:26) you have a new relationship you met this woman of your dreams or if you are of the opposite sex this man of your dreams and you've been separated for a while and now you come together again for the first time and you look at each other and you hold each other and you have nothing to say except rest to find rest in the\n\n(08:56) relationship does that make any sense so goded he found peace in the relationship even though he knew that war was going to break out all around him as a consequence because the devil was angry when he created man he was angry but God found rest in man and man can find rest in God in spite of what's going on\n\n(09:24) around us so he rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it do you know that two lovers that really love each other can find rest in each other even if the whole world is going up in smoke around them did you know that absolutely so we can only find rest in God so God\n\n(09:48) took this sabbath day and set it aside for a holy purpose he said to man you go and have dominion you go and do whatever you want to do you place the world under you put it into subjection change it modify it do whatever you like but once a week let's come and have Holy Communion together we will talk every\n\n(10:11) day we will walk together every day we will commune every day but let's set a day aside that's what it is all about Exodus 20111 for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth the sea and all the in them and he rested and the Hebrew word used there is is nah whereas previously it was Shabbat the seventh day wherefore the\n\n(10:37) Lord blessed the Sabbath day and he hallowed it and this if you look it up in the Strong's Concordance means to rest to settle down it means to be Confederate it's like I've been explaining to be together to have this feeling that wow this is great we Belong Together moreover also I gave them my sabbaths to\n\n(11:06) be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that sanctify them this holy relationship this capacity to do what is right this will to do what is Right comes from God and so the lord gave the Sabbath as a sign between them that they may know that he the Lord is the one that sanctifies them ex Ezekiel 20:2 and 20\n\n(11:39) so here's another parallel text and hallow my sabbaths hallow them and they shall be a sign between me and you that you may know that I am the Lord your God this is weird is it possible that somebody else could be the Lord your God yes or no yes it is well many people the ancient folks even the Israelites\n\n(12:03) constantly strayed and bowed down to another deity whoever he was whether he was M or whether he was Bal or whether he was whatever or they worshiped Ash the Queen of Heaven all these strange deities God says no no no listen here I make a packed with you hallow my Sabbath and it shall be a sign between me and\n\n(12:28) you that you may know that I am the Lord your God it's like a test it's like a test Exodus 31 verse 13 speak thou also unto the children of Israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your Generations that you may know that I am the Lord that does sanctify you not\n\n(12:55) another I am the one Exodus 31:6 wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generation for a Perpetual Covenant for a Perpetual Covenant now let's have a look at this sign it is a sign Hebrews the word there is oath between me and the children of Israel\n\n(13:22) forever why for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth and rested on the seventh day and he was refreshed very interesting verse this so it is a sign and why because God is your creator he's your owner he says there choose me I am the one who made you all the others didn't make you they're just\n\n(13:48) stealing you and offering you nothing in return but death so it is a sign and God was refreshed now what does that word sign mean well if you look up the Hebrew again and it says it is a token it is an endine it is a miracle if you like and it is a mark it is a standard is a mark a signal a distinguishing mark\n\n(14:13) That's the strong concordance definition of the word so does God have a mark yes what is it sabath it's a Sabbath God has a mark does the Beast have a mark yeah that's called The Mark of the Beast I wonder what that is is it a computer in Brussel is it a barcode that will be chapped onto your hand is it something\n\n(14:39) that you find on a can of beans if you look at the bottom is God interested in lines on the can of beans or is he interested in your character and in Your Allegiance what is he interested in in your character and in Your Allegiance so let's have a look at this very carefully all right so we we' now established that\n\n(15:00) God has a mark a sign and it is the Sabbath so it is a Mark or a sign between me and the children of Israel forever for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth and the seventh day he rested and he was refreshed so we must understand God's Mark he sign or a seal these are synonyms let's have a look at the Seal\n\n(15:28) of the United States seeing that we are in the United States a seal authenticates a document this is the Seal of the president of the United States of America and this was a typical Royal seal this was the Seal of George II Regent King of England note the three elements it gives his name George the 6\n\n(15:53) and it gives his title which is King and it gives his territory which is great Britain and the dominions so a typical seal has all those components the title and it has the name and it has the territory and without it a law would be useless it would have no Authority now the decalog is a law it is the law of\n\n(16:22) God now this whole law has its Authority only because it has a seal in it God's seal is in the heart of God's law let's listen to this carefully all the other Commandments are just Commandments Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that thou shalt not have another God besides me Thou shalt not use the name in vain\n\n(16:51) honor your parents and your and you will have a long life Etc but here there's something special remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shall your labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God for in six days the Lord there's the name that's yve that's God's\n\n(17:10) name we have name he made the heavens and the Earth so that is the title he's the Creator and what is the Dominion Heaven Earth sea all that is in them so there you have the Dominion all the elements are there and without the Sabbath the law would have no authenticity it would be just another document but now it has the stamp of God\n\n(17:41) yve your creator Dominion Heaven Earth sea everything every nation everything that was ever created it's under my Dominion now if the United States makes a law a new law and proclaims a new law then that law must be signed by whom before it comes into effect the president the president must sign it and\n\n(18:08) if the president doesn't sign it the law is not valid is that right all right now imagine I always use a parable to explain this imagine we place ourselves back sometime there in the times of Germany and Adolf Hitler comes to power and he so impressed with his power he wants to make sure that there is no\n\n(18:34) opposition so he proclaims a law it's just a hypothetical story it's a nonsense story but it's just there to illustrate a point he proclaims a law and he says next Wednesday 12:00 I want the German people to come onto the streets and Proclaim their solidarity for Me by One Voice shouting H Hitler on that particular day on\n\n(19:03) Wednesday at whatever time 12:00 1:00 let's say 12:00 everybody has to do it and the gapo is out and the military police is out and the parades are full how many of the German people would have appeared on the street that day just about everybody and there they go and when the clock strikes they all\n\n(19:26) show their solidarity now I was so impressed with that that I make a law and I said no no no no next Thursday at 12:00 everybody has to come onto the street and Shout H Walter fight send that out to everyone in Germany next Thursday comes around how many people appear on the streets not one single sausage that's not fair why not why'\n\n(19:57) they do it for that boo not for me what's the difference I don't have the authority I don't have the title I don't have the jurisdiction does that make sense so his counts mine counts for nothing mine counts for nothing I had the same law but it means nothing Well adov Hitler got so excited when he got such a\n\n(20:21) positive response it never happened by the way but he decides to write the same law and he sends it let's say to Russia and says next Wednesday 12:00 I want the Russian people on the roads and shouting the same thing how many Russians would appear on the streets not one maybe they would appear to mock him what's the difference why\n\n(20:44) did it work in Germany and not in [Music] Russia he didn't have the jurisdiction he might have had a title and he might have had all those things but he didn't have the jurisdiction so here we have all of these in one shot the Lord that's his name we have the jurisdiction we have the title The Creator and we have\n\n(21:04) the jurisdiction which includes everything on Earth and in heaven so everybody has to obey him this makes the law authentic and gives power to the whole of the law without the Sabbath without that signature the whole law becomes just another document with rules not saying where it comes from not saying who has has the authority so the\n\n(21:30) Lord the Creator heaven and earth that is what authenticates the whole law everybody understand that without it the law is not authenticated so this seal contains his name his title and his territory moreover I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that Sanctified\n\n(21:52) them so now how do I show God that I am willing to obey him do I put up a big banner do I wear a certain dress do I put a certain hat on my head do I do whatever or do I just obey him and keep that day because he said so isn't that the greatest sign of all if you just do it because he said so wow that's fantastic now what if\n\n(22:23) somebody else comes along and says now hang on a second hang on a a second what's going on here who do you think you are obeying that precept and giving your allegiance to that power I'm telling you I don't want you to obey them I want you to obey me and I'm telling you let's change this let's check who has\n\n(22:46) Authority in your life is it God or is it me and I'm telling you you better obey me rather than God would you have a problem yeah sure you have a problem I always use another Parable par Parable I always tell the story of let's say for example again this is totally hypothetical right it's a nice Parable I\n\n(23:11) always use it and everybody always misunderstands it and they think it's really true but it's not true it's just a parable assume I'm married to my wife many years and I have children and then one day some other Bozo comes along is that an acceptable word in this country I don't know he comes along and he gets my wife to\n\n(23:34) follow him and she leaves me and moves in with this other guy marries him and takes the kids with him now I'm devastated devastated there she is with this other guy and why she wants to choose this guy with the cauliflower ears and the buck teeth in the first place I don't know but she's off with him and she's left me and now I had\n\n(23:57) certain rules in my house let's say the kids have to be in bed at a certain time or they have to do their homework or they have to help in the house and they're not allowed to watch bad stuff on television and if they go out they have to be back at a reasonable time stuff like that normal stuff and this new guy says to the kids\n\n(24:16) when they move in listen in this house I The Authority in your lives as far as this house is concerned and I want you to keep your you know live tidily and help in the house and not to be too late when you come home and and uh you know all the good things that I had as well would I have a problem with any of those\n\n(24:34) rules that he made yes or no no I would have no problem with them whatsoever but then he has one extra Rule and he says to my kids listen I have one extra rule your dad has had authority over you in the past your dad had authority over you in the past but that is over I am the new Authority in your life and you will\n\n(25:02) obey me and the kids say hang on a second we have visitation times with my dad on certain days he only has that particular day which he specified CU it's the right one or whatever and this guy says no way you will listen to me no longer to your dad would I have a problem with that rule yeah I probably go around and\n\n(25:26) modify his nose by turning it around 360Â° right now why does that rule irritate me because it affects my authority Nobody messes with my authority when it comes to my kids they're my kids too they're my kids too now God feels the same way we are his kids and another power comes along and says I don't care about these other\n\n(25:50) rules but this particular one the one that tests Authority you will obey me and not God hey God says I'll turn your nose around 360Â° whether you like it or not and he will and he will it's going to happen so God says I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that sanctifies\n\n(26:12) them Isaiah 58:13 says if you turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight I'm not talking about the way the Jews kept the Sabbath a ritual where you do this and you're not allowed to do that you're not allowed to eat egg that was laid on the Sabbath and you're not\n\n(26:31) allowed to do this that and the other walk so many yards or whatever no no no no that's a burden it says here he call the Sabbath a delight not the burden the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him and not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt\n\n(26:52) thou Delight thyselves in the Lord and I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the of the Earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it he says if you honor my authority in your life and you spend it with me and you allow me to sanctify you you will\n\n(27:13) you will be happy and you will have the heritage of Jacob which is eternal life and what about the strangers did it apply only to the Jews this sabbath day Isaiah 566 and 7 all the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone\n\n(27:35) that keeps the Sabbath the Sabbath became the sign of your allegiance to the deity called yve it was the sign even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people so if a stranger came did he have to accept the Sabbath yes or\n\n(28:00) no yes sure he had to accept the Sabbath Deuteronomy 11:13 to20 and it will be for you if you will listen carefully to my Commandments which I command you today take heed to yourselves that your heart may not be deceived the Commandments are the law they're riched you cannot change them and you turn aside and serve other gods\n\n(28:24) and worship them so is there a possibility that this conflict could arise yes or no certainly could therefore now listen carefully you shall lay up these my words in your hearts talking about the Commandments of God and in your souls and bind them for a sign upon your hand listen carefully now on your hand so that they may may be as\n\n(28:52) frontlets between your eyes so where must the Commandments of God God be placed on your hand and in your forehead wow is there a mark of a beast that must be placed on the hand or the for yes or no oh but the Commandments of God must be on your hand on your forehead now the Jews were very clever they wrote out the\n\n(29:19) Ten Commandments on a little plaque and stuck them on the hand and stuck them on the front and they all the deed was done I've got the law in my hand I've got the law in my Forest big deal do you think what God had in mind that would be so silly it would be unbelievable God never had that in mind what did he have in mind when he said\n\n(29:41) that he said tie them to your hand act accordingly put them in there think accordingly doesn't that make sense it's got nothing to do with an outward sign God is not silly and and these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart that's where he wanted them I wonder whether they cut it open over\n\n(30:05) here and put the plaque inside there as well no they didn't and you shall carefully teach them to your sons and you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes here in your cognitive thinking this is God's law I will keep God's law he is my God I will follow him that's what it\n\n(30:29) says continue in Exodus 13:9 it shall be a sign unto them upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth it's pretty clear what must be on the forehead and on the hand the law of God it's got nothing to do with a barcode from a can of beans or whatever it's got to do with the law of God that\n\n(30:57) has to be on your hand hand and that has to be in your forehead now what about that other guy with a cauliflower ears and the buck teeth who takes away the followers of God actually he doesn't have cauliflower ears and buck teeth he's actually quite handsome it's quite irritating but in any case takes them\n\n(31:16) away and misleads them misleads them and he says no no no no my sign my mark on your forehead or your hand well let's have a look what was the purpose then of the Sabbath it was a day of rest it was a day of blessing it was a day of peace it was a sign it was a memorial to Creation it was a symbol of\n\n(31:46) sanctification it was a hallowed day and it was a Perpetual Covenant that was what there was and remember Mark 2:27 the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath that doesn't get rid of the Sabbath it just tells you that man needs the Sabbath man needs this communication with his God and he\n\n(32:11) must know who his God is the god that we serve is the god of the Sabbath that's the god whom we serve otherwise who is he is it the one of the Friday is it the one of the Sunday is it the one of the Wednesday is it a god of the Hindus is it the one the Buddhists is it the one of the shintu is it this one is it that\n\n(32:31) one I'll tell you what it's the god of the Sabbath simple as that that's what the Bible says oh that thou hearkened unto my Commandments then th had peace then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea Isaiah 48:18 you would know exactly where you stand or where you are\n\n(32:50) Deuteronomy 5:29 oh that there was such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments nine of them them or all of them all my Commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children forever well having established that then why do we keep Sunday why don't we keep the Sabbath why\n\n(33:16) does the Christian World keep Sunday Sunday let's ask Webster's International dictionary what it means some of the new diction dictionaries get quite sneaky you got to watch it in the old days they used to define it like this so-called because this day was anciently dedicated to the Sun or its worship Chef's encyclopedia says Sunday\n\n(33:40) dear Solace of the Roman Calendar day of the sun being dedicated to the Sun the first day of the week most Oxford dictionaries will say Sunday first day of the week New Oxford dictionaries will say Sunday day following Saturday day that's pathetic that's not a definition anymore that's a definition in terms of\n\n(34:03) another definition doesn't mean anything anymore but there you have it that's what it is it's the day of the sun it's dear Solace of the Roman Canada the day of the Sun and it's the first day of the week it's not the seventh day of the week Sabbath a Hebrew word signifying rest Sunday was a name given by the\n\n(34:25) heathens to the first day of the week because it was the the day on which they worship the son John EDD a Bible cyclopedia page 561 you can check it out I mean it's all there the reference are there take your ordinary dictionary at home and see what that says so the Sabbath is not Sunday it's Saturday\n\n(34:45) Sunday is the first day of the week but the Christian World Keeps Sunday let's have a look at a at a photocopy if you like a photograph of a of a dictionary sth day Saturday the seventh day of the week Saturday the seventh day of the week Daniel 7:25 remember said and he the little horn who identified him last\n\n(35:13) night shall speak words against the most high shall work wear out the Saints of the most high and plot to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time times and a half a time now re ration 13:7 talks about this Beast that has all the attributes of the little horn and we've already said if it\n\n(35:36) looks like a duck and Walks Like A Duck and quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck so this Beast is exactly the same power as the little horn power and we are told that this Beast will Implement with the aid of another Power which we will deal with tomorrow night the mark of this Beast now we've already\n\n(35:57) established what what God's Mark was what was it the Sabbath and where was it to be written on the forward and on the hand now it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and the power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations Revelation 13:7 and he causes all both small and\n\n(36:21) great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forests and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name fascinating text fascinating text we will deal with this in detail and take it apart every aspect of that text\n\n(36:48) we will open up one little difference between God's Mark and the Beast marks and it's just a tiny little difference it lies over here it says all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads Gods was to be in the right hand and in the forehead God\n\n(37:18) is not satisfied with halfway service All or nothing this Beast is happy if you have it in your forehead that is you think it's right and you act accordingly but he's also happy if you don't think it's right if you go along with it because you have no other choice so act accordingly because he said so then he's\n\n(37:40) also will leave you alone does that make sense as long as you obey him he doesn't care how whether you're convinced or not as long as you obey him wow and if you don't do it economic boycott you will not be able to buy yourselves we'll freeze your bank account will freeze it and save that you have this Mark or the name of the Beast\n\n(38:04) stands for its character or the number and we'll be dealing with that as well now let's have a look at the Roman decretal now this comes from a Roman Catholic Source deal translat episcope he the pope can pronounce sentences and judgments in contradictions to the rights of Nations to the law of God and\n\n(38:25) man he's a mighty man he's might ier than God or any Nation on Earth he can free himself from the commands of the Apostles he being their Superior and from the rules of the Old Testament he can do whatever he likes we read further the pope has the power to change times to abrogate laws and to dispense with all things even the\n\n(38:46) precepts of Christ so no matter what the old husband said I'm the new husband around here you won't listen to your previous dad you'll listen to me have we got this other the guy around yes or no yes we have him around there he is let's see what he says 2 Thessalonians 23:4 let no man deceive you by any means for\n\n(39:07) that day shall not come except they come a falling away first and that man of sin which is transgressing of the law will be revealed the son of ption who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God he's the other guy and his days coming when his nose will be twisted 360 degrees not by me or\n\n(39:28) by any man but by God without human hands the Bible says Pope Nicholas quoted in facts for the time Pope the Pope's will stands for reason he can dispense Above the Law and of wrong make right by correcting and changing laws he's a powerful guy he can do whatever he likes ask the Catholic Church which is\n\n(39:53) the Sabbath day it says Saturday is the Sabbath day your dad said Keep Saturday but I'm telling you no visitation on that day then why do You observe Sunday instead of Saturday why because I'm the new Authority in your life and we observe Sunday instead of Saturday because we the Catholic Church transferred the solity from Saturday to\n\n(40:13) Sunday this is not just any Source this is the converts catechism of Catholic Doctrine 1957 that's pretty straight out of the horse's mouth this is the new boyfriend and he says you will not listen listen to your dad you'll listen to me because I said so so what is he attacking isn't he attacking the\n\n(40:35) authority of God you cannot attack the authority of God of God on the strength of any other commandment except the Sabbath you can only attack the authority of God on the strength of the Sabbath because that is what determines the authority so what is the mark of the beast then we have a beast we have a beast that say is you\n\n(40:57) will accept my mark and you'll have it on your hand or your forehead we have a seal of God which is a mark which says you will keep the Commandments of God on your hands and on your foreheads whoa we're coming to an impass there's no compromise here what does the Beast say what is its mark this is the Catholic\n\n(41:16) record September 1 1923 they say Sunday is our Mark of authority so what is the mark of the beast then what does it say it says Sunday the church is above the Bible wow I'm the new boyfriend you don't listen to the rules of your dad you listen to me and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact\n\n(41:46) Catholic record there they say it so we have two marks on this earth and the choice is ours either we obey God or we obey the new boyfriend that's it so Satan has attacked the Sabbath because it is the Seal of God it affects the authority of god let's have some more quotes Catholic World March 1894 she took the Pagan Sunday and made it\n\n(42:10) the Christian Sunday and thus the Pagan Sunday dedicated to balda that's Bal became the Christian Sunday sacred to Jesus interesting let's take another one Faith of Our Fathers Cardinal Gibbons of course of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act and the act and he reiterates it is a mark\n\n(42:34) of her ecclesiastical power she says she's mightier than God in this issue I don't care what laws God Made You will listen to me this is real arrogance the Bible says remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day the Catholic Church says no they're pretty straight who's this speaking oh it's father enrite writing\n\n(43:00) in the American Sentinel this is the Catholic Church spokesman he says the Bible says so but the Catholic Church says no by my divine power I abolish the Sabbath day and command you to keep holy the first day of the week and L the entire civilized World bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the\n\n(43:21) Holy Catholic Church isn't that arrogance beyond measure it is so arrogant freaks me out by my divine power well if that's their divine power then it must be a different divine power to God's divine power right or wrong there's another God on Earth who sets himself up in the temple of God claiming to be God so we have two that\n\n(43:48) we are serving of course the Catholic church is not really God it must have another Power behind it and the Bible says and the dragon gave him his seat and power and great Authority those are very sad words and I don't say them flippantly kismos Romanos pop pasas 1566 commanded by the Council of Trent it\n\n(44:14) pleased the Church of God that the religious celebration of the Sabbath day should be transferred to the Lord's day Sunday over and over they say I was in a spirit on the Lord's Day Revelation 1:10 they say well the Lord's day was Sunday it doesn't say so it says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day doesn't say\n\n(44:32) what day it was only the Bible can say which is the Lord's day and there it is Isaiah 58:13 if thou turn thy foot away from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath Delight the holy of the Lord so which is the Lord's Day according to the Bible the Sabbath not Sunday so I was in the spirit on the\n\n(44:54) Lord's day it doesn't really cut any ice what about this one therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath does that do away with the Sabbath or established who is in Authority when it comes to the Sabbath by the way who created this worldus was it the father or was it through the sun through the sun it was\n\n(45:15) through the sun you go and read John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God everything that was created on this world was created through him and for him by his word it stands so Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath Catholic Press Sydney August 25 19008 Sunday is a Catholic institution\n\n(45:42) and its claims to observance can be defended only on Catholic principles these are all Catholic quotes from the beginning to the end of scriptures there's not a single passage which warrant the transfer of the weekly public worship from the last day of the week to the first they are so straightforward on this you may read the\n\n(45:58) Bible from Genesis to Revelation and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday the scriptures enforce the religious observant of Saturday James gardenal kibbons the Faith of Our Fathers the Catholic church is throwing out the gauntlet and saying there take it or leave it\n\n(46:18) choose the Christian Sabbath is to this day the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church a spouse of the Holy Ghost without a word of remonstrance from the pro Protestant World Catholic mirror September 23 so they say to the Protestants you say you're Protestants why you obey us then if you obey us then\n\n(46:35) you ours whether you like it or not they're so arrogant Chancellor of the arch dases of Baltimore reping for the Cardinal in a letter dated 19 uh February 10 1920 if Protestants would follow the Bible they should worship God on the Sabbath day in keeping the Sunday they are following a law of the Catholic\n\n(46:55) church this is the Catholic Church speaking John Gib Shay American Catholic quarterly review protestantism and discarding the authority of the Roman Church has no good reason for for its Sunday Theory and ought logically to keep Saturday as the Sabbath not the Creator this is really arrogant not the creator of the universe\n\n(47:19) in Genesis 21 and three but the Catholic church can claim the honor of having granted man a pause to work every seven days this is so arrogant it blows my mind those quotes I've never seen this is unbelievable and this one was made not in the Middle Ages this was made in 1969 reason and Common Sense demand and\n\n(47:45) this one should really clinch it re reason and Common Sense demand acceptance of one or the other of these Alternatives either protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday or catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday compromise is impossible there you go Catholic mirror December 23 1893 there's the battle line if you obey\n\n(48:14) God you keep which day Saturday if you obey the Catholic Church you keep Sunday that's what they're saying so if you're a Protestant but you're keeping Sunday you're really obeying whom the pope you're Bing the Pope that doesn't mean that Protestants out there who have never heard this information now have\n\n(48:34) the mark of the beast they don't because God is judging them according to the light that they have but this issue is going to become prominent very very soon because the present Pope the present Pope has asked for worldwide Sunday legislation and your president had said we want to implement his teachings\n\n(48:57) that's interesting I'll show it to you still I'll show it to you so now why do Protestants keep on keeping Sunday well what do they say do they know this or don't they know this yes they know it yes they know it let's have it run through them quickly the Episcopal say is there any commandment in the New Testament to change the day\n\n(49:17) of weekly rest from Saturday to Sunday none Manual of Christian doctrine that's well that's their their big writing we have made a change from Seventh Day to the first day from Saturday to Sunday on the authority of the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ why we keep Sunday that's the Episcopal Church\n\n(49:35) well they're so near to the Catholics it's you know it's just sort of a a hiccup between them but they say they know but they keep Sunday all right what about the other Protestant groups the Lutheran Church we observe the Lord's day Sunday is founded or the observance of the Lord's day Sunday is founded not\n\n(49:55) on any command of God but on the authority of the church this is the alburg confession this is the central document for Lutheranism in the Catholic Sabbath manual part two section one they know it all right what about the Presbyterians a change of the day to be observed from the last day of the week\n\n(50:15) to the first there is no record no Express command authorizing the change this is the Christian shabath Sabbath NL rice one of their spokespersons fine what about the methodists take the matter of Sunday there's no passage telling Christians to keep that day or to transfer the Jewish sabbath to that day Christian Advocate July 2 1942\n\n(50:36) so the methodists know it well what's going on here what about the congregationalists it's quite clear that however rigidly or devoutly we spend Sunday we are not keeping the Sabbath there's not a single sentence in the New Testament to suggest that we incur any penal penalty by violating the supposed\n\n(50:52) sanctity of Sunday this is The Ten Commandments by Dr Dale all right that's the congregationalists is there anybody out there hello anglicans many people think that Sunday is the Sabbath but neither in the New Testament nor in the early church is there anything to suggest that we have any right to transfer the observance of\n\n(51:09) the seventh day of the week to the first the Sabbath was an East Saturday not Sunday reverent lion beer Church of the people there we go well what about the Baptists there was an EAS a commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day but that Sabbath was not Sunday there is no scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution\n\n(51:30) from the seventh day to the first day of the week is this anybody speaking oh no this is Hicks hiscox he's the author of the Baptist manual he should know so they all know every single one of them knows here's another one Reverend Philip car AR Bishop Quebec he sent them all in a Scurry saying outright that there was\n\n(51:49) nothing to support Sunday being kept Hing he definitely told the church meeting in this city of straight laac Protestant ISM that tradition not the Bible had made Sunday the day of worship Toronto Daily Star so tradition Pagan tradition introduced by Rome kept it now what does the Lord say about tradition let's read that almost\n\n(52:12) all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred Mysteries the Lord's Supper on the Sabbath of every week yet the Christians are now know this of Alexandria and at Rome on account of some ancient tradition had have ceased to do this this is ecclesiastical history now Alexandria is the one where\n\n(52:32) all the Pagan doctrines were introduced this where the sades learned that there was no Resurrection but that when you go to heaven you go and sit on Abraham's lap and Jesus said hey what are you teaching there there's no such thing so Alexandria and Rome are the seat of paganism Alexandria taught ancient Egyptian Gnostic\n\n(52:58) Mysteries and based on cabalism and gnosticism ancient tradition well Catholic record says Sunday is founded not on scripture but on tradition and is a distinctly Catholic institution we will deal with that in some astounding detail what paganism has done and how occultism has controlled some of these decisions the\n\n(53:23) New Testament makes no explicit mention that the Apostle Chang the day of worship but we know it from tradition this is the revised Baltimore catechism so these are the authorative documents of the church it's all based on tradition and the Bible says Matthew 15 36 and9 he answered and said to them why\n\n(53:45) do you transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition and you voided the Commandments of God by your tradition but in vain they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men can you do it yes or no no you can't you cannot substitute tradition for obedience these people honor me with their lips but their\n\n(54:10) hearts are far from me they worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men and he said to them you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own Traditions Mark 7 and9 n so the Bible says one thing the Rome says another and here we have a basis for\n\n(54:34) conflict and this basis for conflict is going to rise like a mushroom and it's going to come to a head very very soon the authority of the church could therefore not be bound by the authority of the scriptures because the church had changed the Sabbath into Sunday not by the command of Christ but by its own\n\n(54:57) authority Canon and tradition page 263 that's it that's a choice whether we like it or whether we don't Acts 20 says for I know this that after my departure Grievous wolves come in and change the doctrines all right if you go to your churches and you ask them why do we keep Sunday then there is a Scurry and a\n\n(55:23) flurry and then there will be some scriptural evidence brought forward although all the authoritative writers have said there is no scriptural Authority for the transfer yet they will tell you there are texts in the Bible which said that they worshiped on the first day of the week and therefore we worship on the first day of the week or\n\n(55:43) they will say that Jesus abolished the Sabbath and nailed it to the cross and we no longer keep it therefore let no one judge you as to a Sabbath day quoting Colossians and all those texts or they will say to you how do we know what the Sabbath is you know there's been so much time and then it really\n\n(55:59) doesn't matter observe any day what day did God say You must observe the sabbath day imagine you have a randev view with your loved one that you haven't seen for a long time and she says Wednesday morning 7:00 I arrive please pick me up at the station and you think okay that's all right I love her I'll go on\n\n(56:24) Thursday do you think she'll be happy kind of doubt I kind of doubt it all right thank you the first day of the week let's have a look at these texts that are used to substantiate Sunday observance the first text we find in Matthew 28:1 it says there are eight texts about the first day of the week that are used the first one says in the\n\n(56:47) end of the Sabbath it became began to Dawn towards the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the seure and that's it is there anything anything about a change of the Sabbath yes or no it's a purely historic statement the new English Bible says the Sabbath had passed and it was Daybreak\n\n(57:05) on Sunday when Mary so and so and so and so so it's a purely factual statement there's nothing in it all right we can discard it Luke 23: 5456 by the way tells us that these women they kept the Sabbath they prepared spices anointments and rested on the Sabbath day according to the Commandment so they knew nothing\n\n(57:26) about a change when these women came on the first day it's because they didn't go on the Sabbath day because they rested according to the Commandment all right the second text we find in Mark 161 and 2 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salomi had brought\n\n(57:44) spices that they might come and anoint them very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the seure at the rising of the sun anything about a change there not a word all right third text Mark 69 when Jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast\n\n(58:02) Seven Devils anything there about a change or is it just a statement of fact statement of fact nothing there about a change we can discard that one fourth text now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came to the seure bringing the spices so that's in Luke it's the other gospel he repeats\n\n(58:19) the story anything about a change nothing so we can discard that one we only got four left that we have deal with fifth one John 20:1 the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark until the seure and seeth the stone taken away from the seure anything there nothing that leaves us with\n\n(58:40) three six TS John 20: 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and says unto them peace be unto you this one is used quite often aha the disciples came together on the first day\n\n(59:00) of the week they were worshiping doesn't say so it says they came together on the first day of the week for what fear of the Jews you see on the Sabbath they knew they were relatively safe because no Jew would do anything he would think he would be breaking the Sabbath but when the Sabbath was over they were quaking\n\n(59:19) in their boots so it says nothing about worship that leaves two texts two texts and these are the hot ones acts 20:7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the tomorrow and continued his speech until midnight now the new English Bible says on Saturday\n\n(59:47) night they came together ah they say well here's the text which says that they worshiped on the Sabbath day and they had communion they broke bread now let's Analyze This SE text carefully on the first day of the week they came together to break bread when does the first day start at the end of the Sabbath what time of day was that it was\n\n(1:00:13) in the evening so they came together when the first day of the week came it was evening and they came to break bread all right so that's one text we have to look at they came to break bread said but Paul preached to them ready to depart on the tomorrow so when the light should Dawn it would still be which day\n\n(1:00:34) Sunday Sunday the first day and he was going to go a long long way and he talked to them until midnight poor old uus was sitting there in the window and Paul was probably going on and on fell out the window remember the story and a Paul had to rush down and over him and he got up so this was not a Sunday morning meeting this was a\n\n(1:01:02) evening meeting but it wasn't held on the Sabbath because the Sabbath was holy they came together after the Sabbath Paul had a lot to tell them and if Sunday was so holy why was Paul going to March the next day many many kilometers on the so-called holy Sunday no no no so we only have one thing still to deal\n\n(1:01:24) with the breaking of the bread let's make sure that it was in the evening we read further in Acts 28 And1 there were many lights in the upper chambers where they were gathered together so it was dark right and it couldn't have been Sunday evening because that would have been the second day of the week so they\n\n(1:01:42) came together after the Sabbath when he therefore came up again and had broken bread and eaten he talked a long while even till break of day so he departed so even stayed longer and talked and then when it was Daylight off he went so it wasn't the holy day for him at all he was going to go away and that's the only\n\n(1:02:03) time we had with a meeting for them now as for the other bit the breaking of the bread Acts 2:46 says and they continued what's it say they daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house did they eat their meat with gladness of heart so they didn't have a communion they had meal supper together\n\n(1:02:24) that's what it was so we have one one text left one text left so in fact this text this pre one previous one supports the sanctity of the Sabbath cuz only after the Sabbath did they get together to discuss issues and then off they went eight St one Corinthians 161 and 2 now concerning the collection for the Saints\n\n(1:02:47) ah yes they held Church collection as I have given order to the churches of galatia even so you do upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store by way by the way the wioth translation brings it out nicely it says lay by at home as God has prospered him that there be no Gathering when I come so the\n\n(1:03:15) critics will say well they held a collection during the service in church no no no the text refers to a putting aside of the money on the first day of the week at home now let's think about that in the old days like with many people that still work today that earn their M money on a weekly basis when is\n\n(1:03:38) Payday on a weekly basis Friday Friday you get your pay the work is over you get your pay now you take your money and you take it home but in the mindset of the Hebrew Friday is the preparation you're getting ready for for the Sabbath Paul says put your money aside when on the first day of the week first day of the week the logical thing\n\n(1:04:04) is to work it all out put aside your your offering and your tithe and whatever you want to put aside Paul says no don't do it on the Friday when you get your money the Sabbath is coming the Sabbath is Holy do it early on the first day of the week after the Sabbath so when the Sabbath is over after Sunday\n\n(1:04:24) you go and sit down put aside your money so you don't use it during the next week and then keep it there until it can be collected so does it help Sunday worship or does it help Sabbath worship this text it's actually for Sabbath worship the Sabbath is so holy do it on the first day of the week so none of those\n\n(1:04:45) texts did it so did Jesus change the Sabbath Luke 4:16 and he came to Nazareth where had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read so Jesus kept the Sabbath Jesus said not one jot or one ttle would be removed from the law Matthew 5:17 to19 Jesus didn't change the Sabbath for\n\n(1:05:07) even here unto we are called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow him and we should walk even as he walked 1 John 2:6 so Jesus kept the Sabbath there's no evidence of a change of a Sabbath so where's the evidence Malachi 36 I am the Lord I change not Jesus didn't change\n\n(1:05:29) Psalms 894 my Covenant will I not break nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips God doesn't change Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 who changed it Catholic Church not Jesus if you love me then keep my Commandments if you love them keep their Commandments if you keep my\n\n(1:05:52) Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love and he said I know him and he that says I know him and keeps not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him that's strong words 1 John 2:4 that's it you either obey God or you don't for this is the love of God that\n\n(1:06:15) we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous 1 John 5:3 whosoever says that he lives in God should live just as Jesus Christ did he kept the Sabbath Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example if you love me keep my Commandments that's the example well the Christian world will\n\n(1:06:40) say the cross changed the Sabbath no it didn't let's have a look that day was the preparation that was Friday the word preparation is just used for that Friday preparing for the Sabbath Luke 23:54 and the women also which came Galilee followed beheld the seure and lay down his body you remember that story and\n\n(1:07:02) they returned prepare spice's ointment rested on the Sabbath there's no change here whatsoever according to the Commandment Luke and they found the stone ra rolled away again on the first day so the three days of the crucifixion you have the preparation that was Friday you have the Sabbath Jesus rested in the\n\n(1:07:23) grave they rested in on that day the the disciples and the women and on the first day things started up again no change no change so neither the the death nor the resurrection changes it can we really be sure which is the Sabbath day well what about that one let's have a look what astronomy teaches us Washington DC your letter 25 February\n\n(1:07:51) we had occasion to investigate the results of the work of specialists synchronology and we have never found one of them that has ever had the slightest doubt about the continuity of the weekly cycle since the beginning of the Christian era and that is US Naval Observatory Washington DC let's have a look at this people say we might have\n\n(1:08:12) lost the Sabbath well the Sabbath was instituted there in creation if we lost it then it was reestablished at the Mana because every week the Lord made made a special Miracle on that day the Mana lasted two days every other day it lasted one day so the saas if it should have been lost was reinstated over there\n\n(1:08:38) if it was lost thereafter it was reinstated at Mount Si then if we come to 46 BC that's where the Justinian the Julian calendar at least was instituted so we have absolute continuity from from then onwards and the cross Falls in there and we've just read Jesus kept the Sabbath the disciples kept the Sabbath\n\n(1:09:03) and that falls in the Julian calendar there's no loss over there then in 1582 there's a change of the calendar and we move to the Gregorian calendar oh that's exciting I like that because the Gregorian calendar refers to whomp to Pope Gregory and Pope Gregory saw fit to change the times why cuz there was something\n\n(1:09:31) bothering him but by the way it didn't move the Sabbath at all we went in October to 1 2 3 4 15 October so we jumped a couple of days there but the weekly cycle was not affected at all so the Sabbath is intact it has never been lost by the way why did the Pope want to move the calendar those days what bothered him why did he change\n\n(1:10:05) the times I'll tell you what bothered him it bothered him that the Pas the Christian Pash was not 100% in line with the Pagan Feast of ishta which we still call Easter to this day and he wanted to shift the calendar those few days so that the world should keep all the Pagan feasts rather than recognize what it is in the Bible did\n\n(1:10:39) you know that there was War as a consequence the British decided no way are we going along with this there was War as a consequence but it was forced upon them because we will keep the Pagan f festivals we will not obey the Bible these people are very arrogant so no day is lost the date shifts from the 4th to\n\n(1:11:06) the 15th but the weekly cycle is intact which day are the Jews keeping today Saturday Saturday same as always Matthew 24:20 pray that your flight be not in the winter nor on the Sabbath day Jesus is saying 70 AD when they come to destroy this place pray that the Sabbath day will not be the day when you have to\n\n(1:11:28) flee so he foresaw the Sabbath still being in existence then one last text shake your heads go wake up what about Colossians 2:6 wow this one is used every time let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of any holy day or the new moon or the Sabbath days that's the king King James version let no one\n\n(1:11:57) judge you regard to the Sabbath days now Sabbath days refers to the ceremonial Sabbath days the Sabbath day refers to the seven week or the 7 day week Sabbath let no one therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day that's the American Standard Version all right\n\n(1:12:28) which of the Ten Commandments deals with eating and drinking and new moons and all of those any of them so which laws deal with eatings and drinking and new moons and things like that ceremon the ceremonial laws blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out\n\n(1:12:57) of the way nailing it to the Cross let no man therefore judge you so they say Jesus nailed the Sabbath to the Cross no Jesus never nailed the Sabbath to the Cross he nailed two things to the cross the whole of the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross because Jesus became the Fulfillment of the law and the\n\n(1:13:19) condemnation of the law was nailed to the cross but not the law it itself how do I know because it says over there that these laws this handwriting of ordinances which was against us and only the writings of Moses the ceremonial law were to be written in a book placed beside the ark as a witness says the Old Testament\n\n(1:13:47) against us so these were a shadow of things to come but the body the substance of them is Christ Colossians 2:17 so let's quickly recap the weekly Sabbath was instituted in Eden right okay and it points back to Creation it existed before sin there it is it points to Creation hallow my Sabbath keep the Sabbath for in six days\n\n(1:14:17) the Lord made the heavens the Earth the Sea and the Springs of water it reminds us of where we come from The Shadow sabbaths in other words the Feast of unle bread uh the Passover the Feast of the wave offering the first fruits all of those special sabbaths they could fall on any day but they pointed to the\n\n(1:14:38) ministry of Christ they point forward to Christ so the ceremonial Sabbath linked the sanctuary service the shadow service and pointed forway forward to Redemption so when Colossians says the the Sabbath was a shadow of things to come who did it point to Christ the substance thereof being Christ so when Christ died he nailed the\n\n(1:15:07) ceremonial law to the Cross we don't have to keep special sabbaths anymore we don't have to follow the rituals of the Passover which have to do with eating and drinking and how much of the Passover you were supposed to have and all those issues it deals with ceremonies but the Sabbath deals with creation and the ten\n\n(1:15:32) commandments so those are the only texts that are used against the Sabbath the disciples did they change the Sabbath Paul as his man as was went into them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures talking to the Jews and then it says and he reasoned in the Sabbath with the Jews\n\n(1:15:55) and the Greeks and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words may be preached to them the next Sabbath and the next Sabbath day almost the whole city came together we read that in Acts chap 1342 and 44 so Paul and the disciples preached on a Sabbath they kept the Sabbath whether they were\n\n(1:16:18) talking to Jews or whether they were talking to Gentiles so this is the bottom line here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep God's Commandments how many of them all 10 and the faith of Jesus Revelation 1412 I will put my laws into their minds and write them in my hearts that's quoting Hebrews 8:10 that's the New\n\n(1:16:45) Covenant the New Covenant is taking the Law of God putting it into the heart into the mind onto the hand into the forehead act accordingly think accordingly obey God the Catholic Church says no by my Divine Authority you will obey me and not them but the Bible says Revelation 2214 and this is New Testament blessed are they\n\n(1:17:14) that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the Tree of Life aha obedience is going to be a test and may enter in through the gates into the City and then if you are obedient we according to his promise look for a new Heaven and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 Peter 313 nobody now has the mark of the beast\n\n(1:17:46) nobody now has it when that law is enforced and it's coming because the pope has asked for it and don't think Islamic countries or judaic countries will be excluded the pope has asked for it and they will keep it when that law comes then the decision will be made and you choose either the one with the\n\n(1:18:08) cauliflower ears and the buck teeth or you choose the Lord one of the two the Bible says for as the new heavens and the new Earth which I shall make shall remain before me says the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh\n\n(1:18:31) come to worship before me says the Lord Isaiah 66: 22:23 this is the new world will the Sabbath be kept in the new world yes or no yes what is this new moon thing doing over here the new moon from one new moon to another so on a monthly basis isn't the new Moon Festival a ceremonial law is that going to be kept well there's\n\n(1:18:54) something that will be kept on a monthly basis in heaven as well because the Bible says that the Tree of Life bore its fruits how many times once mon once a month so I have news for you oh yeah and the Bible says it bore how many manner of fruits 12 kinds of fruits and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the\n\n(1:19:21) Nations wow so let's Imagine This the tree of life will bear its fruit once a month and we will go and we will partake of the Tree of Life once a month the leaves maybe we make some tea the most delightful tea caffeine free of course from the tree of life it's going to be a feast folks and from one Sabbath to another\n\n(1:19:50) shall All Flesh come before the Lord and the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever Psalms 37:29 I have condemned no one tonight no individual I have not said anyone is lost who is keeping Sunday out of faithfulness of their hearts at the moment I've said none such thing I have just said there is a system on this\n\n(1:20:12) Earth that lays claim to the fact that it stands above God that it is higher than God and that it has Authority in your life over and above the authority of God and that very soon this test will come to a point when this Authority will be tested and your Allegiance will be on the line and you will be asked to choose the one or to\n\n(1:20:38) choose the other if you choose the one you choose the Beast and you obtain its Mark if you choose the other then you will obtain the Mark or the Seal of God and you will be sealed for God that's what it is obedience does not lie in the day alone because the Sabbath stands for how much of the law all of it because\n\n(1:21:02) the authority of the law is based on the seal so the Sabbath is merely the authentication of the whole law we must develop Christlike characters we must allow the Lord to change us we must have a relationship with the Lord by keeping the law no one's going to be saved by having a relationship with God we can be\n\n(1:21:27) saved and will be saved but if we have the right relationship with God we will also keep his law that's the bottom line I hope that this issue is clear tomorrow night we're going to deal with the beasts of Revelation 13 and particularly the people of this nation should be here it's thunderous stuff don't miss it thank you for coming\n\n(1:22:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] oh a [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:217_the_crime_of_all_ages_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nThe Sabbath,God's Authority,Mark of the Beast,Sunday Observance,Biblical Interpretation\n\n## Guide:\nThis source delves into the biblical understanding of the Sabbath and its significance as a mark of God's authority and creation. It meticulously distinguishes the true Sabbath, Saturday, from Sunday observance, which is presented as a tradition initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. The speaker argues that the Catholic Church, in its assertion of power, intentionally changed times and laws by shifting the day of worship, thereby challenging God's authority. This change is depicted as a \"mark of the Beast,\" contrasting it with God's \"mark\" of the Sabbath, which represents allegiance to the Creator and obedience to His complete law. The text concludes by asserting that a future test of loyalty will emerge when individuals are forced to choose between God's Sabbath and man's tradition.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 217 - The Crime of All Ages _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSMsTSuUdCM\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the crime of the Antichrist now we've dealt with some of these issues already yesterday but perhaps we just want to put one or two things into perspective and see where we're heading before I do that what is a beast in the Bible govern it's a political entity now we find the\n\n(01:23) beast in Revelation as well and uh we find that beast in Revelation 13 and it rises up out of the sea amongst the Nations and then it has all the attributes of the little horn all the attributes of the little horn and we'll deal with that prophecy in detail I think it is tomorrow night tomorrow night and somebody asked me earlier is\n\n(01:50) America in Prophecy well come and listen tomorrow night and let's have a look what the Bible says and then you decide for yourself if it's in there or whether it's not in there I mean this is this is a thunderous time that we're living in now you know if something Walks Like A Duck and it looks like a duck and it\n\n(02:11) quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck right so if if something has exactly the same attributes as the little horn in Daniel chapter 7 then what is the probability that it is the little horn in Daniel chapter 7 pretty good right okay so this power we'll be dealing with tomorrow night and there is just so much\n\n(02:35) to deal with you cannot open it up all in one evening but uh let's have a look at this little horn power and look at some of the aspects of what it did the little horn power in Daniel 7:25 we saw last night would think to change times and laws of course he says that he can change times and laws he can change\n\n(02:59) change the times he can change God's law but in actual fact he only presumes to he is presumptuous nobody can change God's law and get away with it would you agree remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the of the Lord thy God and that you shall\n\n(03:28) not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maid servant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for there's a reason in six days God made the heavens and the earth now what is the evolution Theory to that text was it in the waste paper basket how many lectures did we spend here\n\n(03:51) saying that you cannot throw that text into the waste paper basket was it full I think so you cannot throw that in the waste paper basket now why so much effort to throw that piece in the waste paper basket because if that piece is not in the waste paper basket then you're in trouble with this one the sea and all that in them is and\n\n(04:15) he rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it Exodus 28 to1 that means he set it aside for Holy use now Man was created male and female representing communication on the horizontal level he Wass to be Confederate but without God in the equation you have what you have today\n\n(04:47) total chaos not only in marriage but in general you have to have God in the equation this is quite an interesting story when I first came into contact with God I was actually quite jealous of him because he requires first place and I was married to my wife and she was all mine and now I had to share her that was\n\n(05:16) tough I I I walked around with a lip this long for quite a while while I was muding this over maybe I'm just a bit weird but I was thinking about these things now eventually when I started realizing the character of God and his total selfishness if someone is 100% selfless like Jesus was he poured himself out for\n\n(05:41) mankind if he's 100% selfish then how much are you going to get out of the deal if you are dealing with such an individual you're going to get 100% And that's the beauty of it you see if you love God supremely you get get God's love supremely unselfishly poured out upon you and the blessing becomes so great that the\n\n(06:09) relationship between a man and a woman gets increased in relationship Glory whatever you want to call it millions of times it gets enhanced because God is in the equation in fact God can set so many of our self rituals straight how many people are linked to each other by selfish ties that the one may not do this or that or the other\n\n(06:41) because the other one restrains him now if you have the spirit of God in you you become selfless and your whole view changes and you want to make the other one more happy by giving more and more freedom and of course that is dangerous in the eyes of the world because Freedom means you can do what you want to so\n\n(07:04) it's a question of choice so if you're making your choices within the Realms of what God has defined is right and good then the relationship can blossom it's absolutely amazing so here God says that you must keep the Sabbath day for in six days the Lord made the heavens the Earth the sea and all that is in them but is\n\n(07:26) he's the Creator he's the one that brought what it all about and he rested on the seventh day he rested was God tired no no God wasn't tired so what is this rest that he found in his relationship with man he rested because in man he found the Fulfillment of his whole plan for the entire universe his whole plan in man\n\n(07:58) was to be made manifest the glory of God he created man for his own Glory says the Bible in other words man was to reflect to the universe the glory and the wisdom of God it's a noble noble purpose tremendous thoughts so here God looked at this new creation of his and he found rest in it it's it's like when\n\n(08:26) you have a new relationship you met this woman of your dreams or if you are of the opposite sex this man of your dreams and you've been separated for a while and now you come together again for the first time and you look at each other and you hold each other and you have nothing to say except rest to find rest in the\n\n(08:56) relationship does that make any sense so goded he found peace in the relationship even though he knew that war was going to break out all around him as a consequence because the devil was angry when he created man he was angry but God found rest in man and man can find rest in God in spite of what's going on\n\n(09:24) around us so he rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it do you know that two lovers that really love each other can find rest in each other even if the whole world is going up in smoke around them did you know that absolutely so we can only find rest in God so God\n\n(09:48) took this sabbath day and set it aside for a holy purpose he said to man you go and have dominion you go and do whatever you want to do you place the world under you put it into subjection change it modify it do whatever you like but once a week let's come and have Holy Communion together we will talk every\n\n(10:11) day we will walk together every day we will commune every day but let's set a day aside that's what it is all about Exodus 20111 for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth the sea and all the in them and he rested and the Hebrew word used there is is nah whereas previously it was Shabbat the seventh day wherefore the\n\n(10:37) Lord blessed the Sabbath day and he hallowed it and this if you look it up in the Strong's Concordance means to rest to settle down it means to be Confederate it's like I've been explaining to be together to have this feeling that wow this is great we Belong Together moreover also I gave them my sabbaths to\n\n(11:06) be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that sanctify them this holy relationship this capacity to do what is right this will to do what is Right comes from God and so the lord gave the Sabbath as a sign between them that they may know that he the Lord is the one that sanctifies them ex Ezekiel 20:2 and 20\n\n(11:39) so here's another parallel text and hallow my sabbaths hallow them and they shall be a sign between me and you that you may know that I am the Lord your God this is weird is it possible that somebody else could be the Lord your God yes or no yes it is well many people the ancient folks even the Israelites\n\n(12:03) constantly strayed and bowed down to another deity whoever he was whether he was M or whether he was Bal or whether he was whatever or they worshiped Ash the Queen of Heaven all these strange deities God says no no no listen here I make a packed with you hallow my Sabbath and it shall be a sign between me and\n\n(12:28) you that you may know that I am the Lord your God it's like a test it's like a test Exodus 31 verse 13 speak thou also unto the children of Israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your Generations that you may know that I am the Lord that does sanctify you not\n\n(12:55) another I am the one Exodus 31:6 wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generation for a Perpetual Covenant for a Perpetual Covenant now let's have a look at this sign it is a sign Hebrews the word there is oath between me and the children of Israel\n\n(13:22) forever why for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the Earth and rested on the seventh day and he was refreshed very interesting verse this so it is a sign and why because God is your creator he's your owner he says there choose me I am the one who made you all the others didn't make you they're just\n\n(13:48) stealing you and offering you nothing in return but death so it is a sign and God was refreshed now what does that word sign mean well if you look up the Hebrew again and it says it is a token it is an endine it is a miracle if you like and it is a mark it is a standard is a mark a signal a distinguishing mark\n\n(14:13) That's the strong concordance definition of the word so does God have a mark yes what is it sabath it's a Sabbath God has a mark does the Beast have a mark yeah that's called The Mark of the Beast I wonder what that is is it a computer in Brussel is it a barcode that will be chapped onto your hand is it something\n\n(14:39) that you find on a can of beans if you look at the bottom is God interested in lines on the can of beans or is he interested in your character and in Your Allegiance what is he interested in in your character and in Your Allegiance so let's have a look at this very carefully all right so we we' now established that\n\n(15:00) God has a mark a sign and it is the Sabbath so it is a Mark or a sign between me and the children of Israel forever for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth and the seventh day he rested and he was refreshed so we must understand God's Mark he sign or a seal these are synonyms let's have a look at the Seal\n\n(15:28) of the United States seeing that we are in the United States a seal authenticates a document this is the Seal of the president of the United States of America and this was a typical Royal seal this was the Seal of George II Regent King of England note the three elements it gives his name George the 6\n\n(15:53) and it gives his title which is King and it gives his territory which is great Britain and the dominions so a typical seal has all those components the title and it has the name and it has the territory and without it a law would be useless it would have no Authority now the decalog is a law it is the law of\n\n(16:22) God now this whole law has its Authority only because it has a seal in it God's seal is in the heart of God's law let's listen to this carefully all the other Commandments are just Commandments Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that thou shalt not have another God besides me Thou shalt\n\n(16:49) not use the name in vain honor your parents and your and you will have a long life Etc but here there's something special remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shall your labor and do all your work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God for in six days the Lord there's the name that's\n\n(17:08) yve that's God's name we have name he made the heavens and the Earth so that is the title he's the Creator and what is the Dominion Heaven Earth sea all that is in them so there you have the Dominion all the elements are there and without the Sabbath the law would have no authenticity it would be just another\n\n(17:37) document but now it has the stamp of God yve your creator Dominion Heaven Earth sea everything every nation everything that was ever created it's under my Dominion now if the United States makes a law a new law and proclaims a new law then that law must be signed by whom before it comes into effect the\n\n(18:05) president the president must sign it and if the president doesn't sign it the law is not valid is that right all right now imagine I always use a parable to explain this imagine we place ourselves back sometime there in the times of Germany and Adolf Hitler comes to power and he so impressed with his power he wants to\n\n(18:31) make sure that there is no opposition so he proclaims a law it's just a hypothetical story it's a nonsense story but it's just there to illustrate a point he proclaims a law and he says next Wednesday 12:00 I want the German people to come onto the streets and Proclaim their solidarity for Me by One Voice shouting\n\n(18:59) H Hitler on that particular day on Wednesday at whatever time 12:00 1:00 let's say 12:00 everybody has to do it and the gapo is out and the military police is out and the parades are full how many of the German people would have appeared on the street that day just about everybody and there they go and when the clock strikes they all\n\n(19:26) show their solidarity now I was so impressed with that that I make a law and I said no no no no next Thursday at 12:00 everybody has to come onto the street and Shout H Walter fight send that out to everyone in Germany next Thursday comes around how many people appear on the streets not one single sausage that's not fair why not why'\n\n(19:57) they do it for that boo not for me what's the difference I don't have the authority I don't have the title I don't have the jurisdiction does that make sense so his counts mine counts for nothing mine counts for nothing I had the same law but it means nothing Well adov Hitler got so excited when he got such a\n\n(20:21) positive response it never happened by the way but he decides to write the same law and he sends it let's say to Russia and says next Wednesday 12:00 I want the Russian people on the roads and shouting the same thing how many Russians would appear on the streets not one maybe they would appear to mock him what's the difference why\n\n(20:44) did it work in Germany and not in [Music] Russia he didn't have the jurisdiction he might have had a title and he might have had all those things but he didn't have the jurisdiction so here we have all of these in one shot the Lord that's his name we have the jurisdiction we have the title The Creator and we have\n\n(21:04) the jurisdiction which includes everything on Earth and in heaven so everybody has to obey him this makes the law authentic and gives power to the whole of the law without the Sabbath without that signature the whole law becomes just another document with rules not saying where it comes from not saying who has has the authority so the\n\n(21:30) Lord the Creator heaven and earth that is what authenticates the whole law everybody understand that without it the law is not authenticated so this seal contains his name his title and his territory moreover I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that Sanctified\n\n(21:52) them so now how do I show God that I am willing to obey him do I put up a big banner do I wear a certain dress do I put a certain hat on my head do I do whatever or do I just obey him and keep that day because he said so isn't that the greatest sign of all if you just do it because he said so wow that's fantastic now what if\n\n(22:23) somebody else comes along and says now hang on a second hang on a a second what's going on here who do you think you are obeying that precept and giving your allegiance to that power I'm telling you I don't want you to obey them I want you to obey me and I'm telling you let's change this let's check who has\n\n(22:46) Authority in your life is it God or is it me and I'm telling you you better obey me rather than God would you have a problem yeah sure you have a problem I always use another Parable par Parable I always tell the story of let's say for example again this is totally hypothetical right it's a nice Parable I\n\n(23:11) always use it and everybody always misunderstands it and they think it's really true but it's not true it's just a parable assume I'm married to my wife many years and I have children and then one day some other Bozo comes along is that an acceptable word in this country I don't know he comes along and he gets my wife to\n\n(23:34) follow him and she leaves me and moves in with this other guy marries him and takes the kids with him now I'm devastated devastated there she is with this other guy and why she wants to choose this guy with the cauliflower ears and the buck teeth in the first place I don't know but she's off with him and she's left me and now I had\n\n(23:57) certain rules in my house let's say the kids have to be in bed at a certain time or they have to do their homework or they have to help in the house and they're not allowed to watch bad stuff on television and if they go out they have to be back at a reasonable time stuff like that normal stuff and this new guy says to the kids\n\n(24:16) when they move in listen in this house I The Authority in your lives as far as this house is concerned and I want you to keep your you know live tidily and help in the house and not to be too late when you come home and and uh you know all the good things that I had as well would I have a problem with any of those\n\n(24:34) rules that he made yes or no no I would have no problem with them whatsoever but then he has one extra Rule and he says to my kids listen I have one extra rule your dad has had authority over you in the past your dad had authority over you in the past but that is over I am the new Authority in your life and you will\n\n(25:02) obey me and the kids say hang on a second we have visitation times with my dad on certain days he only has that particular day which he specified CU it's the right one or whatever and this guy says no way you will listen to me no longer to your dad would I have a problem with that rule yeah I probably go around and\n\n(25:26) modify his nose by turning it around 360Â° right now why does that rule irritate me because it affects my authority Nobody messes with my authority when it comes to my kids they're my kids too they're my kids too now God feels the same way we are his kids and another power comes along and says I don't care about these other\n\n(25:50) rules but this particular one the one that tests Authority you will obey me and not God hey God says I'll turn your nose around 360Â° whether you like it or not and he will and he will it's going to happen so God says I gave them my Sabbath to be a sign between me and them that they may know that I am the Lord that sanctifies\n\n(26:12) them Isaiah 58:13 says if you turn away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight I'm not talking about the way the Jews kept the Sabbath a ritual where you do this and you're not allowed to do that you're not allowed to eat egg that was laid on the Sabbath and you're not\n\n(26:31) allowed to do this that and the other walk so many yards or whatever no no no no that's a burden it says here he call the Sabbath a delight not the burden the holy of the Lord honorable and shall honor him and not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words then shalt\n\n(26:52) thou Delight thyselves in the Lord and I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the of the Earth and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it he says if you honor my authority in your life and you spend it with me and you allow me to sanctify you you will\n\n(27:13) you will be happy and you will have the heritage of Jacob which is eternal life and what about the strangers did it apply only to the Jews this sabbath day Isaiah 566 and 7 all the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the Lord to serve him and to love the name of the Lord to be his servants everyone\n\n(27:35) that keeps the Sabbath the Sabbath became the sign of your allegiance to the deity called yve it was the sign even them will I bring to my Holy Mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer for mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people so if a stranger came did he have to accept the Sabbath yes or\n\n(28:00) no yes sure he had to accept the Sabbath Deuteronomy 11:13 to20 and it will be for you if you will listen carefully to my Commandments which I command you today take heed to yourselves that your heart may not be deceived the Commandments are the law they're riched you cannot change them and you turn aside and serve other gods\n\n(28:24) and worship them so is there a possibility that this conflict could arise yes or no certainly could therefore now listen carefully you shall lay up these my words in your hearts talking about the Commandments of God and in your souls and bind them for a sign upon your hand listen carefully now on your hand so that they may may be as\n\n(28:52) frontlets between your eyes so where must the Commandments of God God be placed on your hand and in your forehead wow is there a mark of a beast that must be placed on the hand or the for yes or no oh but the Commandments of God must be on your hand on your forehead now the Jews were very clever they wrote out the\n\n(29:19) Ten Commandments on a little plaque and stuck them on the hand and stuck them on the front and they all the deed was done I've got the law in my hand I've got the law in my Forest big deal do you think what God had in mind that would be so silly it would be unbelievable God never had that in mind what did he have in mind when he said\n\n(29:41) that he said tie them to your hand act accordingly put them in there think accordingly doesn't that make sense it's got nothing to do with an outward sign God is not silly and and these words which I command you this day shall be in your heart that's where he wanted them I wonder whether they cut it open over\n\n(30:05) here and put the plaque inside there as well no they didn't and you shall carefully teach them to your sons and you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes here in your cognitive thinking this is God's law I will keep God's law he is my God I will follow him that's what it\n\n(30:29) says continue in Exodus 13:9 it shall be a sign unto them upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the Lord's law may be in thy mouth it's pretty clear what must be on the forehead and on the hand the law of God it's got nothing to do with a barcode from a can of beans or whatever it's got to do with the law of God that\n\n(30:57) has to be on your hand hand and that has to be in your forehead now what about that other guy with a cauliflower ears and the buck teeth who takes away the followers of God actually he doesn't have cauliflower ears and buck teeth he's actually quite handsome it's quite irritating but in any case takes them\n\n(31:16) away and misleads them misleads them and he says no no no no my sign my mark on your forehead or your hand well let's have a look what was the purpose then of the Sabbath it was a day of rest it was a day of blessing it was a day of peace it was a sign it was a memorial to Creation it was a symbol of\n\n(31:46) sanctification it was a hallowed day and it was a Perpetual Covenant that was what there was and remember Mark 2:27 the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath that doesn't get rid of the Sabbath it just tells you that man needs the Sabbath man needs this communication with his God and he\n\n(32:11) must know who his God is the god that we serve is the god of the Sabbath that's the god whom we serve otherwise who is he is it the one of the Friday is it the one of the Sunday is it the one of the Wednesday is it a god of the Hindus is it the one the Buddhists is it the one of the shintu is it this one is it that\n\n(32:31) one I'll tell you what it's the god of the Sabbath simple as that that's what the Bible says oh that thou hearkened unto my Commandments then th had peace then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea Isaiah 48:18 you would know exactly where you stand or where you are\n\n(32:50) Deuteronomy 5:29 oh that there was such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my Commandments nine of them them or all of them all my Commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children forever well having established that then why do we keep Sunday why don't we keep the Sabbath why\n\n(33:16) does the Christian World keep Sunday Sunday let's ask Webster's International dictionary what it means some of the new diction dictionaries get quite sneaky you got to watch it in the old days they used to define it like this so-called because this day was anciently dedicated to the Sun or its worship Chef's encyclopedia says Sunday\n\n(33:40) dear Solace of the Roman Calendar day of the sun being dedicated to the Sun the first day of the week most Oxford dictionaries will say Sunday first day of the week New Oxford dictionaries will say Sunday day following Saturday to day that's pathetic that's not a definition anymore that's a definition in terms of\n\n(34:03) another definition doesn't mean anything anymore but there you have it that's what it is it's the day of the sun it's dear Solace of the Roman Canada the day of the Sun and it's the first day of the week it's not the seventh day of the week Sabbath a Hebrew word signifying rest Sunday was a name given by the\n\n(34:25) heathens to the first day of the week because it was the the day on which they worship the son John EDD a Bible cyclopedia page 561 you can check it out I mean it's all there the reference are there take your ordinary dictionary at home and see what that says so the Sabbath is not Sunday it's Saturday\n\n(34:45) Sunday is the first day of the week but the Christian World Keeps Sunday let's have a look at a at a photocopy if you like a photograph of a of a dictionary 7th day Saturday the seventh day of the week Saturday the seventh day of the week Daniel 7:25 remember said and he the little horn who identified him last\n\n(35:13) night shall speak words against the most high shall work wear out the Saints of the most high and plot to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time times and a half a time now re ration 13:7 talks about this Beast that has all the attributes of the little horn and we've already said if it\n\n(35:36) looks like a duck and Walks Like A Duck and quacks like a duck then it's probably a duck so this Beast is exactly the same power as the little horn power and we are told that this Beast will Implement with the aid of another Power which we will deal with tomorrow night the mark of this Beast now we've already\n\n(35:57) established what what God's Mark was what was it the Sabbath and where was it to be written on the forward and on the hand now it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and the power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations Revelation 13:7 and he causes all both small and\n\n(36:21) great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forests and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name fascinating text fascinating text we will deal with this in detail and take it apart every aspect of that text\n\n(36:48) we will open up one little difference between God's Mark and the Beast marks and it's just a tiny little difference it lies over here it says all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads Gods was to be in the right hand and in the forehead God\n\n(37:18) is not satisfied with halfway service All or nothing this Beast is happy if you have it in your forehead that is you think it's right and you act accordingly but he's also happy if you don't think it's right if you go along with it because you have no other choice so act accordingly because he said so then he's\n\n(37:40) also will leave you alone does that make sense as long as you obey him he doesn't care how whether you're convinced or not as long as you obey him wow and if you don't do it economic boycott you will not be able to buy yourselves we'll freeze your bank account will freeze it and save that you have this Mark or the name of the Beast\n\n(38:04) stands for its character or the number and we'll be dealing with that as well now let's have a look at the Roman decretal now this comes from a Roman Catholic Source deal translat episcope he the pope can pronounce sentences and judgments in contradictions to the rights of Nations to the law of God and\n\n(38:25) man he's a mighty man he's might ier than God or any Nation on Earth he can free himself from the commands of the Apostles he being their Superior and from the rules of the Old Testament he can do whatever he likes we read further the pope has the power to change times to abrogate laws and to dispense with all things even the\n\n(38:46) precepts of Christ so no matter what the old husband said I'm the new husband around here you won't listen to your previous dad you'll listen to me have we got this other the guy around yes or no yes we have him around there he is let's see what he says 2 Thessalonians 23:4 let no man deceive you by any means for\n\n(39:07) that day shall not come except they come a falling away first and that man of sin which is transgressing of the law will be revealed the son of pedition who opposes and exalteth himself above all that is called God he's the other guy and his days coming when his nose will be twisted 360 degrees not by me or\n\n(39:28) by any man but by God without human hands the Bible says Pope Nicholas quoted in facts for the time Pope the Pope's will stands for reason he can dispense Above the Law and of wrong make right by correcting and changing laws he's a powerful guy he can do whatever he likes ask the Catholic Church which is\n\n(39:53) the Sabbath day it says Saturday is the Sabbath day your dad said Keep Saturday but I'm telling you no visitation on that day then why do You observe Sunday instead of Saturday why because I'm the new Authority in your life and we observe Sunday instead of Saturday because we the Catholic Church transferred the solity from Saturday to\n\n(40:13) Sunday this is not just any Source this is the converts catechism of Catholic Doctrine 1957 that's pretty straight out of the horse's mouth this is the new boyfriend and he says you will not listen listen to your dad you'll listen to me because I said so so what is he attacking isn't he attacking the\n\n(40:35) authority of God you cannot attack the authority of God of God on the strength of any other commandment except the Sabbath you can only attack the authority of God on the strength of the Sabbath because that is what determines the authority so what is the mark of the beast then we have a beast we have a beast that say is you\n\n(40:57) will accept my mark and you'll have it on your hand or your forehead we have a seal of God which is a mark which says you will keep the Commandments of God on your hands and on your foreheads whoa we're coming to an impass there's no compromise here what does the Beast say what is its mark this is the Catholic\n\n(41:16) record September 1 1923 they say Sunday is our Mark of authority so what is the mark of the beast then what does it say it says Sunday the church is above the Bible wow I'm the new boyfriend you don't listen to the rules of your dad you listen to me and this transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact\n\n(41:46) Catholic record there they say it so we have two marks on this earth and the choice is ours either we obey God or we obey the new boyfriend that's it so Satan has attacked the Sabbath because it is the Seal of God it affects the authority of god let's have some more quotes Catholic World March 1894 she took the Pagan Sunday and made it\n\n(42:10) the Christian Sunday and thus the Pagan Sunday dedicated to balda that's Bal became the Christian Sunday sacred to Jesus interesting let's take another one Faith of Our Fathers Cardinal Gibbons of course of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act and the act and he reiterates it is a mark\n\n(42:34) of her ecclesiastical power she says she's mightier than God in this issue I don't care what laws God Made You will listen to me this is real arrogance the Bible says remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day the Catholic Church says no they're pretty straight who's this speaking oh it's father enrite writing\n\n(43:00) in the American Sentinel this is the Catholic Church spokesman he says the Bible says so but the Catholic Church says no by my divine power I abolish the Sabbath day and command you to keep holy the first day of the week and L the entire civilized World bows down in reverent obedience to the command of the\n\n(43:21) Holy Catholic Church isn't that arrogance beyond measure it is so arrogant freaks me out by my divine power well if that's their divine power then it must be a different divine power to God's divine power right or wrong there's another God on Earth who sets himself up in the temple of God claiming to be God so we have two that\n\n(43:48) we are serving of course the Catholic church is not really God it must have another Power behind it and the Bible says and the dragon gave him his seat and power and great Authority those are very sad words and I don't say them flippantly kismos Romanos pop pasas 1566 commanded by the Council of Trent it\n\n(44:14) pleased the Church of God that the religious celebration of the Sabbath day should be transferred to the Lord's day Sunday over and over they say I was in a spirit on the Lord's Day Revelation 1:10 they say well the Lord's day was Sunday it doesn't say so it says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day doesn't say\n\n(44:32) what day it was only the Bible can say which is the Lord's day and there it is Isaiah 58:13 if thou turn thy foot away from the Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath Delight the holy of the Lord so which is the Lord's Day according to the Bible the Sabbath not Sunday so I was in the spirit on the\n\n(44:54) Lord's day it doesn't really cut any ice what about this one therefore the son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath does that do away with the Sabbath or established who is in Authority when it comes to the Sabbath by the way who created this worldus was it the father or was it through the sun through the sun it was\n\n(45:15) through the sun you go and read John chapter 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God everything that was created on this world was created through him and for him by his word it stands so Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath Catholic Press Sydney August 25 19008 Sunday is a Catholic institution\n\n(45:42) and its claims to observance can be defended only on Catholic principles these are all Catholic quotes from the beginning to the end of scriptures there's not a single passage which warrant the transfer of the weekly public worship from the last day of the week to the first they are so straightforward on this you may read the\n\n(45:58) Bible from Genesis to Revelation and you will not find a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday the scriptures enforce the religious observing of Saturday James gardenal kibbons the Faith of Our Fathers the Catholic church is throwing out the gauntlet and saying there take it or leave it\n\n(46:18) choose the Christian Sabbath is to this day the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church a spouse of the Holy Ghost without a word of remonstrance from the pro Protestant World Catholic mirror September 23 so they say to the Protestants you say you're Protestants why you obey us then if you obey us then\n\n(46:35) you ours whether you like it or not they're so arrogant Chancellor of the arch dases of Baltimore reping for the Cardinal in a letter dated 19 uh February 10 1920 if Protestants would follow the Bible they should worship God on the Sabbath day in keeping the Sunday they are following a law of the Catholic\n\n(46:55) church this is the Catholic Church speaking John Gib Shay American Catholic quarterly review protestantism and discarding the authority of the Roman Church has no good reason for for its Sunday Theory and ought logically to keep Saturday as the Sabbath not the Creator this is really arrogant not the creator of the universe\n\n(47:19) in Genesis 21 and three but the Catholic church can claim the honor of having granted man a pause to work every seven days this is so arrogant it blows my mind those quotes I've never seen this is unbelievable and this one was made not in the Middle Ages this was made in 1969 reason and Common Sense demand and\n\n(47:45) this one should really clinch it re reason and Common Sense demand acceptance of one or the other of these Alternatives either protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday or catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday compromise is impossible there you go Catholic mirror December 23 1893 there's the battle line if you obey\n\n(48:14) God you keep which day Saturday if you obey the Catholic Church you keep Sunday that's what they're saying so if you're a Protestant but you're keeping Sunday you're really obeying whom the pope you're Bing the Pope that doesn't mean that Protestants out there who have never heard this information now have\n\n(48:34) the mark of the beast they don't because God is judging them according to the light that they have but this issue is going to become prominent very very soon because the present Pope the present Pope has asked for worldwide Sunday legislation and your president had said we want to implement his teachings\n\n(48:57) that's interesting I'll show it to you still I'll show it to you so now why do Protestants keep on keeping Sunday well what do they say do they know this or don't they know this yes they know it yes they know it let's have it run through them quickly the Episcopal say is there any commandment in the New Testament to change the day\n\n(49:17) of weekly rest from Saturday to Sunday none Manual of Christian doctrine that's well that's their their big writing we have made a change from Seventh Day to the first day from Saturday to Sunday on the authority of the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church of Christ why we keep Sunday that's the Episcopal Church\n\n(49:35) well they're so near to the Catholics it's you know it's just sort of a hiccup between them but they say they know but they keep Sunday all right what about the other Protestant groups the Lutheran Church we observe the Lord's day Sunday is founded or the observance of the Lord's day Sunday is founded not on any\n\n(49:56) command of God but on the authority of the church this is the alburg confession this is the central document for Lutheranism in the Catholic Sabbath manual part two section one they know it all right what about the Presbyterians a change of the day to be observed from the last day of the week to the first\n\n(50:15) there is no record no Express command authorizing the change this is the Christian shabath Sabbath NL rice one of their spokespersons fine what about the methodists take the matter of Sunday there's no passage telling Christians to keep that day or to transfer the Jewish sabbath to that day Christian Advocate July 2 1942\n\n(50:36) so the methodists know it well what's going on here what about the congregationalists it's quite clear that however rigidly or devoutly we spend Sunday we are not keeping the Sabbath there's not a single sentence in the New Testament to suggest that we incur any penal penalty by violating the supposed\n\n(50:52) sanctity of Sunday this is The Ten Commandments by Dr Dale all right that's the congregationalists is there anybody out there hello anglicans many people think that Sunday is the Sabbath but neither in the New Testament nor in the early church is there anything to suggest that we have any right to transfer the observance of\n\n(51:09) the seventh day of the week to the first the Sabbath was an East Saturday not Sunday reverent lion beer Church of the people there we go well what about the Baptists there was an EAS a commandment to keep holy the Sabbath day but that Sabbath was not Sunday there is no scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution\n\n(51:30) from the seventh day to the first day of the week is this anybody speaking oh no this is Hicks hiscox he's the author of the Baptist manual he should know so they all know every single one of them knows here's another one Reverend Philip car AR Bishop Quebec he sent them all in a Scurry saying outright that there was\n\n(51:49) nothing to support Sunday being kept Hing he definitely told the church meeting in this city of straight laac Protestant ISM that tradition not the Bible had made Sunday the day of worship Toronto Daily Star so tradition Pagan tradition introduced by Rome kept it now what does the Lord say about tradition let's read that almost\n\n(52:12) all churches throughout the world celebrate the sacred Mysteries the Lord's Supper on the Sabbath of every week yet the Christians are now know this of Alexandria and at Rome on account of some ancient tradition had have ceased to do this this is ecclesiastical history now Alexandria is the one where\n\n(52:32) all the Pagan doctrines were introduced this where the sades learned that there was no Resurrection but that when you go to heaven you go and sit on Abraham's lap and Jesus said hey what are you teaching there there's no such thing so Alexandria and Rome are the seat of paganism Alexandria taught ancient Egyptian Gnostic\n\n(52:58) Mysteries and based on cabalism and gnosticism ancient tradition well Catholic record says Sunday is founded not on scripture but on tradition and is a distinctly Catholic institution we will deal with that in some astounding detail what paganism has done and how occultism has controlled some of these decisions the\n\n(53:23) New Testament makes no explicit mention that the Apostle Chang the day of worship but we know it from tradition this is the revised Baltimore catechism so these are the authorative documents of the church it's all based on tradition and the Bible says Matthew 15 36 and9 he answered and said to them why\n\n(53:45) do you transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition and you voided the Commandments of God by your tradition but in vain they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men can you do it yes or no no you can't you cannot substitute tradition for obedience these people honor me with their lips but their\n\n(54:10) hearts are far from me they worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men and he said to them you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own Traditions Mark 7 and9 n so the Bible says one thing the Rome says another and here we have a basis for\n\n(54:34) conflict and this basis for conflict is going to rise like a mushroom and it's going to come to a head very very soon the authority of the church could therefore not be bound by the authority of the scriptures because the church had changed the Sabbath into Sunday not by the command of Christ but by its own\n\n(54:57) authority Canon and tradition page 263 that's it that's a choice whether we like it or whether we don't Acts 20 says for I know this that after my departure Grievous wolves come in and change the doctrines all right if you go to your churches and you ask them why do we keep Sunday then there is a Scurry and a\n\n(55:23) flurry and then there will be some scriptural evidence brought forward although all the authoritative writers have said there is no scriptural Authority for the transfer yet they will tell you there are texts in the Bible which said that they worshiped on the first day of the week and therefore we worship on the first day of the week or\n\n(55:43) they will say that Jesus abolished the Sabbath and nailed it to the cross and we no longer keep it therefore let no one judge you as to a Sabbath day quoting Colossians and all those texts or they will say to you how do we know what the Sabbath is you know there's been so much time and then it really\n\n(55:59) doesn't matter observe any day what day did God say You must observe the sabbath day imagine you have a randev view with your loved one that you haven't seen for a long time and she says Wednesday morning 7:00 I arrive please pick me up at the station and you think okay that's all right I love her I'll go on\n\n(56:24) Thursday do you think she'll be happy kind of doubt I kind of doubt it all right thank you the first day of the week let's have a look at these texts that are used to substantiate Sunday observance the first text we find in Matthew 28:1 it says there are eight texts about the first day of the week that are used the first one says in the\n\n(56:47) end of the Sabbath it became began to Dawn towards the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the seure and that's it is there anything anything about a change of the Sabbath yes or no it's a purely historic statement the new English Bible says the Sabbath had passed and it was Daybreak\n\n(57:05) on Sunday when Mary so and so and so and so so it's a purely factual statement there's nothing in it all right we can discard it Luke 23: 5456 by the way tells us that these women they kept the Sabbath they prepared spices anointments and rested on the Sabbath day according to the Commandment so they knew nothing\n\n(57:26) about a change when these women came on the first day it's because they didn't go on the Sabbath day because they rested according to the Commandment all right the second text we find in Mark 161 and 2 and when the Sabbath was passed Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and salomi had brought\n\n(57:44) spices that they might come and anoint them very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the seure at the rising of the sun anything about a change there not a word all right third text Mark 69 when Jesus was risen early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene out of whom he had cast\n\n(58:02) Seven Devils anything there about a change or is it just a statement of fact statement of fact nothing there about a change we can discard that one fourth text now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came to the seure bringing the spices so that's in Luke it's the other gospel he repeats\n\n(58:19) the story anything about a change nothing so we can discard that one we only got four left that we have deal with fifth one John 20:1 the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark until the seure and seeth the stone taken away from the seure anything there nothing that leaves us with\n\n(58:40) three six TS John 20: 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and says unto them peace be unto you this one is used quite often aha the disciples came together on the first day\n\n(59:00) of the week they were worshiping doesn't say so it says they came together on the first day of the week for what fear of the Jews you see on the Sabbath they knew they were relatively safe because no Jew would do anything he would think he would be breaking the Sabbath but when the Sabbath was over they were quaking\n\n(59:19) in their boots so it says nothing about worship that leaves two texts two texts and these are the hot ones acts 20:7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread Paul preached unto them ready to depart on the tomorrow and continued his speech until midnight now the new English Bible says on Saturday\n\n(59:47) night they came together ah they say well here's the text which says that they worshiped on the Sabbath day and they had communion they broke bread now let's Analyze This SE text carefully on the first day of the week they came together to break bread when does the first day start at the end of the Sabbath what time of day was that it was\n\n(1:00:13) in the evening so they came together when the first day of the week came it was evening and they came to break bread all right so that's one text we have to look at they came to break bread said but Paul preached to them ready to depart on the tomorrow so when the light should Dawn it would still be which day\n\n(1:00:34) Sunday Sunday the first day and he was going to go a long long way and he talked to them until midnight poor old uus was sitting there in the window and Paul was probably going on and on fell out the window remember the story and a Paul had to rush down and over him and he got up so this was not a Sunday morning meeting this was a\n\n(1:01:02) evening meeting but it wasn't held on the Sabbath because the Sabbath was holy they came together after the Sabbath Paul had a lot to tell them and if Sunday was so holy why was Paul going to March the next day many many kilometers on the so-called holy Sunday no no no so we only have one thing still to deal\n\n(1:01:24) with the breaking of the bread let's make sure that it was in the evening we read further in Acts 28 And1 there were many lights in the upper chambers where they were gathered together so it was dark right and it couldn't have been Sunday evening because that would have been the second day of the week so they\n\n(1:01:42) came together after the Sabbath when he therefore came up again and had broken bread and eaten he talked a long while even till break of day so he departed so even stayed longer and talked and then when it was Daylight off he went so it wasn't the holy day for him at all he was going to go away and that's the only\n\n(1:02:03) time we had with a meeting for them now as for the other bit the breaking of the bread Acts 2:46 says and they continued what's it say they daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house did they eat their meat with gladness of heart so they didn't have a communion they had meal supper together\n\n(1:02:24) that's what it was so we have one one text left one text left so in fact this text this pre one previous one supports the sanctity of the Sabbath cuz only after the Sabbath did they get together to discuss issues and then off they went eight St one Corinthians 161 and 2 now concerning the collection for the Saints\n\n(1:02:47) ah yes they held Church collection as I have given order to the churches of galatia even so you do upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store by way by the way the wioth translation brings it out nicely it says lay by at home as God has prospered him that there be no Gathering when I come so the\n\n(1:03:15) critics will say well they held a collection during the service in church no no no the text refers to a putting aside of the money on the first day of the week at home now let's think about that in the old days like with many people that still work today that earn their M money on a weekly basis when is\n\n(1:03:38) Payday on a weekly basis Friday Friday you get your pay the work is over you get your pay now you take your money and you take it home but in the mindset of the Hebrew Friday is the preparation you're getting ready for for the Sabbath Paul says put your money aside when on the first day of the week first day of the week the logical thing\n\n(1:04:04) is to work it all out put aside your your offering and your tithe and whatever you want to put aside Paul says no don't do it on the Friday when you get your money the Sabbath is coming the Sabbath is Holy do it early on the first day of the week after the Sabbath so when the Sabbath is over after Sunday\n\n(1:04:24) you go and sit down put aside your money so you don't use it during the next week and then keep it there until it can be collected so does it help Sunday worship or does it help Sabbath worship this text it's actually for Sabbath worship the Sabbath is so holy do it on the first day of the week so none of those\n\n(1:04:45) texts did it so did Jesus change the Sabbath Luke 4:16 and he came to Nazareth where had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up to read so Jesus kept the Sabbath Jesus said not one jot or one ttle would be removed from the law Matthew 5:17 to19 Jesus didn't change the Sabbath for\n\n(1:05:07) even here unto we are called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow him and we should walk even as he walked 1 John 2:6 so Jesus kept the Sabbath there's no evidence of a change of a Sabbath so where's the evidence Malachi 36 I am the Lord I change not Jesus didn't change\n\n(1:05:29) Psalms 894 my Covenant will I not break nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips God doesn't change Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 who changed it Catholic Church not Jesus if you love me then keep my Commandments if you love them keep their Commandments if you keep my\n\n(1:05:52) Commandments you shall abide in my love even as I have kept kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love and he said I know him and he that says I know him and keeps not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him that's strong words 1 John 2:4 that's it you either obey God or you don't for this is the love of God that\n\n(1:06:15) we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous 1 John 5:3 whosoever says that he lives in God should live just as Jesus Christ did he kept the Sabbath Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example if you love me keep my Commandments that's the example well the Christian world will\n\n(1:06:40) say the cross changed the Sabbath no it didn't let's have a look that day was the preparation that was Friday the word preparation is just used for that Friday preparing for the Sabbath Luke 23:54 and the women also which came Galilee followed beheld the seure and lay down his body you remember that story and\n\n(1:07:02) they returned prepare spice's ointment rested on the Sabbath there's no change here whatsoever according to the Commandment Luke and they found the stone rail rolled away again on the first day so the three days of the crucifixion you have the preparation that was Friday you have the Sabbath Jesus rested in the grave they rested in\n\n(1:07:25) on that day the the disciples and the women and on the first day things started up again no change no change so neither the the death nor the resurrection changes it can we really be sure which is the Sabbath day well what about that one let's have a look what astronomy teaches us Washington DC your letter 2 February\n\n(1:07:51) we had occasion to investigate the results of the work of specialists synchronology and we have never found one of them that has ever had the slightest doubt about the continuity of the weekly cycle since the beginning of the Christian era and that is US Naval Observatory Washington DC let's have a look at this people say we might have\n\n(1:08:12) lost the Sabbath well the Sabbath was instituted there in creation if we lost it then it was reestablished at the Mana because every week the Lord made made a special Miracle on that day the Mana lasted two days every other day it lasted one day so the saas if it should have been lost was reinstated over there\n\n(1:08:38) if it was lost thereafter it was reinstated at Mount s then if we come to 46 BC that's where the Justinian the Julian calendar at least was instituted so we have absolute continuity from from then onwards and the cross Falls in there and we've just read Jesus kept the Sabbath the disciples kept the Sabbath\n\n(1:09:03) and that falls in the Julian calendar there's no loss over there then in 1582 there's a change of the calendar and we move to the Gregorian calendar oh that's exciting I like that because the Gregorian calendar refers to whomp to Pope Gregory and Pope Gregory saw fit to change the times why cuz there was something\n\n(1:09:31) bothering him but by the way it didn't move the Sabbath at all we went in October to 1 2 3 4 15 October so we jumped a couple of days there but the weekly cycle was not affected at all so the Sabbath is intact it has never been lost by the way why did the Pope want to move the calendar those days what bothered him why did he change\n\n(1:10:05) the times I'll tell you what bothered him it bothered him that the Pas the Christian Pash was not 100% in line with the Pagan Feast of ishta which we still call Easter to this day and he wanted to shift the calendar those few days so that the world should keep all the Pagan feasts rather than recognize what it is in the Bible did\n\n(1:10:39) you know that there was War as a consequence the British decided no way are we going along with this there was War as a consequence but it was forced upon them because we will keep the Pagan f festivals we will not obey the Bible these people are very arrogant so no day is lost the date shifts from the 4th to\n\n(1:11:06) the 15th but the weekly cycle is intact which day are the Jews keeping today Saturday Saturday same as always Matthew 24:20 pray that your flight be not in the winter nor on the Sabbath day Jesus is saying 70 AD when they come to destroy this place pray that the Sabbath day will not be the day when you have to\n\n(1:11:28) flee so he foresaw the Sabbath still being in existence then one last text shake your heads go wake up what about Colossians 2:6 wow this one is used every time let no man therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of any holy day or the new moon or the Sabbath days that's the king King James version let no one\n\n(1:11:57) judge you regard to the Sabbath days now Sabbath days refers to the ceremonial Sabbath days the Sabbath day refers to the seven week or the 7 day week Sabbath let no one therefore judge you in meat or drink or in respect of a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day that's the American Standard Version all right\n\n(1:12:28) which of the Ten Commandments deals with eating and drinking and new moons and all of those any of them so which laws deal with eatings and drinking and new moons and things like that ceremon the ceremonial laws blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out\n\n(1:12:57) of the way nailing it to the Cross let no man therefore judge you so they say Jesus nailed the Sabbath to the Cross no Jesus never nailed the Sabbath to the Cross he nailed two things to the cross the whole of the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross because Jesus became the Fulfillment of the law and the\n\n(1:13:19) condemnation of the law was nailed to the cross but not the law it itself how do I know because it says over there that these laws this handwriting of ordinances which was against us and only the writings of Moses the ceremonial law were to be written in a book placed beside the ark as a witness says the Old Testament\n\n(1:13:47) against us so these were a shadow of things to come but the body the substance of them is Christ Colossians 2:17 so let's quickly recap the weekly Sabbath was instituted in Eden right okay and it points back to Creation it existed before sin there it is it points to Creation hallow my Sabbath keep the Sabbath for in six days\n\n(1:14:17) the Lord made the heavens the Earth the Sea and the Springs of water it reminds us of where we come from The Shadow sabbaths in other words the Feast of unle bread uh the Passover the Feast of the wave offering the first fruits all of those special sabbaths they could fall on any day but they pointed to the\n\n(1:14:38) ministry of Christ they point forward to Christ so the ceremonial Sabbath linked the sanctuary service the shadow service and pointed forway forward to Redemption so when Colossians says the the Sabbath was a shadow of things to come who did it point to Christ the substance thereof being Christ so when Christ died he nailed the\n\n(1:15:07) ceremonial law to the Cross we don't have to keep special sabbaths anymore we don't have to follow the rituals of the Passover which have to do with eating and drinking and how much of the Passover you were supposed to have and all those issues it deals with ceremonies but the Sabbath deals with creation and the ten\n\n(1:15:32) commandments so those are the only texts that are used against the Sabbath the disciples did they change the Sabbath Paul as his man as was went into them and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures talking to the Jews and then it says and he reasoned in the Sabbath with the Jews\n\n(1:15:55) and the Greeks and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles besought that these words may be preached to them the next Sabbath and the next Sabbath day almost the whole city came together we read that in Acts chap 1342 and 44 so Paul and the disciples preached on a Sabbath they kept the Sabbath whether they were\n\n(1:16:18) talking to Jews or whether they were talking to Gentiles so this is the bottom line here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep God's Commandments how many of them all 10 and the faith of Jesus Revelation 1412 I will put my laws into their minds and write them in my hearts that's quoting Hebrews 8:10 that's the New\n\n(1:16:45) Covenant the New Covenant is taking the Law of God putting it into the heart into the mind onto the hand into the forehead act accordingly think accordingly obey God the Catholic Church says no by my Divine Authority you will obey me and not them but the Bible says Revelation 2214 and this is New Testament blessed are they\n\n(1:17:14) that do his Commandments that they may have the right to the Tree of Life aha obedience is going to be a test and may enter in through the gates into the City and then if you are obedient we according to his promise look for a new Heaven and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 Peter 313 nobody now has the mark of the beast\n\n(1:17:46) nobody now has it when that law is enforced and it's coming because the pope has asked for it and don't think Islamic countries or judaic countries will be excluded the pope has asked for it and they will keep it when that law comes then the decision will be made and you choose either the one with the\n\n(1:18:08) cauliflower ears and the buck teeth or you choose the Lord one of the two the Bible says for as the new heavens and the new Earth which I shall make shall remain before me says the Lord so shall your seed and your name remain and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh\n\n(1:18:31) come to worship before me says the Lord Isaiah 66: 22:23 this is the new world will the Sabbath be kept in the new world yes or no yes what is this new moon thing doing over here the new moon from one new moon to another so on a monthly basis isn't the new Moon Festival a ceremonial law is that going to be kept well there's\n\n(1:18:54) something that will be kept on a monthly basis in heaven as well because the Bible says that the Tree of Life bore its fruits how many times once mon once a month so I have news for you oh yeah and the Bible says it bore how many manner of fruits 12 kinds of fruits and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the\n\n(1:19:21) Nations wow so let's Imagine This the tree of life will bear its fruit once a month and we will go and we will partake of the Tree of Life once a month the leaves maybe we make some tea the most delightful tea caffeine free of course from the tree of life it's going to be a feast folks and from one Sabbath to another\n\n(1:19:50) shall All Flesh come before the Lord and the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein forever Psalms 37:29 I have condemned no one tonight no individual I have not said anyone is lost who is keeping Sunday out of faithfulness of their hearts at the moment I've said none such thing I have just said there is a system on this\n\n(1:20:12) Earth that lays claim to the fact that it stands above God that it is higher than God and that it has Authority in your life over and above the authority of God and that very soon this test will come to a point when this Authority will be tested and your Allegiance will be on the line and you will be asked to choose the one or to\n\n(1:20:38) choose the other if you choose the one you choose the Beast and you obtain its Mark if you choose the other then you will obtain the Mark or the Seal of God and you will be sealed for God that's what it is obedience does not lie in the day alone because the Sabbath stands for how much of the law all of it because\n\n(1:21:02) the authority of the law is based on the seal so the Sabbath is merely the authentication of the whole law we must develop Christlike characters we must allow the Lord to change us we must have a relationship with the Lord by keeping the law no one's going to be saved by having a relationship with God we can be\n\n(1:21:27) saved and will be saved but if we have the right relationship with God we will also keep his law that's the bottom line I hope that this issue is clear tomorrow night we're going to deal with the beasts of Revelation 13 and particularly the people of this nation should be here it's thunderous stuff don't miss it thank you for coming\n\n(1:22:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] oh a [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:218_two_beasts_become_friends_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nTwo Beasts Prophecy,Papal Authority,Mark of the Beast,US Role,Religious Deception\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture by Walter Veith, \"Two Beasts Become Friends,\" delves into prophetic interpretations from the books of Daniel and Revelation, identifying two significant \"beasts\" that influence global events. The first beast is linked to the Papacy and the Roman Catholic Church, characterized as a political and religious entity that blasphemes God, persecutes saints, and seeks to change \"times and laws,\" primarily God's laws, exemplified by the shift from Sabbath to Sunday worship and the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. This power, which experienced a \"mortal wound\" in 1798 but whose influence is prophesied to heal, is said to embody aspects of ancient Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek, and Roman philosophies. The second beast is identified as the United States of America, initially possessing \"lamb-like principles\" of liberty and religious freedom, but predicted to eventually \"speak like a dragon,\" enforcing religious legislation and compelling the world to worship the first beast. The lecture emphasizes that the core \"mark of the beast\" is not a physical chip but doctrinal adherence to man-made laws that contradict God's commandments, particularly regarding the Sabbath, thereby constituting a rejection of God's authority.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 218 - Two Beasts Become Friends _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpdsQODHhOk\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] two beasts become friends that's the topic of today's lecture and the question is who are these two beasts and how does it impact upon us well we can only understand these beasts if we have studied Daniel chapter 7 where the attributes of this Beast are explained to us now we're not\n\n(01:29) doing Daniel chapter 7 because we're doing a revelation seminar there is however a whole video on that subject in Daniel chapter 7 the attributes of the beast power are given there it is described as a horn which is also in Daniel a political entity or a king a king or a kingdom and this power would be diverse\n\n(01:54) from the first different to all the other kings now if you study Daniel 7 you'll see that the attributes given there will be taken up again in Revelation 13 so the same system will be described in a different format in Revelation chapter 13 but what is interesting about this political entity is that it's different from all the\n\n(02:19) others and the reason why it is different because it's also ecclesiastical it is also a religious system because its main emphasis is religion it has a quarrel with the Saints of the most high and it is Blasphemous towards the most high Daniel 7:25 says and he shall speak great words against the most high and he\n\n(02:47) shall wear out the Saints so this has a potic agenda and it has a religious agenda of the most high and think to change times and laws it'll change the times and it will change the laws fascinating if you think about this system and this system apply can apply only to one institution and that is Rome\n\n(03:10) no other institution covers every single aspect of the little horn power we haven't got time to go into all the details it has changed the times and it has changed the laws the laws of God and the times of God we'll come to that a little later and they shall be given into his hand until the time and times\n\n(03:33) and the dividing of times we pick this prophecy up in Revelation chap 11 where they would have controlling power for these three and a half prophetic years the 1, 1260 prophetic days the 1,260 literal years now the Beast of Revelation 13 is a conglomerate of what we had in in Daniel 7 there are various aspects\n\n(04:04) surrounding this animal it has the head of a lion the mouth of a lion now lion the lion represented Babylon in Daniel chapter 7 then it has the feet of a bear and the bear represented Meo Persia and then it has the body of this leopard and the leopard represents Greece in Daniel 7 and then it has the 10 horns and the\n\n(04:34) seven heads and this these 10 horns represent uh the 10 kingdoms that we have in terms of the creatures in Daniel chapter 7 and the toes of the statue in Daniel chapter 2 so this is a conglomerate Beast having components philosophies if you like of Meo Persia Greece Rome and uh Babylon and it speaks\n\n(05:04) with the mouth of a lion so it speaks Babylonian language and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast arise out of the sea sea Nations peoples multitudes the waters that you saw so it comes out amongst the Nations having seven heads 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of\n\n(05:30) blasphemy there you have the link with Daniel chapter 7 this Blasphemous power that is against the most high comes up amongst the Nations and in Daniel chapter 7 we see that it comes up in Rome in the Roman Empire and particularly the Western Roman Empire and this influence would spread across the entire world and the Beast which I\n\n(05:56) saw was like unto a leopard it therefore has Greece in it it has Grecian philosophy if you like and the Roman Church certainly has uh the philosophy of the Greeks in it because it uh supports Aristotle and all of these great philosophers and Oregon and all the Greek Scholars that arrived later in the\n\n(06:23) Roman Empire are also represented and his feet were as the feet of a bear does does Rome have Meo Persian philosophy absolutely Mitra ism is the main thrust of the religion it even has the Triple Crown which comes from meido Persia and the mouth was this the mouth of the lion is the Babylonian religion of Isis and\n\n(06:47) Osiris of Baal and ashar are all these religions embodied in it the answer is yes if we go to Babylon the lion was a symbol of Babylon but the sad story is that the dragon gave him his power and his seat in great Authority Revelation chapter 1 and 2 complete or verses 1 and two tell us the sad story that behind\n\n(07:12) this power is the dragon and the dragon is none other than the Devil Revelation 12:9 identifies the dragon as Satan but Satan Works through human agencies in Revelation 12 the dragon worked through Pagan Ro home and attempted to destroy Jesus was a Roman official who tried to kill the baby Jesus a governor who\n\n(07:38) condemned Jesus an executioner who crucified in an emblem sealed his tomb and a god watched his tomb so there is the Roman aspect and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies so this religious political entity would blaspheme God and power was has given him to continue 40\n\n(08:01) and2 months there is the 42 month period 42 * 30 prophetic days is 1,260 days and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name that's the character of God and his Tabernacle that's the sanctuary service that means the path of Salvation which is explained there robs people of the\n\n(08:29) saving power of Jesus Christ has this power done this yes is that substituted Saints and Mary and all kinds of intermediaries even the church itself and its uh delegates to mediate on behalf of man and them that dwell in heaven and thus they blaspheme the very God Of Heaven Revelation 135 and 6 and power was given unto him to continue 40\n\n(08:58) and2 months Revelation 13:5 so it would do this openly publicly for those 42 prophetic months 42 months 42 * 30 1,260 days a day for a year I've given you a day for your year Ezekiel 4:6 that brings us to the same story that we found in Revelation 11 where vigilus ascended the papal chair 538 ad under\n\n(09:27) the protection of belisarius That's History so we have a starting date when the papacy started to exercise the power from the decree that Justinian had issued giving it the power to correct all Heretics those who dared to think for themselves so the legally recognized supremacy of the Pope began in 538 ad\n\n(09:52) and then went into effect the emperor's uh decree as I have said where he was the correct of Heretics so Rome today still claims to be the sole one who can determine what you should believe because the papacy claims infallibility and cannot make a mistake on doctrinal issues uh Lanka professor of history at the University of Rome\n\n(10:17) says to the succession of the Caesars came the succession of the pontiffs in Rome when Constantine left Rome he gave his seat to the pontiff this is based on the so-called letters of Constantine which are forgeries and have been proved to be such but nevertheless that is the story the transfer of The Emperor's\n\n(10:37) residence to Constantinople was a sad Blow To The Prestige of Rome and at the time one might have predicted a speedy decline but the development of the church and the growing authority of the bishop of Rome or the pope gave her a new lease of life and made her again the capital this time the religious capital\n\n(10:55) of the Civilized world that's Abbott's Roman history that is just a fact the Bible says and it was given unto him to make war with the Saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations that is a prophetic statement this system will control how much of the world all of it all of it so power was\n\n(11:22) given over the Saints during the 1,260 year period but this power would control the the whole world Stanley's history says the popes filled the place of the vacant Emperor at Rome inheriting their power Prestige titles from paganism Constantine left all to the bishop of Rome which is not true but nevertheless the papacy is\n\n(11:43) about but the ghost of the deceased Roman Empire sitting crowned upon its grave so we have an emperor he even has the title he even has the title pontif effect Maximus which belonged to the Roman Emperor so in effect the pope is the emperor of Rome today has the church persecuted Western Watchman Catholic\n\n(12:03) Source yes it doesn't deny that it has persecuted that it has used the severest penalties even death and had the state execute these penalties I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death so there is a mortal wound and his deadly wound was healed and some on the world wondered after the Beast oh no it doesn't say\n\n(12:34) that it says all the world wondered after the Beast now this over here is a very interesting statement I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death some translations say seemed to have a mortal wound is there a difference between seemed or it were and had a mortal wound yes or no yes so it seemed to have a mortal wound\n\n(13:07) but maybe that was deception maybe it just copied Jesus Christ because if this is anti Christos Antichrist in the place of Jesus Christ it follows the whole concept this system has placed itself as the mediator this system forgives the sin this system gives you a new lease of Life opens the door to heaven or to hell\n\n(13:36) and this system also receives a wound and is resurrected so it is a counterfeit of Christ if you like but it seems to have a mortal wound so that is the 1,260 year period 538 to 1798 one of the heads seemed to have a mortal wound so in this time period it seems to die but it doesn't really die it actually goes underground but as\n\n(14:07) a beast it dies because it loses political power and then that political power will be given back and there is a resurrection of this Beast this is what the Bible is saying so in 1798 remember bertia made his entrance into Rome he abolished the papal government Nao with his Freemason Army if you like\n\n(14:33) established a secular government so says the enyclopedia Britannica leaving the Freemason stuff out bartier entered Rome on the 10th of February 1798 and proclaimed the Republic thus fulfilling this prophecy to the letter half of Europe thought Napoleon's veto would be obeyed and that with the Pope the papacy was dead modern\n\n(14:56) papacy Reverend Joseph rickaby it's like quoting the Bible so exactly 1,260 days the murder of a Frenchman in Rome in 1798 gave the French the excuse to enter church history says and They Carried him off into Exile the pope and the Beast received a mortal wound and I saw one of the heads as it were wounded\n\n(15:23) to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wed after the Beast now surely that's not possible not everybody's going to follow Catholicism Revelation 133 or are they that's the question we have to ask remember the San Francisco Chronicle article where it said the Vatican was at peace with Italy and the autographs both\n\n(15:49) sides were very cordial to one another and the wound was healed between the two Revelation 13:7 says and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations that's scary Rome will control the entire world that's what it says so a universal religious power controlling the conscience of the entire\n\n(16:21) world that's what the promise is and they worship the dragon so if you follow the system unwittingly you are actually worshiping the dragon which gave power unto the Beast because it is a deception Jesus Christ has been replaced by this Antichrist system something in the place of Jesus Christ and they worship the\n\n(16:49) Beast so the Beast receives homage and we have a father son sort of system here saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him so if you oppose it do you get obliterated by War probably and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God to blaspheme his name and his Tabernacle we've discussed\n\n(17:18) that already that's the ministry of Christ and them that dwell in heaven God himself is blasphemed Jesus is removed in their writings and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world Revelation 13:4\n\n(17:39) to8 so don't you think it is important that Roman Catholics should know that if they are in this system and knowingly cooperate with this system that they are actually worshiping the dragon I was pleased when I found this out know ye not that to whom you to yield yourself servants to obey his servants are ye whom you\n\n(18:04) obey whether of sin unto death or obedience unto righteousness Romans 6:16 so if you allow obey the system well then you are part of it for thou said in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will be like the most high he wants the worship so if we worship the\n\n(18:23) system we're actually worshiping the dragon the pope has been man of the Earth and uh prophets I believe have looked down the stream of time Billy Graham said he'll go down in history as the greatest of modern popes fascinating he really will he has a will and a determination to help Humanity through\n\n(18:50) spirituality well maybe that should be corrected and say spiritualism that is marvelous that is good I know how difficult it is for leaders on these issues thus said the Dal Lama now what is this about blasphemy Revelation 13:6 he opened his mouth in blasphemy Daniel 7:25 he shall speak great words against the most high what\n\n(19:15) does it mean to speak great words against the most high there are two definitions in the Bible John chapter 1033 and the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy me because thou being a man make thyselves God who opposes and exalted himself themselves above all that is called God or that he's\n\n(19:38) worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God two Thessalonians 24 describing the Antichrist power saying that it is God and taking the place of God he'll do the Forgiveness of sins he'll do these things and the other things so the Bible defines blasphemy me as assuming any\n\n(19:59) right or power that belongs to God Alone now let's read Pap statements Ferraris ecclesiastical dictionary the pope is of so great dignity and so exalted that he's not a mere man but as it were God and the Vicor of God so there's a Papal statement where the popac he claims to be God just like the Roman Emperor claimed to be God so he\n\n(20:21) STS it himself Pope Leo said we hold upon this Earth the place of God almighty here's another definition of blasphemy Luke 5:21 and the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason saying who is this who speaks blasphemy who can forgive sins but God alone so if you say you can forgive sins that's blasphemy for there is one God and one\n\n(20:47) mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus says 1 Timothy 2:5 uh here comes another system and uh the Pope says in the on the authority of the councils all names which in the scripture are applied to Christ by virtue of which it is established that he is over the church all the same names are applied to the pope so the papacy\n\n(21:09) takes the place of Jesus Christ and they claim God himself is obliged to abide by the Judgment of his priests and either not to Pardon or to Pardon according as they refuse or give Absolution the sentence of the priest precedes and God subscribes to it what dignity and duty of the priest so the priest is higher than God the priest\n\n(21:33) will decide whether you are forgiven or not and God has no choice but to obey his priest isn't that pathetic that's arrogance of the highest order here's another statement the poor sinner kneels at the confessor's feet he knows he's not speaking to an ordinary man but to another Christ he hears the words I absolve thy\n\n(21:54) sins and the Hideous load of sin drops from him soul forever shall I be a priest these are all Roman Catholic statements If any man have an ear let him hear he that leadth into captivity shall go into captivity he that kth with a sword must be killed with a sword here is the patience and the faith of the\n\n(22:17) Saints Revelation 13 9-10 now Daniel told us something more about this power it told us that it would change the times and the laws now we've already discussed that the papacy changed the law of God it took out the second commandment made the fourth Commandment now the third commandment applied to Sunday rather than Sabbath\n\n(22:41) and then it uh divided the tenth commandment into two so that it still has 10 commandments it's changed the law has it changed the times has Rome changed the times absolutely which times has it changed just about everything which C which calendar are we keeping we are keeping the Gregorian calendar the Gregorian calendar who was\n\n(23:09) g Gregory he was a pope why did Gregory change the calendar because he had to change the times you see he had to change the times now today is a good day to talk about this because today is the Feast of Isa oh sorry let's rephrase that today is Easter and the Feast of ISTA and Easter are two very different things Easter\n\n(23:37) there is no such thing you see the Pas was determined the Passover was determined by the phases of the moon and the day of the Passover was determined by the new moon so when the new moon came then the days were counted and and the Passover could take place on any day it didn't have to be a a a Friday a Saturday and a\n\n(24:06) Sunday the Passover could take place on any day depending on the pH of the new moon but the Feast of ishta was on the first day of the week so the papacy changed the calendar in order to bring it in line with the Feast of Isa and today they've changed the rule of the Old Testament where you count the days and made it apply so that\n\n(24:30) Isa can only fall on a Sunday only fall on a Sunday whereas in the past it could fall on any day now that is saying that they distantiated themselves from the Passover Lamb even worse if you now by chance because this can happen and it happened just a few years ago in fact I can't remember the exact date when the pope was in America\n\n(24:57) that's exactly when it happened happened by the way it just so happened that the Feast of Easter and the Feast of the Passover happened to coincide and be on the same day what did they do then well then they freak you see they don't like that so the pope then postpones Easter by one week and that's what they did they\n\n(25:20) postponed Easter by one week so that it D not fall on the day of the P because we want nothing to do with the lamb that died for us we serve have another purpose Isa is a pagan Feast so he changed the feast days he F changed the times so that it can fall into line with that he changed the whole calendar to\n\n(25:39) bring it in line with the Pagan feast and he changed the law of God so the the sword must be killed with the sword he who kills with a sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience of and the faith of the Saints Revelation 139 to10 so 1798 the papacy gets a mortal wound receives a mortal wound he is killed with a sword\n\n(26:05) as he has killed with a sword before that and now the prophet looks around we have a date 1798 this Mortal wound takes place and I saw another Beast coming up out of the earth now if C represents peoples multitudes Nations tongues then what must Earth represent a place where you do not have a multitude of peoples and Nations and\n\n(26:29) tongues and I saw another Beast another political entity coming up out of an area on the planet where there are not peoples and multitudes and Nations so it cannot be Europe it cannot be Asia it cannot be those Middle Eastern countries here comes another political entity and it had two horns like a lamb so it has\n\n(26:51) lamb-like principles but it'll speak like a dragon that's interesting Revelation 1311 now who's this power well let's go to the early reformers these people were magnificent I have so much respect for these early reformers John Wesley in his notes on Revelation 13 written in 1754 says the two-horned Beast he is not\n\n(27:15) yet come though he cannot be far off for he is to appear at the end of the 42 months of the first Beast now the reformers all clearly said Rome is the Antichrist they were watch watching it and now they say well this other Beast can't be far off the question is which power arises at exactly this time in an area\n\n(27:40) where there are no great multitudes of Nations there's only one that qualifies and that would be the United States now many many years ago these images were already interpreted as such although the United States was a relative insignificant power let's have a look at the rise of the United States and see if it fits the Declaration of\n\n(28:04) Independence was in 1776 the Independence was acknowledged by the nations of the world in 1783 in 178c 87 a Constitution of the United States was framed 1791 the Bill of Rights was added and in 1798 the very year that Rome receives a mortal wound France the mightiest power in Europe at that time recognizes the independence of the\n\n(28:37) United States so the same nation that gives the papacy a mortal wound in the same year recognizes the United States so it receives a mortal wound he looked the prophet and he saw another Beast to rise spot on prophetically 1863 the slave emancipation act similar to what Napoleon did in Europe the Eiffel Tower\n\n(29:05) is a symbol of Freemasonry the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of Freemasonry 1798 a very important date liberty and justice for all that is the lamb-like principle a dragon the previous power said Harry them out of the land or hang them so that's how the dragon speaks and that's how the lamb speaks here is a lamb-like principle\n\n(29:33) Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof Jesus said the same Render unto Caesar what is due unto Caesar and to God what is due unto God he didn't come to make uh you force you into decisions you can choose accept him or reject him but no\n\n(29:54) religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public Trust trust under the United States that's a lamb-like principle we hold these truth to be self-evident that all men are created equal and that they are undou by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty\n\n(30:13) and the pursuit of happiness Oxford history of the American people wonderful llike principles but this constitution will have to be changed if there is to be religious legislation and persecution even the Constitution will have to go by the way we have moved from a republic to a democracy America was not a democracy it\n\n(30:38) was a republic you could choose but there's a vast difference between a republic and a democracy a vast difference you know if 10 wolves and one lamb have to vote on an issue at what is for lunch the lamb will end up being lunch in a democracy it's 10 to1 you understand and a republic has totally different principles to a democracy the\n\n(31:04) the Constitution is Central in a republic and you cannot just vote it away but that seems to have changed the Bible says Revelation 13:11 he spoke like a dragon now the dragon gave the first Power its seat and great Authority and it used the to do what to blaspheme God and to persecute the Saints didn't it do\n\n(31:31) that exactly do you think the second power could start doing the same thing think it's possible Revelation 12:17 and the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her Offspring those who obey God's Commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus oh so if you cling to the word\n\n(31:52) of God and to what the prophets have said and you obey God God's Commandments rather than man's Commandments do you think you could get into trouble here with a dragon so he spoke as a dragon how did this Dragon speak let's ask Rome how she spoke this is the syllabus of Pope Pas I 9th given in 1864 the state has not the right to\n\n(32:19) leave every man free to embrace whatever religion he shall deem true all right that was dragon language the church has the right to require that the Catholic religion shall be the religion of the state to the exclusion of all others cursed be those who assert Liberty of conscience and of worship and such that\n\n(32:37) maintain that the church may not employ Force that's dragon language pretty clear the Roman Catholic Church Must demand the right to freedom for herself alone Catholic statement the Roman Catholic is to wield his vote for the purpose of securing CL Catholic ascendancy in this country Catholic World July 1870 that's dragon\n\n(33:00) language but Revelation 13:12 says it the second power exercises all the authority of the first Beast before him so it will do the same as the first one did in the old world what then and causes the Earth and those dwelling in it how much of the world is that everybody two worship the first Beast aha now how do you force someone to\n\n(33:33) worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was now healed how do you force by legislation someone to worship the first Beast the only way you can do that is through laws which govern the conscience is that right so if the first Beast has a rule or rules and says this is the standard that I want implement it and I feel hey I want\n\n(34:02) nothing to do with that that's contrary to the law of God and the second power comes along and says if you don't Sizzle fits what then then the second power is enforcing laws of the first Power and if I then obey those laws then what am I actually doing I'm worshiping the first piece because it made the laws isn't that\n\n(34:30) correct and so I'll be in big trouble with God because what if those laws are contrary to the law of God then I have to make a choice okay that's what the Bible says what will happen the second beast will do exactly that and it does great wonders so that it makes Fire come down from heaven onto the Earth in the\n\n(34:50) sight of men what is that what could be literal fire but I think we're dealing with spiritual fire here and it deceives those dwelling on the earth now a literal fire is not very deceptive it's pretty painful but a spiritual fire that could be problematic so this second power will use deception in order to do this\n\n(35:18) because of the Miracles which were given to it to do before the Beast so if you see within the second be let's say the United States a power that sends a spirit out fire Holy Spirit but it is a false spirit and it is a deceptive spirit and it is full of Miracles and signs and wonders well then you have a\n\n(35:46) problem there's a lecture coming up and it's called Strange Fire Tuesday evening whatever you do don't miss that lecture I'm going to show you something strange fire that you cannot believe which were given to it to do before the Beast saying to those dwelling on the earth that they should make an image to the\n\n(36:08) Beast who had the wound and By The Sword and live how do you make an image to something what's an image an image is something that looks like the original isn't that right if I look into a mirror what do I see I see an image something that looks like me right it's not me it's just an image but it looks like me now how did\n\n(36:29) the what did the first Beast look like the first Beast was a religious power using the state to enforce its doctrines is that correct so now what if the second beast becomes a religious power using the state to enforce its doctrines but those doctrines happen to be the doctrines of the first Beast Rome and they're forcing\n\n(36:53) the whole world to obey Rome wouldn't I be in trouble then exactly ly but that's what the Bible says what will happen the second beast will make laws and enforce them just like the first one did thereby creating an image something that is just like the previous one was and they will enforce laws and\n\n(37:16) he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast so this was a pretty powerful uh political entity that the image of the Beast should both speak and cause that as many who would not worship the image of the Beast should be killed do you think the United States has the power to say if you little country don't\n\n(37:36) listen to me today away you go yes or no I think so they have the power to do that and they certainly have done it of late Revelation 13:15 Now isn't that interesting as we saw yesterday already that uh even in the architecture the one is an image of the other isn't that fascinating so this fascinating building\n\n(38:04) and all its laws and statutes which are protected by the Constitution here is the first Beast here's a priest going into the Vatican and there is a Swiss God representing the state protecting the church here you have the pope with all the flags of the Nations around him is it possible that the nations of the\n\n(38:25) world will rally around him how the pope will change the world Esquire magazine he certainly will this was the most charismatic pope of all times and uh Ronald Reagan was the one who started off making a deal which started to contravene the Constitution of the United States Harry Truman tried to do that in\n\n(38:49) 1951 he got such a blast even from the pit of his by his own Minister when he wanted to recognize the Vatican that he dropped it but uh Ronald Reagan no problem he just did it even the president's own Baptist pastor in Washington denounced the idea from the pulpit when Truman did it here is a masonic signal picture\n\n(39:14) remember the finger to the mouth what that meant that is a sign of Horus silence secrecy the folded hands mean something only President Ronald Reagan and the pope who were present in the Vatican library on that day one of the earliest goals as President Reagan says was to recognize the Vatican as a state and\n\n(39:37) make them an ally that's contrary to the American Constitution both of them received a mini W wound and lived that's not significant it's just interesting just interesting it's almost like the imag is following the Beast John Paul's Triumph here we have another signal picture we have gorbachov and the papacy together\n\n(40:03) they exchanged some gifts the party comes to an end Communism had served its purpose it could go and the man was without a country this was a nice joke in the South African magazine the egg being communism and he said M there's nothing in here you see it was a ruse to make people believe something or other and\n\n(40:30) then finally who would get the credit for the fall of Communism if Communism had been set up to subjugate the Orthodox church and to eliminate Protestant thinking in the east of Germany which it certainly did once it had accomplished that communism could go and be dissipated and who would get the credit for that\n\n(40:58) the pope would get the credit for that how do we know that because Mary had already supposedly in Fatima said the pope will consecrate the whole world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and Russia will be converted that was easy to say because the bolik had just taken power in 1917 the very year when that statement\n\n(41:19) was made they knew they had it in the bag not too difficult the three Secrets not too bad either the first was a vision of Hell which makes no sense whatsoever the second one was Russia will be consecrated they'd taken power anyway and the third one was that a future Pope would receive a attack on his life but survive and issue in the\n\n(41:42) final events now if you know history in advance because you are creating it that's no problem now did the papacy receive the honor for that well let's ask the presidents of the United States whether that is so this is the paper visit to the United States since Louie let's ask the then time President Bill\n\n(42:03) Clinton to tell us what he thinks 2400 of his faithful here to welcome him he's waving to the crowd Archbishop rali is alongside the pope as he shakes stand with the first lady we honor you for helping to lead a revolution of values and spirit in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union freeing Millions to live by\n\n(42:38) conscience not coercion and freeing all of us from the constant fear of nuclear war your Holiness on behalf of all of us gathered here today indeed on behalf of all the people of our beloved Nation we welcome you back to America America ladies and gentlemen his Holiness Pope John Paul II and the vice president of the United\n\n(43:12) States and Archbishop so who received the honor for bringing down the Soviet Union the pope we honor you for freeing Millions so interesting fulfillment of Prophecy Herman Melman America has been settled by people of all Nations all nations may claimer for their own we are not a narrow tribe of men no our blood is as\n\n(43:39) the flood of the Amazon made up of thousands of noble currents or pouring into one we are not a nation so much as a world and all the world wondered after the beasts now that means every single country remember the question we had in the beginning do you think it's possible that every country would be subject to\n\n(44:01) him Pope John Paul superar now this church the Roman Church claims to be the mother of all the churches here it says iMat Ecclesia the mother of all the churches still to be closed is the most important Rift of all between the world's 350 million that figure has changed Protestants and about 800 million that figure has changed to 1.2\n\n(44:32) billion by now today however hatchets are being buried so not only in the political sphere must she gain ascendency but also in the religious sphere and that'll take a whole lecture by itself now religiously all the religions must come together and be subject to the system Roma said this is Pope John Paul 2 this\n\n(44:58) is their own Catholic magazine Southern Cross in 1995 he said for unity all churches must accept papal Authority I have news for you that that's not only include Christian churches that includes all religions of the entire world and then Hands Across The Sea ransy and the papacy make a deal and Christian\n\n(45:24) Unity comes into being and he performed great and miraculous signs even causing fire to come down from Heaven to Earth in the full view of men Revelation 13:13 so the second power would now use religion as an entering wedge for uniting the world under one system question in the last few years has religion become a topic on this planet\n\n(45:55) yes or no ah and which religions are representing thesis and antithesis the Judea Christian culture pitted against the Islamic culture and out of that must come a synthesis we are living in interesting times because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first Beast he deceived the inhabitants of the earth Acts\n\n(46:26) chapter 2:3 they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came down to rest on them is it going to use some form of religious fervor supposedly by the holy spirit because fire came down that was the holy spirit's outpouring upon the people is religious fervor going to bring about The\n\n(46:49) Clash do you think that's possible wow I think it's never been more possible than today the Bible I believe is spot on the Bible tells us that the United States of America which will Arise at exactly the right time will change its tune from lamb-like principles to Dragon principles and become a persecuting\n\n(47:14) power just like Rome was of old and that the whole world would follow this Beast he was granted power says Revelation 13:15 to give breath to the image of the Beast that the image of the Beast should both speak so this new religio political power would make its voice heard and cause as many as would not worship the\n\n(47:41) image of the Beast to be killed you either go along with this or you're out so the basic tenant is shape up or ship out isn't that right that's it shape up or ship out well you know the the president of the United States is making noises like that you're either for us or against us did he say that isn't that\n\n(48:03) interesting isn't that interesting church and state are they going to work together is there going to be an image something to pay homage to is the Constitution going to be amended great controversy page 445 the image of the Beast represents that form of apostate protestantism which will be developed\n\n(48:23) when the Protestant churches shall seek the aid of the civil power for the enforcement of their dogmas it is a mistake to apply American Democratic procedures to the faith and the truth Time Magazine January 1995 well that's contrary to the Constitution they call that a mistake these days well remember he causes all\n\n(48:45) both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foret and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name there's a nice package deal there Revelation 1316 to 17 here are the issues that are at stake so if you do\n\n(49:08) not take the mark of the beast that's the first past so we have to ask what is the mark of the first Beast now today people think that is a computer Mark or a chip in the hand that might be a means of controlling buying and selling and yes there are devices that have been created to put in your hand or under the\n\n(49:30) skin of your forehead which will say where you are and what your banking details are and work like a credit card and all these things but my question to you is this is a credit card something that dictates the conscience yes or no is a dollar note something that dictates the conscience yes or no no what dictates\n\n(49:53) conscience right or wrong and this is a mark a distinguishing feature if you like of the first Beast which is Catholicism is a computer chip a distinguishing feature of Catholicism yes or no or are we dealing with Doctrine surely we are dealing with Doctrine is God concerned if your can of beans is scanned by a\n\n(50:19) barcode and leaves you out of Heaven because of that yes or no or is God concerned if you decide not to obey him but rather an Earthly power contrary to his will would he be concerned then yes it's a question of aliance so yes maybe there will be a chip maybe they will enforce it on the hand and enforce it on the forehead\n\n(50:42) whatever that's not the mark of the beast because the Beast has been defined as Catholicism did a computer chip change the law of God yes or no did a computor chip persecute the Saints did a comp computer chip change the times no so buying and selling you can only do it if you accept the mark of the beast here\n\n(51:07) is wisdom let him that has understanding count the number of the Beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 603 score and six it is the number of a what a man not of a can of beans in Walmart or wherever right it's not a can of beans it's the number of a man well here's a man what are the\n\n(51:32) letters inscribed on the Pope's crown and what do they signify of anything the letters inscribed on the props M of Vicario F day which is the Latin for the Vicor of the Son of God so there it is vicarius Fel and if you add that up numerically if you give the Latin numerical value to the names numbers then you get to\n\n(51:57) exactly 666 and there is no way of getting around that one for a while there this might have disappeared and the people said there was no such title but of course it is in the Articles of the papacy though they cannot deny that that title literally exists triple six symbolizes the union of era in Greek you have Greek numerical\n\n(52:24) value the Latin Kingdom hatina basala if you add the Greek numerical value you get to 666 the Italian Church italica Ecclesia 666 the Latin speaking man these are all official titles of the papacy they all work out to 666 that's interesting so the the system has a number 666 and the man the Antichrist vicarios F die Vicor of God\n\n(52:54) here on Earth means literally in the place of Jesus Christ that's what it means so in actual fact the papacy says call me in the place of Jesus Christ in the place of his auntie call me Antichrist couldn't have done us a bigger favor he identifies himself mark of the beast what is that first we must\n\n(53:17) understand God's mark his seal or his sign and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God remember we discussed this when we discussed the earlier chapters of Revelation cried with a loud voice and was given him to Earth the sea saying hurt not the Earth neither the\n\n(53:34) sea till we have sealed the Servants of our God in the forehead so settled in them in the truth that they cannot be moved the seal authenticates a document so the president has a seal moreover I gave them my Sabbath that there might be a sign between me and them that they might know that I am the Lord that\n\n(53:56) sanctify ifies them Ezekiel 2012 and of course if you take that sign it's O it means a mark God has a mark So God's seal contains his name his title his territory I the Lord yve his title Creator territory Heaven and Earth it's in the heart of his law remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days\n\n(54:22) you shalt labor and do all thy work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord y God for why in six days yve the Lord made Creator Heaven and Earth by the way remove the Sabbath as we have said before and the entire law has no stamp of authority it could be from Joo but because the Sabbath is in there\n\n(54:50) the entire law gets its Authority from none other than the creator of Heaven and Earth so now what if you take this law and you modify it and you put a different stamp on there what do you do then what happens then so Satan has attacked the Sabbath because it is the Seal of God it is the mark of authority which makes the\n\n(55:13) whole of the law valid remember Daniel 7:25 he will think to change times and laws well let's ask the pope whether he does that deal transl episcope the pope has power to change times to abrogate laws to dispense with all things even the precepts of Christ that's pretty arrogant he can do whatever he likes no\n\n(55:38) wonder he has the sign of Horus on his lapel over there that's the symbol of Horus by the way Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever Hebrews 138 Jesus doesn't change so why should the papacy have the right to change the law of God What specifically is the mark of the beast well what's the best way of\n\n(56:00) finding out isn't the best way of finding out asking why don't we ask them what's your mark the mark of the beast must be a sign of the Roman Church's Authority wasn't it let's ask them Cardinal Gibbons of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was her act changing Sabbath to Sunday and the ACT\n\n(56:24) is a mark of her ecclesi I astical power and authority in religious matters so she claims it is her Mark of power here's another statement Catholic record September 1 1923 Sunday is our Mark of authority the church is above the Bible and this transference of Sabbath observant is proof of that fact so this\n\n(56:49) is a in your face God we the church have power to change your law and our stamp of approval that we can do it our seal is that we change the day of worship by the way which is the international day of worship today Sunday Sunday that's right in Muslim countries the day of worship is on Friday but on which day is are the\n\n(57:18) stores closed Sunday on Sunday that's right in Israel the day is the Sabbath but on which day are the banks closed on Sunday and the minister of the Interior wants to introduce Sunday as the second rest day that's interesting says the Pope get on with it get on with the world government on his tour to Poland Pope John Paul denounced\n\n(57:46) excessive materialism and the separation of church and state time 17 1991 so what about the union of church and state where the American Constitution separates them I want to hear some Americans stand up and shout give us Justice give us decency and to hell with a constitution that was the Catholic news\n\n(58:08) already in 1963 this is rquest he's the Chief Justice of the of the United States he said the wall of separation between church and state is a metaphor based on bad history that's a sad statement wow a metaphor which has proved useless as a guide to judging it should be frankly and explicitly abandoned okay is the United States\n\n(58:38) beginning to speak like a dragon yes or no it's a very much dragon language there it is ranquist said these very words a metaphor based on bad history yes Keith tunia Time Magazine 1995 he said the wall of separation between church and state that was erected by secular humanists hello can they twist\n\n(59:00) the truth and other enemies of religious freedom I thought it was put there by the friends of religious freedom didn't you well has to come down those opposing our views are the new fascists now that's interesting this is the pot calling the kettle black isn't that fascinating so now a fascist is calling\n\n(59:24) a fascist a fascist that is Jesuit dlec thinking it's brilliant it's so clever because only a fascist can make a rule dictating conscience and if you refuse to B the a rule because you accept another rule then you by principle here are a fascist because you are accepting a totalitarian regime you're accepting God but they are\n\n(59:51) accepting another one and that's the state you see fascinating The Clash is becoming interesting St Louis Post Dispatch as the second century of the Bill of Rights draws to a close the Supreme Court is redefining what religious liberty will mean in the 3 Century broadly the Court's new approach helps conventional religions\n\n(1:00:10) while hurting unconventional ones you better join the ship or else is that what it says okay it gets worse I am the bearer of bad news but fortunately I am all cheerful about it have you noticed and uh that's something people find very hard to understand I'm all cheerful about it not because I have discovered this because I haven't I'm\n\n(1:00:37) just a parrot repeating what many people have discovered I'm cheerful about it because it is the Fulfillment of Prophecy and when prophecy is fulfilled it tells me who is in control who's in control God is in control and as it fulfills I know I'm going home soon and the sooner the better get on with it finish it so that\n\n(1:01:05) we can go home No More Tears no more crying no more crime No More Death no more rape no more terrible things that happened to little children all of it gone no more keys No More anything wow that'll be just great it seems to be play this is Justice William M oon O Douglas it seems to be plain that by these laws\n\n(1:01:32) the states compel one under sanction of law to refrain from work or Recreation on Sunday because of the majority's view on that day the state by law makes Sunday a symbol of respect or adherence Pat Robertson said the next obligation that a citizen of God's world order owes to is to himself remember the Sabbath\n\n(1:01:54) day to keep it holy is a demand for the personal benefit of each citizen higher civilizations rise when people can rest and draw inspiration from God laws in America that mandated the day of rest Sunday laws have been nullified as a violation of separation of church and state as an outright insult to God oh\n\n(1:02:17) isn't that interesting and his plan only those policies that can be shown to have a clearly secular purpose are recognized so what is he saying forget about that stupid Constitution that separates church and state let's do something else let get church and state together can you see an image of the Beast arising\n\n(1:02:38) here wow this is fascinating stuff so church and state will work together and legislate laws which will honor the first Beast who changed the Sabbath to Sunday the Roman Catholic church if they enforce Sunday who will they be honoring Rome they will be honoring Rome and then Sunday times 57 1998 Pope\n\n(1:03:05) launches crusade to save Sunday make it clear that Sunday must not be worked since it must be celebrated as the day of our Lord he brought out a whole encyclical I'm just going to Breeze through it he says it's tradition they celebrate the Eucharist he talks about an encyclical rum novarum and he asks for laws\n\n(1:03:31) legislating respect their duty to keep Sunday holy ask for civil legislating legislation which will enable us to keep Sunday now the United States should say our Constitution forbids this I'm terribly sorry Mr Pope but church and state are separate we cannot concur did they do that no here's the St statement there is Bush just after he\n\n(1:04:00) became president he cut the ribbon to this new Museum this multi million Roman Catholic Museum and he says the best way to honor Pope John Paul 2 truly one of the Great Men is to take his teachings seriously is to listen to his words and put his words and teachings into action here in America and that's the highest official\n\n(1:04:22) in the government saying let's listen to the pope is that removing the separation between church and state yes or no absolutely this is a challenge we must accept I have a problem with you Mr President you are speaking like a dragon isn't he absolutely is he fulfilling prophecy yes or am I angry with him no please that he's there and\n\n(1:04:48) can fulfill the prophecy because that means we can go home he exercises all the power of the first Beast has he got power to tell Nations and individuals what to do yes or no absolutely and causes the Earth and then that dwell there in to worship the first priest you better obey that system whose deadly wound was healed rub two\n\n(1:05:10) religions up long enough and one will rise like a mushroom to defend itself right the unrestrained freedom of thinking and of openly making knowns one's thoughts is inherent in the rights of citizens and is by no means to be reckoned worthy of favor and support Pope Gregory you're not allowed to tell\n\n(1:05:31) what you are thinking anymore that's what the pope said Pope Gregory said that fascinating stuff is America beginning to say the same things hasn't the President says those that say such and such and such and such are the new terrorists you better not say anything against us or else did he say that oh yes he's saying the same\n\n(1:05:55) thing interesting and we've seen this one if we gain sufficient numerical majority in this country religious freedom is at an end Bishop of St Louis November 23 1851 religious freedom is rapidly coming to an end there was a Sunday law in the past on the venerable day of the sun let the magistrates and people residing in\n\n(1:06:16) the cities rest and let all workshops be closed that was the addict of Constantine Christians shall not jiz now this is the fascinating part you know if the world makes a national Sunday law and says there you go Everybody Must rest on Sunday I will say okay that's fair enough I don't care give me one\n\n(1:06:40) more day off if they say everybody must keep Wednesday and Thursday and Friday as well I'll say well that's great now I can stay home all week you know what I mean but there's something else to this law look what this law also said besides not working on Sunday what did it say Christians shall not jize they may not keep the\n\n(1:07:03) Sabbath and be idle on Saturday aha so the law must say something more it must prevent me from obeying God interesting but shall work on that day but the Lord's day they shall especially honor now the same happened with Pharaoh Pharaoh issued a decree and uh Moses came up to pharaoh and said this is not going to happen and Pharaoh\n\n(1:07:33) said to him you Moses you make the people rest and the word rest that is used there in the Old Testament is shabat you make the people Shabbat keep the Sabbath I am telling you to your Works increase their labor no more straw gathering for them let them work so what law did Pharaoh made make he made an\n\n(1:07:59) anti- Sabbath law so did Constantine make an anti- Sabbath law at the same time it was a pro Sunday law yes but that's not the important thing for me the important thing here is that he forbade one to not work on a Sabbath and Pharaoh did the same thing now what was God's response to Pharaoh when Pharaoh said I am going to force\n\n(1:08:28) you to work on the Sabbath day what happened plagues came and sorted him out now the Bible says there will be plagues at the end of time to sort such a power out right or wrong the parallels are absolutely fantastic from the apostles time until the Council of laia which was 364 the holy observation of the Jew Sabbath\n\n(1:08:56) continued as may be proved out of many authors yay not withstanding the decree of the council against it so the early Christians ignored the papal decrees that the Sabbath was kept not withstanding the decree of the council against it it's also seen the fact that Pope Gregory I wrote against the Roman\n\n(1:09:13) citizens forbid any work done on the Sabbath day that means Sunday people were working on it so the early church kept the Saturday now here's an interesting decree issued by the first Beast this is the Roman Catholic Church at the Senate of tulo in ad. 11163 they issued the following decree the bishop and Priests take care and to\n\n(1:09:40) forbid under pain of excommunication every person from presuming to give reception or at least assistance to the following of this heresy which was Sabbath keeping this was the decree against the valenzas who chose biblically to keep the Sabbath of the Lord so the pope said heresy this will not happen wherever they shall be\n\n(1:10:03) discovered neither were they to have any dealings with them in buying and selling oops so the first Beast issued a decree that those who kept the Sabbath would receive economic boycott no buying or selling that being so deprived of the common assistance of Life they might be compelled to repent of the evil of their\n\n(1:10:22) way whoever shall dare to contravene this order let them be excommunicated as a partner with them in guilt as many of them as can be found let them be imprisoned by the Catholic prin princes and punished with a forfeiture of all their substance that was a Roman Catholic decree you cannot buy and sell if you\n\n(1:10:43) continue Sabbath keeping and we will take everything you own away and then did they listen the valenzas no so what was the next thing that then happened happen King ID alonsus of Aragon banished all the valenzas in n in 1194 as a consequence and then they sent in the military and they decimated them\n\n(1:11:09) they killed them so there was a Sunday law there was an anti- Sabbath law included in that and there was no buying and selling and a death decree that's what the first Beast did do you think the second beast might become like the first one do you think it's possible do you think the image might do the same\n\n(1:11:32) thing well it just said so all businesses here Harold lindel editor of Christianity Today all businesses including gasoline stations and restaurants should close every Sunday by force of legislative fear through the duly elected officials of the people so they're asking for the same thing the Bible predicts a coming Confederacy of\n\n(1:11:52) religions in America attempting to unit church and state and the people must be whipped up into a religious fervor by a outpouring of a spirit with signs and wonders which will make them convinced that God is with the movement does that make sense it's scary H I think it's scary so the coming crisis is similar to\n\n(1:12:20) that which was in the day of Daniel the Babylonian King a powerful world leader established a of each image and compelled worship contrary to God's command and the worthies they refus to bow down to the image and as a consequence there were major problems Daniel 3:15 says how this religious ceremony was conducted now\n\n(1:12:50) when you hear the sound of what does it say all kinds of music if you are ready to fall down and worship the image I made very good but if you do not worship it you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace do you think music could be important in whipping up a religious fervor what about all kinds of music\n\n(1:13:16) what would that include that would include light pop music that would include for those that love it beautiful opera music that would include heavy rock that would include heavy metal that would include all kinds of things don't you think as long as the people accept the religious fervor who cares music will play a very prominent\n\n(1:13:42) role do you know that the Bible repeats that three times as if the Lord is really trying to say something well let's have a look what happened when the pope visited St Louis and the youth was filling the chamber and two monks out here I think these look like franciscans according to their dress they said at last we have Unity\n\n(1:14:10) Unity peace peace on Earth now what does the Bible say when they start saying what peace peace then we have a problem and then as the pope comes in you will see the young people go he St all kinds of music is being used to satisfy the hunger of all their souls from beautiful choir music by ecumenical\n\n(1:14:39) choirs of all religions singing together to pop music with arms rising and nuns waving their arms and the youth to heavy Rock by DC Talk and bands like that as the pope comes in then we have dancing in the Lord and all these F features and the Roman Catholic priest is speaking to one of the U DJs there\n\n(1:15:08) and he says the the DJ asks him or the the reporter asked the Roman Catholic priest do you think there is any religion in this loud music and uh the priest says of course music is God is in all the great music music systems of the world the great music of the reformation and this music well the young people understand it\n\n(1:15:33) that's good enough well let's watch and see what happens it was great a great feeling excit of Peace unity love peace love and unity Unity Unity yes all nations will all nations will come before you oh Lord and worship before you [Music] now all the nations bowed [Music] down next Nation [Music] in well in this video clip I only showed\n\n(1:16:55) you the Nations coming I can't show you the whole thing we'll be here all day but representatively all the nations in every corner came and bowed down to the Pope the music and the other issues which I mentioned set the stage for the young people and for the older people I'll be showing you that clip in another\n\n(1:17:14) lecture as we continue along this interesting path so the world is ready to accept this Authority but the Bible says in Romans 616 know ye not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey he servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness so if we obey this system\n\n(1:17:40) and they've asked for laws the papacy has asked for laws and the president of the United States says as you exalt we will listen we must introduce this into the United States the churches are clamoring for legisl ation regarding the law of God but Jesus says come and follow me now this is the basis of Revelation\n\n(1:18:03) chapter 13 Revelation chapter 13 describes the two political Powers which in essence control the world at the End of Time the one in the Middle Ages totally Catholic the other one now representing protestantism and doing exactly the of the first Beast has protestantism protestantism totally changed or has protestantism being\n\n(1:18:34) infiltrated that is a good question now we will still have to see and we'll have to do a lecture to find out where protestantism has been infiltrated and whether the great Protestant preachers really are what they say they are we will also have to look at this fire this outpouring of the spirit of God in\n\n(1:18:55) adverted commas which is flooding the United States of the world and not only the United States but the entire world through the media is it the right one or is it not the right one and what must be our criteria the word of God that's all we have so you will see there are some lectures coming which are\n\n(1:19:22) called that all may be one and Strange Fire don't miss those lectures they're going to be very very revealing and we will paint in this picture and we will see that God has predicted 100% what was going to happen on this planet and that is why I can lift up my head and be pleased because God is in control Jesus is going to be\n\n(1:19:49) the ultimate Victor thank you n [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh

  "# Title:219_the_wine_of_babylon_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nPagan Origins,Babylonian System,Counterfeit Christianity,Papacy's Role,Sun Worship\n\n## Guide:\nThis source dissects the concept of \"Babylon\" as a spiritual system, asserting that its false doctrines and pagan origins are deeply embedded within modern Catholicism. The speaker argues that this \"Babylonian Trinity\"â€”comprising Satan (the dragon), organized religion (the beast, specifically the Papacy), and those who apostatize (the false prophet)â€”mirrors ancient idolatry, particularly Sun worship and mother-child veneration, disguised with Christian names and rituals. By meticulously detailing historical connections between pagan symbols, practices, and Catholic traditions, the source aims to expose what it calls a deceiving system that ultimately leads people away from true biblical teachings and toward a counterfeit faith, urging individuals to flee out of the midst of Babylon and choose to serve God alone.\n\n## Content:\n(2) Total Onslaught 219 The Wine of Babylon Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-gP0oGHw1k\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] the line of Babylon so let's have a look at why the system is called Babylon and what is the prominent role that the beast power which we have sadly identified as the papacy plays in this Babylonian Trinity we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto you do well to take heed as unto a light that shine a--the\n\n(01:35) in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your heart 2nd Peter 1:19 we have to diligently study the prophecies we have to know what's going on behind the scenes we have to know why and wherefore God says things Jeremiah 51 6 and 7 speaking about literal Babylon says flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver\n\n(02:02) every man he soul now the type literal Babylon is our listen book to tell us why God calls the endtime Confederacy also Babylon be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the Lord's vengeance he will render unto her a recompense so this system is a deceiving system it has a false religion\n\n(02:35) and leads people to perdition Babylon has been a golden cup in the Lord's hand that made all the earth drunken the nation's have drunken her why and therefore the nation's are mad in other words the nation's that drink the wine of Babylon they go crazy wine in the Bible knife Jesus is the vine then the wine\n\n(03:03) that comes forth from the vine must be what he says must be his fruit must be the doctrines so Babylon has false doctrines now we're not going to deal with all the false doctrines tonight we're going to look at why the Bible defines the system is Babylon and we're going to go to ancient Babylon in order to do that that is why it is\n\n(03:29) called Babel because the Lord confused the language of the whole world Genesis 11 7 to 9 this has been a thorn in the devil side ever since that time when they were building the Tower of Babel in order to unite in apostasy towards God because God had said he will never destroy the world by a flood again they\n\n(03:54) still built a tower in case he tried something like that in the future so God separated the nations and then he's something that was essential for our salvation because by separating the nations this constant tension on this planet would lead people to seek God because if you are threatened by one or\n\n(04:20) the other you seek God and God can stay in the minds of men the devil doesn't like the separation and he wants one unitary system whereby all will worship Him and they followed another angel saying this is now the book revelation Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all the nations\n\n(04:46) drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication revelation 14 8 so in other words here you have a system that he's selling wine that is full of fornication that is apostasy towards God now if you are a pasta sizing towards God who are you serving in the other one the other one and he also has a gob he also has a\n\n(05:13) gob he presents himself either in this form or in that form or whatever form he wants to present himself but whatever form it is it's not God's Way it's his way so here is a false system that has been set up now revelation 1619 tells us and the great city referring to spiritual Babylon it cannot be ancient Babylon\n\n(05:38) because God said ancient Babylon would never be rebuilt so that serves as a type and a type by definition is always smaller than the anti-type the lamb stands for Jesus Christ so the lamb is just a small example of the greater more prominent anti-type which is Christ himself Babylon the type stands for those who\n\n(06:07) would apostasy against God and in a larger on a larger scale at the end of time it represents all those who in Confederacy work together to oppose God Jerusalem served as a type as all of those who would seek God and seek salvation through the lamb so that's typology so here we have this great city was divided into three parts\n\n(06:36) so now we know Babylon has three components are we gonna deal with all three of them in this lecture series don't miss any of this and the cities of the nation's fell in all the great Babylon came into the remembrance before God to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath so if you\n\n(06:54) stay in Babylon then you're gonna have to deal with this side of the issue God will recompense and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs this is heavy the spirit that actuate spab elan consists of unclean spirits and they came out of the mouth of the Dragon that Satan himself because the Bible defines the\n\n(07:20) dragon is Satan in Revelation chapter 12 and out of the mouth of the Beast Revelation tells us about the Beast and we've already dealt with it in great detail the little horn power of Daniel chapter 7 and the Beast out of the sea Revelation chapter 13 and we sadly had to identify it as the pipe see and out of the mouth of the false\n\n(07:44) prophet you know in the other languages this comes out a little bit better if you take it in the German then it is rockin destructions rockin this theaters month this fights and profiting do you know what that means there's a harsher word and a softer word for the word mouth and the dragon and the beast get\n\n(08:08) the harsh harsher word and the false prophet gets the sadder now now the false prophet are all those who once had the truth but returned back to the mother system for they are the spirits of Devil's working miracles and we looked at miracles last night and these miracles will deceive people which go\n\n(08:36) forth unto the kings of the earth that's the political systems of the world of how much of the world the whole world to gather them to the Battle of the great day of God Almighty so the conflict is going to be between this false trinity and the people of God those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the\n\n(08:58) testimony of Jesus so mystic Babylon consists of the dragon component the dragon Satan working directly with man that would be spiritism strange occurrences appearances all of those spiritualistic activities the beast organized religion culminating in the papacy and the false prophet those who once knew but are returning to false\n\n(09:31) prophecies we are told by Eusebius that Constantine in order to recommend the new religion to the heathen transferred into it the outward ornaments to which there had been accustomed in their own development of Christian doctrine and the evidence points out the fact that Christianity early on was paganized\n\n(09:54) just took on the garb of Christianity and this is derived according to the writings of the secret societies it can be traced all the way back to Simon Magus Simon Magus followed Peter and Paul to Rome and he was a magician he was a pagan priest who put on a cloak of Christianity because he wanted to have\n\n(10:24) that power and Peter rebuked him and this Simon Magus by the way the name Simon also means Peter he followed them to Rome and this occults mixture between paganism and Christianity finds its seat in him he was the Petra PTR and the Petra Peters have nothing to do with Simon Peter the postel but have to do\n\n(10:52) with Simon Magus I know that after I leave savage wolves will come in among stew and will not spare the flock even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them the teachings of Magus of Simon Magus having come from Samaria were cabbalistic in nature and\n\n(11:17) out of Cabell ISM comes Gnosticism and Gnosticism is the teaching that the Messiah is the Osiris of old so the ancient Egyptian mythology which come from the Book of the Dead which come from Thutmose's the third who was the very Pharaoh who clashed with Moses who was the high priest of our cult ISM and\n\n(11:42) paganism this religion of Osiris and Isis the goddess this how shall we say this anthropomorphic human input into this religion and androgenic worship because the deities were both male and female and they were interchangeable this religion is what was brought in to Christianity now the ancient gods if we want to find\n\n(12:15) the thread into modern Babylon we'll have to look at ancient Babylon the Chaldeans worshipped bell or Merida and then there was nanus the Sun and the Sun was also worshiped as Tammuz and the women of Israel were very apt to weep for Tammuz because he was a artificial account to feed Messiah the devil had\n\n(12:44) the Messiah prepared before the real one so that people would not accept the real one how do we know Jesus is the real one you remember the prophecy we dealt with do you remember the prophecy on the Messiah the 70 week prophecy whether a beniker says that you are cursed your hand or your finger your wrist your arm\n\n(13:05) that you are cursed if you should number the 70 weeks because it identifies the real Messiah spot on so the counterfeit Messiah who was already there and he was Tamils then there was the goddess Rhea she was also worshipped as Ishta from which we have the word Easter today a starter Balthus and she was the Queen of\n\n(13:31) Heaven she was the queen of heaven and she was known as the Roth subduer now in Catholicism we have exactly the same thing it is stated nobody comes to the Father except through Jesus but nobody comes to Jesus except through Mary and Mary is the Mediatrix she is the Roth subduer so we have a similar system to\n\n(13:55) what we had here in Babylonian times now if you take these religions and you look at them on a worldwide basis in Egypt these deities were worshipped as Isis the goddess and a son of Cyrus and Osiris was the one who died became part of the son was resurrected and came back to this earth as Horus Horace the divine child and the Divine\n\n(14:23) Mother Isis so you have mother and child worship in India they were worshipped as EC and is whare it's the same religion in fact the Babylonian religion is today the universal religion of all the religious systems China it was Shing mu and the holy mother and son in Greece Cirrus and Irene and Plutus in Rome it\n\n(14:49) was Fortuna and Jupiter pure this was the ancient system of worship it's interesting that in the latest seminar taking place about Christianity in the world today the so-called Jesus Seminar where they are speaking about a new Reformation god forbid that we should call it a Reformation where they talk about a\n\n(15:14) Reformation and want to put Jesus on a par with a Cyrus I have a problem with that because the one is the counterfeit of the other and the religious doctrines associated with the Book of the Dead which concerns a Cyrus is totally the opposite of what the Bible says well Ezekiel 816 says that the door of\n\n(15:36) the temple of the Lord between the porch and the altar were about five and 20 men with their backs towards the temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east and they worshipped the Sun towards the east so ancient Israel although they knew God and knew the power of God were already diverted towards this pagan ism\n\n(15:57) I'll tell you why because it's a very sophisticated religion don't underestimate paganism we think these peoples were were silly or stupid because they worship pagan gods we're no less stupid did you know that most of my life I serve pagan gods didn't even know it didn't even know it but that's the fact\n\n(16:20) so they worship the Sun because Sun worship is a perfect counterfeit of Messianic worship so in other words it's easy to substitute the one for the other put him in the right garb and apply the right liturgy and you've got a religion now the religion comes from the legend of Nimrod and Semiramis Nimrod was a\n\n(16:50) warrior against the Lord and he was the one who have pasta sized and then he was put to death and his widows Semiramis claimed that he had been resurrected or had take been taken up to the Sun and had been reborn through her and as the fish swims in the waters of the Euphrates so the fish symbol became the\n\n(17:19) symbol of the God that protected Nimrod in this transition and then she gave birth to the child who was of course the birth the rebirth the resurrection if you like in a child of a cyrus in scandinavia they were worshiped as Frigga and Balder venus and adonis in wrong and Ashtoreth and ball in Phoenicia and a child became the sin\n\n(17:47) bearer and became the savior and this was his name he was called solo hasta by the way Zorro asterism is alive and well and living in the Middle East it is the seed of the woman Mithras the Savior Mitra ISM is one of the most sophisticated forms of Sun worship and we will be dealing with Mitra ISM because it is astounding who\n\n(18:16) Mitra was and what Mitra ISM is today even here in the United States you'll be surprised how much Mitra ISM there is Dionysius is the sin bearer Bacchus the branch vishna the victim man Osiris King and Kings do you recognize those titles those are all titles that belong to Jesus Christ and they have been captured\n\n(18:44) by these pagan deities now if you were a priest of the pagan deities then you worship this deity in many many forms one of the most prominent forms was in the form of the God Dagon and the priests to dug on dug on on his the Egyptian for God dug his fish says the fish form of this God the priests wore the fish mightor on the\n\n(19:15) head and they had a complete fish cloak and the fish in ancient Egypt and impacting religions becomes the symbol of Dagon in this particular Egyptian one you have the horns of the bull the bull the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet was the symbol of the bull in in the east it was the Alpha the LF the\n\n(19:40) elephant the elephant becomes the bull of the east and these creatures become symbols of the Sun God therefore you have bull worship and you have elephant worship and the horns that were between the eyes of the bull also auras are a symbol of the half moon the sickle moon which becomes a symbol of the womb of\n\n(20:04) the woman which receives the rebirth of the Sun God so later on that became a little bit more sophisticated and the priests of Dagon who wore the fish mitre and the cloak and then later on they substituted the fish cloak for colorful robes normally in the colors crimson which is the colour of sacrifice purple\n\n(20:29) which is the color of royalty now do you recognize that sort of mitre on the top there do people wear it today in another form yes they do well let's go and see if we can find it really in the ancient Babylonian finds yes we can this one here comes from the Pergamon museum I took this one myself there you have the\n\n(20:55) symbol of the Sun and the wavy lines by the way wavy lines emanating from the Sun or the sign of the female symbol straight lines are the sign of the male symbol through the union of the male and female deity you had the birth of the savior and here you have priests of Dagon walking around with pails over there containing holy\n\n(21:22) water and they would have little brushes which were made from hyssop and then they would sprinkle the people to wash them is that a ritual that is practiced today yes very much so here you have a priest a high priest of Dagon there you had the symbol in the sky of the God shamash who is the symbol of the deity he has the wings normally\n\n(21:50) the wings of an eagle and then you have the solar symbol in the middle there's another solar symbol which is two stars superimposed over each other making eight spokes so you make a solar wheel of eight spokes and if you were the high priest then you had to bow down to the high priest or if you were the\n\n(22:11) representative or the God himself and you had to often kiss the ring and kiss the slipper now if we go to Rome this is the pantheon outside Rome and this is the place where all the deities of ancient times were worshipped and outside you have this little statue over here where you have a cuboid down there\n\n(22:37) which is also a symbol of paganism by the way then you have the LF standing at the bottom symbol of the Sun God then you have the Stella which is the symbol of the phallic symbol of a cyrus because when Isis put him back together again this is one of the parts she had to reconstruct and on top of that you have\n\n(23:01) the symbol of the cross and we'll deal with that a little bit later if you go into the pantheon you have interesting little things on the floor you squares the pagan deities were either in a square or they were represented in a circle so you have circles and you have squares and because they were both good\n\n(23:23) and evil representing both shapes therefore you had black and white squares now if we go to Roman Catholic churches you will find and cathedrals you'll find the fish over there this is the the ancient goddess Astarte there's the fish mightor with a symbol of the star or the Sun and the half moon over there and then you\n\n(23:49) have a whole plethora of pagan symbols in the hand many of which are used today this one is used by the medical world that one up there is very interesting here's a fish for example this comes out of Hinduism as a symbol of the pagan deity there was the goddess iris and here you have some interesting\n\n(24:08) symbols on the mitre of the Pope there you have the symbol of the Sun God that's the one of the main symbols of the Sun deity with a fall and the force blokes within a circle and that over there is a cross which is known as the Maltese Cross and the Knights of Malta who wear that particular cross and we\n\n(24:35) will see that that particular cross look at it carefully is a direct symbol of the Sun deity it's got nothing to do with Christianity well let's go there here is one of the kings of ancient times and this is an Assyrian King Sargon what has he got around his neck can you see it this is in the British Museum there you\n\n(25:00) have the Maltese Cross which is the same cross that the Pope has on his side and he's pointing here with his finger like this which is also a symbol of the one meaning the one deity the number one the one stands for the Sun God there you have the symbol which we just saw on the mitre of the Pope symbol of the Sun God\n\n(25:24) there's another symbol you have the compass the set square and the compass which you find in Freemasonry over there you have the half moon with a sickle in it which you find in many religions there you have the multi-layered one as you find in the Aztec religions of Sun worship and there you have the triple\n\n(25:41) mitre the three aspects of the Sun God those are some of the main symbols of Sun worship as you find them in ancient times where do you think we'll find them most prominently today probably in the papacy well all of these are wearing fish miters those are my toes of Doug on let's go to Basilica San Clemente one of\n\n(26:07) the churches in Rome let's go down to the bottom you will find that they used an altar which on the one side was inscribed with Christianized symbols and on the other had petroglyphs of pagan Sun worship so both religions worshiped in the same capacity used the same venues switch the altars and eventually\n\n(26:31) they fused into one church history tells us Christianity became the established religion of the Roman Empire and took the place of paganism Christianity as it existed in the Dark Ages might be turned to baptize paganism it's very interesting let's see what a what the Roman Catholic Church has to say about\n\n(26:53) this the story of American Catholicism page 37 it has often been charged that Catholicism is overlaid with many pagan encrustations Catholicism is ready to accept that accusation and even to make it her boast the Great God pan is not really dead he's baptized uh-huh so paganism is within the church and the\n\n(27:21) real deity behind the scenes that his worship is not Jesus Christ but is a cyrus in whatever form is in the form of pan you would find him in the Groves he was the god of the Groves he was the god of fear that's where the way panic comes from and this God pan is the one that is worshipped either as a beautiful young\n\n(27:46) man who wears and carries the Sheep as the shepherd or he is worshipped as the one with a goats feet depending which aspect you are looking at because whether you worship Him in his positive sense or whether you worship him in his negative sense it's the same deity it's the same whether you worship Lucifer or\n\n(28:08) whether you worship is a good sight the dark and the light are one and the same deity well let me take you to this very prominent Roman Catholic cathedral and I was looking for these symbols in this Roman Catholic cathedral in the south of Germany and here I found what they call the Statue of David and see it over\n\n(28:31) there with the Sheep carrying the Sheep around his neck and I was wondering whether that was a representation of David or whether it was a representation of the other one well it's not too difficult to tell because what has he got in his hand he's carrying the pan-flute now did David ever play the pan-flute yes or no\n\n(28:53) no David didn't carry the pan-flute he had to hop the hand hop so this instrument tells me that this is pan and not the other one then I was interested having seen pan over here whether I would find pan in his negative form in the same construction in the same building and sure enough there is this pan with the goats feet and all the\n\n(29:19) other symbols of paganism including Yanis the two-headed one so this is paganism in its highest form if we go to some John's Lateran which is the church where the papacy speaks ex cathedra or if you go to st. Peters the whole system of the year the whole construction is a system of pagan Sun worship the site is\n\n(29:44) the ancient site by the way most of the cathedrals in the world are built on the very ancient pagan sites where the ancient deities were worshiped the construction of these buildings are also in accordance with the ancient pagan rites so here you have the triangle for example you have the famous sundown and\n\n(30:08) you have this pillared structure which is normally known as the seat of the goddess and if you enter into this place on the floor you will find the official title of the papacy which is pontifex maximus now this title comes all the way from Babylon it has been changed through time when metre Persia took over the\n\n(30:33) meter Persians took over the religion the same religious system the priests of babylon revolted at some stage were driven out and fled to pergamus and there the Pontic King Pontifex Maximus resided until Roman times when he gave his title his vestments and all the powers of deity as well as a high priest to the\n\n(31:02) Emperor and that's why Roman emperors got the title Pontifex Maximus and when Rome declined and the seat of the Caesar was empty the Bishop of Rome claimed the title Pontifex Maximus which means the bridge builder he's the bridge between heaven and earth so he takes the place of Jesus Christ who is the bridge\n\n(31:25) between heaven and earth and if we want to see whether we find any of the interesting symbols this is on the floor of the Vatican what do we have over there they we have the triple crown where do we see that it's a symbol of the ancient religion that we saw there associated with the babylonian system\n\n(31:44) and the assyrian kings here you have another interesting symbol that's the lion with eagle's wings what is the Bible define letters defines that is Babylon then you have the fleur-de-lis which is the symbol of the union of the male and the female deities and then you have the split-tail which is the symbol\n\n(32:03) of Dagon you have them all right over there you even have the pagan seat which they claim is Peter see now in order to qualify for salvation you have to enter in through the door notice how this is all based on the truth because the devil is counterfeiting the truth Christ says I am the door nobody comes to the Father\n\n(32:29) except through me in paganism there are three doors a large one smaller one and a medium one a baby one the one standing for the male deity the female deity and the child deity so you have father mother son if you like well here you have that in the ancient bolivian culture there was a typical son door\n\n(32:53) there's the symbol of the sun god at the top and here you have the three holy stones or rocks in the footing Magaro see sure that is in Japan and the one would be the father the mother and the son and on top of it yours have the portal of the divine couple the door the Sun door leading inside also in\n\n(33:21) Fatima Guerra you have the bronze frogs which also a form of the deity because it's a form of pantheism God is in everything and you also had the frogs of course in Egypt so these religions are not dead they're alive and well here you have the winged thunder of sending the do our mosque in the Hindu system so\n\n(33:41) Hinduism the ancient religions the Eastern religions they all have the Sun doors of Babylon now who would you expect if he was going to become the high priest of Babylon in our time to be associated with Sun doors today wouldn't you expect the papacy if the Bible is correct to have the same thing well\n\n(34:04) there you have it jubilee john paul ii blesses the holy door on New Year's Day where in the Bible you read about a holy door you read about it day anyway Jesus says I am the door I am the way come through me but here you use the symbol in a totally different sense by the way every single Peggle incrustation that\n\n(34:28) you can possibly think of is right here on this outfit that he is wearing well the papacy also claims that he has the keys and he calls them the keys of Peter they are the Petrakis because there they are in Babylon with a lion God the keys to heaven and to hell do you remember that he said that the sentence of the\n\n(34:52) priests is preeminent and that God has to subscribe to it so it is the system that determines whether you go to heaven or whether you are lost and not God now there you have another symbol of the lion guard over there in ancient times so the keys are a symbol of the line interesting stuff that this lion God is\n\n(35:15) wearing or carrying all these ancient deities and the high priests of these deities carry such stuffs with a pinecone on the top because the pinecones a symbol of fertility so now if we go into the rituals of how they treated the high priest who was a reincarnation just like the Pharaoh of a cyrus and\n\n(35:39) therefore a representative of Osiris in the form of Horus if you like on this earth in the ancient cultures they were carried normally in a stool like this and associated with it you had fans which consisted of feathers they could be peacock feathers and the eye on the peacock feather is the eye of the\n\n(36:02) all-wise one of the deity they worshipped or it could be ostrich feathers because the feather is associated with the bird which in the final analysis leads us back to the Phoenix but we'll come to that a little bit later now there's the papacy and here you have papaya store being carried around in this very fashion exactly like in pagan\n\n(36:25) times with exactly the same rituals with the twin keys which come from Babylon the hand signals that are being used here are very interesting because they are all pagan Sun worship systems if you take the the dances of the Hindus the hand signals they use everyone is meticulously practiced because it has a\n\n(36:47) meaning in terms of Sun worship now there's a triple crown which you would find stems from paganism with which the papacy is install though the Pope is crowned here the crown is being brought they are the twin tails at the back Cardinals lying down while this takes place here you can see the ordination of\n\n(37:13) new bishops and Cardinals look at them lying down exactly as it was in pagan times here you have a triple tiara of the pagan God 1800 BC note the triple crown one two three and there you have the horn tiara of the Assyrian winged God they have the Triple Crown in Krishna which is Hinduism so the Triple Crown is a symbol of the\n\n(37:42) ancient religion of Babylon there you have the winged bull cherub also with the triple crown stemming from Assyrian times Babylonian times so the one who is the Triple Crown now is the high priests of the ancient deities here's the tiara of pub Sixtus they are six serpents beneath the occult pyramid on this one\n\n(38:10) now let's look at mother and child worship Mary and the Child Jesus the symbol is exactly the same as you have in paganism and it's interesting that you have black Madonna's and you have white Madonna's you have black Jesus and white Jesus now in paganism it was exactly the same a cyrus was either worshiped as black or\n\n(38:41) he was worshiped as white depending on what aspect of the deity you favoured in the game of chess what do you have there you have black and white squares and the game of chess is designed it's a no ancient occult game designed through Freemasonry to show that the porn even the pawn can overthrow the king and\n\n(39:08) outmaneuver him in fact you can exchange the King for the female form of the deity and become the queen if you like so black and white was a symbol that was already present in Osiris worship and in Isis worship and you have it in Catholicism as well you have the black madonna and you have the white madonna\n\n(39:32) if you go to Eastern culture you have exactly the same mother and child worship EC and is whare Shing mu and the Holy Child there you have it in in Egypt Isis and Osiris or the birth of Horus there you have it in the Hittite culture mother and child worship of course mother and child will become prominent in Roman Catholicism but if\n\n(39:57) you want to make people believe that it stands for something else you change the name of the deities it's no problem they've been changing throughout history the Greeks didn't have the same names as the medo-persians they didn't have the same names as the Egyptians they didn't have the same names as the Babylonians but it was one\n\n(40:16) in the same deity because the attributes the character was identical black Madonna's in the Roman Catholic Church and and black messiahs very common and white Madonna's and white children here you have it in Hinduism this comes from the British Museum there you have the mother and there you have the Holy Child the one\n\n(40:43) who will be the savior this is paganism this has nothing to do with Christianity because Jesus says there is one mediator between man and God and who's that the man Christ Jesus you don't have another mediator there is no Mary to take a place or any other saint or anyone who can act as mediator this is paganism but it's not\n\n(41:07) Christianity and here you have the symbols the ancient pagan symbols of Hermes and Isis right here with the six pointed star in the middle of the circle or the five-pointed stars in other places are also used this symbol where do you think I found this the symbol of the ancient gods I found this in the\n\n(41:30) Jesuit Cathedral in the south of Europe in southern Germany what is that doing there but what are these symbols of Sun worship been doing in check of one in Czechoslovakia or in Poland all over the world well let's have a look at what the new insight Catholic Encyclopedia says Pius the 12th affirmed strongly the\n\n(41:55) queenship of Mary and I have a queen in heaven but meltus was called the Queen in heaven inserting in the calendar for May 31 a new feast of Mary Queen so Mary is remodeled and reshaped to fit into the shoes of the ancient deity and placed in front of the people as the new mediator that's pretty sad because Jesus\n\n(42:20) is taken out of the equation Pius the 12th consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary so this is not consecration to Christ I'm not knocking Mary Mary was a was a blessed woman she was a good woman but her heritage is being misused here and she was revered then as mother and Queen October 31 1942\n\n(42:44) as a public recognition of a queenship it's amazing that the ancient full complete system of Babylonian worship only really came to full fruition in our time now let's have a look at some of these fascinating portrayals of transference of the mediatorial road from Jesus to Mary this one I found at gar Capuchin Rome\n\n(43:12) here you have Jesus placing the crown of thorns on Mary's head and she has the wounds in her hands so Mary is the one that becomes the mediator the one who suffered and died and it is claimed that through Mary we are saved because Mary is the one who through her obedience redeemed us whereas Eve fail now this\n\n(43:44) ancient goddess she was part of a fertility Rite and people would pray to her for fertility and for nurturing so does Mary fulfill the same row absolutely let's go to the mock grotto la grotta do lay in Bethlehem very close to the Church of the Nativity and let me take you down there into the mock grotto\n\n(44:12) here you have a symbol it's in the church I know it looks a bit funny and I apologize but this is the picture that they use as an icon Mary with a bracelet symbol of fertility where she feeds this child and people come to this grotto in their hord's to pray for fertility problems now if you look on the ceilings\n\n(44:38) of the cave you find these white splotches and it's called the milk grotto because it states that these white splotches that you find over here or the milk of Mary because when she fed the baby Jesus her look squirted against the walls of the of the cave and made those white splotches this is what it\n\n(44:58) says there and this has been authenticated by the papacy and there is a testimony from the Vatican that this is an authentic miracle situation now I asked the the the guide there who happened to be also the Cantore of the Church of the Nativity that's the one the big one where all the trouble is in Israel now the Cantor himself I asked\n\n(45:27) him excuse me I'm just a little bit curious these white splotches that we see against the walls I've seen them in all the other caves as well are they also the milk of Mary oh no no those are natural but these come from the milk of Mary you see now this might sound a bit ridiculous but I'm just showing you that the same\n\n(45:53) fertility cults surrounding this ancient deity is also ascribed to Mary and actually when you think about it it's quite sick now if she's queen in heaven that means she is the goddess of heaven now Mary the Queen of Heaven here you have a Catholic picture where angels are crowning Mary as Queen here you have on\n\n(46:20) an entrance in another Cathedral in Europe you have Mary being crowned by the father and the son as Queen of Heaven while the worship is at the bottom are not worshipping either the font father nor the son but their homage is towards Mary here's another one with Jesus looking on giving his sanction while the ark angels are crowning Mary\n\n(46:50) here you have another crowning of father and son crowning Mary direct so now it's not an angel it's father and son direct and here you have the Pope praying in front of a statue of Mary and here you have him crowning Mary so you have the whole ritual you have the whole system of paganism built-in over here to make\n\n(47:15) Mary belters the Queen of Heaven the Roth subduer the one who stands in the place of the real mediator so if you have this picture over here you have the Holy Spirit and above there you have Mary in the center and if you look at the disciples eyes where they directed up there or - Mary - Mary so she has\n\n(47:41) become the mediator now do we find the symbol in ancient times absolutely this female deity was also worshipped as the Dove and there you have the double dot which was also a symbol two headed one which can likely also be interpreted as a two-headed Phoenix or a two-headed Eagle which is an interesting symbol of\n\n(48:09) Freemasonry by the way and here you have the symbol of you know the doubt here you have the symbol of you know which is a symbol used by the United Nations for peace here is another one of the Dove symbol of you know and the Dove represents the gentler force and takes the place of the Holy Spirit so the female deity is also the\n\n(48:36) one that is the one who emanates as the gentle one the Holy Spirit so when you find over many many preaching rosters you find the symbol you're not always sure he's at a reference to the Holy Spirit or is it actually a reference to you know and when you find it in the solar blaze is that what Christianity is\n\n(49:00) all about Ezekiel eight thirteen and fourteen turn ye that again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was towards the north and behold they set women weeping for Tammuz so ancient Israel was duped into worshipping the\n\n(49:22) mother and the child and modern Israel is being duped talking about spiritual Israel to do the same interesting thing about these ancient gods is that they were also always associated with dark places they were associated with the Groves the goddess Diana she was the goddess of hunting and very often a deer\n\n(49:49) or something like that was associated with her as well and she also in all the pagan cultures emanated out of the cave she came out of the cave so here you have in these depictions over here you have these statues inside okay now these are in the cathedrals this one is and the main Jesuit Cathedral in\n\n(50:16) Czechoslovakia and there you have these deities or statues of them within caves and you have the letters I H s above which today they tell you means in his service but of course it doesn't mean any service at all the Catholic Church says it refers to EE esos hominem Salvatore which means Jesus the Saviour of men but\n\n(50:41) if you belong to a norcold circle you will recognize it as Isis Horus said the Egyptian Trinity Isis Horus sipp said was the dark one he is the other side of the Cyrus Osiris and saber really interchangeable the one is the light and the other one is the darkness the one is good the other one is evil if you would\n\n(51:04) like you could worship them today in occult circles they do they worship them as Lucifer the Light Bearer or as Satan Satanism and Luciferian worship worship one in the same deity and that is why Luciferians and Satanists are often good buddies the one practicing the light the other one practicing the darkness\n\n(51:28) Satanists have to do good deeds in order to appease their God and they have to sacrifice to their God Luciferians have to do exactly the same thing and they can interchange they can sit on both chairs because it doesn't matter whether you worship on the dark side or whether you worship on the light side and it\n\n(51:48) gets frightening because you cannot tell the two apart sometimes well if you go to the ancient cathedrals this is the cathedrals in Cologne you have the symbol of Apollo the Sun God there and then you have the moon and the stars Sun Moon and stars that's the three aspects of the Sun God like you had Brahma Siva\n\n(52:10) Vishnu Brahma the Sun rising Siva the Sun at the meridian Vishnu the victim man the Sun plunges into the waters at night becomes the fish God or Poseidon rises out of the water and his worship either as Poseidon or the serpent or the or the triune form in this Cathedral over here you have very interesting relief here\n\n(52:38) you have the lion with eagle's wings with the Sun at the back a very prominent Babylonian symbol and the Roman Catholic Church calls this a symbol of sin mark now I'm sure you'll find great difficulty finding a lion with eagle's wings with the solar blaze behind the head as a symbol of sins mark would you now what is he looking at he's\n\n(53:03) looking at a circle over here with a cross in it and that was one of the main symbols of the solar deity this was a symbol of Lucifer the symbol of the circle with a cross in it you find it in many many organizations today the other symbol of course is the symbol of the bull remember the bull is the\n\n(53:29) number one letter the the one the symbol of of the Light Bearer Lucifer also with the blaze behind him they call him Saint Luke of Marco so Luke and there you have again the same symbol also butterflies symbol of fertility cult the butterfly goes from flower to flower the bee is also a symbol of the fertility cult it also\n\n(53:54) goes from flower to flower to flower young girls if you have the butterfly tattooed onto your shoulder it has a much deeper meaning than you might think let's see if we can find the symbols of the bull and the lion sure we can there they are the Isis and Uranus temple number two three encyclopedia of the\n\n(54:14) unexplained magic occultism and parapsychology Isis is associated with both the bull cult and the lion cult and the Phoenix comes as the Phoenix all right back to Catholicism if you go to Roman Catholic Gardens associated with cathedrals or with monasteries in the garden you will find Mary often depicted in a cave situation it's the\n\n(54:42) goddess of the Grove where do you lead something like that in the Bible the goddess of the Grove and Mary in the cathedrals basements is also in the cave and comes out of the cave and here you have the occult way of writing Mary the M is capitalized over here but the M is the Sigma on its side and it's the\n\n(55:09) symbol that is used by the occult world masonry Freemasonry uses the M as well as one of its chief identifying features then you have the R as a triangle and it's a sex a guessable triangle 60 60 60 degrees it's a 666 triangle that the dot of the eye is superimposed on top and the dots becomes the symbol of the Sun\n\n(55:40) also has another connotation which is somewhat naughty which we will leave out and then you left with the Rhea who was the ancient goddess of these so here you have it in a full glory coming out of the cave and interesting what you will also find in paganism is three arches as you can see it over there now I've\n\n(56:03) already shown you three arches in ancient temples when we went to Petra remember we went to the one temple and I showed you three arches and I said that has to do with paganism now in Catholicism you find three arches associated with the deities and the goddess or the gods often come out of the cave that's why at Lourdes you have\n\n(56:24) the Pope praying in the grotto now this is not something that is just for Catholicism it's all the pagan religions the goddess Diana she was the god of the forests and then she was also the god the goddess of hunting so that is what you have now here in Japan have another interesting feast this is the sun goddess amaterasu as she\n\n(56:55) emerges mergers out of the cave in their annual festivals they celebrate this goddess notice that her face is painted white and her hands are often painted white now when you have miming for example you have the people with their hands faith painted white and their their face is painted white these are\n\n(57:18) ancient rituals that can be taken back to Sun worship and we bring them right into our churches these days as something unique and exciting and in the final analysis its Sun worship if you take the the African culture when they become initiated into the fertility of manhood the fertility cult then they\n\n(57:42) paint their faces white with kaolin clay in their hands so this is where it comes from so these ancient goddesses were all the goddesses of the caves and she's the one who crushes the Serpent's head but Christ is the one who should crush the Serpent's head but the irony is that she doesn't only crush the Serpent's head\n\n(58:05) she nurtures the serpent because the serpent through her represents death and resurrection it is the counterfeit of the death and the resurrection of Christ so through the female you have the fertility power to produce new life and therefore it has very heavy sexual connotations this religion do we find\n\n(58:29) the same in Catholicism yes unfortunately because Catholicism today is the ultimate form of the ancient Babylonian religion and therefore sadly the papacy must be the high priests of the ancient occult pagan religion here you have married dressed in blue and white and there you have her standing on the serpent just like the ancient\n\n(58:59) goddess and standing in the half moon which is the symbol of the womb and is the symbol of the female deity and now let's see what Roman Catholicism says this one comes from the Cathedral in in San Mary's Cathedral in Cape Town and the sinner says here to the Immaculate mary the vows of my baptism I renounce Satan and\n\n(59:23) then it says in the presence of the heavenly Court I choose neither stay for my mother and mistress I deliver and consecrate to thee as thy slave my body and soul my Goods both interior and exterior and even the value of my good actions past present and future Living to thee the entire and full right of\n\n(59:43) disposing of me and all that belongs to me without exception according to thy good pleasure for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity I'm in so who then becomes the ultimate deity in your life is it Jesus or is it Mary must be married so you have replaced Jesus with another deity now I was stunned I\n\n(1:00:08) was stunned when I came here in Syria I was recently in Syria and I did a tour of those ancient sites archaeological sites and I came here to a town called Cydonia which is in a totally Islamic land and they have this huge statue of Mary and you have this huge statue of the deer now the story goes that the king an\n\n(1:00:36) ancient king was traveling through here and he saw the deer and he went hunting the deer and he lifts his troops behind and as he pulled his his bow and his arrow to shoot the deer it transformed itself in front of him into Mary and Mary said to him you must build me a monastery in this place now this is a\n\n(1:01:00) site of worship not only for Catholics but for Muslims as well this is interesting because this is where religions meet and here miracles take place in this particular monastery they have an icon and this icon was supposedly drawn by none other than Luke it's an icon of Mary with child which is a bit weird\n\n(1:01:26) because Luke didn't know Jesus as a baby but besides that the icon leaks tears of oil and the oil stands there and you can take this oil as something to cleanse you or for holy purposes and as someone was walking out with the oil they spilt a drop and of course it changed into the image of Mary now this is the monastery\n\n(1:01:51) built on an ancient hill so immediately I was suspicious and thought to myself if this monastery is standing on an ancient hill then it's an ancient high place and I should find the evidence of the ancient pagan worship of the deity in the form of the ancient arches so I went walking all around this monastery\n\n(1:02:14) and over this hill and I was so pleased to find it but nevertheless there it is the monastery stands on top of the hill it's an ancient high place that is the cave it is sealed with a cross where the ancient worship took place they are the triple arches and they have Greek inscriptions and they are dedicated to\n\n(1:02:38) the ancient peak pagan deities so Catholicism is the age-old Babylonian religion encrusted here is the place where the drop fell and they have this bar around it with all these locks on it I don't know what purpose the locks served they don't lock anything but there are lots of them can you see and there it is that's where the drop fell\n\n(1:03:03) and it formed the image of Mary let me enlarge it for you there it is and this is the ancient painting that was supposedly painted by Luke save all these ancient in crustaceans and pagan forms of worship now the little baby which supposedly Jesus is here worshiped in this Cathedral in Rome as Tammuz now\n\n(1:03:29) they call him Bambino maybe Jesus but look at him crowning gold and silver this is the most precious little doll that you can imagine and here are all the the letters that are written to Bambino this is Tammuz Jesus never came like that did he my Jesus was born in a manger he didn't come dressed in gold\n\n(1:03:52) and jewels and silver and being worshipped as a little baby like that these are the ancient or the letters that are written Catholicism teaches that you can be forgiven in advance for your sins even to this day here you have the la Santa Scala and these are thus this is the staircase catholicism claims\n\n(1:04:19) some amazing stories to this day it sounds unbelievable that this staircase is the one that Jesus stood on when he was condemned by Pilate and he had the crown of thorns and the blood dripped down and there are drops of blood supposedly still on the staircase and they put a little plaques over it now\n\n(1:04:41) you can crawl up that staircase and if you do this and you kiss the places where the drops of blood supposedly fell then you get 90 days absolution 3 months free ahead of time don't have fun you're forgiven 3 months ahead of time by the way where that staircase come from it was of course in Jerusalem and it get\n\n(1:05:06) here well Rome claims and you can find this today right there that it appeared one night transported by angels from Jerusalem to Rome and there it stood one morning and they built the cathedral around it you can believe it if you like let's have a look at the mess well this photograph comes from the\n\n(1:05:28) Church of all nations and you will notice over here that the altar stands on a rock now in all pagan religions you have holy stone worship holy rock worship and God in the Old Testament constantly warns against those that have their holy stones and their holy rocks Catholicism is encrusted with it Catholics teach that the sacrifice of\n\n(1:05:56) the mass is and ought to be considered one and the same as that of the cross as the victim is one in the same namely Christ our Lord this is Catechism of the Council of Trent this is not just some source so Christ is sacrifice again and again every time the mass is said they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and\n\n(1:06:22) put him to open shame Hebrews 6 verse 6 the Bible says by how many sacrifices did he make forever one sacrifice forever so the sacrifice of the mass is in a sense a symbol of the victory of Lucifer over Christ he keeps him sacrificed and the crucifix where Christ stays on the crucifix is a symbol of the\n\n(1:06:49) victory of Lucifer over Christ 9 paganism the cross was also worshipped as a symbol of the son of course and Lucifer made that one of his main symbols now Hebrews 10 verse 14 says by one offering one sacrifice he has perfected forever them that are sanctified if you look at the Vatican this comes from the Vatican Museum you\n\n(1:07:15) have an angel supporting the triple crown supporting Christ on the cross keeping him on the cross so the crucifix in a sense is a symbol of victory of a Christ and the eating of the bread is an ancient pagan ritual the Eucharist or host has the letters IH s on it Isis Horus sip and the host from the Latin\n\n(1:07:41) meaning the sacrifice the round wafer whose roundness is so important in the Roman mystery is another system of symbol of Wow Babylon myths mystery religion ancient modern page 129 so the roundness is a symbol of the Sun and there you have it in the even sided cross which is also the symbol of the Sun God the Sun\n\n(1:08:03) deity alright there we have it in the Assyrian you had the symbol of the Sun which was round and it was placed in the half moon which was the symbol of the birth into the womb of the Sun God and it was called Baal Haddad and it was also often a star in a moon and the star represents the star from the east it was\n\n(1:08:30) called the dog star and it was a representation of Sirius now remember the ancient Maggie the three wise men that came to Jesus is that right now are caught ISM today in the Masonic form teaches that the wise men followed the star in the east and followed it to Bethlem that's what they teach Christian\n\n(1:09:01) if the wise men came from the east then where was the star relative to them over Bethlem it was in the West so in actual fact the star that they are serving is not the star which represents Jesus Christ but the one in the east which represents Sirius the dog star and is a symbol of Lucifer not of Jesus Christ so\n\n(1:09:30) that was the ancient Mesopotamian symbol of Baal haddad the star or the ramdisk it doesn't matter whether it's the one or the other the one is simply the form Horus which is the rebirth and the other one is the form of Cyrus which is the adult form it doesn't matter which one it is so here you have the symbol of a Cyrus\n\n(1:09:51) the round disc in the half moon which is the symbol of Isis or there you have the symbol of Horus which is the the birth of the Sun the s om and the Halfmoon now who uses that symbol today which religion has that as its main symbol Islam Islam has this as its main symbol and Islam and Catholicism stand side by\n\n(1:10:16) side you go to the to the Middle East you go to Islamic countries where evangelism is forbidden where you may not provide in the name of Jesus Christ you will find the mosque and the Catholic cathedral next to each other wherever you go with you go to Amman with you go to Jerusalem with you go to Syria you do it and you will see the\n\n(1:10:43) Roman Catholic cathedral and this one standing side-by-side why because it's the same deity it's ba ha dad let's have a look here is the Pope with the wafer the roundness representing ball areas with a cup Bacchus was the god of wine and drunkenness and they served fermented wine whereas the biblical symbol was no\n\n(1:11:14) leavin in the bread and therefore if the leaven is a symbol of sin then it must have been unfermented wine as well but they used fermented wine and the round symbol and they place it in a monstrance which has a Halfmoon in it and by the way on this particular Catholic monstrance you have wavy rays of the Sun\n\n(1:11:36) and straight ones the wavy ones represent the female deity the straight ones the male deity and this one has the letters SF s on it now in the mysteries you have to work out what these letters mean s was the sixth letter in the Greek alphabet F is the sixth letter in whose alphabet powers SF s stands for six six six\n\n(1:12:04) you have to know their little tricks here's another monstrance and there you can see it very typically the half moon and then when the mass is said at a high mass then the disk is placed in there and you have exactly the same symbol for the deity that is used in Islam exactly the same symbol and there's another one\n\n(1:12:26) and other monstrance for the wafer it's placed in there and you have bow Haddad well there you have a - in ancient Hittite culture and there you have the symbol of the peacocks by the way as well there you have the half moon there you have the face of Apollo the circle and then you have the laurel wreath\n\n(1:12:46) normally with 13 leaves around it oh by the way which mighty organization on our planet uses that symbol the United Nations that's very interesting you in and and that by the way is another name for another deity but we'll come to that later here you have Mitra Mitra ISM now Mitra is the one who kills the bull and here\n\n(1:13:20) you have a dog helping him and they have a serpent helping him and you have a scorpion stinging the bull in a very strategic place and if you look at the Hat of Mitra it looks like that that's the metric hat Mithraism now I want you to look at that head carefully because in a later lecture we'll pick it up\n\n(1:13:44) he'll be stunned where we pick up the Hat of Mitra very interesting the structure of the cult was hierarchical through a series of seven grades each of which had a special symbol Couric's was the raven on the mercury was a made-up word meaning male bride these are the levels of Mithras 'm under Venus\n\n(1:14:09) the goddess so the priests of Mitra had to be celibate because they were married as a male bride to the goddess Venus do we have a religious system today with a male priests have to be celibate alright then we have Millis under Mars we have leo under Jupiter passes under Luna the moon hit your dramas under the Sun Sol\n\n(1:14:36) the Sun and finally we have Potter that's the highest grade the top grade of Mitra ISM father and the Saturn Neos and Saturn is the god of the underworld Saturn is the god of death Saturn is the equivalent of the gods SIB in the Egyptian trilogy now part of father do we have a religious system today where\n\n(1:15:02) the priest is celibate where the deity is referred to the one that is the mediator is a female and where he is called father do we have a system like that today well you know they say but let me not not not be stranger let's just say it looks exactly like the old system then what's the possibility that\n\n(1:15:24) it is the old system 100% I agree with you the Egyptian Sun god Osiris he was worshipped by feeding a round wafer braved exactly as they do today and this host is carried ritually through the streets in Catholicism as it was in pagan times Baal Haddad the system is the system of road do you think in the final analysis that the big\n\n(1:15:55) religions of the world will have a problem in identifying with the Bishop of Rome yes or no no they won't have a problem because under layers of strata of hidden doctrine and what the masses know and what the insiders know at the very top they are one religion and they serve the same master now I'm not going\n\n(1:16:21) to tell you who served the master because I could be accused ask the Bible what does the Bible say who gave him his seat his power and great authority Revelation chapter 13 the dragon and who's that according to the Bible as Satan so that's Luciferian worship that's what it is here you have the symbols of Sun Moon and star in\n\n(1:16:42) Catholicism on all their cathedrals and this one is fascinating this is a Catholic cathedral in in Germany as well I was stunned it's all over the place look at this even in their clocks they know what they're doing they know what they're doing this is a modern building here you have the symbol of the moon and\n\n(1:17:01) the star and when the clock goes round they have the birth of the Sun God Baal Haddad Baal Haddad ball Haddad ball Haddad telling the world who the deities that's why you have her over here in the half moon with the blaze of the Sun straight and cold rays there you have the full catastrophe as well straight\n\n(1:17:25) curved in the half moon standing on the serpent design tient pagan deities there you have the the Trinity as well the half moon with Mary and child in the Hoffman same in all these ancient paintings and the symbol of the bird feeding his flesh to his young symbol of the Phoenix who rises from the ashes and\n\n(1:17:49) gives his life six dialogues on the Lord's Day Sunday being the law the day on which the Gentiles solemnly adored that planet the Sun they called it that the Christians thought fit to keep the same day and the same name of it that they might not appear causelessly peevish and by that means hinder the\n\n(1:18:11) conversion of the Gentiles this is Roman Catholic thinking so in other words Sunday worship of the day of the Sun comes in now I will say as her priests have violated my law and have profaned my holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the profane neither they showed any difference between unclean and clean and\n\n(1:18:31) they've hid their eyes from my Sabbath's and I profaned amongst them we saw how Rome shifted the Sabbath day from the Saturday to the Sunday to bring it in line with pagan worship Webster's dictionary says Sunday so-called because this day was anciently dedicated to the Sun or its worship the first day of the\n\n(1:18:53) week there's a reason for that it's because that really is the worship they're not deceived those in high positions know exactly what they are doing they know it exactly here's the face of the child in the fertility symbol on a Roman Catholic altar and what you have around there I will not explain let's rather leave it alone male\n\n(1:19:16) female symbol face of Apollo the Catholic world says the Sun was the foremost what is that symbol of healing hence the church would seem to have said keep that old pagan name it shall remain consecrated sanctified and that's the pagan Sunday dedicated to Baal - Balder became the Christian Sunday sacred to\n\n(1:19:41) Jesus this Jesus is not Jesus of Nazareth this is the other Savior Javert the Savior the other God in the place the counterfeit Savior and there you have the the Sun as a symbol over there there you have a symbol on a stained-glass window of the changed law only three on the one tablet they should be for there you have the face of Apollo\n\n(1:20:07) on a Greek temple and of course you will find it on the Roman Catholic altar because it's the same deity can you see now why this beast has Lion Babylonian Greek the leopard component the bear component the feet because the for example the tiara that the Pope is crowned with comes from meter person times they have it in Scandinavia they\n\n(1:20:33) have those other symbols on the walls let's forget about them and you have the symbols of the Sun all around this is fertility cult stuff and this whole issue over here is a symbol of the victory of Lucifer over I don't I will have to go into ocultism to see that it's really quite scary and we'll come to that there's\n\n(1:20:59) another Triple Crown over there supposedly representing God the Father so here you have the crucifix being carried around the symbol of the death of the one and the resurrection of the other what about halos well they have a halo in the Japanese god of happiness they have a halo in Krishna they have a halo\n\n(1:21:25) in a Hindu deity it's a symbol of the Sun and they have a halo in a Roman Catholic figure this one I photographed in the cathedral brand-new Cathedral that they both in London the Roman Catholic cathedral it has so many pagan symbols and just boggles the mind and by the way the Crozier is the serpent can\n\n(1:21:49) you see that they leaned upon the serpent very interesting well here's another Eastern deity with the halo behind it and there are the Japanese and Chinese ones with the halos behind them and the symbol of the Cross there you have it in Mesopotamia it was a symbol of the Sun God this is long before Christ long before Christ they have it\n\n(1:22:16) again in a Mesopotamian relief and there you have it this cross in the form of an ankh and hunk is a symbol of life the deity gives life and the pagan priests wore it around their necks so you have this line going around coming down and very often stretching up here now who wears something like that today Roman\n\n(1:22:38) Catholic priests wear it so there you can see the line going around the ribbon going around is this part going around the neck and very often they have the lines going up the side symbolizing exactly the same thing this is a statue of Mary holding lightning in her hand now it's Mary got to do with lightning\n\n(1:22:59) well there's a statue of this with lightning in his hand because whether you use the male form or the female form this deity being androgenic it doesn't matter it's one in the same deity pagan symbols and hand signals this is the pagan symbol of the ancient Trinity sources shown like this and there you\n\n(1:23:25) have it in Roman Catholicism and there you have it in the ancient statue of Jupiter which today is revered as the statue of Peter by the way but it comes straight out of a pagan temple into the Vatican and there you have him with the ancient pagan symbol there you have someone kissing his feet and there you\n\n(1:23:50) have the same symbol in the Nordic tribes there you have the hand of Buda exactly the same thing or you have it in this form the three fingers there you have it in the papacy there you have the same symbol in Buddhism you see that if they're all use exactly the same aren't they're all exactly the same\n\n(1:24:13) behind the scenes now let's get to a little bit more modern cathedrals this symbol of the Sun over there and this triple yin-yang which is the ancient symbol of Sun worship you find in the Roman Catholic cathedral and this one here is phenomenal here is the symbol on the floor of the Cathedral in London the\n\n(1:24:40) main Catholic cathedral it is the ancient triple yin-yang which they've reduced now to to just reflecting good and evil and in the middle it makes this structure which is the Mitsu Tom have you noticed that on these animated TV production kiddies games on television the superheroes superwoman and soup\n\n(1:25:05) this and super that they carry ism it's a top symbol of the Sun God symbol of Lucifer and they throw it beep ninjas also use it the mystical symbol of Lucifer on the floor of a Roman Catholic cathedral if you're not satisfied yet let me take you to this Roman Catholic cathedral is is one where the prominent people of the world I'm\n\n(1:25:32) talking about the world leaders where they meet what's this on the door of a Roman Catholic cathedral do you recognize it it's a ying yang on the door of a roman catholic cathedral and inside the cathedral what is this black and white squares representing the good and the evil aspects as you find it in\n\n(1:25:59) masonry and what is that the furnace rising out of the ashes symbol of the resurrection and life-giving force of the Light Bearer Lucifer very interesting well here you have the Trident there's another Trident know.some Trident SAR depicted with wavy and straight lines that's again union of the male and the female Poseidon Neptune\n\n(1:26:30) all of them had the Trident do you think we'll find the Trident in Roman Catholicism well we should if it's a symbol there you have the Trident over there in ass as a symbol in Hinduism and there you have it in the church in Roman Catholic and in Anglican churches if you look carefully you'll find the Trident\n\n(1:26:52) either just blatantly or on top of Christ or in some cases over here this one has the full catastrophe as the pagan hand Sonya is the Brayton globe plus he has the tribe Trident over there here you have the fleur-de-lis in the ancient Assyrian cherub God there's the fleur-de-lis they use this as a symbol\n\n(1:27:14) because it has a male fertility connotation this Isis with the fleur-de-lis would you expect it in Catholicism this comes from paganism well yes the fleur-de-lis in Catholicism in a Catholic Church on a Catholic Opta they have the flee of the Li coming this is an urn back in the Cathedral on the head of Christ and\n\n(1:27:36) coming out of both of his ears rather sad when called here very well with the fleur-de-lis in each year and then of course you have these mantras have you heard of mantras well Matthew chapter 6 verse 7 when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think they shall be heard for their much\n\n(1:28:01) speaking a mantra is a repetitive prayer to put you into an altered state of consciousness and that is what we have in the music today where young people when they are taken to certain festivities where drugs often or associated they also use mantras mantras built into the music to place them in an altered state of consciousness so that\n\n(1:28:29) another power can take over so mantras repetitive prayer are a symbol of all the pagan religions you will find that in Islam you will find it in Catholicism you'll find it in all of them are ways that come from from Babylon there you have the pagan priests of Baal with their mantra beads in their hands they\n\n(1:28:50) have Hindu deities with their mantra beads in their hands and this of course is another very interesting symbol this is the eye of Osiris hot or the eye of the god Osiris the one-eyed God there you have it on the altar of a Roman Catholic cathedral in France it is always the symbol of a Cyrus the symbol of the male form Osiris\n\n(1:29:20) or the female form the cow hot or the sacred cow the female deity she was worshipped as in the fertility cult as a cow giving milk nurturing the young or as a beautiful woman there you have the same symbol the triangle is sexagesimal that means it has 60 60 degrees mostly six six six triangle in the in the in\n\n(1:29:46) the mysteries the zero counts for nothing so if you have 360 degrees you have three plus six plus zero you have nine nine is the six upside down nine is one of the highest numbers in our cult ism they have and the same symbol on a Roman Catholic altar here you have it in the New Age movement and when you go to the cathedrals you'll\n\n(1:30:11) find it everywhere symbol of hot or or symbol of a cyrus there it is in front of a Jesuit Cathedral on Estela also you have over here the shell symbol of the universe there were 360 degrees in the universe there were 36 rooms by the way all our systems are encrusted with this pagan culture if you take a pack of\n\n(1:30:40) cards they are four suits there are four seasons there are 52 cards they are 52 weeks in a year because you had this movement through the zodiac of the planets and this is all depicted in card playing in chess in all these games but in any case the shell was a symbol of the zodiac and the movement through the\n\n(1:31:07) zodiac Poseidon was one of them here you have in Roman Catholic Church you have John the Baptist using the Coptic shell with a pagan symbol to baptize Jesus by the way the water is in the form of the female deity symbol and there you have it over the the arches of the churches there you have Venus born out of the\n\n(1:31:30) shell and of course it is one of the prominent symbols in the Catholic crest in st. Peter's every single pagan symbol you will find it there there it is in paganism you'll find it in Catholicism with the Trinity in the globe another symbol of the pagan deity he is the god Mitra holding the globe representing the universe he is\n\n(1:31:55) the other deity the biggest globe in the world where will you find it on top of some pitas by the way there is a Rosicrucian cross and it has those symbols over there and they have also a fertility connotation which we don't have to discuss in any detail here's a globe as well you'll find it all over\n\n(1:32:17) the place the globe symbol of Mitra this is Tammuz but they say it's Jesus with prayer beads around his neck and with the globe in his hand same with this statue here the globe in the hand Sacred Heart worship which you find in Catholicism there you have it in Quetzalcoatl you'll find it through all\n\n(1:32:36) the pagan cultures it comes from Babylon and if you go to the Vatican and you look at the greatest central of this type of worship you'll find all the pagan symbols of Sun worship right here in st. Peters the Sun worship the moon worship you have the serpentine pillars of paninis canopy you have every aspect\n\n(1:33:01) of pagan worship you even have the dome which is known as the Sun dome symbol of Sun worship and on the floors of the cathedrals you will find the symbols of the zodiac that is why stargazing astrology all of these things that was the culture of the Chaldeans and today you have your stargazers and your people telling the presidents of\n\n(1:33:25) the world to which way is they should move the world hasn't changed at all Golden Door the Chapel of st. Ignatius this is in San Francisco there you have the unicorn and they have all the ancient ancient systems right down to the from the Phoenix to the dragon to the peacock to the ancient P and the X\n\n(1:33:50) which stands for 606 60 plus the circle which stands for the six or the nine remember the circle around it 360 degrees three plus six plus zero is nine nine is the six upside down so you can have that pagan symbol on many of the altars and it stands for 666 that's what it stands for whether we like it or not you have\n\n(1:34:12) the staff and the mitre and the unicorn now it's get a little bit closer and find out whether the Pope literally represents the ancient deities here you have the eagle God with a pinecone that was a symbol of fertility here you have the ancient winged cherub with a pinecone which was the symbol of his\n\n(1:34:37) power through the fertility cult the biggest pinecone and stuff you'll find here one of the biggest at least here know Cyrus worship this is the Egyptian deity of Cyrus at the Shepherd's rod with a pine cone on it and they have a Hindu deity with a pinecone in his hand so they're all the same the pinecone\n\n(1:35:00) symbol of the Mexican religion pine trees Christmas all those interesting things they have Dionysius with these stuff with a pine cone on it a little bit of Bacchus with a pine cone on it and there's the biggest pine cone in the world in the court of the Vatican there's another one in the Marian court\n\n(1:35:19) with a symbol of the female deity because Isis always walked with two peacocks similar fertility in the Vatican Square and there is the Crozier the Shepherd's rod of the Pope and it always has the pine cone on it do you think they know what they are doing or do you think this is pure chance and incidental well it can no longer be\n\n(1:35:44) chance it can no longer be chance this is the stuff that the present Pope uses it's the same one by the way which was used by the previous Pope and it has this cross the bent cross and it has Jesus down there like that making the sex a guessable triangle there's the pinecone on his stop and the bent cross is the\n\n(1:36:15) symbol of Lucifer you'll find it in Luciferian worship you'll find it in Satan worship and you'll find it in places where you will not expect it what about the pagan feasts in Christianity the solar symbol and the feasts of France you had summer solstice and winter solstice doesn't become the feast of Sun John and the\n\n(1:36:37) Feast of the Immaculate Conception where they jump over the fire these are Roman Catholic festivals they are pagan festivals here you have Europe European Sun wish and Drude worshiped exactly the same thing the lighting of the fire the circular movement of the drudes the drudes today are alive and well and living in Britain did you know\n\n(1:36:58) that and you know that Drude worship well let's not get into the details let me leave a little bit for later it gets very exciting the tower burning it's the festival of San John and orbs that is told used today what about Christmas well Christmas is celebrated everywhere Christmas is a representation of the\n\n(1:37:23) serpent who gives life to the tree Osiris who was cut down and through the life of the serpent the life-giving serpent the tree sprouts and gives rise to a young shoot this was decorated with round globes and lighted up in ancient times to celebrate the rebirth of a cyrus in the form of Horus they would\n\n(1:37:46) also take the log which they called the jewel log and throw it in the fire representing the death and the suffering of a cyrus with his resurrection the mistletoe symbol of fertility and love if you stand under the mistletoe and get kissed that's it you're in love well what was the sacrifice to the gods on\n\n(1:38:08) that particular day the main sacrifice were two unclean animals was the goose and it was the pig you go to Europe in Germany the dinner for Christmas is the Christmas goose if you go to England it is the gammon the gammon and the goose the two offerings later different birds were substituted but the pig deity\n\n(1:38:32) is right there in with it here you have the gaunt goddess amaterasu Surya worship here you go whether it's Amaterasu Soraya's incidental here so Riya rides through the heavens with his horse-drawn carriage and on the winter solstice Surya rides through the heavens drawn by his carriage well depending\n\n(1:38:57) where you were here you have Sariah being drawn through the heavens with a horse-drawn carriage if you were the god this for example in Greece then you were drawn through the clouds and through the sky on the Solstice which was the 25th of December you were drawn through it by a carriage drawn by goats\n\n(1:39:21) but if you lived in Scandinavian countries where they were slow what do you think the animal was that drew the Sun God through the skies on the 25th of December well there you have the medallion of Sibel you have her in a carriage and you have the Sun and the half moon with a star being born in it and there again you have the Indian\n\n(1:39:46) miniature Surya it's exactly the same seraya whether it is Sibel whether it is the one form of the deity or the other if you go to the Visayan in france Helios and his Sun chariot coming out of the water being carried away these are the symbols they celebrate Elijah's transformation as he's riding through the sky they make a\n\n(1:40:10) Sun deity out of it they take all the symbols of Christianity and change them to pagan symbols now here's the Hittite right on you see that same as in Scandinavia the carriage was drawn by reindeer now where does that symbol come from that's an interesting name right Center now does that stand for st. - is\n\n(1:40:32) that Santa Santa is something totally different Santa if Yuri scramble that and you take this whole system into consideration and you could also get Satan now who designed the little happy man that rides through the skies and made it available to all our children well it was Walt Disney and while Disney was a\n\n(1:41:00) 33 degree freemason now what is the God of the 33 degree freemason well we'll have to ask them what it is and for that because I'm not gonna said I could get into trouble let them say it then they can get into trouble right come to a future lecture and let's see who the God of the 33 degree Freemason is let's have\n\n(1:41:22) a look at the origin of Santa Claus fourth stanza fourth century historical evidence shows that Saint Nicholas never existed as a human he was rather Christianized version of the pagan see God the Greek god Poseidon the Roman guard Neptune the Teutonic God hot nickel Nikolay shion's by the way the Bible\n\n(1:41:44) says in the Book of Revelations that God hates those that adhere to the doctrines of the Nikolay shion's those who served at the throne of Nicholas revelation says that but here we have Nicholas riding through the skies and our children say please send Nicholas bring us a prison where's Jesus in Christmas it's got\n\n(1:42:11) nothing to do with Christmas in the early centuries of the Christian Church many pagan gods and goddesses were humanized and converted to Christian saints when the church it created the personas son Nicholas they adopted Poseidon's title the Sailor they picked up the last name from Nica various temples of Poseidon became shrine of\n\n(1:42:31) Saint Nicholas of the Nicolaitans which God hates this comes from the in woman's encyclopedia of myths and secrets it's not me saying these things what's the theology of Santa Santa Santa is tautomers children he is only present he can visit hundreds of millions of homes in one night he's on listen he monitors each child he\n\n(1:42:52) he's all-seeing all-knowing he knows if they were good if they were bad he does have great powers he can manufacture gifts for hundreds of millions of children in one night each delivered to the correct child he's all good all judge he judges which children have shown good behavior and his eternal he\n\n(1:43:10) never dies what do you make of him then well please II a Stickle history of circuitry attributes the introduction of the festival of Easter into the church to the perpetuation of an old usage just as many are the customs this is Encyclopedia Britannica so Easter is the feast of Easter did you know the Pope the Pope had the calendar\n\n(1:43:34) shifted to bring it in line that's why we had the Gregorian calendar today to bring it in line with the pagan feast of Ishtar and forced this worship onto the Christian world its paganism we think we're Christian but we're not let's ask the Catholic Encyclopedia that should help the Easter fire is lit on top of\n\n(1:43:54) the mountain this is a custom of pagan origin the church adopted the observance into the easter ceremony they admitted well Easter the egg Heliopolis Typhon the egg when you read about Easter bunnies and eggs in the Bible I haven't seen it but here it is pre-christian painted eggs it comes from paganism it is Sun worship\n\n(1:44:21) and the bun with a cross on it symbol of Tammuz I see the woman baking cakes for the Queen of Heaven symbol of the goddess worship so we have exactly the same the hot cross bun now let me just put you straight on something I'm not hooked on symbols I don't care what symbols they use I don't care what flowers they use I\n\n(1:44:46) don't care what symbols they use it doesn't matter it's just a symbol the fact that Satan applies that symbol to his worship is his business if somebody gives me a hot cross bun I'll eat it cross or no cross it's just a bun but the fact of the matter it is that there is a deeper connotation the Roman\n\n(1:45:06) Baths England noticed the serpent symbol the serpent is the life giver you find it in Egypt you find it in Hinduism everywhere you find the serpent it is the most prominent symbol there you have the Hydra you find it everywhere would you find it in Catholicism of course he has a modern cathedral with a serpent\n\n(1:45:27) and the main crest of the Vatican has the dragon serpent on it and the dragon on the papal crest in the Vatican Museum the Vitesse means the diviner can is the serpent Vatican means the divining serpents dragon worship that's what it is the Bible says the dragon gave him a seat and power and great authority there's\n\n(1:45:58) the same symbol as was used for pagan Rome because the Vatican has taken the seat of Caesar it's one and the same thing there's the ancient symbol of the dragon on a Roman bridge the Vatican has just taken it over the greatest serpents in the world you will find on Bernini's canopy in Rome it's interesting that\n\n(1:46:20) some Paul's Cathedral which was a Protestant Cathedral has been totally rebuilt and now has a duplicate of scent of paninis canopy inside it and on this altar you have the birth process taking place in Pope Joan the only female Pope who was a male but turned out to be a female and gave birth they don't hide it\n\n(1:46:45) they put it onto the altar it's part of the fertility Rite to be on that same altar symbol of the pagan fertility Rite just as the crosier of the goddess was a serpent so the closures of ceremonial bishops stress is also either a dragon or a serpent as you would find it in Egypt as covering cherub serpents\n\n(1:47:15) solar wheels now it gets exciting I'm almost done hang around a serial Babylonian alter with the solar wheel notice there's the straight one and there's the curved one so you have two crosses one in the other they don't always have to be curved and straight but the one represents the female the curved one and the other one represents\n\n(1:47:38) the union of the male and the female so you have eight spokes in this system this is called the solar wheel now there you have the solar wheel in a Buddhist temple and there you have it in Egyptian Osiris riding the solar wheel it's just eight spokes and that's really what it is is the two crosses symbol of the Sun\n\n(1:47:59) God coming together there you have it in a catholic cathedral and not too dumb and there you have it on that famous temple at qur'anic in india where they have all those terrible sculptures which are associated with that form of worship there's another solar wheel with the Madonna holding it there's a modern one\n\n(1:48:21) on the Roman Catholic altar and the biggest solar wheel in the world you will find in the Vatican square there it is now this is an interesting story this solar wheel there it is you know eight spokes if you count them over there one two three four five six seven eight in the middle you have the main symbol of\n\n(1:48:46) the Sun God which is the circle with a cross in it remember I showed you the bull and I showed you the lion looking towards the circle with a cross in it that's symbol of Sun worship and in the middle you have the Stella there it stands the symbol of a cyrus transported from Egypt to this particular spot and\n\n(1:49:06) the Pope had it moved to that spot and he commissioned or he put out a tender to move it and he commissioned that those who moved it to this spot should them let it fall and it should break all the workers would be put to death it took a long while to find someone who would actually do it but they finally\n\n(1:49:31) did it and built it now the interesting thing about this is that you have this huge solar wheel and you have a wheel within a wheel there's the wheel within the bigger wheel now the throne of God in Ezekiel is described as a wheel within a wheel and here the throne of another deity is described as a wheel\n\n(1:49:58) within a wheel we have today on this planet a real live representative of all the deities of Babylon in other words the vestments the title Pontifex Maximus can be traced all the way back as it came through history and it today subsides in the papacy I'm not condemning any Roman Catholic remember I'm not talking about\n\n(1:50:30) people I'm talking about a system the system represents it and I believe there are many many priests in Roman Catholicism who serve God to the best of their conscience and God acknowledges them as his children I believe that and I've met many but when they hear the truth they come out of her my people you\n\n(1:50:57) cannot serve both Baal and the other one at the same time you cannot serve good and evil at the same time you cannot serve two masters so there is a choice involved now if we know that the system represents not Jesus Christ but represents the other light bearer who's a cultic name is Lucifer then we must\n\n(1:51:24) make a decision and I'm telling you tonight I believe in fact I I know I am convinced let's put it that way they're in the highest circles and in the inner Moving's of the secret societies within the system they know exactly who they are worshipping and I will prove it to you in future lectures I'll put the quotes on the screen\n\n(1:51:48) showing who the deity is that they worship by name then we have a king of Babylon today if anyone boughs down to him and accepts his authority over and above the authority of God then you are bowing down to the system and you become subject to the king of Babylon and that is something which we as Christians\n\n(1:52:15) should not do because the Bible tells us come out of her my people that you'd be not partakers of her sins I know that this is terrible information but all I've done is I've shown you paganism I've taken you to Babylon and I've traced it through all the religions and you find its greatest manifestation\n\n(1:52:37) every single time within Catholicism down to the rod that he carries with the pagan encrustations on it he knows exactly what he's doing they know exactly what they're doing and where it comes from but it's hidden under a gob of Christianity and when you do that you call it deception now I was a Roman\n\n(1:53:01) Catholic and when I saw these things when I studied Daniel chapter 7 I was I was shattered I got sick because I was really a sincere Roman Catholic I got sick and I studied the scriptures and I went to the libraries to see if these things were so and they were so I studied the history and I said there\n\n(1:53:23) must be a way up this cannot be and it was so and in the end I had no choice and the more I looked the more I studied the more I saw the more I saw that I was being duped into believing in another God I remember sitting once in a Roman Catholic Church and I was sitting there and I was saying every time I come to Mass every time I\n\n(1:53:48) go down on my knees every time I go take the wafer and I feel so empty please talk to me God do you exist and I said in that church and I said God if you exist please reveal yourself to me and show me that you exist because I cannot understand the ritual anymore I cannot have a relationship of ritual I\n\n(1:54:12) need a relationship of the heart tell me whether you exist it was the most dangerous question I ever asked because it led me to the Bible and it led me to show you what I show you tonight I don't condemn any Roman Catholic I was one myself my whole family is Roman Catholic and I love my family and I don't want\n\n(1:54:33) them to be lost and I want anyone to be lost I'm not condemning I'm revealing choose thee this day whom you will serve thank you and come again to the next lectures please don't miss them thanks for coming [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
  "# Title:220_a_woman_rides_the_beast_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nPapal power,End-time prophecy,Babylonian religion,Religious deception,Worldly systems\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture interprets the biblical prophecies of Revelation, particularly the \"woman rides the Beast\" imagery, to identify a worldwide apostate religious-political power that opposes God. The speaker asserts that this \"woman\" represents the Roman Catholic Church, historically and presently, which has deviated from biblical truth through various \"fornication\" or false doctrines and pagan practices. The \"Beast\" is described as the overarching system of Satan's influence throughout history, with its \"seven heads\" symbolizing a succession of persecuting empires and its \"ten horns\" representing the complete array of global political powers that will eventually align with this apostate church to enforce its agenda. This system, also linked to the \"man of sin\" and the Antichrist, is predicted to wage war against God's faithful, ultimately being destroyed by Christ's return.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 220 - A Woman Rides the Beast _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dGYgksYk0Y\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well the title of this lecture is a woman rides the Beast because that's exactly what it says in the Book of Revelation in the last lecture that we had on Revelation chapter 13 we looked at the various issues pertaining to the papal power and the power that arises out of the Earth and we identified that\n\n(01:31) as the United States which would force the world to accept legislation honoring the first Beast now that is a process which will have to continue over all the kingdoms of the world now Revelation chapter 17 gives us more details on this issue and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials and\n\n(01:58) talked with me saying unto me come hither and I will show ye the Judgment of the great these are strong words that sth upon many Waters so here is a woman that is a prostitute in other words she is unfaithful to god a woman in a biblical sense is a church and there are numerous texts in the old and the New Testament to substantiate this\n\n(02:25) Christ is also the husband he's coming to fetch his bride the church the woman aspect over there so this great apostate woman sits on many Waters and we saw that the waters are multitudes nations peoples tongues according to the definition in Revelation itself and with this woman the kings of the Earth have committed fornication\n\n(02:54) that means they have had relationships with her which were of course contrary to the relations that God would like them to have and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication that would mean if wine is a symbol of teachings doctrines then uh wine of fornication that makes drunk is\n\n(03:21) doctrine that confuses the mind so basically what the text says is that a church an apostate church is in control of issues the kings of the world have relations with this apostate church and they are drunk they cannot understand because they have absorbed these doctrines which are contrary to the Bible because they are doctrines of\n\n(03:51) prostitution so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast so here is a red color this is a color of sacrifice and it was full of names of blasphemy so it there's a Blasphemous power and we saw what that meant when we looked at Revelation chapter 13 and the\n\n(04:19) Bible gives us Clues by showing that to say that you are in the place of God that you are God on Earth that you can forgive sins that you can take that which applies appes to Christ and apply it to yourself that's a blasphemy and we saw that the Roman Church had actually done that so this woman sitting on the\n\n(04:39) Scarlet Beast full of the names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and that of course again is the symbol that we had in Revelation chap 13 if you count the heads that we have in all the beasts of Daniel chapter 7 you will find that there are seven heads there as well because the first Beast obviously has\n\n(05:03) one head over there which represents Babylon the lion me Persia has one head Greece is represented having four heads and then one head of the final beast in Daniel chapter 7 adds up to seven heads that means over time all the time periods are covered and have been incorporated into this one structure\n\n(05:28) this Catholicism structure has aspects of all the philosophies of all the kingdoms of the ages embodied in it it has perfected paganism if you would like to call it that the woman was arrayed in purple and Scarlet two colors which apply definitely to the Roman Church they Ed the colors purple and they Ed\n\n(05:53) the colors red for Cardinals and for Bishops and de with gold and precious stones and Pearls there's no doubt that this is the richest system that has ever existed having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication so this golden cup is full of false doctrines and upon her for it\n\n(06:19) was a name written mystery that means it is a concealed science if you like Babylon the Great the mother of harlots which implies that there are others other women if you like that are also apostate but she is the mother of them all and Abominations of the Earth this is very strong language and we will have\n\n(06:49) to see if this is so well let's have a look at the seven-headed beasts in Psalm 74:14 we read thou breakast the heads of leviatan in pieces and gavest him to be meat food to the people inhabiting the Wilderness so here is a beast that is described as leviatan a dragon-like beast and it is implied that it has more\n\n(07:17) than one head in mythology leviatan has seven heads Isaiah 27:1 in that day the Lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviatan the piercing servant even leviatan that crooked Serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea isn't that interesting slay the dragon that is in the sea do you remember that\n\n(07:48) we had some interesting symbolism when we looked at marity where Mary is called The Star of the Sea interesting interesting uh analogies Revelation 123 and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns so here we have a dragon in Isaiah and we don't know how many heads\n\n(08:17) it has we have a Laton in Psalm 74:14 which is applied to the dragon in Isaiah 27:1 and in Revelation we see that it has seven horns can you see how it all fits together if you use parallelism you can find all the heads that you need and seven crowns upon his heads so this dragon in Revelation 12 is\n\n(08:44) a ruling power he is in control he is the prince of this world Jesus calls Satan the prince of this world Revelation 13:1 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea see having seven heads and 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy so here we have now a division\n\n(09:14) into 10 horns that's 10 kingdoms upon the horns 10 crowns that means the Beast ruled with these 10 kingdoms that's the time of the Middle Ages when Rome ruled by means of the powers of Europe Revelation 17:3 and so I car carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman Upon A Scarlet colored\n\n(09:39) Beast full of the names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns obviously this is the representation of the kingdom of Satan throughout all the ages and in Revelation 17 we're going to have the culmination of his power in the final events just before the coming of Christ so the dragon has seven heads in\n\n(10:05) the Book of Revelation the heads denote political Powers through whom the dragon works but just for interest sake it is interesting that Satan tried seven times to set up his own unchallenged kingdom firstly there was a war in heaven and God's response was expulsion of Satan from heaven then Adam and Eve and the pre flood\n\n(10:33) world he tried to set up his kingdom God's response to Adam and Eve promise of redemption sacrificial system then Tower of Babel was his next attempt to set up Unity of all the nations on Earth God's response confusion of tongues separating the Nations interesting then during the Incarnation he thought if he could destroy Christ he\n\n(11:02) can set up his kingdom victory over sin and death was God's response turning the greatest apparent defeat into the greatest Victory the universe had ever seen he tried to set up his kingdom through Pagan Rome and the answer smna resolve people were prepared to die rather than to be eliminated he tried to set up\n\n(11:29) his uh system through papal roome the answer Reformation nowhere could he succeed will there be a final time when he will try and set up his kingdom something where all the nations come together in one great New World Order is that possible that would be interesting seven times he would have tried and there\n\n(11:53) there is an answer which I've called here midnight and Loud cry but we'll deal with that in another lecture it's kind of complicated Revelation 12:3 says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and 10 horns and seven crowns upon his head this power was\n\n(12:16) going to make war against another system of on Earth obviously representing God's people and so there is a dragon and it attacks the woman in white and this war will continue until the coming of Christ so the Bible says so this creature that we found in Revelation 13 that came out of the sea tell uh tells us what the\n\n(12:44) attributes of the papal power are because this is a system that has all the attributes of the little horn power in Daniel chapter 7 so it is the same system and it tells us that it has Meo Persian components because it has the feet of the bear it has Greek philosophy in it which tells us the whole Evolution\n\n(13:08) Theory by the way is based on Greek philosophy and comes from there it has Greek components in it and then it has the 10 horns which represent this final power which would control eventually the whole world so heads of lions with 10 horns and a woman is of course the church itself the ecclesiastical arm\n\n(13:39) controlling all the political Powers decked in purple and red and holding this cup in her hand I saw a woman sit upon a Scarlet colored Beast full of the names of blasy blasphemy Revelation 17:3 and the purple and the Scarlet colors and the gold and the precious stones Rome is the richest Church institution in the entire world the\n\n(14:06) treasures that are in the Vatican Museum Boggle the mind it is unbelievable and in this golden cup there are all these Abominations of her false teachings now we have already seen that she is called mystery now something that is a mysterious or mystery is something that works behind the scenes that is\n\n(14:32) secret and she is the mother mysteriously so of all the other harlots as well does she control all the churches in the world that are apostate towards God is that a possibility here well we' haven't looked into that issue in great detail yet but we'll come to that in another lecture Revelation 17:5 the old Babylonian religion and the\n\n(15:02) old bull cult all of these these ancient religions we will find all these aspects in Rome 2 Timothy 4:4 says they will turn away from listening to the truth and give their attention to Legends so the church would eventually succumb and instead of believing in Salvation through the Lamb of God that was SA sacrificed for the sins of the\n\n(15:30) world they will have all kinds of Notions which will satisfy their own egos Psalms 116:13 says I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord so which is our choice are we going to use the systems of the world and be comfortable or are we going to call upon the name of the Lord and be ostracized\n\n(15:58) that's the choice that we have the Tower of Babel a woman calling herself Babylon or the Bible calls her Babylon and all these features fit together second Thessalonians talks about this mystery in chapter 2: 7-10 for this mystery of iniquity does already work so this steal full work working was already\n\n(16:29) working in the time when this was written when Paul penned these words this power was already working only he who now leth will let until he is taken out of the way and then shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what does that mean and shall destroy with the\n\n(16:56) brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth but that they might be saved powerful text tells us the circumstances\n\n(17:22) of the rise of this Antichrist system and it tells us that there was something holding it back so basically we could read this as he who holds it back will be taken out of the way and then shall this wicked one be revealed so something is holding it back the system which was already working in in the time of Paul\n\n(17:50) but it would be taken away and then the system would rise and it would work with lying wonders deceivableness un un righteousness and it will deceive the whole world taking away the truth from people let's have a look at this tremendous reference in Paul's writings regarding the man of sin now we beseech\n\n(18:16) you Brethren by by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that day of Christ is at hand Jesus is not coming yet that he said Jesus is not here as some of you\n\n(18:41) think he's not coming yet it's not soon that is coming let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed so Jesus's coming will not happen until there is a falling away and the man of sin is revealed the son of ption interesting word the son of\n\n(19:15) ption used only twice in the Bible did you know that used only twice in the Bible only two have been called sons of pedition the one is this man of sin this system and the other one was Judas now if I'd like to ask you how did Judas betray Jesus with a kiss so did he present himself as one of them yes or\n\n(19:49) no isn't it possible that this system the son of petion will also present himself as a representative of Jesus Christ and betray everyone with a kiss isn't it possible who opposes and exalt himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sits in the temple of God showing himself that he is\n\n(20:15) God and we saw that the papacy actually did that and this is that Spirit of antichrist whereof we have heard that it should come even now already is in the world one John 4:3 so this power was working in the time of John and in the time of the Apostles this is not some future power there as many believe that\n\n(20:40) will come uh sometime in the future as futurism teachers in the world out there remember ye not Paul continues that when I was yet with you I told you these things and and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time so Paul said to them I told you that something was withholding the\n\n(21:12) Antichrist preventing it from developing and you know what it is for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he that now leth will let until he be taken out of the way the the uh BBE translation says there is one who is keeping back that evil till he is taken out of the way so something was withholding this power from rising and\n\n(21:41) when that something has been taken away then the Antichrist will come and then shall the wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so God will fight against the system with the word of God and finally will destroy it at\n\n(22:00) his coming that's a promise even him whose coming is after the working of Satan and we have this text again of how he works so when will this Antichrist Ares Paul told them that something was withholding we don't have the facts here as to what it was so here gratian Guinness romanism and the Reformation writes here we have a point\n\n(22:24) on which Paul affirms the existence of knowledge in the Christian church the early church knew he says what the hindrance was the early church tells us what it did know upon the subject and no one in these days can be in a position to contradict its testimony as to what Paul had by Word of Mouth only told the\n\n(22:48) Thessalonians today we are saying what hindered it it was the Holy Spirit it was that it was that it was the other no we don't know because Paul is the only one who told them what was hindering it it is a point on which ancient tradition alone can have authority modern speculation is positively impertinent on\n\n(23:07) such a subject that makes sense can the early church fathers tell us what Paul had told them what was holding it back tullian on the resurrection chapter 24 this was written 200 a says the following he who now hinders must hinder and until he be taken out of the way what obstacle is there but the Roman\n\n(23:31) State the falling away of which by being scattered into 10 kingdoms s introduce Antichrist interesting so that's what the early church fathers understood that when Rome finally collapses then Antichrist will come that's what they believed let continue John Chom homy on 2 Thessalonians that was Bishop of\n\n(23:58) constant anop 390 says only there is one that restrain now until he be taken out of the way that is when the Roman Empire is taken out of the way then he Antichrist shall come there's another one that says it interesting well Paul says the power was already working then and sooner or later he will arise\n\n(24:21) there's something hindering it but when it goes I told you what it was then it'll arise here is Edward ell Elliot commentary on the apocalypse and it says we have the consenting testimony of the early fathers from IRAs the disciple of St John down to Chom and Jerome to the effect that it was understood to be the\n\n(24:40) Imperial power ruling and residing at Rome that had to be taken out of the way Gran Guinness says while the Caesars held Imperial power it was impossible for the predicted Antichrist to arise on the fall of the Caesars he would arise that makes sense the biblical prophecies make sense the 1,260 day prophecy makes sense if you\n\n(25:04) look at all of these issues and uh while the Caesars held Imperial power he would arise on the fall of the Caesars he would arise grat and Guinness romanism and the Reformation there are numerous that uh sources that say this Paul did not identify the restraining power which they knew to be Rome for fear of\n\n(25:27) reprisals remember the Christian church was under P persecution by Rome so Paul wrote them an epistle and he said what I told you personally you know what it is that must first happen so don't go teaching all kinds of doctrines we're waiting for the falling away the man of sin the obstacle to be taken away the\n\n(25:47) man of sin will arise and then he will rule on this Earth and then only eventually will Christ come and he will consume this power when he returns that's the biblical version 1 Timothy 3:16 Says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh will you notice that God was manifest In\n\n(26:15) the Flesh let's not change that justified in the spirit seen of the Angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into Glory that's the only mystery in Christianity no other mystery we will never comprehend how the god of the universe could have become man for us died for us and then save us and make us\n\n(26:47) Sons and Daughters of the most high it's a mystery we'll never understand that everything else has been revealed in its fullness but this will remain our study for all eternity that is the mystery of godliness the mystery of iniquity wants to undo this Salient Eternal Central fact of Salvation and we have already seen in\n\n(27:15) the lectures how the efforts have been made to reduce the workings of Jesus Christ and how through the secret societies the ancient Babylonian religion through cabalism and gnosticism remove Jesus Christ as the deity that saves and replaces it with another Power we've seen the Islamic secret societies and we\n\n(27:39) see what seen what the Quran teaches that Jesus was not the Son of God that he never died that his blood was not shed for us that he was whisked away that he's spiritualized he never came in the flesh all of these issues we see this is the very Cent doctrine of Rome today and is the Theology of the Vulgate the Templars the rosac crucians\n\n(28:06) the Jesuits Freemasonry all of them hold to the central Doctrine two doctrines in the world not 100 not 200 not 300 and not 500 two doctrines in the world all wearing different cloaks all controlled by one power and where we saw the woman with this nice little minis skirt you thought the minis skirt was something\n\n(28:32) new no no no it is very old there it is and uh well this lady of I don't know whether she was a lady of the night or a lady of the day but this lady with a golden cup in her hand represents the worship of baale and fides how fascinating sa Del vaticano fides we saw very interesting he has the meaning of the worship of the\n\n(29:05) Goddess the initiates The Insider initiates were the fides and we wouldn't know what that was we didn't have this nice quote from Albert G Macky 33 degree Freemason which says the right hand as in all ages been deemed an emblem of fidelity and our ancient Brethren worship deity under the name of fides or\n\n(29:29) Fidelity which was sometimes represented by two right hands joined which is also what um Freemasonry does and sometimes by two human figures holding each other by the right hand Numa was the first who erected the altar to fides under which name the goddess of Oaths and honesty was worshiped obligations taken in her\n\n(29:51) name were considered as more inviolable than any others here's a mystery we are showing you one side but we actually teach another morals and Dogma page 292 you will recall we had the secret symbols where we had the PX over here which is on so many preaching rosters and pulpits and altars today and it's given\n\n(30:16) Christian connotations for the goam for the cumans but here The Insider himself tells us it is the staff of Osiris so it is the representation of the male member that sits in the boat fine and he also told us that uh the various other symbols that we see over here are pagan symbols the towel and uh this cross over\n\n(30:45) here and the swastikas this way or the other way and the stars of David and then this interesting statement the vestments of the priests of Horus were covered with these crosses and then you have the males cross and I showed you that the papacy has this on its vestments and the Bishops wear it as well these are\n\n(31:10) priests of Horus that's a mystery you have to look behind the scenes to find it the MIT that they wear on their head that today looks that represents actually the fish head of the god Dagon which means Doug on is the fish God so the fish head later the cape was removed the fish Cape it was replaced with a red cloak or a\n\n(31:37) purple cloak or whatever color but the MIT with the open Fish Head On Top remained there you see in Babylonian relief in the pagma museum you see the fish with the open mouth the miter on the head of the priests of Babylon and here they had pales with water water and they had little branches of hisop that\n\n(32:00) they put in and they sprinkled it upon the waters and this is exactly what the papacy does the Bishops walk with their holy water the pope has a branch of hisop and he sprays the people this is Babylonian ritual this is cleansing through bab L bab the gate L God Babel Babel portal to God Jesus says I am the door I am the gate Jesus is the\n\n(32:34) gate there's only one way to heaven and that is through acknowledging our sinfulness and accepting the vicarious sacrifice of the Son of God who died for us that's the only way there is to salvation but Babel says no we have another portal to God that's a fascinating story we're going to have a look at that in another lecture do you\n\n(32:57) know how many Bobs there are in the world today oh they all call themselves Bob sa bab Bob oh you name it lots of Bobs out there we better watch out for all the Bobs only one Bob that leads to God and that's Jesus only one gate only one portal but here's another form of cleansing Jesus says I will sprinkle you with his so papacy\n\n(33:25) says no no no I'll do it you'll be saved through the system no other way two ideologies Clash the priests they were bowed down to their slippers were kissed their Rings were kissed this is paganism there's the sign of shamash which you will find everywhere in the world today unbelievable where you will find the\n\n(33:51) signs of shamash the gnostics founded by Simon Magus who according to leas Levi became sorcerer to Nero history Lea Magi page 199 these are the very prominent Sorcerers Levi you know people like to have that name on the back of their whatever you know very prominent and if you go to Rome this is a symbol that you will find over there\n\n(34:21) this is uh outside of that ancient Pagan Temple where all uh religions were honored and on the bottom you have the square which is Masonic then you have the elephant on top of that and then you have this symbol on top with a cross on top and it everybody says that looks very nice unless you know of course that\n\n(34:45) the square is the symbol or the cube of the ancient deities and that the LF is the alpha the LF the first letter the elephant which is the Bull of the East so in Hinduism they still have the LF as the symbol of the sun god the first one in the Hebrew it is the ball and on top of it the missing piece of\n\n(35:17) Osiris and on top of that the towel so you have the full catastrophy of pagan Worship in this symbol over here in Catholicism and crimson and purple are the colors isn't it fascinating that they believe that we have the knowledge of Good and Evil so we will find that the pope will always be dressed in white\n\n(35:42) he represents the white side the luciferian side and his side man he is sidekick if you like the one who is the military dictator of all of this will wear which color black so the head of the Jesuit order always wears black so that you have both sides of the knowledge of Good and Evil and the woman was arrayed in purple and\n\n(36:12) scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of the Abominations of the filthiness of her fornication strong language if you take the paple crown the paper Triple Crown that comes from meido Persia if you had that Crown alone you could probably get\n\n(36:34) all the debt out of the United States of America if you sold it and the priests that uh officiate they have the same colors and they of course here celebrate the mass which is the literal sacrificing of Jesus Christ again and again and again and again see on the papal Throne before the main altar in St Peter's Pope Paul\n\n(37:00) listens to Cardinal Sun's famous sermon on Pope John delivered during the second session of the council the sermon began there was a man sent from God whose name was John very interesting what happened at the second Council well at the second Council all were invited again Into The Sisterhood of the churches except that Rome would\n\n(37:26) be the mother and everybody else could remain a sister isn't that interesting interesting idolatry was the The Worship in the old system idolatry is the same Worship in the present system exactly the same but idolatry takes many forms idolatry doesn't mean just bowing down to a statue idolatry could mean something\n\n(37:54) else as well and wouldn't it be interesting if we knew that Rome actually controlled that aspect as well in its totality completely and utterly well we cannot today go into all the systems of idolatry that would be impossible but uh idolatry does not mean just bowing down to an idol you could have different Idols what about World\n\n(38:19) Sports and who controls World Sports well if you look at the symbols that they have every single one of these super clubs has a Masonic symbol it's very interesting the greatest football team in the world Manchester United even uses the devil directly why not sounds good to me Masonic ladders Masonic sh\n\n(38:46) Chevrons signs of shamash why not these are the greatest teams in the world and what about all of these we have animals of of Darkness we have uh flying horses which is Pegasus we have all these interesting symbols with pentagrams and uh Shields of Malta and sun symbols and pentagrams and double-headed lions and goats all the\n\n(39:17) symbols and FES you name it we have it Masonic M Masonic anchors the whole shooting match the Masonic fingers the um skull and bones Titan is actually Satan's Greek name so we have all these interesting features the G anybody who's a Freemason will know that that comes from the Masonic Lodge if we go to\n\n(39:44) Exodus chapter 32: 2-6 and Aaron said to them break off the Golden Earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters well today earrings are very popular and bring them to me he made a golden C and Aaron made Proclamation and said tomorrow is a feast of Jehovah and they rose up early the next\n\n(40:11) day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and drink and Rose up to play now what did they play what did you think they played well part of the system of sun worship was to play sports what kind of sport did they play that's very interesting well let's go to\n\n(40:37) UNESCO they should know because the UNESCO um manifest as you know was written by a skull and bones member so he must be an interesting Insider and he writes for example Polo was known to the Persians and restored to its original Sun game significance by Akbar scoring a goal with a sunball was equated with a\n\n(41:03) Triumph of light over Darkness good over evil but remember that masonry calls light darkness and darkness light and calls Jesus and Jehovah evil so the Triumph of light over Darkness represented in paganism the Triumph of Lucifer over Jesus Christ so the Triumph of Darkness over Darkness good over evil\n\n(41:33) the ball is the sun symbol in all such Sports as football hockey basketball Cricket baseball is related to the sun and the sun dial shape and the pattern of the field as well as its rules of play and scoring like all sports baseball also embodies the sun's seasonal cycle in much the same way as ancient ceremonial contests were held as\n\n(41:56) part of f ility rights so if you can't get them to the church get them to the sports field isn't that interesting and in the church you see the arms going like this and on the sports field you see the arms going like this hymns are sung in the church hymns of a different nature are sung over there it's quite\n\n(42:19) fascinating who cares as long as he has worship suian gilgames story inscribed in uniform tab narrates how the sporting equipment a stick and a ring or a ball which gilgames had carved out of the uprooted tree had fallen into The Nether world as he began oppressing his people by repeated athletic competitions now\n\n(42:40) eventually it was the Sun God who opened a hole in the ground in order to recover them so if you had a stick and you had a ball if you took the stick and you got the ball into the hole that was a simp it has a deeper meaning than what we really believe actually it's quite a meaning but forget about that that's\n\n(43:02) what golfers do for example you know it's amazing and how often we are told that this is marvelous and it's good for Christianity and all these things I have nothing against Sports sport is a good Recreation sport is good for exercise there are things that you can do with sport that are good but if sport becomes\n\n(43:22) a religion isn't that a problematic isn't that idolatry the Olympic torch which the runner carries to Mark the sun's cyclic movement through the Olympiad the four-year period until the next games is also related to the sun cyclic Rhythm first celebrated in Greece the name was ceremonial contest non ofus\n\n(43:43) did you see the opening ceremony now the Greek one didn't they honor the gods yes or no yes and we go off we go well Sun Moon and other planets float over Barcelona Olympic Games The Sons association with sports predates the deities herles and Apollo in Greece as is evident from the Epic tale of the samian Hill hero\n\n(44:10) gilgames fascinating stuff as in sport the sun is omnipresent on practically all aspects of life whether it be art architecture philosophy religion festivals folklore dance music wow he's got every base covered every morning a pagan god of the day wakes us up for the Romans in the early Century of Christian era named\n\n(44:32) each day after the seven planets Sun Moon Mars Mercury Jupiter Venus and Saturn if we look at the symbols of the Olympics you'll see they've got baladad symbol baladad symbol baladad symbol baladad symbol baladad symbol you can find them all over there this is paganism here is a young man bringing a\n\n(44:58) fine hockey shirt to the pope let's see what he will do with it a fine hockey shirt wow that's a blessed CH so Freemasonry controls all these issues for Rome today the sporting world the religious world this is fascinating I wonder how much idolatry is hidden in the mystery and how much more the Bible wants to reveal about\n\n(45:40) this amazing story of Revelation 17 this is a picture of St John's ltin now St John's Lan is the main Church in Rome not St Peters that's where the papacy is active and does all its major things but this is where the pope is crowned and this is where he speaks ex cathedra uh again please note that it's\n\n(46:10) called St John's remember I've told you before about the St John's secret of the Templars and how they were johnen nightes yans nightes if you like the wine of a fornication the mother of the churches iMat eclesia Revelation 175 says she is the mother of prostitutes Revelation 18:7 says I sit as Queen I am not a widow I will never\n\n(46:42) mourn and Isaiah 47:8 says I am that's God and there is none beside me I will never be a widow or suffer loss of children so if church is separated from her maybe she'll get them back she says I will not suffer loss Dominos other churches are no sisters of ours the Vatican insists September 5 2000 the\n\n(47:10) independent well the Church of Rome fulfills every single prophecy it must always be clear that the one Holy Catholic and Apostolic universal church is not the sister but the mother of all the churches Cardinal ratzinger 94 2000 he makes it pretty plain Cardinal ratzinger is the head for the foundation\n\n(47:34) of Doctrine and Faith which is the old Inquisition definition of incredulity heresy apostasy there is no Graver offense than heresy and therefore it must be rooted out with fire and the sword that's what the Catholic encyclopedia said in 1911 the Catholic catechism says incredulity is the neglect of revealed\n\n(47:58) truth or the willful refusal to Ascent to it heresy is the obstinate post-baptismal denial of some truth which must be believed with Divine and Catholic faith so if the pope has said something and you say I don't believe it you're heretic must be rooted out with fire and the sword well protestantism\n\n(48:19) said that I don't want to accept that anymore it said I will not believe it and so the Western Watchmen in 19 194 said protestantism is not a religion never was a religion the most that could be said about it was that was a form of rape and robbery masquerading as a religion there was a problem there the\n\n(48:41) Council of Trent called by Pope Paul III between 1545 and 1563 met in three sessions Protestants were present during the second meeting I'll be dealing with this in a greater detail in another uh lecture but it's fascinating to see that the council reaffirmed the doctrines disputed by the reformists every single Doctrine and\n\n(49:06) there was a specific reason why they did so why the Reformation lost at the Council of Trent fascinating story but it's too long to discuss now doctrines reaffirmed with transubstantiation that the body of Christ literally is formed during the mass justification by faith and works the medieval Mass was upheld the second\n\n(49:30) seven sacraments celibacy doctrine of purgatory we see this now in the modern Bibles reaffirmed again indulgences were reaffirmed and Papal power was increased so all power now in one man so after the Council of Trent truly there was all power in one man which is called ultramontanism and truly the pope\n\n(49:58) represents as the man of sin which is transgression of the law well what if you change the law then you not only transgress it you have the audacity to change it so here we have a full system as the Bible says it would be transubstantiation marvelous Dignity of the priests in their hands as in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary the Son\n\n(50:24) of God becomes incarnate behold the power of the priest the tongue of the priest makes God from a morsel of bread it is more than creating the world so they feel pretty good about that Canon one says if anyone this is Council of Tren session 13 if anyone denies that in the sacrament of the most holy Eucharist are contained truly\n\n(50:46) really substantially the body and blood together with the soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ and consequently the whole Christ but says that he only in it is a in a sign or a figure or a force let him be in anatha there's a problem I'm not going to along go along with that because Jesus Christ was\n\n(51:09) sacrificed because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy Hebrews 10:14 so I have a problem with this statement so when we celebrate the mass in the Roman Catholic sense this is not remember remembering the Lord till he comes this is wine of her fornication right or wrong and what it does it Nails\n\n(51:36) Jesus Christ Jesus Christ to the Cross perpetually he stays there all the time he's crucified again and again and again and again that's why the symol too is the crucifix because that's they where they would like Jesus to stay on the cross but my Jesus is no longer on a cross he is in heaven and he is coming\n\n(52:04) back as king of kings and Lord of lords remember the Forgiveness of sins Luke 5:21 blasphemy if you say that you as a man can forgive sin forgiveness of sins the son of man has Authority on Earth to forgive sins he said to the paralytic I say to you arise and take up up your cot and go to your house Jesus\n\n(52:28) proved that he had that Authority but the priest has the power of the keys the power of delivering sinners from hell and making them worthy of paradise and by changing them from slaves of Satan into children of God God himself is obliged obligated to abide by the Judgment of his priests and either not\n\n(52:45) to Pardon or to Pardon we saw that yesterday these are wine doctrines of fornication Mary the mediatrix now Jesus disappears 18 54 Pope Pas declared Mary Immaculate 1951 he defined and enforced the doctrine of the bodily assumption to Mary Catholic Layman says The Sinner that Ventures directly to Christ may\n\n(53:10) come with Dread and apprehension of his WTH but let him only employ the mediation of the Virgin with her son and she has only to show that son the breasts that gave him suck and his wroth will immediately be appeased what a stupid Doctrine it's really disgusting I could show you slides where I've been in the milk Grotto anybody\n\n(53:30) know about the milk Grotto in uh Bethlehem where the milk of Mary is squirted up against the walls and it's a holy Place authenticated by the pope this is ancient fertility right paganism imagine a son today if the mother was angry with him or he was angry with her mother and she Beed her breast what would he think you think\n\n(53:57) well have you gone insane that is paganism this is fertility cult these are statements by the Catholic saints he falls and he lost who has no not recourse to Mary Mary is called the gate hold it Jesus says I am the door there's no other way says Jesus Gate of Heaven because no one can enter that blessed\n\n(54:23) Kingdom without passing through her the way of Salvation is open to none otherwise than through Mary the salvation of all depends on the being favored and protected by Mary he who is protected by Mary will be saved he who will Who is not will be lost our Salvation depends on thee God will not save us without the intercession of\n\n(54:43) Mary well tell us is that not wine of his fornication the Pope says Mary must be a goddess Maria then the the dogma of the Assumption we dealt with this issue I'm just showing it to you now in Revelation to see how it all fits together we've dealt with all these issues already tradition infallibility and the\n\n(55:10) scriptures Bonaventure Henwood papal uh spokesman more answers to your questions tells us that the pope is infallible the Bible we've dealt with this issue the index of prohibited books the text receptus is prohibited but the Jesuit version is not well we dealt with this issue we had a whole lecture on it isn't this wine of\n\n(55:39) his fornication isn't this making Jesus less than he is seant was made for the alexandrian library here is this uh Theologian Paul nter who is he Paul nter served as Divine word missionary before assuming position at zavia University where is President presently professor of theology where the study at the\n\n(56:04) pontifical Gregorian University that's the biggest Jesuit university in Rome and studied under Carl Rana who was kalana kalana was the Jesuit who was put in charge of making all the churches subject to Rome again we'll be dealing with that in a later lecture he writes a book no other name and then he goes to show that you can be\n\n(56:29) saved any way you want to any way you want to whatever you want to be saved by go for it hello isn't this wine of a fornication world religion Masonic signals Dal Lamas crosses bent crosses did you know that that's the same cross that Satanist sues with an emaciated Jesus on there with a V sign over there the Masonic\n\n(57:00) triangle hanging on this bent cross this is luciferianism and they use IHS they say it means hominum salvator some say it means any service no it means Isis Horus sep the Egyptian Trinity if you look at the the outer court it's a circle within a circle a wheel within a wheel it is the eight spokes of the wheel of the\n\n(57:30) solar system or the solar deities with the Osiris missing part right in the middle fascinating Mitra killing the bull victory over evil evil remember esoterically is f defined as Jesus here's the structure of the cult members went through seven grades Each of which had special symbol of tuto planet from\n\n(57:56) the lowest of the highest it was corx the Raven and the Mercury nyus notice this interesting nyus a madeup word meaning male bride under Venus that means when you were initiated into this priesthood you became a male bride celibate does Rome do that yes but as the male bride you do not have to be as celibate as something so\n\n(58:24) let's not go into those details else mes the soldier on the Mars Leo the Lion under Jupiter persus the Persian under Luna the moon hel odris the sun's Kua under sa the son and finally P father under Saturn it was possible for mithraic initiate to be a member of more than one cult women were not permitted to become\n\n(58:45) members this is Catholicism Roman Catholicism is mitraismo arm the these are the wondering Bishops they control occultism in the world the Deep secrets of the occults all things to all men there the pope receives the tilak he receives the bindii the red mark on the foret which is the sign of CA and CA is\n\n(59:16) Lucifer and here he kisses the Quran all things to all men the Bible says Revelation 17:2 with whom the king of the Earth have committed fornication well here they are from the fall Lea in front of the Pope we look at the kings of the world that have created Havoc upon this planet dealings with the papacy we see the gorbach offs with the\n\n(59:45) papacy we see the so-called dictators with the papacy actually part and parcel of it why do they always wear black when they visit is it the pope because they have to reflect the two sides of the Masonic Story the knowledge of Good and Evil the queen of the buer burgers Prince Phillip will have some\n\n(1:00:06) interesting things to say about him Prince Charles in his black with the white Pope and here we have the equivalence in the Islamic World black tie at least he's got that on and black socks there is Margaret thatcha there is Kart the Japanese the bush and the blares do the kings of the world work with this system yes or no is there\n\n(1:00:33) any system on this planet that qualifies like this system ignio SLA under them together and if you thinking about voting sh well that simply means that the battle will between this young man over here and this young man over here and they're both skull and bolds members so who cares who wins the next election who\n\n(1:01:02) cares Revelation 176 and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus that's Revelation 176 well there it is Bartholomew KN the valenzas the 30-year War the 100e war the Bloodshed Stalin you name it what they did to God's people unbelievable they slaughtered them left\n\n(1:01:27) right and center the Inquisition Thomas Aina said the convicted heretic should be put to death as surely as other criminals the Catholic church is a respector of conscience and of Liberty nevertheless when confronted with heresy she has recourse to force to corporal punishment to torture she lit in Italy\n\n(1:01:47) the funeral piles of the Inquisition this is the only system that qualifies we've already dealt with a Jesuit oath I'm not going to read that oath again the terrible tortures for heresy Who Shall Believe and practice what they want to decide for themselves deciding for oneself what one Shall Believe Revelation 17 gives us more\n\n(1:02:12) information Revelation 17:7 and the angel said unto me wherefore did thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which has the seven heads and the 10 h so let's discuss it a little bit more the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend the Lamb\n\n(1:02:36) of God once was then he was not and then he will come again isn't that right so it's a counterfeit of Christ this system puts itself in the place of Jesus Christ so this political power this Beast which thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out with the bottomless pit and go into ption and they that dwell on the Earth\n\n(1:03:02) shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is that's an interesting statement there's been much speculation on this and let's try and unravel it and see if we can come up with something I don't want to\n\n(1:03:20) be dogmatic but let's see what we can get is not stage in 1798 the Beast received a mortal wound is that correct so the Beast once was it ruled over the Middle Ages then it is not it died it seemed to have a mortal wound and then it will come again is that right so let's look at this East not stage 1798 it received a mortal wound\n\n(1:03:53) what did it do in secretly cland steinle when it was supposedly dead well 1854 the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1870 infallibility in 1929 he crowned himself Sovereign ruler of the world 1951 the Assumption of Mary current Mary is Advocate mediator and co-redeemer that's totally replacing Jesus Christ What A system that\n\n(1:04:20) developed in that time Revelation 179 and here is the the mind which has wisdom the seven heads are Seven Mountains oros mountain on which the woman sth now besides the fact that Rome is built on Seven Hills that is an interesting point there are other issues as well the number seven is also part of\n\n(1:04:45) those kingdoms remember and there are seven Kings so now we have a king and a kingdom coming together five are Fallen one is the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space and the Beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and E of the seven and goes into ption that's a\n\n(1:05:11) jawbreaker for those who like Puzzles let's have a look at the heads or mountains in the Bible they symbolize empires not individual Kings and I will Render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of CA all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight says the Lord behold I am against you oh\n\n(1:05:33) destroying Mountain says the Lord which destroyeth all the Earth and I will stretch out my hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt Mountain this is a reference to Babylon that was going to attack God's people so a mountain is a kingdom so let's identify the seven heads now I don't intend to be dogmatic\n\n(1:06:00) at all and I don't believe it's a question of Salvation whether you have it right or whether you don't questions of Salvation refer to your relationship with Jesus Christ and nothing else so whether we have them exactly right or not it doesn't really matter but God gives us information let's look at it\n\n(1:06:21) it's interesting interpretation one if we look look at it from the time of John the seven heads represent the principal persecuting powers of God's people over the ages this is one interpretation five have fallen they say Egypt Assyria Babylon met Persia and Greece five are Fallen one is well looking at it from\n\n(1:06:52) the time of John that would be Rome the is not yet come that's the papacy that's one interpretation that's quite popular and many people adhere to it and I have no problem if anybody wants to adhere to it because we end up with this final power which obviously is the one that causes all the problems the only problem\n\n(1:07:15) that I have with this interpretation is which powers do you leave out over here because Egypt Assyria Babylon meta Persia GRE Greece are the ones that are mentioned and you're starting with the time of John so that's an assumption you make in order to unravel this prophecy but which ones do you leave out for\n\n(1:07:36) example if you go to Ezekiel 1626 and you look at the enemies of God you had the Egyptians you had the Philistines you had the Assyrians you had the calans so in that interpretation the Philistines for example are left out what if I didn't want to leave them out then my numbers would be wrong right right so personally I don't have a\n\n(1:08:00) problem with the main structure but the details don't quite satisfy me identification of the seven heads interpretation two using Daniel now as a template which seems to be logical because the Book of Revelation uses the symbolism in The Book of Daniel to transfer it to this situation that it describes in\n\n(1:08:24) Revelation so using Daniel as a template some start with Babylon and count from the time of the events portrayed in Revelation 17 so again you have to make a decision now where do we start with the events starting in Revelation 17 five have fallen Babylon Meo Persia Greece Rome papacy one is the Wounded papacy now you're\n\n(1:08:53) starting with the time in Revelation 17 where he says one is so that's the time so they get to Babylon mid Persia Greece Rome papacy one is that would be the wounded papacy not yet come would be the final Confederacy under the papacy because his mortal wound will heal and all the world will follow him so that's a nice\n\n(1:09:18) interpretation I have no major problem with that I only have one little question what about the other powers mentioned in the Book of Revelation how do you fit them in then then you have to leave out some of the other beasts the two horn beast and uh all of those so what do we do to incorporate them and\n\n(1:09:41) the angel said unto me wherefore did thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman and of the Beast that carrieth her which has seven heads and 10 horns the Beast which they saw was is not shallice where does it descend from bottomless pit ah now which other Beast descended from the bottomless\n\n(1:10:05) pit the one in Revelation 11 remember that the one that starts making war on the word of God the whole philosophy of the French Revolution all of that going to bition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundations of the World when they\n\n(1:10:24) behold the Beast that that was is not yet is seven Kings five are fallen and then you have this little bit of information here and the other is not yet come and when he comes he must continue a short space and the Beast that was and is not even he is the E and ease of the seven and goes into pedition ah little bit more detail so\n\n(1:10:48) the eighth he goes into pedition but actually the eighth is part of the seven let's fit that together interpretation number three using Daniel as a template let's start with Babylon and count from the time of the events portrayed in Revelation 17 so much like the previous one so five are fall Babylon me Persia\n\n(1:11:17) Greece Rome papacy that's a religio political power that ruled over the Middle Ages so that's where you get to starting with the events portrayed in Revelation 17 one is a seemingly wounded papacy is not it says yet is it seemed to have a mortal wound do you remember that and we saw that it actually grew\n\n(1:11:46) and that the Jesuit organizations built up a whole world Empire in that time communism all these things developed in this not EAS stage so seemingly wounded papacy is not yet that's a nonreligious religio political Powers Run by secret papal societies arising from the bottomless pit in Revelation 11 that's\n\n(1:12:12) what happened during the not yet phase not yet come the image of the beast that's the religio political Confederacy under the lambl likee Beast the eighth e of the seven that would be a new world order a final world Confederacy under the papacy now this one is not much different from the previous one and\n\n(1:12:39) whether we like the previous one or this one it doesn't really matter to me personally that's how I would like to put it together myself but I'm not hooked on it I mean it doesn't really matter as long as the final one ends up to be the papacy because he arrived then and he goes to ption but this one for me\n\n(1:12:59) includes all the images that we have in the Book of Revelation so this is what I presume it might mean and the 10 horns which thou sawest are 10 Kings which have received no Kingdom as yet so if this is this stage where we're talking this is not stage and there are 10 that have not yet received the kingdom then that that's future then\n\n(1:13:25) what does this 10 stand for but receive power as kings one hour with the Beast there must be some Confederacy so 10 could mean the number of completeness all the kingdoms of the world giving their power to the Beast or it could be something else these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto\n\n(1:13:46) the Beast and these shall make war with the lamb this is the persecuting power at the end and the lamb Shall Overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they are with him and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful so here's the final battle that will take place on September 17\n\n(1:14:11) 1973 the club of Rome published a special highly confidential report called the regionalized and adaptive model of the global World System fasc stuff which was sent to the power elite to be implemented this document reveals that the club has divided the world into 10 political economic regions which it\n\n(1:14:39) refers to as kingdoms a designation that tracks eerily with the terminology used in The Book of Revelation chapter 131 to2 in 1974 the authors of the report M mazic blah blah blah blah pestel published their final findings in a book mankind at the turning point however in this book which is intended for public\n\n(1:15:02) consumption they have dropped the word Kingdom this comes from a very good source and root to Global occupation Gary H car so the world is being divided into 10 regions did you know that there are certain monarchies left and certain royal families in the world some interesting stuff that we might be\n\n(1:15:23) talking about in the next lectures to come and he says unto me the waters which thou sawest where the horse sitters are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues the 10 horns which thou sest upon the Beast these shall hate the and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with\n\n(1:15:48) fire wow so first we have the kingdoms of the world giving their power unto this Beast unto this religious system and then this religious system goes and makes war against God's people what happens next any idea God puts a hedge around his people he protects them he holds them in the palm of his hand just like he did in\n\n(1:16:21) Egypt and they legislate again against them they cannot buy they cannot sell they can do nothing your bread and your water shall be sure A thousand shall fall by your side 10,000 at your right hand it will not come near you all the promises of God apply eventually they try in their anger to eradicate this\n\n(1:16:48) group that clings to doctrines contrary to World doctrines and God sends plagues and there is much suffering on Earth and God's people are hedged eventually even these Powers realize that they have been what duped and they turn with bitter hatred and aggression and destroy the very one that tried to destroy God's people\n\n(1:17:23) that's what it says that's what it says fascinating stuff now notice very interestingly that they burn her with fire what was the punishment in the Old Testament for a hall that was caught in fornication she was stoned she was stoned to death but this one is burnt with fire what was the punishment for the daughter of a priest\n\n(1:17:57) that was caught in prostitution she was burnt isn't this interesting see the analogies boy the Bible is a fascinating book anybody tell me that humans thought this book up and I will tell you I will eat that Beamer and my computer if this is so for God has put it into their Hearts permissive will of God because these\n\n(1:18:27) kings are lost too to fulfill his will and to agree and to give their Kingdom unto the Beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reth over the kings of the Earth this great Babylon controlled by the of Babylon come hither I will show unto\n\n(1:18:48) thee the Judgment of the Great Hall that sth upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of a fornication that's the ending of the matter so my question to you tonight is do we fear the system to the point of obeying\n\n(1:19:09) it or do we cling to God what's our choice why would we be so stupid to go with the system if this is what's going to happen to the system we would be fools not to follow God besides the fact that God God has a beautiful character that never forces anyone and only draws that God is full of loving kindness and\n\n(1:19:35) gentleness why would I be so stupid to want to follow this system Jeremiah 50:24 says I have laid a snare for thee and thou has also taken o Babylon and thou was not aware thou art found and also caught because thou has striven against the law that was the typology the Lord has opened his Armory and has brought forth\n\n(1:19:59) the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the Lord God of hosts in the land of the calans come against her from the utmost border upon her storehouses cast her up his heaps and Destroy her utterly let nothing of her be left slay all her Bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them\n\n(1:20:21) for their day is come in the time of their visitation God is going to end that system the voice of them that flee and Escape out of the land of Babylon to declare in Zion the Vengeance of the Lord Our God the Vengeance of his Temple call together The Archers against Babylon all ye that bend the bow Camp\n\n(1:20:39) against it or roundabout let none thereof Escape nobody's going to escape this is the typology the final will be the antitype recompense her according to her work the millions that have died as a consequence of her according to all that she has done do unto her for she has been proud against the Lord against the\n\n(1:21:00) Holy One of Israel therefore shall her young men fall and all her Men of War shall be cut off in that day says the Lord behold I am against you oh thou Mouse thou most proud says the Lord God of hosts for thy day is come the time that I will visit thee this system is going to end and the most proud shall\n\n(1:21:21) stumble and fall and None Shall raise him up and I will Kindle a fire in its cities and it shall devour all around him amazing stuff their redeemer is strong these from Judah the children of Judah were oppressed together the children of God will be oppressed at the end of time and all that took them\n\n(1:21:42) captive held them fast they refus to let them go their redeemer is strong he's stronger than them the Lord of hosts is his name he shall thoroughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disqui the inhabitants of Babylon a sword is upon the caldan says the Lord and upon the inhabitants of Babylon and\n\n(1:22:03) Upon Our princes and Upon Our wise men none of their wisdom is going to help them Isaiah 26 says come my people enter thou into thy Chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyselves as as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpassed the Lord is going to punish Babylon and God's people\n\n(1:22:28) will be taken care of for behold the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity the Earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain there will be a resurrection Isaiah 26: 20 and 21 in that day the Lord with his sore and great strong sword will punish\n\n(1:22:53) leviatan the piercing serpent even leviatan that crooked Serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea that's the biblical story the most amazing story that has ever unfolded in the history of the worlds Revelation 191 and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying\n\n(1:23:17) Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord of our God for true and righteous are his judgments for has judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and has Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand isn't that fascinating Revelation 19:19 let's see what happens to her I saw the beasts and\n\n(1:23:43) the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army so here they come and the Beast Catholicism was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him well I can tell you who that was who was that that wrought the\n\n(1:24:06) Miracles before him it was the Protestant world it was in the United States that the fire came down and the Miracles were done and that the religious system the image of the Beast enforced the papal doctrines we've dealt with it might as well deal with it with which he deceived them that had received\n\n(1:24:26) the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His Image these both were cast Al into the lake of burning with Brimstone there's only one missing here that's the dragon he gets dealt with later and the remnant was slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth\n\n(1:24:44) and all the fowls were filled with their flesh Don't Mess With God you'll end up here Revelation 196 and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and is the voice of many W Waters as the voice of a mighty thunderings saying Allelujah for the Lord God omnipotent Reigns that's the end of the matter and we have nothing to\n\n(1:25:14) fear nothing in the next lecture we're going to look at the New World Order and we're going to look at some of these issues that are taking place place in the world today it is frightening stuff but nevertheless when you see these things happening lift up your eyes for you know that your Redemption draweth nigh trust\n\n(1:25:38) in the Lord Jesus and fear nothing amen thank [Music] you [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:221_a_new_world_order_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nNew World Order,Global Governance,9/11 Conspiracy,Economic Redistribution,Masonic Influence\n\n## Guide:\nThis source, \"A New World Order Total Onslaught,\" posits that a \"New World Order\" is being orchestrated by a global cabal of powerful individuals, including high-ranking Freemasons and the Papacy, to establish a unified world government. The speaker claims that major geopolitical events, such as the fall of communism and the September 11th attacks, were staged or manipulated to create chaos and fear, ultimately leading populations to willingly surrender their freedoms for the promise of order. A central theme is the alleged Catholic Church's long-standing economic doctrine, which advocates for the \"universal destination of goods\" and a redistribution of wealth, framing it as a subtle form of socialism or fascism that undermines private property rights. The speaker also emphasizes that diverse global leaders and organizations are secretly working towards this singular goal, with a particular focus on discrediting any form of Protestantism that resists papal authority.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 221 A New World Order Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLKZI08QBbg\n\n\n\n(00:00) oh we are now going to discuss this issue of a new world order as we saw in Revelation chapter 17 the kings of the world give their power unto the beast in the keys of this Blood Malachi Martin tells us that the greatest geopolitical giant of our age is the pope he says on his trip to Poland barely eight months after his election\n\n(01:36) he signaled the opening of the Millennium end game he became the first of three players to enter the new geopolitical Arena he says that Pope John Paul would stride on now in the arena of this endgame as something more than a geopolitical giant of his age he was and Remains the Serene and confident servant\n\n(01:56) of The Grand Design This is Masonic signal language here is John Paul 2 with the trilateral commission and here is John Paul 2 with Bai bit Jewish Freemasonry this is a fascinating signal picture with him in the center controlling the most powerful think tanks in the world because that's what the signal\n\n(02:23) tells us we saw in Revelation chap 17 already some pictures of the powers of the world giving themselves over to the papacy Le Vala being honored for his work with the host in public the bush gorbachov Summit in Malta George Bush referred to as a gateway to the Millennium of freedom and it was heralded as the building of a new\n\n(02:54) world it is a big idea in New World Order where diverse nations are drawn together in in common cause only the United States has both the moral standing and the means to back it up so they want to create this new world order Revelation chapter 13 said that the Beast that comes up out of the Earth would be the power that did it Bush\n\n(03:18) confirms that for us by 1990 a Peace Prize went to gorbachov for losing his country a man of the decade he became and the old symbols which are Masonic symbols of the East German Empire were removed the Communist emblem leaves petoran News August 20 1999 uh Summit meeting with 63 in 63 countries about\n\n(03:50) neoliberalism and Fidel Castro gives a masonic signal here he is with the papacy all these so-called countries that are against what the establishment stands for are only against in the sense that they are playing the game of hegelianism thesis antithesis but behind the scenes they all belong to the same\n\n(04:14) Club let's just verify that fiddle was significantly influenced by Jesuit father amondo lorento and Alberto decastro uh the Castro admired frro fiddle was very active in a Jesuit organization similar to the Boy Scout the Explorers wherever totalitarian movement erupts whether communist or Nazi a Jesuit can be found\n\n(04:38) in the role of advisor or leader in Cuba it was Castro's father father Amando lorente so forget about the idea that Cuba was anti-p a Jesuit was behind the scenes they were playing the game of thesis anti thesis when tyrants fall in Romania and Panama and all these countries these tyrants were put in place to create a\n\n(05:09) system of fear and chaos and then they are removed and the people are happy to give up their civil liberties we've already seen this video here of the Pope who receives honor from Bill Clinton for his uh role in ending the Communist Empire 2400 of his faithful here to welcome him he's waving to the crowd Archbishop rali is alongside the\n\n(05:52) pope as he shakes hands with the first lady we honor you for helping to lead a revolution of values and spirit and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union freeing Millions to live by conscience not coercion and freeing all of us from the constant fear of nuclear war your Holiness on behalf of all of us\n\n(06:14) gathered here today indeed on behalf of all the people of our beloved Nation we welcome you back to America ladies and gentlemen his Holiness Pope John Paul II and the vice president of the United States and Archbishop Pope declares the European Community Heaven Sent very fascinating Conrad Arawa who was the German\n\n(06:54) Chancellor at that particular time when this was being devised well he is to be declared a saint can you believe that he is to be declared a saint for his work Pope declares EU Heaven Saints and Saints at the moment Roman Catholic principles they are to be declared Saints now to bring about the European\n\n(07:19) Union they had mhr mhr is a Roman Catholic little town in a Protestant country in the Netherlands and the symbolism there was very interesting the 12 Stars they represent also the 12 stars that you have in the Book of Revelation which they apply to Mary rather than to the woman in white it is also fascinating that the\n\n(07:46) European Union issued a poster which was posted all over Europe where they had the Tower of bab under construction can you see that this was posted all over Europe and the stars were upside down representing the goat of Mendes this is Satanism this is the new Tower of Babel and uh the high French politicians said\n\n(08:13) we are building a new Babel which they emphasized with this poster and this time we will succeed the new parliament of the European Community is built like the Tower of Babel in fact it has a plaque on the inside or a poster which says precisely this and it has this scaffolding to give the appearance that\n\n(08:37) it is under construction this is rather arrogant this is the new European identity card and if you look at it at the back and you turn it upside down what do you see you see the goat of Mendes the horns are slightly modified to give another symbolism of the seat of the Earth but uh the inner facial features of the goat are very clearly\n\n(09:04) discernible and what these mean over here I would rather not say if we look at the high politicians of Europe those that played the role in all of this they are Masonic that is a masonic handshake between sha and call signifying the new Mason is taking over where the old mason is leaving so just as we saw that uh krie is a skull and\n\n(09:33) bones member in uh America now and the presentent president is a skull and bow member it doesn't me matter which one is going to win so here too Mason replaces Mason fingering the system they're all showing that they are all part of the same system when the Soviet Union fell the new emblem that it adopted was this\n\n(09:57) one the double-headed Eagle could you guess why well the double-headed Eagle is the symbol of Freemasonry and it obviously shows who is in control the Queens the kings of the world as we have seen all of them are high Masons and subject to the Roman pontiff and Islam we did a whole lecture to show the Intrigue of the Islamic\n\n(10:27) religion and the cathol religion that behind the scenes controlled by the secret societies they have one aim and one aim alone subject to Rome so what is all this war about with Islam who are these people who are pulling the strings in the world and why are people being rubbed up between them from the rock\n\n(10:56) stars of the world the Bonos of the world to the political leaders of the world everyone seems to be bowing down to the papal Caesar from the East to the West the Islamic world is currently being set up as the synthesis in the religious World pitted against the Judea Christian culture as the antithesis and\n\n(11:20) then out of this must come a sythesis where all of them will unite this is a website there is the the actual website underneath and this one I believe fairly accurately says who's who in the zoo Adam viop ather Pike carigi depont Harman beran Russell Ted Kennedy these are the illuminatis uh of yester year and today\n\n(11:51) George W bush of course he's a skull and bones member that's a suborganization of chapter 322 of a German organization the Illuminati therefore Bundi hapsburg Freeman tangui Hillary Clinton Alan Greenspan Rockefeller rild Walberg these are the bankers in the system the negotiators uh Lord Carrington Jimmy\n\n(12:19) Carter Henry Kissinger Lord David Owen Richard Holbrook these are 33 Freemason degree Freemasons or Knights of Malta or Builder Committee of 300 they all belong to the same Club if we look at uh Franklin de rusel cesil roads Engles all of these troski Stalin Marx Hoover all of their affiliations Grand Orient Lodge for\n\n(12:46) example Grand Orient Lodge uh lenon was Grand Orient Lodge Truman 33 degree vly brunt 33 degree Winston Churchill we've seen many of these before helmet call Committee of 300 Fran miton 33 degree Freemason he does he is not alive anymore Yak grain yasa arat 33 degree Freemason these are fascinating details\n\n(13:11) Shimon Perez Ronald Reagan George Bush Gerald Ford I showed you Gerald Ford's signature where he signed for himself that he was a 33 degree Freemason there it is I photographed it in the lodge and the Carters and these great political people in the world the Shas The Netanyahu the gorbachov there is Saddam\n\n(13:33) Hussein listed as a 33Â° Freemason now that is somewhat strange wouldn't you say King Hussein Al Gore Tony Blair all of these issues look at Saddam Hussein over there here's a picture of Saddam Hussein and this is a picture that was beamed on National Television during the war during the war of what he looked looked like now they\n\n(13:59) also said at that stage that they weren't sure whether this was pre-taped that means it could have been pre-taped before the war even took place because if they are insiders they would know who's who and what is going to happen now there is a very interesting rumor about this man have a look at his face\n\n(14:21) and have a look at the fact that he has no beard the CIA as well as the British secret service said at the time it could be a double it could be a double but nevertheless that is what was depicted he has always looked like this he's never had a beard this is what he's looked like then they find finally\n\n(14:43) Saddam Hussein's Hideout the filthy place they say and they arrest the man and show him on National Television after that one does not hear too much and he has a magnificent beard a magnificent beard now if the previous one was shot during the war then this must be the best hair fertilizer that mankind has\n\n(15:09) ever found maybe he could become a multis zillionaire patenting this fertilizer to make this beard grow as it is they used at least three doubles who knows who this man is and to say that they did blood tests who knows whether you can trust the bories that did this nevertheless He's listed as a 33Â° Freemason there is there are plenty of\n\n(15:35) questions regarding this man and uh there is no evidence except for his family that he's safely living in Exile royalty Prince Bernard of the Netherlands is 300 uh Committee of 300 and here um Prince prin beatus and Prince perti the queen of course of course Prince Phillip all of them high Freemasons mangala Walt Disney all of\n\n(16:04) these individuals the world is really run by these individuals here is the Duke of Kent giving the Masonic handshake under the Masonic Shield he is the current Grand Master so he is the highest Freemason at the moment if you like because a king may not be or a prince may not be The Grandmaster he is\n\n(16:27) currently the the grandm so here is the highest luciferian in the country at the moment political leaders the bill clintons and all of these we've dealt with them uh we don't have to go through all of them again the Jesse Helms the gold Waters the Alors and all of these individuals and I've put the the pages\n\n(16:50) up there and there are many many books that substantiate all of these names so just about every body who is important in the world everybody who runs in the political sphere is involved in these clandestine operations we saw in the lecture on Revelation chapter 17 and 13 how there would be a holy Alliance and\n\n(17:19) how the United States would eventually become the PowerHouse for propagating A New World Order Gorbachev Summit in Malta referred to as the gateway to the Millennium of Freedom as you will remember and the initiative came for this great movement into a new world order now let us have a look at this video where George Bush has something to\n\n(17:47) say on this issue we're institutions of Freedom have lay dormant the United Nations can offer them New Life these institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order an order in which no Nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty an order characterized by the rule of law rather than the resort to\n\n(18:18) force so he says all the nations don't have to give up one iota of their sovereignty but we want them all in a new world order basically that is what he said out of the horse's mouth and then this terrible incident took place and well there were many many deaths a very strange incident but before we get to it let's\n\n(18:51) first have the have a look at some of the history of this issue the United States had a problem in that it wanted to introduce anti-terrorism laws but there was no real terrorism in the United States and then all of a sudden a building in Oklahoma April 19 1995 was gutted by explosions and they fingered a man Timothy McVey who worked\n\n(19:19) alone they said and brought this building down by parking a van filled with explosive outside and blowing the building to smotherin that's the official report inside were women and young children and if anything gets the sympathy of the people well then that is surely one of them let's have a look at\n\n(19:46) what happened here through Federal authorities that a second bomb has been found inside that Federal Building in Oklahoma City it was an explosion at 9:00 this morning that did that damage you're looking at right there that was in the Federal Building did go off it did the damage that you see right there the second explosive was\n\n(20:06) found and diffused the third explosive that was found and they are working on right now as we speak I understand both the second and third explosives if you can imagine this were larger than the first first bomb that was in the Federal Building did go off it did the damage that you see right there so you heard there on National\n\n(20:29) Television that a second bomb went off and it did the damage that you saw over there they found a third explosive device within the side the building the official report however says what that there was a van outside with explosives now I was not there I was not there so I'm not going to set myself up\n\n(20:52) as a judge as to what happened over there I can merely say what the report said what the news said and then we'll ask some questions and you decide what happened over there Timothy McVey apparently worked alone just like in the Kennedy case he blew this place up but eyewitnesses say no they saw two individuals and they saw the truck on a\n\n(21:20) previous day and they had a number but when this building exploded there was no real crater where this truck is supposed to have exploded now if a truck explodes outside the building there must be a crater and the building must implode but the building didn't implode it exploded and that was done by a device on the inside\n\n(21:43) as you heard over here so now to fit the case and to say it was a truck the people said well surely if it was a truck then there must be some parts left of that truck I mean an explosion doesn't just get rid of every piece of a truck it might be in smithin but there should be a piece of an engine block or\n\n(22:04) something like that there was nothing eventually the pressure became so great that a CIA agent jogging four blocks away stumbled over the rare axle of the truck and found it but the problem was how do you identify this rare axle as part of that truck now there had a registration number and fortunately the\n\n(22:31) number was on the rare axle now nowhere in the whole world do you put registration numbers of vehicles on rare axles so this is a strange issue but anyway he was fingered as the sole one but there is so much suspicion surrounding this explosion and then eventually a firm got the contract and they gutted that building before there\n\n(22:55) was any possibility of looking into what happened at that particular event then came another event the Twin Towers now what happened after the first event after the Oklahoma bombing the United States within just 5 days had anti-terrorism legislation and that anti-terrorism legislation gave powers to the president\n\n(23:24) of the United States where he could suspend the con Constitution but it didn't give powers where the United States could unilaterally enter any country in the world to do as it pleased for that it needed a Warf footing legislation as was the case with Pearl Harbor there needed to be an incident well an incident arrived in that the\n\n(23:50) Twin Towers were destroyed President Bush speaks to the United Nations General Assembly November 10 2001 we must speak the truth about Terror let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the Attacks of September the 11th malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists\n\n(24:17) themselves away from the guilty now isn't it interesting that George Bush there said let us not tolerate conspiracy theories that shift the blame away from the terrorists themselves why because so many people started believing that everything was not right with these particular issues now let's have a look at the\n\n(24:43) first hit when this happened the first airplane struck we've been preparing for this kind of event for nearly a decade we've had presidential directives it's a project called Homeland defense we are as we have been saying this morning in a so what we have we have footage of the very first airplane striking that\n\n(25:10) building that means there was an opportunity to record that very quickly the following happened even as the leaders of the Taliban deny any role in this an Arab based an Arab journalist based in London is quoted today to the Associated Press as saying that followers of Osama bin Laden warned three weeks ago they were\n\n(25:37) going to carry out this sort of an attack the chief of safety of the fire department of New York City told me he received word of the possibility of a secondary device that is another bomb going off uh he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could but he said that there was another explosion which took\n\n(25:53) place and according to his theory he thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building 45 minutes into the taping that we were doing there was an explosion it was way up where the fire was and the whole building at that point bellied out in flames and everybody ran I was about\n\n(26:19) five blocks away when that I heard U explosions three thuds and turn around to see the building we just got out of antenna tip over and fall in on itself and then over a sudden it started like like it sounded like gunfire you know bang bang bang bang bang and then and then over sudden three big explosions\n\n(26:38) all right so the eyewitnesses said that they heard secondary devices bang bang bang bang and a series of explosions and then these buildings came down demolition experts said that this is exactly what happens in a controlled demolition you see when an airplane strikes there was a huge Fireball and the fireball is the burning of all the\n\n(27:02) fuel on side on board the a plane so there was nothing left there to explode what was responsible for the secondary explosions if we look at the setup you will see there are the twin towers and there are buildings all around and these buildings were either slightly damaged or not seriously damaged and then there is this a road\n\n(27:33) and there's another building over there called building number seven and that building came down sometime afterwards although nothing hit it and not much was ever said about that what caused building number seven to implode let's watch it okay now watch hours after the first plane crash a third building at\n\n(27:54) the World Trade Center collapses this one the number seven World Trade Center building this is a look at the Flying debris s tower you're going to see that watch the expion toward the camera number seven Tower at the World Trade Center the CIA would have been in there normally but they had of course\n\n(28:12) abandoned the building uh when the uh event of catastrophe occur so who would have been in that building the CIA would have been in that building but they had evacuated the building and 8 hours after words the building comes down in a cont controlled it seems implosion now nothing hit that building and these are very strange strange\n\n(28:39) questions that we have to consider after this event there was a Canadian response and there was a great resolution passed of the United Nation last night that might bring about the New Order in the world that would be better for all of us all of this was brought upon us in a single day and night fell on a different\n\n(29:02) world a world where Freedom itself is under attack so the Canadian response was this could bring about a new order in the world as it was decided at the United Nations after a meeting Gary Hart what did he have to say there is a chance for the president of the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his\n\n(29:29) father a phrase his father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order them your life is going to change but more important your son's life is going to change forever America will never be the same after September 11th we've been preparing for this kind of event for nearly a decade we've had\n\n(29:50) presidential directives it's a project called Homeland defense we are as we have been saying this morning in a state of War even as the leaders of the Taliban deny any role in this an Arab based an Arab journalist based in London is quoted today to the Associated Press as saying that followers of Osama bin\n\n(30:11) Laden warned three weeks ago they were going to carry out this sort of an attack the chief of safety of the fire department of New York City told me he received word of the possibility of a secondary device that is another bomb going off uh he tried to get his Nick but he said that there was another\n\n(30:26) explosion which all right that's enough we've seen the buildings coming down we've heard that while these things were still happening the American government had fingered the culprits a bunch of terrorists M naming their names about 25 of them all together and the whole plot had been resolved by the end of the events that\n\n(30:53) unfolded that day an amazing piece of dete effective work after the event while it was even happening now again let me say I was not there so let me tell you what has transpired and what people have said about these issues in the world what has been published and what is fact that cannot be disputed and\n\n(31:21) then I don't make a judgment because I wasn't there you make the judgment based on the facts this is the story they say the terrorists were of Arab extraction and they mentioned the names of the passengers on these airanes which were United Airline airanes and The Mastermind behind the scene is a man by the name of ATA who is\n\n(31:52) fingered as the one who received instruction on how to fly an airplane well when when they released the names immediately there was a human cry from the Arab countries because five of the terrorists supposed terrorists mentioned that they were very much alive and well and couldn't have been on the plane right very important they were\n\n(32:14) alive and well and couldn't have been on the plane how did they know that ATA was The Mastermind you see on his way to the airport he had just happened to leave his documents in the taxi that was transporting him so they had his documentation which terrorist would leave his documentation behind that is\n\n(32:37) the one question the next point that is very interesting is that they have evidence that he was the man because he wrote a suicide note this is all fact this is all published fact what I'm saying now I'm not making this up this is all referen this is this is a fact you decide the rest for yourself now he\n\n(33:00) wrote a suicide note and this suicide note he then placed within his suitcase and then he handed in the suitcase as we normally do when we go onto the airplane now which person would write a suicide note that was going to be destroyed in an airplane clash does that make any sense so the fact of the matter is they have a suicide note but\n\n(33:26) now the question if he handed in his suitcase to be put on top inside the plane how come they have the suicide note well just by chance this is the one suitcase they forgot to put on the plane and that is how they have his note how do they know there were Arab terrorists in there because a passport nothing else survived that plane crash\n\n(33:51) but a passport fell out and it happened to be a burnt out passport which still could identify one of the terrorists this is very circumstantial now as these airlanes with absolute Precision struck those Twin Towers their black boxes were totally obliterated these are of titanium and are designed to survive such crashes\n\n(34:21) there is no evidence of them whatsoever they have been totally destroyed so we have a very strange situation what H hit building number seven nothing hit it but it came down in like fashion and there is plenty of evidence that uh there were possibly secondary devices in the buildings as you heard from the\n\n(34:45) commentators themselves so what about the infrastructure of the airplanes well there are certain parts lying there so there was definitely a situation where those planes hit that particular building because you have wheels and all kinds of components of the airplanes surviving even those crashes with those tremendous explosions\n\n(35:10) there were parts of these aircrafts everywhere every time an airplane crashes there are huge pieces of fuselage and Etc which remain and they sometimes can fit all these things together and that was also the case at the Twin Towers three days days before those buildings came down 3 days before the shares in the airlines had been sold\n\n(35:36) at a turnover such as had not existed ever before and certain Banks bought these so somebody might have been tipped off that something was going on and then a very interesting case there was a man in your country in Canada who happened to be in prison and they had caught him in a gambling situation and they imprisoned him and he\n\n(36:04) said let me go I am clandestinely working for the CIA I'm an agent I was investigating money laundering etc etc etc and they would not let him go then he gave the names of his contacts at the CIA and the CIA was probably embarrassed because of this situation and denied knowledge of it and he was very angry\n\n(36:28) because he felt he had been stabbed in the back and this very often often happens in this industry and so he wrote a letter before the September 11 attack outlining some events that were going to take place and he mentioned that aircraft were going to fly into the Twin Towers and into the Pentagon now nobody\n\n(36:53) made any use of these but when it actually happened then this came to the fall so here was a CIA agent who said ahead of time that this was going to happen could be chance could not be chance you decide for yourself a certain ATA the man who is supposed to have PL this with only inlight training with\n\n(37:14) absolute Precision they went into those buildings this is an amazing story received funds $100,000 US from Pakistan sec secret societ uh Secret Service into his bank accounts and they work very closely with the United States so here had been a transfer of money but the plot doesn't end there thep is it's them Pentagon facts\n\n(37:44) the evil sits in the Pentagon now who is this man that wrote this this is uh the political scientist Tierre Meson from France and uh he has some very interesting to say who was it what happened over here how come they had all the names of all these people and yet there is no real evidence that these\n\n(38:09) people were actually on board uh here's the story I'm just giving it to you with the passengers machines that flew into these twin towers and then there's this fascinating case of the other airplane that went into the Pentagon and here are the pictures that were published the dates were strangely wrong they were\n\n(38:35) September 12th but apparently they said it's because they released them the next day and what you see is smoke over there there are no debris pots nothing here is a piece missing no picture there you have an impact of a a flame and you have this Fireball over here that's it if you look then on the lawn this is\n\n(39:06) all that was found but no part of a United uh Airlines aircraft no parts nothing nothing whatsoever this is the hole that was seen after the event and most of this hole happened well after the event so the question is why are there no aircraft Parts again all the black boxes disappeared there were no\n\n(39:33) black boxes that survive and the hle is way too small for something like that to actually have happened because nowhere in the world even in the locker be disaster there was a case where there were no aircraft Parts nothing there was just nothing what is even more interested interesting in this situation is when you look at this when\n\n(40:00) the United States rules the world the Catholic Church will rule the world Archbishop Quigley 1903 let me go back to this September 11 to rule the world you have to be able to have access to the entire world whenever you want to however you want to now this airplane that struck the Pentagon and the other one that fell by chance did\n\n(40:24) you know about that the other one that fell and apparently there were terrorists on board that were overcome by loyal citizens the interesting part is that that airplane struck the ground and never struck any building it came down and as it came down there was a hole in the ground and the mayor and the first\n\n(40:48) people of that area ran to the place and here was a hole in the ground but no aircraft debris none none whatsoever not the slightest piece nothing so the whole aircraft disappeared into a hole which was not very large and there was no debris and no black boxes and nothing something like this has never\n\n(41:17) ever happened ever before but what is even more Sinister is the following because the people that had died on the airplane their descendants or their inheritors cannot claim if there is no body but in the investigation they identified every single human body with their blood group and body parts that were given to all the\n\n(41:51) family there were no aircraft Parts there was nothing nothing of that nature found no airplane whatsoever and yet they could identify everybody does that make any sense it doesn't make any sense whatsoever and there were apparently phone calls between the aircraft and the Pentagon such was the information that\n\n(42:19) was released and the information was that there was a terrorist group Arab terrorists that were attacking this place and the phone call was made with a handy with a cell phone but then of course they found out that if you make a phone call with a cell phone then you get an account for that phone call and there was no record\n\n(42:47) of such a phone call so the Pentagon backtracked one and said yes excuse me we didn't actually uh make get the phone call from a cell phone we got it from the onboard telephone that's how it happened and again they didn't investigation if you make a telephone call of an onboard phone then you swipe your credit card\n\n(43:09) through it and there must be a record of a credit card transaction from that phone but there was no record so the Pentagon backtracked again and said yes that is true but it was done as a collect all that's why there was no credit card because the individual had forgotten the credit card but you cannot make a\n\n(43:35) collect call from an onboard telephone and there the story died so here are for aircraft no parts except the ones at the Twin Towers there are holes in the ground and no aircraft whatsoever but all the pieces of the bodies with the DNA analyses these are interesting very interesting facts they had planned previously in the\n\n(44:08) Bay of Pigs one such operation apparently this is history where they were going to dup the World by having one aircraft take off land the people get out and then another one radio control take off and create the situation that they wanted without any people on board this had been done before in the United\n\n(44:32) States so ask yourself the following questions how is it possible that all this circumstantial evidence points to nobody out there nobody out there then came anthra scares and when eventually someone high up in politics suggested that uh it seems to come from a laboratory Within then suddenly there was absolute silence so let us not\n\n(45:00) continue with the September 11 and ask and say it was this or that party the fact of the matter is this is a very strange situation and if you look at the high role players in the United States whether it's Marilyn orright or any one of them they use broaches which depict luciferian connections like goats and\n\n(45:24) all of these President Clinton here is receiving the host publicly and he claims not to be a Roman Catholic that is impossible Hillary Clinton is wearing the fix Rising which is a Masonic symbol uh Sher Blair uses Masonic signals the presidents the prime ministers of the world whether the thatchers or the Carters or the whoever\n\n(45:54) they are all of them seem to belong to Insider organizations whether they are religious leaders or political leaders or whether they are Europeans or Americans or Eastern all of them seem to be involved if we look at Africa and Rome this will give us an idea of what the New World Order is going to be all about Africa\n\n(46:24) and what they' have done to Africa serves as a model for what will happen in the entire world the great African leaders and the the tyrants of the past like the ID Amin these people have all received Exile and were probably high masonics when we look at the southern Africa South Africa situation where you\n\n(46:44) had the black white issue the aparte issue the role players again were all Masons this is Foster the president and he gives a masonic signal and he was a Freemason if we look at Nelson Mandela he is a Prince Hall Freemason so again both sides are on the same side of a secret society if we look at um de clar and Nelson Mandela\n\n(47:16) we have the same situation there Mandela is compared to Jesus Christ they lift him up they have a synthesis and an antithesis and he receives the host publicly although he declines to say that he is Roman Catholic he says he's not Roman Catholic now Roman Catholic canon law states that you cannot receive\n\n(47:37) the host if you are not a Roman Catholic so these people are really something else here he has a Hindu uh marriage with the Widow of Samora Melle now Samora Melle is another story and uh he's anti Christian statements are historic he also had a uh Jewish wedding at the same ceremony and a Muslim showing that all religions are one with\n\n(48:11) him the new political face is totally Masonic and in 1992 already it was known that mugabi of Zimbabwe was going to take the Farms away from the people that lived there this is before he started doing this they had already said it mugabi is going to take white Farms very soon it was in 1992 today this is a fact the Pagel\n\n(48:41) published the miss the Germans must get out all whites must get out here's a cartoon of Kissinger pointing to the fact that the whites Must Get Out of Africa here is the current president of of South Africa mcki and mugabi they are hand inand on this issue he refuses to rebuke mugabi for taking the Farms by\n\n(49:09) force in South Africa itself 4,000 farmers at least have died and have been killed as they have been driven off their land nobody hears about these things in the world Zimbabwe lies in Ruins but what we find here a tremendous building going up and what is it called the Jesuit province of Zimbabwe so the\n\n(49:33) Jesuits are totally in control in that country Jesuit school of philosophy and the humanities brand new buildings while a country lies in Ruins they're preparing for a final order and all the black leaders are in the same level as all the European and American leaders they all belong to the the same club now what is this new world\n\n(49:58) order here is the new South African coat of arms where you can see the phix rising out of the ashes the crown of Mitra with a with a seven Rays all the symbolism points to the same thing I'm going to run you through the new economic order of the New World Order and these are now quotes from Roman Catholic sources themselves and I would\n\n(50:25) like to tell you that you haven't experienced anything yet waiting to come to you and I can tell you what it feels like because I have experienced it if you've ever want to read an interesting book read ecclesiastical megalomania but I'll be quoting from encyclicals and all these things according to canon law the\n\n(50:47) control of all property of the Roman Church State belongs to the pope its Supreme Emperor everything I say will have a quote now everything is substantiated by either a Papal encyclical or any one of these now communism took all property away and made it the state's property capitalism says the property belongs to the\n\n(51:12) individual and nobody has the right to take it away now if that is thesis and anti-thesis then something in between is what we will want so the Pope condemned communism but he also condemns capitalism the New World Order will be something in between in the name of fairness so let us have a look at these\n\n(51:36) issues the economic thought of the Roman Catholic Church private property Thomas ainus wrote no Treatise on economics but his thinking based on that of the of Aristotle is foundational for understanding the economic thought of the Roman Catholic church every time there is a quote now what did Thomas\n\n(51:53) ainus say Roman Catholic economic thought is developed as developed by the popes in their encyclicals and by the Roman Church state councils has been a contributor to one feudalism guilt socialism in Europe during the Middle Ages fascism in Italy Spain Portugal Nazism in Germany in the 20th century interventionism and redistributive state\n\n(52:17) in the west including the United States in the 20th century and Liberation theology in Latin America and Africa in the 20th century what does this mean Thomas a said the possession of all things in common is natural law Thomas wrote the position of all things in common and use of universal Freedom are said to be of the\n\n(52:38) natural law because to with the distinction of positions and slavery were not brought in by nature but devised by human reason for the benefit of human life now what does all that mean it simply means property is for common good you may own it but it is for Comm common good the community of goods wrote Thomas is ascribed to natural law\n\n(53:01) not that the natural law dictates that all things should be possessed in common and that nothing should be possessed as one own as one's own so you may possess things yes but because the division of possessions is not according to natural law but rather arose from Human agreement which belongs to positive law\n\n(53:16) they talk such Dil it's interesting never like hence the ownership of possessions is not contrary to natural law but an addition theto devised by human reason let's continue Thomas wrote hence whatever certain people have in superabundance is due by natural law to the purpose of suckering the poor okay\n\n(53:36) now we're getting there you may possess things whatever you possess but whatever you possess more than you need is there for the common good of those that don't have does that make sense now what if you create two classes of individuals the rich and the poor or what if there is a situation where you have two\n\n(54:00) classes the rich and the poor you can go across the world and you can look at the rich Nations and the poor Nations and you will find that the rich nations are all the Protestant Nations have you noticed that all the Protestant nations are the rich now what if you had a plan to disinherit them all so that you would again be ruler and\n\n(54:21) they would have to come and beg at your feet for anything like that now let's have a look at this how this uh unfolds for the purpose of suckering the four because the goods of some are due to others by natural law there is no sin if the poor take the goods of their neighbors Thomas wrote in cases of need\n\n(54:47) all things are common property so that there would seem to be no sin in taking another's properties for the need has made it common okay now there's the aspect of sharing if I see my neighbor in trouble as a good Christian I will help him out right yes but now we're looking at law so if my neighbor has need and who determines\n\n(55:10) the need he he determines the need I have need I have a need I have a need of a television and I don't have one and you have one and you have money and you can go and buy yourself another one I have need of your television can you then take it without being a sinner yes or no according to this yes what if you have a\n\n(55:29) car and he doesn't have one he can take it without sin according to Thomas ainus now this was a long time ago Sur this doesn't apply today well we'll see not only is such taking of another's property not a sin it is not even a crime according to Thomas it is lawful for a man to sucker his own need by means of another's property by taking\n\n(55:51) it either openly or secretly nor is this properly speaking theft and robbery it is not theft properly speaking to take secretly and use another's property in a case of extreme need because that which he takes for the support of his life becomes his own property by reason of that need in a case of a like need a man\n\n(56:11) may also take secretly another's property in order to sucker his neighbor in need oh this gets very interesting now did you know that if I leave my property unattended in South Africa and somebody moves in I cannot throw him out he's in because he has need that's the law and you think that is a South African law no that is a\n\n(56:39) British law as well that is a law virtually all over the country now but it's not being implemented because the situation is not such yet that it has to be implemented everywhere once you start opening the borders and millions of poor people start coming in well then there will be great need what did they do with need\n\n(57:01) overseas so in South Africa people go on holiday they come back their house is occupied and they can't throw the P people out because their property is in their name they have to pay the bills they have to pay the rates they have to pay all those things but need made it common therefore that man can move in is\n\n(57:21) that the situation yes it is gets worse the Roman Catholic doctrine of private property is echoed in the 19th century communist slogan from each according to his ability to each according to his need can you see the Roman Catholic Doctrine there human rights are more important than property rights it was\n\n(57:39) the Creed of Linton Johnson's Great Society we shall take from the halves and give to the Have Nots who need it so much ly Johnson said that what continent is that it appears in the literature of fascism Nazism Liberation theology interventionism and socialism the universal destination of goods this is John Paul 2's expression\n\n(58:06) of it in 1987 in an encyclical site called on social concern it is necessary to State once more the characteristic principle of Christian social Doctrine the goods of this world are originally meant for all the right of private property is valid necessary but it does not nullify the value of this principle\n\n(58:28) private property in fact is under a social Mortage which means that it has an intrinsically social function based upon the Justified precisely by the principle of universal destination of goods oops what did John Paul to just say he said that which Thomas said is what I say you may have private property\n\n(58:48) the Roman Catholic Church is for private property that sounds very nice but it's never qualified that that property is only yours for common good so one day you wake up and in your garden you have squatters and you call the police and you say Hey or you go out and you say get off my property and they say let me\n\n(59:13) alone or I'll blow your head off hey you go to the cops you say cops come help here people squatting on my land sorry they have need you have too much land anyway live with it okay Pope Paul I 6 made the point quite clear in 1967 in cyclical on the progress of people each man has therefore the right to find in the world\n\n(59:38) what is necessary for himself this gets interesting the recent Council Vatican 2 reminded us of this God intended the Earth and all that it contains for the use of every human being and people thus as all men follow Justice and unite in charity created Goods create ated Goods should abound for them on a reasonable\n\n(59:57) basis all other rights whatsoever including those of property and of free Commerce are to be subordinate to this principle that means if I have need of a manufactured good can I take it so now I'm driving my car and we have a hijacking just about every 12 minutes and a gun comes in and says get out of the car and I relinquish my car\n\n(1:00:24) and if I don't what happens to me I get shot the man has need of my car it's gone finished in my own church at home we've had hijackings after hijackings even the pastor they beit him up and tried to put him into the trunk of the car they would have killed him he managed to fight himself free and off he\n\n(1:00:49) went without his car do you think there's any big action to find these things no occasionally here and occasionally there do you think there's any big action when the farmers are killed and they move onto the lands no a little bit here and a little bit there just to keep people happy but basically nothing is done and the police\n\n(1:01:09) hands are cut off the law says that there's nothing you can do the other day two cyclists were traveling along when they were hijacked by five gunmen demanding their bikes so they took out they were armed because they expect this is becoming like the wild west and they defended themselves injured one and got away and guess what\n\n(1:01:36) the two cyclists are in jail yes serving a sentence for injuring someone without need they could have given them the bicycles that would have solved the problem you see how the law has turned upside down gandum esess the Vatican 2 Constitution Pope Paul quoted explains at greater length if one is in extreme\n\n(1:02:01) necessity he has the right to procure for himself what he needs out of the riches of others now who defines necessity since there are so many people prostrate with hunger in the world the sacred Council urges all both individuals and governments to remember the aforism of the fathers feed the man dying of hunger because if you have not\n\n(1:02:21) fed him you have killed him therefore because private property is immoral all men individuals and governments have the moral obligation to redistribute Goods held unjustly by property owners have you heard of redistribution of goods lately have you heard of it many times lately yes there is going to be a\n\n(1:02:43) redistribution all Goods includes Not Just Goods found in nature but manufacturers Goods as well John Paul 2 declared that all men must have access to those goods quote which are intended for common use both the goods of Nature and manufactured goods I own nothing only on paper do I own every anything the state rules\n\n(1:03:07) Supreme my life soon could be a misery so if you are attached to your homes here in Canada and this is the basis for the new world order if you are attached to your cars and your televisions and all these things loosen yourself you because soon they will be redistributed and there will be nothing that the white or black or pink\n\n(1:03:32) Protestant can do about it and if some other suffers in the way that is fair enough then justifies the means the redistribution will go as it should be noar who's heard of rarum this is the papal encyclical that was issued that is being quoted to this day Pope John's and uh to this day all of them make reference to\n\n(1:04:00) this including Pope John Paul to says this is this encyclical that forms the basis of the New World Order well I thought it's important to study it one of the Roman chur Church State's most influential statements on economic matters is the encyclical r noar on the condition of the working classes the r\n\n(1:04:22) Roman Church State alloted herself with a arat which in Marxism is the great and final enemy of the capitalist order Pi writing declared that R novarum however stood out in this that it laid down For All Mankind uniring rules for the right solution of difficult problems of human solidarity called the social\n\n(1:04:43) question now let's see by far the most notable evidence of this social teaching and action which the church has set forth through the centuries undoubtedly is the encyclical rum narum issued 70 years ago the norms and recommendations contained there in were so momentous that their memory will never fall into\n\n(1:05:03) Oblivion John M magistra the papacy speaking popas told us that the encyclical rarum was instrumental in ending leere capitalism in the 20th century by ushering in an era of effective interference by the government have you got this let's see how it ends up rum narum was the voice of moral Authority needed to ensure the\n\n(1:05:29) development of effective interference by all governments in the 20th century how many governments all P wrote it is not surprising therefore that under the teaching and guidance of the church many learned priests and Layman earnestly devoted themselves to problems of elaborating Social and economic science\n\n(1:05:48) in according with the condition of our age under the guidance and light of Leo and cyclical rum narum was thus involved a truly Christian social science which continues to be fostered and enriched daily tireless labors all these people labors now note carefully of those picked men whom we have named the\n\n(1:06:13) auxiliaries of the church so everybody working in the secret societies the Opus D the this the mites of Malta the Knights of Columbus all of these people work those picked men to bring this about nor were there the only blessings which followed from the encyclical the doctrine of narum rarum began little by\n\n(1:06:33) little to penetrate amongst those who being outside Catholic Unity do not recognize the authority of the church and these Catholic principles of social sociology gradually became the part of the intellectual Heritage of the whole human race where are we going I'd like to know thus too we Rejoice that the Catholic\n\n(1:06:56) truths proclaimed so vigorously by our illustrious predecessor are Advanced and advocated not merely in non-catholic books and journals but frequently in legislative assemblies and in courts of Justice those picked men whom we have named the auxiliaries of the church who have been instrumental this is John\n\n(1:07:17) Robbins writing who are they under fascism Property Owners may keep their property titles and deeds but use of their property is as Leo wrote Common fascism is a form of Socialism that retains the forms and trappings of capitalism but not its substance this is basically what it boils down to when we\n\n(1:07:40) speak of Reform of Institutions the state becomes chiefly to mind not as if Universal well-being were to be expected from its activities and what is the state going to do in all of this they the experiment with economic freedom Pas wrote must end and economic life must again be subjected to planning and\n\n(1:08:02) government who wants to control your economic life government John Paul 2 wrote in his solicitud re socialis on social concern it is necessary to State once more the characteristic principle of Christian social Doctrine the goods of this world are meant for all private prop is under social morage these are the things which will\n\n(1:08:29) be controlled he wrote a faithful echo of the centuries old tradition of the church regarding the universal purpose of good in today's world wrote the pope we are faced with a serious problem of unequal distribution of the means of subsistence originally meant for everybody then came Liberation theology\n\n(1:08:52) and Pius wrote an encyclical on atheistic communism an age like ours where unusual misery has resulted who created the misery they created it so that they can create the solution which they want so in Africa they elevate a few and suppress the masses then they turn it around and they create the situation\n\n(1:09:19) that they want they create communism they create the chaos out of the chaos they create the so social order which they want so the second reign of terror was supported by the papacy father Camilo terus who was shot in 1966 declared the Catholic who is not a revolutionary is living in mortal sin Pope John Paul 2 wrote in 1968 the\n\n(1:09:42) church does not hesitate to defend fearlessly the just and Noble cause of Human Rights and to support courageous reforms leading to a better distribution of goods including Earthly Goods such as Education Health Service housing and so forth now we come to Human Rights what did we read about in the French\n\n(1:10:02) Revolution what's going to be the standard of the world human rights you have a right to property you have a right to anything that you have need of we are convinced that the Theology of Liberation is not only timely but useful and necessary that's what the Pope says not me this is his word directly John Paul 2 letter to Brazilian\n\n(1:10:27) Bishops it should constitute a new stage of the theological reflection initiated within the apostolic uh tradition and then he refers to Rum noar Franklin ruselt when he was elected he made Professor Ryan part of his administration now who was he Ryan wrote in 1931 the workers have a claim upon industry for all the means of living\n\n(1:10:53) from from the time they begin to work until they die when industry does not do it directly then it is the business of government to enforce it upon industry see how it starts right now let's look at some of the human rights you have a right to freely found unions for working people you have a right to culture a right to\n\n(1:11:13) immigrate a right to immigrate a right to food a right to clothing a right to rest a right to Medical Care a right to just wage a right to life a right to safe environment a right to personal security of workers a right to Family Life a right to private property highly qualified of course a right to common\n\n(1:11:29) use of all Goods is just their after so that means nothing a right to work a right to pension a right to old age Insurance a right to Association a right to security a right to Integrity a right to Social Services a right to strike a right to choose a state of Life freely a right to found a family a right to\n\n(1:11:48) education employment good reputation respect appropriate information a right with the upright blah blah blah protection of privacy right to rightful Freedom professional training quality right to adequate healthare oh it's laborious how do you control that how do you control it if you're going to control every\n\n(1:12:10) aspect of that then you must control every aspect of a person's life you will not be able to go to the toilet in future without making a triple application to the Vatican they're going to control every single aspect of your lives that's what they're going to control and government is going to become super\n\n(1:12:38) huge Now where's the money going to come from from you now when the money comes from you what then happens to your wealth again gets less and less and less and less that means the middle class will disappear how many classes under Catholicism in the Middle Ages two there was a feudal class the goam and there\n\n(1:13:09) was the upper class who controlled everything now if we take employment in my country employment was running at almost 50% in Germany it was running at something % and then it went up to 2 3 5 10 20% now unemployment is Rife in Europe why because all the East block countries are now being incorporated into Europe\n\n(1:13:37) and there must be redistribution of wealth and so it's coming down down down down down the recent surveys don't ask where you live they say how many rooms have you got how many people live there how many this how many that when did they do that and in what country in communism and what happened if your house was bigger than your need\n\n(1:14:04) the one who had the need got it but who has to pay for it you because you own it it's even worse now than in communism right so they came to our country now you have to register in each individual location and you may not vote outside your location so that they have your location attached to your name and then they came\n\n(1:14:26) to my house and they said they want to know what is my religion I said I'm a Christian they said which denomination are you I said it's none of your business they say it is my business which denomination are you I said it's none of your business how many rooms have you got I said enough we want to know exactly how many rooms you have I\n\n(1:14:45) said I have enough but we want to know exactly it's got nothing to do with you why do you want to know exactly I could have another one next week or I could put a wall in I could have to right it's none of your business you get into big trouble if you answer questions like that you're not supposed to do that\n\n(1:15:01) therefore there must be made available to all men everything necessary for leading a life truly human did you know that living a life truly human is the Catholic acronym for salvation and I will prove this to you in a future lecture where they say to be saved means to live a life truly human that means the kingdom of God for\n\n(1:15:33) Catholicism is the kingdom of Catholicism ruling the world on this Earth and giving everyone the capacity to live a life truly human that means enough to take care of your basic needs and nothing else do you like the new world order do do you like it you know what they the Bible calls him the man of\n\n(1:15:58) sin now there's another word for the redistribution of wealth and I've given it to you already what is it it's called theft that's right the Bible says Thou shalt not steal that means Thou shalt not take from one who has and give it to someone else that's called theft that's breaking the Commandments of God is that\n\n(1:16:22) correct yes we will see that this system of Human Rights breaks every single commandment of God as we go along when God distributed land to Israel how was it distributed as an eternal inheritance it was your land Ahab wanted nebo's Vineyard and nebot said to him I will not sin against the Lord my God because\n\n(1:16:53) because this land has been given to me as an eternal inheritance and to my children God gives each one a piece that is his they take it and distribute it according to need but you pay the bill fascinating the complex circumstance of our day makes it necessary for Public Authority to intervene more often in\n\n(1:17:19) social economic and cultural matters the second Vatican Council that's what it said so they're going to intervene at every level of your life l f goach for imps goach praises the pope and he says the pope is right in his demand for a new world order in 19991 the San Francisco Chronicle already said Pope calls for a new world\n\n(1:17:48) order Albert Einstein says Mankind's desire desire for peace can be realized only by the creation of a world government with all my heart I believe that the world's present system of sovereign Nations can only lead to barbarism war and inhumanity and that only law can assure progress towards a civilized peaceful\n\n(1:18:12) Humanity interesting statement Albert Einstein what it uh he also stated he says there is no salvation for civilization or even the human race other than to creation of a world government that was Albert Einstein what did you tant former Secretary General of the United Nations say he said World Federalists hold\n\n(1:18:37) before us the vision of a unified mankind living in peace under a just world order the heart of their program a world under law is realistic and attainable what did n Elder say world peace is impossible without World Government Winston Churchill these are Big names I'm not not talking about small fry the creation\n\n(1:19:02) of an authoritative World Order is the ultimate aim towards which we must strive Charles the goal Nations must unite in a world government or perish how do you do that how about creating so much conflict that everybody will be willing to give up their sovereignty do you know what in South Africa I give these\n\n(1:19:32) lectures to the public the people are in despair they are being robbed driven off their land they're being murdered our houses look like prisons we cannot go to sleep without locking everything in my very own little block we've had murder after murder after murder and robberies aggravating robberies and nothing seems to happen\n\n(1:20:02) police don't even care they don't even come out because there is so much turmoil all over the place that it cannot they cannot even cope with it so who cares about your little problem that you've just lost everything take it to the insurance and see if you can get it back irrespective of the pain they come\n\n(1:20:23) in they move in they take all your private papers they burn them you have no record of your life everything's gone they sell the furniture they don't want and the rest they keep for your themselves and say get lost it's now time for redistribution you had land before now it's my land that's how it goes this is the New World Order Welcome\n\n(1:20:46) to the New World Order Bertrand Russell the only possibilities are now world government or death the humanist Manifesto too urges us to move towards the building of a world Community Robert Miller former assistant Secretary General of the United Nations said we must move as quickly as possible to a One World\n\n(1:21:08) Government a one world religion under a one world leader I wonder who that is going to be these are big big names that I'm putting on the screen these on spec speculators here and there I'm often accused for speculating well the biggest speculators are these people themselves and what about this man we saw how peace and unity was to\n\n(1:21:37) come about it was great a great feeling of excitement of Peace of love peace love and unity un Unity yes Nations will come and worship before you oh Lord L and worship before you all the and all the world in bir in every Pope calls for a new world order CNN Thursday January 1 2004 he made his whole New Year Speech\n\n(1:23:03) revolve around the New World Order I want to tell you today that the New World Order is intended not just to unite the Nations which God had separated that's one aspect but to eradicate Protestant ISM of the face of the Earth and particularly that form of protestantism which refuses to bow to the papal\n\n(1:23:35) Caesar that form of protestantism will have to go and we will see that under the circumstances that will be created these conditions are all in place right now it is all the there and I will put it on the screen for you so don't miss the next lectures now we're getting into hot territory I'll put the quotes on the\n\n(1:24:03) screen where they will tell you who the problem children are going to be and don't think it's Islam it's someone else don't miss the next exciting episodes but before I go I would like to remind you that Jesus said that this was going to happen and if I know and if I understand with my whole mind and with my whole heart that Satan\n\n(1:24:31) because the dragon gave him his power and great Authority is setting up his kingdom here upon this Earth then instead of becoming disillusioned frightened hysterical I know that the time must be very short isn't that right and I know that the Lord must be coming very soon so as far as I'm concerned I have\n\n(1:24:55) distanced myself from my property if I literally had to come home next week and find my wife somewhere in another little room and my house occupied by whomever then I will say tough cheese it's going to blow up anyway who cares it's going to be destroyed when the Lord comes by the brightness of his coming why not\n\n(1:25:21) take it now have fun while you can and I'll move on somewhere else I don't mind building a treehouse for a little while that should be okay if they take my cars well that's okay too we'll get another one and if we can't afford another one we'll we'll walk who cares I really don't care anymore but people who are\n\n(1:25:40) losing Things become desperate and what do they do they commit suicide by the thousands people are committing suicide if they understand this message and they understand where we are going would they then commit suicide no they gather hope they say wow so we're part of a big excite exciting end game and this is\n\n(1:26:05) exactly what is happening people are getting hope and they're giving their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ and they are saying Lord Save Me Not only from my sin but save me from this world I am longing for your kingdom do you know what the government policy is in the kingdom of God I've already told you\n\n(1:26:27) everyone in the kingdom of God gets a Dwelling Place in the City built by whom by God and it has your name on it did you know that you have a city dwelling in the new world what happens God says no longer will they build houses and others live in them so what are you going to do they will build houses says the Bible\n\n(1:26:55) and they will plant Vineyards and no longer will you plant vine Vineyards and others eat of them what does that mean that means you will have a country dwelling where you will have a farm which God will bless and who does it belong to to you for how long forever forever and ever and ever and ever that's God's policy so who\n\n(1:27:22) cares about what they're going to do who cares an ey has not seen nor ear has heard the Wonders that God has prepared for them that love him that does not just include the glory of seeing our King in heaven it includes everything that goes into making life Pleasant and the new kingdom is worthy of waiting for really I look forward to\n\n(1:27:52) the New Kingdom of God it'll be a great place and we will unfortunately see this world go from bad to worse and I don't want to lie to you and say it's going to get better I'm going to tell you it's going to get worse very much worse what happened in the French Revolution is the Forerunner of what will happen in the\n\n(1:28:14) entire world there will be Anarchy like you cannot believe but if you are under the protection of the most high I nothing will happen to you so why not accept him why not say Lord Jesus I want you to be my personal savior amen why not say Lord clean up my life let's walk together because your government is the only one worth having\n\n(1:28:43) and imagine looking in his face and saying wow this is my god I've waited for him he will save me Heroes of Flight 93 the official version is that this plane was heading let's say example for the White House or for the capital building but that uh some Heroes on board overpowered the pilot and then the plane\n\n(1:29:13) crashed onto the ground killing all the occupants very fascinating stuff by the way of all the four airplanes involved no black box has been found no black box they are designed to withstand such crashes there is not one that has res has remained now at Shanksville what happened here now this we don't have in\n\n(1:29:36) English it's in German so subtitles have been put underneath and you can read it in English as you go along and we can see what happened here the people come and they now interview the mayor of Shanksville who was one of the first at the scene as to what actually was present when they arrived and you will\n\n(1:29:56) find something very interesting well yeah my brother-in standing in shville the corner of the street right there were and there's no airplane here no where P looks like this is it airplane debris nothing I could identify this is what we saw that's an interesting story so here you have an interview with\n\n(1:32:08) the eyewitnesses that come to the crash site and there's no airplane but there's a hole in the ground and in the hole nothing no airplane no airplane debris nothing just a hole in the ground in which a whole Boe disappeared totally dissolving itself with nothing to show interestingly they have the bodies of\n\n(1:32:31) every single one that was on board but there's no airplane now that is weird you must admit that's kind of weird and that is the picture of the the actual Cloud that formed this photographer just happened to be there when it happened and that is the cloud that forms when a bomb hits like they used in\n\n(1:32:56) Afghanistan and the question was asked was it perhaps a bomb and not an airplane at all and where is the airplane we wouldn't know it's gone now nowhere in the history of the world has an airplane like that just disappeared I mean imagine when your shuttle exploded up there what a terrible disaster that\n\n(1:33:14) was and there was like a nuclear explosion in midair they could almost reconstruct that shuttle from all the debris that they put together isn't that correct and here nothing nothing no airplane it's gone no airplan very interesting let's go and look at what happened at the Pentagon amongst reports circulating is\n\n(1:33:40) the report that there was an explosion in the Pentagon now according to this an airplane flew into the Pentagon let's have a look what was aired on National Television Vision abroad question off well there you have it that's the second one here comes an airplane crashes into the Pentagon goes through a hole leaves\n\n(1:35:14) a hole 1.8 m wide a whole airplane leaves a hole 1.8 m wide the rest of it collapsed later inside the building no airplane debris it's completely dissolved gone but there are clocks and there are telephones and furniture they seem to have survived nothing else no engine block no nothing survived no airplane whereas if you go to the World\n\n(1:35:47) Trade Center where everybody saw the airplanes fly in what do you find there this is a situation TR there were no problem there that was a massive explosion if anything should have ripped those planes apart it should have been there but there's lots of debris of airplanes but at the Pentagon nothing\n\n(1:36:16) not a thing at Shanksville nothing no airplane dissolved completely the fact of the matter is that immediately after these events the power was granted to act internationally and you had massive legislation Homeland response all of these things came in now I'm not saying who it was I'm not saying what\n\n(1:36:43) transpired I'm just giving you the facts as they were and you decide whether the official version is okay oh oh oh oh",
  "Title: \n 222_the_mystic_realm_of_death_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt Key Topics: \n Biblical Death Doctrine,Soul and Spirit,Veneration of Dead,Paganism vs. Christianity,Resurrection and Judgment Guide: \n This source meticulously dissects the biblical concept of death, contrasting it with widespread pagan and spiritualist beliefs. It emphasizes that a \"living soul\" is the combination of dust (body) and the breath of life (metabolism), and upon death, this entity ceases to existâ€”it does not become an immortal spirit. The text highlights a fundamental difference between God's teaching of death as a sleep awaiting resurrection for believers, versus the devil's lie that humans do not truly die but continue as conscious spirits (a belief often found in various world religions and spiritualism). The source further argues that the veneration and consultation of the dead, prevalent in many religious systems including some Christian traditions and ancient pagan cults like Osiris worship, are explicitly forbidden in scripture and are actually demonic deceptions. Finally, it clarifies that \"hell\" in the biblical sense refers to the grave or a destructive, consuming fire whose consequence is eternal, not eternal suffering. Content: \n (2) 222 - The Mystic Realm of Death - Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - YouTube\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lb4gPbrzd2Q&amp;list=PLWiIsOV3p3xJQKdnD3_gZlf7_q9FdYHHL&amp;index=22\n \n (00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] the Mystic realm of death and the Lord God formed of the Dust of the ground and formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostril the breath of life and man received a living Soul Genesis 2:7 is that what it says there nope doesn't say that it says and man\n (01:31) became a living Soul so in other words if we look at this text we have two components there was dust of the ground that's the matter the material substance which by itself has no life and then he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life he gave him life he gave him that's something which made the\n (02:04) non-living living and he calls it then a living Soul so in other words the combination of dust of the earth plus the Breath of Life is equal to a living Soul that's the formula for life now this Breath of Life Is this a living entity by itself is this something that exists in another world floats around and is a living\n (02:38) thinking intelligent entity or is it merely the ruach the fire the metabolism that something which makes something alive that's a very important question now the Bible says you don't receive a living Soul when this combination takes place you become a living Soul so breath breath Spirit breath of man\n (03:12) Spirit of man so the word breath is often interchangeably used with the word Spirit Ru spirit so this breath is something which makes it alive now breath if you think about it in scientific terms is oxygen exchange and oxygen Exchange in The Sciences we call metabolism so a living cell differs from a non-living in that it has\n (03:47) metabolism there is something happening chemically in there that nobody can duplicate once that metabolism spark is gone no scientist can create life he can put all the substance together but he cannot produce life so that breath that metabolism spark is something that comes from God every breathing thing that's\n (04:13) exactly what it means and the word Spirit there strongs 07307 Ru Spirit Wind breath mind blast air anger cool courage that which makes you alive this metabolism this Ru this spirit this breath this wind so is it a living entity this wind or does the individual when he is combined with the dust and this Ru does he become the\n (04:49) living entity well the formula said he becomes a living soul nephesh soul life person mind creature the body himself yourself you become you that's what it means there are the definitions strike out of the Hebrew concordance so when you are alive then you are a living nephesh you are nephesh you are a\n (05:24) living Soul you are the entity you are not two entities you are one entity and the Lord commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou must freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die Genesis 2:16-17 that's what the Bible\n (05:52) actually says but the devil says something else the devil's lie you shall not surely die Genesis 3:4 so God says you will surely what die and die means not live right or wrong right but the devil says no no no no no you will not surely die which actually means that you will live Romans 6:23 says the wages of sin is death\n (06:29) death for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like God even better so the dev devil promises that when you die or when you eat of the fruit you will not die you will have eternal life and you will become bigger and better and greater and like God so that's really something and a lot of\n (06:55) religions believe exactly that if you take Hinduism then you do not die you just continue in the spirit world and you return again and you get better and better and better and you wipe out the karma of your past and eventually you reach a state of godhood and you become a living God and you can be worshiped on this Earth they\n (07:17) worship them all the time isn't that so so the devil said something and today the whole world believes the LIE rather believing what God says you are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie\n (07:46) he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it John 8:44 well the Bible doesn't men's words as to which one spoke the truth there in Eden God said you will die that means if life living entity consisted of the Dust of the earth and the spirit the ruach the breath the life spark the metabolic process God takes it back then\n (08:16) you cease to exist you die you just dust the devil says uh uh uh uh you will continue to live you will never die in fact you will be like God I am the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob God is not the god of the dead but of the living Matthew 2232 let's read another one Mark 12:27 he is not the god of the dead but\n (08:48) the god of the living ye therefore do greatly ear for he's not the god of the Dead Luke 20:38 but of the living for all live unto him now this is fascinating so God says that he is the god of the living now he mentions even some names over here Abraham and Isaac and Jacob are they living or are they\n (09:20) dead now they're dead they've died but God regards them as living does that mean that they live as Spirit entities now or does it mean that in Christ they are alive in Christ there is eternal life for them but the question arises when is that life going to be given them and the answer that the Bible consistently gives\n (09:54) is in the Resurrection The Bible teaches death death but if you are in Christ Resurrection to eternal life the other systems teach when you die you have it instantly and you continue as a spirit and you live eternally as a spirit but then there some teach that when you are resurrected the spirit has to come back\n (10:25) into the body so as he come down he has to rise again as a body so how will they live in future as a body again in the meantime they live as a spirit but they never die it's not consistent with the Biblical teaching but the bottom line is that God does not count those that have died in Christ as dead he counts them as\n (10:50) living because in him they have life now Osiris the god of the Dead Osiris was worshiped not as the god of the living but the god of the Dead in fact the greatest thing that could happen to you was to die because when you were dead you were with Osiris and Osiris was the one who gave you Eternal Bliss so Osiris was the god\n (11:23) of the dead as opposed to Jesus Christ who is the god of the living tat Moses III is attributed with the guide book of The Nether world the umat and he is the one who wrote the system on which the Gnostic faith is is based the whole Osiris cult that we looked at last night to some extent is based on the god of the dead so you had\n (11:50) two gods in ancient times yve the god of the living Christ Jesus yve the Savior that's what what that means is the one who is the god of the living and you can only have life in Christ because in Christ and no one else there is life but Osiris was the god of the dead so the god of the Dead was actually a God that\n (12:22) concentrated on death rather than on life and veneration of the Dead was A system that is tributed to Osiris so in this religious system you had the various deities and Osiris was the one who weighed you in the balances to see if you were found wanting so he is also the one who is the judge now in the biblical system who is the one who\n (12:52) is the judge all judgment has given unto whom was given unto Jesus Jesus is the judge he's the god of the living so Jesus says if you are in me you have nothing to fear I am the judge I'm The Advocate I'm everything rolled into one Osiris is the one who weighs your works and sees whether your Works your\n (13:15) good works outweigh your bad works and if your good works outweigh your bad works well then you went to the good place and if your bad Works outweighed your good works then you went to the bad place place so the teaching of a bad place on the other side and a good place on the other side is based on the Osiris\n (13:39) cult and we have to compare the two very very carefully so it was taught that Anubis for example this doglike God is another form of Osiris the god of the dead and when you died he is the one who took you through the processes that occurred on the other side so the Pharaoh when he died his whole clan was put to death his\n (14:10) whole staff had to die with him and they probably died quite happily because they were going through to the other side to serve in a much more exalted capacity than they served before so they did have no fear we have religions today where people are prepared to do all kinds of things to get into that state of\n (14:34) bliss even blow themselves up just to get to that state of bliss they have no knowledge of the teachings of the scriptures in this regard well they would never do such a silly thing so after death it was taught that life continues much as it does today without the burdens and uh you carry it on in in a blissful Cloud n situation\n (15:03) now the veneration and the consultation of the Dead is prohibited in the scriptures Deuteronomy 18:10 to12 says there shall not be found amongst you anyone that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire all that uses divination or the Observer of times or an enchanter or a witch or a charma\n (15:25) or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer someone who consults the dead for all that do these things are an Abomination unto the Lord and because of these Abominations the Lord thy God does drive them out from before thee Deuteronomy 18:10 to12 so when you call upon the names of these deceased you are\n (15:54) calling up this not the spirits of the Dead you are calling up the spirits of demons and they have no problem in impersonating those that went before anyone who came into contact with a dead person or a grave was considered unclean and could not take part in the temple worship now that does not mean\n (16:18) that if someone died in the family you could not bury him because they buried their dead they buried Abraham they buried Isaac they B buried Jacob They Carried the bones of of Joseph back with them to the promised land so it has nothing to do with buing your dead or something like that or paying last\n (16:40) respects to someone who has who has passed away or to show grief with those who are crying it has to do with veneration it has to do with worship so God separated the worship systems that involved the dead as far as the East is from the west from his worship system there was to be no question as to any\n (17:06) veneration of the Dead whatsoever whatsoever it had to be totally separated so God said no one will come into my temple and worship over dead bodies that doesn't mean you can't bury someone who has died I'm not talking about that it's talking about worship and whosoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open field\n (17:32) or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean 7even days numbers 1916 so you want to come into contact with Graves why was this so why did God make this very strong distinction because paganism believes in the veneration of the Dead in Africa where I come from all the great religions are based purely on the\n (18:06) veneration of the Dead the ancestors are the ones through whom everyone is worshiped including Christ Catholicism fits like a glove into that situation because Catholicism teaches the veneration of the Dead the saint so and so and Saint so and so and Saint the other and Saint whoever and you go through the saint to\n (18:30) God and now in the African system you go through the ancestor to God in the in the in the Indian in the red Indian culture do exactly the same thing it's based on paganism that's all they know so God made a very clear distinction and said listen there is no veneration of the Dead in fact I don't want you to\n (18:50) have anything to do with this you cannot come into contact with these with these entities of the dead and presume them to be active on your behalf because they're dead dead is dead and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron and say to them there shall none be defiled for the dead amongst the people\n (19:14) Leviticus 211 very very clear distinctions very clear but the world today does not believe in the death of the Dead they believe the lie that the devil spoke and they believed in continued life after death some in Bliss and those are the ones that you contact the Bible says none of them none of them\n (19:38) contact with any one of them is akin to Witchcraft is akin to Witchcraft now let's have a look at the cathedrals of the world today the cathedrals of the world today are all built on Ancient Pagan worship sites no Cathedral May be without dead bodies and Graves or else it is not a cathedral a cathedral is in\n (20:06) fact a Mory it is a graveyard and God said you're not to come into contact with the graves of the Dead when you come to worship him stay away from the temple for seven days you can grieve that's fair enough but don't come to my temple I'm making a difference between paganism and the god of the living I am\n (20:28) not the god of the dead I'm the god of the living stay away from this this issue I am the god worship me don't worship through any Dead Man's Bones well the cathedrals are not only ancient Pagan worship sites all the great Cathedrals notredam St Paul's all of them all those Cathedrals are built on Ancient Pagan\n (20:54) sites and they were all built in exactly the same fashion as was the dudic system you used to have a Channel of stones huge pillar Stones leading up to a central circle in which was a central Stone which is the circle with the dot on it the ancient Pagan sexual symbol of unification between the two deities the\n (21:20) male and the female and propagation of life through the fertility right it's pretty weird now the ancient Cathedrals are built exactly the same way these pillars that you have the giant pillars in the cathedral represent those stones and in the ancient cathedrals in the past you always used to have a circular Garden\n (21:44) behind with a stone in the center as in the dudic system and many of the cathedrals today still have that so when you look down the passage you used to come into the circle down the passage these great pillars on the side represent the channel of the Sun and they're built in that way as well and you walk through and you walked through\n (22:07) the Regeneration cycle into the sexual occult setting of the circular Grove where the hidden God either pan or the god of the woods Diana or one of them was situated and as you walk down this aisle you are walking on the bodies of men it is necromancing it is the age old dudic system in fact you are not allowed to\n (22:36) say a mass in any in any church setting in these religious systems without there being the bone of a dead Saint under the altar you have to have a bone because only through the Dead Man's Bones or a portion of him whatever the portion is can you actually find access to god wow that is something that God strictly\n (23:03) forbade and something which is generally practiced today so in the dudic system this is what you had there you had the circular ston hedge in the past there used to be the channel the walkway of stones on either side and then they covered it up on the sides they put a steeple on the front and that was the\n (23:25) cathedral it's built and based on dudic worship of the ancestors of the Dead these are modern day drudes and you will see that they are dressed very much like nuns interesting well here is one of the great cathedrals in Europe and you will see here is one of the circular Gardens this today placed on the side and in it\n (23:50) when you go walking through it you will find the graves and you will find the ancient sites in the cathedrals you will have numerous bodies of whoever it is kings and queens and dead people and Saints and just anybody as long as there are lots of bodies but largely important people so here in these Cathedrals\n (24:11) you'll find all these graveyards something which God strictly forbade here you have the tombs this is Edward the Kings lying in state with the pine cones and all the regalia that deals with paganism and they will make them prominent as you enter into the churches here in this Roman Catholic Cathedral there's a giant tomb right\n (24:36) there you walk into the graveyard something that God said you should never do here is an interesting Cathedral that I found in Germany there's the symbol of the Sun God by the way there is the altar so either in the altar or under directly under the altar there will be a tomb now normally you don't see it from\n (24:56) inside the church you have to go looking outside the church for an entrance or a side entrance somewhere but in this particular one the entrance was right in the churches went down and then you can go under the Altar and of course there has to be a tomb down there or else you cannot say the mass because it's\n (25:14) veneration of the dead and I went down and stuck my camera through there just to show you the tomb there it is and the altar is up there in the top that's worship of the Dead some nice tombs this is in in the cathedrals in London and in Europe wherever you go and then as you walk down the highways of these Cathedrals\n (25:39) you will find that you are walking on dead men's bones all over the place and this is John uh gent and he died on the 13th of August 1767 and you will find others now in the system the god of the Dead was either Seb in the Egyptian system and later he became Satan the Saturn God and the symbol of Saturn was the skull with the\n (26:11) two bones which is also the symbol of course that pirates use and that is the symbol of the god of the dead but that's not the symbol of Jesus Christ This is a Roman Catholic cathedral in Europe at the top there you have the phix this is a symbol of Lucifer that's not a symbol of Jesus Christ and there you have\n (26:33) anubus they don't even hide it anubus the god of the Dead the god of the Egyptian dead so choose are we serving the god of the dead or are we serving the god of the living either one or the other now what about Catholicism in general the pope amongst us the benit beatification of Father Joseph gerod just as a modern day example when\n (26:59) a human being is uh beatified declared to be a saint and you'll be surprised that who is declared to be a saint anybody who does something for Rome is declared to be a saint they're discussing the beatification of Conrad Adin now so wow soon you'll be able to pray to him too well in any case here again is the symbol of the Sun in front\n (27:22) of him and in Catholicism the veneration of the Dead is very very prominent that's why the ancient Pagan religions associate readily with Catholicism in this particular Monastery here are the bones and the skeletons of all the monks that have ever lived throughout the ages of Catholicism in this particular\n (27:46) Monastery here when you died you didn't get buried you were set aside for a while until you were cleaned up and then uh you became part of the decoration and when you go into this place it is claimed that you can benefit from their righteous works because in their lives these monks con um did more righteous Works than they needed to go\n (28:11) to heaven so there's an excess of righteousness there's sort of a basin out of which you can take a little bit to top up your lack of righteousness and I'm not making a joke this is Catholic Doctrine I know I'm a Catholic I was a Catholic myself was a Catholic here you go take some of this righteousness walk\n (28:31) through there and pray to the dead here are all the bones and the skulls standing over there at gapuchi in Rome so you can pray to these Saints you can ask for them to mediate and you can borrow from their excess righteousness to top up yours and Jesus Christ who is the only mediator between man and God is\n (28:54) marginalized you never talk to him you know you have to have a special audience through all these dead men's bones to get there now when you go to Islam it's exactly the same religion Islam is also the veneration of the dead and it is exactly the same as Catholicism in this sense that's why behind the scenes there\n (29:18) is no problem between the religions this is the famous umay mosque in Syria the oldest mosque by the way this is the mosque that the Pope chose to make his um apology for all the Deeds that uh happened in the past in the name of religion and I stood in this mosque and I was stunned to see what was going on\n (29:44) here here you can see the muslims praying at this particular Shrine this is a fascinating Shrine because in this particular Shrine here in the umat mosque there lies the body of an interesting personage and in fact it's not the whole body it's just the head of that particular entity that is here somewhere buried under one of these\n (30:10) pillars and that's what makes the mosque a place of worship uh any guesses as to whose head is in that mosque John the Baptist now you might be stunned to hear that John the Baptist who is revered by Christians should be here in this mosque revered by Muslims and finding special Grace from the head of John the Baptist well the\n (30:43) pope was here and also paid special homage of course to this particular skull in there I don't know whether it really is the head of John the Baptist fortunately the Roman Catholic Church is not totally devoid of this luxury because they have the arm of John the Baptist in one of their cathedrals in\n (31:06) Istanbul you see so between the two of them maybe they can find some of the rest of the pieces as well I don't know but isn't it sad to have this ritual of praying to the dead for dust Thou Art and dust unto dust Thou shalt return Genesis 3:19 in Adam all die 1 Corinthians 15:22 so all mankind that was in Adam is\n (31:39) subject to death that's the bottom line and death is non-life you're dead and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul Genesis 2:7 then shall the Dust return to the Earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it it returns\n (32:04) to God it's not the entity it's the ru the breath the lifegiving principle which returns to God and then you cease to live Ecclesiastes 12:7 all the while let's read what happens here job 27:3 all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of God is in my nostrils that is Hebrew parallelism that equates the breath with\n (32:35) the spirit as one in other words he's saying this is the situation this is the situation repeating it in other words so Hebrew parallelism as we have seen also in the concordance equates this lifegiving principle the spirit with the breath the lifegiving principle of God all the while my breath this lifegiving\n (32:59) principle the fact that I breathe means that I am alive and the spirit of God is in my nostrils this breath is in my nostrils that is why I'm alive if God should take this breath this lifegiving principle away from me what happens to me I'm dead I die listen to this Ezekiel 18 verse4 the soul neish that sinth\n (33:28) it shall die so people say ha I die but my soul remains alive no no no the soul is the entity that is alive that is the body plus the the ru plus the spirit and when I die in sin I die the soul the the fish the living entity dies it ceases to exist so the soul is not a separate entity that goes and sits on cloud n and\n (34:02) plays the harp I always thought that was going to be terribly boring to one day die and sit on a cloud and play the H the King James version uses the word Soul 1,600 times but never once uses the term Immortal Soul doesn't exist there's no such thing only God is Immortal the Bible declares that death is asleep 53\n (34:30) times of course you are asleep when you are in Christ because Christ is the god of the living so when you die the Bible says if you are in Christ you are as though you are just asleep God will wake you up at the latter day let's see what happens when you die but a man dieth and wasteth away yeah a man giveth up the\n (34:56) ghost the ru the spirit and where is he job 14:10 but man dies and is cut off that is the new King James version of the same text and man expires and where is he you see this word ghost over there is the word expires it's a very good translation so look carefully at your translations the word expire means to breathe your life L\n (35:28) isn't that right he breathes his l so the breath goes from him the life principle goes from him Hebrews die give up the ghost dead perish expire be about to die that's what it means and how long will he remain in that state job 14:12 till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor will be raised out\n (35:59) of their sleep that's the teaching of the Bible so when you die it is Ain to a state of sleep for how long until the heavens are no more and when will that take place by the way the Bible says that when Christ Returns the heavens will roll up like a scroll so at the return of Christ there is an Awakening from the sleep so you\n (36:27) die you know nothing you sleep until the resurrection day you will not awake nor will you be raised from that sleep let's have a look at the Practical example that Jesus left behind John 11:1 our friend Lazarus sleepeth Lazarus was a friend of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was a friend of Lazarus our friend Lazarus sleepeth\n (36:57) but I go that I may awake him out of his sleep now the disciples thought well this man is talking about a sick Lazarus who is asleep Lord if he sleep he shall do well how be it Jesus spoke of his death but Jesus called it asleep but they thought he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep then said Jesus unto them\n (37:22) plainly Lazarus is dead see Lazarus is dead but for Christ Lazarus was what asleep because Christ is the god of the living not the god of the dead so here he was he was asleep now what about Abraham to Christ Abraham is what sleeping that's what it's all about so Lazarus is dead but to Christ he was\n (37:50) just asleep God does not forget the dead they are in Christ he has the hard dis he has the full record of your entity as you were and when he says restore there you are perfect like you were better Lord if thou been here my brother had not died John 11:21 so now when Jesus comes to Lazareth he's confronted\n (38:20) by Mary who says if only you'd been here he would not have died thy brother shall shall rise again John 11:23 Jesus Comforts her and says what's your problem don't you have faith your brother will rise again and let's listen to her answer she answers John 11:24 I know that he is now in heaven and one day he will come again and\n (38:47) return to his body at the resurrection is that what it says there no no it says I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day so what is the Biblical teaching about death the Biblical teaching about death is you die and it's a state of sleep total unconsciousness but Christ will raise\n (39:16) you on the latter day and to show that he had power over death he raised Lazarus from the dead but Lord by this time there's a bad odor for he has been there 4 days John 11:39 but he said to him Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came out and said Lord why did you call me up I was having such fun in heaven not a word not a word Lazarus\n (39:46) continued with his life he as if he had woken out of asleep there's no question that he was not in heaven or anywhere else during that time period and when thy days be fulfilled Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers 2 Samuel 7:12 to Daniel he said read the last verse of Daniel he says Daniel you shall sleep and you shall rise again in the\n (40:15) latter days to receive your allotted inheritance they're all asleep in Christ is there a conscious existence after death where we have to answer this question it's very important well Psalms 1464 says his breath this Ru this lifegiving principle the spirit of God returns to God Goes Forth forth returnest to his Earth in\n (40:45) that very day his thoughts perish so when you die there's no thinking no cognitive thought for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything also their love their hatred their Envy is now perished Ecclesiastes 95 and 6 so when Prince Charles of England consults Lord mount Batton who is\n (41:14) dead who's he talking to he's not talking to Lord mount patney he might think so but my Bible says that Lord M Batton won't help him anything because his thought have perished his not there the dead praise not the Lord neither any that go down into silence Psalms 11517 so when you die people say that person is now in\n (41:42) heaven in the presence of God praising God no not so Psalms 11517 says the dead praise not the Lord neither any that go down into silence there's nothing down there nothing nothing just silence for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks Psalm 6:5 nobody for that which\n (42:10) befalleth the sons of men Beth the beasts there's no difference between the way an animal dies and man dies it says that which Beth the sons of men Beth the Beast even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other so animals and man die the same way they all have one breath one breath now many\n (42:35) churches teach that people when they die go to heaven but animals don't because they don't have a soul that's not biblical there's the Bible text and the Bible may not contradict itself everybody dies the same way that animal has exactly the same metabolism as any human being any scientist can tell you\n (42:57) that I can transplant an animal's organ and put it into a human being and if we can get rid of the problem of rejection you'll probably survive so there's no difference between the way an animal lives and the way a human lives the only difference is that a human makes cognitive decisions in his life and is\n (43:21) subject to the Reckoning of God and therefore in Christ or out of Christ so animals die the same way as humans they all have one Spirit ruach lifegiving principle so that man has no preeminence over a beast isn't that interesting we must read the Bible carefully Isaiah 38:18 there is beautiful Harmony throughout the Bible\n (43:54) for the grave cannot praise thee death cannot celebrate the they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth the decision has to be made now not like later whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest Ecclesiastes 9:10 so\n (44:21) when you are dead you are dead if you want to do something do it now if you want to make right with someone you've had a problem with do it now you can't do it later you can't come back as a ghost and sort it out and fight forever and ever and talk about haunted houses and whatever that's theology that's\n (44:39) spiritism imagine how much confusion could be avoided if people accepted the biblical Doctrine on death what about this now this is the birthplace of modern spiritualism upon the s stood the Hydesville Cottage the home of the fox sisters and this is their Stone their Mory Stone March 311 1848 There Is No Death there are no dead\n (45:13) is that God language or serpent language serpent it's serpent language very interesting there they are the three Fox sisters they're the ones that started modern spiritism because they heard the wrappings and they were tap tap tap tap and then the spirits were tap tap tap tap tap and so the communication the\n (45:36) modern communication with the spirit world opened up to the Western World of course in the ancient cultures it had always been there in the African culture in the Egyptian culture in the Babylonian culture in the Eastern culture consultation with the dead was always practiced but for the modern Western Christian in mind this was the\n (45:59) opening wedge spiritualism says that the dead know more than the living and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die Genesis 3:4 spiritism says you know more you know more in this this is now quoting them as in many other Bible passages the devil told the truth and the Lord is in error ew sprag spiritualist wow so the\n (46:27) Lord lied and the Lord was in error and the devil is the one who is the truth that's great spiritism claims that the dead are not dead the fundamental principle of spiritism is that the human beings survive bodily death and that occasionally under conditions not yet fully understood we can communicate with\n (46:47) those who have gone before this is J Arthur Hill spiritism history phenomen and Doctrine page 25 so they say You're Not Dead the Bible says you're dead one of the two is wrong right or wrong one of the two is wrong spiritism claims that the dead communicate with the living there is no death in the graveyard I have frequent talks with the\n (47:10) dead I cannot doubt that people live after death for I frequently talk with them sir Oliver Lodge wow in fact spiritism is alive and practiced at the highest levels of society today at the highest levels of society kings and queens and Emperors and presidents they all practice it very interesting something which the Bible forbids the\n (47:41) progressive thinker May 18 1929 said what spiritualism is and does it removes all fear of death which is really the portal to the spirit world this is Eastern mysticism this is Osiris worship this is Anubis it teaches that death is not the cessation of life but a mere change of condition spiritualism is God's message\n (48:03) to Mortals declaring There Is No Death that all who have passed on still live that there is hope in the life beyond for the most sinful that every soul will progress Through the Ages to Heights Sublime and glorious where God is love and love is God and always say look at India look at Kolkata how thousands of years of\n (48:32) reincarnation has improved the quality of life there it's ridiculous it's the most pathetic lie in the universe and the devil spun it and the world believes it that's the fact of the matter as a cloud vanishes and is gone so he who goes down to the Grave does not return turn he will never come to his house again job 7:9 and 10 you\n (49:03) cannot talk with the dead because the dead know not anything if you talk to the dead you are talking to a demon who says I am what I am I've got types of these my father-in-law was deeply steeped into spiritualism he was a very prominent new Agia he believed all this stuff I can tell you stories that you\n (49:31) will not believe don't miss the lecture tomorrow night the New Age movement wow his sons come to honor and he knoweth it not what do we preach at the graveside they're looking down upon you don't be sad and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them job 14:21 what Comfort my mother never saw my my\n (49:59) mistakes and my bad moves or or whatever she's asleep when a few years are come then I shall go the way whence I shall not return job 16:22 until the Lord comes and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment Hebrews 9:27 wh there goes reincarnation goodbye either you believe the Bible or you\n (50:29) believe the lie one of the two there is no reincarnation there is no cycle there is no second chance it's now or never you are appointed once to die and then there is a resurrection and it's judgment whether we like it or not and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto Wizards\n (50:54) that peep in that matter that they Peep and they might they make funny noises should not a people seek unto their God for the living to the dead what are you doing consulting the dead Isaiah 8:19 talk to God don't consult the dead don't consult the stars and the spiritists and the Wizards and the necromancers to the law and to the\n (51:19) testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them Isaiah 8:20 if they do not speak according to the Bible forget about them forget about them they're lying so spiritism and death are in unity but God and life are in unity regard not them that have familiar spirits neither seek after\n (51:47) Wizards to be defiled by them I am the Lord your God Leviticus 19:31 put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help his breath goeth forth his ruach his life returneth to his earth goes back to dust and that very day his thoughts perish 146 3 and 4 so was the ancient Egyptians that believed the\n (52:13) Pagan doctrine of immortality of the soul and they taught this fervently in Alexandria now do you know what's interesting that the Jews were just like people people today they thought they could get a better education at the universities of the world so they went to study the Theology of the Nations and\n (52:37) many of them received their education in Alexandria the sades was such a class the sades believed that when you died you went straight to heaven and there you sat on Abraham's lap how comfortable it was and if you had something to pray about you prayed to Abraham who was dead to communicate to God that's ancestral\n (53:06) worship you pray through Abraham to God you use an in between one and they taught as they learned here in Egypt in Alexandria that when you died you went either to the good place or you went to the hot place that's in nubis Osiris worship the Pharisees on the other hand believed in whatre they believed in the death and\n (53:31) the resurrection and when Paul was brought before the son hedrin because it's surprising what bed fellows you find when you are opposing God when it came to opposing Christ the Pharisees and the Sadducees were in perfect harmony with each other buddies bed fellows and when Paul was confronted later he\n (53:59) was in a bit of trouble there so he threw this Gauntlet at them and he says I a Pharisee I believe in the resurrection and remember what happened there they started fighting so much amongst themselves they didn't even know what to do with Paul anymore it's interesting so this is what the ancient Egyptians believed so ancestor worship\n (54:22) in most cases is simply spiritualism of the East which seres serves as the exponent of immortality contact with the other world page 14 that's what it's bottom line is and he doeth great wonder and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by means of those Miracles which he had power to do Revelation 13\n (54:43) spiritualism is going to play a major role in the deceptions of the last days I will show you slides they will stun you in lecture that's coming up called signs and wonders don't miss it for they are spirits of devils working miracles Revelation 16:14 when Mary appears to the Christian Catholic world\n (55:08) or to the Islamic world as she frequently in inverted Comas does who's appearing Mary's asleep Mary is asleep awaiting the resurrection so who's appearing it's a demon masquerading as Mary and no Marvel forsake Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Life 2 Corinthians 11:14 the devil assumes the\n (55:33) role of Christ he comes as Mata and says I am your brother who through many cycles have done this and that and the other what have you what a load of nonsense if he's so great because he had so many cycles then everybody is great according to that Doctrine because everybody had the same amount of Cycles\n (55:53) right why should he then be better than the others but they're all dead none of them live so they are demonic Satan and Mary appearances exactly the same or Gaia appearances or Vishnu or Sia or Lord whoever all one and the same Matthew 72223 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have I not prophesied in thy\n (56:21) name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity anomia against the lord of the law of God Ephesians says in 611 put on the whole armor of God you cannot just believe bits and pieces of the\n (56:45) Bible you got to take the whole armor that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil if a spirit being walks in here now and claim claims to be Jesus Christ as has happened in Mexico when thousands of people fell down at a football stadium where he appeared and worshiped him hello who's appearing there if you want\n (57:11) to stand against these strange manifestations then we must be armed with the Bible well some people say what about the thief on the cross Jesus said to him you will be with me in heaven let's go through this carefully and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom Luke 23:42 that day was the\n (57:36) Friday and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise Luke 23:43 so you see the thief was with Christ in heaven on the day that he died well it depends where you put that comma because that comma was not there in the original text in fact the space between the words was not\n (58:00) even there in the original text it was one big block so it could also read if you shift the comma today to there verily I say unto thee today shalt thou be with me in Paradise or you shalt be with me in Paradise so now we have to ask the question Jesus was the thief with you after his death on that day the Friday\n (58:27) was he with you in Paradise yes or no well firstly he couldn't have been because he wasn't dead yet because the Bible says that that when the Sabbath was drawing clothes to a clothes uh they were saying to the to the Romans you better check these guys they're still alive so they went to what do what with\n (58:48) their bones break their bones but when they came to Christ he was already dead now they broke the bones so that they couldn't climb down from the cross on a Sabbath because it would have been a sacrilege to chase them on a Sabbath day you see that would be breaking the Sabbath so break their bones and they\n (59:05) can't do that so firstly he wasn't dead on the Sabbath he still lived past that and secondly he wasn't in heaven Jesus did not Ascend to heaven on the day of his crucifixion he slept in the grave let's check that out Mary Magdalene comes to the Grave Sunday morning and Jesus Jesus said unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascended\n (59:30) to my father so he couldn't have been with the thief in heaven because he had not ascended to his father but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God so early on the first day of the week Jesus ascended unto Heaven he wasn't there on that Friday and that\n (59:53) evening he was back because he appeared among amongst the disciples so on that day he went to the father and the father accepted his sacrifice so the thief was not with Christ in heaven on that day so Christ said verily verily I say unto you today you will be with me in heaven God does not forget the dead if a\n (1:00:20) man die shall he live again all the days of appointed time will I wait till my change Come Thou shalt call and I will answer thee thou will have a desire to the work of thine hands job 14:14 and 15 so he will die he will sleep and Christ desires he longs to be with his people he cannot wait for the day of the Resurrection so the dead\n (1:00:49) sleep in Christ and on the day of the Resurrection Jesus says come forth I'm here and they wake up but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive Christ the first fruits afterwards they that are christs\n (1:01:17) when at his coming now the Bible says that there was a wave offering a first fruits offering now when Christ rose from the dead there was an earthquake or when he died there was an earthquake and what happened Graves opened and the dead rose certain select dead rose and those dead are the first fruits of the resurrection and are with\n (1:01:48) Christ in heaven so some are in heaven already then there are a few others that are in heaven as well Enoch never died he went to heaven he was translated Elijah he didn't die he was translated and went to heaven Moses died but was resurrected because the book of Jude says that there was contention over\n (1:02:14) him and Elijah Moses Enoch and a number of others who serve as priests together with Christ because there were 20 2 4 Elders together 25 Elders together with Christ in uh or in the Earthly sanctuary and so there are also Elders serving in the courts above so some are alive I shall be satisfied when I awake\n (1:02:45) with thy likeness we will be transformed into the likeness of Christ Psalm 17:15 yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold and not another so it's not a ghost I will see him as I am wonderful thoughts according to the Lord's own word this is all scripture we tell you\n (1:03:12) that we who are still alive who are left till the coming of the Lord so when the Lord comes there will be the living who are in Christ and there will be the Dead who are asleep in Christ well certainly not preedee those who have fallen asleep for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the\n (1:03:34) Archangel with the trumpet call of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first one Thessalonians 4:15 and 16 after that we who are still alive so the living at the end of time and our left will be caught up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air the clouds Hebrew parallelism I'll de deal with it\n (1:04:01) in a later lecture are angels so the Angels gather the elect and they meet the Lord in the air and so we will be with the Lord forever 1 Thessalonians 4:17 so that's the Biblical teaching Christ Returns the dead in Christ are raised the living are translated together the one not preceding the other meets the Lord in the\n (1:04:27) air we shall sleep until he comes and knocks on the little grave and says Dr Martin get up then I shall rise in a moment and be happy with him forever the Christian hope page 37 that's what Martin Luther taught Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in in that which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and\n (1:04:48) shall come forth John 5 2829 and he that has the son he will have life and he that does not have the Son of God he will not have life we will have to deal with this very carefully 1 John 512 now to the king Eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God the honor and Glory forever and ever amen one Timothy 117 God is Immortal not we\n (1:05:15) we have immortality by Grace behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye when at the last trumpet for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on\n (1:05:41) immortality 1 Corinthians 15:51 and onwards so we see that the Bible is consistent throughout on this topic these all died in their faith not having received the promises Paul lists a whole whole list of Great Men And he says they died without having received the promises but having seen them a far off and were persuaded of them and\n (1:06:05) embraced them and confessed them that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth Hebrews 11:13 the promise of the earth made new is coming in the future the dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they rise awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust for the Dew is as the Jew of herbs and the Earth shall\n (1:06:26) cast out the dead Isaiah 26:19 the biblical Doctrine is so clear I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live John 11:25 so here are these two great distinctions now what about the texts in the Bible where it talks about K Hellfire all of these interesting things\n (1:06:50) what happens to the wicked what happens to them what is all this about Revelation 616 and 17 and he said to the mountains and the Rocks Fallen us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the wroth of the lamb for the great day of his wroth is come and who shall be able to stand so the one class the\n (1:07:15) dead in Christ rise the living righteous are translated together they meet the Lord in the air there's another class the living Wicked and the dead Wicked Matthew 1028 and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the nephesh the living entity but rather fear him which is able to destroy\n (1:07:43) destroy both soul and Body in Hell doctrine of Hell well the word used there is what does it mean let's have a look at it the Hebrew origin hell is the place of future punishment called K Ora of fire this was originally the valley of hom south of Jerusalem where the filth and the dead animals of the\n (1:08:16) city were cast out and burnt a fit symbol of the wicked and their future destruction so there you have the concordance explanation of this world so the word refers to the valley where the dead bodies were burnt destroyed by the way how long did those bodies burn until they were gone until they were burnt gone now the Greek\n (1:08:47) Hades and the Hebrew sha which is used in the Bible and which is often referred to as hell for the doctrine of hell is the place of the dead so it's the grave you go down into the pit you go down into Shaw into the grave you go down into Hades the grave and it's often translated also as hell so here you have\n (1:09:11) the two possibilities for this doctrine of Hell the one is K this fire that burns which was a symbol of this Valley of hon and the other one is Hades or Sha then he shall say unto them on his left hand depart from me ye cursed it into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels Matthew 25:41 now what is this Everlasting fire\n (1:09:42) these are the symbols that are used to explain the doctrine of hell now this is what s Hopsin wrote Catholic Doctrine is the following the smoke of their torment shall send up forever in the sight of the Blessed Before Their Eyes this display of the Divine character and Glory will be in favor of the redeemed\n (1:10:04) aha so Catholic Doctrine says that if those burning down there the contrast between the redeemed and those burning is very great and is in favor of the redeemed and most entertaining interesting and give the highest pleasure to those who love God should the eternal torment and fire speak distinguished it would be in a\n (1:10:26) great measure put an end to the happiness and glory of the Blessed that's a very warped idea of blessing and happiness it's a pretty sick idea so this idea of the eternally damned and the eternally blessed is a is a heavy Roman Catholic concept Ezekiel 33:11 says as I live says the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked qu\n (1:10:51) God doesn't take pleasure in them dying but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will you die a house of Israel God is not this character that is portrayed there I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth Ezekiel 1832 this is a sword in the heart of\n (1:11:15) this Catholic Doctrine Catholic religion Martin page 290 the Council of Trent decided in purgatory the souls can themselves white white their debt only by suffering so here he's taught another sort of in between station you have hell or you have eternal torment but if you weren't so bad you could burn off some of your\n (1:11:37) some of your sins beforehand either God forgives you or he doesn't let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon as far as the East is from the West he will remove your sins from you there's no halfway\n (1:11:59) station where you need a blowtorch to burn off the rest that wasn't perfected so the doctrine of purgatory is not biblical either so what about the story of the rich man and Lazarus well we've already explained Jesus was talking to the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the sades taught that when you died you went straight to\n (1:12:22) heaven or straight to hell that was Alexandre Doctrine that's where they received their training and by the way they also as we said taught that they were going to the lap of Abraham and now jesus takes their story and he turns it upside down they also taught that if you were great and good and wonderful on\n (1:12:42) this Earth and if you were one of the elect Born Into the elect Society you went straight to the to Abraham's lap well jesus takes their and he takes everything they stand for and turns it upside down the rich man goes to the bad place he stands for Israel who had all this knowledge and the poor man who had nothing but SES the\n (1:13:10) sinful one who waited for the crumbs the little bit of doctrine that could fall from the table of Israel he received nothing he went to Abraham's lab and the ones then down there he said Father Abraham father Abraham please can I not just send someone a message that uh my brothers can be warned now what is wrong with that story\n (1:13:40) people make that a literal story firstly all the redeemed on Abraham's lap that's not biblical secondly he's praying asking Father Abraham to do something for him that's veneration of the Dead so all those doctrines in that parallel strike directly at the heart of sadal teaching and kills it this is a story\n (1:14:06) that turns the doctrine of the sades upside down and shows them the bigotry of that story that the wicked is reserved to the day of what does it say there destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wroth Job 21:30 in the Bible you must put the text together and let the plain texts explain\n (1:14:33) the not so plain ones and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal now the question is is the punishment going to continue forever and ever or is the consequence of the punishment ment Eternal that is the question we must answer and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire\n (1:15:03) this is the second death aha so the first death is the one that you die literally when you die then you can be raised to judgment and the Lake of Fire is the second death so you die a second time and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire which is what the second death so how long will\n (1:15:36) the wicked burn is it an everlasting suffering or is the consequence Everlasting but the wicked Shall Perish and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke they shall consume away psalms 37:20 now the Bible says they will be burnt and burn away so the consequences\n (1:16:09) of the fire of the K just like those animals died out there and were burnt or those that had burnt burnt away until there were no more they will be destroyed they will burn and they consume away and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them Revelation 29 so they will be consumed away for\n (1:16:34) behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up says the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch Malachi 4:1 they shall burn away examples in the Bible turning to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes\n (1:17:01) condemned them with an overthrow making them an example example unto those that after should live ungodly now they suffered the consequences of Eternal fire did the fire burn eternally or are the consequences eternally in terms of Sodom and Gomorrah is Sodom and Gomorrah still burning out there no but it's gone for\n (1:17:26) how long forever that's the Hebrew concept of extent forever forever the concept is that the consequence is forever even as Sodom and Gomorrah this is Jude 7even even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner given themselves over to fornification and going after the strange flesh are\n (1:17:48) set forth as an example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire it's an example of The Eternity of that judgment they shall be as though they had not been 16 in other words the wicked will one day perish and be gone God does not burn them forever and ever and ever how incredibly unjust that would be for a short life of wrongdoing\n (1:18:29) to be eternally tormented that's not the character of God that's a character of another one the Bible does not teach that the Bible is distorted into teaching that but it doesn't teach that and you shall trample the wicked for they shall be what ashes Under The Souls of your feet on the day which I am preparing says the Lord of\n (1:18:54) hosts so here's the bottom line if you have Christ you rise in the resurrection if you are alive when he comes you will be translated together with the righteous they meet the Lord in the air and they live for how long forever forever in Christ there is life without Christ there is no life there is death you will rise you will be judged\n (1:19:23) you will know why why you will not have eternal life fire comes down from heaven you suffer the torment OFA that is being extinguished just like that gone for how long forever forever and you shall trample the wicked there shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day which I'm preparing says the Lord of\n (1:19:50) hosts Malachi 4:3 what happens to Satan does he live forever are we ever and ever and ever going to be reminded of the wickedness and the sadness of this planet no Ezekiel 28819 says will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee talking about Satan it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth in\n (1:20:15) the sight of all them that behold thee and never shalt thou be anymore amen is that clear it's so plain but it can be readily distorted if you want to and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up this Earth is going to be cleansed by fire Peter 3:10 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some encount\n (1:20:49) slackness but he longsuffering to us with not willing that any should should perish but that all should come to repentance one chance you have this life to make a decision and at the end of this life you are either in Christ or you are not in Christ if you are in Christ you have life if you have not if\n (1:21:10) you're not in Christ you don't have life there shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation John 5:2 9 is that plain I think it's very plain for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be\n (1:21:34) changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal immortality then shall be brought to past the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory 1 Corinthians 15: 52-54 and then once sin has been removed Sinners have been removed demons have been removed forever God recreates the planet and I\n (1:22:05) saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away Revelation 211 and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away Revelation\n (1:22:35) 21:4 so rather than being in heaven and seeing the wicked burn for all eternity so that you can be delighted by their suffering there's no such sick Doctrine in the Bible that's a doctrine of paganism and it comes all the way from Babylon and is taught in the world and believed in the world by virtually every\n (1:23:01) religious System including Mainline Christianity and Mainline Christianity has gone so far as to bring in Pagan incrustations so that in the cathedrals of the world you are walking into Pagan temples of death the worship of anubus is not the worship of Christ the two are mutually exclusive and Christ promises that even\n (1:23:29) if you are sad there will be tears right up until this moment Christ will wipe the tears of your eyes and then there will be peace and happiness and no more sin on this planet that's the Biblical teaching on death now tomorrow we can deal with a New Age movement and then we can look at these fantastic\n (1:23:53) manifestations that we have today I will show you videos tomorrow I will show you things that you probably never heard of before and I will show you things as to who these people actually worship because they mention him by name and I'm not talking about Mickey Mouse people I'm talking about the prominent people of this world don't\n (1:24:20) miss tomorrow's lectures and come and look at the deception that Satan has prepared for the last days but if you believe what was on the screen tonight and what was in the Bible you will see the deception for what it is may the Lord bless you as you Ponder these things and even if you couldn't fully\n (1:24:39) grasp it all come again tomorrow and let us look at the deceptions we're going into the events of the last days now these are going to be thunderous lectures thank you for coming God bless you a [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music]

  "# Title:223_the_new_age_agenda_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nNew Age Agenda,Masonic Connections,Deception and Manipulation,False Christs,Biblical Warnings\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"The New Age Agenda,\" delves into a comprehensive \"total onslaught on Jesus Christ as sole Savior and also particularly the divinity of Jesus Christ.\" The speaker argues that various movements, often subtly guided by organizations like the Jesuits and Freemasonry, promote a \"universal Christ\" that rejects the biblical Jesus. Examples include Christian Science and Mormonism, both presented as having Masonic origins and teaching humanity's inherent godhood and the illusion of death. The lecture further connects this agenda to occultism, channeling, and the widespread promotion of a \"Cosmic Christ\" or \"Maitreya\" who will appear to unite all religions under a set of Luciferian doctrines, such as pantheism and reincarnation, ultimately challenging the unique role and teachings of Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible.\n\n## Content:\n(2) Total Onslaught 223 The New Age Agenda Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Vo8U9jKbQ\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] I've called this lecture the New Age agenda but it deals with actually more than just the New Age agenda the field is so vast you cannot really cover it by breaking it up into little components so basically all we're doing is we're creating puzzle pieces and putting them together eventually to form the whole\n\n(01:25) picture of a total onslaught on Jesus Christ as sole Savior and also particularly the divinity of Jesus Christ well who is behind the New Age movement once again sad to say but the same power seems to be everywhere behind the scenes scenes like a web like a spider's web covering every base a man attributed more than any other with\n\n(01:59) steering the new mate New Age movement is a man by the name of Teilhard de Chardin now who was Teilhard de Chardin well you should guess it by now a Jesuit priest Tylor dreamed of humanity merging into God and each realizing his own godhood at the Omega Point this belief has inspired many of today's new-age leaders\n\n(02:29) everyone has a quote every statement I make has a quote I never say anything in fact shardene is one of the most frequently quoted writers by leading New Age or cultists so the Jesuit movement again working stealthily behind the scenes the shardene himself wrote a general convergence of religions upon a universal Christ who satisfies\n\n(03:00) them all you see how fascinating that seems to me the only possible conversion of the world and the only form in which I religion the future can be conceived so once again if we're going to set up a Luciferian system and we saw that the Jesuit organization using Freemasonry has lifted up Lucifer to godhood and\n\n(03:31) renegade or degraded Jesus Christ once again they're looking for a universal Christ that satisfies them all but they do not want Jesus Christ because that is exclusivity the secrets of the Gnostics all these new-age writings are steeped in Gnosticism which removed Jesus as the focal point and replace him with Lucifer\n\n(04:04) or man as the final deity you had the Ebionites the mark unites the Gnostics and the Tama scenes all of them basically teaching that Jesus was just a mere mortal and that we in a sense are divine and the divinity of Christ is only to be reckoned with in the same terms as we are divided behind the scenes the Roman Catholic Church is\n\n(04:35) controlling occultism at every single level it even has specialized bishops like these wandering bishops who deal with the occult worlds this is a man by the name of Don Bosco and he had a vision or Roman Catholic visionary he had a vision in 1862 where he claimed that he saw the gospel ship land between the two pillars\n\n(05:02) of the faith in other words anchoring the gospel ship between the two pillars of the faith and the two pillars were number one the larger pillar of the Eucharist which meant that Jesus Christ had been sacrificed again and again and again and again actually the Eucharist which symbolizes the death on a daily basis through the\n\n(05:27) mass in fact on an hourly by the minute basis as they have worked it out ensures that Christ remains crucified dead crucified dead crucified dead it is the body of Christ natural fact the Eucharist then is the ultimate celebration of the victory of Lucifer over Christ and the second pillar which they claim is smaller has on it Mary\n\n(05:54) which simply means that Jesus has been replaced by another mediator so that is actually what this vision means of course in Catholic terms it means the acceptance of the Eucharist and Mary by the entire world now we must remember that in occultism Mary can be both male and female so whether you put a female\n\n(06:19) deity there Mary Isis Astrid whoever you want to put there or whether you put the male equivalent makes no difference because he's a neurogenic so you could put Apollo there the face of Apollo you could put a Cyrus there it could be any one of them it would be exactly the same thing because Blavatsky says they're one\n\n(06:39) in the same Genesis chapter 3 verse 1 to 6 now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman is eat so that God has said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden but\n\n(07:01) of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely die for God knows that in the day you eat of it then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as God's knowing good\n\n(07:29) and evil that was the original battle in eden question god had said you will surely die the serpent had said you will surely not die one of them is lying correct one of them is lying if you are surely dead then you are a created being and certainly not God and here the serpent says in fact if you eat of it you'll realize that you are\n\n(08:02) actually God's another lie these are the twin lies of Eden told by the serpent of course Freemasonry teaches that it was the other way around that it was the devil as we saw who told the truth and that yaver he's the liar that's what we saw in all those Freemason quotes so they turn it upside down this is their\n\n(08:29) four central Jesuit teaching because the Jesuits actually formed masonry and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food there's the old appetite problem coming in and that it was pleasing to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make wise that was the big problem there she took up the fruit and ate she also\n\n(08:56) gave to her husband with her and he ate good that was the battle in Eden if that was the beginning then the end will be the same the same victory that's the serpent God in the beginning he will try to claim at the end as well so starting with Mary Baker Eddy their fear is the founder of the Christian Science\n\n(09:23) movement we're starting to get organizations which give themselves Christian labels but which teach everything which is not Christian this is a very clever move not everybody is duped by it but because the name Christian is associated with it that means it must at least have Christian values right wrong she writes in science and health\n\n(09:51) with keys to the scriptures which was voted one of the 75 books by women whose words have changed the world by the us's Women's National Book Association so this is very influential work one of the 75 books written by women to change the world amazing now what did Mary Becca idiot to say here are some statements science and\n\n(10:14) health with key to the scriptures which this religious movement uses as a document in addition to the Bible evil has no reality it is neither person place nor thing but simply a belief an illusion of material sense page 71 well I always ask myself the question or what planet did she live on surely not this\n\n(10:39) one Jesus the highest human corporal real concept of the divine idea rebuking and destroying error and bringing to light man's immortality page 589 okay so Jesus is just an example to show us that we are immortal but didn't God say you will surely die didn't he say that yes he did but she says no man is immortal\n\n(11:07) let us remember that harmonious and immortal man has existed forever page 302 the Bible says he's a created being man but she says no he's immortal he has existed forever death it's an illusion the lie of life will matter any material evidence of death is false for it contradicts a spiritual fact of being page 584 there's no death\n\n(11:32) who said he will surely not die the serpent said so the soul is the Divine Principle of man and never sins hence the immortality of the soul she writes man and women as coexistent eternal with God forever reflecting in glorified equality the infinite father mother god that's genique God we have here and this sounds\n\n(12:03) more like Lucifer than it sounds like God and this father mother God concept is not biblical otherwise it would have said our parent who art in heaven hallowed be thy name but it doesn't does it no says our Father who art in heaven so this is the one movement that gives itself a Christian name here's another movement that gives\n\n(12:27) itself a Christian name the Mormon movement the Mormons call themselves the Latter day Saints of Jesus Christ so this is Jesus Christ's name being used again and the information comes from this angel over there who is the angel Moroni here he stands on top of the cloud blowing his trumpet here is a typical Mormon Church it has no windows\n\n(12:54) just like Masonic lodges don't have any windows and the founder of the Mormon movement is none other than Joseph Smith and Joseph Smith was a 33 degree freemason what does that tell you who was his God if he was a 33 freemason degree freemason then he's God was Lucifer now this is his follower he's the next prophet if you like the Mormon\n\n(13:25) leader Brigham Young who followed up job as Joseph Smith and he happened to be a 33 degree freemason well let's check this out the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints Mormonism its founder Joseph Smith was a high-level freemason his successor Brigham Young was also another high freemason according to the\n\n(13:47) book black robe but Brigham Young was an intimate friend friend of Peter the Smiths one of the most powerful American Jesuits of the 19th century Oh we find them everywhere but they're never in the front row they're always in the back row so that they never get bumps the others get bounced well here\n\n(14:09) Joseph received from the angel Moroni the gold tablets with this new doctrine on it now let's ask him himself whether what I'm saying is correct so it's always good to go to his own writings his history of the church in the evening I received the first degree in Freemasonry and the Naaru Lodge assembled in my general\n\n(14:31) business office I was with a Masonic Lodge and rose to the sublime degree you have it straight from the horse's mouth it cannot be denied Mormonism was started by Freemasonry under the control of who the Jesuits yes now what would be their principal move to start an organization that controls one whole\n\n(14:56) state at least in the United States and together with Freemasonry controls the entire space program because anybody who has ever been in space is either freemason or is a Mormon one of the two very interesting not only that they are the organization which have the greatest database on anyone ever living they will find out\n\n(15:23) everything from who you are who your parents are where you live what you did every single thing about you they have the bad database this is a database that will be important one day when it comes to buying and selling and who's going to get what in the new dispensation so they perform a very important work\n\n(15:44) for the Jesuit Order if you look at Mormonism they have the same sort of ritual is Freemasonry they have their aprons the handshakes are a little bit different as you see they have their secret handshakes and all the paraphernalia that goes along with it and this is their main temple at Salt Lake City again you can see it's a\n\n(16:09) pretty shut up place and when you go and look there you'll see the old seeing eye with the Masonic handshake in it you'll see the moon and the ball are Doug's symbol and the Sun and the upside-down pentagrams former witch mason Mormon and Satanist bill Schneider land emphasized that to the magician the inverted pentagram has one\n\n(16:36) use only and that is to call up the power of Satan and bring the kingdom of the devil into manifestation on earth so here is the symbol right on the Masonic Temple I took these pictures myself so I know they're there another quotes you will find the Satanic pentagram invaluable and indispensable if you in temptu attempt to draw from\n\n(16:58) the infernal power of our Lord Satan this extremely powerful amulet is the sign of the microcosm and it's the summation of all occult forces in other words there is no amulet or talisman more powerful or even close to as powerful as the Satanic pentagram it's interesting that it's on virtually every\n\n(17:18) flag in the world which is just another story so if we look at the Mormon temple we will find them in the upside iron down form relatively frequently all these symbols are all over at the Mormon temple the all-seeing eye over there down there symbols of the Sun they have circles originally they even had the dot\n\n(17:44) in the middle but they've become a little bit more clandestine and have removed those on their other churches at the same site you will find the Star of David all of these features are in Mormonism here the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood they claim that they have the priesthood of Aaron now by the\n\n(18:11) way there is a blasphemy because who has become the high priest forever Jesus this means they are taking upon themselves something that belongs to someone else they are robbing Jesus Christ of his role and his authority Kathy burns Masonic and occult symbols Illustrated says both masonry and Mormonism referred to the\n\n(18:42) Melchizedek Priesthood in Scottish Rite masonry the 19th degree is called the grand pontiff it is during this ceremony that the candidate is anointed with oil made and proclaimed a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek I thought there was only one who was of that order today isn't that so so both of them Mormonism\n\n(19:06) and Freemasonry do this Hebrews 5 5 9 tells us however that Christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but was called of God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek but our cultists Mormons masons glorify themselves and take on themselves the honor of priesthood that was given to Christ alone\n\n(19:28) so when we titled the cirrie total onslaught you can see that every aspect of the world out there is designed to rob Jesus of his power and his priesthood so many of these poor Mormons of course have no idea because again in Mormonism they are degrees and you get initiated into higher and higher levels\n\n(19:52) so the lower levels know absolutely nothing these poor little nun girls that walk around they're showing the people around saying these wonderful things that they have read and not realizing what they even say if you look here at the Mormon structures there I mean wow it is impressive money was obviously not\n\n(20:14) an object what about Mormon doctrine let's have a look at that quickly six and twenty seven doctrine of covenants verse 11 Mormons Mormons teach that Adam was God Journal of discourses volume four this is their official writing that some sins are turned for by own blood only what does that tell you well that's\n\n(20:40) not biblical the Book of Mormon almost 7 verse 10 says Jesus was born in Jerusalem that's not biblical it's minor but it's just irritating Journal of discourses volume 2 page 81 says Christ was married to Mary Martha and others that'll give you a good reason to have a little bit of you know one one wife why not they deny their\n\n(21:05) tournament we're going through the same ritual again one of the most pernicious doctrines ever advocated by man is the doctrine of justification by faith alone which has entered into the hearts of millions since the days of the so-called Reformation Joseph fielding Smith is Joseph Smith himself writing the\n\n(21:23) restoration of all things page 192 well doesn't that sound similar to what Westcott and Hort had to say yes or no well this is Masonic teaching and Mormonism is nothing other than a front for Freemasonry masquerading as a religion of Jesus Christ at the moment book in tune ft to 22 to 25 says Adam fell that men might be and men are that\n\n(21:51) they might have joy so Adam fell so that men may have joy sterling W sole member of the first quorum of seventy stated in the church section of desert news July 31 65 under Christ Adam yet stands his head Adam fell but he fell in the right direction he fell towards the goal Adam fell but he fell upward Jesus says to us come up higher\n\n(22:19) Brigham Young says the devil told the truth about Godhead I do not blame mother Eve I would not have a miss eating the forbidden fruit for anything through the gift of sin humanity can achieve godhood well who is this speaking is this the devil speaking or was this Jesus Christ speaking this isn't their doctrine of\n\n(22:41) covenants he were also in the beginning with the father man was also in the beginning with God intelligence or light or truth was not created or mad neither indeed can be again you have it there Mormonism is nothing other than Freemasonry masquerading as a religion of Jesus Christ deceiving millions in the process and just being a\n\n(23:03) tool for the Jesuit Order the Catholic Mass basically says the same Oh bless it fault which does procure such a redeemer this is the figure of Christ that they have at the Mormon temple and whether Jesus looked like that or not who knows the devil says he wants to impersonate Jesus so maybe Jesus looked like that I\n\n(23:28) don't know I'll find out one day when he comes with the clouds of heaven I wonder where they did have a split beard which is a symbol of a goat but nevertheless here we have the leader Joseph Smith and if you look at the figures over here you'll see a beehive and if you go and look in the workbook to babylons you'll\n\n(23:51) see that the Beehive is a symbol of paganism this is preg and deities now this is a rather fascinating story you see the world is being controlled by our cultists and our cultists often run in families so you have occult families which control the world now some people go too far and they say you know there's a reptilian connection\n\n(24:17) and their reptile families and now let's not go there let's just say is it possible that there are families that control of the world and they come from royal families now some royal lines have been eradicated eliminated destroyed wiped off the face of the earth through Jesuit intrigue and others have been\n\n(24:44) placed in power like the House of Stuart for example in England every one of them High Masons those are all are cultists I mean the queen is the queen of the Bilderbergers how much more occult can you become that so here you have these royal families is it possible that these royal families are controlling much of\n\n(25:03) the world and that the kings of the world one day rule well let's just have a look at something interesting here is the Howland family chart which is published at the Mormon temple and tells us who's who in the zoo and who's related to this family one family so we're looking at Greg great grandpa it's\n\n(25:23) over look who he's descendants all one family you can check this out for yourself Joseph IRA a very prominent man in his old days Joseph Smith there's the founder of the Mormon movement he is part of that family comes from the same great-great-grandfather Emma Hale comes from that from it Winston Churchill he has the same\n\n(25:49) great-great great-grandfather Franklin D Roosevelt has the same great-great great-grandfather Richard Nixon has the same great-great great-grandfather do you mean to tell me that President Ford had the same great-great great-grandfather do you mean to tell me that george w bush senior had the same great-great great-grandfather a George W\n\n(26:15) Bush jr. had the same great-great great-grandfather now this is kind of strange do you really believe that though they come from different sides of the of the earth divided that they all come from the same family do you think this is pure chance I leave it to your speculation I don't want to go further\n\n(26:36) into this I just find it fascinating that they all come from the same family from Churchill to how many presidents in the United States one two three the one in between four five presidents in the United States plus those from the other side plus the founder of the Mormon movement all from the same family it's\n\n(26:58) very weird very weird and then if you go into Mormons and NASA you will find that all the top men that they were all Mormons or they were masons if you go into a mason temple you will find the photographs of the presidents and your the photographs of all the great stars that went up into the sky here is the\n\n(27:27) Scottish Rite Supreme Council northern Masonic jurisdiction calendar their own calendar from 1998 and it tells you some few interesting things anybody recognize that man Buzz Aldrin anybody recognize that one Colonel John Glenn and they tell us what they were 33 degree Freemasons so the lists are just\n\n(27:52) endless we've already discussed that every single president just about has been a freemason and you'll find them in the Masonic presidential lists so Freemasonry is also behind the New Age movement here you have their original magazine Freemason magazine which was called the New Age but because they\n\n(28:14) linked it too much to Freemasonry they changed the name to Scottish rites now so many people have said to me that I surely do not have the books I'm talking about I'm pulling it out of my thumb so I took the trouble to put them down onto my carpet and to photograph them there is Pike's book morals and Dogma there is\n\n(28:39) Blavatsky's book secret doctrines secret doctrine new encyclopedia of Freemasonry a whole host of them here is Alice a Bailey the High Priestess and prophetess of the New Age movement remember that she received messages from the Tibetan to all cool we introduced her when we spoke about Freemasonry Leviticus 1931\n\n(29:01) says do not turn to mediums and spiritists do not seek them out to be defiled by them I am the Lord your God and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment Hebrews 9 17 let's just get these voices and these verses clear when these voices come or they contrary to the verse probably yes this woman has written more\n\n(29:26) books than most other women in the last two centuries one of the most prolific writers of all times Alice a Bailey her books were published under the symbol of the lotus flower and they were published by the publishing company Lucifer publishing company which caused such a stir that they changed it to Lucis trust one of\n\n(29:51) the books problems of humanity with the Masonic signs on it reappearance of the Christ this is a preparation for the coming of Christ forgetting the things that lie behind I will strive towards my higher spiritual possibilities I dedicate myself anew to the service of the coming one and will do all I can to\n\n(30:11) prepare men's minds and hearts for that event I have no other life intention this is Alice a Bailey writing now this coming one is not Jesus Christ because she's a Luciferian who is she saying is going to come Lucifer but they call him the Christ now which other movement is waiting for the Christ to come the Mormon movement\n\n(30:35) right they're saying he will come and he will present himself in their temple there in Salt Lake City here's another movement that might interest you the Jehovah's Witnesses and there are millions and millions of Jehovah's Witnesses in the world today now the Chavez witnesses were formed by CT Russell who lived between 1850 to\n\n(31:02) 1916 he's the founder of the Jehovah's Witnesses they vehemently deny any Masonic connections but this man was a 33 degree freemason the divine plan of the ages the helping hand for Bible students here it is in the Norwegian language notice the symbol that they used on the front is the symbol of the\n\n(31:26) God raah the Sun God Roth the equivalent of the God shamash here is an original watchtower from December 1 1916 this is no longer deniable tyranny I photographed it myself and there it is the symbol that Freemasonry uses there's the Masonic symbol on it and then he describes here how the founder Russell\n\n(32:00) died here's a perfect description by his companion he it was then that he stood again and said please make me a Roman toga make me a Roman toga he was dying and he made him a Roman toga from a sheet that he put in him I did not understand what he meant but did not like to have him repeat because he was\n\n(32:21) so weak his voice had become so weak that he had to repeat nearly everything dear brother Russell I do not like to ask you to repeat anything etc etc I said brother Russell I do not understand what you mean I will show you and then he took this sheet and he took it around him and etc etc fastened them together\n\n(32:41) here this is how a high Mason wants to die when he gets to the point of death so the entire Masonic ritual the high Masonic ritual of death is here described so Russell was a high freemason a 33 degree Freemason whether we like it or whether we don't so this is an occult Society pretending to represent Jehovah Yahweh if you look at\n\n(33:13) his grave you will see that it also had the Masonic symbol in the wreaths on it and the early watchtowers also used this symbolism there it is and there it is you'll find it on the early watchtowers you need to have very old ones I got this information from a Jehovah's Witness who turned from Jehovah's\n\n(33:38) Witness this in his old age so if we look at the the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses there are the organizations that have made more predictions of prophecy than any other every single one of their prophecies is the chart of the ages every single one of them has turned up zero for example 1874 they said was the coming of Christ\n\n(34:05) he never came 1878 the resurrection they then taught that had take place but were invisible 1881 close of favor to the Gentiles probation closed 1914 Armageddon didn't come 1915 Abraham Isaac and Jacob were to be resurrected they were not resurrected 1918 Christendom and his churches would be destroyed didn't happen 1920 the\n\n(34:31) republics did not disappear as they had said 1925 the establishment of the kingdom well if this is the kingdom that can have it after 1925 people would be able to call up Abraham who would lend live in Jerusalem and have their loved ones resurrected nothing of that happened the New World Bible cannot in\n\n(34:53) 1950 before that they just crossed out the King James Bible 1975 the end of the world but it did not come not one single prediction one of the things that the Bible says about a prophet a true prophet is if his predictions do not come true then forget about it end of the Gentile times page 99 Jehovah's Witnesses concerning the times\n\n(35:18) of the Gentiles we consider it an established truth that the final end of the kingdoms of the world and of the full establishment of the kingdom of God will be accomplished by the end of ad nineteen hundred and fourteen nothing happened sometime before the end of ad 1914 the last member of the body of\n\n(35:34) Christ will be glorified did it happen no so this religion again a religion started by Freemasonry because the the idea is the more distractions you have the more likely you are to cover all the bases doesn't that make sense and what is the game of all these religions to remove the deity of Jesus Christ that's\n\n(36:04) the end of all these religions they teach for example the Jarvis witnesses that Jesus is not God he's just a created being Mormonism teaches that Freemasonry teaches that the occult world teaches that islam teaches that inside a Catholicism teaches that they all teach that somebody hates Jesus Christ can you\n\n(36:30) guess who it is it was Lucifer yes it was Lucifer and his agent the Bible says is the papacy and they're going to use the papacy to achieve its ends and I think it is high time that the world is shown the nature and the magnitude of the total onslaught against Jesus Christ as Lord Savior and only Savior on this planet this\n\n(37:07) organization over here is the baha'i organization - Israel June 2003 nearly one and a half million people have visited the garden terrace surrounding the shrine of the barb on Mount Carmel the Bob this is where he lives or where he is represented he doesn't live there of course anymore since they were first opened to the\n\n(37:34) public in falk June 2001 on Carmel they put this temple here you have the temple representation you will see all the symbols again the stars and all that goes along with it and the Baha'i faith says the fundamental unity of all religions is its main aim and well I like the Shatin says we must get them\n\n(38:01) all to accept a universal Christ that satisfies them all the independent investigation of truth the Equality of men and women the elimination of prejudice universal education establishment of international auxiliary language spiritual solutions to economic problems the harmony of science and religion\n\n(38:18) of world peace through international cooperation so powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate I hate these words I'm totally allergic to these occult words the whole world right so they want to get all the religions together under one star and that star is definitely not my god the Golden Dawn\n\n(38:41) Israel there you have the symbol of the new age part of the new age is mystic revelations the teachings of the Christ two pillars yeah team Bella's then came told us the bull Aries the RAM Buddha Shri Krishna Shankara Shiva we have the age of piscis which brought us the Christ and then eventually we will go to\n\n(39:04) the universal Christ this is New Age theology and it starts of course with yaki minbars which is the very heart and soul of Freemasonry again free race inori controls all these things the musical hair when the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars then peace will guide the planets\n\n(39:23) and love will steer the Stars which is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius how many an understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehood or division golden living dreams of vision mystical crystal revelation and the minds true liberation Aquarius Aquarius Aquarius you old people will remember\n\n(39:38) that tune one time yes what a lie everything about this is Luciferian it's the coming together in unity under occult symbols just as Freemasonry does the same thing with its yah him and Boaz symbols the Bible doesn't talk about pillars in that sense here is the patience of the saints here are the ones\n\n(40:03) who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus revelation 14:12 those are pillars that we can put our faith on I think that is the only thing so the New Age is full of amulets and cosmic keys and pyramid power and astrology natural healing hands of light it's all very easy tarek and very pleasing to the mind this\n\n(40:30) wisdom this ancient wisdom the Enochian workbook arched types of the Tree of Life by the way the Enochian workbook is of course apocryphal which Roman Catholicism teaches perfectly acceptable Tarot magic all-seeing eyes pentagrams witchcraft either good witchcraft dark witchcraft do you know that in England\n\n(40:57) you can take a degree at the University in witchcraft and the government pays for it it's nice you can become a witch and you can choose to become a dark witch you're a good witch white little witch you're a black lien which doesn't really matter once within the magic circle to which says the following word\n\n(41:14) great Masters of the Universe swiftly execute my wishes I summon you by the great names full of power of the Illuminati of the firmament this is calling Lucifer appear to me as I evoke the sacred influence of all the principalities and powers I thought we battle against them here that invite them do you come in peace\n\n(41:37) through the power of the exalted Illuminati will you serve me and reveal all things unto me of land and sea of knowledge and wisdom of good and bad of natural law and of sorcery that's what witchcraft is about can you see the language of Eden in there yes or no yes good and evil and all these things the\n\n(42:02) Bible says in Deuteronomy 1810 there shall not be found amongst you anyone that makes his son or his daughter pass through the file that uses divination or an observer of times on enchanter or witch a trauma and consultive familiar spirits a wizard or a necromancer one who speaks with the dead for all there\n\n(42:22) do these things on abomination unto the Lord and because of these abominations the LORD thy God does drive them out from before thee today the world this is what it's about this is the world voices from heaven arch types of the zodiac now let's have a look at some of these great modern Channel that communicate with the spirits the\n\n(42:44) channel Virginia scene she says Jesus speaks through her he says death is the creation of humanity not of God this is the simple truth again they teach there is no dead here is a new age book the life of death here's another one by Ann Curry you cannot die then it has the symbol of shamash over there\n\n(43:07) you cannot eyes this serpent language or God language sure it's serpent language it please yes this nine five to six for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not anything neither had there any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten also their love their hatred their Envy is now perished\n\n(43:29) neither have they any more portion forever in anything that he's done under the sun ecclesiastic 9 verse 6 when you're dead your mind ceases but not these people they talk to them living Tarot spiritualism personal alchemy the rose is a symbol of Lucifer ancient magic and the New Age they used the same\n\n(43:51) symbols they use pillars there is the half moon with a star in it or the Sun in it that's the same as the birth of the Sun God and his death and if it's in the form of the host then it's the Eucharist if you like they have the face of Apollo instead of Mary it's just the male form it's exactly the same thing so\n\n(44:13) Sun Moon stars Isis Horus sit worship another channel is JZ Knight from New York she's probably the most famous channel in the world today she talks to a spirit called aramta she has all the famous film stars as clients there she is she's a very pretty woman and this is by the way Masonic but never mind there\n\n(44:38) is a symbolism and you'll see that it's triangular and all these things Ranta channeled by JZ Knight throughout history we have tried many different avenues to remind you of your greatness your power and the forever nests of your life we have been king conqueror crucified Christ teacher friend philosopher\n\n(45:01) anything that would permit knowledge to occur at times we have intervened in your affairs to keep you from annihilating yourself so that life here would continue to provide a playground for your experiences and your evolution into joy nice remember that Mormons also teach that man sin so that we could have joy this\n\n(45:23) is Jay Z night he or she explains how she met ramped up and she said Ranta appeared to her as glittering light as someone who takes a handful of glitter and throws it into a sunray and she looked at him and he says she said to him who are you you are so beautiful and he said I am aramta I've come to\n\n(45:47) help you over the ditch we cannot become near to God and giving our power away to a concept if there was only one son of God for it begs the question and who are you alright we cannot give ourselves over to the concept that there is only one son of God because it begs the question then who are you what does that\n\n(46:13) imply that you are also God okay let's ask her now to tell us what our true faith is what is the good news the good news is the thing that the church holds blasphemous that the only way we can explain common people to be divine as if they were God and it's the one teaching they forbade anyone to have there is\n\n(46:46) only one place that God is explained and his most extraordinary and simple concept and that isn't the church it happens to be than them at the church it's called society I think comes a big lot of rock and what have you so what don't they want you to know that you are God the church does not want you to know that you are God\n\n(47:17) but the Nemesis of the church is going to be science fortunately science is going to destroy the church its science doing a good job of that very good job false science so-called amazing teachings so sometimes you have to have a little bit of help to go to the other side so they use drugs here are smart\n\n(47:43) drinks this one is called fallen angel it's sold in a packet of 100% G's no no Jesus and you can pack up your spiritual life by using ecstasy and if you have been on ecstasy and you take a smart drink a normal one whatever it is do you have Red Bull here gives you wings and all these drinks with a high caffeine\n\n(48:11) just that can trigger it again and give you another trip the New Age also teaches us how to become divine and controls our others in the business world breakthrough performance here is a young man walking over the coals which the Bible forbids which is also done in Hinduism which teaches you to become\n\n(48:32) divine and the chief results through focused attention you can look at someone and make him do whatever it is you want him to do Helen Schucman she started hearing an inaudible voice which dictated messages to her this continued seven years she wrote the Course in Miracles three startling months preceded\n\n(48:51) the actual writing so there she goes she writes the book why me because you wish to know the true me are willing to serve and have given me permission to enter your life and so the messages went on and then finally she wrote or what the spirit dictated to her Jesus Christ what's her first statement there is no\n\n(49:12) need for help to enter Heaven for you have never left can you see the total onslaught on the divinity and vicarious death of Jesus Christ and him as the only Savior this is a total onslaught and then come the various chance where you say I'm not a body I'm free why I'm still as God created me in other words this eternal life aspect the\n\n(49:38) course is the beginning and not the end and when you go through this course pain is my own idea idea it is not the thought of God I call upon God's name and my own this is blasphemy of the highest degree there is no death she writes because the son of God is like his father you know they give all these pathetic reasons it's not\n\n(49:57) even logic nothing you can do can change eternal love forget your dreams of sin and guilt but what does the Bible say it's because of sin that Jesus had to come and die for us is that right yes so if we are to forget those things because there is no death well then you can carry on as you did before Scientology\n\n(50:20) teaches you to become clear all it is is a scientific way of new age you attach yourself to e-meters lie detectors and they go into all your most personal details and eventually you end up going when you lie about something and so they clear you it's a form of confessional then you are so relieved that you float\n\n(50:44) and become God magic and the Western mind the keynote of the new world religion is divine approach draw near to him and He will draw near to you and there's a hierarchy the new world religion will be the unifying of the great divine approaches all religions coming together so if we look at the doctrine the New Age versus the Bible\n\n(51:08) the Bible says Jesus is the Son of God the New Age says Jesus is one of the Masters the Bible says you are saved by grace the New Age says you achieve godhood through works the Bible says Jesus is the only way and the New Age says the white Christ Christ consciousness within Bible says Lucifer is the devil the New Age says Lucifer's\n\n(51:26) the true Son of God the Bible says worship the new head says worship the creation Bible says man was created new age says physical man evolved spiritual man always existed the Bible said God is not part of the creation the Bible say the new ID says it is pantheism or pantheism sometimes if they want a divine Lucifer\n\n(51:49) still to appear to them gets a little bit more complicated the Bible teaches the resurrection the new age teaches reincarnation the word is truth says the Bible the new age says truth is within and the Bible says wait for the second coming and the new age says wait for matreya Bible says turned from sin new age says\n\n(52:08) there is no certain forget sir the Bible says become christ-like through sanctification the new age says discover the power within mother Teresa who was a great New Age proponent says oh I hope I am converting I don't mean what you think if coming face to face with God we accepting through our lives then we are\n\n(52:30) converting we become a better Hindu a better Muslim a better Catholic a better whatever we are what approach would I would I use well for me naturally it would be Catholic for you it might be Hindu for someone else Buddhist according to one's conscience what God is in your mind you must accept is this\n\n(52:50) biblical doctrine yes or no no this is serpent doctrine this is not biblical doctrine so a Roman Catholic priest might as well be a Buddhist and they can they are Buddhists we must merge the ethical and the practical the political and the priest that's the theme of their conferences so the run sees and the\n\n(53:13) conics these are the Catholic theologians and the Church of England Dalai Lama Muslims Jews sheiks all of them come together and at the United Nations of faith they were ready to move mountains and they rehearsed an a common ISM a ecomonic --all initiative which is called the United Nations of faith but\n\n(53:38) I'll be giving a whole lecture on this issue Buddhism again teachers divinity within how to become one with the divine and also teaches reincarnation in fact Buddhism is just a sect of Hinduism that's all it is well here is the Dalai Lama he is the present Lama of course when he dies one day they need a successor right and I\n\n(54:05) can't wait for the Lama to reincarnate in a baby and let him grow up they need a leader immediately so the next one is already incarnated there is the next Dalai Lama so the poor spirit of the Dalai Lama must be jumping constantly between these two what a ridiculous teaching and people buy this and he's\n\n(54:28) also of course a god-king this is from Time magazine the Dalai Lama debates exile God King just like the Pope is a God king who's he subject to them he's subject to the Pope because he bows down to him and the Vatican and Buddhism or one in the same a path to Nirvana emptying yourself until there is nothing\n\n(54:51) left of you paradise promised light out of the East and suddenly the world is flooded with these perverse little God men here they are here's one of them Rashidah avatar adidas a mirage he's God by the way here is he only has hordes of women floating around him and areas for adopt in 1993 here he enters a room\n\n(55:20) everybody falls flat suddenly the door at the front of the communion all opened the most exquisite bright being I had ever seen entered this was the one capital I had been waiting for what does he say he said it is not enough to pursue realization as a relief from suffering realization must be that which certainly is not suffering\n\n(55:43) I am the avatar of brightness the way of Adi dam is not about seeking to be relieved of suffering it is about happiness it is about being in love with me Oh the condition of taking refuge in me or obliged to fall in love with me I don't want to fall in love with that fat little guy do you anyway it's not be\n\n(56:09) derogatory some people really believe that he's God this year is Amrita Amanda my Yama a miser nickname now you think these people are just minor little figures walking around oh no these are the dignitaries of the United Nations here she receives the award on the occasion of the Global Peace Initiative\n\n(56:31) of women religious and spiritual leaders in Geneva and she's the spokesman at the United Nations but you can't worship her she's God you can worship her that's fine I'm as UN address there is one truth that shines through all creation rivers and mountains plants and animals the Sun Moon and stars you and I what is that\n\n(56:53) what's it called pantheism that's correct all are expressions of this one reality it is by assimilating the truth in our lives and thus gaining a deeper understanding that we discover the inherent beauty beauty in this diversity when we work together as a global family not nearly belonging to a particular\n\n(57:11) race or religion nation peace and happiness will once again prevail blah blah blah blah tears division conflict will go away it all sounds so nice that's what the world wants to hear there's no biblical certainly not this was the avatar me hey Baba what do you notice about their name's Bob Bob Bob Bob what does that mean you remember\n\n(57:34) gates gates Bob al gate 2l God Babel this is Babylon in the making the Dalai Lama is a god man this man is the founder of the Hari Krishna movement he calls himself that his divine grace isn't that nice I always have trouble with his name Bucky Devon Tata Swami Prabhupada whatever and there are some of these\n\n(58:06) temples you can go in there there he sits enshrined in every temple in the world and these poor hari krishna kids run around with their shaven heads and their music in their flowers and worship this little god man over here and in all their paintings you'll find 12 around 112 around 1 here you have 12 Vestal\n\n(58:30) Virgins around the one Satan wants to copy Jesus in everything doesn't he Jesus had 12 disciples around 1 there were twelve tribes of U of Israel around the Ave Satan is just a lousy copy of the original and he'll never get any better than being a lousy copy well if you want to become a Hari Krishna you\n\n(58:54) have to be poor unless you're George Harrison or one of the Beatles or one of that then you can be rich I need your money too you see well here was the original Sai Baba but he died but relax he is reincarnated you can have him back here is Swami Deandra all the the presidents the high officials of India\n\n(59:19) they in Indira Gandhi this was her personal guru he was more like a like a whatever bodybuilding God and then his holiness Maharaja my yogi what this holiness has to say is so unholy I'll put it on the screen in a later lecture he has nothing but murder in his mind social service observed to the United\n\n(59:47) Nations Day there is the Baha'i faith the bahÃ¡'Ã­ faith has the largest representation in the United Nations eight hundred full-time members that's the largest of all the churches in the world who controls them behind the scene is of course another story well here is the founder I find it so fascinating\n\n(1:00:06) that the by fiber faith was founded in 1844 you know this date keeps cropping up it's such a fascinating day and this year is the Baja ooh Allah linking the faith with the Baha'i faith founded by the Bob meaning the gates there you go yeah we have all these gates leading to heaven and there is his son now this is\n\n(1:00:31) fortunately the reincarnation of the Bob the original Sai Baba and so we have three satai Sai Baba ashram puta farty and he calls himself Almighty God this one particularly irritates me so I really have to control myself and here he appears with his little flower and he comes along with a gold car and he is at\n\n(1:00:59) the shrine where he has all the major religions coming together there have been so many issues around this man that are well it's just disgusting let's not even talk about him but this man is God and all over the world people worship Him there's a German fellow kneeling in front or sitting in front of a shrine of\n\n(1:01:27) Sai Baba well who controls these religions look at this Jesuit Swami's the Swami's many of them are nothing under but Jesuits here are Jesuit Swami's I dropped that the dressed diet and customs of the local lingo yachts and Belgium just districts and there they are as Swami's there they are as Jesuits the\n\n(1:01:51) Jesuits because in the Jesuit religion you become all things to all men and you control everything behind the scene this one over here he recently died he was bhagwan shree rajneesh or sure there is a God man and people worshipped him he had 50 Rolls Royces and the crowds went crazy over him just listen to what they\n\n(1:02:15) have to say about these people I just met but one and there it was it's nobody else than here iguanas one master and I love him I'm a moccasin let's go anything I can say rolls-royce's two or three times a day and is worshipped literally adored by his thousands of Western followers it is so saddening to see their devotion\n\n(1:02:46) for a mere human being who considers himself God and their submission to his spiritual rules like wearing his picture around their neck continually or wearing various shades of red always or changing their names to Indian one no one in his right mind would not know that this is a walking talking living\n\n(1:03:13) guru the guru is all-important the Guru is his Lord his master his Savior even greater than God I was really interested in their worship and their veneration and their adoration and the gifts and offerings they brought to me but I was certainly not interested in their problems and their difficulties\n\n(1:03:36) and hardships and pains the guru followers believe that he returns this incredible love that they feel towards him but in reality he feeds off their emotions to maintain the dainty to are seeking the wisdom the love that Pavan has to offer we have so much love and he gives us loud to everybody and it helps\n\n(1:04:00) us to to find our love in ourself thousands of seekers most of them from broken or unstable families and already emotionally wounded are becoming victims of the Guru's most of the Guru's that I know of in the West are super rich gurus are more interested in white disciples than an Indian disciples largely because they get more money from\n\n(1:04:28) the rights they have acquired vast land holdings armed bodyguards and outrageous luxuries from posh hotels to their own fleets of planes helicopters and as in Raj Nisha's case well I don't know whether you got that but can you see the magnitude how these people worship these that's just one of them besides all the\n\n(1:04:59) others can while they're a new-age psychologist says the Great Goddess Kali of India when viewed in our highest form as the wife of Shiva is a perfect example of the assimilation of the Great Mother image into new and higher corpus of Great Goddess mythology which serves as actual sacrifice in awareness not\n\n(1:05:21) substitute sacrifice in blood they hate Jesus they hate him the fall was an evolutionary advance perfect growth isn't that interesting yes what else do they say by eating from the tree of knowledge not only did men and women realize they are already mortal and finite-state they realized they had to leave Eden subconscious and begin the\n\n(1:05:45) actual life of true self they did not get thrown out of the Garden of Eden they grew up and walked out insulin incidentally for this courageous act we have to thank Eve not blame her that's the same teaching as the moment teaching exactly the same this book here is the coming of the Cosmic Christ no author is\n\n(1:06:04) Matthew Fox who's Matthew Fox a Roman Catholic priest who has become an Episcopal priest it's interchangeable it's exactly the same thing this book is about the sacred now response to the river to it reverence the sacred water the sacred everything sacred creation stars galaxies whales soil what's that\n\n(1:06:22) pantheism what else does he say what creature dare deny that it is immortal diamond an original blessing an image of the divine one it is my experience that only the human species dared to deny its divinity dares to deny the Cosmic Christ Sandra ville is a Roman Catholic priest if my thesis is corrected it is time to move from the\n\n(1:06:45) quest for the historical Jesus to the quest for the Cosmic Christ this would help to defuse the distorted religion and pseudo mystical movement of our time popularly known as fundamentalism and also called Cristo fascism well who else said that these people are the new fascists this isn't that interesting so\n\n(1:07:07) those that believe the Bible or Cristo fascists and if you believe in this Cosmic Christ then you are fine he says perhaps we need a new a command console will be forthcoming this one would be deeply echo manacle and would call forth the wisdom of all the world's religions now don't think Matthew Fox is a small\n\n(1:07:27) fry he's one of the great thinkers in the movement and what will this Cosmic Christ do what will he make people make us change cultural change our ways will lead us to deep sexuality hello this is interesting and what else will he do the Eucharist there is a promise of mateen maternal eros in this this is the old\n\n(1:07:49) sex cult of Isis it's sick the one of the main features of the New Age movement is to prepare the world for the coming of the Cosmic Christ the reappearance of the Christ and of course the mind must be attuned to a Copts ism that's where Harry Potter and all these things come in notice the hand signs of\n\n(1:08:13) Mary grand-prix she's the artist who paints for the movies and who also painted the set for the ant and all of that JK Rowling is the authoress do you know that the names used in there are actual names of demons real names and that they uses the sublime method of contamination scrambling of words for\n\n(1:08:37) example or one of their characters is called voix blithely instead of lavit scheme so this is occultism at its highest level and we are told that this has values this has nothing but satanic values when most quoted supporters of the Potter books is Christianity today that was Billy Graham's magazine and they say\n\n(1:09:01) Harry and his friends developed courage loyalty and willingness to sacrifice for one another not bad lessons in a self-centered world but they have the symbol of Zeus on them well what is the new I'd wants to do it wants to alter the state of consciousness bring in dreams and visions astrology divination spiritism\n\n(1:09:18) magic spells are called charm solstice human sacrifice is sacred six and serpent worship that's basically for what they want and how will they go about it presented in a more palatable form dismantle as students previous beliefs blend new beliefs redefine words rewrite history provide mystical experiences immerse students in enticing\n\n(1:09:41) forms of new belief used target beliefs to answer questions and demand purity as long as you demand purity everything's fine the great initiates this is what they supposedly looked like the master Moriah the Venetian master the great nine ones that came again the master illyrian the master sent Paul supposedly\n\n(1:10:01) one of the reincarnations sir abscess which means Seraphim and gellick form maho-chan and then the master Jesus which of course was overshadowed by the Christ pathetic all the other masters are masters in their own right but when it comes to Jesus he's overshadow isn't it interesting how they changed the Bible\n\n(1:10:23) to say instead of the spirit the spirit of Jesus showing that Jesus in the Bible was also controlled by someone else well and then the great master Koth whom he loved sing and then the materia the one that everyone is waiting for the Christ the Bodhisattva the in man Mahdi the Sri Krishna the son Patrick and the\n\n(1:10:44) world teacher now he is agent or channel in the world today is Benjamin cream and Benjamin cream is a British artist and longtime student of esoteric philosophy has become the principal source of information about the emergence of matreya born in Glasgow 1922 benjamin cream began studying art at an early age\n\n(1:11:04) and he became a camp painter and modernist style his webpage if you like is very very interesting share international is the name and of course it has many many links to what Catholic sites this is just another Jesuit as far as I'm concerned Benjamin creamer reappearance of the Christ and the modern masters of wisdom\n\n(1:11:27) 1982 his Torah Center organization took a full-page advertised advertisement and said Christ is now here and he says revitalize Christian churches as well as Masonic lodges will be used for purposes of giving maths planetary initiation so the churches will work together share with your brothers this joyful\n\n(1:11:52) expectation and tell them what TRAI their friend their brother and teacher of old has come it's watch this video and see what he has to say you ready to see me soil to follow my thoughts my Advent is nigh the world teacher for the New Age of Aquarius Maitreya Buddha has been living in London England since 1977 the Buddha\n\n(1:12:35) 2,500 years ago made a prophecy that at this time won't come into the world another great Buddha Buddha like himself by name Maitreya who would inspire humanity to create a brilliant golden civilization based as he put on righteousness and truth and that's what my trails come to do think alms between\n\n(1:12:59) the eyebrows he's a member of the Asian community of London he lives there as an apparently ordinary man although those an hour around him know him it's a very exceptional man it was a guy here he he is he can teach through me he can he can inspire he can heal and so on so he has a kind of vehicle like a window in the\n\n(1:13:24) world through the making what he told me to get a tape recorder which I did from Gordon Drake portable and he began to give me long dictation which I repeated onto the microphone one night three months after the initial content I heard the voice of Maitreya and he said very little was very simple he said I myself\n\n(1:13:46) am coming it will be the most extraordinary evolutionary step which humanity will take we could either accept the principle of sharing or else destroy life the the tensions inherent in the discrepancy in living standards between the developed world and the third world of such as they have within them the seeds of a third world war that\n\n(1:14:12) would be nuclear and would destroy our life human and subhuman but we have to make the choice we have to invite him we have to invite them forward on to come on to the radio and television networks of the world and on the day of declaration it will be the most extraordinary experience for Humanity we\n\n(1:14:30) will see his face on the television screens whenever you have access to television but he won't speak he won't say anything but he stops his ideas will enter telepathically into the minds of all humanity he will come into mental telepathic contact was a whole of humanity simultaneously see the light\n\n(1:14:53) which that comes you into the future some

Peter in Rome this event is now imminent then he said in 1979 the decease of Pope Paul the sixth and the southern death of Pope John Paul one month of as month later as pontiff makes it more

liveth it doesn't like the\n\n(1:17:27) Bible that's for sure he says I asked you to accept this new level of understanding if you cling to every phrase of the Bible and argue its interpretation you missed the point of God's message think of this force the force be with you he talks about the facts of the Christ the facts of the hierarchy very tight time schedule time\n\n(1:17:48) between now and the reappearance of the Christ this short learn the great invocation you know Satan is saying I'm coming soon but when we say Jesus says I'm coming soon then the world says what oh no not for a long

  "# Title:224_that_all_may_be_one_total_onslaught_by_prof_dr_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nPapal Supremacy,Ecumenical Movement,Vatican II Changes,Redefining Christianity,Freemasonry Influence\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"That All May Be One - Total Onslaught,\" by Professor Dr. Walter Veith, critiques the ecumenical movement and the Catholic Church's role in it, particularly following Vatican II. Veith argues that while the Vatican presents an image of unity with Protestant churches, it fundamentally maintains that salvation is fully obtained only through the Catholic Church and the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome. The lecture highlights the increasing acceptance of the Pope's authority among various Protestant denominations and the growing influence of charismatic and New Age spiritual practices within these churches, often at the expense of traditional biblical teachings. Veith further asserts that prominent Christian leaders, including Billy Graham and Robert Schuller, have embraced a man-centered theology and Masonic principles that deviate from core Christian doctrines, ultimately leading to a global religious unity that he views as an \"onslaught\" against the true teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 224 That All May Be One - Total Onslaught by Prof. Dr. Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWzmHsfcPiw\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] the title of this lecture is that all may be won and we have delts in the last few lectures with the political aspects and tonight I want to start with the religious aspects the Vatican 2 meetings American to the Pope is being carried in during that meeting and at that meeting it was decided that the churches the\n\n(01:31) Protestant churches may remain in their confessions and obtain salvation provided of course that they accept and acknowledge the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome now after Vatican - it was caller onna the Jesuit strange how they keep popping up I know I'm saying this frequently but it's just the fact he was the one who\n\n(01:58) was commissioned to take this message to the world that everyone could remain in their confession provided they acknowledge the supremacy of the Bishop of Rome and I've already dealt with this but I'm gonna go into a little bit more detail now Paul netter who was held the position at Xavier University Cincinnati\n\n(02:21) where's professor of theology he studied on the karana and he wrote this book no other names and in this book no other name he writes certain interesting things he has a commentary on it it's interesting that they have this little humanist man over there on the book tells us it's humanism he right faces the conundrum of\n\n(02:49) what the committed Christian believer does theologically in the face of growing evidence scholarly and from personal encounter that there are other ways religious ways of leading a full authentic human life than the Christian Way are you beginning to see something can a person be saved definition that is come to live a truly human life\n\n(03:13) by some other name than that of Jesus Christ hello let me just recap there to be saved means to live a truly human life is that correct theology this is a professor of theology and this book is prescribed in virtually all seminaries of theology in the entire world natha's answer is one can be saved by\n\n(03:37) some other name and then he proceeds to show how this affirmation can be squared theologically with full Christian commitment this is first-rate creative theology that's the only sentence I agree with it is creative theology but it's definitely not biblical theology well at the second ecumenical council if\n\n(04:02) the Bible is not going to be the norm we'll have to replace it with something else and it was decided in document 5 1/5 of page 5 1/5 of the ecumenical documents that were written at Vatican 2 documents the unity of all Christians may at last be restored to shine forth for all peoples are called to be a\n\n(04:23) single new people confessing one Jesus Savior and Lord professing one faith celebrating one Eucharistic mystery there are lots of problems were there in this particular one particularly the Eucharistic mystery all Christians should be of an ecumenical mind document Vatican 2 page 5 1 5 the Catholic catechism will tell us that Vatican 2\n\n(04:46) did not change the doctrines it only appeared to 10 change the doctrines this is the present catechism of the Catholic Church article 8 1 6 the soul Church of Christ which our Savior his resurrection entrusted to Peter's pastoral care commissioning him and other parcels to extend his rule this church church\n\n(05:06) constituted an organized society in the present world subsists in the Catholic Church the Second Vatican Council decree on a common ISM explains for it is through Christ's Catholic Church alone which is the universal help towards salvation that the full of the means of salvation can be obtained there's been a change in\n\n(05:27) doctrine only Protestant believe that there has been a change of doctrine wounds of unity article 8 1 7 where there are sins there are also divisions schisms and heresies so if there was a division then it was sin so who's the sinner the one who separated towards unity Christ bestowed unity on his church from the beginning and this is\n\n(05:58) something the church can never lose 820 it didn't change it still governs the rules the church through its Supreme Pontiff and bishops everybody will have to acknowledge this that's why priests Jo Connell says the final object of ecumenism as Catholics conceive it is unity in the faith worship and the\n\n(06:20) acknowledgment of the supreme spiritual authority of the Bishop of Rome that's the bottom line the church bond of non-christian religions all nations form but one community they want the same relations with Muslims with all the other religions let's make sure that this is true this was the Catechism it\n\n(06:41) can't be wrong further questions answered Bonaventure henwood Vatican to teachers in several places that the Catholic Church and it alone is the church founded by Jesus Christ no change in the Vatican to documentation then September 5 2000 the Vatican made this quite clear the churches examined the Vatican statement 36-page statement said\n\n(07:05) other Christian communities such as Anglicans and other Protestants are not churches in the proper sense Canon David Oliver ministers and Thomas Anglican Church says or well okay whatever other churches are not sis no sisters of ours the Vatican insists and remember that Karl Rahner said must always be clear\n\n(07:26) that the one Holy Catholic and apostolic universal Church is not the sister but the mother of all the churches so that's the latest statement definitive statement from the highest sources in the Vatican vatican ii changed nothing these are some of the comments of the other churches churches are stunned by Pope's\n\n(07:44) attack protestant churches expressed disappointment etc but nothing changed they were still in their communica movement the washington post has said a new vatican dictum is to today declares that individuals can tell obtain full salvation from earthly sin only through the spiritual grace of the catholic\n\n(08:04) church there you go and that other faiths including Protestant Christian ones have defects they place their followers in gravely deficient situations and that includes Muslims Hindus Jews everyone they have to accept Catholicism as leader that's what the Vatican teachers now how are you going to do this\n\n(08:25) if the Bible so clearly condemns Catholicism well Vatican and The Sunday again the documents Vatican to any endeavor must be made to make Sunday a genuine day of joy and worship we must celebrate the Paschal mystery it must be the primordial feast day they must be freedom from work shall not have precedence of a Sunday all feasts are\n\n(08:50) important then it says the supreme manifestation of this is the sunday assembly so again very can to really tit that Sunday was the day it was to be kept and they call it the Lord's Day and in their catechism article 2 174 they admit that we all gather on the day of the Sun for it is the first day after\n\n(09:13) the Jewish Sabbath there's no such thing as a Jewish Sabbath the Sabbath was instituted in Eden long before there was a Jew now Sunday in Christ Passover Sunday fulfills the spiritual truth of the Jewish Sabbath and announces man eternal rest from God and it comes from tradition this all stands in their\n\n(09:34) catechism I'm not going to go into the detail so now if you're not going to have the Bible as basis then you better give the people something else musical celebration this is page 83 American documents actively participate more where format of the celebration and degree of participation should be varied as much\n\n(09:54) as possible the liturgy now the liturgy is everything that happens in a church beside the sermon it marvelously increases the church's power to preach Christ so now let's put more emphasis on the liturgy and less emphasis on the what the preaching and I even call it in some documents the holy liturgy a sign\n\n(10:20) lifted up amongst the nations and to gather the children that are scattered until there is one fold one shepherd of course there has to be the Pope how are we going to do this this is Vatican 2 their documentation document very adamant to quote in all popular devotions the Psalms will be especially useful and also works of sacred music\n\n(10:41) drawn from both old and more recent heritage of sacred music popular religious songs organ other instruments characteristics of a particular people the participation and celebration should be internal but must also be external internal participation Potter's participation by gestures and bodily attitudes acclamations responses and\n\n(11:04) singing in other words Vatican 2 says let's make the service Lively let's start moving let's have some bodily attitudes let's shake the arms you know then it's not so important whether you have your Bible in fact it's hard to hold the Bible if your arms are swinging around like cartwheels how much the\n\n(11:26) songs be let's go again to the Catechism article 1 1 5 7 song and music fulfill their function their signs in a manner all the more significant that's fine there's nothing wrong with singing singing must be beautiful into the glory of God but they said that music must be emotional quote Vatican Catechism how I\n\n(11:45) waked deeply moved by your hymns songs and voices that echoed through your church what emotion I experienced sounds that float in my ears distilling the truth in my heart a feeling of devotion surged within me tears streaming down my face tears did me good so the more tears and the more emotion the better switch the mind\n\n(12:05) off and switch on something else and so the papacy started using rock groups and the Pope started singing to ABBA music and all this sort of stuff started coming into the churches which was unknown before this is the Pope's personal little rock band that goes with him sometimes when he travels these days\n\n(12:25) they've advanced to the more metal groups and all of those and by 1967 the faculty and students of the Catholic the case-mate University started becoming charismatic by 1968 the World Council of Churches had Catholics as observers by 1975 they were observers in nairobi by 1975 a mass mass gathering took place at\n\n(12:57) rome and pope paul ii actually started speaking in tongues here it is christianity today june 6 1975 bishops Archbishop's cardinals struggling to keep their hats in place sang and danced in ecstasy embracing one another raising their arms to heaven and Pope Paul the sixth address was punctuated with ecstatics so he started\n\n(13:23) speaking in tongues great example for the church the Lutheran Church by 1974 the u.s. lutheran roman catholic dialog published papal primacy in the universal church they were beginning to play with the idea that Rome would again be the head of the churches the Presbyterians Congregationalists Methodists followed\n\n(13:47) column Buckhannon writes the emergence of the Church of Rome as a partner in eco medical discussions and the impact of the charismatic movement totally changed the communica relationship so this new spirit makes the talk between the various opposing factions more and more possible by 1975 there was a common\n\n(14:08) catechism where the moral director the Decalogue were questions where many passengers in the New Testament were put in the mouth of Jesus things that the historical Jesus never uttered the physical resurrection is a problem full of difficulties etc etc starting to question the Bible by 1977 there was a\n\n(14:31) joint Drummond Catholic Commission which issued together with the Anglican Church this statement it seems appropriate that in any future union universal primacy Church has been described shall be held by the Roman sea so the Anglican Church said okay Pope shall be held by 1989 the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury the\n\n(14:51) Reverend Robert Runcie went to Rome and urged Christians to consider the primacy of the Pope a better together there they are and then came the final famous signing of the document where they actually signed their is the signing the Pope and Runcie signed the Declaration at Canterbury and the Pope is now the\n\n(15:12) head of these churches and some nice Masonic signals yes they're going to be together and the Queen well she and her entourage visit the Pope and say well what it Prince Charles say I do not want to longer be the protector of the faith but just protector of faith so Protestantism goes and of course much marching in the\n\n(15:43) streets of the United Kingdom the next [Music] Archbishop of Canterbury is carry and carry is remarkable because of his charismatic renewal and speaking in tongues so the Anglican Church the first to go Rome would bound now this is the famous and Paul's Cathedral there it is London bus I photograph this myself and this is\n\n(16:10) a stunning picture what do you see what does it look like it looks like a miniature of the Vatican yes in fact it is a replica of the Vatican and the very amazing thing is that some Paul's Cathedral never looked like that never looked like that in fact it used to look like that but now it has been totally rebuilt and it now looks like\n\n(16:37) that doesn't a sound remarkably like an image of the beast an image of the Beast well let's go inside you have to be very sneaky with your camera when you go in there and this is what it looks like now there's the main altar Wow all the main altar is an exact copy of paninis canopy in Rome that means the protestant church\n\n(17:03) here has copied wrong very interesting there are the black and white squares they have Cupid's with other angelic beings male females etc and if you look at the ceiling and you photograph the top you will find beautiful Masonic symbols this is masonry this is not Church of England so the Church of England has\n\n(17:26) capitulated and has become part of masonry and therefore we could say Luciferian sad but true well in front of the main altar you have the typical solar symbols looking from the top it's like a witch's Cove it's been restructured this is our cultism in fact it even has the black and white pentagram on the floor and on the floor\n\n(17:52) it has the symbol of the serpent with a tail in the mouth representing the Sun and the moon by the way those are my shoes they were nice and clean and the solar deities on the floor so this is nothing other than Catholicism here are symbols of new-age these are the peacock symbols of Lucifer the triangles in the\n\n(18:14) in the circle of the hexagrams and of course the corpses under the altar and IH s on there and Sun blazes on their utilities also the mythical Pelican North bird feeding its young to its flesh these are occult symbols now what john paul ii could write in crossing the threshold of hope that by the year 2000\n\n(18:43) we need to be more united for unity all churches must accept papal authority the pope said in 1995 that's the condition of unity now why did the Reformation split from Rome surely the Reformation had good reasons biblical reasons revelation 13 verse 8 said and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not\n\n(19:09) written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundations of the world well they have surely corrupted that one in the modern translations but never mind that's what it says they shall not be written in the book of life if they worship the system by obeying it here is their dorm to Berlin this is the\n\n(19:32) Lutheran Mother Church if you like in Germany and there they have huge pictures of Mary with candles burning in front of it there yeah but this is back to Rome and the vet bill published the picture of Martin Luther shaking hands with the Pope well in the 1990s the Pope went to Mainz Germany and he said it communism is an\n\n(19:58) urgent task and then Christians forging towards the new era churches have a pact and then the famous Synod in Germany the Lutheran Synod hi sighs indict except for these old bones of contention if you like and they decided their Pop's honest mere anti-christian ant vet the Pope will no longer be called Antichrist well\n\n(20:24) that's the end of the Reformation as far as Lutheran is concerned Time magazine then picked it up and said a half millennium rift Lutheran's and Catholics reach agreement on the issues that once split Western Christianity into and by 1999 of ember first churches end 500 year rift so the Lutheran's acknowledged the Pope\n\n(20:50) and this amazing statement Germany calls to ask forgive Luther for what for what should he be forgiven and the Calvinistic Church they said we need to have more respect for the icons and the things we cannot just go together like this Luther leader says Pope might be global spokesperson for all Christians\n\n(21:16) Friday Church news notes July 6 2001 Ishmael narco general secretary of the Lutheran world fell off said in March that Lutheran's can certainly look to the Pope as one of the spiritual leaders in the world today he went on to say that the echo Medical movement requires Christians to look into the possibility that the Pope\n\n(21:35) should become the global spokesperson for all Christians so the Anglicans capitulate the Lutheran's capitulate the Presbyterians capitulate the Methodists capitulate everybody capitulates in Germany you have now churches such as this one which I find interesting there's the Catholic side there's the\n\n(21:55) Protestant side and they share the belltower and by the year 2000 the Knights of Columbus which of course is Jesuit controlled started sending icons of Our Lady of Guadalupe to all the churches in the world Nativity of the Blessed Virgin it's wonderful says Gino Masotti grant knight of the Knights Columbus Council one one\n\n(22:21) six oh six at the Precious Blood Cathedral that he hopes everybody boughs down to the icon then came the joint declaration of Lutheran's and Catholics where they discussed the doctrine of justification a brilliantly written document which totally undermines the Protestant principle well if the Bible\n\n(22:41) goes you better get livelier so that the people don't read the Bible so much theologians role in Lebanon D Govardhan theologians want to become livelier let's go to church to have you know some liturgy some movement oh no no you know you swing your arms maybe you can switch the aircon dish what aim of it all is but churches\n\n(23:06) forged together recent years many leaders of national churches have moved from a no comment to the view that the charismatic movement is the best hope of renewal professor Holland Berger said exactly the same thing said Catholics Protestants come together because of the charismatic movement which has worked\n\n(23:25) miracles charismatic wave of unity amongst SA churches then the Dutch Reformed Church says the time is more than ripe to look at what we have in common and not what separates us and all these great people say exactly the same thing the moderators of all these great churches by 1990s the one Council of\n\n(23:49) Churches was not the same as it used to be originally the World Council of Churches was there to talk about Protestant unity but of course it had an agenda to be led towards Rome why is Rome not a member of the ecumenical movement because it never separated it's the mother it's the the kiddies that might come together to go back to mommy\n\n(24:14) that's what's gonna happen if Rome became a member of the command achill movement she would say that she's one of the sisters she's not she's the mother so she cannot be and at the World Council of Churches they said here come Holy Spirit renew the whole creation was the overall theme now the lady who was\n\n(24:35) in charge of the main speech in the beginning was Miss Chunkin as she burns the list of the dead she invoked well she gave the address she is now professor at UTSA and she arrived on the stage dancing with Aboriginal men in loincloths and etc and then she invoked the day she called up Hagar Uriah the\n\n(24:59) male babies killed by Herod Joan of Arc people killed in the gas chambers mart-mart Gandhi Steve Biko Martin Luther King and finally she also called up the spirit of our Liberator Jesus Christ very nice and then she burnt the list as a simple now let's look at what happens here combining combining verbal\n\n(25:22) fireworks with the performance by Korean and Aboriginal dancers chung rendered a dramatic Eve occasion of a female holy spirit she linked it to Hagar exploited and abandoned by Abram and Sarah I also know that I no longer believe in an omnipotent macho warrior God who rescues all good guys and punishes or bad guys\n\n(25:42) 18 times Chung summoned the spirits of the dead who have suffered injustice and claimed that without hearing the cries of these spirits we cannot hear the voice of the holy spirit don't bother the spirit by calling her all the time at a tone I hope the presence of all our ancestors spirits here with us shall not\n\n(26:03) make you uncomfortable well is this biblical yes or no definitely not but she is the minister of the biggest Protestant Church in Korea and she is now also professor at UTSA chunko chunko was a graduate of the Union Theological Seminary which I've already told you is my sonic Chung Hua's professor of\n\n(26:31) Korea's Iowa Woman's University the world's largest university for women with 220 thousand students she said the three goddesses I want to share with you are Carly Hindu Quan in Buddhist and nr Philippines my new Trinity interesting she added the Christian Church has been very patriarchal that's why we are here\n\n(26:50) together in order to destroy this patriarchal idolatry of Christianity okay so that's the main spokesman at most of the World Council of Churches meetings she explains I came from shamaness Buddhist and Confucius and tallest and Christian tradition when I look at our history of religion we have more than 5,000 years of shamanism more\n\n(27:14) than 2,000 years of Taoism almost 2,000 years of Buddhism 700 years of Confucianism and hundred years of Protestantism in Korea therefore whenever I go to the temples I look to Buddha I feel so young Buddha died is in his in his 80s Jesus died when he was 33 maybe Jesus should be called too young to\n\n(27:39) understand well I feel like my bow my bow is shamaness my heart is Buddhist my right brain is confusion as to my left brain is Christian Kim continued I call it a family of gods and they are together so do you see the direction in which the World Council of Churches is moving King also said we believe that\n\n(28:05) this life-giving energy came from God and he's everywhere it is in the Sun in the oh here we go again how nauseating what is this pantheism it is from the ground and it isn't from the trees if you feel very tired and you feel you don't have any energy to give what you do sit in silence maybe you go to a big\n\n(28:24) tree and ask give me some of your life energy or you ask the Sun to give you some life energy well is this Christianity yes or no no this is absolutely not Christianity Chun was also a speaker at the World Council of Churches in Harare Zimbabwe in November 1998 where she performed the central dance dr. King declared that to witness\n\n(28:46) about Jesus Christ to another person is in reality an act of violence now let's get to the hub of the matter to witness about Jesus Christ is an act of violence why because you are doing what you are going against the human rights of the other individual who might be a Buddhist or a Hindu or this or that he has the\n\n(29:09) right to be what he is and if you tell him something else that you have to believe in Jesus Christ then you are committing an act of violence so in other words what I'm doing is an act of violence okay when reminded that Jesus said in John 14:6 that he is the only way King said Jesus was mistaken oh yeah\n\n(29:32) that's why the World Council of Churches uses demons and all kinds of interesting things and we have a camina camina now what does it come in a mean yeah we have an example of a Kamino well let's ask the World Council of Churches webpage what I kameena actually means the world a communica is derived from the Greek team term or a\n\n(30:00) commoner which may be translated as the whole inhabited world it is in seeing this world as gods that we see ourselves as one it is in seeing all the world's people as made in God's image that we are called to protect the welfare of everyone interesting now remember that I always show you that Gary Carr said the\n\n(30:24) ancient Babylonian religion through cable ISM etcetera through to Freemasonry controls Marxism the American secret political sciences the international banking and the World Council of Churches do you think he might have been right with their teaching Jesus was wrong he wasn't young he was too young to understand we have\n\n(30:47) nature worship all of these things that is definitely not biblical what does Allah say Bailey the founders of Lucifer trust predict in 1919 she predicted the appearance of a universal church of which the definitive outline will appear towards the end of the century there will not be any dissociation between the universal\n\n(31:11) church the sacred lodge of all true masons you know they're bringing it together and the inner circle of the esoteric societies in this way the goals and work of the United Nations will be solidified and a new church of God led by all the religions and by all of the spiritual groups shall put an end to the\n\n(31:32) great hennessy of separateness good this requires a whole lecture this is heavy stuff so there's a lecture coming the UN and the occult agenda it's on your paper this is very heavy she says the churches the lodges sacred Lud's by the way and the easier tarik societies by the end of the century will work together to bring\n\n(31:56) about this new world religion now as a Christian believing that Jesus is the only way can I join the society yes or no they're all so adamant this is very strange norman vincent peale now is norman vincent peale probably one of the greatest preachers about of our times 33 degree freemason Freemasonry has always\n\n(32:23) welcomed men of all faiths and religious beliefs to enter its doors the only requirement is for good men to believe in the supreme architect and the immortality of the soul none of which is of course public Oh Masons in fact go beyond the narrow sectarianism of limiting dogma they agree with the statement of the famous statesman and\n\n(32:39) writer Edmund Burke the body of all true religion consists to be sure in obedience to the will of the sovereign of the world in a confidence in his declarations and in imitation of his perfection that's what Norman Vincent Peale Saders of 33 degree Freemason as is Bishop called Saunders 33 degree Freemason\n\n(33:00) United Methodist Church rabbi Seymour Atlas dr. James Westbury executive director and editor of The Sunday Georgia Baptist Journal is a 32 degree freemason Reverend Louie grant district superintendent United Methodist Church 33 degree Freemason driveling blah blah blah blah on and on and on and on well\n\n(33:17) Norman Wilson Peale said I have found the Scottish Rite then the symbolic Lodge has passed the belief of no one religion but our respect of all major religions of the world and Billy Graham says that norman vincent peale is his great mentor interesting he has a 33 degree mentor Billy Graham the world's\n\n(33:37) most popular Christian evangelist is was listed on webpages at the 33 degree Freemason by themselves of the much criticism they took him of all the lists Shaw who was himself a 33 degree Freemason revealed that Billy Graham was at his initiation ceremony but in his book the deception he talks about prominent evangelists who tended it so\n\n(34:05) that he could get his book published Norman Vincent Peale is a definite 33 degree Freemason X Grand Chapter of the Grand Lodge of New York this is the one that Billy Graham said is his mentor Robert Schuler 33 degree Freemason these are web page sites where you can look it up but of course there are many many\n\n(34:28) writings which confirm this so this is not the only source I'm just quoting from the sources Oral Roberts Jesse Jackson most of the early founding Mormons we know that Chavez witness we know all that Peale let's have a look at norman vincent peale endorsed the channeled messages called the jesus letters written by Jane Paul\n\n(34:50) Zahra and Annie Browne so he endorsed channeled letters the amazing holy letters were written one each day over two-year period that began on a morning in 1978 she said the letters were dictated by a non-living Spirit who identified himself through her pen as Jesus Christ there's the quote peals response he adds it little matters if\n\n(35:12) these writings came from Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus of Jane they are all the same consciousness and that consciousness is God I am part of God and Jane and Anna are part of that same God right that's what Norman Vincent Peale thought this is the mentor of Billy Graham interesting speaking of occultist Kreskin all he's doing says\n\n(35:38) Norman Vincent Peale is dramatizing what I've been preaching in my writings for years another book the dead are alive they can do and communicate with us was also promoted by Peale he got a masterpiece I hope it will be read widely ok this is the mentor of Billy Graham just remember that the book's author is Harold Sherman\n\n(36:01) a psychic and spirit medium also wrote a companion but you live after death Pope John Paul visits a Jewish synagogue in by 1986-87 he tours the u.s. meets with Protestants and Orthodox 1889 Russia opens the or to the charismatic movement and so they're all coming together in one big happy family the Southern Cross the\n\n(36:25) Catholic newspaper writes Israel's chief rabbi pays a visit to the Pope the patriarch of course of the Orthodox Church and the Pope also meet with much Masonic signaling going on over there Israel invites the Pope to visit the Holy Land and the Pope honors Schindler's Widow this is the rabbi Robert Jacobs let's hear what he has to\n\n(36:50) say on this issue and in 1965 Vatican 2 changed that Jacob says the Second Vatican Council marked an historic turnaround for Catholic Jewish relations and he says john paul ii has done extraordinary things to show respect for Judaism he was the first pope to visit a synagogue no Pope in Roman history had\n\n(37:18) ever done has ever done what he has done it gives all Jews a feeling that for the first time in Christian church history Judaism is appreciated as having its own integrity and is not demeaned I think it's a tremendous privilege to meet this extraordinary Pope and then when the Pope visited st. Louis\n\n(37:48) this is what he had to say will rejoice and blossom they will blossom with abundant flowers and rejoice with joyful song that's interesting well here is Alexa the Russian patriarch and there he is with Cardinal Cassidy and they have much more freedom this is a signal picture by the way a Camino the Pope and the patriarch together and we\n\n(38:23) have a revival of Eastern Orthodoxy occultism is revived Asian religions are revived Islam Buddhism Hinduism Shintoism Shaka Gaia and spiritism in the world there is a revival of religion and religious fervour and conflict is on the increased have you noticed that yes now why because through chaos and\n\n(38:49) conflict you will bring them together make the pain of separation greater than the pain of Union thesis antithesis synthesis is the Hegelian philosophy great expectations the patriarch of Constantinople says we will join the churches then the opening of the Islamic cultural center in Rome Catholic Bishops\n\n(39:17) residing Pope John Paul greets them Islam and Catholicism we've dealt with it in a whole lecture coming together the problem is how to bring Judaism Islam Christianity all together these are documents from the Catholic Academy of trier note what they are using over here what is the symbolism they are\n\n(39:39) using with all these strange symbols on their documents same over here pentagrams all the religious symbols in a circle papal seminary or what is this structure here with the mystic towels all around it what does that mean emblem of the centenary of the Catholic Church in Cameroon well these are Collins and mandalas that they are using\n\n(40:03) these are symbols of Eastern religions symbolizing unity of all the churches Pope and the Dalai Lama together and it is interesting that we need to study what the Protestant world has to say on this issue as well and I would like to show you that the great Protestant preachers and what they are actually\n\n(40:29) preaching now Robert Schuller is listed on many many web pages as a 33 degree Freemason well the proof of the pudding of course is always in the eating he wrote here in the fourth dimension forward I discovered the reality I discovered the reality of that dynamic dimension in prayer that comes through\n\n(40:49) visualization don't try to understand it just start to enjoy it it's true it works I tried it now visualization is the way in which you start visualizing something and it becomes part of your fantasy world they train little kids to do this is an occult technique it's our cultism here is his famous Cathedral the Crystal\n\n(41:14) Palace there he is this great preacher by the way he took the plans of this Cathedral and he took them to Rome in order to have them blessed by the Pope that's very interesting that Robert Schuller's should take these to the Pope to have them bless his son is now obviously taking over and the ministry\n\n(41:36) as he gets a little bit older Robert Schuller quote from self-esteem the new Reformation he writes classical theology has earth in its insistent that theology be God centered and not man-centered that's very interesting that's spoken like a true Freemason wouldn't you agree yes on page 153 he writes one classical\n\n(42:03) role of the pulpit in Protestantism has been to preach sermons Oh which imply indoctrination more than education within this form of communication there is an inherent intrinsic inclination to intimidate manipulate and and defend the person's most prized quality of humanists his dignity well that sounds like Vatican 2\n\n(42:31) let's move to liturgy let's have all these wonderful things other than the preaching of the words he writes on page 14 sin is any act of thought that drops man myself or another human being of his or her self-esteem that's interesting because I thought the Bible said sin is transgression of the law isn't it right\n\n(42:58) he writes on page 26 27 what we need is a theology of salvation that begins and ends with the recognition of every person's hunger for glory oh I thought that justification is something that actually lays man's glory in the dust that's what I thought it makes Jesus Christ more and me less isn't that what\n\n(43:27) the Bible teaches he must increase I must decrease Wow page a 68 to be born again means that we must be changed from a negative to a positive self-image from inferiority inferiority to self-esteem from fear to love from doubt to trust very interesting theology page 75 the cross sanctified the ego trip for the cross\n\n(43:55) protected our Lord's perfect self-esteem from turning into sinful pride now that is just plain blasphemy as far as I'm concerned page 135 Christ is the ideal one for he was self-esteem incarnate I thought he came to show humility didn't he my Bible says he was humble Jesus never called the person the sinner\n\n(44:24) rather he reserved his rightful rebuke for those who used their religious authority to generate guilt and caused people to lose their ability to test and enjoy their right to dignity interesting I thought he said I have not called the righteous but sinners to repentance didn't say that so this man is obviously losing some\n\n(44:48) strange document I don't know which Bible he uses he says the church's problem is that it has a god centered theology for centuries when it needs a man centered one we're not bad merely badly informed about how good we are Oh Robert Schuller that's an a fascinating statement it would be an insult to the\n\n(45:14) integrity of any human being to call him a sinner I thought when he comes the holy spirit he will convict us sin and righteousness and judgment jesus knew his worth he success fairy's self-esteem he suffered the cross just to sanctify his self-esteem and he bore the cross to sanctify your self-esteem\n\n(45:40) the cross will sanctify the ego trip isn't this pathetic this man is not a Christian he's a Mason now remember when I say Mason I mean hi Mason because the poor lowlich blow her grades of Mason's know nothing about all of this hi Mason let me qualified Shula further amplified this latter thought on the\n\n(46:06) full dynamo show Shula said Jesus had an ego he said I if I be lifted up will draw all men unto me wow what an ego trip he was on that's disgusting questioner there's the questioner to Shula how could the cross as you write sanctify the ego trip and make us proud in the light of passages that say I hate pride in Agra arrogance\n\n(46:29) proverbs 8:13 pride goes before destruction proverbs 16:18 the Lord detests all proud proverb 16-5 do not be proud Romans 12:16 love does not boast it he's not proud 1 Corinthians 13:4 in fact Paul wants Timothy that in the last days men will be lovers of themselves 2 Timothy 3:2 good question I like the\n\n(46:50) question already why should we do anything to encourage people to become lovers of themselves if Paul in fact warned others that would be the state of godlessness in the last days Shula I hope you don't preach this because you could do a lot of damage to a lot of beautiful people if you preach that text\n\n(47:11) our man I sure hope you give it the kind of interpretation that I do or I'll tell you you'll drive them further away and they'll be madder than hell at you and they'll turn the Bible off and they'll switch you often they'll turn on the rock music and Madonna just because it's in the Bible doesn't mean you should\n\n(47:26) preach it it is big it is so difficult to preach some of those texts and not come across as lacking humility see how these people turn around Robert Schuller what sets me apart from fundamentalists is that they are trying to convert everybody to believe how they believe we know the things the major faiths can\n\n(47:48) agree on we try to focus focus on those without offending those who with different viewpoints there's the quote USA Today Shula said when we know we have been redeemed and we know we are part of God's family we are ready to dream that great divine dream of building the kingdom of God in the world now the kingdom of God I thought it was\n\n(48:11) not of this world didn't you think so as well Robert Schuller said after his thousands telecast when he was congratulated by Mother Teresa she was still alive there Billy Graham congratulate him serene Scott King Martin Luther all the living presidents of the United States as well as Sammy Davis jr. was a Satanist they\n\n(48:31) all congratulated him what we need is a positive 2 positive eyes the works that have only a negative connotation there is no greater damage that can be done than to refer to the lost sinful condition of man let me tell you something if man doesn't that he's in a lost sinful condition then he will never need a savior and\n\n(48:52) then he will be lost we don't think anything has been done in the name of Christ threatened under the banner of Christianity that has proved more destructive to human personality and hence counterproductive to the evangelism Enterprise than the often crude uncouth unchristian strategy of attempting to make people aware of their\n\n(49:11) lost and sinful condition well that's disgusting well he goes further than that let's have a look what what he really consists of the most effective mantras employ the M sound you can get the feel of it by repeating the words I am I am many times over Transcendental Meditation or TM is not a religion nor is it necessarily\n\n(49:39) anti-christian wow you can chant I am I am I am what do you think about that now you're saying I'm God surely you don't mean that mister Shula do you Methodists Anglicans all of them come together they all begin to leave believe in life after death well here in self esteem the new Reformation Robert Schuller writes to be\n\n(50:05) born again means that we must be changed from a negative to a positive self-image from inferiority to self-esteem from fear to love from doubt to trust and we can pray note to what mr. Schouler says dr. Schuler sorry our Father in Heaven II honorable is our name emphasis in the original what is Robert Schuler saying\n\n(50:30) he's saying he's God is this biblical or is it demonic theology you tell me you choose it's demonic who approves of his theology who likes his theology there it says discover your possibilities Robert Schuller positive inspirational guidelines who endorses it doctor Schuler's has an amazing ministry dr. Billy Graham birds\n\n(51:01) of a feather flock together who is Billy Graham here he is one of the greatest preacher of our time Christian winter here is with Nixon when you went into this ministry politics lost one of its potentially greatest practitioners remember that Nixon had a Jesuit speechwriter do you remember when we showed you those quotes and you know\n\n(51:29) if everybody loves you in the world well gets kind of scary here is Madison Square Gardens here he is at the US Capitol during the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal that he received with Al Gore sitting there on receiving honorary Doctrine from the Roman Catholic Belmont College bill and Graham said the gospel that found that\n\n(51:54) this College is the same gospel which I preached today hello Billy Graham I thought you were a Protestant why are you preaching Catholicism and please tell me why in all your campaigns do you have a team of 800 Catholic nuns and Jesuit priests and all kinds of people like that and why after you campaign do\n\n(52:17) you channel them to the Catholic priests to be incorporated in Catholicism why do you do that if you are a Protestant the religious news service reported on January 13 8 1981 Pope John Paul was closeted for most two hours with the Reverend Billy Graham the world's best-known Protestant evangelist religious new service there it is there\n\n(52:40) is together with him the Pope is almost an evangelist and here he is dressed in black and the purposed in white talking together it was through Billy Graham's intervention that former President Ronald Reagan set up an ambassador to the Vatican against the Constitution of the United States he has been linking\n\n(53:03) agents from the White House to Rome Graham wrote this is his own words speaking for himself Reagan was the first American President to appoint a full-time ambassador to the Vatican before he made the appointment he asked my view I told him I thought it would probably be a good thing in spite of a number of potential problems concerning\n\n(53:21) the separation of church and state and wrote an extended confidential letter outlining my reasons among other things I told him I did not think it necessarily violation of separation of church and state for whatever reason mr. Reagan went ahead with the plan later my letter was leaked to the press I caused\n\n(53:37) some consternation among my Baptist friends yes of course he would cause a consternation but his Baptist friends might not know what it is because it is so well covered up in the world if you want to read about more about him read Billy Graham and his friends Robert Schuller's 1986 possibilites magazine\n\n(53:58) had Templeton's photo on the cover the lead article quoted Templeton that nothing exists except God that is pantheism and that the Christ spirit dwells in every human being whether the person knows it or not that's universalism Templeton now who received the Templeton Prize of course Billy Graham Graham told Shula during an\n\n(54:22) interview whether they come from the Muslim world or the Buddhist world or the Christian world there are members of the body of Christ because they've been called by God yes you can't be a member of the body of Christ in any of those religions if you unknowingly do what the law requires because your conscience\n\n(54:42) dictates this and God overlooks the ignorance of those who do not know the ignorance God winked at but if you know the law and you do it not you will die if you don't know the law and you still break the law you will also die that means eternally sir evangelicals and Catholics join forces eventually and\n\n(55:07) Pope John Paul is decried as the superstar of the world Pope deserves the title of first citizen of the world Newsweek said that in 79 already after September 11 communism received a tremendous boost all the religions started coming together the Muslims and the Protestants and the Catholics they were all praying\n\n(55:32) together death of Protestantism foreseen by 1997 the Episcopal church with its bishop here had the following to say Bishop Adler is the word of the Lord told us that what we are witnessing is the end of an era that God is restoring his temple and that there would be a priesthood and it is Scott's copy that\n\n(55:56) was an apostolic concession a main difference between the Protestant faith and Catholicism now this is this church this is the basically the high Church of England in the United States but remodeler said then after the sermon he stood up to give a prophetic word but fell on the floor and wept for 45\n\n(56:17) minutes and then he said we all sensed what God was saying to us we were witnessing the end of Protestantism and then he said God's church is Catholic he declared it was classic in the beginning and it will be Catholic in the end churches agree Pope has overall authority isn't that interesting the Pope wrote this and he said in he's\n\n(56:43) crossing the threshold of hope that by the year 2000 we will need to be more united 1999 June they wrote the Pope was recognized as the overall authority in the Christian world in the Christian world entirely by an Anglican Roman Catholic Commission yesterday which described him as a gift to be received\n\n(57:06) by all the churches interesting and then he has a gift of authority the forty three page document the gift of authority has been produced by the a team member Anglican Roman Catholic International Commission and it concluded that the Bishop of Rome had a specific ministry concerning the discernment of truth what does that mean\n\n(57:26) there is infallible so the Protestant world has given up Protestantism churches should hold sÃ©ances yes who said that this was the Anglican Church in England now we're ready for spiritism in the church the churches are really falling falling these are no longer prophetic words these are false prophetic words these are false prophets\n\n(57:55) they are preaching a lie and in the next lecture it will become abundantly clear what is happening don't miss the next lecture strange fire we'll see some videos which will be astounding so he said what what this anglican priest said is that we can actually talk to the deceased and maybe we can reach the\n\n(58:20) atheists who died from the other side and convince them now that you see living there after all you don't have to be an atheist anymore if their theology was true couldn't God do it the Roman Catholic controversy James R white is a writer who says that today well are we coming together there are many reasons\n\n(58:44) why we should say separate he sees the problems the Council of Trent said to check the unbridled spirit it decrees that no one relying on his own judgement shall in matters of faith and morals pertaining to the edification of Christian doctors distorting the holy scriptures in accordance with these own\n\n(59:03) conceptions presume to interpret them country to that sense which Holy Mother Church to whom it belongs to judge of their true sense and interpretation has held and holds so only the church may tell you what to believe you oh I am you're too stupid to understand it yourself interesting the papacy has it changed\n\n(59:23) no refinement of evil where the Pope outlines that every single ancient doctrine held by Rome will be held therefore can I be part of the ecumenical movement yes or no I cannot be because I cannot accept this as my spiritual leader I have one leader and his name happens to be Jesus Christ the only lead\n\n(59:48) I had and I have one Creed and that Creed happens to be the Bible and the Bible alone that's my Creed otherwise I have no standard whatsoever keeper of the straight and narrow there's Cardinal Ratzinger german-born Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger head of the congregation of doctrine and faith they make sure that\n\n(1:00:09) every ancient Catholic doctrine remains and that no Protestant even recognizes it they're so sneaky here is Cardinal cool and these people Hanscom all they want to do is bring about a common ism so they make lots of Protestant noises didn't that Jesuit say that if you want to win someone make his noises yes or no\n\n(1:00:36) yes don't trust them one little bit by 1986 we had the Council of Assisi and all the religions of the world who were prisoned that included Islam Hinduism all these religions they all came together at Assisi there's the Pope they are the patriarchs there's run see there's the Dalai Lama Hinduism Buddhism\n\n(1:01:01) every single thing was present we're at Assisi you know what's interesting after the Council of Assisi there came an earthquake and the whole Cathedral collapsed it's almost like God said guess what they did they instantly rebuilt it to its former glory instantly immediately it stands as an icon to Assisi and that this RCC meeting\n\n(1:01:36) in 86 the first rut started of accepting the papacy as the ultimate by 1999 this is what happened the United Nations of faith moves mountains article appeared in the Belgian national newspaper lizard dated 30th August 2010 rehearse allah is talking place at the highest level in the forum we're the Supreme Being grand architect\n\n(1:02:00) that's my sonic language or watch make of the universe if he exists at all they're derogatory is to recognize his own at a time when the United Nations will shortly host the summit of the millennium with the presence of the heads of state of the entire world all the world's religious leaders have been\n\n(1:02:19) gathering in New York how much of the world's religious leaders all to discuss the most important theme of world peace and tolerance the more distant objective to create a kind of United Nations of faith where the representatives of faith and philosophies could meet in in order to discuss the future together while\n\n(1:02:42) abandoning their fatwas thesis and other terrible arms of excommunication and exclusion and relegating them to the cloakroom let's get away from our separateness let's come together this is a very noble economical initiative sponsored by whom Ted Turner at 33 degree Freemason who hates Christianity who funded the initiative he is vice\n\n(1:03:09) president of Time Warner founder of CNN and for every sin there is Christ 10 years ago the flamboyant boss of instantaneous television had declared that Christianity was nothing but an affair for losers and freaks okay so he still believes it now why would Ted Turner finance something like that because he\n\n(1:03:28) says Jane Fonda his wife turned Christian and that changed his mind I don't think so I think it's because he's a 33 degree freemason and I have an agenda well 2000 representatives of very well or less known religions the one which are participated the world over which are almost an affair of confidence\n\n(1:03:49) only known in the corridors of the UN or the spiffing Waldorf Astoria Hotel which will be used for the subsequent meetings and work the Pope said the African Cardinal Francis our scene president of the Pontifical Council for interfaith dialogue representing the Jewish faith was the Jewish rabbi law of Jerusalem\n\n(1:04:10) the Buddha two are deprived of the presence of the Dalai Lama that shows that the relivin religions never far removed from politics China threatened to boycott the meeting if he went that's just a game they're playing well the initiative Bishop Desmond Tutu said let's go ahead with it and in the US and in particular\n\n(1:04:28) in circles of the UN this first initiative has been very welcome nevertheless one needs to render to Caesar or rather to John Paul to his Jews it is indeed thanks to him that the way of reconciliation was started at Assisi in 1985 culminating in that meeting in 1986 well the Pope then may 2001 visited the famous mosque in Damascus\n\n(1:04:58) John Paul - who made history by becoming the first ever pontiff to enter a mosque and hurting Christians and Muslims to forgive each other that's the master member I showed it to the famous mosque in Damascus and we walked through it and had a look at this amazing structure with these people having the same\n\n(1:05:26) rituals as in Roman Catholicism and you will remember that we spoke about the head of John the Baptist that is stored in this mosque so it's significant that the Pope went to that particular mosque to go and seek reconciliation although reconciliation is just a word for the the outside the inside has\n\n(1:05:49) always been reconciled and we know already that the Pope then kissed the Quran so the initiative is to bring all the religions this is a symbol of the religions dancing together a symbol of Judaism and Buddhism and Christianity and Hinduism and all of them coming together in a one great big happy family\n\n(1:06:13) this is the title page of Rotarian bishop layman's document the World Peace Day and the ambulant of the world conference religions Hinduism Buddhism and finally we have a parliament of world religions now this Parliament of world religions is an outcome of the RCC meeting and this was their Africa day that the Sun\n\n(1:06:40) symbol in the middle they are interesting symbols in this so at thus interfaith meeting in 1999 as a reported Associated Press with the Dalai Lama sitting by his right side October 1999 there was another meeting in Rome the Pope presided at a special council of some 2,000 religious leaders of various\n\n(1:07:03) faiths sects and cults now I'm going to show you a video of that in a moment of what happened there the pontiff told the assembled Buddhist monks Zoroastrian priest Catholic Cardinals Hindu gurus American Indian shaman Jewish rabbis and ecumenical clergy that's all the Protestants that there are that all must\n\n(1:07:23) join in condemning who the Christian fundamentalists Wow I thought the problems were elsewhere but he obviously has an inside tact so he knows who the real problem people are it's the Christian fundamentalists why because they commit the ultimate crime of telling people about who Jesus don't you think there's a total onslaught on Jesus\n\n(1:07:51) Christ I believe there is Christian fundamentalist to abuse speech and whose efforts at converting others incite hatred and violence didn't miss to say the same thing yes or no she said the same thing at the World Council of Churches so we want a unity but please let this unity be on a universal Christ\n\n(1:08:18) just leave Jesus out of this this is an attack on Jesus Christ all present were in accord on two key points number one pope john paul ii was endorsed by consensus as the planet chief spiritual guide and overseer that's interesting and number two religious fundamentalists who refuse to go along with the global a\n\n(1:08:45) communica movement that would include me for example or to be silenced so who knows how many times you can still hear this message they must be denounced as dangerous extremists full of hate that's why we have hate laws you're not supposed to preach this message you're not supposed to preach that Jesus Christ is Lord then\n\n(1:09:11) you are a dangerous extremist full of hate well I figured I better preach it before we can no longer preach it and that's why I'm here to tell you about these things the onslaught is not against me the unsought is against the Lord and he predicted that this was going to happen well let's have a look\n\n(1:09:29) at this Masonic meeting you will see three candles in this meeting that's my sonic they liked the solar candles which are little covered candles which are used in Hinduism for example as solar candles and in Buddhism and Eastern mysticism and you will see that they use all kinds of music just like the Bible said in fact the main rock\n\n(1:09:52) band of Italy gave the background music at the ceremony on the one stage with the papacy on the other stage and every religious leader of note in the world was there of every religion to bow down and give homage to the Pope interesting let's watch it [Music] Oh on [Music] No [Music] mr. Peattie no I don't\n\n(1:11:16) [Music] it looks as smug doesn't it well here they all are Islam Hinduism Buddhism Shintoism suka gaia all of them Protestantism all of them bowing down acknowledging the Pope now didn't the Bible say that the whole world would wonder after him yes or no and that she would not suffer loss of children didn't\n\n(1:11:57) the Bible say that Judaism was they all the religions were there now this means that we are very very close to the close of time there's an interesting picture that was published once by the speaker their speaker and here you have a statue of Caesar showing a finger that's actually a Masonic thing but never mind\n\n(1:12:24) there he does it and have Mussolini on the other side and giving the finger and then they have Rome here there pops the keys under the Pope the church and the cell and they have the Pope over there in full Sun worship regalia and then they have the prostitute so much like they know something right this\n\n(1:12:48) prostitute the Bible says is the woman that rides the Beast the great prostitute that is over the nation's and all the kings of the world give their power unto the Beast we've seen that the ruling powers in the world actually come from very few families today highly occult families and the woman which thou\n\n(1:13:14) sawest is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth revelation 17 verse 8 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues Revelation 18 verse 4 what do you think they have planned for those\n\n(1:13:37) who harbor a spirit of separateness what do you think they have planned for those who say who say like the Bible says come out and be separate that you receive not her plagues and that you don't take part in her sin what do you think will be their conclusion about such a matter I think this is a very\n\n(1:14:02) very serious issue and we're gonna have lectures on this when we get there we'll see what their final plans are and who they actually pinpoint as opposition that would be interesting don't you think we'll let them speak for themselves in the meantime as for me in my house I cannot join this ecumenical\n\n(1:14:28) council and I would like to uplift Jesus Christ to you tonight as the only Savior on this world and follow the biblical way and none will be lost that is his promise why not take him at his word amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
  "# Title:225_strange_fire_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nStrange Fire,Deception at End-Time,Man-Centered Religion,Alpha Course Dangers,Obedience to God\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, \"Strange Fire,\" by Walter Veith, critically examines various contemporary Christian movements, asserting that many deviate from biblical teachings by promoting a self-centered theology over a Christ-centered one. Veith uses the biblical account of \"strange fire\" offered by Aaron's sons in Leviticus to illustrate how modern practices, such as power religion, spiritual experiences induced by hypnotic techniques (Alpha Course), and music styles that cater to personal preferences rather than reverence, represent a departure from genuine worship. He argues that influential figures within these movements, including prominent televangelists and megachurch leaders, often exhibit teachings that align with Freemasonry or occult practices, emphasizing human potential to be like God and focusing on satisfying human \"needs\" rather than fostering repentance and obedience to Christ. Veith contends that this widespread deception ultimately leads people away from the truth of the Gospel, which should be rooted in humility, unselfish love, and a desire to serve God, not self-gratification.\n\n## Content:\n(2) Total Onslaught 225 Strange Fire Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5djAvJ_fEI\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] tonight's lecture is entitled strange fire and it deals with the Holy Spirit and in the world that we are living in today the Holy Spirit seems to be very prominent in Christian worship Leviticus chapter 10 verse 1 and made up and by who the sons of Aaron took either of\n\n(02:04) them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the Lord which he commanded them not you see the Lord had kindled the fire himself and the fire is an example of his spirit dwelling amongst the people but they didn't want to take from that fire they took their own fire\n\n(02:28) and thus they were insinuating that they had the same capacity as the Holy Spirit Matthew chapter 24 verse 3 and as he said upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus\n\n(02:54) answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you so what is the greatest problem at the end of time deception deception is the greatest problem and how deceptive will Satan be so deceptive says the Bible that even the elect can be deceived that's pretty deceptive this is a major problem fire from heaven and he does\n\n(03:29) great wonders so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men revelation 1313 that means that this Protestant nation represented by the Beast out of the earth makes fire come down and thereby deceives men now does the religious world the Protestant religious world lay claim to fire from heaven yes it\n\n(03:58) does fresh fire miracle convention come and see what the Lord can do for you Lord's Jim bench press this the sin of the world this is some of the advertisements that go out inviting people to these power religious movements personally I think there's a blasphemy in that one but nevertheless but you shall receive power after the\n\n(04:33) Holy Ghost come upon you acts 1 verse 8 this power from the Holy Spirit was meant to equip the people to take the gospel to the world in other words this power was meant to serve others and not self what if we could twist this thing round and there could be more powerful self as a sign of acceptance with God would that\n\n(05:01) be the same thing as this power the Bible says if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth John 14 15 to 17 in other words it seems as if the prerequisite to receiving this spirit of\n\n(05:25) god is a spirit of obedience and a spirit of obedience implies the spirit of repentance because we were all disobedient to god and need to come in line with god's requirements once again we need to understand that it is God who cleanses us from all unrighteousness we need to understand that it is Jesus who\n\n(05:50) gives us life eternal and we need to develop a spirit of gratefulness which will induce us to keep his Commandments whereby he will empower us to preach his truth to others that was nice John chapter 3 verse 16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him\n\n(06:21) should not perish but have everlasting life can you see the centrality of the gospel the gospel is to be Christ centered it must be Christ centered and not self-centered it means submission to Christ not submission to self but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and\n\n(06:50) the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin 1 John 1 verse 7 walk in the light of Jesus today there is another form of power religion people of power convention 94 reports since the late 60s the power religion in the world has moved men mightily and literally millions of people adhere to this kind\n\n(07:23) of worship and so we find that charismatic renewal is the element of worship today the Bible says that the Holy Spirit convicts of sin and when he that's the Holy Spirit is come he will convict the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment John 16 verse 8 in other words if you truly receive the Spirit of God it will lead\n\n(07:56) you to trust only in Jesus Christ and upon his merits because you will realize that you are bankrupt you have no right to anything because we are all transgressors of God's requirements and therefore it is only by the merits of Jesus that we can be saved and the Holy Spirit will convict us of our need for\n\n(08:24) Jesus though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him Hebrews 5:8 and 9 it's no good saying I accept Jesus Christ as my savior but I'm not prepared to accept him as my king if I accept him\n\n(08:52) as my king there will be a spirit of obedience not because I have to but because I want to the beauty of true Christianity is obedience out of free will offering in Christianity we are total free agents why because Christ is 100% unselfish there is no selfishness in him and obedience is because his requirements make sense are logical and\n\n(09:33) they are an expression of his love a protection if you like a wall of protection against pain and hurt so obedience I see not ours thou shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt not but thou shalt not no no thou shalt not cause it won't even come to mind that's obedience obedience is not fear for retribution obedience is love for\n\n(10:06) his tender care and mercy that's the difference so true obedience is not something we do out of fear and the Holy Spirit strengthens us against temptation so even our good works are subject to Jesus Christ and I can only trust myself in obedience to him because of his unselfishness does that somehow make sense\n\n(10:34) he is so unselfish that he will never utilize or use my obedience as a form of submission because he's not a power monger he is gentle and meek and humble therefore any obedience that I rendered to him must be out of love and not out of compulsion or fear that's the truth of the gospel nonsense silences the Spirit of God cost\n\n(11:12) me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me Psalms 51 verse 11 if I continually to transgress God's law he will not force me because that's his nature he will not say I will force myself upon you that's the spirit of Satan that's not the Spirit of the Lord the Lord was withdrawn\n\n(11:35) he'll just withdraw keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and shall be innocent from great transgression so the Lord covers me with his love that's justification and the Lord empowers me with his love that sanctification both of them are from him\n\n(12:02) so that I have really nothing to boast and Samuel said has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams 1 Samuel 15:22 but we must not misunderstand this obedience it's very vital that we\n\n(12:27) understand obedience in the right sense but the comforter isn't that a nice name which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance so ever I have said unto you John 14:26 so besides being one who leads us in repentance to Jesus Christ he also\n\n(12:53) comforts us he also gives us hope so in Jesus there is hope and in Jesus we can be imprinted with those things which lift up and don't break down that's what the text says it's a very beautiful text the Holy Spirit thus leads us into all truth and the Bible says that Jesus is the way the truth and the life and we\n\n(13:19) are his witnesses and of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God has given to them that obey Him acts 5:32 out of love this is the right relationship wanting to do what is right and asking God to help you in this process so the Holy Spirit will bring individuals to repentance and sin guiding them in a fuller understanding\n\n(13:45) of the truth about God in Jesus Christ there are many many texts to substantiate that secondly to the fulfillment is to benefit those brought into the church by the gospel witness so it is to empower people to spread the gospel and the good news and to live the life that Jesus would have us live and\n\n(14:08) the gift of tongues for example was communicated so that the gospel could be distributed in various languages acts 2 verse 2 each one heard him in his own language they idiot the elector in his own mother tongue we see the tongues and prophecy or associated and us serve to communicate the gospel everything about\n\n(14:32) Jesus is selfless mainline blues empty churches you see in the old days they used to point to Jesus as the savior from sin and people started leaving the church but other groups started growing dramatically and so we have power churches with much growth where there is refreshing where there is something\n\n(15:01) happening and people actually see things and perceive them it all started off with the Pentecostal movement and this man David do Plessy a South African he was the first president of the charismatic world council and that's why they called him mr. Pentecost some of the symbols they used triangles and\n\n(15:23) fishes and all of these things but let me remind you once again of this little chart that we've been looking at regularly where we see that the ancient mystery religions are perpetuated through the Knights Templars Rosicrucians the papacy to Freemasonry and the Illuminati and that they according to this chart control the\n\n(15:45) world council of churches and the New Age movement we've had a whole lecture upon that and we see the various philosophies behind this let's see if we can pick up some interesting philosophies in the modern thinking of the power religion this is the book in his presence by II W Kenyon the source in the early movement of the charismatic\n\n(16:09) movement where this new doctrine started to become known let's see how they see things to know that that defeat was administered to him by our substitute talking about Jesus defeating Satan so to know that that defeat was administered to him Satan by our substitute Jesus and said to our credit that's very strange so that in the\n\n(16:37) records of the Supreme Court of the universe we are the Masters of Satan that Satan recognizes that in the name of Jesus we are his rulers when the heart knows this as the body knows heat and cold then faith is unnecessary isn't there a shift of emphasis from Jesus to us here we know that God himself put Satan and all his ability\n\n(16:59) beneath our feet and we are looked upon by the Father and by Satan as Masters of the Dominion of darkness in his presence page 92 now there's a book that was distributed widely under all the Full Gospel churches the Bible says for he must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet Hebrews 2 6 9\n\n(17:25) what is man that you are mindful of him you have put all things under his feet yes that was the promise but now we do not yet see all things put under him but we see Jesus one day Jesus will rule also on this planet supreme Romans 16:20 and the God of peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly not we will\n\n(17:47) crush Satan under our feet this is presumption this is not biblical he continues to say we are taking Jesus's place he came to destroy the works of adversary we are completing the work that he began doesn't that give us tremendous power anything that we can do is nothing without Jesus so who actually\n\n(18:10) does any work around here who can overpower Satan we are like whips compared to him you are a victory made you won get used to it so you can play the part he made us to sit with him in the heavenlies so representatively we are seated on the throne with God that's interesting because if I look at revelation 3:21 it says to him who\n\n(18:33) overcomes I will grant to sit with me on my throne as I also overcame and set with my father on his throne isn't there some overcoming to be done before we can attain to this glory so if the head is exalted the body is exalted with it so we are exalted if he conquered all the forces forces of darkness and lift and paralyzed and\n\n(18:58) broken before he rose from the dead it is as though we had accomplished that mighty work now I believe we're going a little bit far yet don't you think this is beyond gospel that authority and that ability belongs to the believer the recreated man is supernaturally Superman my Bible says he must increase I must\n\n(19:27) decrease all power has been given unto him and without him I can do nothing that's the gospel the two are obviously totally opposed to each other now this is a book that has just come out it's hot off the press people often say via that comes the promise of his return and the authors are dr. Lamar do please see and\n\n(19:54) he's a professor in theology he's one of the charismatic preachers and Isaac Berger he's the president of a huge charismatic church movement Nikhil antman he's the federal president of all Pentecostal churches anton frontier beta he's the moderator of the full evangelical church of god these are the\n\n(20:22) top people in the group there they all are you can have a look at them if you want to and this is what they writes on page 158 the old covenant was annulled with the betrayal of Jesus F Judas sorry but that is kind of strange how could that be a knob with the betrayal of Judas Judas I thought the cross changed things those\n\n(20:50) who still try to keep the law are not spiritually of age and have not yet received the Holy Spirit I thought the Holy Spirit convicts of sin and righteousness and the Spirit is given to those that obey God but if the law is still read these days it must be for people that are not of age that is for unbelievers this is the only sense\n\n(21:11) in which the law is still applicable today believers lived through the spirit and are not under the law Galatians 5:25 very confusing if you confuse the laws one with the other gets worse believers that try to keep the law or in slavery but believers that live in the fullness of the new covenant of free\n\n(21:34) therefore it is dangerous for believers in the church period to be associated with the law churches that read the Ten Commandments on Sundays and in the assembly bring their members under the impression that they are still under their law and that they must try to keep the law Christians who today try to keep\n\n(21:54) the Ten Commandments hinder the work of the Holy Spirit and undermine the pure essence of the New Covenant that's very interesting so it seems that we should rather go out and covet and steal and rape and commit adultery and murder and be miserably rude to our parents and dishonor God then we become of age isn't\n\n(22:24) that what it says does that make any sense that makes no sense to me whatsoever and these are the top top people these are the moderators and the presidents of the big big churches this is very strange indeed revelation 14:12 here's the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the commandments of God and\n\n(22:48) the faith of Jesus well this text whoever wrote this obviously had a false spirit now I know they changed it in the new Bibles the taranta experience what does that entail it's read about this Toronto blessing to soften up Christians to accept the New Age benjamÃ­n cream do you remember him the V representative spokesman for\n\n(23:13) Maitreya the person who is representing the trial the new-age Christ was recently asked about the Toronto blessing his response was that he thought that Toronto blessing was a good thing it is according to him the method being used by his spiritual masters to soften up Christian fundamentalists to accept the new edge Christ when he\n\n(23:33) appears that's a fascinating statement and one worthy of note so who are the great charismatic preachers in the world today and where are we heading in the world well this man over here rodney howard-browne he was known as the holy ghost bartender because that's what they call him because people used to get drunk on holy\n\n(24:02) laughter this man over here is Reinhardt bunker Reinhardt Bonnke is a German preacher who preaches in Africa and he preaches to millions at a time he doesn't mess with small audiences he has huge audiences of two-three million people at a time so obviously they don't fit into a Hall he hires valley's and\n\n(24:28) they put speakers all the way down and then he has healing sermons which consist of screaming very loudly at Satan and saying Satan I curse you I curse you I trample on you I stamp upon you I curse you I stamp upon you I curse you it goes on and on and on until everybody's healed that's basically what\n\n(24:54) it's about laughing in the Lord is another phenomenon which is quite common today unzipper heaven Lord emotionalism much screeching and this is the work of the Holy Spirit people have been falling over laughing uncontrollably rolling around drunk crying deeply we have been unable to stop some meetings because the people\n\n(25:17) are praising God testimonies on numerous and varied it's a giant party is taking place 1 Corinthians 14 40 let all things be done decently and in order this sounds kind of haphazard to me what about speaking in tongues and all these interesting things if we look at a summary chart slain in the spirit\n\n(25:44) occurs in Kundalini Yoga now Kundalini Yoga is a very strange form of yoga where the serpent power is coiled up in the base of the spine and has to be released and it is normally released through the lower body which enough said gives you power in well interesting places then Sobotka young shakers Pentecostals they\n\n(26:12) all have the slain in the spirit but in the Bible you don't have it if somebody fell over in the Bible it was something demonic uncontrollable laughter you're finding Kundalini Yoga see boot kiyong shakers Pentecostals physical jerking you'll find in Kundalini Yoga sobotka young shakers and the Pentecostals\n\n(26:34) animal sounds you'll find them in all of them as well spontaneous movement you'll find them in all of them revival like meetings in all of them and speaking in tongues in basically all of them as well in the Bible it is qualified in Acts chapter 2 as languages to spread the gospel so this is a very strange thing now some of\n\n(26:57) the videos I'm going to show you tonight might be a little bit disturbing but it's good that we can see the comparisons and what actually goes on so we will have to ask the Lord to protect us if we're looking here in the Eastern religions where you have the heating of the gongs these are Sun worship rituals\n\n(27:19) and they're very common the form of worship that we have in the East here is Surya worship Surya is also the one that travels through the sky on the 25th of December in his carriage much like we celebrate Christmas and raising of the arms is very common in Kundalini worship Surya worship and awaiting the rising of\n\n(27:48) the Sun morning worship this year is the famous famous Connor rock temple in India where you have the ladies doing their dances now each hand movement has a meaning and most of these dances an esoteric and a erotic function and they have to do with sexuality and sometimes exceedingly perverse sexuality\n\n(28:19) the statues all around this temple are absolutely sensible so there they are you can have a look at them I have had to draw a line through every single one of them because they are literally supersonically pornographic because this is where the power comes from it is the ancient old sex cult religion of Isis\n\n(28:44) now in Kundalini Yoga what happens is you dance and move rhythmically to a very strong rhythm and then the forces are pushed into the lower parts of the body and once this happens well then you are open for a spirit that enters you and gives you this power but it's a form of demonic position I don't even know\n\n(29:11) whether I want to show this video but I'll show it anyway and those who don't want to look close the eyes his brand of yoga called dynamic meditation is a new-age combination of Hinduism and psychotherapies this exercise involving rigorous breathing and hyperventilation is designed to arouse the serpent force called\n\n(29:38) Kundalini which the Guru's believe lies coiled at the base of the spine I did dynamic meditation everyday we also called it Kundalini meditation it starts off with a cathartic breathing and the reason for it is just to move your energy and to get you out of your head and into your body and you just breathe\n\n(30:08) [Music] through a Tampin a little kid enough song right that's what happens in Eastern religions now you might think that that is shameful wait till you see what happens in Christian religions and see whether there's much difference between the one and the other the drum of course is very important in this\n\n(31:18) because the drum gives the rhythm that's why in the sanctuary service and the Bible a drum was never permitted the drum was used by the woman when and there was a hand drum but when the soldiers came back from Warren was used for joy and had was not used in a worship setter the drum in the African ritual is holy\n\n(31:40) it is worshipped like a God the open hand is very important it is put away it is worshipped open hands in to the sky are part and parcel of such worship now Cardinal Joseph sueance Templeton Prize recipient we're always looking for the connections here remember that varakin - as we discussed in the previous lecture\n\n(32:02) said that after 1962 the services had to get livelier there had to be movement of arms gesticulation bodily attitudes exclamations internal-external all of those things had to take place so Cardinal science was intensely involved with the charismatic movement and was chosen by pope john xxiii who led the\n\n(32:25) vatican ii council to be one of the chief architects of the vatican ii meetings he served on all four of its major committees suin stated since I have had this charismatic experience my allegiance to the Holy Father as the Vicar of Christ in the world has been heightened and strengthened my appreciation for Mary as the career\n\n(32:44) temptress and mediate risks of my salvation has been assured my appreciation of the mass says the sacrifice of Christ has now been heightened so the spirit that gave him this charismatic experience did it lead him to the Bible or did it lead him to the doctrines of Rome certainly didn't lead him to the Bible and I don't\n\n(33:05) believe that that was the Spirit of Truth sewins also hosted and gave the opening speech at the Second World Conference on religion peace he received Pope Paul the sixth is blessing delegations were particularly impressed with the important role that religious unity will play in establishing the coming world government\n\n(33:23) a continual call was sounded for a new world order and a Catholic leadership the Lorraine declaration status Buddhist Christian's Confucius Hindus Jains Jews Muslims Shintoist Sikhs or Russians and store others we have sought here to listen to the spirit within our variant and venerable religious traditions we\n\n(33:43) appeal to the religious communities of the world to inculcate the attitude of planetary citizenship so here we're talking about a unity of all these movements the temple of understanding is a very interesting group again that is in the Cathedral of st. John the Divine the set ringabel whenever we hear the\n\n(34:04) Saint John my ears prick up we're at one time and naked female Christ called crista was hung on the cross now the temple of understanding they say the purple of the purpose of the temple of understanding is the worldwide promotion of interfaith dialogue and education to achieve understanding and harmony among\n\n(34:25) the people of the world's religions and beyond the temple of understanding maintains a strong commitment to the integrity of each religion or faith tradition and believes that each can better remain true to itself by honoring the truths inherent in all traditions that means everyone must accept what the\n\n(34:44) other one teaches irrespective of whether it is in harmony with what the Bible says or whether it is not in harmony with what the Bible says furthermore organization affiliated to the United Nations of course in the fall of 1998 the temple of understanding newsletter explains interfaith is most fundamentally respect at the bottom line\n\n(35:08) it is respecting different traditions different religions different faiths so maybe a slogan we can have is not conversion but communion communion with compassion very interesting now I have no problem respecting any religion freedom of choice you're a free agent you can belong to any religion that you\n\n(35:32) want to but don't force me to compromise mine to bring it in line with what everybody else is believing that's not biblical and not according to what the Bible says that's the bottom line but now the watchword is not conversion but communion so where we shifting to we're shifting from a God based religion\n\n(35:58) to a man based religion alpha-1 christian researcher reveals now what is alpha alpha is a state of mind that is to be induced to make you open to this union and there are many aspects of alpha which can go very very deep and in the higher levels it's nothing other than a form of hypnosis so let's have a\n\n(36:27) look at this alpha cause between 8 and 13 vibrations visualization is able to take place so visualization and remember robert schuller said visualization is a good thing vibrations at this frequency are called alpha rhythms in his very popular book celebration of discipline richard foster points out that the meditative\n\n(36:47) visualization in addition to catapulting one into a divine human encounter maintains a consistent alpha level brainwave pattern so when you have this experience because of the divine human encounter then you're in alpha state the Alpha state is associated with other interesting phenomena the hypnotic\n\n(37:10) trance exists within the Alpha level 9 and hypnotic trance someone else can manipulate you to do what his will is so that's why people can run around acting like chickens or doing whatever because it has been implanted because of this the visualization technique is included within material offering self-hypnosis\n\n(37:34) the alcohol trances of Edgar Cayce are found within alpha a truth serum drugs such as sodium pentothal causes lapse into the alpha state you can also open the way to alpha using other chemicals visualization is actually hypnosis it's a light form of hypnosis psychologist Michael Yap co explains many times therapists aren't\n\n(37:59) even aware that they're doing hypnosis they're doing what they call guided imagery which is visualization or guided meditation which are all very mainstream hypnotic techniques so now would you like to have a style of worship where you are induced to believe that you're having an encounter and this this\n\n(38:20) satisfy a need or would you like to have a relationship with Jesus Christ that is the question are we dealing with the human or are we dealing with the divine so who are the Alpha endorses Archbishop George Kerry it was the Archbishop of Canterbury he was the leader of the Anglican Church 700 of the world's\n\n(38:46) leading evangelists attending Billy Graham's major conference Amsterdam 2000 in August attended official events where major presentations of the Alpha course who were given top billing so Billy Graham also enforces alpha at Billy Graham's Amsterdam meeting George Kerry said that's why I want to give a\n\n(39:04) plug for one of your workshops tomorrow alphas great success lies in its ability to take evangelism out of the church into the home and to bridge the gulf between church and community there's Kerry with the Pope so interesting little connections coming here so alpha you can take and put it into the home so you need not\n\n(39:26) necessarily have a full scale alpha in the church but in subgroups you can induce this state by preparing the person and then eventually you will be open to the Holy Spirit and be able to speak in tongues and all these things can happen now who are the endorsers of the Alpha calls let's have a look at\n\n(39:46) some of the names Charles Colson Bob Wright Tony Campolo Jack Hayford Karndean William Akhil Archbishop of Baltimore Richard foster Bill Hybels very interesting man and that's Willow Creek fan Pat Robertson Louie pelo George Gallup David yonggi cho billy kim cedar a frequent speaker at the Billy Graham School of\n\n(40:08) evangelism Robert Schuller what would you expect nothing else Leighton Ford that's Billy Graham's brother-in-law and former vice president of Billy Graham Evangelistic Association all of these people enforced alpha now why would I have to induce a altered state of consciousness in order for people to\n\n(40:28) understand their need for salvation or to honor the one who has saved them the science of witchcraft is based on our ability to enter an altered state of consciousness we call alpha where brainwaves register at seven to fourteen cycles per second as mentioned earlier this is a state of consciousness\n\n(40:47) associated with a relaxation meditation and dreaming these are witches telling you that they use alpha now shouldn't light and darkness be as far removed from his other as the East is from the West now let us have a look at the biblical spirit of Satan and Ezekiel 28 we read some interesting verses where Satan is\n\n(41:14) used in a symbol of the king of tyre the king of tyre is basically showing the attributes of Satan so in a sense it is Satan the word of the Lord came again unto me saying son of man say unto the Prince of Tyrus thus says the Lord God because thine heart is lifted up and thou has said I am God important principle I sit in the seat of\n\n(41:41) God in the midst of the Seas that's what the devil does that's what Satan does but he induces that spirit in his followers yet thou art a man and not God that though they are sit down heart is the heart of God behold thou art wiser than Daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee so don't think that\n\n(42:04) you can fool on the devil or pull on his tail and he'll run away in fear this is subtle subtle subtle subtle activity that we are often not even aware of with eye wisdom and with understanding there has gotten the richest and has gotten gold and silver unto thy treasures by thy great wisdom and by thy traffic has there increased\n\n(42:30) crease thy riches and mine heart is lifted up because of thy riches this is all selfishness therefore thus says the Lord God because thou has set thine heart as the heart of God this comes up frequently behold therefore I will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw the swords\n\n(42:50) against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defiled our brightness and they shall bring me down to the pit and I shall die the diffs of them that are slain in the midst of the Seas wilt thou yet say before him that slay thee I am God but there shall be a man and no God in the hand of him that slay\n\n(43:08) thee so this spirit of I want to be like the Most High he's the spirit of Satan bottom line now let's go back to where the megachurches and their teaching come from the - started the megachurch concept was none other than Robert Schuller and Robert Schuller remember says in his book self esteem and we can\n\n(43:35) pray our Father in heaven honorable is our name so he lifted himself up to the level of God Robert Schuller according to most sources out there in the world books web pages I've just given one here is a 33 degree Freemason pastor of Crystal Cathedral and host of the popular hour of power television program\n\n(43:59) now we've dealt with Freemasonry and what the high level believes they believe that they are gods Robert Schuller quotes from self-esteem notice now carefully classical theology has heard in its insistence that theology be God centered and not man-centered we had this quote before but it's very relevant to our\n\n(44:23) meeting tonight so we need an emphasis from God centered religion to man centered religion the church's problem is that it has had a god centered theology for Sentret centuries when it needs a man centered one is that strange that it seemed good enough for 6,000 years but not at the end we need another\n\n(44:47) one it would be an insult to the integrity of any human being to call him a sinner and jesus knew his Worth he successfully self esteem and then comes this terrible statement over here but the crux of the matter is let's shift from God centered to man centered and he says I hallowed be our name that's the\n\n(45:12) spirit of thank you that's the spirit of Satan that's not the Spirit of God speaking over there let's have a look at his own web page this is his hour of power dot-org that's his own web page there is teaching pastors how to be have a power church 2004 Robert Schuller Institute and here we have the debts you're\n\n(45:38) invited to discover fantastic new dream for your church who else does he figure on his main web page Bill Hybels that's very interesting that's the man from Willow Creek it's your church all God wants it to be send your pastors and late church leaders to the 31st Robert ed Shula Institute for successful church\n\n(45:59) leadership which brings together the most prominent pastors who make faith come alive in some of the country's largest churches many mentions to people on the front page of his web page when he is a 33 degree freemason speaking the same spirit that Lucifer had like Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Community Church and a\n\n(46:28) record of Saddleback Church both graduates of the Institute that's fascinating I find that extremely interesting those are the two people that run the mega churches of the world and we need to look into this issue a little bit more carefully and then maybe we can see where the world is heading may the Lord bless us as we do\n\n(46:55) so you in the previous session we saw that rick warren the megachurch leaders of the world are endorsed here by robert schuller well he actually goes further we have to find out where his inspiration comes from now Robert Schuller says I found myself immediately attracted to pope john paul ii went upon his election to\n\n(47:35) the papacy his published speeches invariably called attention to the need for recognition for recognizing the dignity of the human being as a child of God aha now remember there has been a shift in the law from the law of God to human rights and the Pope says we must take care of needs so I am calling this\n\n(48:03) defining the need what is the need that individuals have or what are their needs and Robert Shula has found a perfect niche in this he tries to satisfy the need for self esteem everybody needs to feel that they are important so if he can feed their self-esteem then he is satisfying and need something that\n\n(48:33) people really want and that fills up the churches but the question is is it bringing them the gospel of repentance and salvation in Jesus Christ yes or no no there's been a shift from God centered to man centered and as we have said both hybels was on his webpage so let's see where this man comes in the\n\n(49:00) man who inspired Bill Hybels the one was dr. Gilbert ballistic on his french-born professor I don't know whether pronounce that right of Trinity College in Deerfield Illinois he was there and he indoctrinated Bill Hybels into this new kind of ministry but notice what Robert Schuller a 33 degree Freemason according\n\n(49:22) to most sources as we have seen says about this young man I was the first person to introduce real church growth to the American church he hybels became the first guy to take these principles refine them maximize them to the ultimate length of their potential I am so proud of him I think of him as a son I think of him\n\n(49:45) as one of the greatest things to happen in Christianity in our time Bill Hybels is doing the best job of anybody I know well if Robert Schuller says that then I would be very very wary I would look at this very very carefully George Barna a prominent church growth strategist has said that both Bill Hybels and Rick\n\n(50:08) Warren have gone as far as to say it is critical that we keep in mind the fundamental principle of Christian communication the audience not the message is sovereign okay whose God then the audience the audience is God if your advertising is going to stop people in the midst of hectic schedules and cause\n\n(50:34) them to think about what they're saying our message has to be adapted to the needs of the audience here we have needs coming in again let's satisfy the needs of the people here is a critic the CIA Pritchard he wrote this book Pritchard Willow Creek Secret Service's Grand Rapids Baker books and he says he's will\n\n(50:54) a creek correct in their teaching that a relationship with Christ will provide a life of fulfillment you know what no personal fulfillment is the dominant goal of the vast majority of Americans in this context it is a great temptation for American evangelists to argue that Christianity is a means of a more fulfilling life the\n\n(51:15) church becomes another place that promises to satisfy emotional desires to argue for Christianity primarily by pointing to its usefulness in satisfying felt needs is to ultimately undercut it isn't that correct well you know preaching Jesus Christ or are you satisfying needs he also goes on to say now I ever rather than sure\n\n(51:39) self-esteem message being promoted as debate debate is rather personal fulfillment we rejoice that the pure Schuler and heresy the redefinition of sin was abandoned nevertheless at Willow Creek cinestyle minimal are minimized and marginalized Hybels teachings exhibited strong reliance on psychological categories not as strongly\n\n(52:02) as Schuler's but still very real so Schuler emphasizes self-esteem hybl stresses personal fulfillment user-friendly doctrine so basically this just another need that has to be full form what about Rick Warren he's pastor over 14,000 members Saddleback Valley Community Church in in Orange County and he writes in his book The Purpose Driven\n\n(52:28) Church he's saying is being used as a manual of course in many circles he has the principle of pragmatism he says pastors need to learn to recognize a wave of God's Spirit and ride it did you see something sapling do it or catch a spiritual wave of growth if it works it must be right he encourages young pastors to believe\n\n(52:50) behind old-fashioned church music in favor of jazz or rock or whatever turns your people on these all quotes encourages churches to to imitate culture dress down for church let your hair down but be relaxed come with your sandwich let's eat something in church Warren attempts to shelter himself from\n\n(53:11) criticism on this issue he says never criticize what God is blessing even though it may be a style of ministry that makes you uncomfortable who says God is behind this who says that Rick Warren uses the very same methodology that Robert Schuler and Hybels uses not surprisingly Shula praises the book inside the front cover\n\n(53:31) and hybels highlights the book on the Willow Creek internet Warren spent 12 weeks going door-to-door surveying the needs of the people okay so now you have a long list of needs so poor community they can't afford to fix their cars so we're gonna have a needs committee and the mechanics in the area will come\n\n(53:54) together and help the poor people that satisfies a need they get their cars fixed so it's very useful to come to this church because you have a need that is satisfied if you have marital problems will have a marital group and will satisfy that need if you have a problem coping with your lawn because\n\n(54:10) you've got kids and all of this maybe somebody can help them cut your lawn occasionally and we'll have a lawn committee and that'll satisfy that need and in the end everybody is so busy satisfying needs that to heck with the gospel who needs that we're all satisfied with our needs now is that Christianity isn't that the job of a\n\n(54:30) social club isn't that the job of the government what do we pay taxes for aren't we bringing government functions into the church yes or no taking care of the needs of the underprivileged that should be their function I'm not saying that we as Christians shouldn't help the poor absolutely I would never send a\n\n(54:50) poor man away from my house without giving him something to eat or satisfying a need if I see it but if that becomes my Christianity and I satisfy needs from morning till night then all I am doing is making that individual dependent upon whom upon me now what does that do to my self-esteem it lifts it up because I am needed and\n\n(55:19) the more I am needed the more I satisfy those in the community it's very pleasing in to be in this situation but what about Jesus Christ where does he fit into all of this so we have a man for centered philosophy figure out what mood you want your service to project and then create it that's what he said\n\n(55:44) on page 264 we start positive and then positive that's not a bad idea we use humor in our services I have no problem with that cultivate an informal relaxed and friendly atmosphere well I go to church to worship God and God says he's an awesome guy let all the world be reverent before him I don't go to church to go and kick my\n\n(56:10) shoes off from be relaxed I'm in the presence of a holy God so I the problem with that we made a strategic decision to stop singing hymns in a seeker services we have attracted thousands more because of our music saddleback now has a complete pop rock orchestra use more performed music than in congregational singing so what do we\n\n(56:37) have now we are satisfying a need for entertainment good the ground we have in common with unbelievers is not the Bible but our common needs hurts interests as human beings you cannot start with a text well Bill Hybels you're speaking like Shula you also spoke like the devil it's exactly the same and I mean Warren\n\n(57:09) make your members feel special they need to feel special yes you are special you are sons and daughters of the Living God but the only one you can trust that too is God himself because he is unselfish the only true worship comes from a total giving of yourself through your own world because God never forces you and\n\n(57:36) you can only entrust your inner feelings to someone like God who is totally unselfish and will never ever coerce you into anything else if you entrust yourself to the spirit of Satan you have a problem because needs will never end the poor we will have with us until the very last day is that correct or not and\n\n(57:57) your need religion will be driven this is actually Catholicism at its very best I can pick up poor people and I can make it my religion to do so and I will never never never run out of needy people you should have just the letter without neglecting the former which is what leading them to Christ leading them to repentance and\n\n(58:25) truly uplifting them in Jesus Christ because Matthew 6:31 therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed isn't that needs religion God says don't take any need any thought about that for after all these things do the who run their Gentiles seek for your\n\n(58:52) heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you we've taken this biblical text now in the modern world turned it upside down and said no not this way the other way will satisfy the needs after all God we\n\n(59:17) don't need you goodbye we can do it for you we are Superman this is arrogance of the highest degree arrogance of the highest degree and it is so deceptive because it works so beautifully everybody's satisfied the one who receives is satisfied and the one who gives is satisfied and the Lord where is he looking on smiling and seeing people\n\n(59:42) get lost because they don't turn from sin do you think he's smiling I don't think so the style of music you choose to use in your services be one of the most critical and controversial decisions you make in the life of your church so you take our rubs Roberts Church or Kenneth Hagins Church the one uses contemporary\n\n(1:00:07) rock the other one uses country and wisdom so whether you come to serve God depends on whether your style of music is being played is that religion or is that need satisfaction or is that self-satisfaction you know bitter not a morsel of music and honest desire for God then this I'm not against music I love music and I\n\n(1:00:40) love worshiping God in song but that's not the issue here we are replacing something you must match your music to the kind of people you God wants in your church know the kind of people you want in the church the music you use positions your church in your community it will determine the kind of people you\n\n(1:01:00) attract the kind of people you keep and the kind of people you lose if you were to tell me the kind of music you are currently using in your services I could describe the kind of people you are reaching without eating visiting your church I could also tell you the kind of people your church will never reach one\n\n(1:01:15) to eighty to eighty one house you know the gospel changes people Colossians 3:16 let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord not having your own thing there this style\n\n(1:01:42) or that style you think putting christian lyrics in it is going to change it not one iota let's talk about music the non neutrality of music is clearly recognized by numerous musicians themselves for example Howard Hanson famous composer and former head of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester New\n\n(1:02:02) York sake music is made up of many ingredients and according to the proportion of these components it can be soothing invigorating ennobling of vulgar rising philosophical orgiastic that's pretty true it has powerful evil as well as for good it's not neutral so I don't care what Warren says he says it\n\n(1:02:22) doesn't matter what style you use as long as the lyrics are Christian that's not biblical and it's not even sensible defenders of the use of Christian rock music for worship and evangelism intend that music is void of moral qualities this view is emphatically stated in what is known as the Christian rocker\n\n(1:02:42) Creed they say that published in the popular CCM they say we hold these truths to be self-evident that all music was created equal that no instrument to style of music is in itself evil that the diversity of musical expression which flows from man is but one evidence of the boundless creativity of your\n\n(1:03:01) heavenly Father rock star Jimi Hendrix States the same view most emphatically you can hypnotize people with the music and when they get at their weakest point you can preach into their subconscious minds what you want them what you want to say so musics not neutral they're thought-provoking but music anabolics\n\n(1:03:26) Frank Allah can quote what Saul acknowledged that a large segment of the Christian community has enthusiastically embraced this music of the world the associated antics and the philosophy all three have been implanted in the life of the church not only I've missed many Christians accepted the music as\n\n(1:03:43) suitable for praise and worship but an atmosphere pervades the contemporary Christian concerts not like unlike the early concerts of the Elvis era or rock and roll Wolfgang Stefani says could it be that by fostering a modernized global music style a style that is increasingly visible in the Christian music culture\n\n(1:04:04) the stage is set for a global religious identity response is the music going to bring us all together Daniel 3 verse 10 thou our King has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet the flute the hop the sackbut psaltery the dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image all kinds\n\n(1:04:28) of music that will be a sign of the end here is a son that or a whole record there was sung by Cowboy Junkies and where was this recorded captured life at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Toronto Canada on November 27 1987 so this is a song that was played in the church this is church music it has a sort of nice country\n\n(1:05:01) Weston's flavor sounds quite peaceful and the lyrics are very interesting but of course if you are in a sway mood who cares about the lyrics right and this was in the church he's crazy and he scares me and I want him by my side he's wild in his way sometimes just plain mad but I need him to keep me satisfied Papa don't cry it's\n\n(1:05:27) alright I see you in some of these ways you might not give me the life that you wanted I love him the rest of my days misguided angel hanging over me how unlike Gabriel you're my desire to be listen carefully [Music] they're singing to lucifer they say they will love him till death this is in the Church of Toronto and they're so blatant\n\n(1:06:04) that they don't even mind singing openly to Lucifer this is Billy Graham and evangelism you all know about him Billy Graham musicians draw record crowds in his 2002 campaign Billy Graham contemporary Christian musicians to a record crowd in the third night of the Metroplex mission estimated 82 thousand people attended\n\n(1:06:27) the event which included a 30-minute message from Graham and musical performance by jars of clay Kurt Franklin DC Talk ministry spokesman Larry Ross said the audience included about 12,000 who watched the two-hour event from a large television screen in the Stadium parking lot about 5,000 others were seated on the stadium floor\n\n(1:06:48) so for hours they sat and they listened actually to the music let's have a look at the bands that Billy Graham and the papacy and all the top evangelists used stevan Steven Curtis Chapman well he Graham's used him in his June 2002 crusade in Nashville Tennessee also featured groups like jaws of clay DC\n\n(1:07:10) talked at Franklin's the Steven Curtis Chapman there is interesting little hand signs Kurt Franklin at grams and Lois crusade held so and so once again we find musical guests include michael w smith Charlie's Daniels bands Kurt Franklin DC Talk CC Wynans all of those bands michael w smith let's talk about him is such a famous singer\n\n(1:07:35) today in Christian circles if you look at his album over there you'll have those sunrise flashing out there Smith was using marijuana Alice T cocaine at the same time as he was painting gospel songs there's the quotes everything is under quote nothing here is hearsay here are his records there is using run writing\n\n(1:07:59) that's used by Satanists by the way Smith even has a cultic runic symbols on his record album and the flip side has Smith's name written backwards which is an occult way writing reversal is satanic principle Master Satanist Allen Crowley taught his disciples to walk backwards walk backwards think backwards\n\n(1:08:18) speak backwards write backwards and even listen to phonograph records backwards to gain insight into the future so he has all these strange symbols on his record there's Amy Grant she's known as the Madonna of rock music because she's not shy to say in a rock concert in church that she's feeling well aroused\n\n(1:08:39) forget about that interesting lady how important is that part of grants aspiration for her songs came from John Denver of course was a pantheist involved in EST and pantheism st. John's University Oh whenever I hear that name I get so nervous gave its highest award to rock star Amy Grant she's the third woman to receive the\n\n(1:09:04) pucks Christie award often called a jewel in the crown of the Roman Catholic Church why is it that Billy Graham has all these nuns and priests working for him in his campaigns and he's using bands that are using Alice t use Satanist symbols and use pornographic language even in their services DC Talk\n\n(1:09:25) is another interesting band used by Billy Graham the Pope all of them together Graham likes DC Talk and they get their role models from u2 now you choose an interesting band their lead man is Bono and he was one of the lead singers in nelson mandela's could you remember what it was four six six six four concert and they sometimes included\n\n(1:09:55) Beatles Dobby Brothers songs so-called Christian conscious DC Talk even use use drug-addict Jimi Hendrix's song Purple Haze with references to drugs now this Bono who they honor very highly and there's Bono with bull gates and Bono with his band but is an interesting cross if you look at it carefully it has the bent cross it's\n\n(1:10:19) the same one that the papacy uses it's a Satan symbol it's used by Satanists as well there he is with the Pope and it's obviously a very prominence man Charlie Daniels Band another group used by Graham and his Crusades Charlie Daniels in an interview with Daniels by Huntsville Times they quoted him using\n\n(1:10:40) profanity a former which says that his band is famous for his songs about a violent duel between man and the devil all kinds of interesting things country-western perversion is inexcusable jars of clay by the way most popular Christian band patents their music after the Beatles and other groups and what else have they done they\n\n(1:11:02) performed for Billy Graham this group has recorded for an r-rated film loaded with live-in lovers nudity graphic violence 83 obscenities we could go on and on and on these are good role models for Christianity don't you think well let's have a look at some of the music played when the Pope came along\n\n(1:11:24) [Music] [Applause] it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience to see the Pope so I figured out very good out here and if I have my chance to do it it's pretty exciting it's a it's a neat atmosphere with everybody gathering around Asti he's such a world leader it's a very special day for sale [Applause] [Music]\n\n(1:12:06) [Applause] [Music] [Music] please Holly now it's the next bad DC Talk the supernatural are you sure there's some sort of gospel message in this loud sure the Gospels two Gospels in all sorts of delivery systems with our old organ music and the great hymns of the Reformation and afterward music is a good carrier for\n\n(1:13:11) good news and this is good news it may not be the good news that we're used to hearing but these young people understand it the rumors are correct now you see Big Mac himself greeting Pope John Paul the second the young people caught a glimpse of that and they got even more exciting [Applause] the message is a simple one holy father\n\n(1:14:04) the young people of America love you tells me that tonight the proverb belongs to you did you hear one word about Jesus one I didn't hear one this is self worship at its worst using bands lots of arm swing but now comes the saddest story of all it's going to get a lot worse as we have said Benjamin Kreme said that Maitreya told\n\n(1:14:49) him that the Toronto blessing was to soften up Christian fundamentalists so now let's have a look at the great charismatic preachers and see where they really come from and what they stand for one of the greatest is probably Kenneth Copeland when Jesus Christ that is finished it was he was not speaking of\n\n(1:15:10) the plan of redemption there were still three days and nights to go through before he went to the throne he Jesus is suffering all that there is to suffer and there's no suffering left apart from him his emaciated poured out little wormy spirit is down in the bottom of that thing hell and the devil thinks\n\n(1:15:26) he's got him destroyed believers voice of victory program these are all his statements now let's go a little further you don't have a God in you you are one thank you now Peter said by exceeding great and precious promises you become partake of the divine cloth or right or we God's we are a class of God's that\n\n(1:15:48) Adam was God manifest in the flesh God reason for creating Adam was his desire to reproduce himself I mean a reproduction of himself in the Garden of Eden he did just that he was not a little like God he was not almost like God he was not sub ordinate to God even Adam is as much like God as you could\n\n(1:16:08) get just the same as Jesus Adam in the Garden of Eden was God manifest in the flesh well that is serpent language or God language this is devil language and it is feeding man's need for self esteem for greatness Kenneth Copeland what are you saying the Spirit of God spoke to me and he said son realize this now follow\n\n(1:16:36) me in this and don't let your tradition trip you up he said think this way a twice bone man whip gee whipped Satan Wow Jesus was twice born interesting in his own domain and I threw the Bible down like that I said what he said the born-again men defeated Satan the firstborn of many brethren defeated him\n\n(1:16:54) he said you are the very image of the and of the very copy of that one I said goodness gracious sakes alive and I began to see what I what been going on and then I said well now you don't mean you couldn't there mean that I could have done the same thing he said oh yeah God said this apparently oh yeah if\n\n(1:17:14) you'd had the knowledge of the word of God that he did you could have done the same thing cause you're a reborn man too so Kenneth Copeland could have saved you did you know that this is the highest form of blasphemy I've ever come across what else does he say and I say this with all respect so that you don't get\n\n(1:17:33) upset too bad but I say it anyway when I read in the Bible where he says I am I just smile and say yes I am - okay well what does he have in common with Robert Schuller everything everything Robert Schuller is a 33 degree Freemason according to most of the sources and his teaching is definitely in line with the\n\n(1:17:55) highest form of Freemasonry and if you look at Kenneth's corporate ministries what are the symbols that he's using what's that a compass and a set square do you think it's there by chance I don't think so I think this man is a Luciferian masquerading in robes of righteousness deceiving Millions that's\n\n(1:18:18) what he's doing as is Robert Schuller as it seems all the others gods on the outside looking in he doesn't have any legal entry into the earth the thing doesn't belong to him Wow I don't even want to read the rest it irritates me Freemasonry the Mormon movement Kenneth Copeland they say the same thing Adam is\n\n(1:18:40) our Father and our God God said Brigham Young Copeland says exactly the same thing this Copeland's shot magazine all the symbols of Freemasonry and some vile ones I won't talk about that one up there there's the upside-down pentagram and all the symbols that you need to see where this man is coming from well if the symbols\n\n(1:19:00) don't give him away his statements certainly do well let's have a look at his hand movements now if you do not know this is the symbol of the goat which is used by many Satanists and it could just be chance but they all use it so frequently I doubt whether it is choice so let's have another look at him\n\n(1:19:44) that was an interesting statement Kenneth Copeland Jesus physical nature he has the traits of his mother which theology is there that is Roman Catholic insider theology and it is freemason theology and it's satanic simple as that because they say Jesus got his attributes from his mother not from his\n\n(1:20:14) father so what is teaching is not biblical it is Freemasonry talk some all started getting drunk on the Holy Ghost instead of that Jim Beam or something you know [Music] [Laughter] I get to do this for Jesus okay so you can get drunk for Jesus other than using booze so it does it for Jesus but it gets more interesting as we\n\n(1:20:46) go along this is probably the largest worldwide charismatic Church in the world the Rhema movement have you heard of it it is massive and it uses the sword Rhema Bible Training Center the people in charge or the founders Kenneth Hagin and his wife probably one of the great charismatic founders and teachers in the\n\n(1:21:12) world today they use the field of the shield of faith over there which is the same as the Templars used by the way they have a huge Center down in Oklahoma the only difference between them and Oral Roberts is the style of music that's it the style of music a huge central stage that can lift up with a\n\n(1:21:33) band can be raised and lowered he used the Masonic symbol on his his newspaper and he has placed this Masonic obelisks on it and he's in the same area as they are this is Oral Roberts he uses the upside-down triangle he uses the man with the raised arm in the triangle with a flame on top of that these are all\n\n(1:22:00) called symbols he uses the Easton hands over there here he is praying over thousands of letters he's the one who said if the Americans don't give me X million by the end of the week God is going to kill him I would have tested the Lord on that one I wouldn't have given him the money here is his his buildings the design is\n\n(1:22:23) highly symbolic the pillars which garnish the building represent the pillars of King Solomon's Temple here we have again Freemasonry sneaking in again over here everything is based on on the star of day but all the occult symbols are built into his compound now let's have a look at a church service with\n\n(1:22:44) Kenneth Hagin the founder and prophet of the Rhema movement the Lord just worldwide charismatic movement in the world stretches from the southern tip of Africa into the East Bloc countries into China all over the world and literally thousands of pastors come to his Center to be trained [Applause] that's gonna stop them by the line\n\n(1:23:40) [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] okay very interesting let's have a look at just one little bit more there's something else I want to say [Applause] drunks all about [Applause] well in the end they jerk around just like they did in the Eastern one here's another famous evangelist television\n\n(1:24:39) preacher Jesse Duplantis let's have a look at him I do know when I start doing things for God in a big way like buying more television time building did you see his hand movement okay let's carry on hidden channels of communication God had prepared that man to meet us so we could be a blessing to him okay that man I wonder who that man\n\n(1:25:10) is would you enlighten us Jesse Duplantis I thinks that no one will pick this up listen for the words all right very well hidden you can't hear a thing just about if you really slow down and have a studio listen you can actually say see he's hiding it's the name Satan in a so-called speaking in tongues we'll get\n\n(1:25:45) a little bit better one and then do it again did you hear it I'm with Satan and he makes that sign and he hides it in his speaking in tongues but when you become a son you have son that serve see you have on the floor people that's very interesting so who are these people that make satanic signs and command millions\n\n(1:26:32) and millions of dollars to preach the gospel and Kenneth Copeland with these freemason signs that says we are all God's is a friend with Kenneth Hagin is a friend with Oral Roberts is a friend with Robert Schuller as a friend with believers is a friend with us one friends of the don't birds of a feather\n\n(1:26:50) flock together and where do they get the money to command all these things this is the one of the greatest telly evangelists of all time and before I get to Benny Hinn I think it would be advisable if we took just a few seconds break and let us ponder these things who is replacing whom are we having a needs\n\n(1:27:13) gospel or are we having a Jesus Christ gospel you I want to talk about Benny Hinn here is Benny Hinn probably one of the great televangelist now he's a faith healer he has identified a certain need man's need for healing and he's going to supply that Mead his philosophy is he says quote don't tell me you have Jesus you\n\n(1:27:55) are everything he was and everything he is and ever shall be don't say I have say I am I am I am I am and I am that's the same as Robert Schuller said in other words this man is saying he's God and this person is dressed in white and is going to present this kind of gospel does he say we are little gods or\n\n(1:28:23) whatever it mean he's quite there since we are a little God then aren't we well it was very short yeah it says yes we are little gods now the Bible says bless them that curse you in the beginning of this video you will hear Kenneth Copeland saying that those who go against his ministry die and many of\n\n(1:28:43) them have got cancer and then we'll watch how the Benny Hinn reacts to those who oppose his ministry thoroughly grieve because of it and there's more than one of them got cancer I place a curse every man and every woman that will stretch his hand against this anointing I curse that man who dares to speak a\n\n(1:29:18) word against it is finished the Bible says you can reveal error but you don't have to curse the person I wouldn't dare to do that Kenneth Copeland's Kenneth Hagin Benny Hinn all of them claimed to have spoken to Jesus Danya It was as though someone plugged me into electricity my entire body was numb\n\n(1:29:53) under this awesome feeling of power and suddenly a few feet from me I saw the Lord he was six feet something tall maybe six two six three long hair brown light brown hair his eyes are never forget his eyes they looked right through me in the morning I woke up and told my mom I said mom last night I saw\n\n(1:30:28) Jesus and mom looked at me and she said well then you you must be a saint okay he saw Jesus Jesus appeared to him as to the others now you can see Jesus in a vision you can have a vision and be taken up and see Jesus but Jesus coming down to this earth and appearing to you is not biblical it's spiritism why because the Bible\n\n(1:30:58) says I go to prepare a place for you and I will come again to take you to be where I am also in the meantime I'll send you what the comforter and he will be with you until Jesus comes again so if someone says he saw Jesus here or there or wherever it's spiritism and jesus warned do not believe them when\n\n(1:31:24) they say was here or he was there or wherever in the inner room it's not true so that is spiritism I will look at bunker and vineyards at the forefront of the charismatic movement at least in ratings terms are two very different men Reinhardt bunker a German and Benny Hinn Palestinian by birth but now commanding\n\n(1:32:00) the heights of the fiercely competitive business of American television evangelism [Music] all things are possible to him that believeth all things are possible to him that believeth all things all things every need every prayer all things are possible all you have to do is believe [Music] [Music] substance what's happened to the man\n\n(1:33:17) ten years ago pastor he had a locking accident the power of God came upon him tonight James McCracken left his body you cannot sadly James his condition has deteriorated since perhaps movement is now so painful he can no longer dress himself but James remain so convinced that a miracle took place that he's\n\n(1:33:37) refused prescribed medication and the operation his doctor now considers imperative [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] what did we see what was he Kate catering to did you see those poor people sitting there sick being ministered to getting their trips what is their hope to be healed he is catering to a need he has identified a\n\n(1:34:37) need for health and healing and he has deceived these people that he is the one who's going to supply the need and the people believed that delusion and God is not in it because here is another spirit as we will see in a moment this was mesma when he mesmerised this woman this has been in when he mesmerizes this\n\n(1:35:08) woman in an interview he was told asked whether what he does is hypnosis and he was confronted when they said to him what you are doing ez hypnosis and the top hypnotist say that you are very good at hypnosis notice what he does when the people get slain in the spirit the anointing to personal charisma and well-tried\n\n(1:35:37) techniques of crowd manipulation benny hinn adds another dramatic ingredient actually it's an old hypnotist trick and it's been around for hundreds of years first look swish is going to fall you must let every guard down first there's the classic hypnotic induction you will not protect even your emotions anymore you become completely\n\n(1:36:11) opened because the anointing demands that every part of you be open and at those moments you are extremely fragile and extremely sensitive we showed the footage to a professional hypnotist and he said and I quote this is something we do every day and mr. Hin is a real professional well I was really by simply saying that these\n\n(1:36:46) manifestations do happen yet at the same time the real the divine is still there it didn't deny it now let's go a little step further and listen to this they play it again for you [Music] [Applause] is he saying come on people let me hear you praise the name of Satan let's try something else this is the believers voice of victory\n\n(1:37:44) broadcast today Gloria Copeland my wife will be concluding her series on the spirit of faith remember these signs that they make and how they say these things let's have a look at this interview with Larry King Larry King Live Mount Carmel Pennsylvania with pastor Benny Hinn hello yes good evening I believe that there are false prophets\n\n(1:38:10) out in the world today and we've seen the television evangelist who have fallen by the wayside no I was just wondering what it really separates mr. him from the other TV evangelists out there how do they know it's quite simple say Jesus said by the fruit she will know them and just watch the person's\n\n(1:38:30) fruit okay his own words watch the person's fruits what are his fruits let's ask him this is a video of a party held in his house various this man dies that night of an overdose of Herod heroin [Music] [Music] it's quite simple say jesus said by as she will know them and just watch the person's fruits if they display a clean\n\n(1:39:24) life Christian character if they show true Christianity then they're really for real [Music] it's interesting nothing happened to him thereafter are these people beyond law that they can be seen to hand out drugs that even lead to overdoses from the deaths of people nothing happened what else does he do do you literally believe\n\n(1:40:24) that someone has been resurrected on the program I have not seen it in that one case we did hear about it so in the one story he says I saw it I watched it and when cornered he says sorry I didn't I didn't see it I just heard about it what about healings correct you for the last time I do not say to the individual\n\n(1:40:52) you're healed they are telling me they've been here [Music] so he's lying one more thing this is his wife if your engine is not have enough you know what you need you need a Holy Ghost enema [Applause] did you hear what she said she said you need a Holy Ghost enema right up your rear end is that reverence for God so\n\n(1:41:33) these preachers say I am God these preachers use hypnosis on people these preachers do all the things that we would imagine people do when they want to deceive people I believe they are what are they wolves in sheep's clothing I believe that the top preaches many of them not all of them there are probably\n\n(1:42:01) many many sincere good people out there but many of them are planted or high inside a trained agents high up in Freemasonry trained by the Jesuit Order to deceive Protestantism into accepting a lie and to start adopting a human based needs religion rather than the religion of Jesus Christ this is an onslaught not\n\n(1:42:28) only against you and me this is an onslaught against Jesus Christ of the highest order it is sidetracking him and he's putting him where they want him in the dust and I believe it's time to stand up for Jesus Christ and these poor people that have been deceived it is time that people realized their only hope is Jesus\n\n(1:42:54) Christ and no one else only Jesus can save you but you have to admit that you need him and he will satisfy your needs non selfishly if you want him only because you need a need satisfied what kind of relationship is that how would you like to have a relationship with someone who comes to you only so that\n\n(1:43:22) you can satisfy one of his needs or her needs would you like that would you like to have a relationship with someone that has an ego trip because he's capable of filling a need some people are high on need filling they go and find all the weak people in the world and fill their needs and this gives them a kick nothing wrong with\n\n(1:43:48) helping the poor nothing wrong with all of that but if you so fix that person's attention on yourself that you become the great hero start rather than in humility helping someone then there's a problem I should be fixed on Jesus if you have a problem with that rather given help in secret then be praised by\n\n(1:44:15) men rather giving secret rather going put some money into somebody's mouth box whose poor and let no one know about it they're knocking on the door and say you know I can see you've got needs here they aren't people worship you and you feel great and they feel great maybe they feel even miserable who knows but\n\n(1:44:34) if they got it in the post box and they never knew they'd be surprised then they'd have no one to thank but whom God and who put the thought in your mind in any case to do good there's no one that does good no not one only Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life this is probably the greatest healer in the\n\n(1:44:57) world today bigger than Benny Hinn Benny Hinn doesn't on television this man they fly to him in jumbo jets TB Joshua I was sent to earth to save the world what arrogance he's another one like Benny Hinn who wears white here's his sign Jesus Christ hanging on the cross he has those Arabic words over there actually it says there is no deity\n\n(1:45:23) except Allah very interesting isn't that what Freemasonry doesn't its highest level the divine person in me can do a million things simultaneously I can appear to thousands of people in their dreams in any part of the world to set them free of their sickness problems and afflictions oh so now he's the needs\n\n(1:45:42) fellow he's the one who falls the needs you see it doesn't matter whether it's as blatantly diabolical as these things or whether it is in lawn mowing and nuts-and-bolts if you have someone that you want to help don't tell him that's Christianity tell him that your Lord installed you to help him your Lord made\n\n(1:46:08) you so that you want to help people but don't make that your religion your religion is Jesus Christ and my religion should be Jesus Christ there is no other this is his center and here come thousands and thousands of people to be healed he calls himself TB Joshua Joshua Yahweh the Savior and he likes to be addressed\n\n(1:46:28) as Emmanuel God with us these people are on an ego trip and the likes they have the song sung Emmanuel our God it's repeated over and over whilst driving out a demon Joshua asked the demon and Who am I and the demon answered you are Jesus the Christ Joshua laughed and called others and said to him here what does demon says I\n\n(1:46:51) Jesus the Christ well I don't like this video but I'll show it anyway [Music] speaking in tongues in the background this is a charismatic preacher very prominent one he brings all plane loads to TB Joshua [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this woman supposedly never walked in alive [Music]\n\n(1:48:17) I've seen enough did you see how she walked like this what did what happened when jesus healed someone he jumped up and jumped for joy and he was fully healed this is deception of the highest order 2nd thessalonians chapter 9 verse 11 reads the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of satan\n\n(1:48:45) displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those that are perishing they perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved what's the truth jesus is the way the truth and the life all thy commandments of truth thy law is truth\n\n(1:49:12) psalm 119 obedience and christ that is the way Jesus calls us to repentance and a walk with Him and then you know what even if you stayed crippled you have joy because you'll have life eternal and you will not be a on the other side for this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will\n\n(1:49:41) believe the lie this is God's permissive will this you must understand God's will is God's will God's permissive world God's ultimate world God permits it because they refuse to want him they want their needs folds leave me alone with your repentance just give me what I need and they are surf this up in a\n\n(1:50:04) package which is so delusionary that people believe it so that they will be condemned to have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness wolves in sheep's clothing for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all the churches of the saints 1 Corinthians 14 verse 33 I would like to\n\n(1:50:30) make peel there we serve Jesus Christ in righteousness and in truth there we look at our own hearts and say am I really a good wonderful person or have I got faults is there one here who has not sinned is there one here who has never done anything that needs forgiveness is there anyone here who has not suppressed\n\n(1:50:58) someone else for his own purposes is there anyone here who has not manipulated someone else for his own purposes I doubt it we all need the Spirit of Jesus Christ total unselfish love only Jesus can give it and when I come to church I come to church because I'm grateful and I'm grateful to Jesus and I come to church not to have my\n\n(1:51:28) needs for I don't want to be a bread and fish Christian bread and fish God will provide if I serve Him seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and my God shall take care of all your needs I've had many times of poverty in my own life I've been in situations\n\n(1:51:51) where I've literally faced death by violence many times people who don't live in my country don't even understand that but I know what it means to trust God I've learnt it by experience and I know he comes through every time he has a bad habit of coming through in the last second but he comes through every\n\n(1:52:13) single time and why does he allow things to go to the last second so we learn to trust him no matter what the situation you know what I've come to love his character he never ever forced me to do anything never ever ever in all my life as Jesus Christ forced me to do anything never that is why if I should ever have\n\n(1:52:38) the privilege of kneeling before him I would take the crown and throw it at his feet why because I don't deserve it he deserves it and what will he do he says now you have it and it will never remind me of anything that he did for me salvation in Christ is so complete that we stand one day before God as though we\n\n(1:53:03) had never sinned our sin will be removed from us as far as the East is from the West if you ask him what have I done issues I can't remember we will never feel like nothing when we are with Christ we will be sons and daughters of God free agents but obedient and submissive to him by our choice because of his character and\n\n(1:53:31) if we can understand that what life we would have in our churches what beautiful worship we would have in our churches we wouldn't come to church arguing about whether we one country and Rock Country and Western rock or heavy metal or this that or the other no no no we would come to church fold with a love\n\n(1:53:52) for Jesus Christ to say thank you to him for all his blessings if only Christianity could take hold of him once again and get rid of all the lies what a revival we will see may God bless you and keep you as you ponder these things amen [Music] [Music] [Music]",
  "# Title:226_the_un_the_occult_agenda_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nUnited Nations' Agenda,One World Religion,Occult Influence,Global Education,Biblical Prophecy\n\n## Guide:\nThe provided source, an excerpt from Walter Veith's \"The UN & the Occult Agenda,\" asserts that the United Nations, despite its public image as a peace-promoting political organization, harbors a hidden occult and luciferian agenda. Veith argues that the UN's origins and ongoing operations are deeply influenced by secret societies and New Age philosophy, aiming to establish a one-world government and a unified global religion. Key figures in the UN's history, from its founders to its secretaries-general, are presented as proponents of socialist, Marxist, or even occult beliefs, specifically citing the influence of Jesuit priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, who envisioned humanity merging into godhood. The source further highlights the Robert Muller School's \"World Core Curriculum,\" based on the writings of Alice A. Bailey (initially published by Lucifer Publishing Company), as evidence of the UN's intent to reshape global education to undermine individualism, patriotism, and traditional religious dogmas, preparing the world for the coming of a \"cosmic Christ\" who is not Jesus, but Lucifer.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 226 The UN & the Occult Agenda Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvUqRGPOh_8\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] you [Music] when we think about the united nations then we think about exactly that an organization a political organization bringing the nations together and that sounds like something commendable and the question is is that all that there is behind it do you remember that at the tower of\n\n(01:30) babel god separated the nations now if you look at the headquarters of the united nations in new york this is really quite a fascinating building it is large and the name united nations was coined by united states president franklin d roosevelt and was used in the declaration by united nations of january 1942\n\n(02:00) during the second world war when representatives of 26 nations pledged their governments to continue fighting together against what they call the axis powers interesting name axis powers today there's another axis that is being fought and that is known as the axis of evil have you heard of that the forerunner of the united nations was\n\n(02:25) the league of nations and this was an organization in similar circumstances during the first world war and established in 1919 under the treaty of versailles to promote the international cooperation and to achieve peace and security this comes straight from the un webpage so nothing strange about that\n\n(02:45) it's just plain history some more from that in 1945 representatives of 50 countries met in san francisco at the united nations conference on international organizations and they drew up a united nations charter and those delegates deliberated on the basis of proposals worked out by representatives of\n\n(03:08) china soviet union united kingdom united states at dumbarton oaks united states in august october 1944 it was signed on 26 june 1945 50 countries poland was not represented and became one of the original 51 member states so it officially came into existence on the 24th of october 1945 when the charter was ratified by china\n\n(03:39) france soviet union united kingdom united states and by a majority of the other signatories and every 24th of october they celebrate this founding of the united nations now let's have a look at this charter of the united nations this is a very interesting piece of history well arthur balfour do you remember that\n\n(04:06) name we've used it before who was a member of horts apostles you remember hort this was the professor that helped to produce the greek text that changed the emphasis of the bible and removed many of the aspects of jesus christ's power and sovereignty from the word of god and the apostles were the secret society\n\n(04:34) that uh functioned and at that time and hort was a member as well as arthur balfour hort called this group a senior apostles club as well as president of the psychic research society society for psychic research soon became prime minister of england arthur belfort and instrumental in the first league of nations\n\n(04:58) so this president this prime minister was also of course active in the writing of the original charter of the league of nations much of which formed the basis for the united nations he not only headed the society for psychic research holding seances at his home but he initiated a group called the synthetic society\n\n(05:21) whose goal was to create a one world religion that's a very interesting point of history and he invited a certain frederick meyers of the society of psychic research to join and together they created the preamble of all religions and it includes the dogma departed spirits can communicate obviously if you belong to such a\n\n(05:44) society then that is part of the situation so built in somewhere over there was the wish to bring all religions together now let's have a look at some of the historic figures of the united nations al gehes he became the acting secretary general of the establishment of the united nations the april 16 1945 issue of time magazine\n\n(06:12) called him one of the state department's brighter young men it was his and joseph e johnson who later became secretary of the boulder burgers so here we have all the secret societies again who wrote much of the united nations charter so very high freemasons bilderbergers were responsible for this charter now we know what they believe\n\n(06:34) we've already had a lecture on that and i would refer people back to that lecture patterning it after the constitution of russia and the communist manifesto this is very interesting so the constitution of the ussr is almost identical to the constitution of the united nations for those who did not know that and there are\n\n(06:57) all the references everything that i say is referenced i'm just reading so please nobody get angry with me get angry if you want to with whoever set this thing up i had nothing to do with it winston churchill the creation of an authoritative world order is the ultimate aim to watch which we must strive and the united\n\n(07:17) nations formed part of that charles de gaulle who was also instrumental nations must unite in a world government or perish so the big figures involved had this philosophy then there is a man i don't know how to pronounce his name trigger li the first official un secretary general was a high-ranking member of norway's\n\n(07:40) social democratic party which was by the way an offshoot of the third communist international and then came a man doug hamascott and he was the second secretary general he was a swedish socialist he openly pushed communist policy and then came utant the third secretary general and he was a marxist so here you can see\n\n(08:04) how the philosophy in the beginning was programmed now i would like you to understand that this is not a method to go anti-capitalist because the united states was a signatory of this charter so why would the united states actually sign something that was so obviously contrary to their own philosophy\n\n(08:26) well if you remember the hegelian principle where two opposing viewpoints are set into the world and neither of them is really the viewpoint you want to achieve what you really want to achieve is a synthesis between the two so what you see actually is you see socialists in the overriding capacity of secretary\n\n(08:54) generals although whether they have marxist leanings or capitalist leanings at that level doesn't make any difference the method is just to bring about a synthesis which is the desired government of all of them so out of this chaos you eventually get whatever you want now yutant he was of course one of the earliest\n\n(09:17) secretary generals he said world federalists held before us the vision of a united man unified mankind living in peace under just world order the heart of the program a world under law is realistic and attainable just to remind you of what we have said before and of course behind the scenes always you have the papacy\n\n(09:42) as you can see in all of these lectures the papacy always very heavily involved here is pope paul vi with secretary general yutant now this man was a marxist or let's rather put it this way publicly he pushed a marxist agenda but if he was a true insider then he had neither agenda and this was just for an appearance sake as hegel also\n\n(10:14) said so it is not surprising that here we have a handshake with another secretary gen gen uh general whose name was walteim now what was the agenda or what was the political view of valdem anybody know he was nazi yes so you can see that hegelian philosophy coming out here there you have marxism antithesis there you have\n\n(10:47) narcissism thesis in between synthesis so it didn't really matter which of the philosophies they espoused as long as the end result was the same pope paul vi by the way is the first one to introduce this bent cross or broken cross let's read about what this means pope paul vi wrote a papal encyclical that called on\n\n(11:11) the nations to abandon sovereignty to form a world government so the pope himself was behind this and actually called for such a government and about this twisted cross here's the quote for you paul vi made use of a sinister symbol used by satanists in the 6th century that had been revived at the time of\n\n(11:36) vatican 2 this was a bent or broken cross on which was displayed a repulsive and distorted figure of christ which the black magicians and sorcerers of the middle ages had made use of to represent the biblical term mark of the beast interesting quote yet not only paul vi but his successor the two john paul's carried that object\n\n(12:00) and held it up to be revered by the crowds who had not the slightest idea that it stood for antichrist so that's a quote that's very interesting about the broken cross and what it stands for so these are the figures behind or the movers of the united nations a pope calling for such an order the secretary general's picking it\n\n(12:25) up reiterating it on both sides of the political divide so that it would seem fair to both sides of the philosophy now what about the spiritual aspect there's one interfaith organization that is called the temple of understanding and it has a newsletter which is called world goodwill newsletter founded by\n\n(12:51) juliet hollister in 1960 the temple of understanding has one of its goals the creation of a spiritual united nations in its work to promote understanding between religions on the basis of the oneness of the human family sounds good the temple is numbered among its members and supporters such influential world\n\n(13:12) service as a utah himself well there's the secretary general you can't go much higher than that eleanor roosevelt that's interesting thomas merton yavronero anwa sadat radhakrishnan in addition to the main center of new york so these are the top movers so this is not sun sort of little organization operating somewhere\n\n(13:37) in the wings this is a hub organization and from where did they operate well they were based at the cathedral of saint john the divine that must be getting pretty boring by now right always the same thing the temple has active chapters in india in the uk representatives in africa latin america asia middle east this is\n\n(13:59) a universal movement to bring all religions together now let's have a look at this interesting cathedral there it is the cathedral of saint john the divine the cathedral is located at the 112th street in amsterdam avenue one block east of broadway the largest cathedral in the world that's also interesting the cathedral\n\n(14:23) church of saint john the divine in new york is the mother church of the episcopal diocese of new york and the seat of its bishop remember that's where they had the female christ and where they have the issue of ordaining homosexual bishops and all kinds of interesting stuff happen at this episcospipe\n\n(14:46) right a little bit more history jim garrison president of the new age gorbachev foundation which was this foundation that was founded by gorbachev in new york he said we are going to end up with the world government it's inevitable there's going to be conflict coercion and consensus that's all part of what will be required\n\n(15:10) as we give birth to the first global civilization so that's the agenda that they have philip jessup a cfr member world court justice pretty high up people right i agree that national sovereignty is the root of all evil so nations will obviously have to relinquish their sovereignty to this organization without it\n\n(15:35) appearing as if they are doing so the humanist manifesto two states we deplore the division of mankind on nationalistic grounds we have reached a turning point in human history where the best option to transcend the limits of national sovereignty and to be moved towards building a world community that's humanist manifesto\n\n(15:57) one and two these are the official documents now this is a very interesting man robert mueller he's the former assistant secretary general to the united nations but he is today the mover in the spiritual field within the united nations he's also called the prophet of hope of the united nations he wrote we must\n\n(16:22) move as quickly as possible to a one world government a one world religion under a one world leader that's very very interesting so these are the top movers now the philosophy i'm always interested in what the philosophy is and who's behind it and again we pick up the same old names over and over and\n\n(16:46) over again in the aquarian conspiracy by marilyn ferguson ferguson a survey of new ages showed that the leading influence on their spiritual awakening was again pierre talhar de chardin do you remember who he was jesuit priest you see they have catholicism the jesuits the top movers in the united nations now what did\n\n(17:12) robert mueller the former assistant secretary general have to say he wrote talhah deshardin had always viewed the united nations as the progressive institution tuitional embodiment of his philosophy now there is a secretary general sang or under secretary general saying that the united nations embodies the\n\n(17:38) philosophy of tailheart chardin now what did tile heart say i've mentioned some of his philosophy we'll look in a little bit more detail again thailand wrote although the form is not neces not yet discernible mankind tomorrow will awaken to a pan organized world pan organized world well okay what else do\n\n(18:04) you have to say thaila de chardin influenced his companion father the brevi who inspired colleagues who started rich process of global and long-term thinking in the united nations which affected many nations and people around the world robert mueller says i have myself been deeply influenced by thailand so\n\n(18:28) the under secretary general of the united nations who's today entrusted with the spiritual aspects of the united nations plus its education program says he's influenced by tylhart deshardine and robert miller writes most of all they taught me happiness his work he says any tile hardian will recognize in this the spiritual\n\n(18:50) transcendence which he announced so emphatically as the next step in our evolution so there's going to be a spiritual transcendence from what appears to be political over to the spiritual all right we've already seen in a previous lecture that he was a french jesuit priest the eugenist the marxist the pantheist the evolutionist\n\n(19:15) he might have even been involved in the pultan hoax he was a humanist and a proponent of a one-world government and he's the father of the new age so he's a very prominent man seems to have been very busy he dreamed of humanity merging into god and each realizing his own godhood at the amiga point this belief has inspired\n\n(19:35) many of the new age leaders in fact chardin is one of the most frequently quoted writers by leading new age occultists that we've had too when we discuss the new age movement but just to remind you so we can merge into gods this is what the man looks like this comes straight from the jesuit webpages themselves and\n\n(19:57) they'll talk about his evolutionary synthesis world of the mind and spirit physical world with the world of mind and spirit the union of those and uh here are a few of his quotes just to go into a little bit of detail this is the spirit of the philosophy of the united nations interesting it is a law of the universe\n\n(20:19) that in all things there is prior existence before every form there is a prior but lesser evolved form each one of us is evolving towards godhead so we are all becoming god wonderful philosophy what i am proposing to do is to narrow that gap between pantheism and christianity by bringing out what one might call the\n\n(20:46) christian soul of pantheism or the pantheist aspect of christianity that's fascinating so god is in everything god is not a separate entity we ourselves are god or part of god if you are a pantheist that's what you believe i can be saved only by becoming one with the universe that's pantheism it's also the philosophy of buddhism i\n\n(21:15) believe the messiah whom we await whom we all without any doubt await is the universal christ that is to say the christ of evolution but that's tyler de jadin's philosophy isn't that interesting so unfortunately i cannot agree with one single iota of that philosophy it's not biblical in fact it's blasphemous\n\n(21:44) a general convergence of religions upon a universal christ who satisfied them all that's what tyler de chardin said christianity and evolution that's his quote his quote so a convergence of religion that satisfies them all and he saw the united nations as the embodiment of this philosophy that seems to me the\n\n(22:05) only possible conversion of the world and the only form in which a religion of the future can be conceived that means everybody must come together now how do you get all the religions to come together and to bury the hatchets and their differences you create a pain of separation chaos that exceeds the pain\n\n(22:31) of unity is that understandable that's how you do it that's hegelian philosophy that is freemason philosophy so today we're in the pain stage and the next phase will be unity or an inexplicable pain that's the choice a mankind will quite readily choose which one the lesser pain obviously to survive now let's have a\n\n(22:59) look at all these secretary generals and whether they are actually embodying this philosophy or not this is doug he was the secretary general of the united nations from 10 april 1953 to 1961 then he met his death in a plane crash and he was the fourth son of the prime minister of sweden during the years of world war one\n\n(23:28) he was the first one now what did he do in the united nations well one of the first things he did was to produce or create a prayer room and there it is on the left hand side a stone in the middle of the rumors place to tell us we may see it as an altar empty not because there is no god not because it is an altar to an unknown\n\n(23:50) god but because it is dedicated to the god who man worships under many names and many forms very interesting so there is this prayer room with only this stone altar which is built to be shaped like a like a rectangle if you like which has certain interesting meanings and the whole building the whole room has the shape of\n\n(24:17) a trapezoid now what does that mean well there's also an all-seeing eye and that symbol that we see over here in amongst the hittites is also the symbol if you look carefully of the united nations which has the laurel wreath and which has the face up there which is just replaced with the earth now perhaps the best way to comprehend\n\n(24:41) what the all-seeing eye represents is to examine the architecture of the meditation room of the united nations building in new york the meditation room is shaped as a pyramid a trapezoid without the capstone inside the room is dimly lit but coming from the ceiling is a narrow but concentrated pinpoint\n\n(25:00) beam of light which radiates down to a bleak stone altar on the wall straight ahead is a breathtaking modernistic mural that is dynamically endowed with occult symbolism containing 27 triangles and various configurations a mixture of black and white and coloured background and a snake-like vertical line at the\n\n(25:22) center is the all-seeing eye which grips the millions of annual un visitors with its stock beckoning image of suspicion and omnipresence this is the quote from tex mars and some more quotes the meditation room faces north northeast to enter the room one must proceed from darkness into light indeed the middle order of the satanic\n\n(25:46) brotherhood is called the order of the trapezoid that's very interesting and anton levay who is the founder of the church of satan refers to an occult principle known as the law of the trapezoid so we seem to have a very occult room here which is dedicated to a god that can be served under any name the one that i know has one name\n\n(26:14) one name one could tell several moving stories right robert mueller the spiritual godfather if you like of the united nations and the former under secretary general one could tell several moving stories of the spiritual transformation of the united nations has caused to the point that this little speck on earth is\n\n(26:35) becoming holy grounds for example the rational intellectual economist doug hamascott found guard at the united nations and inspiration for his work as a world servant in the mystics of the middle ages oh so we didn't find it from the bible he found it where from the mystics towards the end of his markings overflow with spirituality and\n\n(27:02) mysticism they are the words of the united nations themselves or their representatives telling us how this inspiration came about now let's go back a little bit to foster and alice bailey these were alice a bailey the one who received dictated messages from dual cool and who is known as the prophetess of\n\n(27:27) the new age they started a group called world goodwill an official non-governmental organization within the united nations the stated aim of this group is to cooperate in the world of preparation for the reappearance of the christ so the united nations in other words is an organization preparing to get\n\n(27:52) all the religion all the governments together yes but that is just on a political level the agenda behind it is to bring all the religions together and to prepare it for the coming of christ which christ not jesus christ but the cosmic christ because jesus christ is not coming as we will see in a future lecture\n\n(28:20) to do what they think is going to happen their christ wants to have a kingdom here on earth but god says my kingdom is not of this earth now let's have a look at this man robert mueller there he is dr robert miller former assistant secretary general of the united nations chancellor of the united nations\n\n(28:41) university of peace and he's chairperson of the peace party 2000 he's a very prominent man what is he right robert mueller decide to open yourself to god to the universe to all your brethren and sisters to your inner self to the potential of the human race to the infinity of your inner self and you will become the universe you\n\n(29:06) will become infinity and you will at long last your you will be at long lost your real divine stupendous self then you have the same philosophy so what is he saying that we can become gods all right so that is the mover and the shaker of the philosophy of the united nations robert miller writes in world core\n\n(29:35) curriculum the following now this is stunning the underlying philosophy upon which the robert mueller's school now what is the robert miller school we'll have to come to that robin miller school is the education program for the entire world as will be enforced by the united nations that's scary let's read on\n\n(30:00) the underlying philosophy upon which the robert miller school is based will be found in the teaching set forth in the books of alisa bailey hello the books of alice a bailey were published originally by lucifer publishing company which because of all the flack they changed to lucis trust isn't that correct the school is now\n\n(30:24) certified as a united nations associated school providing education for international cooperation and peace okay this is big business so the philosophy is based on luciferian channeled writings preparing for the coming of lucifer and remember what they said they were quite open about it alissa bailey\n\n(30:50) evidence of the growth of human intellect along the needed receptive lines for the preparation of the new age can be seen in the planning of various nations and in the efforts of the united nations to formulate a world plan from the very start of this involvement three occult factors have governed the\n\n(31:10) development of all these plans now can you see why i call the lecture the un and the occult agenda because alisa bailey says there were three occult plans and robert mueller says yes we follow the writings of lsa bailly she did not spell them out but she did state within the united nations is a germ and seed of a great\n\n(31:34) international and meditating reflective group a group of thinking and informed men and women in whose hands lies the destiny of humanity this is largely under the control of many fostered disciples if you could but realize it and their point of meditative focus is the intuitional or buddhic plane the plane upon which\n\n(32:02) all hierarchical activity is today to be found that's about as occult as you can get what she is saying is that the inner core of the united nations is controlled by people who are under the control of lucifer that's what you're saying she's saying it's demonic and it's out of her words not mine i'm\n\n(32:23) just reading that's what's such fun about all of this helena petrovna blavatsky founder of theosophy she was the forerunner of course of the bailly books and theosophy was then taken over by annie ward basant over here and then taken over by alice a bailey and here is the great invocation that has to be\n\n(32:45) read and learnt by every child in the future from the point of light within the mind of god let light stream forth into the minds of men let light descend on earth from the point of love within the heart of god let love stream forth into the hearts of men may christ return to earth but this christ is not jesus christ\n\n(33:05) from the center where the will of god is known let purpose guide the little wills of men oh how neat it's so derogatory the purpose which the masters know and serve what arrogance from the center which we call the race of men let the plan of love and light work out and may it seal the door where evil\n\n(33:27) dwells this is interesting which door is to be sealed where evil dwells well if you know occult science you'll know that they call light darkness and darkness light and they say that jesus is the evil one we read all those quotes when we did the lecture on that issue made sealed at all where evil dwells let light and love and\n\n(33:50) power restore the plan on earth restore what plan restore whose plan and who made it so that it is not restored well who separated the nations god separated the nations what is the focus of the united nations to unite the nations so they want to restore that which the inadvertent commas evil one happened to mess up with one brilliant\n\n(34:25) move of confusing the languages well just goes to show one word of god and is confused for four and a half thousand years who's really in control here well here's annie bassant in her 33 degree freemason regalia co masonry you remember we dealt with this issue the theosophy textbook teaches immortality\n\n(34:48) reincarnation the deity of man statements by this dwalkul who also inspired alice bailey he says talks about alice a bailly no me still by another name in office a a b alice a bailey knows who i am and recognizes me by two of my names now that's interesting because there are two names and we will see the two names in a future lecture\n\n(35:17) what the names are and then it gets very interesting this is a detective story it's a very exciting one well the bible says they are spirits of demons working miracles which go forth to the kings of the earth and to the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great great day of god almighty\n\n(35:37) revelation 16 14. remember that helena petrovna blavatsky the founder of this movement of which alice a bailey became the high priestess if you like said lucifer represents life thought progress civilization liberty independence lucifer is the logos the serpent the savior it is satan who is the god of our planet\n\n(36:02) and the only one then she talks about the virgin who is satan and lucifer at the same time and the holy ghost all wrapped in one so whether you call him isis or whether you call him osiris doesn't matter whether you call him bale and ashteret doesn't matter two names he always comes under two names two principles\n\n(36:23) alice a bailey she succeeded besant as leader of theosophy her husband was a 32 degree freemason and also of course part of co-masonry there she is priestess and prophetess of the new aids movement who received these messages from this spirit entity which has to be a demon dwaal ko writings as we have said\n\n(36:49) one of two women to be one of the most prolific writers of modern times her main aim the problems of humanity getting all humanity together again and preparing the world for the coming of christ and we have read this quote already i dedicate myself anew to the service of the coming one one is an acroman in the occult for\n\n(37:12) lucifer and will do all i can to prepare men's minds and hearts for that event i have no other life intention she writes the tibetan this is now this dual cool has asked me to make clear that when he is speaking of the christ he is referring to his official name as head of the hierarchy the christ works for all men\n\n(37:36) irrespective of their faith he does not belong to the christian world any more than to the buddhist or or any other faith there is no need for any man to join the christian church in order to be affiliated with christ so obviously it's not christianity the requirements are to love your fellow men lead a disciplined life\n\n(37:58) recognize the divinity in all faiths and all beings and rule your daily life with love first of all he will come to a world which is essentially one world alissa bailey wrote so it doesn't even have to be a fully united world the major effect of his appearance will surely be to demonstrate in every land\n\n(38:20) the effect of a spirit of inclusiveness now i want you to ponder this this is very important so his main aim will be to develop a spirit of inclusiveness an inclusiveness which will be channeled or expressed through him so his spirit will work to bring this about all who seek right human relations will\n\n(38:47) be gathered automatically to him ah so not all who seek jesus christ know all who seek right human relations can you see the emphasis to mankind again all who seek these will automatically be gathered to him whether they are in one of the great world religions or not so we need a spirit of inclusiveness\n\n(39:09) but let's continue all who see no true or basic difference between religion and religion or between man and man or nation and nation will rally around him now those who embody the spirit of exclusiveness and separateness will stand automatically and equally revealed and all men will know them for what they are\n\n(39:36) oh nice what does the bible say on this issue the bible says come out and be separate the bible asks for a spirit of separateness the united nations by its very nature has no option but to ask for a spirit of inclusiveness but now what if the high movers behind the scenes are actually occultists and luciferians\n\n(40:12) wouldn't that be kind of scary because who would be the head honcho of the team then behind the scenes satan satan would be the head honcho he would be the main guy now the trouble is this difference those who say come out and be separate they're going to be in trouble those who say well let's be inclusive\n\n(40:35) they'll be okay the reply comes with clarity he will come unfailingly when a measure of peace has been restored we don't have to have world peace just a measure of peace allah say bailey continues the major required preparation for the coming of the christ is a world at peace however that peace must be\n\n(40:53) based on an educated goodwill which will lead inevitably to right human relations and therefore to the establishments of on lines of light between nation and nation religion and religion group and group man and man so the only way we're going to have this community is by putting everybody into the melting pot\n\n(41:15) and becoming one that means giving up your differences discover the members of the new group of world service whenever possible and strengthen their hands look for them in every nation and expressing expressing many lines of thoughts and points of view remember always that in doctrine and dogma and in\n\n(41:34) techniques and methods they may differ widely from you but in love for their fellow man that has become the religion of the new world not love for god love for the fellow man in practical goodwill and in devotion to the establishment of right human relations they stand with you they are your equals and can\n\n(41:52) probably teach you much so forget all about the religious differences promote ceaselessly the work of world goodwill so that every nation may have its own group of men and women dedicated to the establishment of right human relationships the whole power has to shift to man rather than to god it is on the\n\n(42:14) foundation of this teaching that christ will raise the superstructure of the brotherhood of man for right human relations on expression of the love of god and this is all we hear in the sermonizing of the new world what is important is right human relations what is important is that we accept one another as we are\n\n(42:36) what we and it goes on and on and on and on but faithfulness to god biblical principles no they have to be given up share international says but the day will dawn when the vision of the united nations will save the world and when the reality of the united nations starts bearing fruit then the breath of immortality will be a\n\n(43:00) living reality on earth and there is the spiritual leader of the or the present priest if you like in the united nations the hindu sri chemnoy he says the united nations is the way the way to oneness that leads to the supreme oneness capitalized it is like a river flowing towards the source the ultimate source\n\n(43:23) and the united nations becomes for us the answer to world suffering world darkness world ignorance the inner vision of the united nations is the gift supreme and this will be realized no matter how many years it takes the dalai lama says in the sphere of international relations the sense of greater shared\n\n(43:39) responsibility is particularly needed today when the world is becoming increasingly interdependent the dangers of irresponsible behavior have dramatically increased unless we realize that we now are part of one big human family we cannot hope to bring about peace and happiness so all the world leaders\n\n(44:00) are saying these things and the united nations with its symbolism of this ancient laurel wreath around a globe is nothing other than the emulation of an old pagan ideal which lucifer once more wants to realize in the world that we live in today as we have seen the symbol of the united nations is very similar to the old hittite\n\n(44:28) symbol where you had in the center the face of the sun god and now you just have a web if you like a spider's whip which is the symbol of lucifer and the encompassing earth and of course the lara wreath was a symbol of all the ancient deities so we find all for one all together now we are the world was the 50th celebration\n\n(44:58) of the united nations the new age agenda was to merge god and nature that's what tyler de chardin the father of the philosophy of the un said we must become pantheistic eradicate male female distinction world peace nuclear disarmament one world government one world religion the organizations leading up to this the\n\n(45:22) united nations of course council of foreign relations trilateral commission bilderbergers gorbachev foundation and the club of rome and they've already put up a constitution which is known as the constitution for the federation of earth so we really have a world constitution now obviously if you want to bring about\n\n(45:42) the situation like that you have to influence the education of the world so that the mindset and the thinking of people is changed so education is a very important point this comes straight from their own web pages well you cannot say this is hearsay it comes straight from them you know.org the world will not\n\n(46:03) change and find peace if there is not a new education utah former secretary general of the united nations we need a new education the old ones no good the former director of the world health organization dr brock chisholm of course that's also a united nations organization says to achieve world government it is\n\n(46:22) necessary to remove from the minds of men their individualism that's kind of scary don't you think loyalty to family traditions oh that's even worse national patriotism and religions dogmas now these are the movers of the united nations your individualism must go you must become a number just doing what\n\n(46:46) the state says this marxism the state is supreme and you are nothing but the catechumen a or nothing and you must give up your individuality now let's have a look again at this man robert mueller philosopher prophet of hope top level global statesman and what a mighty man he's the chancellor of the university of peace created by\n\n(47:10) the united nations he is the creator of what is known as the world core curriculum that says everything and he's known throughout as the world as the father of global education there are 29 robert miller schools around the world more being established each year world core curriculum earned him the unesco peace prize in\n\n(47:32) 1989 he has recently drawn up a framework for world media coverage what you see on your television is what you're supposed to see not what you should see as a public service as well as a framework for planetary and cosmic consciousness wow so your mindset your cultural mindset must be changed your framework\n\n(47:55) for the arts and culture these are our cultures speaking after all he said so himself he says he follows alice bailey is the author of the world core curriculums what does that do everything is a quote steer our children towards global citizenship earth-centered belief socialist values the collective mindset\n\n(48:15) which is becoming a requirement of the 20th century workforce your children will have to be modified we are living in a frightening world as robert mueller what does he write about a world core curriculum he says a world called curriculum might seem utopian today but by the end of the year 2000 have we\n\n(48:40) passed that yes it will be down to earth daily reality in what does it say there all the schools of the world now i believe you me i have been in the education system i officially left the education system one month ago and what i have seen in the last few years the changes are hair racing hair raising if that\n\n(49:06) is what is awaiting us then god help this world we've already seen he says the philosophy is based on alice a bailey and world core curriculum this is unil.org that is their own one what is their teaching our planetary home place in the universe our place in time that's all the evolution stories the family of humanity that's\n\n(49:32) global humanity the miracle of individual life and the coordinating centers of the world where they all are the robert mueller schools international what do they teach well they teach they have for example the shaman institute and they have all these nice interesting occult signs for all the things that they stand for\n\n(49:55) ellucis the all-seeing eyes humanistic psychology this is one of the robert miller school's teaching points here is franco a shamanic facilitator astrology sacred circle operator author of initiation and astral shamanism he talks to inner guides what else he says the workshop offers practical tools for journeying into\n\n(50:19) ecstatic dimensions beyond conventional time he says the program includes shamanic journeys drumming ceremonial sharing soul retrieving connection with guides and spirits the spiritism of the worst kind this is forbidden in the bible no wonder the bible is not part of this organization's book robert mueller says\n\n(50:42) at the world level the un has adopted a world economic development strategy food agriculture well there's a world food plan a world health plan a world literacy plan a world employment plan a world industry plan they've got every single detail of our lives sewn up now another organization that's very\n\n(51:05) important is unesco and let's just look at unesco it's the sub organization of the united nations julian huxley is the former director of unesco he was humanist of the year he's a theistic philosopher member of the communistic colonial bureau of british fabian society and signer of the humanist manifesto too\n\n(51:29) that's not a very good recommendation as far as i'm concerned some more skull bones member archibald maglish wrote the unesco constitution so he must be an illuminati member as we saw in that lecture on the secret behind secret societies so freemasons helped create the organization a fervent international\n\n(51:51) maglish he is associated with one worldlism here's another one nibur is unesco's co-founder and he signed siekos now what does that mean which appeared in 1969 and uh they printed it in the new york times then what is siekos this is these are the founders it is the position of siecos that contraceptive services should be\n\n(52:17) available to all including miners who should enjoy the same rights of free and independent access to contraceptive care as do others it is the position of siecos that the use of explicit sexual materials sometimes referred to as pornography can serve a variety of important needs in the lives of countless individuals\n\n(52:36) these are nice people up there in the united nations no wonder now it is forced curriculum at even junior schools to have explicit sexual details explained all in the names of preventing sexual diseases with the most strange and lured acts which have to be performed in fact our universities are granting\n\n(53:00) honorary doctorates to those who are the most perverse on the stage yes huxley who was the initial chairman in its educational program can stress the ultimate need for world political unity familiarize all people with the implications of transfer of full sovereignty and etc etc so these people are all\n\n(53:23) birds of a feather unesco explains if unesco is attacked on the ground that it is helping to prepare the world's people for world government then it is an error to burst forth with apologetic statements and denials let us face it the job of unesco is to help create and promote the elements of world citizenship\n\n(53:42) when faced with such a charge let us by all means a firm eat from the housetops that's what unesco says itself so they're not denying anything under huxley's guidance they prepared a guide book for teachers now i would like the parents to take a note everybody with little children or have children with little children\n\n(54:02) take notes what is the united nations guidebook for teachers it says reminds them that the destruction of a child's love of country and patriotism is the first step in educating that child for world citizenship now let's have a look at what the guidebook contains volume 5 page on the opening page in the classroom\n\n(54:26) with children under 13 years of age before the child enters school his mind has already been profoundly marked often injuriously by earlier influences first gained however dimly in the home oh that's interesting so this must be changed who is putting these thoughts into the minds of children then the parents that must be changed so\n\n(54:53) unesco's aim is to change the mindset of your children to turn it against any values that the parents might instill in the mind of that child isn't that breaking the fifth commandment yes or no honor your father and your mother that you may have a long life isn't this breaking the fifth commandment i think it is\n\n(55:14) on page eight the teacher is told the kindergarten or infant school has a significant part to play in the child's education not only can it correct many of the eras of home training but can also prepare the child for membership at about age seven in a group of his own ancient habits the first of many such social\n\n(55:33) identifications that he must achieve on his way to membership in a world society aha the kindergarten so now the governments of the world are saying you must send your kids to school earlier did you know that at the governments are beginning to say that and england now passed a rule when this year this very year guess when kids\n\n(55:58) go to school from this year onwards in england age three yes age three you have to send them to preschool that's nice and the mothers love it because they don't have to take care of the kids but who's controlling the mindset of the kids and who's behind it occultists page 58 of the guide book to teachers\n\n(56:21) says as we have pointed out it is frequently the family that infects the child with extreme nationalism the school should therefore use the means described earlier to combat family attitudes now nationalism is not their ultimate game what is their real game religion religion volume 5 page 11 in our view history\n\n(56:44) and geography should be taught at this age at a universal history and geography the study of history raises problems of value which are better postponed until the pupil is freed from nationalist prejudice which is presence around the teaching of history so the whole mindset of the child must be changed\n\n(57:02) in the teaching program and this is unesco's aim not a very well noble aim i don't think because the authority of religion and parents especially christian religion will be undermined now another organization comes in this is called the finnhorn organization and they promote ecological health and prosperity have you heard\n\n(57:25) much about ecology in the world today yes now again we have to find the links you always have to do some detective work because francis this is francis of assisi connected with nature pope john paul ii named him the patron saint of ecology now saint francis was the roommate of ignatius lyola the jesuit founder just\n\n(57:47) went for a sec it is on saint francis day that thousands of people flocked to saint john the divine uh how boring cathedral for the blessing of the beasts also occultist robert miller that's now the secret under secretary general of the united nations former one informs us that francis has been declared patron saint of the united\n\n(58:09) nations the pope does it united nations follows who's really in control the pope there he is if you want to you can pray to him if you don't want to you can ignore it the u.n secretary general youth hunt formed the organization planetary citizens with new age activist donald keyes now we're getting the links there's the\n\n(58:32) top man the united nations with donald keys planetary citizen is now a global government organization within the un specifically devoted to preparing people for the coming of a new culture now let's go on with donald keyes he's together with utah donald keyes has been actively involved in finn horn have you got the link united nations\n\n(58:54) secretary general yutant donald keys finhon in scotland and writes regularly for its magazine one earth keys wrote the new age groups are focusing on entering a new stage a world-related stage they are becoming mature enough to begin to shoulder some of the load of humanity's burdens the spread of new age values as unifying\n\n(59:14) yeast in the human loaf may be the critical ingredient for successful emergence from the 1980s onwards now let's see what finhon is all about here we go their logo is the flame of lucifer they use are called symbols they use the lotus flower they talk about divinely ordinary divinely human so what are they saying\n\n(59:37) we're god and god spoke to me now who's that god that speaks to them well let's ask their spokesman this is david spangler there's one of his books parents as parent as mystic mystic as parent so this is what your education is going to do to your kids do you know that david spangler co-director spokesperson\n\n(59:59) for finon community in northern scotland that's what it looks like today let's see what he says he writes in the reflections of christ the true light of lucifer cannot be seen through sorrow through darkness through the rejection the true light of this great being can only be recognized when one's own\n\n(1:00:15) eyes can see with the light of the christ the light of the inner sun lucifer works within each one of us to bring us to wholeness and as we move into the new age which is the age of man's wholeness they love that word wholeness each of us in some ways brought to the point which is termed lucifer which are termed luciferic\n\n(1:00:36) initiation the particular doorway through which the individual must pass if he is to come fully into the presence of his light and wholeness lucifer comes to give us the final gift of wholeness so who are these people actually worshiping lucifer directly lucifer prepares man in all ways for the experience of christ\n\n(1:00:55) hood oh we become christ and christ prepares man for the experience of god but the light that reveals to us the presence of the christ the light that reveals to us the path of christ comes from lucifer he is the light giver he is aptly named the morning star because it is his light that heralds for man the dawn of a\n\n(1:01:12) greater consciousness david spangler there he says it straight up david spangler writes we can take all the scriptures and all the teachings and all the tablets and all the laws and all the marshmallows and have a jolly good bonfire and marshmallow roast because that is all they are worth okay i don't think they like the bible very\n\n(1:01:36) much or the law of god these are the movers and shakers of the united nations they're waiting for a new economic order where i'm not going to go into those details we affirm that the economy of all nations is a seamless web they want to join it together and a new international economic order that's world goodwill\n\n(1:01:57) commentary all there by itself we the members of the united nations solemnly proclaim our united determination to work urgently for the establishment of a new economic international order the whole world is going to be controlled at every single level by these people a complete change in the world's financial\n\n(1:02:18) and economic order is imperative benjamin cream spokesman for matreya so un general assembly says new international economic order and so we have all these strange happenings buckmaster fuller says don't give me any other job just let me be head of the world food authority and i'll have the whole world\n\n(1:02:42) at my feet tomorrow they're going to use food to create enough tension to make everyone accept this benjamin cream also wrote the industrialists economists administrators of great experience and achievement who with a hierarchy that's a bunch of demons by the way have worked out plans and blueprints which will\n\n(1:03:04) solve the redistribution problems of the world when the political will is there to implement them so that means when they start stealing from those who have and give it to all the others matreya himself this new age christ the un is the major hope of the world in its interrelationships we can see democracy\n\n(1:03:28) writ large the symbol for the expression of god's will that men call goodwill with the advent of the christ this good will will bring all men and all nations into correct relationships and create the necessary circumstances for the expression of that synthesis which will be the outstanding keynote of\n\n(1:03:45) the coming civilization in this vast enterprise the u.n will play a major role remember revelation 17 the ten horns you saw ten kings who have not yet received the kingdom but for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast they have one purpose to give their power and authority to the beast and\n\n(1:04:05) they will make war against the lamb ten regions according to gary h carr the club of rome divided the world into and wrote the new constitution and we have this new civilization and it was held at the female hotel masonic auditorium in san francisco conference document says we are experienced the birth of a\n\n(1:04:30) first global civilization eric historic timely global initiative 1995. and there it was and they were ready for it cia nato mi5 cri all of these have occult symbols in them which we don't have to go into details the trilateral commission the 666 the 666 is in the federal reserve sss that was the original sixth letter\n\n(1:05:00) of the greek alphabet f is the sixth letter of our alphabet this all spells 666. now what about these world religions now this is the crux of the matter and if we can concentrate on this issue tonight this will be the hub of what is going to happen was it not inevitable that the un would sooner or later also acquire a spiritual\n\n(1:05:24) dimension that's what robert mueller says the big man behind world education world media university of peace all of these things robert mueller writes there's a famous poster which shows christ knocking at the tall united nations building wanting to enter it i often visualize in my mind another even more accurate painting that of the\n\n(1:05:46) united nations which would be the body of christ interesting doesn't christ say my kingdom is not of this world so this is another kingdom and this christ is definitely not jesus christ he then refers to pope john paul said that we are stone cutters and artisans of a cathedral which we might never see in its finished\n\n(1:06:09) beauty ah this is my sonic language that pope john paul ii is talking about the tapestry of its work encompasses the total condition of humankind on this planet all this is part of one of the most prodigious pages of evolution it will require the detachment and objectivity of future historians to appraise fully what\n\n(1:06:33) happened in the last third of our century and to understand the real significance of what the united nations was no human force will ever be able to destroy the united nations interesting for the united nations is not a mere building or a mere idea it is not a man-made creation this is robert miller speaking under\n\n(1:06:58) sick former under secretary general of the united states it wasn't man made then who made it who made it if it man didn't make it well they told us who the leader is in so many words who is he lucifer okay the united nations is the vision light of the absolute supreme masonic signal language which is slowly steadily\n\n(1:07:20) and unearly illuminating you know the buzzwords by now the ignorance the night of our human life the divine success and supreme progress of the united nations is bound to become a reality at his choice hour the absolute supreme will ring his own victory bell here on earth through the loving and serving heart of\n\n(1:07:40) the united nations wow this is a bomber he's going to ring his victory bell thank you robert mueller what else do you have to say on the issue decide to open yourself to the potential of the human rights to the infinity of your inner self and you will become the universe at long last your real divine self that really\n\n(1:08:06) puts it all in the picture i'm more more drawn to some of the very simple but extremely important teachings of the christ and of all the great prophets and visionaries i'm increasingly convinced that what they foresaw is the beginning to become a reality on the planet and that humanity is transcending or\n\n(1:08:26) metamorphosing itself into what those great dreamers and visionaries and prophets envisioned we're changing we're going to undergo a change the world's major religions in the end all want the same thing do they even though they were born in different places different circumstances what the world needs today is a\n\n(1:08:43) convergence of the different religions in the search and definition of the cosmic and divine laws which ought to regulate the behavior on this planet worldwide spiritual echomenism expressed in new forms of religious cooperation institutions would probably be closest to the hearts of the resurrected christ\n\n(1:09:04) thank you very interesting peace will be impossible robert mueller speaking without the taming of fundamentalism through a united religions that professes faithfulness only to the global spirituality and the health of the planet so fundamentalism has to be tamed let's start with islam where do you think they will end\n\n(1:09:35) certainly with christianity the new world religion must be based on those truths which have stood the test of the ages they are steadily taking shape in human thinking and for them the united nations fights my great personal dream writes robert mueller is to get a tremendous alliance between all the major religions and the united\n\n(1:09:58) nations well this is fascinating stuff there will be not be any dissociation between the universal church and the sacred lodge of all true masons and the inner circle of the esoteric society that said alissa bailey robert miller says that's their philosophy so they have it freemasonry luciferianism this is the kingdom on earth\n\n(1:10:23) june 1995 an interfaith summit conference was held in san francisco for the purpose of uniting the world's religions into a global organizations the united religions organizations called or you are it will be an international inter-religious organization modeled after and affiliated with the united nations\n\n(1:10:46) according to its literature so it's howard dispatch ministry the uro launched its written charter in june 1997. the institution should be fully in place by june 2000 globally operational by june 2005. how far is that off oh that's just around the corner i get excited cooperating closely with the un and its organizations to\n\n(1:11:14) complement the un's political diplomatic etc the interfaith conference anglican bishop william e swing issued the challenge for a new global civilization he said we stand on the threshold of a new world order that may be defined either by an increasing polarization that fuels a spiral of escalating conflict and\n\n(1:11:36) violence or by growing global cooperation that calls the human race to work across national ethnic and religious boundaries to serve a larger global good see where we're heading robert mueller and this is very exciting dispatch magazine do not worry if not all religions will join the united religions organization\n\n(1:12:02) many nations did not join the un at the beginning but later regretted it and made every effort to join it was the same with the european community it will be the case with the world's religions because whoever stays out or aloof will sooner or later regret it wow now that's fascinating where are we going\n\n(1:12:29) sooner or later regret it this man over here is joseph reed he's the under secretary general of the united nations currently and here he's speaking at a huge convention of seventh-day adventists and he's going to tell them exactly who is going to be in control let's listen to him i make this appeal because the united nations is also your\n\n(1:13:04) organization our world organization your united nations delegates please remember the united nations is the only machinery we have for collective cooperation among all nations it is the only worldwide institution for furthering development the united nations is the only universal mechanism for protecting human rights\n\n(1:13:43) the united nations is the only shared framework for strengthening international law delegates the united nations is not one of the luxuries of international life the work of the united nations is of vital importance for the betterment of life on our planet that's very fascinating the united nations is also your\n\n(1:14:16) organization it is the only body for this that that and the other now that's not the speech he wrote he read it for kofi annan the secretary general of the united nations now i have a problem i don't want to be part of a luciferian organization i certainly don't want to be that's just me personally the mystical tradition in the\n\n(1:14:44) mainline denominations easily interact with those of the heathen religions of the world meditation practices visualization techniques breathing exercises are now being used to tap into spiritual realm and this such religious leaders as pope the pope and the dalai lama are very much on the same plane the sermon\n\n(1:15:02) newsletter 1996 a religion to fit everyone goals of this one world religion world goodwill remember this is all un-affiliated organizations founded by the very highest level of people the churches and and the world religions should indicate the unity within all facets of truth which will provide a universal platform\n\n(1:15:28) one to which all men everywhere could give allegiance such a platform should include the truth that all men are divine thank you can we do that yes or no i hope not the truth that evolution governs the growth of the human being i don't believe in that either each individual is a god all men are divine\n\n(1:15:52) and the belief in evolution the fact of immortality and of eternal persistence reincarnation arising from man's essential divinity the bible clearly teaches us that there is no such thing as reincarnation for disappointed unto men once to die these are all taken from direct quotes preparation for by men and women of good will is\n\n(1:16:22) needed to introduce new values new standards and new attitudes prepare for a coming world teacher requirements of a new world order and a reorganization of social structure i want nothing to do with that i want nothing to do with that alisa bailly writes the same old formulas the same old theologies\n\n(1:16:45) the same old interpretations are deemed adequate to meet men's modern needs and inquiries they are not the church today is the tomb of the christ and the stone of theology has been rolled to the door of the sepulcher oh jesus and his theology goodbye goodbye she writes the days dawning when all the religions\n\n(1:17:10) will be regarded as emanating from one great spiritual source all will be seen as unitedly providing one route out of which the universal world religion will inevitably emerge then there will be neither christian nor heathen neither jew nor gentile but simply one great body of believers gathered out of all the current\n\n(1:17:33) religions that sounds nice but whose religion will it be they will accept the same truths not as theological concepts but as essential to spiritual living they will stand together on the same platform of brotherhood and of human relations they will recognize divine sonship will seek unitedly to cooperate with the divine plans\n\n(1:17:55) such a world religion is no idle dream but something which is definitely forming today well goodwill letter 1993 quoting it these are united nations organizations so obviously the world is going to move towards this unified platform and there will be some who propagate a spirit of separateness is that correct can we see\n\n(1:18:22) that emerging and then there will be conflict and robert mueller says that those who do not want to go along with this will sooner or later come to regret it so obviously we're heading for a clash mello also said we must hope also that the pope will come before the 2000 to the united nations speak for\n\n(1:18:44) all the religions and spiritualities on this planet and give the world the religious view of how the third millennium should be a spiritual millennium a millennium which will see the integration and harmony of humanity who must be the spokesman for this new world religion the pope the plan is coming together revelation\n\n(1:19:08) is unfolding this is exactly what the bible speaks about what will happen instead of becoming dejected and miserable then lift up your heads and start smiling because we're going home this is exciting the world's major religions must speed up dramatically their economical movement and recognize the unity of\n\n(1:19:28) their objectives and diversity of of their cults religions must actively cooperate to bring to unprecedented heights a better understanding of the mysteries of life and of our place in the universe my religion right or wrong and my nation right or wrong must be abandoned forever in the planetary age you're not allowed\n\n(1:19:47) to say jesus is the only way it must be abandoned forever i'm sorry i will not abandon it i refuse and then we had this wonderful meeting the pope actually did appear before the united nations and then they came together in this massive rehearsal at the united nations where they formed this new economical initiative funded by ted\n\n(1:20:12) turner and the whole world is gathering into one new religious pot under the united nations and i saw one of the heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast revelation 13 3 joshua 24 15 and if it seems evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom you will serve\n\n(1:20:43) whether the gods which your forefathers serves that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord that's the decisions we have to make those are the issues before us and the sad thing is i'm not making this up i'm just reading it off the screen\n\n(1:21:08) i'm really not making this up i wish i was but i'm not so we are actually facing a crisis situation but in the lectures that are now coming we will have to look at the other side of the coin we've had enough of this side of the coin don't you think i'm sick to death of it already now let's have a look whether god has an\n\n(1:21:34) answer to what satan is planning now handed out oh i had under that another little card over here and i've got a question on there i'm beginning to see that the battle is not really political did you see that tonight the battle is not really political but the religiou political they want your allegiance and your mind\n\n(1:22:04) i see that the devil has it so set up that the whole world and even if possible the very elect are to be deceived and mesmerized by his devices by god's grace the second point i do not want to be one of those that are deceived i see that it is more than just being aware of the problem i see that i will have to make a\n\n(1:22:29) concerted effort to find truth and to become and remain undeceived what is the only channel whereby we can find out the will of god you tell me the bible if god hadn't given us the bible we would be hopelessly at sea thank god god gave us the bible what would we do without it i wouldn't know where we're going\n\n(1:22:58) it would all seem logical it would all seem okay everybody would be happy to climb onto this bandwagon right or wrong i want to know how jesus will be victor in this controversy all we've seen is satan build up his kingdom and that's exactly what the book of revelation is about i'm interested in learning more and to\n\n(1:23:20) plan to attend the next lectures because this is where the counter plan of god will start to be discussed we're not going to go back to the bible and we're going to find out what god has in store for us but if i could just be so daring as to ask just show me your hands if you want to who sees that jesus is being eradicated from the\n\n(1:23:46) world plan who sees it wow so there's a total onslaught on jesus christ and we are just caught in the battle isn't that right we're just caught in the battle so what hope have we got of changing the status quo none none if you think you can change this forget it we have no hope who is our only hope jesus christ he is our only hope\n\n(1:24:21) without him we are nothing that's why i can stand here today because i know there's nothing i can do but he can do something he's even made it possible for me to stand here and speak to you isn't that great all things are possible do you know that i've given these lectures in the masonic hall [Music]\n\n(1:24:42) yes all things are possible absolutely amazing [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] you",
  "# Title:227_the_battle_of_the_giants_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nEnd-Time Delusions,Battle of Giants,God's Commandments,Pagan Sun Worship,Catholic Church Deceptions\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"The Battle of the Giants,\" delves into Revelation chapter 12 to explain the cosmic struggle between good and evil. It identifies God's people as a pure \"woman\" clothed with the sun and moon, representing the church and its reflection of Christ's light, while the \"great red dragon\" symbolizes Satan, the adversary. The core conflict stems from humanity's gift of free will and the subsequent distortion of God's law by forces like the Roman Catholic Church, which the speaker argues has replaced divine commandments with human traditions and a focus on Mary instead of Jesus. Ultimately, the source emphasizes that this battle will culminate in a final clash, with those who keep God's commandments and hold to the testimony of Jesus Christ emerging as the victorious remnant.\n\n## Content:\n(2) Total Onslaught 227 The Battle of the Giants Total Onslaught Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KPCwUZyPTQ\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] tonight's lecture is titled the Battle of the Giants and we are going back into the Bible tonight this is a expose of Revelation chapter 12 the book of Revelation by John revelation is God's protection from last day delusions as we have seen Revelation tells us exactly who the main role players are going to\n\n(01:31) be at the end of time who's going to be involved in bringing about these great delusions and deceptions and how we can avoid them it describes an enormous struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil and it's just a brief summary the details of the war are given in the chapters prior to chapter 12 and\n\n(01:56) in the chapters post chapter 12 so tonight we're just going to look at the struggle and we're going to pick up on one or two important little components and then we're going to go in the next lectures to the hub of the matter and see who's who and who is described well the battle started not only in Eden\n\n(02:21) before that even but Genesis 1:27 so God created man in his own image and the image of God he created him male and female he created them this is a fantastic new creation where God creates being there are male and female and God said let us make man in our image there's a plural over there after our\n\n(02:49) likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air the cattle the over all the earth and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth this is a brand new scenario brand-new because here God is creating an order of being that is to have dominion none of the Angels had dominion none of\n\n(03:16) the Angels had been created male and female this was a new order the Bible tells us clearly that angels are not like we are and why would God do this you see God was creating a new order of being who would understand the mindset of God even in the capacity of his creative ability because by bringing\n\n(03:45) forth life and nurturing that life we can learn to understand what it means to have the watch care of a loving God if we bring forth children into this world we know that we have to plant the hedge of protection around them love requires it doesn't that make sense love requires it and so God had put a hedge of\n\n(04:12) protection around his creation which is known as the commandments of God but God was misunderstood at the level of his creation because they believed that they were now subject to rules even though they were themselves exalted beings and so this battle arose God's answer in part to this problem is a new order of\n\n(04:38) being God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply he hadn't said that to any other angel replenish the earth subdue it have dominion he hadn't said that to an angel either God is the only one who had dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and of every living thing that\n\n(04:57) moves upon the earth Genesis 1:26 2:28 and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food and the Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so God gave them a choice God City is a choice you can choose to know the good and to\n\n(05:20) practice the good or you can choose the knowledge of evil and have sadness pain and a choice is yours free agents you can choose the greatest gift that God has ever given to anything in the universe is the gift of choice because without the gift of choice we would be robots and any love that we receive from anyone else would be by\n\n(05:53) force or compulsion or programming but wouldn't be by choice making it meaningless but the very nature of choice requires that we can actually choose that means we can choose against God and that is a risk that God took but he didn't take it like that he was prepared to die for it now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the\n\n(06:18) field which Jehovah God had made and he said unto the woman yay has God said you shall not eat of any tree of the garden so he questions the Word of God but he still does that today is very good at that it's called higher criticism we made of the true fruit from the trees of the garden but God did say you must not\n\n(06:38) eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die Genesis three two and three so in other words death would be the consequence because simply puts if you take it right down to its final analysis if you choose not to follow the requirements of God you will have suffering mayhem death\n\n(07:04) murder illness disease all those things brought upon you because you separate yourself willfully from God well that is your choice then well Adam and Eve chose and they chose not to follow the requirements of God Genesis 3:24 says so he drove the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the cherubim and the\n\n(07:36) flame of the sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life so man was cut off from the tree of life did he instantly die no he had so much vitality at that stage that it took him a while to actually die so the death that we're talking about is not just the physical death we're talking about total\n\n(08:04) death the wages of sin is death Romans 6:23 not a transition from one phase to another it's death it's what the Bible says and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and then he died Genesis 5 verse 5 he was dead well did God leave man to this death no he had a promise for him a solution\n\n(08:34) genesis 3:15 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed he shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now was even trouble from that day onwards well II died sometime after that and who is then in trouble now surely that is not a reference to Eve so who is\n\n(09:09) the woman well we'll come to that in some more detail a woman in the Bible used in this prophetic sense is a symbol of God's people and we'll discuss this in a moment so when the Bible speaks of a woman a bride then it is a symbol of those that are betrothed to God that's his people so in other words I will put\n\n(09:34) enmity between God's people and between thy seed that is Lucifer's people Satan's people and her seed singular out of her would come the seed that would save mankind and that seed says Paul his singular reference to Jesus and anybody who is in Jesus can have eternal life through him he masculine the seed this\n\n(10:13) Savior shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so they will be a war between them now the Roman Catholic Church not liking it the way it is using the symbol of the woman as the church changes it to mean Mary who was not alive at that time and wasn't going to be alive for a long long time\n\n(10:41) meaning that well the serpent would have had free reign for quite a few thousand years yes which makes no sense whatsoever so that UA rhymes online Bible says I will put enmity between thee and the woman and thy seed and her seed and she shall crush thy head and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel that's turned the\n\n(11:04) whole gospel upside down and that has made somebody else of the Savior so right from the beginning it seems there was this conflict so in Revelation 12 we pick up the story and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun interesting a great wonder a woman clothed with the Sun and the\n\n(11:32) moon under her feet we have two symbols there the moon and the Sun and upon her head a crown of twelve stars so the number 12 is significant and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered now Catholicism makes that literal and says Mary is going to have a child but if you take it\n\n(11:57) prophetically that means out of God's people the Messiah will come that's what it means and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold the great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his heads and we've spoken about all of those issues before the dragon as we will find\n\n(12:18) out is Satan or Lucifer the fallen angel the seven heads a reference to what we saw in the Book of Daniel where all the kingdoms of the world have seven heads if you tie them up so over the course of history or what the battle would be and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his head so Lucifer is the ultimate ruler\n\n(12:44) behind the scenes the ten horns is a reference to the kingdoms well here is this Roman Catholic web page that we've read before just to bring it to put into perspective here it is no surprise that the woman would triumph over the red dragon for scripture says so at the very beginning refer genesis 3:15 which\n\n(13:07) states and i will establish a feud between thee and the woman between thy offspring and hers she is to crush thy head while thou dost lie in ambush at her heels so which version are they quoting they're quoting the Roman Catholic version right they're quoting the Jesuit Bible version not even their own good news quotes it like that even\n\n(13:34) the good news Bible has a drive only the Jesuit one quotes are wrong strange that they should use it or not strange understandable that they should use this to substantiate their theology they continue to say to Mary the woman of Scripture and mother of the men notices who keep the commandments and hold fast\n\n(13:55) to the truths concerning Jesus well there is a distortion of the text as well because it doesn't read like that but it is a quote a distorted quote from Revelation chapter 12 verse 17 very interest so they apply revelation 12 verse 17 to those who honor Mary and keep her Commandments is that basically what\n\n(14:23) she's saying good the church applies the beautiful words of wisdom she the glow that radiates from eternal love she the untarnished mirror of God's majesty she the faithful image of His goodness now who is really the Express image of his brightness Jesus see here we have a conflict we have a conflict between two\n\n(14:48) ideologies because Mary is full of grace Luke 1:28 the church through Pope Pius the 9th in his ineffable Estelle's and Apostolic Constitution issued on December 8 1854 confirmed the tradition not the word tradition they know it's not biblical that held Mary as being conceived immaculate so the Roman\n\n(15:13) Catholic Church applies revelation 12 to Mary of course the reference is also that we keep her Commandments because that is the battle well the Pope can modify divine law prompter biblioteca Papa article 2 and if we look at the ten commandments as they are given in the Bible and we compare it with the Ten\n\n(15:46) Commandments as given by the Roman Catholic Church even their Bible their official Bible has it right only their catechism book has it wrong [Music] the original Commandments given by God's there shalt have no other gods before me well and the Lord your God you shall have no other gods before me that's the\n\n(16:07) same the second commandment thou shalt not make for yourself any graven image or any likeness so anything in heaven above on the earth beneath shall not bow down to them etc etc etc that commandment is gone here gone in the Roman Catholic catechism so the third commandment thou shalt not take the name the LORD thy God in vain\n\n(16:32) now here becomes the second commandment you see that remember the Sabbath day keep only the Sabbath day is now the third commandment which was the fourth and then the rest of the same honor thy father my mother do not steal it cetera do not kill cetera all the way down thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt\n\n(16:53) not bear false witness but they've taken out one so now they have to divide the tenth into two which is that thou shalt not covet commandment which Paul clearly lists as one commandment thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife noise manservant noise maid servant noise\n\n(17:16) ARC's noise asks nor anything that is thy neighbors now please note how they have to turn it around because it really doesn't make any sense to say as a whole commandment thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house that doesn't make any sense right so they've split it rather the other way around and made the ninth\n\n(17:38) commandment thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife well at least they acknowledge that the wife is more important than the house and then thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's good so they've split that round a little bit now Protestantism in the out sport confession is just a little bit more honest than that and leaves it in the\n\n(18:05) right order although the commandments don't make much sense then so that's an interesting analogy so one commandment is gone and one commandment the day has been shifted the Sabbath now here is not the seventh day but the first day and the tenth commandment is split into two so that we have Ten Commandments again\n\n(18:26) so this is the law of Catholicism and those that follow Mary must keep these Commandments as we will see in another lecture which is quite an in interesting little tug of war between two rulers the God of heaven and the Prince of this world well we continue the catholic encyclopedia admits it quite freely the\n\n(18:52) Church of the changing the day of rest from the Jewish Sabbath or the seventh day of the week to the first made the third commandment which although it should be the fourth commandment so yeah they admit that they must have removed one otherwise it wouldn't be the third one right admit it refer to Sunday as\n\n(19:10) the day to be kept holy as the Lord's Day but Jesus says in Matthew chapter 5:17 think not that I am come to destroy the law and the prophets I'm not come to destroy but to fulfil to live them out to show you and then he continues to say not one jot or one tittle will by any means disappear from the law until all has been accomplished\n\n(19:35) to heaven and earth pass away not one jot not one tittle will pass from the law so according to the Bible the law stands forever Roman Catholicism says no we're above the Bible we changed the law revelation to our fall and his tail this is now the Serpent's tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and if you\n\n(19:59) look at Hebrew parallelism in the Bible you'll find that the stars represent in this prophetic sense angels so we can say that Satan drew one-third of the angels with him and it costs them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it\n\n(20:21) was born out of God's people would come the Messiah and Satan was watching The Times of fulfillments which are given in the Book of Daniel precisely and he was looking and waiting for the deliverance of this child and when this child was to be born he wanted to destroy him instantly and she brought forth a man\n\n(20:44) child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and a child was caught up and to God and to his throne in one verse you have the birth of the Messiah and you have his resurrection and you have his ascension into heaven all in one verse but you can see it's a very masculine verse although Catholicism would like to\n\n(21:09) emulate it and therefore they have Mary's ascension into heaven so she also dies but is woken up and has an ascension into heaven so everything is a counterfeit and the woman fled into the wilderness where she has a place prepared of God that she should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days now if this is Mary we\n\n(21:36) have a problem right this is Mary we have a problem because how does Mary fulfill the prophecy of fleeing into a wilderness for 1260 days prophetically speaking if we continue and there was a war in heaven so it's a backtrack God is explaining what happened why there is this battle on this earth and it says\n\n(22:04) there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels so there was a war in heaven already revelation verse eight 12 verse eight says and prevailed not so the dragon did not prevail neither was their place found any more in heaven so a third of the\n\n(22:30) angels rebelled against the government of God they must have been a battle for the minds of the angels and I can imagine that Satan worked with all cunning deception that you can imagine insinuating hate insinuating unfairness and insinuating that he was deeply wronged as the main angel in heaven not\n\n(22:58) to receive more honor and glory sad sad story he does the same des everybody has a hunger for glory and that can only be satisfied if others are obsequious and bow down to you that is when you get your glory satisfied on this earth and that's probably what he tried in heaven and Jesus being the humble one that he is never used his\n\n(23:27) methodology he never forced himself upon anyone but just let his character speak for itself and so it came to a rebellion but he prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven now Michael and his angels now who's Michael the Jarvis witnesses will tell us Michael is a Archangel an archangel but\n\n(23:51) what does Michael mean meet hi al look it up in any children's book four names was Mihai L mean it means he that is what God is he that is what God is when God came to this earth as man he was to be called Emmanuel God with us call his name Yeshua yave the savior you see the name has a meaning you know we\n\n(24:31) today have a name and that's it but in biblical times the name had a meaning a very special meaning and so you find that names change as circumstances change in the Bible can you think of any such interesting cases when names change when circumstances change didn't Jacob become Israel Israel now Jacob means the supplanter the one\n\n(25:04) who takes the place off and he was the second to come out but he took the place of the first by tricking him of which he repented later most certainly repented but when he had found Christ when he had wrestled with God for forgiveness repented of his sin then he was called Israel he who had wrestled with God and\n\n(25:34) overcome see name changed because circumstances had changed now mikail he who is what God is let's have a look who is me file metal is called in Daniel chapter 10 verse 21 your ruler so he's the ruler of God's people well who's the ruler of God's people Jesus but Jesus was in heaven before he came down to earth is that\n\n(26:04) correct yes or no yeah he was in heaven before he came down to earth and he was not Joshua Yahweh the Saviour that had come to die for us now he was mikail he who is what God is it's continued and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which stands for the children of thy people Daniel 12 verse 1\n\n(26:28) who's the Great Prince that stands for us there's only one the Bible makes it quite clear Jesus is the one who stands for us but Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he argued about the body of Moses Jude 9 who has the right to argue over the body of someone that is to be resurrected who\n\n(26:52) only God only Jesus has the right to do that did he raise Moses from the dead yes or no absolutely how do we know because Moses appeared to him on the Mount of Transfiguration and how do we know that well here he was resurrected and who else appeared with him Elijah and Elijah never saw death so one\n\n(27:17) represents those who will be translated without seeing death Elijah and 1 represents those who will be resurrected through the power of the same Christ and have eternal life well let's see if the Bible applies this word Archangel for the Lord Himself now we know that it's Jesus Christ shall descend from heaven\n\n(27:41) with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first John 5:28 says that it is the voice of the Son of Man all right so this voice of the Archangel is the voice of the Son of Man then who is he then then he's God you see the word Archangel can mean an angel highest angel but it\n\n(28:07) also means the highest messenger now what is the greatest message of the godhood the manifestation of the godhood that can touch us and reach us and talk to us and communicate and make us accessible to God so the greatest message that God has is himself in the form of he who is what God is nicaya all\n\n(28:33) right so now we see that the Bible uses this word Archangel for the voice of the son of man let's see we can find this angel in the Old Testament Genesis 48 16 the angel who redeemed me from all evil now we have a problem if we're gonna make an angel a created being right who's the only one who can redeem you\n\n(28:57) Jesus so this redeeming angel over here is Jesus go further and the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire Exodus 3 verse 2 now who's that well it must be the same one by the way if this was a created being why did he come and worship didn't he say you are on holy ground take off your shoes and he\n\n(29:21) worshiped him yes or no yes so here's an angel that receives worship so this can only be God this is not a created angel this is one who is going forth has been from forever in all their afflictions he was afflicted and the angel of his presence now there you have the nice nutshell saved them in his love and in\n\n(29:46) his pity he redeemed them as ayah 63 verse 9 so Michael and his angels is Jesus Christ and the heavenly host and then you have the dragon and his angels so who is the dragon the Great Dragon was cast out that also been called devil Satan who deceives the whole world revelation 12:9 pretty plain and simple\n\n(30:13) there we go where did the devil come from Ezekiel 28 13 there has been in Eden in the Garden of God every precious stone was thy covering in the day that thou was created he's a created being whether he likes it or not he is a created being thou art the anointed cherub that covereth so Satan when he was Lucifer was one of\n\n(30:41) the covering cherubs that stood over the Ark of the Covenant that was perfect in the way in thy ways from the day that that was created till iniquity was found in thee a mystery why should iniquity come into Lucifer when he was perfect from the day that he was created why should it happen obviously he was\n\n(31:04) created with what freedom of choice so he's a order of being in the image of God because he has freedom of choice and he at some stage chose to let jealousy and selfishness rule ease hearts and thou has sinned what is sin transgressing God's law that's what 1 John says in fact that's the only definition given in the Bible\n\n(31:38) for what it is therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God and I will destroy the Oh covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty here we have pride that has corrupted wisdom because of thy brightness that has defiled thy sanctuaries by the\n\n(32:00) multitude of thine iniquities so he started off his own church if you like therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee shall devour thee and I will bring me to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold him and never shalt thou be any more what will happen with Satan at the end he\n\n(32:18) will be destroyed that's not what the Christian world teaches there but this is what the Bible says we'll have to look at that in some detail as well so what is masonry high masonry now and the secret doctrine of masonry do with this concept they have to turn it upside down do you remember these quotes let me give\n\n(32:41) them to you the Appalachian Satan in Hebrews satin and adversary' from the word shaitana to be adverse to persecute belongs by right - the first and cruelest adversary of all the other gods Jehovah Wow not to the serpent which spoke any words of sympathy and wisdom and ease at the worst even in the dogma\n\n(33:05) the adversary of men okay secret doctrines volume 2 page 388 now I have those books so this is genuine it stands there is not hearsay so what has the inner circle of Jesuit teaching done to the doctrine of God being the one who cares and loves us and saves us what has it done to that doctrine turned it\n\n(33:33) upside down you see they say God wanted to prevent us from knowing something yes God wanted to prevent us from knowing something he wanted to prevent us from knowing evil because he never wanted a mother to cry at the grave of her dead son or daughter that's why and he never wanted the heartache that we have on\n\n(33:55) this planet yes would be a good thing if we never knew evil would be a very good thing but unfortunately we're living with it so they turn it upside down now the good guy is the serpent and the bad guy is the other secret doctrine volume 2 page 319 there for jehovah was called by the Gnostics the creator of and one of\n\n(34:19) the few morphs the serpent Satan or evil alright so we've turned it upside down in masonry and in the inner circle of the Roman Catholic Church remember that it was formed and created by the Jesuit Order and we have a whole lecture on that the secret behind secret societies you remember that one secret doctrine\n\n(34:44) page 418 he's at Eric explanation may I ever bring some order in this confusion because the Bible now says the exact opposite let's look at it from the esoteric point of view says Blavatsky in which Jehovah becomes Saturn and Michael and his army isn't that interesting so they also believe that Jehovah is\n\n(35:09) Michael Satan and the rebellious angels are into the indiscreet endeavors of the two faithful zealots to see in every pagan God a devil hmm okay interesting let's make it even clearer secret doctrine volume 2 page 508 that Michael being simply Jehovah himself one of the sub ordinate spirits at bears okay so if\n\n(35:40) we're looking at this story then we see me hail the one who is what God is and his angels fighting against the dragon who has been caused down to the serve the serpent they turn around and say no the bad guy is Jehovah but they are free to admit though this is the strange thing that it is the good guy who's down\n\n(36:07) on earth here now so they're admitting at least that he got licked up there got thrown out well let's see secret doctrine volume 1 page 71 the devil is now called darkness by the church where's and the Bible is called the son of God the bright star of the early morning Lucifer there's a whole philosophy of dogmatic Crofton the\n\n(36:27) reason why the first archangel who sprang from the depth of chaos was called looks Lucifer the luminous son of the morning a man van Tariq dawn he was transformed by the church into Lucifer or Satan because he is brighter and older than Jehovah and had to be sacrificed to the new dogma who by king revelation 12:7 9 and the Great Dragon\n\n(36:51) was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him that's what the Bible says you can choose whether you want to believe the one or the other Bible says he got thrown out even the inner circle of masonry believe\n\n(37:10) that the one ruling down here now got thrown up but they say he will be reinstated that's not what the Bible says revelation 12:10 and 11 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren\n\n(37:32) is cast down which accused them before our God day and night so the Bible says devil is down you not the good guy and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives and today so here Jesus came to this earth he died for us he did demonstrate it to us that\n\n(37:59) God is love there is no greater evidence than this God is love and you can believe their lie or you can believe this revelation 12:12 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them that's the angelic hosts because they must have had a long time of misery to this war has been going on for a long\n\n(38:24) time while to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea that's the people's the nation's for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knows that he has but a short time so God is gonna limit his time God is gonna cut his little experiment with sin shorts so when we look at these beginning verses in\n\n(38:50) Revelation 12 they appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun that is the Church of God with the power of Jesus Christ behind her and the moon under her feet that is the law and the equipment to fight it the lesser light we reflecting the greater light and upon her head a crown of 12 stars\n\n(39:15) there were twelve tribes of Israel there were twelve apostels in the early church she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered now let's go and look at this woman in a little bit more detail Malachi chapter 4 verse 2 but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise\n\n(39:38) with healing in his wings so Jesus is called the son it's you in of righteousness now Lucifer takes the symbol of the Sun which is applied to Jesus Christ and applies it to himself he takes all the credit it turns the whole gospel upside down he seed shall endure forever and his throne as the son before me Psalms 89 36 so the Sun is\n\n(40:07) used as a symbol of Jesus and Satan takes the symbol and applies it to his worship in the end psalm 39 verse 37 it shall be established forever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven a witness of what it what does the moon do you know in order for us to see it it reflects the light of the Sun so the\n\n(40:36) faithful witness the moon under her feet is reflecting the glory of Jesus Christ to the world that's his people only his people can do that because Jesus doesn't have to reflect his glory he his own glory so this is God's people 1 Peter 2:9 but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people this is what we\n\n(41:02) are supposed to be Jeremiah 6 verse 2 who makes it a little bit more clear I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman so here's the comparison God's people he's a likened compared to a beautiful woman Zion were they it's just made quite sure isaiah 51:16 say unto Zion thou art my\n\n(41:29) people so we have the parallelism God's people have been compared to a comely and delicate woman as ayah 54 5 for thy Mecca is thine husband the Lord of Hosts is his name and I Redeemer the Holy One of Israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called for the Lord has called thee as a woman Forsaken and\n\n(41:52) grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused says thy God so is this Mary or is this God's people it's definitely God's people Isaiah 2:19 and I will betroth thee unto me for ever yea will betroth he unto me in righteousness and in judgments and in loving-kindness and in mercies I will\n\n(42:16) even betrothed the unto me in faithfulness and hour shalt know the Lord for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy not human jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ 2 Corinthians 11:2 the symbology there is the symbolism is amazing the woman is the church and she being with\n\n(42:42) child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered revelation 12 verse 2 and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and a child was caught up unto God and to his throne so out of God's people who would come the Messiah John 4:22 you worship you know not what Jesus says to the woman at\n\n(43:09) the well we know as speaking as a Jew what we worship for salvation is of the Jews God's people so out of God's people would come the Messiah Psalms 279 I will declare the decree the Lord has said unto me thou art my son in this day I've forgotten the ask me and I shall give you the heathen for thine inheritance\n\n(43:33) and the uttermost parts of the earth for that position thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a Potter's vessel God will be the victor in this tremendous battle revelation 19:15 says and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nation's and he shall rule them with\n\n(43:54) a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God God's wrath is not our wrath it is poured out without anger it is poured out with tears revelation 12:3 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and\n\n(44:17) seven Crown's upon his hips and his tail drew a third part of the stars out of heaven Satan is down here now stands before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour the child as soon as it was born and when Jesus was born he was ready and he waited to have this child destroyed and he sent out the\n\n(44:39) Roman legions to go and kill every little boy that was in Bethlehem and surrounds and the little skulls were everywhere and today even in some monasteries you can find these skulls and they say these are the children that Herod killed and they mercilessly slaughtered but God took his son and they fled to Egypt but eventually he did\n\n(45:07) kill him and crucify him for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 6:23 and then he ascended into heaven where he sits on the right hand of the Father and he will come to reclaim his kingdom and I pray that we may all be on his side now the\n\n(45:33) adversary side let's have a look at this Hebrews 2:14 since the children have flesh and blood he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death that is the devil so the devil thought he had him beat he thought he had him licked and the greatest apparent defeat\n\n(45:58) turned into the greatest victory of all time so the Old Testament church was guided and protected by God so that it could proclaim and bring forth the Messiah revelation 12:13 and the dragon persecuted the woman which brought forth the manchild Isis Mary or what did the dragon do after the Lord had been taken up to heaven what\n\n(46:28) did he do he persecuted God's people so the dragon Satan now goes for those who profess Jesus Christ revelation 12:6 and the woman fled into the wilderness that's a place of paucity of people not many nations a wilderness dry place hidden to the solitary places where she has a place prepared of God that they\n\n(47:01) should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days revelation 12:6 now we've heard that one before now let's look at some Hebrew parallelism yeah 1260 days if we go to revelation 12:14 we have the same symbolism and to the woman as the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might\n\n(47:25) fly into the wilderness into her place where she nourished for a time times and half a time from the face of the serpent so we have two times mentioned here 1260 days time times and half a time but we have the same symbolism we have the woman we have the wilderness and we have a time what does that tell us that it's the\n\n(47:49) same time period prophetically it's the same time period I have a point at the--at each day for a year is a go for six so that would mean 1200 prophetic days making it 1260 literal years and we have these time periods and Daniel 7:25 time times and the dividing of times Daniel 12 seven time times and half a\n\n(48:15) time three and a half prophetic years three and a half times 360 1260 forty two months forty two prophetic months thirty days per month that was the Hebrew month thirty times forty two 1260 twelve hundred and sixty 1260 time times and half a time forty and two months one two three four five six seven seven\n\n(48:37) times seven is the number of completeness this power takes the place of God gets at seven times now we've dealt with us before the 1260 day period when we dealt with Revelation chapter 11 so I'm not going to deal with us in detail suffice to say that the papal system officially commenced its rule in\n\n(49:02) 538 and was officially ended in 1798 in an apparent wound when birtija took the Pope captive and Napoleon declared that the rule of the papacy was at named of course the Bible says the wound will heal and she will once again qualify as a beast and the whole world will follow her but during this 1260 day period from\n\n(49:31) 538 to 1798 the papacy relentlessly persecuted God's people who scattered and hid themselves in the wilderness numbers 151 253 the tabernacle was pitched in the midst of the people and John 1:14 Jesus in the midst of his people the tabernacle the way to salvation Jesus the door Jesus the sacrifice Jesus the one who washes you\n\n(50:00) Jesus the light of the world the intercessor the bread of life the one who shields us from the consequences of the law that's the story of the tabernacle and covers us with his righteousness that all stands for Jesus Christ the church in the wilderness and the Tabernacle in the wilderness beautiful parallels between the old and\n\n(50:24) the new testament so Satan's object was to attack God's church he was furious he had not overcome Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had been raised from the dead he knew his battle was lost and now he was raging who was going to be his sword revelation 17:3 I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured Beast full of names of\n\n(50:50) blasphemy we've dealt with that in detail upon her forehead was a name written Mystery Babylon the Great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth revelation 17:5 we dealt with that in detail the Mystery Babylon the Great the city of Babylon had its origin when God confused the languages at the\n\n(51:10) Tower of Babel the term Babylon in Revelation represents religious confusion and Bob our Babel another portal to God another way of being saved so what does the system represent number one it represents the authority of man number two the word of man they changed the Word of God they're the ones that\n\n(51:36) going to give the norms the works of man how to be saved by your deeds the law of man how they changed it eventually into human rights and the traditions of man well God says we must choose 1 Kings 18:21 and Elijah came to all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bail then follow\n\n(52:03) him is there a choice here yes we still have freedom of choice thank God so this tendency to meet paganism halfway was very early developed upright men strove to stem the tide but the apostasy went on till the church with the exception of a small remnant was submerged under pagan superstition the two babylons by hislop page 93 and so\n\n(52:28) paganism came into the church masquerading as Christianity we haven't had a look at the symbolism the half moon or the sickle moon and the star symbolizing the birth of the Messiah that would empower you to become gods and live forever and that it had the same system in Mesopotamia as they had in Egypt where they had the Trinity Isis\n\n(52:56) Horus set the Gnostics turned the whole gospel upside down made us God and Jesus Christ the devil the Sun became the source of physical life the serpent the source of spiritual life and Asclepius became the life-giving serpents and the serpent God and in all spheres he was the great healer so in medicine pharmacy\n\n(53:25) a pharmacy pharmacy amines witchcraft it's the same word word for witchcraft is farmacia the same over here he will be the healer so we have a mystery of iniquity 2 Thessalonians 2 72 7 and a Mystery Babylon the great revelation 17:5 so another system of salvation 2 Timothy 4 for they will turn away from\n\n(53:54) listening to the truth and give their attention to legends how do you make war against the woman physically and spiritually and the times of his ignorance God winked at I like those texts acts 17 verse 30 because the question is always asked what about the poor people who do not know what about the poor people in\n\n(54:19) Catholicism today who worship God according to the base dictates of their conscience what about them are they were going to be lost know in the times of this ignorance God winked at their ignorant he closed an eye he judges them according to the light that they have and according to their ability to do\n\n(54:45) what is right given the circumstances of their knowledge that's a fair God I like that therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin James 4:17 oops there's the flipside in other words if you know what right and wrong is and you do it not what then then it is for your sin\n\n(55:09) then you become responsible well this man Constantine he wrote the first laws contrary to the law of God and anybody who wasn't willing in the early times of Christianity to obey was persecuted but they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the sword of their testimony which was the Word of God and they loved\n\n(55:32) not their lives unto the death the revelation 12:11 so these persecuted ones suffered under this tremendous attack of the Dragon so early Christianity was based totally and completely on God's Word and they believed that they were justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus Romans 3:24 so the\n\n(55:58) divine system is totally the opposite it's the authority of God it's the Word of God the love of God the law of God the teachings of God now what is Robert unas say about that he says now we've got it all wrong we must get away from this idea that religion is God based it should be man bears aren't we back in the system of\n\n(56:24) Babylon yes or no he's teaching a Babylonian religion so he's part of Babylon and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color dict with gold precious stones pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication we did a whole lecture on that I'm not gonna repeat that but this is what the\n\n(56:43) system is all about revelation 17 want to come hither I will show unto thee the judgment of this great apostate system that sits upon many waters with whom the kings of the earth unfortunately we saw that when we did the United Nations lecture and the New World Order have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the\n\n(57:04) earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication and the whole world believes all these strange doctrines which are not even biblical Christianity became popular and well it became a written majority religion they are as much heathen as they were before era and corruption now came in upon the church\n\n(57:25) like a flood where is history Church history page 54 this is just a fact Revelation predicted that thousands would be deceived as the false teachings of ancient Babylon entered the church and why Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and rulers of\n\n(57:48) darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places we worship God and if we've dared to worship God we have the ire of the serpent upon us and well many people capitulate and rather follow him but if you stay with Christ then this is your battle you will wrestle against these and they will\n\n(58:12) never come a time until you go to your grave that you will not face this of an adversary so the king of babylons word issued from his throne under the authority of the Sun God and that was law whatever he said was a law but the Bible says and he's the head of the body the church Jesus is the head who is the beginning the\n\n(58:36) firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so two systems today we have a papacy that says all power under my feet and we have Christianity true Christianity which says all power under Jesus's feet and the two never shall meet except in opposition they will come a clash history repeats\n\n(59:00) itself thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them Exodus 24 5 so they had literal ones today we have perhaps more spiritual graven images but they're there notice what Ezekiel said of his time Ezekiel 8 16 at the door of the temple of the Lord between the porch and\n\n(59:22) the altar were about 5 and 20 men with their backs towards the temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east and they worshipped the Sun towards these you have Sun worship so their backs were towards the temple and God had designed the temples in such a way that they faced in the opposite direction of pagan worship systems\n\n(59:48) that's interesting we'll see why in a moment and yet they turned their backs on the temple and faced east interesting so their backs were there and the Sun was a foremost God with heathen Dome there's an interesting quote The Sun has worshipers as this hour in Persia and other lands there is in truth something\n\n(1:00:11) royal kingly about the Sun making it a foot emblem of Jesus the Son of Justice hence the church in these countries would seem to have said keep that old pagan name it shall remain consecrated sanctified and thus the pagan Sunday dedicated to Balder became the Christian Sunday sacred to Jesus the Catholic\n\n(1:00:34) world March 1894 page 8 or 9 Sunday being the day in which the Gentiles solemnly adored that planet the Sun the Christians thought to treat to keep the same day and the same name of it that they might not appear peevish and by that means hinder the conversion of the Gentiles so this is what Roman Catholicism did they just\n\n(1:00:54) took it up and the old Sun worship is alive and living today in Egypt the Sun was represented by a huge red dot we'll talk about the red dot at the later stage and you'll be surprised where it pitches up in the world today and of course the birth of the Sun God here we have the goddess not giving birth to the\n\n(1:01:21) Sun temple of hot dog where she consumes the Sun and then she gives birth to him and he is born you have the same in the Egyptian system over there the son being born then she gives birth and the Sun God is born same in the Aztec religion in Mexico the Sun God being born by the woman here you have the throne of Sri\n\n(1:01:46) Lankan kings you have the Sun over there as part of the worship system the throne of Pharaohs had the Sun on it and the Roman throne had the solar disk on it so they were all pagan Sun worship systems if you go into Egyptology you will find the red discs in the horns and you have the Lions support the Sun disk and the\n\n(1:02:11) horizon that was part of Egyptian religion so if we look at our days Monday was the moon's day with the assimilation of the anglo-saxons cannabic scandinavian pagan gods tyranny was one of the oldest gods of the North's mythology and identified with Mars and then we have Tibby stuff Tuesday Wednesday was from Roden or Odin\n\n(1:02:36) tall Thunder God in Germany in German it's Donna's talk the word Donna means thunder of the early Germanic people became synonymous with Thursday then we had acquainted with Roman Jupiter Friday is named of the Frigg the wife of Odin the mother of another Patton got bolder there you have all of those the day of\n\n(1:02:57) Saturn or Saturday and followed by son day the day of rest and Recreation as it is observed today the Sun and myth or not that's a UNESCO publication so they're telling us today our whole system our whole culture is based on pagan Sun worship if you look at cloven he had the Sun right there and the Sun\n\n(1:03:20) symbols that the papacy uses today and the Masonic symbols go beyond anything that can be mentioned there's a whole lecture in another series which is called the wine of Babylon if you want to see all the symbolism in Catholicism that deals with Suns with Sun worship Isis Horus if the emblem of the Jesuit\n\n(1:03:40) Order means Isis Horus set the Egyptian Trinity and you can pick up all of these symbols in the basilica's very fascinating the crosses here the symbols of the birds the symbols of the the yantras of all the pagan Sun worship deities and this one is very interesting over here this is the Sun God Helios in\n\n(1:04:05) the pagan tomb discovered in 1574 beneath sand Peter's Basilica you see the Vatican who is built on a pagan temple site in fact every Cathedral in the world is books on a pagan temple site where possible and there will be certain criteria that have to be made there also both where possible facing east which is of course the opposite of\n\n(1:04:34) what the Bible has to say on this issue if you're going to Vatican square you have the largest solar wheel in the world the wheel within the wheeled emulating the throne of God which is a wheel within a wheel this is an 8 spoke wheel it's called the solar wheel and it is basically saying this is the throne of\n\n(1:04:54) God here's the symbol of shamash and you'll see it's two crosses one with a spike and one with a wavy line the wavy represents the female and the spike represents the male is the symbol of shamash and shamash was of course the deity which is the equivalent of pan pan was the god of the forest diana was\n\n(1:05:18) his consort she was the goddess of the forest so if you want to look at your forestry department go look at its emblem your own one I saw today at your forestry station it's the symbol of shamash very interesting and here's another symbol up there a cylinder seal of Persian with you have the symbol of\n\n(1:05:41) the roster up there and here you will find it in Bombay being used today you'll find it with Zoroastrian priesthood which is alive and a live today this is the system of worship the flame is a symbol of the Sun in Bombay here are the priests working with the flame symbols of Hamas symbols of Sun worship\n\n(1:06:02) you'll find in Buddhism you'll find them in Islam you'll find them in the yin-yang system the knowledge of good and evil male/female the ankh you'll find it all over the place Vishnu azure a star quetzel kotl here you have the myths at home you'll find it on the Roman Catholic cathedrals on the floors everywhere this is pagan Sun\n\n(1:06:23) worship at its best you'll find the Chinook with its one two three four five six seven eight nine burning lamps I was amazed when I was in Israel and I saw the big banners of the menorah with nine candles I saw what's happened to them this is blatant paganism being flashed on their walls all over Israel the trickle on if\n\n(1:06:57) you go to Hinduism The Aleph the number one the first one he has the Sun symbols on it how does seat on element decorated with solar motifs elephants in Hinduism Aleph means the first one the one one is the symbol of Lucifer if you went into the ancient religion Horus was depicted as an as a as a bird of prey if you go\n\n(1:07:24) into the Indian religions of the world that is also how they did pick their deity if you go to the Indian witch doctors for shamans you'll see that solo Sun worship systems on their back this is the system of worship today nothing has changed if you go to the Assante Empire they have Anubis over there they\n\n(1:07:48) have the keys that same as the papacy they have all the solar systems of Sun and Moon and stars and all the traditional dresses that you find for example in the East Bloc countries those are all symbols of Sun worship so here is a charismatic group going to worship in Israel and what are these symbols\n\n(1:08:09) around their necks what is this going to do with Christianity this is pagan Sun worship nothing else yeah you have literal Sun worship today this is in England this is Stone Age and here you have the Druids notice how the Druids are dressed very much like nuns but basically there's no difference except\n\n(1:08:28) that most nuns don't even know that they have judas worship and it's very very sad european sun worship rituals jumping through the fire something which god forbade Drude ceremonies at stonehenge for example now stonehenge is a very interesting place you see it stonehenge you have the circle of stones now\n\n(1:08:50) originally there was a passage leading up to the circle this passage consisted of giant stones well later on what they did is they covered up the giant stones and put a roof on it and that's the basic structure of a cathedral and behind ancient cathedrals you'll have the circular garden and if you go into the center of the garden you\n\n(1:09:14) will find a stone in the middle which is the dot within the center which is the pagan system of you know fertility and all those good things and if you look in those circle gardens you will find pans you'll find Diana's you'll find the consorts all nicely hidden in the gardens I've been in a number of them in\n\n(1:09:34) England and in Europe and it's always quite fun to take aerial photographs to see where they still have the original circular structure so today when you're going to Cathedral you have this long passage and you have the circle at least as a window which is known as the solar window and the giant pillars which separate at the side\n\n(1:09:54) chambers represent the same as the stones of Stonehenge it's also interesting that the great places of Sun worship today lie on what is called ley lines so if you took a line and you stretched it from Stonehenge it would go through Paris through Rome through the pyramids to Mecca in one straight line\n\n(1:10:17) the principal places of Sun worship fascinating story of course in the cathedrals you'll find the gargoyles and all these interesting things so the symbols and feasts in France summer solstice jumping of the fire and the feast of son John 19th century engraving jumping through the fire things that they do today at the Feast of cynjohn\n\n(1:10:39) they still today light the fire symbolizing the victory of the Sun God today it's called the festival of son John and if you go into the Eastern religions you'll find every single one of their little movements their hand movements their dances are all son rituals and you'll notice that this hand movement over here\n\n(1:11:02) where he stands like this this is an ancient pagan symbol and the papacy uses it as a blessing if you go through Masonic rituals you'll find that certain Masonic organizations uses as well no anyone who has to make an oath this way Boy Scouts for example make an oath this way pagan systems of Sun worship used by\n\n(1:11:31) the papacy and all of these so the dragon persecuted the woman which brought brought forth the manchild and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the wilderness can you see how Satan adopts all the symbols that God has for himself is everything basically is just nothing\n\n(1:11:57) but a copycat that you might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time times and half a time from the face of the Serpent's 538 to 1798 the vol dances the owl begins as the Hyuga knows they escaped from her wrath as many as could the others were relentlessly slaughtered the Valdez's in\n\n(1:12:22) the valdivian Valley faithful men and women of God kept the lamp of truth burning but their crowning offence was their love and reverence for Scripture and their burning zeal to make converts but many of them had the whole of the New Testament by heart surely if ever there was a god-fearing people it was\n\n(1:12:39) these unfortunates under the banner of church and state the sign of a door discerning worthy of death was that he followed Christ and sought to obey the commandments of God there is an interesting point this was contrary to the law of God so the valdine says were persecuted and this comes from the history of the Inquisition of the Middle\n\n(1:13:02) Ages this is historic work great numbers were driven from their habitations with their wives and children stripped them naked many of them in humanely massacred they took the little children they bashed their heads against the rock typical read the Jesuit Oats and you will see what they did to them they\n\n(1:13:20) herded them into caves and made fires and roasted them alive they were really mean mean to them and many of them were slaughtered and captive and the Inquisition can really talk about all that were Harris heretics deciding for oneself what one shall believe and practice thank God I don't serve a god\n\n(1:13:42) like that therefore by this present apostolic writing we give you a strict command that by by whatever means you can you destroy all these heresies and destroy them from your diocese all who are polluted by them you shall exercise the ecclesiastical power against them and all who have made themselves\n\n(1:13:58) suspected by associated with them they may not appeal against your judgments and if necessary you may cause the princess and the people to suppress them with the sword that's what happened that's history so the dragon persecuted the woman and Publio had this medallion a printed or pressed where he has the\n\n(1:14:19) woman with a cup in her hand Phyllis on the back and today there are just some remnants in the Val densey and valleys of how these people lived and what they did in high up out of reach places and the church proudly showed Loyola the Jesuit founder slaughtering the opposition the two that are at the base\n\n(1:14:44) of his sword Luther and Calvin they harried them out of the land Johannes he was one of the first heralds first he was not allowed to say the mass and he was only allowed to speak which was a blessing and from this very pulpit all he could do was preach the Word of God marvelous so all the liturgy fell\n\n(1:15:07) away and the Word of God was made perfect and he called the papacy Babylon the king of Babylon this was his original Church there was his pew and up against the wall he had the poster of the Pope riding on a great horse and then he had another poster of Jesus on a donkey and he says who is mightier the servant or the\n\n(1:15:37) master interesting questions well he died at the stake for his troubles and was betrayed and here they hung up the bodies of those that refuted them these are the Hyuga no monuments we've discussed those so the Martin Luther's and the Milan tongs this one the fiery one this one the gentle one sometimes\n\n(1:15:58) you need people like Peter sometimes you need people like John Martin Luther John Wycliffe John ox Tyndall Calvin these were the great preachers and the serpent cast out his mouth water as a flood after the woman so what did he use he used the nations of the world to persecute he use particularly frogs\n\n(1:16:21) frogs we'll have a tremendous account to give one day verse 15 said and he said revelation 17 15 declares and he says unto me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's multitudes nations tongues we don't have to guess so the nations were sent to persecute God's people but the earth where there was no\n\n(1:16:50) water opened up its place so they fled they came to the United States they are living right here in this country today the offspring of these brave people they went to Africa they started a new life and their symbol represents freedom but unfortunately with a bite in it its Masonic and the dragon was wroth with\n\n(1:17:14) the woman and he went to make war with the remnant of her seed now this woman fled into the wilderness for 1260 days that League brings us up to the date 1798 and she flees into the solitary places and the new world is populated and Protestantism takes hold in the new world and out of this Protestantism and\n\n(1:17:46) new remnant arises and the dragon was wroth with the woman with the church and then he went to make war with the remnant of her seed now who are they well isn't attribute which keeps the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ there's the clue and we will have to find out from the Bible who the sees I'd like to know\n\n(1:18:16) who is this remnant that makes the Dragon angry that keeps the commandments of God and has the testimony of Jesus Christ and what does that mean well Daniel says and at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which stands for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was\n\n(1:18:41) since there was a nation even at that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book Wow we are living in the very end of time the woman of the wilderness is over the dragon is now ruts with the remnant of her seed they that keep the commandments\n\n(1:19:05) of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus but Michael will stand up before he can destroy them and I will destroy the eoq covering cherub therefore will I bring forth a fire in the midst of thee and I shall devour thee and I will bring me to ashes upon the earth Ezekiel 28 16 and 18 this battle between these two\n\n(1:19:32) gigantic forces Michael and his angels and his church the woman and Satan and his angels and his church the of Babylon those two are going to come into a final clash and it would be interesting to know whether both sides can identify the other that would be exciting what if the one side literally said that's them we'll see blessed are\n\n(1:20:06) they that do His commandments that they may have the right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city revelation 22:14 so it's really worth it to keep the commandments of God not to earn your place in heaven but because you choose to obey God rather than man that's the crux of the matter\n\n(1:20:32) it's a question of obedience or of love not obedience to gain something to gain something the Bible says godly sorrow leads to repentance but is a sorrow which does not lead to repentance what's the difference between those two the sorrow that does not lead to repentance is a sorrow of the loss not over what you have done a sorrow\n\n(1:21:04) that leads to repentance is a sorrow that leads to the acknowledgment that I am at fault and I have a problem and I am in need of a savior now when I have recognized him Jesus Christ and I take hold of him and I am empowered by him to start cleaning up the act and doing what is right it is he that does it not me\n\n(1:21:31) and it is by His grace that I am saved and not by my works so yes they keep the commandments but not to earn their way to heaven but rather because they admire and honor their Savior their oedema to systems at war a dragon and a woman in white and the attributes they keep the commandments of God and they hold to the\n\n(1:22:00) testimony of Jesus Ephesians 4 verse 4 and 5 says there is one body one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called one Lord one faith one baptism all these thousands of faith that lead to heaven or one one and only one and tonight we will have to make a decision which side we are going to be\n\n(1:22:29) on either the one or the other and of course we will have to know more details before we can understand the full relevance of this mighty battle between these two ideological systems the one says you will obey man the other one says you will obey God and those two systems are going to clash in tomorrow\n\n(1:22:52) night's lectures we're going to put it on the table let the Bible do the talking and we're going to go straight to the hub of the matter and then we will see in the subsequent lectures exactly who's making war on who what the final outcome will be and what the intervention of God is going to be like\n\n(1:23:15) in the Bible we're going to do those fantastic chapters Revelation chapter 10 Revelation chapter 14 12 and 13 we've already done we're going to do the final chapters the restoration of all things don't miss it because this is what the final answer is without it you will only know what's bad but you won't know what\n\n(1:23:40) the solution to the problem is so god bless you and keep you as you ponder these things and see you tomorrow [Music]

  "# Title:228_a_stone_to_rest_your_head_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nBiblical Prophecy Interpretation,The Sanctuary Message,God's Remnant Church,Worldwide Evangelism,The Sabbath Commandment\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, \"A Stone to Rest Your Head,\" delves into complex biblical prophecies, primarily from the books of Daniel and Revelation, to trace the history of God's people and the rise of a distinct \"remnant church\" in the end times. The speaker emphasizes the centrality of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, whom Peter recognized as \"the rock of all ages.\" A key focus is the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14, which, when interpreted as years, points to 1844 and a \"cleansing of the sanctuary\"â€”a period of judgment and a shift in Christ's heavenly ministry. This prophecy was sealed until \"the time of the end,\" which the speaker identifies as beginning after 1798. The lecture also highlights three distinguishing characteristics of this remnant church: keeping God's commandments, possessing the \"testimony of Jesus\" (identified as the \"spirit of prophecy\"), and having the \"faith of Jesus.\" The speaker contends that only one Christian denomination meets these criteria and preaches the \"three angels' messages\" (Revelation 14:6-12) of judgment, the fall of Babylon, and not receiving the mark of the beast, on a worldwide scale, thereby preparing people for Christ's imminent return amidst a world increasingly advocating for ecumenical unity.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 228 - A Stone to Rest Your Head _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N6gT0BVt5g\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] well this lecture is a strange name it's titled a stone to lift your head and it's not a rock it's a stone but Peter had a relationship with Jesus and Peter recognized that Jesus was the rock of all ages he was the ultimate stone on this planet and so we need to recognize\n\n(01:33) is that we need to have a relationship with Jesus Christ now this lecture starts with an interesting prophecy and to 2300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Daniel 8 14 now the full extent of this prophecy is one that is incredibly important in the world and as you will know that the 70 weeks portion\n\n(02:03) of that property of that prophecy has actually been cursed by rabbinical societies because it points to the Messiah to Jesus Christ as the only one actually the prophecy starts from the going forth of the decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem and a decree went out when after sexist made that decree in\n\n(02:29) 457 b c and then it gives the exact time periods of the restoration of Israel and it gives the exact time period as to when the messiah the prince would come and also the week of his sacrificial death all of those are included in this fantastic prophecy and as a portion of the prophecy cut off for the Jews but\n\n(02:57) the prophecy continues for 2300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed as you take 2300 day years when you get to a date 1844 with which we I cannot do much unless we understand some of the principles involved but there's our lecture coming which is called 1844 and the final onslaught will be dealing with more of those issues in\n\n(03:26) that lecture so the cleansing of the sanctuary what is this entail and what is this got to do who was the study that we're dealing with tonight well daniel chapter 8 verse 17 tells us a little bit of about this so he came near where I stood and when he came I was afraid and fell upon my face and he said unto me\n\n(03:49) understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision so this vision that Daniel got didn't concern his time this is the 2300 evening morning portion of the prophecy didn't concern his time it concerns the time of the end not the end of time the time of the end so when at this time of the end\n\n(04:16) starts and what is this prophecy tell us daniel 8 verse 26 and the vision of the evening and morning that's the 2300 a prophecy which was told is true wherefore shut dow up the vision for it shall be for many days so this vision of the 2300 evening morning's is shut up it is a sealed vision it is a closed vision\n\n(04:48) not to be understood until the time of the end for at the time of the end shall be the vision so the decree to rebuild Jerusalem as I said went out in 457 bc they were actually three decreased but only one decree link complete political freedom as well as the reconstruction of Jerusalem all the other decrease had\n\n(05:19) only been there for the temple so this is the only one that we could take and he said unto me unto 2003 days then shall the sanctuary to be cleanse now what is this century is that shall be clean daniel 8 14 the 2300 year prophecy there was a time period which was called the seventy week prophecy seventy times seven days four hundred\n\n(05:48) and ninety days 490 years if we started with 457 bc that ends in 34 ad and it's divided up in two weeks it's a fantastic prophecy and it tells us that in the middle of the last week he messiah shall put an end to sacrifice and offering the sacrificial system will come to an end and a sacrificial system of course was\n\n(06:16) the type of his own sacrifice so when Jesus dies that sacrifice that sacrificial system comes to an end it is no longer mrs. necessary it just served as a type Ford was going to come well city full ad what happened in 34 ad in city for ad Stephen was stoned and the gospel went to the Gentiles in fact\n\n(06:45) Jesus had said to the disciples go ye first to the last children of Israel so even after the crucifixion there was work done amongst the Jews but then in 34 ad Paul was called and he was to be the apostle to the Gentiles Peter had a vision at that time where he was taken to camellia who was a non-jew and it was\n\n(07:15) very reluctant to go but God gave him a vision of unclean animals in the Sheep coming down and Peter interprets this vision in front of Cornelius in Acts chapter 10 and says to him God has shown me that a I may not call any and unclean so the gospel now went to the gentle but this vision continues and\n\n(07:43) it ends if you add it all together in 1844 now the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the fact that the first part of the prophecy is fulfilled to the letter tells us that this last part of the prophecy must be more than interesting to us but Daniel didn't understand the vision and he was told\n\n(08:06) that it was sealed unto the time of the end now the cleansing of the sanctuary the earthly sanctuary took place at the end of the Jewish year it was a day of judgement symbolizing the final judgment today they call it young people and young people symbolized this cleansing now we'll be dealing with this in\n\n(08:31) greater detail the high priest went into the most holy the high priest then when he came out of the most holy made atonement for the entire sanctuary cleansing it of the recorded iniquities that means awesome that was recorded was in typed removed from the sanctuary so in other words even though record of sin\n\n(09:00) was removed that means that we deemed the redeemed will stand before God one day as though they had never sinned they will not even be a record of their sin so complete is the redemption in Christ so since 1844 is this is a cleansing of the sanctuary in an anti typical sense we have been living in what the Bible\n\n(09:27) calls God's judgment hour and since 1844 there have been some thunderous events on this planet which really need to be talked about now when was this vision to be unsealed Daniel 12 verse 1 and at that time shall might all stand up now we've already seen this in the lecture yesterday the Great Prince which stands for the children of\n\n(09:53) thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation so right at the end of time there will come a very trouble as time to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book so some time after this event is this\n\n(10:17) planet as we know it will come to an end and something will take its place they will be delivered Daniel 12 verse 4 but now Oh Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased obviously the main knowledge here is knowledge about the\n\n(10:45) Word of God shall increase here in the time of the end to make all these things understandable in a another sense knowledge also of course increased in a literal sense Daniel 12 verse 7 a-9 it shall be for a time times and half a time not that you should recognize by now from the many times that we've dealt\n\n(11:11) with it and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things will be finished okay fascinating what does this tell us well the whole of Daniel the chapter deals was a battle between good and evil and here was to be this antichrist system in Daniel chapter 7 we\n\n(11:37) have all the details of that that arises and for 1260 years or 1260 prophetic days or 42 prophetic months or three and a half prophetic years this system will scatter the same this is a reference to the period where the Roman system controlled the religious sphere on this planet and persecuted God's people and\n\n(12:11) scattered them so for a time times and half a time when he man of sin shall have accomplished to scatter as the power of the holy people which is exactly what he did all these things will be finished so when it's this time of the end when does it arrive sometime after 1798 because this power did this\n\n(12:36) from 538 ad to 1798 when bad Pierre's field of the system and called it quits and said this system has now come to an end the papal power was restricted and he said go thy way Daniel for the words are closed up and filled till the time of the end so the time of the end starts after 1798 so go your way Daniel the\n\n(13:06) words of clothes and fields till the time of the end obviously the time of the end begins after the time times and half a time so sometime around 1798 something must happen to counteract this system Matthew 24 21 and 22 for then shall be Great Tribulation such as not wise since the beginning of the world to\n\n(13:30) this time nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened this is actually a reference here in Matthew 24 to that 1260 day period which was to be this terrible Tribulation Period which will be followed later by a time of great\n\n(13:59) trouble which is the worst that will ever have been on this planet but this time period is very prominent as 1260 day period is repeated seven times in the book of Revelation as a period of great nightmare but God shortens the time of darkness how did he do it do you remember what he did to shorten the time of darkness he brought\n\n(14:25) about the Reformation so instead of this darkness had in total control for 1260 years the Reformation cut the time short and spread light but this system was determined to conquer the Reformation and we saw how it went all out to do that if God has not done that if you had not brought about the Reformation and\n\n(14:51) then everything would have been I've already nobody would be saved because then all life on this planet would have been extinguished but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened weh licky history in the lives of rationalism in Europe says the Church of Rome has shed more innocent blood than\n\n(15:12) any other institution that ever existed it is impossible to form a complete conception of the multitude of her victims this is just a sad fact and it would have wiped out all vestiges of truth if God had not done something these are the great monuments of the Reformers many of them died at the stake\n\n(15:33) but they were determined to speak the Word of God and to make the Word of God available to all people then mark chapter 13 verse 20 forces after those days or in those days after that tribulation this period that he's mentioned seven times in the Bible in this period after that tribulation the Sun shall be darkened and the moon shall\n\n(16:05) not give her light there will be celestial signs mark 13 verse 24 now who would those celestial signs before for those who do not know the Bible or for those who do know the Bible obviously for those who do know the Bible but they had been scattered they had been scattered the Bible says in Daniel when he is this Antichrist system will\n\n(16:34) have succeeded to scatter the power of the holy people where did they scatter to where did the Reformation scatter to where was it it was in the New World it had escaped and the bulk of it the bastion of the Protestant world had come to this continent that I'm standing on right now it had come to North America\n\n(16:58) that's where the bulk were there were patches in southern Africa there were patches in the new world Australia and New Zealand but the bulk of it the power was here so wouldn't they be the one to be able to interpret these signs the best mark 13 verse 24 relation 6 12 and 13 says exactly the same thing and I and\n\n(17:27) beheld when he had opened the sixth seal now remember we went through the fields and each one of the fields represents a time period in history and the opening of the seventh seal is the coming of Christ every time the final one the seventh one is the culmination of all things the coming of Christ so here when\n\n(17:48) he opened the sixth seal below there was a great earthquake we have an earthquake the Sun became black as sackcloth it was a darkening of the Sun the moon became as blood the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind revelation 6 12 and 13\n\n(18:12) exactly the same that Jesus had said would happen after the tribulation of those days the Sun will be darkened well whilst they such a day Rhonda Baptist period round about the end of the 1260 days yes there was a great earthquake one of the strangest earthquakes of all time the great lissabon is quiet in fact that was an earthquake\n\n(18:38) that was felt into the southern hemisphere a very strange earthquake and then the dog day of New England so familiar to old and young came a nineteen seventeen hundred and eighty near eleven o'clock it began to draw dark as if nights were coming men ceased their worth the loving cattle came to the bonds the bleating sheep huddled by\n\n(19:00) the fences the wild bird screamed and flew to their nest the fowls went to their roost at night it was so inky dark that a person could not see his hand when held up nor even a white sheet of paper history of where New Hampshire 1735 to 1888 Boston Public Library it's a fact the independent Chronicle said\n\n(19:23) during the whole time a sickly melancholy gloom of across the face of nature nor was the darkness of the night less uncommon and terrifying than that of the day notwithstanding there was almost a full moon no object was discernible but the help of some artificial light which when seen from the neighboring houses and other places\n\n(19:43) that a distance appears through a kind of Egyptian darkness which seemed eaten pervious to the rain this was a very strange for Nolan with your historic facts these are not Christians writing that's the newspaper great memorable events the Connecticut legislature was in session at the time so great was the\n\n(20:04) darkness that members became terrified and thought the day of judgment had come emotion was consequently made to adjourn and then Herschel the great astronomer frankly admits the dark day may nineteen seventeen eighty is one of those wonderful phenomenal nature which will always be read with interest but which\n\n(20:24) philosophy science is at a loss to explain there was no eclipse there was no reason why they should have been such an event but it happened and that night the moon was blood red but didn't give off any light you could see it was a full moon there was no light It was as if the Sun had been darkened and the\n\n(20:48) could not reflect its light and then the stars of heaven fell to earth November 13 1833 so in the right sequence there was an earthquake then there was a darkening of the Sun the moon became as blood and now there was this strange event of this massive meteor shower November 13 1833 200,000 meteors an hour\n\n(21:15) there were so many meteors you could read at night with the lights of the meteors but the interesting fact is that didn't really happen like it looks over here the meteos seemed to come from a central point and spread over the sky with whereas normally meteos just fall haphazardly so there was marvelous\n\n(21:37) celestial signs which was seen by bible-believing student on this continent and at that time a man by the name of William Miller started preaching an interesting message William Ellis 1782 to 18-49 now remember that this prophecy would be unsealed at the time of the end after the 1260 day prophecy comes to an end of three and a half\n\n(22:09) years and he clamped on to 2300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed and he started working up this prophecy of the 2300 years which had not been done before nobody had ever done that and he has suddenly comes a man and he does this and in the Book of Daniel it says is this will be understood in the time\n\n(22:34) of the end and he worked up well this prophecy comes to 1844 then shall the sanctuary be cleansed what does that mean then he wrecked his brain and he didn't know what it meant and so he figured well maybe the Earth's will be cleansed then how would that be interpreted when will the earth be cleansed when Christ comes again so he\n\n(22:59) says well maybe in 1840 all Christ will come again but of course there's another verse which says nobody knows the day or the hour but having studied this and found that the first part of the prophecy relevant to Christ is an absolute fulfillment that even Peaks the Jewish knowledge and made them give a curse or a decree against the\n\n(23:30) study of that portion of Scripture well then maybe the rest of the prophecy was somehow very relevant and he started preaching on this issue now if it understood the sanctuary part of it well then he would might have related it to the earthly sanctuary which served as a type in the Bible for the heavenly\n\n(23:52) sanctuary and so you might have then come to the conclusion that in 1844 there is a shift in emphasis to a time of judgment in other words the evil side gets its time to set up a kingdom and this is a the final judgment period almost like an antique typical young people and then at the same time there\n\n(24:17) will be a counter message so in the 1840s a group of people that call themselves advent believers that means they believe that the coming of Christ was imminent and that he would come in 1844 sometime then and when he didn't come they were deeply disappointed now who were these Advent believers they\n\n(24:42) were Christians from every single denomination of Christendom existing at that time in fact they incorporated some 200 ministers of religion with large parts of their congregations who were waiting for this coming of Christ and they were actually marked but they based their decision on a study by Miller\n\n(25:10) which sounded very solid biblically prophetically of course Christ didn't come and there was a great disappointment and this movement sort of dissipated except for a call which continued to study the Bible now if God has a church how can we find it what do people say now if you really think about it should it be that difficult what\n\n(25:38) should be the standard for Christianity to determine or whether somebody is telling the truth in all aspects yes or no what should be the standard the Bible okay so the Bible is the standard so now let's take the Bible as a standard and we go to denomination X and we ask a couple of questions what do you teach\n\n(26:04) regarding whatever it is let's say baptism what do you teach regarding baptism well if you come to one denomination they will say we believe in infant baptism other denominations like that today yes and some of them will say we believe in baptism by immersing the infant there are some groups that do\n\n(26:31) that others will say we believe in baptism by infusion pouring the water over the head others will say when we believe in baptism by sprinkling and others will say that is for example we believe in baptism by immersion of adults some denominations say immersion one other denominations say immersion three times in the name of the Father\n\n(27:05) the Son and the Holy Spirit so which one is right or they will like or is it okay does it make a difference what do you do well shouldn't it be simple matter to go to the Bible and see well how was it done in the Bible and then follow the Bible by the letter yes or no okay what is the doctrine on let's say the\n\n(27:29) Antichrist well the old reformers they were all one on this issue they pointed to Rome every single one of them Luther said so Calvin said so not set sir swingley said so who said so they all said that today they don't today they have different doctrines the one says we believe in futurism that is that the\n\n(27:55) Antichrist will come in the future sometime in the distant future when the church has already been raptured is there other denominations like that certainly our great bulk of them say that some of them will say no no no the Antichrist was in the past he existed in the time of Greece and he was a Greek\n\n(28:17) king by the name of Antiochus IV farmers for now daniel says he comes out of the fourth Kingdom so he couldn't have come out of this third kingdom so here is a confusion so now it gets even more confusing sometimes the same denomination teaches both the same denomination teachers both that's really confusing now the training of the\n\n(28:46) ministers for example teachers that preacher ISM is the way it was he came out of the pot in the past in the time of Greece but the denomination is taught futurism he comes in the future now why is that because of the bulk of the opinion owing to the other movement is swinging towards futurism because that's\n\n(29:11) more interesting you see then something is so bound to happen free tourism is boring because then it's already happened do you understand the point so they teach those how can you teach both that he came in the past but he's coming in the future doesn't make any sense and so we have all these doctrines shouldn't\n\n(29:29) it be a simple matter to go to the Bible and say well what does the Bible say and then stick to the Bible and eventually somebody will have to give up the pet rock somewhere along the line and come back into line with the Bible yes or no okay so which one is the true church well my opinion would be the one that sticks to\n\n(29:51) the Bible 100% the book of Revelation actually reveals the characteristics of the three minute and you remember yesterday we talked about this woman in white I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman Jeremiah 62 sound to Zion thou at my people as I 5116 so the Church of God is\n\n(30:17) related to this delicate woman I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy either spouse q21 husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin virgin to Christ 1 Corinthians 11 to the woman the church remember in Revelation 12 verse 6 the woman fled into the wilderness where she had a place prepared to God that she\n\n(30:41) should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days valleys the 1260 year period where Rome was persecuting and scattering the people of God and most of them came to this continent and here found solace in the dry areas not many nations and peoples and tongues to persecutor and after that\n\n(31:07) period what was to happen we discussed it last night verse 13 and when the dragon saw that he was Causton to earth he persecuted the woman the woman were given two wings flying to the wilderness place knowledge for time times and half a time from the face of the serpent and then what gate have we got there 1798\n\n(31:31) after the time times and half a time and then the serpent costs out of his mouth water was that nation against nation as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood let's help the woman we have opened the mouth swallowed up the flood which was glenum cast out of the last\n\n(31:52) the dragon was wroth with a woman and he went to make war with a remnant of her seed he is the first attribute which keep the commandments of God second attribute have the testimony of Jesus so what is the remnant obviously a remnant is something that remain it looks like the original so if the original was a\n\n(32:15) bible-believing group the leading and salvation in Christ and Christ alone then the remnant must have that same appeal except that it also has this sharp attribute that it keeps the commandments which some of the previous ones also did of our dancers kept all the commandments and was persecuted for example on the Sabbath issue so God's\n\n(32:40) church would arrive sometime after 1798 in a land of political and religious freedom here is the patience of the saints revelation 14 12 here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus notice it doesn't say faith in Jesus it says faith of Jesus which is much more than faith in Jesus\n\n(33:04) it means having the same trust and Reliance in Jesus as Jesus had in his father that's what it means it means a very strong relationship with Jesus Christ blessed are they that do His commandments that they may have the right to the Tree of Life and may enter in through the gates into the city revelation 22 14 this implies that the\n\n(33:31) commandments are going to become a test in the last days and that it will make a distinction between those who follow God and those who don't it doesn't necessarily mean that you will be saved because you keep the commandments it simply means that they will be this distinction so blessed are those that do\n\n(33:52) His commandments not just say but actually do His commandments that they may have the right to enter in if you love me keep my Commandments John 14 verse 15 you know John chapter 14 is a fantastic chapter it starts off with let not your hearts be troubled doesn't do that it says in my father's house are\n\n(34:20) many mansions I go to prepare a place for you and then it says I will come again to take you to be where I am also that's the Blessed out the coming and the return of Jesus Christ and then in the same chapter it says if you love me thank you my Commandments those are the two attributes which are central to\n\n(34:46) faith in Christ obedience to him shows that you acknowledge him as your king and the fact that is coming again must be your hope the Blessed hope Paul causeless so obedience and waiting for the coming of crop so the two distinguishing characteristics of God's remnant church are it keeps the commandments of God does that make any\n\n(35:13) sense wrecker is a biblical number two it has to testimony of Jesus we don't know what that easiest but it has it right whatever that is it has that so question what is the testimony of Jesus well let's our survival now John is in vision and the angel comes to him and informs him and he falls at the feet of\n\n(35:37) this angel to worship Him and this angel says to him see that out to it not I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren that has the testimony of Jesus so you cannot worship an angel so here we have have the testimony of Jesus who worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy you have the\n\n(36:05) definition okay the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy what does that mean revelation 19 verse 10 so that's an attribute we'll have to discuss in some retail so God's last-day church would keep the commandments and have the gift of prophecy when Jesus ascended to heaven to stabilize this church the\n\n(36:29) Bible says he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors teachers Ephesians 4 11 if this was what the church needed in the beginning of its ministry surely it will need it at the end of its ministry as well doesn't that make sense even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you so that you\n\n(36:50) come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ 1 Corinthians 167 all the gifts must be there so the Bible predicts the gift of prophecy will be restored to God's church in the last day surely the Lord God will do nothing the body reveal atif secret unto his servants the prophets\n\n(37:12) Amos 3 verse 7 so if Wyclef discovered the authority of the Bible and who discovered obedience to God and Luther discovered salvation by grace and Calvin discovered freedom of conscience and Williams discovered baptism by immersion all of which are biblical and weirdly discovered lordship of Christ then\n\n(37:46) Miller discovered again the hope of the Second Coming which is the hope of the church and miller also discovered prophecy as an important guideline can prophecy save me yes or no no I can know everything about prophecy and it won't do one thing to save me but what can prophecy do can tell me where I am in\n\n(38:15) the stream of time and prophecy can show me that the Bible is trustworthy if you take the prophecies in the Bible who the prophecy of tire for example will fall to the letter to the letter including sweeping it off the face of the earth and the whole city into the sea including its dust that's a tough prophecy to\n\n(38:37) fulfill make no mistake somebody said to you today Vancouver will be swept off the land dumped into the sea and even the dust will be used and thrown into the ocean you would say well this man is slightly more sugar right he has lost it but that prophecy was fulfilled to the letter or prophecy will be fulfilled to\n\n(39:00) the letter and then there must be a final restoration under the guidance of the spirit of prophecy which encompasses all truth it wouldn't that be logical that would be a logical thing but what if this organization or this truth comes into contact with all the others that will not move further than their\n\n(39:21) founders and then unfortunately have a clash with all of them all of them now Revelation chapter 10 is this marvelous chapter culminating you within this 6th trumpet where you have this one power meeting the power that comes out of the bottomless pit so out of the bottomless pit comes a power that is to take over\n\n(39:48) the whole earth and at the same time something else to rise it they used to counteract that power let's see Revelation chapter 10 and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face were as it were the Sun ezekiel had a similar vision Daniel had a similar vision this\n\n(40:14) is a prophecy that deals with something important because Christ himself going to tell us what it's all about and he had any hand a little book open that's fascinating and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not seven thunders the\n\n(40:39) voice of God if you like over all seasons and he had any ten a book and a shield interesting where in the Bible do we read about a sealed scroll Daniel in fact Daniels 2300 evening morning prophecy is the only prophecy in the whole of the Bible that field and it's sealed unto when the time of the end as we were studying the book of\n\n(41:12) Revelation every time we come to the 6th period then we go into the time period of the 1798 isn't that interesting that's exactly the right time period and the French Revolution revelation shop they live in the power that comes from the bottomless pit that makes war against God's Word and against God's\n\n(41:35) truth all of these issues happen around that date here's a counter God says is a scroll in my hand seal up the things which the seven thunders I didn't write them not and angel which I saw stand upon the sea and the earth lifted up his hand to heaven to swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created\n\n(41:57) heaven and the things they're in in all and the earth and the things that they're in all and a fee and the things which cell in our why is that that's the feel of God that's the seal of God he created heavens the things that they are in the earth the things that are therein to see the things that are therein and\n\n(42:21) where do we find that portion of Scripture in the Old Testament in which commandment and a fourth commandment which gives validity to the whole law because it was the seal of his authority I make this law because I am the creator of heaven and earth to sea and all that in the meal so the seal of God appears\n\n(42:47) here and there should be time no longer what time I'll it's the end of time as some interpreted or it means no more pro set it time what was the longest time prophecy in the Bible the 2300 evening morning ones and this time period was now coming to an end and here was a book and it was open obviously it had been\n\n(43:16) closed and sealed what is going to happen to the scroll now the 2300 evening morning ones is the only one that was filled what's going to happen to it well he says to the Prophet go and take a little book which is not open which is open in the hand of the angel take it and eat it up okay what does that mean internalizes put it inside you\n\n(43:40) and it shall make I belly better but it shall be in my mouth of sweet as honey question what comes first when you eat something the mouth of the stomach the mouse comes first and then comes the stomach so when he's internalizing the scroll which is the word of God Chris sweet and then will do sir all right and\n\n(44:08) I took the little book out of the Angels hands and ate it up and it was in my mouth of sweetest honey just to see it set and as soon as I had eaten it touches to this is where you internalize it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and\n\n(44:33) kings whoa that's interesting so this new commission over here is a worldwide commission many peoples and nations and tongues and kings are worldwide Commission now why prophesied again is it possible that once you have eaten this book once you have internalized the prophecy that you might think wow this\n\n(44:59) is sweet news something's going to happen that will end all trouble here on earth and then it doesn't happen and you find you have to Drudge on you have to do it again that's interesting and then still too many peoples and nations and tongues and kings well let's have a look at Jeremiah 15 verse 16 thy words were found and I\n\n(45:23) did eat them and I word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart for I am called by thy name o Lord God of hosts so eating the Word of God can bring joy Ezekiel chapter 3 verse 3 and 4 he said unto me son of man caused by Bailey to eat and full thy bowels with this role this is not a bread roll by the way this\n\n(45:48) is a scroll a book that I give me then did I eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness and he said unto me son of man go get the into the house of Israel and speak with my words unto them everybody understands now what it means to eat the Word of God means to internalize it understand it and then go\n\n(46:08) and preach it now Jake y'all got the Commission to preach to Israel alone this previous Commission was to preach to whom all the nations the peoples languages in the tongue that was the previous Commission so here was an internal Commission a scroll was to be understood and it was to be preached okay now remember in 1844 around about\n\n(46:35) that date mullah had preached it seems to me that the 2300 day prophecy exactly the right time you start studying a book that had been sealed and others book is open and the world Christians come together and they study those remember that over 200 ministers alone from different denominations studied these\n\n(46:56) prophecies and they decided well maybe it means jesus is coming again that's a sweet message maybe we don't ever have to worry about anything they prepared themselves for the coming of the Lord it didn't come and it turns to bitterness in this stomach and many of them disappeared only a call remind and said\n\n(47:20) something's wrong we misunderstood something we list something there must have been a finger over this part of the prophecy that we didn't understand now is this fair of God who is this unfair of God well duty bad feels like this in the past as well for particular reason and the answer is yes revelation can 11 llamas prophesied\n\n(47:45) again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings do you remember when the Jews had crucified Jesus what was the state of the Apostles and the followers of Christ they were dejected destroyed why because they had believed Jesus would never be crucified he will announce himself as the Messiah and the\n\n(48:13) kingdom would come that's a sweet message and it turned to bitterness and grief and here are two men walking on their way to mo their feet dragging along they were so dejected so miserable why because they're sweet expectation had turned to bitterness and then a third one came in amongst them and said\n\n(48:42) to them let me explain to you the scriptures and starting from where from the beginning he explained to them all the prophecies concerning himself it looked wonderful and what happened after they suddenly clicked what happened Wow there he was he came into the home he brought bread and they recognized him\n\n(49:09) and they took off like greased lightning and ran all the way back to Jerusalem away was the lethargy there was spring in the step and they race back with a tremendous message is that correct and suddenly the scriptures were open to them and they understood the prophecies concerning Jesus Christ and the truth\n\n(49:35) crystallized in their hearts and they went off with power that's what happens there why was this great tribulation if you like this Great Britain is permitted well there were many many hangers on that were following Christ for the sake of what getting into this new kingdom that's it but to give up self no way to\n\n(50:00) be ridiculed no way not even Peter could stand the ridicule the ridicule of a woman that said you're one of them to nah not me rather he couldn't stand the ridicule so what was left was a call that had said surely we were not deceived surely this was the son of God somehow we have missed something somewhere and only those that were\n\n(50:27) really sincere remained now when we did the seven churches we came to just before loudest year there was a Philadelphia group and it said you were small in numbers remember a small in number and they were full of love and they were without rebuke that's the little remnant that remains there that had been cleansed through this great\n\n(50:53) disappointment and so 1844 to 2300 days and shoulders century be claimed wow they discovered something the tremendous sanctuary message which is the greatest message of all time the gospel in the Old Testament explaining the Ministry of Christ from A to Z here's the door he's the sacrifice he's the one that washes\n\n(51:18) you the labor he's the one that's the light of the world the menorah he's the bread of the presence he is the incense he is the high priest we have such a high priest all these wonderful things suddenly gel Wow and that earthly sanctuary was cleansed then the heavenly must be cleansed that means 1844 doesn't\n\n(51:41) mean Christ is coming this means we're the time of judgment people must make a decision they must go a message of judgment and repentance to the world to every nation tribe and tongue you see the sanctuary is a mini presentation of the plan of salvation a beautiful message and it takes a whole lecture to\n\n(52:07) explain that what must be prophesied again what is it what is the message that must go to the world in this time of conflict when Satan is setting up his kingdom and I saw another angel flying limits of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and\n\n(52:31) kindred and tongue and people there's a message that must go out again 50 is an everlasting gospel matter hast gospel a hoss gospel says you are saved by your obedience that's what the Jews taught modern Christianity you are saved by Jesus stands on one leg and you don't have to do anything you know have to be\n\n(52:54) obedience the laws been done away with do whatever you please is the whole of the law as long as you say I love Jesus you're okay but the everlasting gospel required obedience as well as recognizing that without Christ we are nothing everlasting gospel so it has both component saved by the blood of the\n\n(53:18) Lamb and as a consequence if you love him keep the commandments that make sense fear God give glory to him for the hour of his judgment has come there we go young people worship Him that made the heavens the earth to see in the thousands of water so at the same time a message goes out into the world worships\n\n(53:41) the god of evolution you come from the slime pit same time another message no why should he mermaid the heavens the earth and the thousands of water so the three angels messages going to the world the hour of judgment has come Babylon has fallen and do not accept the mark of the beast and we've dealt with\n\n(54:02) these issues that's what has to be preached to the entire world so this organization has to be a worldwide movement it cannot be a local organization Matthew 24 14 also scissors and this gospel of the kingdom not the kingdom of this earth that he's being set up by the United Nations and by Rome no no no the kingdom of God shall be\n\n(54:31) preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come has to be a universal message otherwise it doesn't work and Jesus Kate came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of\n\n(54:49) the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost all power is in Christ not in some earthly representative of Christ valid worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created revelation 4 11 not the slime pit of evolution Jesus Christ gets\n\n(55:13) the honor of being the creator of this universe here is the patience of the Saints it's going to be a battle here are they that keep the commandments of God in the face of Jesus if you keep the Sabbath what are you saying to the world I believe that God created the world in six days for in six days the Lord made\n\n(55:40) the heavens the earth the sea and all that in the Medes therefore the Lord God commanded you to keep holy the Sabbath day see yes I just have to keep the Sabbath and I am in the throat of world philosophy in the throat thou Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time the end many shall run to and fro trying\n\n(56:11) to understand the prophecies but knowledge shall be increased it will be understood at the end of time this gift will once again come to a fall so in the same time period as God raises up this counter movement to face the world you have Freemasonry coming in the world demoting Jesus Christ you have spiritualism teaching there is no death\n\n(56:35) life continues forever you have theosophy which teaches that Lucifer is the true son of God you have all kinds of false prophets we've dealt with them you have the Joseph Smith's you have the Blavatsky you have the Alice a Bailey's and they write forms of books which are the literature of the great institutions\n\n(56:56) of this world the United Nations acknowledges this literature as the function of its resources the Mormon movement the Jehovah's Witnesses all of these movements in the Mormon movement the priesthood is taken away from Christ and given to man the order of Melchizedek Jovus witnesses chemos jesus christ christian science movement says\n\n(57:19) we are God and we are eternal all these movements arrived at the same time and here's this other little movement and was counteracted and God's message is a message of separation revelation 18 for come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sin and that you receive not of her plagues wherefore\n\n(57:43) come out of among them and be ye separate says the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you 2 Corinthians 6 17 what is the message of the worldly Kingdom inclusiveness come together those who adopt separateness will sooner or later stand expose that's what L say Bailey said and well Robert\n\n(58:10) Miller say the former Under Secretary General of the United Nations if you do not join in if you have a spirit of separateness soon or later you'll come to regret it did me say that so we have a clash of I deal what does this mean to be a command achill the way the communicative arrived from the Greek Tim I commander\n\n(58:29) which may be translated as the whole inhabited world it is in seeing this world is God that we see ourselves as one it isn't seeing all those people is made in the image of God that they are called to protect the welfare of everyone so here is a problem hi kameena comes together separateness priests jail\n\n(58:48) carnal the final object of ecumenism as Catholics conceive it is the unity in the face worship and the acknowledgment of the supreme spiritual authority of the bishop abroad and the other movement says do not accept the mark of the beast Babylon is fallen Babylon is fallen separate yourself separate yourselves\n\n(59:07) Wow is a recipe for disaster and the Bible warns us all the world wondered after the beasts that are going to listen to this message so only individuals will listen the Holy comes with the clouds every eye shall see him revelation 17 a powerful message warn the people one of the people Christ is coming again oh Christ is not coming\n\n(59:31) again we're going to have peace and safety on this planet is beyond the message we're going to set up a kingdom here and Rome will rule and everything will be nice as it was in the Middle Ages dark and miserable well let's have a look at these attributes again it keeps the commandments of god is that\n\n(59:51) biblical right it has the testimony which is the spirit of prophecy which we haven't defined an extraneous but we accept that that's what it must have because the Bible says so and the face of Jesus and you'll have to have faith that jesus is coming again and you must have said that he will save you just\n\n(1:00:12) like he said his father will be there and never leave him nor forsaken it arose out of a great disappointment there was a bitterness with sweetness and a bitterness it preaches three angels messages has to do that on a worldwide basis and it therefore has to be a worldwide movement look at those points\n\n(1:00:36) and tell me if you know they've done on the nation that does that keep their denomination that does best anyone to the Baptist's do it to the Methodists do it to the congregation let's do it give the charismatic do it who does it anyone else do does it well he's one is one denomination one alone and it is a\n\n(1:01:04) worldwide movement in fact they are only two worldwide denominations that call themselves Christian you guess which ones they are we'll talk about that this is Germany as a young man with a radio satellite the biggest satellite evangelism in the world today is run by the church that you're sitting in today\n\n(1:01:26) the biggest satellites evangelism in the world this is Germany institutes in Germany hospital this is also in Germany this is in Rome right in the center of Rome huge institutions other hospitals over there this is Switzerland this is england one of the colleges in England this is the camp meeting held in England\n\n(1:01:51) I was a speaker at this camp meeting or a few thousand people there I have tremendous house ministry said helena hospital adventist hospital loma linda hospital this whole town is basically adventist a health ministry in this in this pharmacy there are no drugs only alternative medicine house medicine this\n\n(1:02:18) is a little health institute up in the mountains in Norway with a little germ with a little health message they bake bread which is not full of chemicals and they supply the whole of Norway the whole of Norway is supplied by this bakery with an alternative bread without any strange disodium acetates or\n\n(1:02:41) whatever noxious compounds there are in it oppressed a school a farm organic farming health farming getting people back to a healthy lifestyle Christ always dealt with the physical needs as well as the spiritual needs and so his people should also take care of the physical needs as well as the spiritual needs how do you\n\n(1:03:08) reorganize the soil so that light will come back into the blonde did you know that the Islanders church is a leader in this field worldwide has a whole organization called audra which sets up organizations that teach people to form that brings relief and all those types of things so that people can sustain\n\n(1:03:31) themselves and be healthy they are in Korea they on the darkest parts of Africa you can go and worship under some trees with them this is one in Zimbabwe this is one in Malawi this is a hospital if you're in Germany and you are a tourist you will receive a list of hospital if you go to Africa for example\n\n(1:03:53) and all that list there will be all the Adventist hospitals every tourist in Germany receives a look and receive a list like this from their tourist agency because they'll say those are the only hospitals we can be pretty sure that you'll be safe because they are hygienic and they take care of you and I'll tell\n\n(1:04:14) you the hospitals in Africa my sons are medical doctors some of them are absolutely horrendous you cannot believe the state that they are in but when you go to the address this once they're clean and ice there's a dental faculty here's another one of the hospitals there's a theological school is a nice\n\n(1:04:35) family I love this family they are so cute look how rich they are can see how modern their clothes are and how nice they are these are really poor people and that's a little house where they live and that's the manner that a nice wife is null and his wife what a dedicated man he goes forth he has no\n\n(1:04:57) money he travels all over the world with nothing and he preaches a message with such power I stayed with him I slipped on the floor laid Matt bed so he slipped on the floor what a wonderful people they are really brothers and sisters I'm really proud of them here I was in Africa preaching in this church I'll tell you\n\n(1:05:19) it's a different thing to preach in Africa it's an amazing thing the service was to start at eleven o'clock you know and this service was to start at nine o'clock there was to be a lecture at nine o'clock by eleven o'clock we only arrived at the church there was a nightmare for me there was not a soul in\n\n(1:05:39) the church message we listed we was supposed to be at- in either not be it they started rocking up at about twelve in Africa sing start when everybody said that's logical why worry about time if he relationships are very often more important to them than time for example while I was traveling with this chat he\n\n(1:06:02) suddenly saw an old lady alongside the road carrying a bag they pulled the car over you should have seen his car this car that it even draws was a miracle I think it actually drove sideways all the way but never lit he starts this guy gets up and he talks to this little lady and then he takes her back and he walked\n\n(1:06:22) with her for half a mile takes her upstairs puts the bag down wherever he's comes back almost an hour later by this time I'm switching when I were in our late for church already he doesn't say a word this is not as mulcher wolf we drive and suddenly is he someone else he stops the corner fillmore what's this\n\n(1:06:43) man doing is he totally nuts gets out of the car talks to this man for about half an hour gets back in the car and so we arrived at the church to outlet and not a soul there of course I'm totally freaked out and they won't even say it and so eventually he came up to me and he says I saw you were switching I said\n\n(1:07:05) yes why he says you thought you know we Africans with strange right and he says you know what I can explain to you what happens because I happen to think like you because I was abandoned as a little child and I was raised by white missionaries so I have a Western mindset in terms of time and I had to learn to\n\n(1:07:28) be like my people again see you see when I saw that little old lady there when she was standing there it would have been rude of me to drive pasta if she saw me and I went out and I got to her and I spoke to her and it would have been rude in my culture if I said I think having a big bad yet will help you\n\n(1:07:49) quickly really known for I am open nihari you don't do that in my culture you say how are you and then you go through the whole chronology how are your kids how's this one how's that one else that one has the next one and finally you get to the point you need help with that bag and then you come down and that's it now you have\n\n(1:08:09) fulfilled your commission and that's more important than time in their culture now in the German culture it's exactly the opposite when you go there you get a minuten plan you know about a minuten flood here you may do this and your prayer may be one minute 45 and a half seconds thereafter a guillotine\n\n(1:08:30) comes on your date now that works well for that culture now which one is God's culture the one or the other I'll tell you what bout both or his culture and we have to understand the different cultures so here we were they just packed the place Utley ventually there was no standing room and they were all\n\n(1:08:52) around the church and they were more outside than inside so I'm list nothing and they stayed till the last lecture was finished who cares when that in so very interesting this is how the bird College beautiful place in Africa and here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of\n\n(1:09:11) God and the faith of Jesus for me this is the only denomination that does all of these things and of course it is a denomination that is frowned upon by many and they say is that effect why is it effect because it teaches everything that every denomination teachers and even includes those things which the founding fathers\n\n(1:09:37) included but refuses to compromise on many of the other issues that seem compromise about you cannot compromise the Word of God do you think this is a perfect Church oh no this is not a perfect Church Jesus describes the perfect Church the last one allowed to see I remember what did he say it was like he said they were blind pretty full\n\n(1:10:03) poor wretched and naked so if you're looking for the perfect Church turned up to this one it in fact has to be blind beautiful poor and wretched that's what it's got to be like so I didn't join this church because of the people in fact if it were for the people I would still be running why did I join it\n\n(1:10:30) because of the truth that it teaches every single doctrine that it has is biblical other people in the church that fight over the doctrines yes but they are established they are there and they are biblical and as long as those doctrines are biblical that's fine by me and other sheep I have which are not of\n\n(1:10:55) this fault them also must I bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fault and one Shepherd John 1060 not 20 fault not a hundred fold not a thousands not 2001 sold one Shepherd Jesus Christ the world is uniting under one Shepherd the Pope in Rome I have no problem if they want to do that but my\n\n(1:11:20) Bible says is one Lord one King and that's Jesus chorus and I will follow him wherever he goes and the Bible also says that loud sara is the last thing on this earth representing God then comes the coming of Christ these are serious issues does this church live up to the biblical criteria does it arise at the right time\n\n(1:11:46) does it preach exactly this message that must be preached to the entire world yes but remember one thing the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus if you want to have peace and quietness then\n\n(1:12:16) don't ever come here because the wrath of the dragon will be an experience that we have I someone started the sermon how's everybody feeling this morning great something wrong with your religion because in this world you will have tribulation you will have all these problems but be of good cheer I have\n\n(1:12:43) overcome the world says Jesus so don't expect a perfect Church expect truth and where there is truth you have people that love the truth and you will find them weather is truth there is loss and there is strike because the dragon hates truth so you will find people that constantly bicker and argue about every\n\n(1:13:11) aspect don't look at the people look at the truth and God will be the only one that you can ultimately rely on one hundred percent so if ever you want to learn to trust and hold on to Jesus Christ and try following the truth it is an amazing experience but as the days of Noah were so also shall be the coming of\n\n(1:13:40) the Son of Man for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in to marriage why is this world eating and drinking isn't everything religion their food religion marrying and giving in to marriage they change relationships like they change shirts and they can change\n\n(1:14:01) churches like they change shut isn't that right you choose a church according to the music hello do you choose your wife according to her blouse until the day that Noah entered the Ark and you not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the Son of man be Matthew 24 37 39 we are\n\n(1:14:28) heading for some trouble of time and we will be be surrounded by issues but don't make this an easy ministry and what was the lots of poor old Noah everybody said no a great job you're doing they're building an ark for all of us can't wait to get into that boat right no they mocked him I'm sure he dragged even some of his kids into that\n\n(1:14:55) awk judging by how they acted after the ark landed so they mocked him and laughed at him do you think truth is popular in the world yes or no so don't expect a popular truth don't expect a popular message go ye therefore and teach all nations teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you to worldwide movement as\n\n(1:15:24) electric gates again which are the only two movements that are worldwide in the world today do you think it's Islam that's not yet worldwide which two movements are worldwide i'll give you the one Roman Catholicism is a worldwide movement in every nation of the surf and there's one other little denomination\n\n(1:15:48) that has that same attribute as the seventh-day adventist church the only one it's the only one the Lutheran's are big but they're only in about 65 countries that's it all nations and lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world Matthew 28 nine 18 and 20 well physical healing as well as spiritual healing thou shalt be call\n\n(1:16:14) the repair of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in it I turned I away thy foot from the Sabbath from doing my pleasure on my holy day and call the Sabbath a delight the holy of the Lord honorable Isaiah 58 12 and 13 the restorer of the breach the law had been breached that must be restored the\n\n(1:16:35) Sabbath must be restored to denominations is American Bible Society and church missions it's very small I just put it there for reference those are all the countries in the world or all the denominations in the world these are all the countries in the world and you'll be executed exit exit it's only\n\n(1:16:56) along one of them of the Protestant ones that the Adventist not the creator of the universe in Genesis 2 13 but the Catholic Church can claim the honor of having granted manopause to his work every seven day that's quite an interesting statement by Rome made in 1969 reason and common sense Demond the\n\n(1:17:17) acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives either Protestantism and the keeping holy of Hector day or catholicity and the keeping of highly of sunday compromise is impossible that's what the Roman Catholic Church wrote already in the Catholic Marine 1893 which Protestant denomination keeps\n\n(1:17:39) Saturday there were two three four five six and slowly they whittled down tasted a bit eventually there is one great opponent to this message sunday is therefore to this day the acknowledged offspring of the Catholic Church it's part of the Holy Ghost without a word of remonstrance from the Protestant world\n\n(1:17:59) except one denomination you may read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation you will find not a single line authorizing the sanctification of Sunday the Scriptures enforce the religious observance of Saturday a day which we never sanctify Cardinal Gibbons the faith of our fathers that's what was it what is run say further the sunday is\n\n(1:18:20) purely creation of the Catholic Church amazing quarterly Catholic course alou sunday there's a law of the Catholic Church alone the observance of sunday the Protestants is and how much they paying spite of themselves to the authority of the Catholic Church these are old Catholic statements the Protestant says\n\n(1:18:36) how can i receive the teachings of an apostate church how we ask can you manage to receive a teachings or your life in direct opposition to your recognized teacher the Bible on the Sabbath question the Christian Sabbath the Catholics are please direct on this issue then they say in Catholic mirror those who follow the Bible as their\n\n(1:18:55) guide the Israelites and the seventh-day adventist have the exclusive weight of evidence on their side while the biblical Protestant is not a word in self-defense for the substitution of sunday for saturday Romy's mocking the Protestant world and then they say the Adventists are the only body of Christians with the Bible as their\n\n(1:19:17) teacher can find no warrant in its pages for the change of day from the 7th to the first hence their Appalachian seventh-day Adventists row knows why we called seventh-day Adventists shouldn't the world the Catholic Church changed the observance of the Sabbath to Sunday by right of the Divine infallible\n\n(1:19:36) authority given to a bio founder Jesus Christ the Protestants craving the Bible to be the only guy defect has no warrant for observing Sunday in this matter the seventh-day adventist is the only consistent Protestant that's the question box Catholic universe williton 1942 Catholic Church says is one\n\n(1:19:57) consistent Protestant left in this world and who do they finger is it seventh-day Adventists I imagine this who stands rebuked now stands rebuke because I changed the law of God and Protestants stand rebuked because they go along with Rome so both groups are going to be angry with whom both groups are going to\n\n(1:20:21) be angry with the seventh-day adventist church why because the seventh-day adventist church the very name rebukes them the very name is irritating seventh day we keep the law of God we try stumble and fall by the grace of God we stumble along but we say this is the truth and we'll try and look up to it by\n\n(1:20:46) the grace of God not saying with perfect number two Adventist we wait for the Blessed hope we're not interested in a worldly kingdom so everybody hates them and they call them a sect well they called Paul's Church of sixth what is sectarian what is the cult where is the cult cult is someone that has an extra\n\n(1:21:12) biblical teaching what's the biggest extra biblical teaching in the world Roman Catholicism is the biggest cult in the whole of this planet Phil is the Adventist Church as its official doctrine is we have no other Creed save the Bible no other creep here is sent Catherine's Catholic Church Sentinel may\n\n(1:21:36) 21 1995 the Cardinal writing what is the Cardinal right people who think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority should logically become civils day Adventists and keep Saturday Holy Catholic Church knows what's the truth is but they tell you we want to pay it you better buy us but launches crusade\n\n(1:21:58) to save sunday make it clear that sunday must not be worse since it must be celebrated as the day of our Lord sale as they Adventist Church says sorry we cannot go along with you the Bible says something else and you know it so no wonder at the 1999 interfaith meeting where all the religions came together\n\n(1:22:18) they condemned the Christian fundamentalists who abuse speech and whose effort that converting others inside hatred and violence this is not an effort to convert anyone this is putting the truth out into the world what you do with it is your business you have freedom of choice that's the greatest gift that God has given you\n\n(1:22:38) this is truth I've ever told you to become anything no I'm just telling you this is what if the Bible says is what I say is what the Bible says is what I say choose that's all well present were in a chord on two key points of John Paul to was endorsed by consensus as the planets chief spiritual guide and over fear and\n\n(1:23:00) the religious fundamentalists who refuse to go along with the global a chimerical movement ought to be silenced they must be denounced as dangerous extremists full of hate I can't do anything about it but he wants to do that Jesus says go into all the world and preach the truth not a half-truth not like the wall of\n\n(1:23:21) separation between church and state this was erected by secular humanist god forbid and other enemies god forbid even more of religious freedom had to come down those opposing our views of you fascist dystonia Time magazine 1995 so the church wants to persecute in vain they worship Me teaching for doctrines\n\n(1:23:42) the commandments of men Matthew 15 9 if you love me keep my Commandments that's the message plain simple cut down to the chase choose Jesus Christ or choose the world that's your choice and the stores on the bride say come and let him that hear us say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him\n\n(1:24:05) take the water of life freely but your choice freedom of choice what a beautiful point choose the world or choose Jesus Christ choose obedience to the world choose obedience to Jesus Christ that's the choice is this coming soon and I believe is going to take his children to heaven and the Bible says\n\n(1:24:27) keep the commandments of God that you may have a right to enter not because the commandments save you because they tell you where your allegiance lie that's the bottom line choose Jesus day whom you

  "Title: \n 229_god_s_guiding_gift_total_onslaught_walter_veith_youtube.txt Key Topics: \n God's Communication,Prophecy Verification,True Prophet Criteria,False Prophets,Ellen G. White Guide: \n The source discusses the nature of true prophecy and how to identify a genuine prophet according to biblical criteria. It asserts that humanity is \"cut off\" from God due to sin, but God consistently reveals himself through prophets. The speaker highlights that true prophets must align with God's law and word, have predictions that come true (though sometimes conditionally), edify God's people, exalt Christ, speak with authority, and bear good fruit. The text then scrutinizes various historical and modern figures, like Madame Blavatsky and Joseph Smith, finding them to be false prophets based on these criteria. Finally, the speaker presents Ellen G. White as a figure who, despite personal challenges, fulfilled all the biblical tests of a true prophet, including exhibiting specific physical signs during visions and offering divinely inspired counsel, particularly in the realm of health, which was scientifically validated decades later.

[Music] [Music] oh [Music] well what's this satellite dish doing on the screen over here mankind has been probing space for quite a while in 1983 Newsweek reported the real hope is not just to intercept an alien weather report but to hear a message intended for Earth or for the Universe At Large and in uh 1983 US News and World Report\n (01:35) wrote if anyone is trying to get in touch with us we're ready to listen hello anybody out there very interesting the first cosmonaut that went up into space said there wasn't any God there we never saw him once well you can expect that why are we so cut off why are we so cut off the Bible tells us we are cut off\n (01:57) because of sin and they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden Genesis 3:8 so they hid themselves we hid ourselves even these may forget but I will not forget you behold I have\n (02:21) inscribed you on the palms of my hand Isaiah 49:15 and 16 if mankind wanted to they wouldn't have to go floating up there and say you anybody out there they can just read their Bible and look at history and they will know there is someone out there who cares enough Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret\n (02:46) unto his servants the prophets God has always spoken to this earth through His prophets and sometimes there was nobody left but His prophets and sometimes the world was so iniquitous they w't even even prophets speaking anymore second Peter 1:21 for the prophecy came not in Old Time by the will of man but holy men of God spoke as\n (03:09) they were moved by the Holy Ghost so the Bible clearly says that prophecy something that comes from God God communicating his will to man now we don't want that God actually wrote with his finger on Stone and said this is my will if you adhere to this we'll talk nope we don't want that we'll make our\n (03:32) own if there be a prophet amongst you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and I will speak unto him in a dream numbers 12:6 so it's very important that we understand how does God communicate through His prophets and how do we know whether someone is a prophet or a liar so we have to follow the biblical\n (03:52) criteria so if there's a prophet God will speak to him in a vision and in a dream so here comes the guy and says I've had a vision I've had a dream how do you know it's from God or whether it's from another source God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began acts 3: 21 man has really no\n (04:11) excuse shouldn't be cut off and of course the greatest message of all time came in Jesus Christ and the message was in John 12:32 and I if I am lifted up from Earth I will draw all to myself this is the greatest message of all time despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good 1\n (04:35) Thessalonians 5:20 to 21 today people despise prophecy because there's so much false prophecy how do you know which is true and which is false but the Bible says don't despise it prove it check it out if it's from God hold on to it if not get rid of it how do I know if it's from God or whether it's not from God\n (04:56) obviously God can't let us dangle there well I feel it's from God or whatever no no no you have to know whether it's from God 2 Chronicles 20:20 believe in the Lord God your God so shall you be established believe His prophets so shall you prosper important that we listen to the prophets because they warn\n (05:18) us of the hazards along the path that they may not speak out of harmony with God's word but they tell us where we are in the Stream of time Matthew 24:24 four there shall arise false christs false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that were possible they shall deceive the very elect big\n (05:38) problem so now how do I know which one is from God and which one is not so I mustn't despise prophecy I must prove it I must hold on to that which is good but I must watch out for false prophets that's what the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out\n (06:02) into the world this is a big job the Lord is not asking from us a small thing here this is a big job huge numbers of prophets out there which one is from God and which one is not triying check him out is it from God or is it not and thy child shalt be called the prophet of the highest and thou shalt go\n (06:24) before the face of the Lord to prepare his way so a prophet talks about the coming of the Lord prepare yourselves for the coming of the Lord give knowledge of Salvation a true Prophet will tell you how you can be saved unto his people by the remission of their sins so a true Prophet will not say there is nothing worse that can be\n (06:48) done than to talk of the Lost sinful condition of Man true prophets won't say that true true prophets will say we are all sinners and we need redemption in Jesus Christ through the tender mercy of our God whereby the day spring from on high has visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to\n (07:13) guide our feet in the way of Peace that's what a prophet should do but a preacher can do that too it doesn't have to be a prophet to do that anybody can do that as long as he sticks to the word of God but a prophet even more so a prophet must be in line with a Biblical teach teachings so how do we test the\n (07:31) prophets how do we know someone is a prophet of God or he's not a prophet of God well let's look at the criteria that the Bible gives a true prophet's message must be in harmony with the word of God and the law of God to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no\n (07:53) light in them the law is the first five books of the Bible the Torah which also contains the 10 Commandments and the testimony is everything that the prophets have said in harmony with the Torah Isaiah 8:20 the law is no more her prophets also find No Visions from the Lord Lamentations 2:9 God is Not\n (08:16) inconsistent you cannot be out of harmony with God's word and then expect God to speak to you so they have to keep the law of God they have to be in harmony with the law of God and they have to speak according to the Bible and be obedient to its precepts a true Prophet well that cuts out a lot of them\n (08:36) there goes Nostradamus gone all his Visions he got under drugs is that in harmony with the Bible don't think so two a true prophet's predictions must come true Deuteronomy 18:22 when a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord has not\n (08:58) spoken but the prophet has spoken presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid of him so every Prophet that tells you which horse is going to win the next race and he's happens to be right is from God yes or no no obviously this one must be qualified with what with all the others so everything must apply to the\n (09:20) prophet not just this one because the false prophet can also get things right and then the worst of it is that a true prophet can actually say something that doesn't come to pass and still be a true Prophet do we have examples in the Bible Jonah what did Jonah say nin is going to be destroyed 40 days and it's\n (09:44) all over was n destroyed no and Jonah knew it and he was totally freaked out because he knew that this might not come to pass why not because prophecy is conditional you see the prophet had told them you are sinners and God is going to destroy this place what did the ninevites do they repented in sackcloth\n (10:11) and Ashes and Jonah went and grumbled about this issue because he knew that now it could be construed that he was a false prophet see so careful how you deal with a true prophet's predictions must come true yes a prophet must be trustworthy what he says must come true but we mustn't forget the conditionalist\n (10:35) aspect and we mustn't forget all the other aspects associated with it as well so he must speak in accordance with the law he must also be truthful thirdly a true Prophet edifies God's people but he that prophesies speakes unto men to edification and exhalation and comfort he that prophesied edifies the\n (10:57) church you see God chooses prophets out of his church when Saul was called and became Paul thereafter he was sent to the church he was sent to the church to find out what he must do he didn't send Paul to the church to tell the church what they must do no the other way around so the prophets are in God's\n (11:24) Church a true Prophet exalts Christ as the Son of God who shall ever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God God dwelleth in him and he in God 1 John 4:15 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in all the scriptures the things concerning himself Luke 24:27 even Jesus was in\n (11:43) harmony with that so Jesus must be exalted another point point five a true Prophet speaks with authority for he taught them as one having Authority and not as one of the scribes Matthew 7:29 yes Elijah John the Baptist they had Authority they even have rebuked Kings number six a true Prophet will bear good fruit wherefore by their\n (12:12) fruits you shall know them Matthew 7 verse 20 interesting point and then there's something that's very interesting a true Prophet will exhibit definite physical signs when in Vision now let's read that the prophet's eyes are open during a vision he has said which heard the words of God which saw the vision of the almighty falling into\n (12:38) a trance the King James versions has in cursive writing which means it is included it's not in the original Greek text so falling but having his eyes open numbers 24:4 if you take the new King James it's a pretty good translation of the original text the utterance of him who hears the words of God who sees the\n (13:03) vision of the almighty Who falls down with eyes wide open so that's one of the physical attributes the prophet falls down and has the eyes wide open now if you take the NIV then you're in trouble the Oracle of one who hears the words of God who sees the VIS a vision of the almighty Who falls prostrate and whose\n (13:26) eyes are opened H that's not what the original Greek text says the Greek text says his eyes are open here it can be spiritualized way so again with the modern translations based on the west cotton H text you cannot use them for doctrinal purposes so let's stick to what the King James and the new King James says that's\n (13:54) one of the attributes of a prophet important that we stick to the detail the letter of the law second point of this physical attribute is a true Prophet falls down has no strength is then strengthened has no breath even whil speaking whilst Envision now that's a tough act to follow that's a very tough act to follow because only God has\n (14:20) life in him and can give life to his Prophet while he's speaking without breathing let's have a look at it Daniel 10 7 to8 that's why some very modern Bibles will remove the whole of Daniel chapter 10 they don't like it and I Daniel alone saw the vision there remained no strength in me Daniel's strength was taken away I kept\n (14:49) no strength when I heard the voice of his words then I was in a deep sleep on my face so where was he down nor is there breath left in me there's no breath in him then again one like a man in form came and Touched Me And He Made Me Stronger there's the sequence so the prophet has no strength Prophet\n (15:16) falls down Prophet has no breath in him and then someone raises him up and he becomes stronger how strong does one tend to become when God touches you with strength kind of strong how strong was Samson when God touched him well imagine this he caught a lion in midair and pulled him into two pieces that's pretty strong\n (15:42) can you imagine doing something like that or he went to the gates of the Philistine City and picked up the gates including the posts that were attached to it and ripped the whole Foundation out of the floor lifted it up ran up a hill and plonked it on top top of a hill wow that's pretty strong have you any\n (16:01) idea how huge those Gates were in the old days plus the foundations and everything that goes with it pretty strong okay just witer sake so that's what happens to this Prophet when he goes into Vision now Daniel 10:16 and behold one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips and I opened my mouth and I\n (16:23) spoke Old English spake and said unto him that stood before me oh my Lord Lord by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and I retain no strength for how can the servant of this my Lord talk with this my lord for as for me there remained no strength in me neither was there breath left in me\n (16:46) interesting Daniel 10:17 so he's speaking to God and he's saying to God how can I speak I have no breath is this what is happening here okay Now new King James says Daniel 10:17 as for me no strength remains in me now nor is any breath left in me when you go to the NIV you're in trouble if you go to\n (17:12) the RSV you're in trouble my strength is gone and I can hardly breathe that's not what the original says that is a lie that's a blatant lie I wonder why they put the blatant lie there are they trying to cover something up cuz their prophets fall with eyes closed and they breathe while they are in vision is that\n (17:31) a possibility you think that's a possibility I think that's a possibility so what's the summary the summary is the prophet falls down weak is that biblical second he raised up and strengthened by God is that biblical third his eyes are wide open during a vision is that biblical fourth he does not breathe\n (17:54) during a vision but can speak is that biblical that's what the Bible says now it sounds highly improbable but that's what the Bible says plus all the other points that we mentioned all of it must be in harmony but this one as you will imagine is one that's a tough act to follow would you agree that's a tough\n (18:15) act to follow wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men Ephesians 4:8 so God gave all the gifts that are needed into the church some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors some teachers 411 everybody gets GI for the perfecting of the Saints\n (18:37) that's what the gifts are there for for the ministry taking the message to the outside world the edifying of the body of Christ Ephesians 4:12 so these gifts these spiritual gifts are to build up the church and to empower them to take the message to A Dying World that's what they're for so God does doesn't give\n (18:58) these gifts to those outside to come and edify his church no his church gets the gifts to go and edify those outside never the other way round till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that's the bottom line and\n (19:19) through this gift God brings us into Unity as to what is truth and what is not truth now what if we choose to reject the prophet of God what happens then well the people of old did it what did they do to Isaiah did they like his message no so they took him and they soord him in half it's not a nice thing\n (19:40) to do to a prophet is it did they like the message of Jeremiah no so they lowered him into a system they beat him up they put him into uh all kinds of yolks and they really mistreated him terribly well they didn't like the messages of the prophets in the past do you think they like the messages of the prophets later on maybe\n (20:05) you think things will change or maybe get worse who knows and God has said some in the church first apostles then prophets then teachers then Miracles Gifts of healing helps governments Deliverance tongues all kinds of gifts 1 Corinthians 12:28 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and throw and carried\n (20:24) about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight to deceive Ephesians 4:14 and then the early church had wonderful prophets there were the most of the apostles were prophets in their own right there were many other prophets as we will see and then slowly the\n (20:45) church changed its rules and towards the 2 Century towards the end there was a new form the disciples retired then the man of sin arose the horns were eyes like the of a man speaking blasphemies great things heathenism paganism came back into the church shall wear out the Saints of the most high think to change\n (21:09) times and laws now if God's law no longer exists what did the Bible say the prophets will no longer find Visions from the Lord remember that Proverbs 29:18 for there is where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he the law is no more her prophets also find No Visions from the Lord\n (21:32) Lamentations 2:9 so prophecies seemed to dry up on this planet seemed to dry up and then God called the Reformation but they didn't re discover the law they didn't come back into harmony with everything God LED them by their Spirit you can be led by the spirit but that doesn't make you a prophet so they preached great things\n (21:56) and at the end of time it shall come to pass after it that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your young men shall see Vision the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the Commandments of God and have the\n (22:10) testimony of Jesus Christ at the end of time people will be empowered by the spirit so some will dream things to dream something by itself doesn't necessarily make you a prophet some will have visions that's interesting and uh some will be called to the prophetic Ministry Revelation 12:17 so what is this testimony of Jesus\n (22:35) remember we read it and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said to me see that thou doth not I'm a fellow servant of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy Revelation 19:10 so the final Church must have the prophetic gift again coming behind in no gift\n (22:58) as they wait for the coming of the Lord so the Bible predicts that the gift of Prophecy will be restored to God's Church in the last days well did it happen or not 1 Corinthians 1: 16:7 even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that you come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus\n (23:21) Christ at the end of time when the law will be restored when the Great biblical truths come to the for then the gift of Prophecy will be restored so God's last day Church would keep his Commandments and have the gift of Prophecy this is a tough tough situation the sun shall be turned to Darkness do you remember before the\n (23:45) great coming of the day of the Lord Joel and the stars of Heaven fell untimely figs we dealt with that when we dealt with this issue of Revelation chap 10 William Miller Started preaching about about prophecy great things were again discovered and at the same time as William Miller starts preaching proph\n (24:05) prophecy again here arise a whole host of prophets wherever you look there are prophets now which one is from God and which one is not from God that's an interesting question Madame blavatsky she says Lucifer is the logos the serpent the savior Satan is the only God of this planet does she sound like a\n (24:31) true Prophet to you I think she doesn't sound like a true Prophet to me because the very first biblical criteria she stumbles and falls and is found wanting because that one says to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word they have no light in them and then it also says that a true Prophet will\n (24:55) uplift Jesus Christ and will acknowledge Him as the true Son of God this one says Lucifer is the Son of God sorry Madame blavatsky but you must be a false prophet what about Johanna southcot mother of Christ 1750 to 1840 she said well she was expecting Jesus Christ she was pregnant with him so convinced with her\n (25:20) were her followers that upon her death they had an autop autopsy done to find if Jesus wasn't perhaps alive in her store or the Messiah well there was nothing there so strange did her prophecy come true no what about Russell he claimed that he had prophetic visions and what did he do he demoted Jesus\n (25:46) Christ so must be false prophet what about Joseph Smith contradicted the Bible left right and Center got messages from an angel Moroni that told him that he was the new priest and that uh the true God was not the one that he claimed to be no no no the Mormons claimed the devil told the truth in Eden Jehovah was the liar sorry\n (26:15) Joseph Smith sorry Brigham Young you must be false prophets you're not speaking according to the law neither are you speaking according to the testimony and who your angel Moroni is I don't know Mormon Temple Salt Lake City what about Nostradamus did he speak things that came true well you can interpret them\n (26:36) after the fact that it might be so because you know his verses sort of seem to imply that well if uh taking drugs is a way to get prophetic insights then great did he live the life bear good fruits I doubted all these Millennial prophets what about the Gnostic prophets they all thought that Jesus was not the\n (26:57) Son of God and that there was another deity what about Edgar casee the great healer and Prophet well he also taught that we were basically God what about Pope Pas he said all authority is vested in him he also had visions and he said that the Roman Catholic Church would anchor The Gospel Ship very interesting but it wasn't\n (27:21) according to the law neither according to the testimony in fact they did exactly the opposite what about our friend well I wouldn't like to call him a friend aliser Crowley and his allseeing eye this great prophet and Magician of the of this New Age Era the great uh spokesman for the great rock bands of\n (27:42) the world well one of the most wow outspoken critics of the Bible that the world has ever said seen he wanted to be kissed by the wanting kisses of Babylon interesting quotes Maria Dei Christos Jim Jones all of these claimed to be Messiah they turned out to be anything but Messias so here in the 1840s here\n (28:08) were all these false prophets and there was this group of Advent Believers and a young man by the name of William Foy he received visions and then he refused to speak about these Visions because he said he was black and therefore people wouldn't accept him because of the Prejudice of the age then a man by the\n (28:30) name of Hazen fos he had visions and he said no the consequences are too tough I'm not going to repeat this to anyone so he kept it to himself so here were young men having visions but they refused to go and speak and then a young woman by the name of Ellen G Harmon who later married and became Ellen G white\n (28:51) born in 1827 died in 1915 California she received visions she was a young girl and uh after I had the vision and God gave me light he bade me deliver it but I shrank from it I was young and I thought they would not receive it from me that's what she said but then one day she decided she would give statements\n (29:13) made by Hazen fos now this was the man who previously had had a vision he refused to give it then one day he decided to try and give it and he couldn't remember what he had seen and then he attended a meeting where this young Ellen Harman was speaking about what she s and he said to her the lord gave me a message to Bear to his people\n (29:32) and I refused after being told the consequences I heard you talk last night and I believe the Visions are taken from me and given to you do not refuse to obey God for it will be at the Peril of your soul I am a lost man you are chosen of God be faithful in doing your work and the crown I might have had you will\n (29:50) receive well that's an interesting story so here is a young girl now with a very interesting history when she was but a young girl uh classmate threw a stone at her and hit her on the head and she became debilitated and her front here above the nose was crushed in and she could not attend more than three years of\n (30:16) schooling so this young girl at the age of 12 was debilitated here's a photograph that's of her where you can see the one eye is slightly higher than the other he was pretty badly injured but of course they in those days they didn't have the surgery techniques that they have today and this is the young\n (30:37) girl that started following Miller's message together with many others and then received these uh visions and one of them concerned the sanctuary and what it stands for very fascinating Vision about Christ being the minister of a sanctuary in heaven which is is to be found in the book of of Hebrews now remember that uh the dragon\n (31:04) was going to be wroth with the remnant that keeps the Commandments and would have the testimony of Jesus he was going to be angry so the final battle the woman in white and the dragon and his synagogue well they were going to clash the testimony of Jesus the spirit of Prophecy so that you become behind in no\n (31:27) gift as you wait for the coming of the Lord and remember second Peter which says we have a more sure word of Prophecy where unto you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of\n (31:47) scripture is of any private interpretation for no prophecy ever came by the will of man but men spake from God being moved by the Holy Spirit so the question is is this from God or is it from the devil test the prophets the Bible says not all prophets contributed to the scriptures one argument would be but did\n (32:10) this person contribute anything to the scriptures answer is no God used both men and women as a prophet because this was a female examples in the Old Testament Nathan and Gad 2 Samuel and 1 Samuel they didn't contribute to the script scriptures prophetesses included Miriam Exodus 15:20 holda the prophetes 2 Kings\n (32:33) 22:14 and Deborah judges 44 examples in the New Testament of prophets and prophetesses that didn't take up weren't taken up in the cannon include Simeon Anna agabus Barnabas Philip's four daughters these were all prophets in the Bible that didn't contribute to the Bible so the vital question did she fulfill the biblical\n (32:57) criteria it's a very interesting question that I would like to know well manuscripts 88 1900 the Lord has said write out the things which I shall give you and I commenced when I was very young to do this work my hand that was feeble and trembling because of infirmities became steady as soon as I took the pen in my hand and since those\n (33:20) first writings I've been able to write she was only 17 years old had only three years of schooling and started to write so one argument that people had can God use someone that is so physically weak and only has three years of schooling well yes in fact God can use a donkey didn't he use a donkey yes he\n (33:49) used a donkey and what happens if you refuse to listen to the donkey well then you could just die you see so if you could use a donkey then surely you could use someone with three years of education that's better than a donkey I don't recall donkey's going to school do you so anyway she says as soon\n (34:09) as I took a pen in my hand and since those first writings I've been able to write so now let's look at the criteria did she exalt the word of God and the law of God the Bible what did she write selected messages volume two the holy scriptures are to be accepted as an authorative INF able revelation of his\n (34:28) will they are to be the standard of character the revealer of Doctrine and the test of experience Bible cling to your Bible as it reads and stop your criticism in regard to its validity and obey the word of God and not one of you will be lost selected messages volume 1 page 18 and now what is supposed to be the Creed selected\n (34:50) messages volume one page 416 the Bible and the Bible alone is to be our Creed the sole Bond of Union God's word is infallible lift up the banner on which is inscribed the Bible our rule of faith and discipline question if you wrote so much and the Bible is to be our only Creed then why bother to write so much isn't\n (35:15) the Bible enough well aren't the people confusing the Bible today everywhere left right and Center so she cannot add anything she cannot subtract anything she can just write put light upon what there is already present that's all that she could do because she clearly says the Bible and the Bible alone is to be\n (35:36) our Creed so if somebody comes and says aha but here it says that you must do this that and the other and say where you get that from say show to me in the Bible if it's not there goodbye Five testimonies the Lord designs to warn you to reprove to counsel through the testimony is given and to impress your minds with the\n (35:54) importance of the truth of his word so that's what it's for the written testimonies are not to give new light but to impress vividly upon the heart the truths of inspiration already revealed that's what the prophets did all along man's duty to God and to his fellow man has been distinctly specified in God's word yet but few of you are\n (36:15) obedient to the light given additional truth is not brought out but God has through the testimony simplified the great truths already given and in his own chosen way brought them before the people to awaken and impress the mind with them that all may be left without excuse so here is something that seems\n (36:34) to be in law in harmony with the law and the Bible F 15 manuscripts released then present them the prophecies show them the Purity and binding claims of the law of God not one jut or title of this law is to lose its Force but hold its binding claims upon every soul to the end of time is that in harmony with the law and the and the\n (36:55) testimony yeah cannot men see that belittle the law of God is to dishonor Christ why did he come to this world to suffer and die if the law is not binding upon human beings that makes sense called to expose the man of sin in the very time in which we live the Lord has called his people and has given them a message to bear has called\n (37:19) them to expose the wickedness of the man of sin who has made the Sunday Lord distinctive power who has thought to change time and laws and to oppress the people of God who stand firmly to honor him by keeping the only true Sabbath the Sabbath of creation as holy unto the Lord that definitely in harmony with the\n (37:38) scriptures maybe not in harmony with the feelings of many organizations in the world but it's biblical did their predictions come true well that's an interesting point San Francisco earthquake April 18 1906 she predicted it yes it came true she predicted great turmoil and Wars the Lord declares through the prophet Isaiah\n (38:02) associate yourselves oh you people and you shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye far countries guard yourselves and you shall be broken in pieces this is a quote direct from isah 89:3 guard yourselves and you'll be broken in pieces take counsel together and shall come to not speak the word and\n (38:20) it shall not stand for God is with us for the Lord spoke thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that I should not walk in the of this people saying A Confederacy to all them to whom the people shall say A Confederacy neither fear ye Their Fear nor be afraid sanctify the Lord of hosts himself and\n (38:37) let him be your fear and let him be your dread now here's an interesting scripture what does it mean you're can to have a thousand interpretations here's an interesting one she writes there are those who question whether it is right for Christians to belong to Freemasons and other secret societies let all such consider the scriptures\n (38:57) just quoted if we are Christians at all we must be Christians everywhere and must consider and heed the counsel given to make us Christians according to the standard of God's word oh interesting statement this terrible picture drawn by John the Revelation shows how completely the powers of Earth will give themselves\n (39:18) over to evil and should show those who have received the truth how dangerous it is to link up with secret societies or to join themselves in any way to those who do not keep God's Commandments fascinating stuff 14 manuscript release by a variety of images the Lord Jesus presented to John the wicked character\n (39:36) and the seductive influence of those who have been distinguished for their persecution of God's people this starts to make Revelation come alive there's nothing new here it stands in the Book of Revelation God's presentation of the detestable works of the inhabitants of the ruling powers of the world will bind\n (39:55) themselves into to secret societies confederacies not honoring the law of God keep clear of these evils more and more false religionists of the world manifest their evil doings there are but two parties those who keep the Commandments of God and those who war against God's law very interesting and so she continues here with a host of\n (40:19) quotes dealing with this very Issue four manuscripts release is fascinating in the World gigantic monopolies will be formed now remember this is written 150 years ago do we find today gigantic monopolies being formed absolutely everywhere men will bind themselves together in unions that will wrap them\n (40:44) in the folds of the enemy a few men will combine to grasp all the means to be obtained in a certain line of business is that happening today do we have mega stores Mega Banks Mega this Mega that yes or no absolutely trade unions will be formed will be formed take note and those who refuse to join these unions\n (41:05) will be marked men is that happening today yes or no absolutely I've stood on the other side of trade unions gone berserk it's scary let me tell you it's scary the trade unions will be one of the agencies that will bring about upon this Earth a time of trouble such has not been since the world began can you\n (41:26) imagine the turmoil that happens when labor unrest comes to a country unbelievable I can tell you stories about this unbelievable 150 years ahead of time what does the world teach it's a human right to have all of these it's a human right in the revelation of his righteous judgments God will break up\n (41:45) all these associations and the Judgment shall sit the books will be opened and the UN christlikeness of the whole Confederacy will be plain to other they serve God Gods as useless to save as the gods of the Hindus interesting the message we bear must be as direct as the message of John he rebuke Kings for their\n (42:07) iniquity fascinating stuff we do not go deep enough in our search for truth Every Soul who believes present truth will be brought where he will be required to give a reason for the hope that is in him the people of God will be called upon to stand before Kings princes rulers great men of the earth and they must know that they do know\n (42:29) what is truth they must be converted men and women God can teach you more in one moment by his holy spirit than you could learn from the Great Men of the Earth the universe is looking upon the controversy that is going on upon the Earth it's very Christ centered it's Bible centered and this is happening all\n (42:49) over the world those who stand under the bloodstained banner of Prince Emmanuel cannot be United with Freemasons or secret organizations either you are with Christ or you are against him at an infinite cost God has provided for every man an opportunity to know that which will make him wise unto salvation how eagerly do\n (43:12) angels look to see what will Avail himself of this opportunity when a message is presented to God's people they should not rise up in opposition to it they should go to the Bible comparing it with the law and the testimony and if it does not bear this test it is not true God wants our minds to expand he\n (43:32) desires to put his grace upon us we may have a feast of good things every day for God can open a whole Treasure of Heaven to us does it sound biblical I think it does the judgments of Earth are abroad floods tempests wroth will be poured out Etc interesting stations Nation will be on the side of the rebel nation\n (43:56) and then you have these great events of our time the Twin Towers 1904 in a manuscript she writes when I was last in New York I was in the night season called upon to behold buildings Rising story after Story towards heaven that's before New York had high-rise buildings these buildings were warranted\n (44:20) to be fireproof and they were erected to glorify the owners higher and still higher these buildings Rose and in them the most costly material was used the scene that next passed was in the alarm of fire men looked at lofty and supposedly fireproof buildings and said they are perfectly safe but these\n (44:38) buildings were consumed as if made of pitch the fire engines could nothing do nothing to stay the destruction she says I awoke and from my window I saw a terrible configration Great Balls of Fire were falling upon houses and from these balls fiery arrows were flying in every direction if you watch television\n (44:59) you will have seen this Vision in detail it was impossible to check the fires many places was being destroyed the terror of the people was Indescribable while appearing to the children of men as a great physician to heal their maladies maladies he will bring disease and disaster and then she goes on to explain and she uses the take\n (45:25) the Earth more mourneth and fadeth away the hay people do languish the Earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinances broken the Everlasting Covenant Isaiah 24:4 and5 she used the Bible for every single thing to the law and to the testimony if\n (45:46) they keep not according to this word they have no light in them now there's one other thing that is very interesting that Ellen White saw and that is the great Health Vision this is an amazing Vision that really fascinated me now as a scientist and as a physiologist this was something that stunted me in 1864 she wrote tobacco is\n (46:13) a poison of the most deceitful and malignant kind having an exciting and then a paralyzing influence upon the nerves of the body it is all the more dangerous because its effect upon the system are so slow and at first scarcely perceivable multitudes have fallen victim to its poisonous influence well\n (46:31) that's no big deal everybody knows cigarettes are bad for you but this was written in 1864 when the medical world was teaching that this was the new cure to all lung ailments and when the medical world was saying smoke and this will help you and it'll get rid of all your problems all your maladies Here Comes one little\n (46:53) woman and writes exactly the opposite to what the world was teaching it was not until 1957 that a committee of scientists appointed by the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association concluded that smoking was a causative factor in lung cancer so she is way ahead of her time no doubt what did she\n (47:13) write about tea and coffee what did she write about the lifestyles that people have in the world today what did you write about foods high in cholesterol and all of these things today we have fear fear in the food toxins we have entis diseases we have diseases amongst animals as you cannot imagine I made this part of my research\n (47:36) at the University and I received awards for the research that we were doing and I even received from um from London I received an award to do research in this particular field from the Royal Society of London I was one of only five scientists to receive this we did so many tests on transfer of diseases from\n (48:00) animals to man and amazing things that we discovered Health alert over chickens deadly eggs says their spegel Ellen White wrote in 1901 soon butter will never be recommended has it come to pass absolutely and after a Time milk will be entirely discarded for disease in animals is increasing in proportion to\n (48:24) the increase of wickedness among men the time will come when there will be no safety in using eggs milk cream or butter deadly eggs incredible she saw a deterioration in the animal world flesh was never the best food but it is now doubly objectionable since disease in animals is so rapidly increasing and she talks\n (48:45) about milk that it should be thoroughly sterilized with this precaution there's less danger of Contracting disease way ahead of a Time Butter is less harmful when eaten on cold bread then when used in cooking now hold on how did she know that you see how could she know that when butter is heated it forms three\n (49:08) radicals which are carcinogenic number one and which caus clogging of the arteries nobody knew that in her day this was way ahead of time so very simple you take butter and you do the tests and you find out what happens and you'll see this is correct this is correct but as a rule it is better to dispense\n (49:27) with it all together way ahead of a Time cheese is still more objectional it's holy unfit for food wow you say that loud I have a whole lecture on this that I give in scientific circles and there's no two ways about this one it's one of the most allergenic Foods in the world asthma would probably disappear\n (49:48) osteoporosis would probably disappear from the face of the Earth if people would take heed to these these suggestions ches should never be introduced into the stomach which countries have the highest rate of osteoporosis in the world the Netherlands Norway all the dairy countries they have the highest\n (50:06) rate of osteoporosis why because they're eating the food with the highest acid forming content in the world which has to be neutralized by calcium released from the bone and causes osteoporosis we could save ourselves a lot of trouble here let the diet reform be Progressive that people be taught how to prepare\n (50:25) food without the use of milk or butter let them that the time will soon come when there will be no safety in using eggs milk cream or butter because disease and animals is increasing increasing in proportion to the wickedness of men very interesting The Killers all around that's what science is saying in all parts of the world\n (50:43) provision will be made to supply the place of milk and eggs has it happened yes today you get rice milk soy milk oat milk you name it nut milk and the Lord will let us know when the time time comes to give up these art he desires all to feel that we have a gracious heavenly father who will instruct them\n (51:01) in all things and the Lord will give dietetic Art and skill to his people in all parts of the world teaching them how to use for the sustenance of Life the products of the earth wonderful regard now in regard to Milk and Sugar I know of persons who have become frightened of Health reform and said would have nothing to do with it because\n (51:20) it is spoken against the free use of these things changes should be made with great care we should move cautiously and wisely there's no fanaticism here we want to take the course that will recommend itself to the intelligent men and women of the land large quantities of milk and sugar eaten together are\n (51:38) injurious they impart impurities to the system sugar clogs the system it hinders the working of the living machine this must be rubbish right unless you go and test it and what's the problem with milk and sugar what's the problem there with well a sign scientist came to my university and he had a lecture to give to the physiology\n (51:59) Department I'm in a to was totally secular University and he said I did research on the combination of milk and sugar for a chocolate company because that's what chocolate is the combination of milk and sugar right and he said what I found is so hair raising I'll never be funded Again by a chocolate\n (52:18) company number one if I took the milk by itself the triglycerides went up the cholesterol went up and the sugar went up and the but and came down after 3 hours if I take the Sugar by itself I was surprised to see the triglycerides go up I saw the cholesterol levels go up and the sugar go up and then end in\n (52:35) hypoglycemia that was bad but when I combined them it was a total nightmare because not only did they rise more than double but it stayed like that for 10 hours so the best recipe for dying in your sleep is to take a milk and sugar combination just before you go to sleep because it'll slow down your blood sugar\n (52:56) clogs the system to such an extent that you could die and most people actually die in their sleep of heart attacks and that's the favorite drink before you go to sleep you take milk and sugar because it switches off the brain and then you go to sleep well she said that 150 years ago isn't that surprising what wonderful things someone\n (53:18) may attempt to explain how she said all these things how did she quote from the current literature well how would you know what to quote Ministry of healing Temperance councils on diets and food there is a host of stuff in there did she edify the church did she do that I said that I did not claim to be a prophetes I have not\n (53:41) stood before the people claiming this title though May many called me thus I've been instructed to say I'm God's messenger sent to Bear a message of reproof so some said okay she says she's not a prophetess to claim to be a prophetess is something I have never done if others call me by that name I have no controversy with them so they\n (54:00) put pressure on her are you a prophet are you not a prophet she says you know there are so many false prophets out why should I say I'm a prophet I'm a prophet she was humble about it I cannot call myself other than a messenger sent to Bear a message from the Lord to his people and to take up of work in any line that he points\n (54:17) out well during the discourse I said that I did not claim to be a propheus some were surprised at this statement and as much as being said in regard to it I will make an explanation others have called me a prophetess but I have never assumed this title I have not felt that it was my duty to thus designate\n (54:37) myself those who boldly assume that they are prophets in this day are often a reproach to the cause of Christ my work includes much more than this name signifies I regard myself as a messenger entrusted by the Lord with messages for his people I am now instructed that I am not to be hindered in my work by those who\n (54:58) engage in suppositions regarding its nature whose minds are struggling with so many issues my commission Embraces the work of a prophet but it does not end there so she said she was a prophet she said she was a prophet did she exalt Christ as the Son of God there's a beautiful statement in the review and Herald the world's Redeemer\n (55:20) was treated as we deserve to be treated in order that we might be treated as he deserved to be treated he came to our world and took our sins upon his Divine soul that we might receive his imputed righteousness he was condemned for our sins in which he had no share that we might be justified by his righteousness\n (55:40) in which we had no share I wish I had only three years of education and could write like that the Desire of Ages probably one of the greatest books ever written no I'll qualify that I believe it is the greatest book ever written on the life of Jesus Christ anybody who reads that will be stunned her writings only one\n (56:05) other woman compares and that woman's name is Alice a Bailey she exalts Lucifer and says I have no other task but to prepare the world for the coming of the coming one who is Lucifer and this one over here says no other life ask but to prepare the way for the coming of Jesus Christ the one in the Bible to the law to the\n (56:31) testimony Christ subject lessons The Desire of Ages steps to Christ thoughts from the Mount of blessing wow there are so many books dealing with Jesus Christ it's unbelievable all painfully written by hand manuscript after manuscript did you speak with authority I instructed to say that those who Endeavor to tear down the\n (56:52) foundations of what made a Seventh Day Adventist we are God God's commandment keeping people for the past 50 years every phase of heresy has been brought to bear upon us to belcloud our mind regarding the teachings of the word he calls upon us to hold firmly with a grip of Faith to the fundamental principles\n (57:08) that are based on unquestionable Authority did she bear good fruit well wherever she went today there are hospitals there are teaching institutions everywhere the work has been built up this was where she lived when she died Elms Haven and uh simple table that's where she wrote most of her Visions this is\n (57:34) one of her great great granddaughters glad it's cuck and uh she still talks about some of the things that she remembers did she exhibit the physical signs now here is the Crux of the matter you see the prophet has to fulfill all the signs does she qualify let me summarize them for you once again number one the prophet falls\n (57:58) down weak we got this from the Bible and the Bible alone remember number two raised up and strengthened by God number three eyes open during a vision number four does not breathe during a vision but can speak tough act to follow now these were T tent meetings now normally prophets going to Vision in\n (58:21) some secluded little room with a bunch of people around them or convinced or whatever not this one Ellen White went into Visions publicly with thousands of people and Skeptics all around and publicly in front of all those people God gave her Visions later on in life when this was no longer necessary most of her Visions were in\n (58:49) dreams but when she started off the Visions were public visions and what happened at those visions well here are the writings in passing into Vision she gets three en raptured shots of Glory which Echo and re-echo then for about four or five seconds she seems to drop down like a person in a swoon or one having lost his\n (59:10) strength she then seems to be instantly filled with superhuman strength sometimes rising at once to her feet walking about the room or in the tent meeting or in the Gathering or wherever she was her eyes are always open but she does not wink her hand is raised and she looks upward not with a vacant stare but with a pleasant\n (59:33) expression eyewitness account June 12 1868 she walked back and forth and talked to us and as she walked she fell right down Prophet falls down she fell down gently there was no catcher behind her she went down as an angel's hands was under her sister white lay perfectly quiet and unconscious her eyes were open\n (59:53) with a pleasant expression on her face Faith nothing unnatural and unusual brother white there was a husband said to these large men take her hands apart there she was lying take her hands apart you have two hands to her one just pull her hands apart he was this frail little girl lying there so they tried they\n (1:00:10) pulled and pulled till some of us got anxious that they would hurt her this a public Vision brother white said don't be anxious She is safe in God's keeping you can pull until you are perfectly satisfied they said we are satisfied now we don't need to pull anymore he said take up one finger at a time this was\n (1:00:31) impossible they could not so much as move a finger it seemed like a block of granite brother white said to these men now hold her when she got up and she started speaking and moving her hands and speaking about whatever she saw I think they thought they could they grasp her by the wrist but they could not\n (1:00:47) the motion so these big men when she went like this they went along whether they liked it or not it looked like any child could hold her but she went on just the same now we must see if her eyelids were closed there was a large rust that's the lamp close by removed the shave put the light right in front of her eyes we\n (1:01:07) thought she would move her eyes to protect them she didn't she was perfectly unconscious the eyelids did not close brother white said we must see if there's any breath in her body there didn't seem to be any everything looked all right only there was no breath brother white said now we will send out\n (1:01:23) and get a mirror and we will tested so someone went to the next door and got a mirror and was held close to her face but no moisture gathered so there was no breathing all right then she went into Vision again and medical doctors Skeptics came to test two Physicians came in an old man and a young man\n (1:01:42) brother white was anxious that they should examine sister white closely which they did a looking gasp was brought one of them held it to over her mouth while she talked but very soon they gave this up and said she doesn't breathe they then closely examined her sides as she spoke to find some evidence of deep\n (1:02:01) breathing but they did not find it as they closed this part of the examination she arose to her feet still in Vision holding a Bible high up turning from page to passage quoting correctly although the eyes were looking upward and away from the Bible so she held the Bible up like this and paged like this\n (1:02:18) quoting from the Bible so somebody must have gotten up on a chair and checked it out and yes it was right and here this little girl was holding this huge Family Bible for hours on end while she was speaking and not breathing after Mrs White Rose to her feet as they have stated quoting the texts of scripture Dr Fleming called for\n (1:02:40) a lighted candle he held this candle as near to her lips as possible without burning and in direct line with her breath in case she breathed there was not the slightest flicker of the Blaze the doctor then said with emphasis that settles it forever there's no breath in her body either this is true or it's not true\n (1:02:57) these are Public public meetings the gift of Prophecy 1844 to 1915 either it is from God or it is not from God well today this Prophet sleeps this Prophet is no longer there but the writings linger she showed no spiritual Pride she sought no filthy lucer she Liv the life and did the work of a worthy prophetes\n (1:03:26) the most admirable of the American succession this is the New York independent August 23 1925 a totally independent source so now we have this Choice do you know what happened to me when I began to discover the truths of the Bible I said the Bible and the Bible alone I don't need this stuff I don't need this give me the Bible it\n (1:03:52) does everything for me I don't need anything else and then I got a phone call from a colleague of mine who had heard that I had become an Adventist and first he gave me Blazers for having become an Adventist and then he went to town on this woman I'd never read a word of hers I'd become an Adventist on the Bible and\n (1:04:14) the Bible alone nothing to do with the spirit of Prophecy and then he went to town and he called her the most terrible things that you can imagine he was so irate about this and the words that came out of his mouth I don't even want to repeat them and when he put the phone down I thought to myself now who is this\n (1:04:38) that someone should be so angry about these writings so I went and found them and started reading and the more I read and I couldn't read without my Bible next to me and my Bible started coming alive and for the first time I understood Jesus Christ and what he meant for me and I could have found it in the\n (1:05:04) Bible but I couldn't find it in that depth that I found it explained in the spirit of Prophecy the Bible became alive she didn't take me away from the Bible she led me to the Bible and so this Prophet that is demeaned in the world that is detested in the world if anybody hears even the name they will say the\n (1:05:31) most horrendous things about this Prophet a liar a plagiarist or this or that and the other you name it test the prophets Now isn't it so that when the prophet is loved and revered in the world that there's probably a problem with it why is Alice a Bailey honored at the level of the United Nations why are\n (1:05:56) her writings the basis of the world Core Curriculum why does this prophetes influence the world so much and this one is so despised interesting question so my answer to you is if it is from God then accept it and read it and if you find that it takes you away from the Bible throw it aside and read the Bible\n (1:06:27) and the Bible alone because after all she does say we have no other Creed except the Bible so the proof of the pudding is in the eating but every single biblical Criterium is fulfilled by her and I know of no other prophet of modern times that qualifies not [Music] one [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music]\n (1:07:52) oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:230_earth_s_final_warning_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nEarth's Final Warning,144,000 Redeemed,Everlasting Gospel,Babylon's Fall,Three Angels' Messages\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, \"Earth's Final Warning,\" centers on Revelation Chapter 14's three angels' messages as a crucial, ultimate divine communication to humanity. The speaker emphasizes that these messages call for a return to true worship of God as Creator and Redeemer, rather than adhering to human-made systems or false doctrines. A significant theme is the importance of obedience to God's commandments, especially the Sabbath, as an act of acknowledging divine authority and receiving imputed righteousness, contrasting this with the \"Babylonian\" system of false worship and spiritualism that will ultimately be rejected. Ultimately, the source frames this as a choice between following Christ and His laws, or succumbing to deceptive worldly systems, with eternal consequences.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 230 - Earth's Final Warning _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoYbSL1wRFs\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you well this lecture is titled earth final warning because that's basically what it is it is chapter 14 in the book of Revelation which tells us what the final message to a world gone berserk is going to be Revelation chapter 14 and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion\n\n(01:32) and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand having his father's name written in their forest now we've discussed 144,000 already so I'm not going to go into detail as far as they are concerned but they have the character of God impressed in their mind the father's name written in their forests and I heard a voice from heaven\n\n(01:59) as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and I heard the voice of Harper's harping with their hearts and they fun if it were a new song before the throne the new song is a song of redemption it is a song of delivery it's something that you cannot understand unless you've had a\n\n(02:21) conversion experience or a delivery experience so this will be a song sung with gusto which will be essential or part of the redeemed and before the four beasts and the elders and we've discussed them already as well the covering cherubs and the twenty-four elders and no man could learn that song but 144,000 which were redeemed from the\n\n(02:52) earth obviously you cannot live someone else's experience you cannot give someone else something which you have not experienced yourself and so it is with the ten virgins at the end there were ten virgins at the end each one of them was asleep all of them had oil all of them had a measure of the Holy Spirit and then when the bride\n\n(03:23) group came they all woke up but only half of them had enough oil to make it to the wedding piece and the others didn't have enough oil and so they asked those who had to give some of the oil and they said that we cannot give you any of our oil and some people say that selfishness why didn't they give them\n\n(03:47) some of the oil I mean what's the big deal well you cannot share an experience you cannot say well here's a part of my experience let me pull that pull that into your into your lamp you'll have to have had it yourself if you'll have to have that experience of Jesus Christ yourself so everyone needs oil everyone\n\n(04:08) needs this experience and only if you've had the experience can you sing the song the only way to sing this song you need the experience okay these are they which were not defiled with women it's always makes me sad this statement because I had a colleague one who left his wife because of that statement in the Bible\n\n(04:34) can you believe it how people think literally left his wife because of that statement in the Bible and I said to him you know I think you have our own understanding about what a woman is in the Bible this has nothing to do with physical contact between a man and a woman this is something that deals with\n\n(04:56) false worship these are they who have not defiled themselves with a phosphate systems of worship now he was convinced it was not defiling himself literally with women so I've seen one more question I said you've been married all these years isn't it a little bit late if that is what you believe that cause I\n\n(05:20) know is still is away from his wife but anyway that's not what it means obvious it means these are they which have not defiled themselves with the prostate for they are virgins they are with Christ these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from amongst men being the\n\n(05:47) firstfruits unto God and to the land and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of God why because they have perfect righteousness actually they have but it's not there as its imputed and imparted righteousness so you know none of us are virgins none of us are virgins\n\n(06:14) but in Christ we are because in him forgiveness is so total that you have no sin and you are as though you have never sinned and therefore virgins in his eyes what a wonderful blessing that is and no guile was found in their mouth when I think about myself Wow can i qualify I had a mind like a sewer all my life in\n\n(06:42) their mouth was found no guile can God just clean it up like that yes you can yes you can for they are without fault before the throne why because he is a spotless lamb and stands in my stead as I chapter 48 here yeezus o house of Jacob which are called by the name of Israel Israel those who have wrestled\n\n(07:09) with God and have overcome who said I will not let you go list you bless me don't give up just hang in there and then by faith except that it is so and I'll come forth out of the waters of Judah which swear by the name of the Lord and make mention of the God of Israel but not intrusive no in righteousness for they call themselves\n\n(07:37) of a holy city and stay themselves upon the God of Israel the Lord of Hosts is his name I have declared the form of thing the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and I showed them and they did them suddenly and I did them suddenly and they came to pass so there are some people who declare that they are the\n\n(07:55) Lords that are the Lords there are the Lords but in actual fact they're relying on a system rather than relying on god there's no value in relying on a system none whatsoever the system cannot save you a church cannot save you that doesn't mean that it's that a church cannot be a brotherhood and a sisterhood\n\n(08:16) of God's people but the church cannot save you only Jesus can save you so this is the one that you have to trust the one who declared the form of things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and I showed them and I did them suddenly and they came to pass so you can test God by looking at the\n\n(08:36) processes because I knew that our obstinate and my neck is an eye on sinew and eyebrow brass I have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass I showed it to thee lest I should say mine Idol has done them and my graven image and my molten image has commanded them that's fantastic so what\n\n(09:00) is prophecy therefore to remind us that God is in control to remind us that he has the destiny of humanity in his hands and he tells us ahead of time so that we see these things we may believe in the same way all the prophecy that we've dealt with will it save us no but what it can do it can teach us that God after\n\n(09:31) all is worthy of our worship and that's the only thing that prophecy can do it counts I'd you as heard Israel see orders or thou third see all this and will not you declare it I have showed you new things from this time even hidden things allowed it's not know them they are created now and not from the\n\n(09:54) beginning even before the day when they heard not lest thou should say behold I knew them typical humanity we think we can declare everything and explain everything rationally this is not a rational world in my own life I came to a point where it wasn't irrational I cannot cope with us it must be something\n\n(10:16) else and then to find out that God had foretold all the events of history ahead of time so that I might believe that he exists wow that's really something you heard us if not the newest if not get on that time at that time here was not open for I knew that thou would deal very treacherously and what's called a\n\n(10:39) transgressor from the womb that's all we are that's what we are for my namesake I will defer mine anger and for my praise I will refrain for these that i cut be not all behold i have refined thee but not the silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction you know how often have you heard people let's say\n\n(11:03) Christianity to crutch as you heard that I say wow Christianity is a crutch you come and be a Christian and here's my crutch have fun have fun with that crust I'll tell you Christianity is no crutch it's a furnace of affliction and it is painful sometimes why because we have to change it's about character building we\n\n(11:34) have to develop new characters in Jesus Christ you know today the psychologist it's young people come together they go for counseling and the psychologists say you are not compatible you are you have to you are two different you have to be the same if they have the same interest assemblers the same that and the same\n\n(11:55) the other and so we are ruled by all these things what does God do he always puts opposites together have you noticed that he always creates the worst case scenario he does and I'm even in if he chooses evangelist or whatever you'll put a Martin Luther fire brimstone together with the Melancon who's meek and mild\n\n(12:19) and gentle I have a dear friend his name is Francois dupla see small little man like that man do I love that little man he's absolutely the opposite of me he says Walter you knock him over I'll pick him up it's sweet and he can do that and he can put bomb on it says you get into the showroom I'll put on my overall and\n\n(12:49) i'll change the oil and put on the bandage afterwards no that's how you work so God puts together opposite now this fire of affliction who can change your character other than someone that you care about the notice that if I go to work and there's a colleague there and he gives me a hard time I said why\n\n(13:11) and I go home you bother me the way my wife gives me a hard time icon set by so something has to give right and so men ormally have these bombastic characters all times are changing things are shifting around these days but nevertheless who can change you God uses people to change you and it uses those\n\n(13:40) close to you to change you and the fire of affliction is to show you your character nobody can show you your character more than someone is close to you nobody can do it and you are mean to someone and they don't care about me I'm not related to them they'll just ignore me and go away forever so I mean to my\n\n(14:02) wife what then well she can fight back you can do that but you're going to be quiet and just have it here and that tier can be a lot worse than fighting back if you notice that yes so there are really bugs you and worms you and grinds you and gets into your character and into your space and eventually well you get to the\n\n(14:25) point you better start changing because you you cannot be like this anymore you have to soften up you have to be milder you have to be this so God uses people you love to help you change it was painful it is and he says you work at it so it takes two people and he puts them in the fire of affliction and it's the\n\n(14:45) same in the church if you ever thought the church was going to be a hunky dory place oh no these are brothers and sisters of a different kind oh yeah you have all kinds of fish in this net I'll tell you these fish serious fish some of them have got heavy spines on them some of these animals in the ark are\n\n(15:09) unbelievably shot some like the rhinoceros can give you a bump that you are black and blue for six weeks and it's one of those situations where you cannot walk away from it I knew one man Sammy's dead now an old man and he was the most miserable son of a gun I've ever seen in my life he was the worst\n\n(15:35) thing that ever happened to me really was was the worst thing that ever happened to me screamed at me he he did everything in his power to destroy everything I stood for and he drove me nuts sometimes you know I thought I was going to modify him but he was so much older than me so had to be respectful\n\n(15:56) and for all these years God put this man into my life and then he totally left everything he totally lost everything he even went together with a prostitute left his wife everything went wrong and then just about four weeks ago he was dying in the hospital and I got called to his place so I went to him and I said\n\n(16:25) there next to his hospital bed and I looked at him and there he was dying that already amputated pieces he was diabetic and he on his last last last legs and I said then I looked at him and I thought to myself wow just hard not yet he was still hot nuts like they on that bed on his deathbed and I thought what can I\n\n(16:48) tell this man and I say to him you know what you're the worst piece of meat that I ever made you've been so mean to me and i have given you one or two back the two of us we were both two rocks in a river and we were bashing each other and I said you have been the very worst thing I've ever met you and you mean to\n\n(17:17) tell me you're going to die and it's awful nothing also nothing all this pain we went through for nothing I want this time to be worth it and you are going to be in heaven do you understand me that's our smoker I've never spoken to anyone like that on their death bed before never any like quite contemplated and\n\n(17:43) then he said to me yes but it's too late such as why is it too late since I've messed up my entire life and I cannot make it right I said join the club we have all messed up our entire life and we cannot make it right so why don't you take your massive failure and give it to Jesus Christ why don't you give him your\n\n(18:12) failure and then he will make it right he says well how do i go back and fix it I've left my wife I'm living with this from doing this I'm doing the other so what are you going to do you do you think you're going to get up you know that you arm your last legs you're not going to fix that give that failure to\n\n(18:32) the Lord too so if they come back tomorrow so I went back the next day and we talked and it was so nice the tears started rolling down his eyes and he gave his life to the Lord and everything changed he knew the truth he said to me you know I hate it when one group thinks they have the truth I hate it when they think they have the\n\n(18:56) truth what right have they got to have the truth it's true you know many people say well you say we'll stay adventist you think you have the truth what a miserable bunch and everybody else what are they gonna lie I think you're not really if you think about it it's not a complicated doctrine it's not a\n\n(19:17) complicated doctrine at all it's love Jesus for what he has done for you give him the honor and the glory and be obedient isn't it logical to keep the commandments of god yes it's logical then with your problem that's the whole thing obedience and faith in his merit that's it that's the gospel in a nutshell what's wrong with that are you\n\n(19:41) satisfied with a changed gospel with changed Commandments ten percent discount in our denomination or whatever you only have to keep nine not one where ten percent discount whatever any show thinking and he made his position and he died quite peacefully and you know when I had the privilege of actually doing\n\n(20:04) the sermon at his burial and everybody was there his family was there his wife was there his girlfriend was there they were all together and they were all hugging each other it's been impossible that's fire of affliction so the Lord puts us in situations where we come into contact with those that we love and we\n\n(20:27) can run away from it or we can allow it to change us and that's our choice and if we create tears and if we create pain then what we can say is the problem lies with me and once I come to realize that the problem lies with me then God can work with us for my own sake even for my own sake will I do it for how should my\n\n(20:54) name be polluted and I will not give my glory unto another hearken unto me Oh Jacob Israel my called I am he I am the first I also am the last mine hand also has laid the foundations of the earth and my right hand has spanned the heavens when I call unto them they stand up together acknowledge God all ye assemble\n\n(21:17) yourselves in here which amongst you has declared these things the Lord has loved him he will do his pleasure on Babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldean see a nice comparing those who set up their own standards who have their own religion who does need God that's what the calcium stood for Bob L another\n\n(21:39) portal to God I even I have spoken I've called him I brought in and he shall make his way prosperous come you near unto me here yeezus I have not spoken in secret from the beginning and from the time that it was there I am and now the Lord God and His Spirit has sent me thus says the Lord thy Redeemer the Holy One\n\n(22:01) of Israel i am the lord thy god which teaches me to profit which leadeth me by the way that thou should go and God knows best why not follow him oh that I was talkin to my commandment you see how gospel is here in this little piece then heads I peace been as a river and I righteousness as the waves of the sea\n\n(22:25) God's commandments on expression of his love thy seed also had been as the sand on the offspring of their bowels like the gravel there of his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me go me forth of Babylon flee from the Chaldeans with a voice of singing declare he tells us utter it\n\n(22:46) even to the end of the earth sagi the Lord has redeemed his servant Jacob can you see the gospel there stay away from that which says I can do it I can reach God myself by my works whatever the system is if we don't have the Lord has done this he has redeemed me we're not in the right religion this is the gospel\n\n(23:14) if they are talking to my Commandments then I peace had been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea it's a notice complicated doctrine to very simple doctrine we make it complicated so what is the final warning to the world it's embodied in the three angels messages and we find them in the\n\n(23:38) book of Revelation just subsequent to the verses that we've already read the first angels message what is that all about well let's read it and I saw another angel that's a messenger flying in the midst of heaven spreading these lights across the whole heavenly divide having the everlasting gospel to preach\n\n(24:01) unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship Him that made heaven and earth and the sea and The Fountains of water again other there revelation 14 6 and 7 you have the\n\n(24:29) seal of God so the first angels message says we're living in judgment time pay attention to the word worship God worship God worship Him who made the heavens the earth the sea and The Fountains of water what do I have to do to tell the world that I acknowledge him as such simple just keep the Sabbath the\n\n(24:53) white because that's the heart of the Sabbath commandment in six days the Lord made the heavens the earth the sea and what they mean therefore he commanded you to keep holy the Sabbath day in Deuteronomy chapter 5 you were slaves in Egypt and the Lord took you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched\n\n(25:15) arm therefore the LORD commanded you to keep Oliver Sabbath day the Sabbath is a sign of creation the Sabbath is a sign of redemption he took us out of the land of sin and brought us into the fountain of His grace so as we were created by him so we were redeemed by him if you look at the Jewish system there were seven annual\n\n(25:44) Jewish feasts in type and aunty types there was the Passover Nissan 14 and that represented the crucifixion because they're the lamb was slain and the blood of the lamb was painted on the doorpost and so we have to put the blood of the lamb on the doorposts of our heart and then the angel of the Lord that will\n\n(26:11) come in judgment will pass us by so if we accept our Passover as that was sacrificed for us then we acknowledge the crucifixion the land that died in our stead the second Jewish feast was the feast of unleavened bread notice it was very next day Nissan 15 the unleavened bread the bread without yeast\n\n(26:41) represents what the body of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ in the grave so he was crucified for us and he died for us rested in the grave on the seventh day and the very next day was nice on 16 was the first to first the food of feast of first fruits and that represents the resurrection Jesus the firstfruits he's\n\n(27:10) the one who was raised from the dead and the graves opened up and people came out of their graves says the Bible and when he went into heaven he took captives in his trainer that is the resurrection so in their annual feast the Jews were actually pre-empting the greatest event in history that would come and the\n\n(27:35) crucifixion the death in the grave and the resurrection was celebrated in the feet then I had the feast of weeks which was on 76 and that commemorates at the same time period after the Passover that it took before the law was issued and then came Pentecost and it typifies the giving of the law of course was a type\n\n(28:04) and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit spreading the message abroad was part of their annual fees to type of Pentecost and then there were three other fears the Feast of Trumpets tishri one it held the judgment second Advent movement a trumpet sounding saying a great event is going to take place comforts were\n\n(28:30) sounded before the judgment so it held that the judgment or the second Advent movement which says the time of his judgment has come then there was the Day of Atonement history 10 as the pre Advent judgment obviously God is judging because when he comes again his reward is with him his murderer so if he comes\n\n(28:57) with his reward then obviously is prejudged so that judgment is taking place in heaven at the moment so that was the day of atonement and it represented this time when the high priest was in the most holy and when he came out of there and then the sins were in type transferred to the goat and he was led off in the wilderness note he\n\n(29:22) didn't die so he didn't become a since barren and a substitute he was taken away and the sins that had been confessed were removed from the sanctuary and eternally wiped off as though they had never existed and the final feast they had was t Sharif risking the Feast of Tabernacles where they're made booths for themselves and\n\n(29:48) celebrated in great happiness that is the type of home going the second Advent so in the annual Jewish feast you had the whole gospel story embodied the day of atonement is the annual cleansing of the earthly sanctuary so they have a high priest went in with the blood and he appreciated in the most holy and he\n\n(30:14) made atonement for the entire sanctuary coming up cleansing the sanctuary of the record of sin so the Day of Atonement was a day of judgement the day of judgement had come the high priest took blood and he went into the most holy and he sprinkled it and he made atonement for the sanctuary and the uncleanness of\n\n(30:44) the people now what is the standard of judgment James tells us James chapter 1 verse 25 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continuous therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed James 2 verse 12 so speaking and so do as they that shall be\n\n(31:13) judged by the law of Liberty wonderful name for the law of Liberty will all set you free it's not a law of bondage if everybody had to keep the law on this planet wouldn't we all be free yes or no absolutely there's logic in it your peace would have been like a river and your righteousness like to see if\n\n(31:38) everybody kept the law what is sin whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law 1 John 3 verse 4 that's what sin is so if you want to have a relationship of obedience well you have to keep the law of God when our law is there is no transgression Romans 4 15 so there must have been a law from\n\n(32:07) the beginning yes no otherwise there would have been no transgression for the wages of sin is dead but what is the real verse that comes thereafter ah but the gift of God is eternal life isn't that sir to his righteousness so this is the full gospel wages of sin death a gift of God eternal life enjoy in in Christ Jesus now wages\n\n(32:46) is something that you get for what you do is my wife so if you choose to break the law of God the consequences did the solution to that since we all did that is salvation by faith through grace isn't that right we are all saved by grace does that mean we must leave as this sentence up that we should not sit\n\n(33:11) sin separates from God your iniquities have separated you from your God Isaiah 59 verse 24 the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord there's the whole verse this is an everlasting gospel sin kill life is in Christ so accept life in Christ and stop sinning\n\n(33:41) is that biblical what did Jesus say to the woman caught in adultery yes exactly he says where are your accusers and she answers I don't know that Lord they had left and he says neither do i condemn you that's great go and sin no more or what is that obedience that's the everlasting gospel but today the world\n\n(34:14) has modified the everlasting school they always leave one arm one leg of it out you have to have the full story for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid Romans 6 14 and 15 is the law done away with because we\n\n(34:41) are under grace should we now break the law because we are under grace no remember that quote from the charismatic churches that I read where it said that if you keep the law of God you haven't got the Holy Spirit wow what kind of gospel is the world teaching today therefore by the deeds of the law there\n\n(35:01) shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin Romans 3 19 and 20 so I'm not saved by my good work son saved because I have a savior absolutely it's the only reason why I'm saved but the law tells me what's right and wrong and therefore I know what's right and wrong and I can\n\n(35:25) distinguish do we then make void the law through faith god forbid gay we established the law romans 3 verse 31 so in other words we should be doers of the law not to save ourselves but because we love the Lord wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rather than 7 12 there's no such\n\n(35:51) thing as we don't have to keep the law of God four Gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John people say you know they repeat each other they don't they augment each other yes but they don't repeat each other in Matthew Christ is depicted as the king in mark Christ is depicted as the servant in Luke Christ is depicted\n\n(36:14) as fully man in johnny is depicted as fully divine all of it in one if we want to represent the everlasting gospel we have to put law and grace into perspective and we have to serve Jesus as king we have to emulate him as servants he was a man he died for us so that he can feel our humanity and share\n\n(36:40) in our weaknesses and we must acknowledge him as God there's nothing less cannot be molten the five books of Moses Genesis the book of origins the fall and the promise of redemption Exodus Christ our sanctuary he's the one who leads us the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire Leviticus Christ our sacrifice numbers Christ our guide\n\n(37:08) Deuteronomy Christ our reward the whole Bible is about Jesus Christ that's the everlasting gospel don't you think the world has missed out somewhere along the line now some people say we only need the New Testament so why bother carrying such a heavy book get a nice pair of scissors and cut the rest off throw it\n\n(37:28) away if you don't need it anymore no the Old Testament and the New Testament they all talk about Jesus think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I have not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle Will shall no wise pass from\n\n(37:49) the law till all be fulfilled Matthew 5 17 and 18 the everlasting gospel must be preached it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear then for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the law Luke 16 verse 17 not one iota of the law is going to disappear even the NIV has a droid this is love for God to obey his\n\n(38:14) commands would be better if they had Commandments like the King James hazard and his commands commandments are not burdensome 1 John 5 verse 3 His commandments are not burdensome and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obey Him Hebrews 59 so the world has de-emphasized obedience and\n\n(38:40) overemphasized salvation by grace salvation by grace is the primary there is no doubt about it because without that we are all lost but without obedient we won't get there either so the law of God has been done away with and why do you find it in the New Testament this is the New Testament thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him\n\n(39:04) only shalt thou serve Matthew 14 revelation 19 10 little children keep yourselves from idols 1 John 5 21 acts 17 29 at the name of God and his doctrine be not blaspheme 176 1 the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath day for the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath mark 2 27 28 he was 44 honor thy father and thy mother\n\n(39:30) Matthew 19 19 Ephesians 6 13 thou shalt not kill Robin 13-9 James to 11 thou shalt not commit adultery Matthew 19 18 thou shalt not steal Romans 13 9 Ephesians 4 20 thou shalt not bear false witness Romans 13 9 thou shalt not cover Drummond 77 but you're in trouble if you're saying the Lord's been done away\n\n(39:51) with in the New Testament because there it is in the New Testament you're in big trouble so we cannot eliminate the law of God the tabernacle was pitched in the midst of the people Jesus in the midst of his people that's what it stands for the everlasting gospel it has never ever changed the Lamb of God that takes away\n\n(40:14) the sins of the world it was brought to the high priest he died instead of the sinner every Jew in the past was saved by the blood of the Lamb there's no such thing as the Jews were under law and we are under grace then how come a Jew had to bring a land because he was under grace because he was under grace that's\n\n(40:39) why behold the lamb of God which takes away the sins of the world John 129 my little children these things right on to you that you sanat anything man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous one on to verse 9 I was speaking to a Muslim one and he said to me you Christians have an easy life I said what he says\n\n(41:08) you Christians you just do whatever you like you still and then you say that forgive me and it's done and you send them all we can't do that I said yeah that's what Christianity has become you're right I actually stand ashamed before you that that is a fact is that real Christianity did Christ died so\n\n(41:30) that we can continue sinning I don't think so true Christianity is acknowledging the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and asking him to clean up our act to get off our high horse and to acknowledge our weakness and our sin and to cling to the Advocate the only hope we have there are fortunate we are that the great judge of the universe also\n\n(41:58) happens to be our advocate can you imagine anything nicer than that the judge who is going to judge you is also your advocate the judge says you know I think you are guilty of this and then the same judge says yes but I paid the price Wow let's teach you then say thank you thank you and love the Savior so\n\n(42:28) much is that you stop doing what you did before if you were given a reprieve in a prison cell for some wicked deeds that you had done would it be right to say well now I'm free to go and do it again and again some actually do that you know or would it be better to say I have always been given a free by will never\n\n(42:52) do that again which one would be the better of the two options obviously the latter he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed if we confess our sins faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all\n\n(43:15) unrighteousness 1 John 19 I was once talking to a minister and he said to me the law has been done away with your illegal list I said well you mind if I take your wife home with me tonight let's might be a bit harsh of course my wife was with me so I could say that but the fact of the matter is then he said\n\n(43:42) no of course not I said well what if I killed one of you of you would that be okay or how about if I took your car or how about you know I went through the Ten Commandments that's all there which one is the problem the Sabbath is the problem not the other nine but because there is no argument to have to\n\n(44:05) sometimes get rid of it all to get rid of the one if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if there is the crux of the first angels message we're living in judgment time there's an everlasting gospel it has never changed we have\n\n(44:27) nullified it we have cauterized it we have cut it into half we must go back to the original and we must acknowledge the one who made the heavens the earth the sea and the springs of water that's what we have to do that's the first angel and then followed a second angel the second Angels message is a frightening message\n\n(44:55) you see if you reject the message of the first angel then you are rejecting right and if you reject like eventually you will sit where in darkness so what is the 2nd angels message said and they followed another angel saying Babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all the nations drink of the\n\n(45:23) wine the wrath of her fornication Revelation 14 8 that's the 2nd angels message it's a powerful message and this is the message that must go to the entire world so what point is there if I go to the world and I said to them well Babylon is fallen would that make any difference wouldn't I have to explain to someone\n\n(45:50) what Babylon ease before I can tell them that it's fallen yes or no absolutely people don't know what Babylon is and what's the point of giving this message so who is babylon you have to go to ancient Babylon to find out what Babylon is what was babylon babylon was a religious system that was very very Wow\n\n(46:14) attractive to the Israelites and they went and chose that religion nine times out of ten over their own religion they kept on going back to Babylon why because it's so much more comfortable to have your own way to God rather than listen to his requirements the wine of Babylon what is the wine of Babylon the\n\n(46:38) wine of Babylon is false doctrine to selected messages 60a to the wine of Babylon is the exalting of the false and spurious Sabbath above the Sabbath which the Lord Jehovah has blessed and sanctified for the use of man also the immortality of the soul these kindred heresies and the rejection of the truth\n\n(46:59) convert the church into Babylon Kings merchants rulers religious teachers are all in corrupt harmony yes today the church is following or the rulers of the world are following the church where the legislation 16 13 and 14 and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth\n\n(47:26) of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirits of devil working miracles which go and forth the kings of the earth one of the whole world to gather them to the Battle of that great day of God Almighty revelation 16 13 and 14 scary alright and in actual fact we're talking about\n\n(47:50) the Babylon system consists of three component and they're run by and clean spirits like frogs frogs were one of the plagues in Egypt because frogs were one of the words deities in the Egyptian system so here they are and they're out of the mouth of the dragon the bees and the false prophet those three components\n\n(48:15) and experts of devils working miracles counteracting that years the patience of the saints ii or they that keep the commandments of god in the face of Jesus revelation 14 12 two messages what are these messengers and who is this woman Babylon that has the whole world worshipping at its feet so mystic\n\n(48:38) Babylon has these three components the dragon the beast and the false prophet and we've dealt with them in quite some detail in these lectures is a brunch frog and this is in Japan where they have the worship of the deity which is for the mother child just like the ISIS of Cyrus system and they still worship\n\n(49:06) these frogs on the outside so don't think this worship system is over it's the ancient old babylonian system of worship bronze frog combined the sun with water symbolizing fertility so unesco tells us they should know what is the dragon while the dragon is identified in the Bible as Satan that old serpent so everything that deals\n\n(49:33) with spiritism with demonic forces directly orchestrate mankind is part of the dragon system so that would include for example which cross does which cross will lead astray but witchcraft what is got to do with the church what is the church starts saying we must hold sÃ©ances as the Church of England did\n\n(50:00) doesn't witchcraft then become part of the church doesn't a Babylonian worship system creep into the church who are these priests of Rome the wandering bishops who deal with the occult and run the scenes behind the New Age movement what about world philosophy and Rand the virtue of selfishness is their virtue in\n\n(50:29) selfishness no but in human thinking there is virtue in selfishness like Robert Schuller teachers self-esteem is what you really need not God esteem self esteem I thought he must increase I must decrease did you know some things which is a little secret and that is the truth and error or like this they are like\n\n(50:58) this do you know if you are willing to surrender your self esteem to Christ you actually increase in its in its team it's amazing but it's a fact think about it because you have the god of the universe acknowledging you as his child you comin come become a son or a daughter of the Most High and Prince to\n\n(51:26) sit on a throne together with him Wow if there isn't something then worry but you have to learn humility from him in order to qualify here we're learning something else what about what we heard from this lovely lady JZ Knight you are God forget about Jesus Christ he's just one of the crowd spiritism in all its forms when\n\n(52:01) man sits him up self up as a god to be worshipped so we have all the god-kings the Dalai Lama's all these people in the worship systems of the world and these worship systems are all coming together in the United Nations to form one big United religion and we have to acknowledge the same deity behind them all I have a\n\n(52:26) problem with that how can I acknowledge a deity that exalts elf if I worship a deity that stands for humility the two are incompatible but all of these are coming together into one super system bhagwan shree worshipped as a human being does it really give you self-esteem and robbed you of your dignity or matreya as he appeared in\n\n(52:54) Nairobi and people worshipping Him as Jesus Christ we are told in the churches today that Harry Potter is just great and kids dress up as harry potter to come and practice these values in the church this is witchcraft so has the church not incorporated witchcraft in its system yes or no at least tolerated\n\n(53:19) it there are many many in the church who are horrified as they see what is happening and I presume God is permitting it to get worse and worse and worse and worse so they can wake up and see what has become of the church the church has become Babylon by allowing dragon worship into it's very much what\n\n(53:43) about modern modern spiritualism with the Fox sisters where they are started with a rapping tap tap tap tap tap eventually it went into full-blown sciences and demonic worshipped well we saw that the founding fathers of the modern Christian movements the psychic research organizations where the great\n\n(54:09) bishops we've got hot all of these that actually rewrote the Bible for us if you like that they had their ghosts diocese and communicated with spirits isn't that spiritualism in the church spiritualism says that the dead no more than the living and the certain said unto the woman ye shall not surely die\n\n(54:32) Genesis 3 verse 4 in this case as in many other Bible passages the devil told the truth and the Lord is in error ews pag spiritualist straight out they don't mince words the fundamental principle of spiritism is that the human being survived bodily death and that occasionally and the conditions not yet\n\n(54:56) fully understood we can communicate with those who have gone before J Arthur Hill spiritism history phenomena and doctrine page 25 this is spiritism in the world the Bible says when you die the dead your only hope is the resurrection that's your only hope specials and claims the dead communicate there is no\n\n(55:19) death in the graveyard I have frequent talks with a dead I cannot doubt that the people live off the death for I frequently talk with them so Oliver Lodge said well 1 Kings do it all over the place Prince child has regular sessions with month battle who's been dead for a very long time and he's the head official head of the Church of\n\n(55:43) England is there spiritism in the church yes or no absolutely there's spiritism in the church progressive thinker may eighteen nineteen twenty nine what spiritualism isn't does it removes all fear of death which is really the portal to the spirit world it teaches that death is not explanation of life but\n\n(56:02) Amir change of condition spiritualism is God's message to mortals declaring that there is no death what does that do with God makes him or what makes him a liar that's right that all we're fast on still lives that there is hope in the life beyond for the most sinful that every soul will progress through the\n\n(56:22) ages to hide sublime and glorious where God is love and love is God the world up there is living a lie I have spiritualistic sound information tapes if you like of a session with vessel John Rhodes because he's dead but he speaks to the Spiritist and he explains who the hierarchy is in the hip on the other side and the most\n\n(56:49) wicked people on this earth according to this spiritualistic seance or highers and jesus christ on the other side Adolf Hitler for example is higher on the other side than Jesus Christ could you have more experience here on earth then again you believe that well these are terrible terrible doctrines doctrines of\n\n(57:12) devils being propagated in churches because virtually all churches today propagate this doctrine of continued life who did Alice a bailey speak to when she spoke to dwell cool the dead are waiting for the resurrection and who did you speak to who is dwell cool he's a demon that's what he is here's the\n\n(57:39) official website of the Church of Satan this man over here Anton LaVey do they have good doctrines yes but the Church of Satan is a recognized church in the world standing side by side with the other churches in a community of all the churches what is light and darkness got in common as the world gone mad is the\n\n(58:03) high priest of Satanism he's supposedly responsible so I don't know how many sacrifices of human and satanic news on the March what is this satanic bible say 1969 anton lavey the founder Satan represents indulgence instead of abstinence Satan represents vital existence instead of spiritual pipe dreams Satan represents undefiled wisdom\n\n(58:29) instead of hypocritical self defeat Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on Ingrid you know what the kingdom of heaven is made of such as these go here into the highways by ways go and fix the lame and the crippled into the center that often we despise them no no love them take them\n\n(58:57) into the arms of the church because they will make up the kingdom of heaven let Satan laugh at our weaknesses and at our cripples mind and at our crippled bodies he ain't seen nothing yet wait till they are transformed and receive that which God has in store for us he will still be judged by them so Satan represents\n\n(59:24) vengeance instead of turning the other cheek Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for psychic vampires certain represents man is just another animal sometimes better more often worse than those that walk on all fours who because of his divine spiritual and intellectual development\n\n(59:42) has become the most vicious animals so we God same teaching Satan represents all of the so-called sins as they all lead to physical mental and emotional gratification and Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had as he has kept it in business all these years that's Anton LaVey Bible now you\n\n(1:00:05) look at it how much of this is actually slipped into church doctrine today surprising frightful amount the all-seeing eye of Lucifer only are some interesting things here the wedge of the eye this little thing in the middle the eye of Lucifer did you know that that was the first little computer game in\n\n(1:00:28) the world pac-man kept a cup remember that gobbled up everything yeah interesting wow so spiritualism the dragon component is everything that has to do with demonic activity dress up sometimes as churchy sometimes as pure demonic Satanism and all are welcome in the falls of Babylon what about the beach well that's\n\n(1:00:59) unfortunately that's what the Bible teaches all the attributes of the papacy applied to the beast power is the one who has the sign of Horus and the world religion will be subject to him he's all things to all men very receives the talaxian Hinduism there he kisses the Quran reach out to these things a dead\n\n(1:01:23) christ cannot communicate a body of Christ of God literally making God from a morsel of bread well can he save you know believe me I tried to talk to him he doesn't answer it doesn't answer and substituting Mary this is the coat of arms of the Vatican the dragon on the papal christened the vatican museum\n\n(1:01:51) Vatis diviner concert and vodka khan divining serpent that's what it means so we follow the beast power we're in trouble revelation 13 4 and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the bees and they worshipped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him so if\n\n(1:02:14) we acknowledge Rome as the spiritual head of the churches well then we are acknowledging the leadership of Babylon rather than the leadership of Jesus Christ at what the end of the Jesuit same according to them they only seek the greater glory of God but if you examine the fact you will find that the\n\n(1:02:35) am at universal dominion alone they have rendered themselves indispensable to the Pope who without them could not exist because Catholicism is identified with them they rendered themselves indispensable to governance whole revolutions in the hand and in this way either under one name or another it is\n\n(1:02:53) they who rule the world just fact all these revolutions we spoke about all this death and all this man under their control so that by creating chaos they can create the world order that they want and we have to be sub to them so that is the other component of Babylon who's the false prophet that's very sad and I saw another beast\n\n(1:03:23) coming up out of the earth it had two horns like a lamb this was another Christian system spoke like a dragon and we discussed this in Revelation 13 this was the Protestant United States coming up and taking power and making an image unto the bees becoming like it and Protestantism which is supposed to stand\n\n(1:03:49) for freedom and righteousness is actually today masonry in disguise that you have Liberty masonic my holy alliance which is an unholy alliance the wall of separation between church and state is a metaphor based on bad history and so Rome would bound the Protestant churches adopted beast katic characteristics and the Church of\n\n(1:04:22) England here changed its faith and became like the beasts we discussed all that and we had to look at all their teachings and what they are teaching and how it's totally contrary to the Bible what Shula said what the Bible said all these things how Shula said and we can pray our Father in Heaven honorable is\n\n(1:04:45) our name to be gone born-again means that we must be changed from a negative to a positive self-image a religion based on self a religion based on worldly values a religion honoring mankind to the level of beauty this is sin this is sin and needs to be called by the right name where the Billy Graham\n\n(1:05:09) endorses it or not the Bible and the Bible alone whether he sits with a pope or not he has endorsed it what about the charismatic movement it says when he says I I just smile and say yes I am too is this bull Christianity I don't think so promise keepers Kenneth Hagin magazine obelisks and we have a form of godliness\n\n(1:05:42) denying the power they're all it's very sad Oh Benny Hinn which says I am I am I am I am don't say I have sian you are everything he was and everything he is and ever shall be is that Christianity I don't think so so what is this this is false prophecy this is false preaching this is a lie and it has to be exposed\n\n(1:06:11) and so the dragon component in the churches and the beast component in the churches and the false prophet component in the churches has to be exposed for what it is and the message goes to the world Babylon is not what it seems it's fallen it's fallen and then follows another angel now do you think the\n\n(1:06:40) churches will accept this rebuke yes or no no they won't accept it well individuals accepted thank God for that or else all preaching would be in vain the third angels message what is that same revelation 14 9 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice of any man worship the Beast and His\n\n(1:07:04) image and receive the mark he's mark in his forehead on his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb Wow never has a\n\n(1:07:24) message like that corner from God this is powerful stuff and we've dealt with us actually already because we've dealt with the mark in the forest and in the hand when we dealt with revelation Keane's I point you to that so what was it what was it all about the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God\n\n(1:07:47) which is poured out without mixture without mercy this time total destruction into the cup of his indignation and you shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the land what does that mean two lectures coming up on that storm and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up\n\n(1:08:09) forever and ever what does that mean and they have no rest day or night who worship the Beast and His image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name what does that mean what is this forever and ever and ever and ever well it'll take two lectures to clarify the last two and then we'll have eternal peace\n\n(1:08:29) after that revelation 14 nine to ten point six days the Lord made heaven see us to sea and all that in the Me's and rested on the seventh day wherefore the Lord bless the saddest day and hallowed it exodus 28 remember that it is a sign between me and the Lord that he rested on the seventh day and he was refreshed\n\n(1:08:53) in the sign meant a mark so God has a mosca DC Sabbath you must understand God's mock he's fine he feel we went through this in Revelation chapter 13 and the Lord delivered to me two tablets of stone written with a finger of God they were not to be messed with Deuteronomy 9 verse 10 so God feel God's\n\n(1:09:17) markers in the heart of his Lords the Sabbath and it gives authority as we have said to the whole law now all we say is by keeping the law no let's get this quite clear but without keeping the law will we be saved no see what was also can't the question as well now the point is this if we're not saved by\n\n(1:09:41) keeping the law then how are we saved by grace grace saves us one hundred percent grace saves us we are saved great so if I now keep the law what am I acknowledging by keeping the law I'm acknowledging a higher authority than myself is that correct if I keep the law I am acknowledging a higher power than\n\n(1:10:12) myself and if I keep it exactly like he said I'm acknowledging his authority is that correct so who's righteousness and I acknowledging Jesus's so don't think that by saying keep the law you are legalistic no in actual fact by keeping the law if you do it right you are propagating righteousness by faith\n\n(1:10:38) because you are acknowledging his superiority in your life you are acknowledging your dependence upon him and you come in line with his wishes because you are acknowledging his fullness of understanding the sonic sense so by not accepting man's laws but accepting God's laws I acknowledge my dependence upon him and I accept his\n\n(1:11:12) righteousness by faith so the mark of the beast message involves righteousness by faith and obedience as a consequence as simple as that but the Lord creator heaven and earth that's his stamp his name is titled his territory I gave them my Sabbath's as a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the\n\n(1:11:39) lord that sanctifies them so where does your righteousness come from from him not from me this is righteousness by faith so the third angels message is righteousness by faith in Verity absolutely it could be construed as legalism if you wanted to but in actual fact what you are doing by key being the law if you understand it\n\n(1:12:08) correctly is acknowledging a higher power and it will be if you will listen carefully to my commandments which I command you to tell you to take you to yourselves that your heart may not be deceived and you turn aside and serve other gods and worship them therefore you shall lay up these my words in your\n\n(1:12:25) hearts and in your souls and bind them for a sign upon your hand so that they may be fun slips between your eyes Deuteronomy 1113 Twinkie so we act accordingly we think accordingly and the mark of the beast sunday is our lack of authority but they say it themselves the church is above the Bible in this\n\n(1:12:46) transference of the Sabbath observance is proof of that fact Catholic record September 123 she took the pagan Sunday she made it the Christian Sunday the pagan Sunday dedicated to Boulder became the Christian Sunday's sacred to Jesus and she acknowledges it uses of course the Catholic Church claims that the\n\n(1:13:05) change was her act and the act is a mark of a classical power that's not a question so much of a day as it is of authority if I obey this system I am exalting human laws and basically i'm saying i'm getting my sanctification from whom from the church and that's what you are no judge can give me sanctification not even the one that I\n\n(1:13:34) mean no church can give me sanctification only Jesus Christ can give me sanctification that's it no one else the Bible says remember that I'll keep holy the Sabbath day the Catholic Church says no by my divine power I abolished the Sabbath day and command you to keep holy the first day of the week and lo the entire civilized world\n\n(1:13:56) bow down in reverent obedience to the command of the Holy Catholic Church for the invite American central they're pretty arrogant about it pretty arrogant about it so who do I acknowledge the earthly powers or the heavenly powers that's the question choose the whom you want to acknowledge God or man\n\n(1:14:17) the power of sanctification to God or the power of sanctification through man which leads to death because how can men save you pope pius 1566 commanded the council of 20 please the church of god that the religious celebration of the sabbath day should be transferred to the Lord stay catechist most Romano and\n\n(1:14:37) unfortunately all the world wonders after the beast so the third angels message is do not acknowledge man's law superior to God's law the test will be the Sabbath might they put a microchip into your hand maybe maybe to control your buying and selling but a chip is not your character of allegiance but\n\n(1:15:08) your character or the legion sees is obedience to God's commandment they must be on your forehead and on your hand the Catholic Church is happy if it's on your hand or your forest these are subtle differences the Bible says in Deuteronomy bind it as frontlets between your eyes and your hands the best mark\n\n(1:15:30) of the piece is in the forest or the head why that subtle difference because the Catholic Church is satisfied if you keep it because you are convinced it's right but it's also satisfied if you do it because you have to do without acknowledging anything just being obedient is good enough well it's not\n\n(1:15:55) good enough you'd be obedient to God here's the pensions of the sent here they keep the commandments of God and the face of Jesus revelation 14 well this message will become even more powerful when in Revelation 18 after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory\n\n(1:16:14) and he cried mightily with a strong voice Babylon is fallen Babylon is fallen now look what has happened she has become a habitation of devils and the hold of every fowl cage of every unclean and hateful bird well if you reject God well then you get demon for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication\n\n(1:16:38) and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth of waxed rich etc etc etc and I heard another voice saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of a certain that you receive not of her play so God is going to call these people out of Babylon they\n\n(1:16:58) have to come out they have to see that a nursery system has been built up which does not lead to righteousness and have no fellowship with the unfruitful be works of darkness but rather expose them Ephesians 5 verse 11 that's the last message of warning to the world it's a tough message it's a very tough message\n\n(1:17:21) and a very unpopular message and then there will be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time when this message finishes up this planet's not going to look the same anymore and either dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the\n\n(1:17:43) Almighty Psalms 91 verse 1 if you choose the Lord you have nothing to fear he'll take care of you he's promised to do so it didn't promised you a rose garden at least he's not a liar at least he didn't promise you utopia and then doesn't deliver he says it's going to be tough but i'll take care of you and then a\n\n(1:18:06) decree will go up he that is unjust let him be unjust go and he which is fussy let him be four system and he that is righteous let him be righteous too and he that is holy let him be holy stalled probation closes the decision has been made and then after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven with\n\n(1:18:32) great power and the earth was lighted with his glory God's people will come out of Babylon and I heard a voice from heaven revelation 14 13 and 14 saying unto me write blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth strange sentence yes is the spirit that they may rest from their labors and their works\n\n(1:18:55) do follow them and I looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud set one like unto the Son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle what's a sickle for harvest time of our vez well if you die well that's a blessing in a way because the Lord will raise you up nothing to fear\n\n(1:19:22) if you're alive that's a blessing because you're soon coming looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the Great God and our Savior Jesus Christ Titus 213 so very next act this is the final message of warning to a world followed by the coming of Christ for the great day of his wrath has come and who will be able\n\n(1:19:45) to stand will have to answer that question revelation 6 17 and we'll look at it in detail as we go into another lecture and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time has come for the two wreaths and for the arvest\n\n(1:20:04) of the earth is ripe and either sat on the cloud trusting the sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped so there's a redemptive reaping and another angel came out of temple which is in heaven also having a sharp sickle and another angel came from the altar which had power of a fire and cried with a\n\n(1:20:26) loud voice to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrusting the sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for a great of fully ripe so there's a first harvest and now there's a second harvest and Angel thrusting his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cost it into the\n\n(1:20:47) great winepress of the wrath of God and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse's bridle by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs what does all this mean well wine is doctrine and here is a doctrine of the earth as opposed to the heavenly doctrine and this doctrine will\n\n(1:21:12) come up and bury the horses what is the horse Stanfill the gospel Herald so this gospel Herald that was spread from this earth and was a lie because it was earthly and left Jesus Christ out will bury in its own in buried in its own iniquity and it will disappear forever so the choice is between the one system\n\n(1:21:38) or the other we either go with Christ when he comes or we form form part of the other harvest the choice is out and that final message of warning as hard as it sounds is a message of love because it calls us to acknowledge Jesus think of a simplicity of it my people he's basically saying I love you it is time\n\n(1:22:06) for judgment to come why don't you leave the evil philosophies of the surf why do you want to be steeped in evolution and all these philosophies why don't you acknowledge me as your creator and your Redeemer why do you want to follow philosophies that exalt the human and denigrate the divine why don't you want\n\n(1:22:35) to look up for your salvation then look down don't you want to obey me and my precepts so that it may be well with you don't you want to acknowledge me because I am the one who sanctifies you and makes you whole and makes your sons and daughters of the Most High that's the message isn't it a nice message it's a\n\n(1:23:00) sweet call from the Lord above saying come my children why would you be lost and you can listen though you can reject that's the final message to this world it's tough but I believe it's true amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and [Music] [Music]",
  "# Title:231_the_loud_cry_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_thegreatcontroversy_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nLoud Cry Message,Babylon's Fall,Spiritual Deception,Worldly Systems,Final Warning\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"The Loud Cry,\" analyzes Revelation chapter 18, presenting its verses as a chiasm with alternating heavenly and earthly \"songs\" that deliver proclamations of warning, victory, and woe. The core message emphasizes that \"Babylon the great is fallen,\" a religious system now controlled by \"spirits of demons,\" and that all nations, rulers, and merchants have become entangled in its corrupting influence. A crucial \"loud cry\" from heaven urges God's people to \"come out of her\" (Babylon) to avoid partaking in its sins and plagues, highlighting a call for separation from false worship. The speaker details how this global system encompasses not only religious structures but also economic and political powers, often operating through secret societies and occult symbolism in various mega-companies and the entertainment industry, using music and drugs to lead people into altered states of consciousness. Ultimately, the source proclaims Babylon's inevitable destruction by fire, urging individual repentance and a complete commitment to Christ, foreseeing a final, powerful outpouring of truth before the end of earth's history.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 231 - The Loud Cry _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org #THEGREATCONTROVERSY - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_1Okl3ttkU\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well this lecture now as you can see is titled loud cry it's basically a study of Revelation chapter 18 Revelation 18 is written as a kaym and there is a kaym of songs the first two songs are Heavenly songs they are Heavenly beings that sing these songs verses 2 and four songs\n\n(01:29) three 3 to 5 are Earthly verses 9 11 and 17 and songs 6 to7 are Heavenly verses 21 and 19 verse one so all of these are a kaym so we have one and two Heavenly 3 to five Earthly six and seven Heavenly and these are great proclamations to the world a proclamation of warning and a proclamation of Victory with a\n\n(02:04) proclamation of Woe by the Earthly ones in between the first Heavenly song Heavenly song One Revelation 18:1 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighted with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen is\n\n(02:29) Fallen where did we hear that before Revelation 14 it was the second Angel's message and the second Angel's message said is Fallen has fallen because that made the Nations drink of the wine of the WTH of a fornication that's where it ended now the second Angel's message is going to be boosted with additional\n\n(02:54) information Babylon the great is Fallen is Fallen has become a habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird H that's kind of powerful language that means that the religious systems of the world will be controlled not by the spirit of God but by\n\n(03:17) what spirits of demons that's a very very serious situation every foul spirit and every unclean and hateful bird when the Holy Spirit was likened to a bird what bird was used as a symbol a dove is that a clean or an unclean bird it's a clean bird now we have an unclean bird so here is an unclean Spirit\n\n(03:44) masquerading as the spirit of God have we seen such a spirit in some of the churches in the world didn't we look at some of the videos and what we saw and what Terrible Things transpire and how these people then that bring about all these manifestations in the churches actually say that they themselves are\n\n(04:06) God and that well they could have saved the world all these things is that the spirit of God or is that the spirit of another kind it must be a spirit of Another Kind Revelation 18:3 for all nations that's rather sad have drunk of the wine of the WTH of a fornication so Babylon is controlling the world the\n\n(04:29) religious system is controlling the world so the Nations have drunk it and the kings of the earth that's the rulers have committed fornication with her in other words they're working together with the religious structures and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies so what have\n\n(04:51) the merchants got to do with this this is fascinating stuff so the nations are subject to Babylon the kings are subject to Babylon you me to tell me the merchants are also subject to Babylon isn't this interesting well today if you aren't one of the Insiders H you will have problems coping in this world Heavenly\n\n(05:16) song number two Revelation 18:4 and I heard another voice from Heaven you see there's a second voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people this is a very important message that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God has\n\n(05:42) remembered her iniquities so this is a message of separation and God is calling a people out of Babylon that means he's calling people out of systems of false worship serious business and we can reject it or we could do it it's very hard to change it's very hard to come out of one system and to acknowledge\n\n(06:11) that we were in error it was very hard for me to come out of my system very hard but I had no choice or else I would sit in Babylon and the Bible says come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins her have reached unto heaven and\n\n(06:36) God has remembered her iniquities so there are going to be some consequences to these actions Isaiah 21:9 says and behold here cometh The Chariot of men with a couple of Horsemen and he answered and said Babylon is Fallen is fallen and all the graven images of our Gods he has broken unto the ground that\n\n(06:57) was the typical message there is going to be an anti-typical message which will be worldwide Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take bomb for a pain if so be she may be healed now listen to this sad note Jeremiah 518 and9 we would have healed Babylon but she is not healed she will\n\n(07:24) not listen she will not repent and change her ways and come back into harmony with God therefore what does it say forsake her and let us go everyone unto his own country for her judgment reaches unto heaven and is lifted up unto the skies Jeremiah 51 8-9 as it was then so it will be at the end Revelation 18:6 says reward her even\n\n(07:51) as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she has filled f to her double she has poured out false doctrines she has exalted self instead of exalting God and she will have to face the consequences because people on this planet will be lost because of her how much she has glorified herself\n\n(08:17) you see that and live deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her how much torment and sorrow has she dished out over the years we've had all these lectures we've seen what they've done it is an horrendous story it's an unbelievable story that we gave peace by Peace by peace because if we had given\n\n(08:38) it all you would have all run away and you would have said this is insanity would you not have done so I'm sure you would have and she has said in her heart I sit as Queen and I am not a widow and I shall not seee sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she will be\n\n(09:04) utterly burned with fire for strong is the Lord God who judges her the Babylonian system which has permeated the whole of the religious world today is going to be destroyed by God by fire Leviticus 21:9 and the daughter of any priest if she profane herself by playing the whall she profane her father\n\n(09:31) she shall be burnt with fire not by stoning by fire so that'll be the end so it's better to come out of her than to stay in her very very very tough call this is a loud cry two selected messages I think I may quote that now because we've had a lecture on this and let's see what the message entails thus the substance of the second Angel's\n\n(10:02) message is again given to the world remember Babylon is Fallen Babylon is Fallen by that other Angel who lightens the Earth with his glory these messages that's the Three Angels messages worship God give glory to him the hour of his judgment has come Babylon is Fallen Babylon is Fallen do not accept the mark of the beast these\n\n(10:25) messages all blend into one to come before the people in the the closing days of this Earth's history all the world will be tested and all that have been in the darkness of era in regard to the Sabbath of the fourth Commandment will understand the last message of Mercy that is to be given to men remember that the Sabbath is just the\n\n(10:46) Seal of authority to the entire law of God so in a sense it stands out not because of the day but because of the authority that it gives to the entire law of God there were two Temple cleansings two calls out of Babylon when Jesus began his public Ministry he cleansed the temple from its sacrilegious profanation beautiful\n\n(11:14) parallels here among the last acts of his ministry was the second cleansing of the temple so in the last work for the warning of the world two distinct calls are made to the churches the second Angel's message is Babylon is Fallen is Fallen that great City because she made all the nations drink of the wine of the\n\n(11:32) WTH of her fornication and in the loud Cry of the third Angel's message a voice is heard from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquities that makes sense there were\n\n(11:57) two cleansings of the Temple there are two callings out out of apostasy to the truth now what are these sins for her sins have reached unto Heaven how do you give a message like this you get up there and say Babylon has sinned no you have to say what it means so here's another quote called to expose the man\n\n(12:23) of sin in the very time in which we live the Lord has called his people and has given them a message to bear he has called them to expose the wickedness of the man of sin who has made Sunday law distinctive power and who has thought to change times and laws and to oppress the people of God who stand firmly to honor\n\n(12:43) him that's very interesting did we have some lectures here discussing how the law of God was changed and did we look at what happened in history and how the Jesuits worked behind the scenes to control every aspect of humanity yes so we exposed some of this wickedness and how political systems were going to be controlled by this\n\n(13:15) power in fact it goes further in four manuscripts released she writes people are to be shown what they might expect from the papal power and the time has come when the Protestant churches are reaching out to grasp the hand of the power that has made void the law of God is that so is that happening did they do it are they\n\n(13:40) in The ecumenical movement reaching over and saying you are our spiritual leader yes so the people are to be shown what they may expect from the papal power did we do that in these lectures frighteningly so unfortunately it's not an easy message message to give it's actually even a dangerous message to\n\n(14:02) give in the times we live in but that was a necessary message we are to give the message Babylon the great is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and every Etc come out of them my people this message is to come to the churches and the message must be so presented as to command the attention of\n\n(14:24) reasoning minds it mustn't be just a load of emotional stuff it must be a logical message I hope we have succeeded a little bit in that it is a huge task the message of the fall of Babylon as given by the second Angel is repeated now this is very interesting let's start from the beginning about this Mighty\n\n(14:49) angel in Revelation chapter 18 that descends to Earth to unite his voice with the third Angel great power and Glory were imparted to the the angel and as he descended the Earth was lighted with his glory the light which attended this Angel penetrated everywhere as he cried mightily with a strong voice\n\n(15:09) Babylon the greatest Fallen has become a cage of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird what does that mean well here it says the message of the fall of Babylon as given by the second Angel is repeated that's correct we can see that with the additional mention of the Corruptions which have been\n\n(15:32) entering the churches since 1844 wow that's fascinating stuff so in other words when the message was first proclaimed early on it wasn't clear what it really meant it just meant Babylon is Fallen because they have false Doctrine but how deep does the rot go is part of the other angel in other words what this Angel has to do he has to not\n\n(16:04) only say Babylon you are Fallen but he must say you have become a house of demons and of every unclean bird and how do you do that you have to reveal the Corruptions which have been entering the churches since 1844 and how the Church of England has officially called for seances in the church how can you allow that if you are\n\n(16:30) a servant of the Gospel so these things are bad they are bad and they are designed so that people should recognize what's going on in the world out there how they have left Jesus Christ behind and accepted another gospel so here's another one in the great controversy with the additional mention of the corruption which have\n\n(16:56) been entered the various organizations that constitute Babylon so there's a huge huge organization here that is everything that's under control on in Babylon in other words it's a monstrous task who controls Babylon behind the scenes we had a look at it we looked and we saw that it was who the Jesuit order\n\n(17:19) working stealth F behind the scenes to further the aims of Rome then we had to look at the organizations and what their teachings were and we saw wow it's not only that but there are secret societies like Skull and Bones Nights of Columbus Opus day etc etc etc and we looked at what they taught and what they actually stood\n\n(17:45) for scary then we looked at the great body that they brought together in order to unite the world politically and we see spiritually at well and that was the United Nations and we used their quot quotes to see what they were actually saying all of these organizations we went through them one by one and we saw what has been happening\n\n(18:10) over there of Babylon her sins have been reached unto heaven and God has remembered her iniquity she has lifted up the measure of her guilt and destruction is about to fall on know so announcing the sins of Babylon these announcements you nting with a third Angel's message constitute the final warning to be given to the\n\n(18:34) inhabitants of the earth well if this is true if this is true then I think that's what you've just been hearing in the last few weeks that's kind of scary and I want to almost guarantee you that it's never been done before like this I would almost like to guarantee that it's been bits in pieces but this is interesting\n\n(18:59) how must we go about this our Warfare is aggressive let nothing lessen the force force of the truth for this time the third Angel's message must do the work of separating from the churches a people who will take their stands on the platform of Eternal truth these are thunderous things I heard those clothed\n\n(19:17) with the armor speak forth the truth with great power it had effect many had been bound some wives by their husbands some children by their parents the honest had been prevented from hearing the truth now eagerly laid hold upon it all fear of their relatives was gone and the truth alone was exalted to them they\n\n(19:41) had been hungering and thirsting for truth it was dearer and more precious than life I asked what had made the great change an angel answered it is the latter rain the refreshing from the presence of the Lord the loud Cry of the third angel the loud Cry of the third Angel is the latter rain that's very interesting what's the\n\n(20:07) latter R about Joel 2:1 and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army for his Camp is very great for he is strong that executed his word for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible who can abide it can you see this serious business this is not a joke therefore also now says the Lord turn you even to me with all your hearts\n\n(20:33) with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and Rend your heart and not your garments no good having an outer display of religion there must be a change in here and turn unto the Lord your God for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil what a\n\n(20:54) wonderful God he's had so many thousands of years of tears and patience and longsuffering with a people that never want to listen to him nothing has changed over history who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the Lord your\n\n(21:17) God blow the trumpet in Zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children those who suck at the breast let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber that's Jesus coming again and the bride out of her closet that's his people waiting to be United with him\n\n(21:40) let the priests the Ministers of the Lord weep between the porch and the Altar and let them say spare thy people oh Lord and give not thine Heritage to reproach that the Heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their God God's people will have to be on their knees this is a serious\n\n(22:03) time Jeremiah 30:7 says alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of Jacob's trouble but he shall be saved out of it wrestling with God and saying Lord am I doing the right thing am I in line with your word hoseah 6:3 then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going\n\n(22:25) forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us us as the rain as the latter and former Reign unto the Earth God started his ministry with the former Reign God will end his ministry with the latter rain and the latter rain is the loud cry in other words people screaming to the world why do you want to die come out of\n\n(22:54) sin come accept truth you see it's not a selfish something it is something for salvation jol Joel 2:23 be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month there was a\n\n(23:20) typology there that was fulfilling a greater spiritual truth Zechariah 10:1 ask ye the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone gross in the field we have to ask for it ask the Lord to help us to make the best plans to spread the\n\n(23:44) truth and to change inside Ephesians 4 13 and 15 till we come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the the fullness of Christ but speaking the truth in love may grow up in Him in all things which is the head even Christ\n\n(24:08) it's a very hard message you have become a house of demons and a house of every unclean and detestable bird and you have to say it in love with a tear in the eye difficult to do Jesus has shed many tears in this way for us Hebrews 12:26 didn't he shed tears when he said Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I wanted\n\n(24:36) to gather you like a mother hen her chicks but you would not and now your house has been left to you desolate he saw the destruction of Jerusalem he did it with tears he wanted to but they would not listen some did Hebrews 12:26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I\n\n(25:07) shake not the Earth only but also Heaven nemiah 5:13 also I shook my lap and said so God shake out every man from what's it say there his house and from his labor that performeth not this promise even thus he be shaken out and empty te and all the congregation said amen and praise the Lord and the people did according to the\n\n(25:35) promise job 15:33 he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flowers as the olive so the loud cry is not just for the world but it's for the personal heart and we have to decide do we want to be ripe grapes or do we want to remain unripe grapes do we want to grow into the stature and fullness of Christ\n\n(26:01) or do we want to keep a little bit to ourselves that's the question so the loud cry is a message to the outside world warning them to come out of Babylon and to make a stand for righteousness and truth based on the Bible and the Bible and alone and the loud cry is a message to the heart saying no half religion is good enough\n\n(26:29) anymore either I'm all for Christ or I'm all against him there can be no lukewarmness one or the other it's a very serious message I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen and was shown that it would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of the true witness to the louded sins so\n\n(26:54) the louded sins have to be told louded sin you're cold wretched blind naked by I solve so that you can see and purchase gold refined in the fire that's the fire of Affliction that is to change the heart to change the mind this will have its effect upon the heart of the receiver and will lead to exalt the\n\n(27:20) standard and pour forth straight truth some will take it some will leave it so don't think think that because you are in a denomination that preaches the truth that that means you are going to be saved nobody's saved by his birth nobody is saved by the dress he wears or what school he attends you're saved by\n\n(27:45) your relationship with Jesus Christ and if you have a relationship with Jesus Christ is there anything to fear no because job said even if he slay me yet will I trust him and that's the relationship we have to have we can't have a half measure relationship you have to have an experience you have to have oil you must\n\n(28:07) have walked the road so that you know that this is someone you can trust song three so those were the two Heavenly warnings serious warnings and then the Earthly warnings what do you think the Earthly warnings are going to be are they going to be joyful no those who stay Earthly are not not going to be joyful Revelation 189\n\n(28:30) and the kings of the earth who had committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her why because of their loss not because they wanted to repent oh no this is sorrow that leads to death sorrow for loss rather than Godly sorrow which leads to repentance which is\n\n(28:58) recognizing your own problem and changing and when they shall see the smoke of her burning cuz God is going to destroy Babylon standing AAR off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great City Babylon that Mighty City for in one hour is thy judgment come there are the kings of the world today and all of them Wonder after the\n\n(29:23) beasts all of them they're not looking at the Bible that doing what a system says and so you have the Goofs and the popes and you have the leas and you have the castros and you have the queens and the Kings and the princes and whether they are Islam or whether they are United States of America all the kings wondered after the\n\n(29:50) Beast and all of them are eating dead bread that's what it is dead bread Jesus said do this in memory of me till I come we serve a living Christ a risen Christ these are all the politicians of the world and they all live at the same Fountain there's Nelson Mandela receiving the same and isn't it sad\n\n(30:22) they're all listening to the system and giving a public display of obedience to a worldly system the kings of the world will whail whether we like them or whether they have done great things is not the Criterion and I would love to sit down and talk with Nelson Mandela I would love to sit down and talk to\n\n(30:47) him I'm not condemning him the whole world is in confusion and living in a lie if only he could understand if only the president of the United States could understand maybe they could repent and change here he is speaking at the United Nations Pope John Paul 2 and he said now get on with it make me a new world order\n\n(31:15) that's what we need on this planet well maybe you'll get your new world order but it's not God's order it's not God's order Pope calls for a new world order CNN his whole new year's speech and whether it's Putin or whether it is Bush who cares they're all under the same roof do you see that the kings of the\n\n(31:38) world are going to wail when Babylon goes yes or no yes they're going to wail song four is another Earthly one and the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buy their merchandise anymore who control controls the merchant world and the banking world we had lectures on it do you\n\n(32:04) remember whole lectures and we saw that in control of all of these are the secret societies yes Skull and Bones controls at the upper level masonry controls at the lower levels everything is controlled and the merchants of the world cannot move without saying yay or nay to the power of the Beast you try and open a store in a mall\n\n(32:37) and tell the mall that you'll be closed on a Sabbath day will you get a store no you won't you can close on a Sunday but you can't close on a Saturday you have to obey the Beast and more and more you'll have to obey the beast in order to be a merchant have you noticed how the little man is being being squeezed out of the\n\n(32:59) worlds and how the mega companies have come together and are controlling everything and soon you will not be able to buy or sell L you are part of the system and those who are part of the system are cashing in they don't mind they don't mind so the merchants of the Earth shall weep and mourn over her for\n\n(33:21) no man buth their merchandise anymore the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and Scarlet and th and wood and many things Ivory and vessels and most precious wood and brass and iron and marble and new name it and cinnamon and oders and ointments\n\n(33:40) and frankincense and wine and oil and flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and Souls of men whoa whoa what was that they control everything even The Souls of men and slaves is there a Slave trade in the world today bigger than you might imagine and the sex slave slave trade in\n\n(34:04) the world is not going unnoticed by the eye of God what happens behind the scene is so horrendous it's not worthy of mention in the circle and they work with the souls of men and the fruits that thy Soul lusted after after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from the\n\n(34:27) the and thou shalt find them no more at all is there going to be an economic collapse yes because Babylon is going to collapse Revelation 18:15 the merchants of these things which were made Rich by her shall stand AAR off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and saying alas alas that great city that\n\n(34:53) was clothed in fine linen and purple and Scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls for in one hour so great riches is come to nots wow so the whole system of the Economy based on the secret societies is going to collapse here's another song number five Revelation 1870 and every ship master and all the\n\n(35:25) company in ships and sailers and as many as trade by sea stood AAR off can you see that what do they do by sea traed and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great City and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great\n\n(35:47) City wherein were made this is this Earthly song were made Rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour she made desolate look at Psalms 48:7 thou breakast the ships of tarish with an East Wind Psalms 104:26 there there go the ships there is that leviatan Satan whom thou Hast made to\n\n(36:18) play therein Psalms 10723 they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in Great Waters hm the economic world is not run by whom you think it is run if you want to be a mega company you better be on the side of the Beast or not be at all that is the sad fact World business facing up to transformation interesting\n\n(36:50) symbols and signs Satan uses influence of mind and upon mind cast out the of Heaven Satan set up his kingdom in this world and ever since he has been untiringly striving to seduce human beings from their allegiance to God he uses the same power that he used in heaven the influence of mind on mind men\n\n(37:12) become tempters of their fellow men the strong corrupting Sentiments of Satan are cherished and they exer exert a masterly compelling power and the influence of these s sentiments men bind up with one another in confederacies in trade unions in secret societies there are at work in the world agencies that\n\n(37:34) God will not much longer tolerate the trade unions will be the cause of the most terrible violence that has ever been seen amongst human beings do you think this is going to come true I believe so I've stood on the other side of the trade unions I've had them storm me with police all around I've had them break my ribs I've stood\n\n(38:01) in the Senate building of the University with a Trade union and its followers all around smashing the building until all the glass shattered and the whole building came down like rain with murder in their eyes Amazing Stories I could tell you stories about trade unions which are just the tip of the iceberg of what is\n\n(38:24) going to come imagine what will happen when the econ starts collapsing can you imagine the violence and the anger in the world Sun worship there is a round red dis Adoration of the celestial cow Sun worship Sun worship is Sun worship occult worship Babylonian worship part of the system of Babylon as we continue with this\n\n(38:53) question of sun worship the red disc was a symb symbol of the solar deity actually it then represents set the god of the underworld the god or sep at least the god of death if you look here IHS Isis Horus sep you'll see sep was always depicted with a red dis and SE according to occultist is Satan Lucifer if you look at various sun\n\n(39:22) symbols these are the ones that are very common in the world today and you will notice uh Ying yangs if you like triple Ying yangs or mitom over there in fours in squares and all of these interesting sun symbols here is the Big Red Dot the holy dot or bind also known as kung kung whatever tilak and by other names is an\n\n(39:48) Asal makeup worn by young Hindu girls and women on their forehead the term is derived from Bindu and the Sanskrit word for a DOT or a point considered the Blessed symbol of Uma or Parvati aindi signifies female energy or Shakti let's go and find a little bit further what this means here's the encyclopedic\n\n(40:09) dictionary of yoga it informs us that this chakra is also called the third eye the center is connected with the sacred syllable om and presiding it is par Shiva who was Shiva do you remember what platski said who Shiva was it was Satan it was Lucifer after activation of the center the aspirant overcomes amaka ego or sense of\n\n(40:35) individuality the last hurdle on the path to spirituality what did it the um United Nations say we will have to give up what our individuality do you know that you were created a free agent by God and Satan requires you to give that up no thank you we are children of the most high we will not give up our\n\n(40:59) individuality and what is this dot the dot Sun Microsoft systems just beneath the surface of your business is the most powerful force in the universe this is a normal advertisement do they have a hidden agenda the dot with DOT Inc do com you know no boundaries and your competition knows never to enter your\n\n(41:25) Waters they divided up nicely all the franchises going to different places nobody is competition everybody makes money the dot turns information into power the power is everywhere and it's always on thanks to pher ferocious internet Computing tools the ultra available Enterprise seres such and such Solaris docomo mean sun it's called Sun\n\n(41:54) Microsoft and it has a masonic Square these people I think that they know what they're dealing with I think they know what they're dealing with well there's some dots for you Red Dot girls the Elder lesbian initiative Red Dot Building Systems I'm not saying everybody that uses the Red Dot is necessarily one of them but it's one of\n\n(42:12) the symbols that is used Mega companies Mega mergers are these people for real are they hiding something perhaps you know Reserve Bank powerless to hold Banks to governments what are these Mega emerges did you know that these are ult symbols yes they are and that in the original writings of these companies\n\n(42:34) they are listed as such yes very interesting so who was Chrysler and who were all these people and why is that a pentagon and a pentagram all in one well there's Chrysler this is a picture I took from a Scottish right calendar given out by Scottish right Freemasonry where Chrysler is listed as a 33 degree\n\n(43:01) Freemason whether we like it or whether we don't all these Mega companies political organizations Ford what about Ford or Volkswagen or any one of those here's Volkswagen and you can see they have this little advertisement here the Wall Street so and so and there are the numbers combination for the lock is 666\n\n(43:22) 666 chance could be could be chance who are they cooperating with Ford Motor Company there you see the same symbol AS Volkswagen on the papal choir this comes from the same Masonic calendar there Ford is listed as a 33Â° Freemason so we don't have to look too far there is their advertisement they use the same 666 in their advertisement\n\n(43:50) they even call it hell 666 they don't even worry about this guy sitting in the front there isn't that interesting or what about this red dot what about that red dot that is used over here this Mega company is called Coke what is Coke it's a shortcut for cocaine you see Coke is made from the extract of the cocaine plant under the\n\n(44:21) drug laws they must now extract all cocaine from it but original maybe they weren't so fussy right how do you get a drink to be the biggest drink in the world and there's so much caffeine in it that it's obviously addicted and Christina anasis died from an overlo dose of coke by the way these are the mega companies this is the\n\n(44:44) company that made Santa Claus famous Santa that's just a scrambling of an interesting name what about that red dots do these company companies control things why two of them merging has it to do with the merging of the male female aspect the Red Dot and the yellow dot why all these dots and dots and what is this here\n\n(45:08) loosen technology a serpent with a tail in the mouth a round circle with a tail in the mouth what's that dot doing there in the cigarette company or why use double s's when that is an occult symbol or that red dot if you like or that e what is the East stand for interesting symbolism all of these companies using\n\n(45:32) these circles representing um serpents with a tail in the mouth or symbols of shamash or you name it all the mega companies the O in Mobile for example is a red circle which has an occult meaning the original symbol of mobile was Pegasus Pegasus is the god of death and uh pentagrams shells the Coptic versions or the\n\n(45:59) deities used to come out of the shell there the great banking companies the strange combinations of animals there's an interesting Eastern logo that one over there used by some of the mega companies that's just interesting stuff Alpha Romeo uses a serpent swallowing Man actually when you think about it why\n\n(46:21) have a serpent swallowing man isn't that interesting or this one over here used by this Motor Company it's the symbol of the bull cult we could go on and on and on it's not really important I mean symbolism is not important it really is a joke or this one over here that's a very interesting one it's the same as loosen\n\n(46:40) technology loose loosen technology this company over here s Circle and it's also actually the serpent with the tail in the mouth but written so neatly that the inside makes a six is's all this chants well if you don't read the book by Kathy Burns on Masonic symbols you will see that many of them explain exactly where they get\n\n(47:05) their symbols from and they are occult and they say so themselves you have 13s hidden in them Bell you have so many Bells Bell this Bell that Bell the other bell bell bell bell bell who is Bell it was a god Bell but here's an interesting one I've shown this to you before but I want to point out something\n\n(47:29) else this was the official website of the Church of Satan and initially there was a company logo that seemed to be a sponsor for this can you see it down there can you see it on there that's very interesting that's taken direct from their official web page well they n denied it like crazy but it was there\n\n(47:53) it's taken off now but uh here is another massive franchise what is all this symbolism double-headed Eagles and all these symbols and then this thing over here with a wedge of the eye in the eye of Lucifer this I took from the Fort Worth Masonic Lodge there's the same symbol there it is just the other way around\n\n(48:14) are these franchises controlled by someone what about this one over here very famous thing I wear them I I don't care they make nice trousers they make nice shoes I don't care I have to walk it's always nice you know occasionally you can give an extra stamp well Nike they know exactly who that is they say that it is the goddess\n\n(48:36) the spirit of Nike the goddess they know who they're dealing with or what about all these Mega companies do they have to have the dou S built in do they have to have it or do they have to give Masonic handshakes when they hand out their little medals to each other little awards for great work do you know this\n\n(48:58) card this is the cash card in uh Africa we use these you take this card and you go and you pay anything from a parking meter to whatever you want to pay you can put as much money on it as you like it's cash wherever you go you just go swipe and it's cash and when it's empty it's empty you go back to the bank you swipe it and\n\n(49:19) you fill it up you can fill it at the up at the supermarket just punch in your bank number swipe it through and you got money again it's an interesting card what hases it got on it it's got all these symbols on Mitsubishi loses the same symbols they are symbols of uh Pagan deities it has the allseeing eye\n\n(49:38) on it it even has a coin on it with a face on it now I don't know whether you can recognize that face but I can whose face is it it's Pope John Paul 2 yes interesting I wonder who controls the world's cash what about the world entertainment media these are the mega stars of the world what's he doing here showing off Masonic\n\n(50:02) ritual you remember who he is don't you he played in the Titanic he was the main star okay and uh let's just have a look at this what they showed on one television station there is nothing wrong with your television do not attempt to adjust the picture we we are now controlling the transmission we control the horizontal\n\n(50:31) and the vertical we can delude you with a thousand channels or expand one single image to Crystal Clarity and Beyond we can shape your vision to anything our imagination can conceive for the next hour we will control all that you see and hear [Music] that's just the introduction to a program we control everything you see\n\n(51:03) everything you do and one satanic symbol after the other appears but that's nothing compared to what you can see on televisions I mean wow the evil that's out there is tremendous who controls these Mega societies who controls the entertainment World well these are the mega companies what are they using what\n\n(51:23) are CBS uses uses the allseeing eye of Lucifer what's colia use uses the Masonic triangle plus the goddess yes that's basically the one carrying the flame that's Lucifer with a sun symbol behind her or this one over here using the half moon or this one over here using a masonic Shield or using uh Masonic triangles these are sacred\n\n(51:52) mountains that are used in the worship particularly in IC countries or this company over here again using the top of the Masonic triangle with the female deity the female form of Lucifer and using Pegasus the god of death as their symbol this one over here he uses the peacock symbol of Lucifer this one over\n\n(52:17) here is so full of masonic uh symbolism we won't even bother with it all of them are involved in one way or another Sony uses the Masonic triangle you name it who controls them we've looked at the sporting World same symbols and then there's another song Rejoice over her song six Rejoice over her thou heaven and ye Holy\n\n(52:48) Apostles and the prophets for God has Avenged Avenged you on her and a mighty Angel took up a stone like a great mil Stone and cast it into the sea saying thus will with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all okay this is a Heavenly song and it's declaring the\n\n(53:15) destruction of Babylon Babylon to be thrown down and shall be found no more at all Revelation 18:22 in the voice of the Harpers and the mus Ians and the Pipers and the trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee no Craftsman of whatever craft shall be he be shall be found anymore in thee and the sound of a\n\n(53:39) millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee verse 23 and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the Bride shall be heard no more that's what they do marry and give into marriage all in thee for thy Merchants were the Great Men of of the Earth for\n\n(53:58) by their sorceries were all nations deceived and in her was found the blood of the prophets and of the Saints and of those that were slain upon the Earth don't think this system has been good how many people have the molinis of this world slaughtered unbelievable countless Millions and how many people have not died in the\n\n(54:30) business world with corrupt dealings unbelievable but notice this one over here this music Hoppers musicians Pipers trumpeters shall be heard no more no more what about the world of music you know who that is Vol gang amadeos Moz what was he he was a high Freemason Daniel 3 1-6 Nebuchadnezzar the king\n\n(55:01) made an image of gold whose height was 60 cubits and its breaths six cubits then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satrs the prefects the governors the councelors the treasures the Justice the justices all officials of all the provinces come to the dedication of the images did he leave anyone\n\n(55:18) out no he had a long list as who had to bow down everybody then a Herold cried aloud to you it is commanded o people Nations and languages wow it sounds just like Revelation at the time you hear the sound of the horn the pipe the sitter the liar The Hop the bagpipe all kinds of music you shall fall down and worship\n\n(55:40) the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the King has set up now we've looked at how this worship is in the churches already so I'm not even going to show you that but Babylon is more than just the churches you oh King have made a decree that every man who shall hear the sound of the horn the pipe the sit of the LIE\n\n(55:58) The Hop the bag pip all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoever does not fall down and worship he should be thrown into the midst of the burning fiery furnace Daniel 310 and 11 so music will play a tremendous role in the final confusions FL the magic flut do you know this beautiful piece of work well who\n\n(56:26) was it dedicated to him it was dedicated to Isis and Osiris and seeing that I don't have a clip maybe I even have to sing it to you and chase you all away but it said to isus anybody know that OED to Isis and Osiris I'm not going to sing it I don't want to make you suffer that much you're suffering enough already but that was\n\n(56:53) what it was that was the stage you had the the half moon with the deity in it the queen in it that is occultism the the set was Egyptian with all the ancient figures listen to what this uh knowledgeable fellow on this subject has to say listen carefully it's a very short clip great music is such a beautiful\n\n(57:17) thing oh it's really it's amazing I love seeing like all different cultures just did together bobing the head we just mov to the music no segregation that's it's music is the one thing they can cross over all boundaries oh yeah that's a language that's a complete language all right first thing he said\n\n(57:33) was oh yes it's a religion music is a religion and it is a language it crosses all boundaries all barriers that's what he says he should know one big party the house scene and today thousands and thousands no millions are duped into this type of activity and where does it start it starts with the heart of Babylonian\n\n(58:06) worship this man is Alistar a Crowley and the Beatles even had a song dedicated to him alist the crowly do you remember that yes they loved him and so does the entire Rock world love aliser Crowley he was a interesting man let's see see what he wrote this is alist Crowley saying I have feasted myself on\n\n(58:30) the blood of saints but I am not suspected of men to be their enemy for my fleece is white and warm for my teeth are not the teeth of one who tears and my eyes are mild and they know me not as the chief of the lying Spirits beautiful art thou oh Babylon Babylon thou Mighty mother that ride upon the crown Beast\n\n(58:51) let me be drunken upon the wine of your fornication and let your kisses want me to death ooo I think he was on the other side what do you think this is wickedness in high places do you think these people are just deceived or do they know what they are doing they know what they're doing so he was a wicked wicked\n\n(59:17) luciferian well here are the big bands today rush and all of these he has a band and up there is in their album this dark picture over there where you can see nothing try and highlight it a little bit and you'll see there's actually a man looking down there I don't know whether you can see that but that is none other than Anton La founder\n\n(59:41) of

cat with its tail in a vice right come on all kinds of music so Anastasia can sing like that or she\n\n(1:01:33) could sing like this depends on the mood [Music] [Applause] right totally different mood all right we don't have to go into all the details of what she sings you think this is chance this particular thing over here or looking over the rims of the glasses if you think that's chance is the an on her music labels and the sun symbols are\n\n(1:02:11) they chants and why do all these birds of a feather flock together do you think that all kinds of music might be interesting mother of

rave party he was curious enough to overcome his dislike of the music until his face lit up with a revelation this is medit he shouted above the noise later explained that the walking meditation he taught\n\n(1:05:31) involves being fully aware of the moment without any internal dialogue separating actions from intentions etc etc so this was something spiritual so what happens at a rave some of the symbolism diss Eagle's Wings Man Without stretched arms Divine deity what about this this was a beautiful m movie they\n\n(1:05:56) say there was a beautiful song the Titanic given here with a

believe the heart do go I believe that the heart goes on and on we don't have to listen to more what the lyrics say the lyrics are spiritism the music is bewitching isn't it the melody gets burnt into your head is this part of Babylon or is it not unfortunately yes because it prints messages what about drugs on the Rave\n\n(1:07:50) scene yeah this is a very famous DJ affair J DJ with all the occult symbols that you can imagine and uh symbols of samash in there and these are the pills that you can get hold of the drug pulls with all the symbols on them every single symbol you can think of Alice D is the most popular drug in the\n\n(1:08:15) goatrance scene and there you can see these little squares each of them represents a trip so here you have all these symbols and please note that you have Ganesha over there that's the god of Eastern mysticism even these uh funny little cartoons that they use and the football those are all actually occult symbols and each little square\n\n(1:08:42) has enough LSD that if you put it under your tongue then you can get a trip no here has an invitation to a rave to our friends we haven't met welcome to the house of Rush where nasty music and wicked people become one DJs so and so and so and so so and so and so and so no illegal substances no weapons hello they call\n\n(1:09:07) themselves rush rush is the trip you go on when you have a trip on LISD and why is there invitation in little LISD squares doesn't that tell the inside a crowd there will be drugs there if you take ecstasy you go into an altered state of consciousness and you open your mind to another Spirit now let's turn\n\n(1:09:29) the sound right down on this one cu the sound is bad this is Jay-Z Knight The Great Channel and she is running a seminar and she is going to Now train totally normal people how to come into contact with the spirit world the video is not very good and there they start clapping and praying and doing all their\n\n(1:09:51) things together but now she's informing them that but in order to make a channel for the spirit to come in you have to go a little bit further it's not enough to clap and have rhythm you now have to open a channel and what you need to do is you need to take something to lighten up alcohol so let's bring in some alcohol\n\n(1:10:18) and let's start our Mystic session with alcohol so some of these people have never had wine wine in their lives now they have to drink wine because it makes it easier for the spirit to come in and they start drinking their wine once you have started drinking the wine well you need something more to make it a little\n\n(1:10:40) bit more pizzazzy this lady says I've never had anything to drink in my life this was my first experience what a spiritual upliftment when we could drink together and ask for the spirit to take control these are normal people can you believe it and they fall for this rubbish and now she's going to demonstrate how we\n\n(1:11:03) can improve the spirit's activity instead of just wine what else can we use let's see what she does oh the wine looks good oh let's light up a pipe let's start smoking well these are the introductory stages where does it go to then then it goes to drug and if you're a rer that's what you're on you're actually opening up for an\n\n(1:11:30) altered state of consciousness and Goa head and all these Raves what fascinates me in the is the r r culture is purely hedonistic it is frequently regarded as a spiritual event that's very interesting and they celebrate their unity and shared uplifted state to stretch the religious met metaphor DJs of the high priest of the Rave ceremony\n\n(1:11:58) so it is actually a religious event Goa is a paradise on the shores of India a place where hippies and travelers have retired or retreated since the 60s goatrance is best described as a psychedelic dance music in Goa the main dance drug is ald needless to say the music is composers take full advantage\n\n(1:12:20) of this weaving in syn 303 analog noises and a powerful C oscope of sounds the beat is a steady 44 kick but is often hidden deep within the twirling array so this is actually music if we can have the sound up again I'm not going to play much of this but notice how it builds [Music] up and gets higher and higher\n\n(1:12:53) [Music] come down from the violent skies and then she says I come down from violent Skies I'm about to reveal the tales of your life I'm about to reveal the tales of your life too many Secrets oh it's pure spiritism the song but the ravers don't even notice it because they're high and they're being imprinted with something in their heads\n\n(1:13:24) so what what is actually happening in this music industry this is a band called Black Sabbath well it's an old band Yes these were uh Sabbath Keepers once Sabbath Keepers you know if you empty out the house and you clean it out seven demons worse than before come back have you watched Aussie Osborne on television\n\n(1:13:47) have you watched him in that famous television show where they film him in his house and everything he does he's got the foulest mouth under the sun spiced out nothing left of him is that what you get from drugs really not worth it this man over here notice that he has a witch's coven down there and this man also used to be\n\n(1:14:09) a Sabbath keeper and his family are Sabbath Keepers and he sings a very interesting song and he's a world famous let's listen to his song and see what he has to say it's [Music] Prince all seven and we'll watch them all sevens and we'll watch them fall the way of love and we will smoke them they stand in the way of love and\n\n(1:14:33) we and no one in the whole universe will ever comp I now and you are mine and together love through all space and time so don't cry one day on seven will die then come some demonic noises what's he saying he's saying something about the sevens they think they are so great they think they know it all well I'm yours\n\n(1:15:14) now and you are mine and together we'll love through space and time and one day all sevens will die what's he saying he is speaking with a Babylonian prophetic tongue I have news for you Prince read Revelation and you will see God will not let them die although you might think so well let's go a little\n\n(1:15:38) bit deeper this is a very famous man caros sentana he's speaking in Rolling Stone magazine and he's saying in my meditations this entity called Metatron said we want to hook you back to the radio Airway frequency to reach junior high schools high schools and universities once you reach them we want you to present them with a new form of\n\n(1:16:02) existence people are going crazy with Latin frenzy and Spanish frenzy but it's really African music that Ricky Martin is playing and Jennifer Lopez is playing and I am playing right so he wants a new form of existence he wants a new religion printed into their minds and who's telling him this an entity that he\n\n(1:16:22) speaks to called Metatron who's Metatron well let's go to the highest Masonic book morals and dogma and ask them who Metatron is the 28 degree of Scottish Freemasonry is subject to Metatron and salaon now who are they quote morals and Dogma Albert Pike the pass word of the degree is given as metalon which is a Corruption of\n\n(1:16:50) Metatron the Cherub who and Sal Doon are in the kalala the chief of the Angels the active and passive symbols are the male and female so who's Metatron it's Satan who is sandalon it's the female aspect of Satan one and the same thing so who is Santana speaking to he's speaking to the devil and he's using a genuine occult name\n\n(1:17:23) these people are occultists and they are work working for Babylon the follower of voodo seeks to incorporate a la a Lesser God and the Rhythm lets him be taken over the African drum is considered sacred they are washed put to rest worshiped as deities and the drums are the ears of the Gods interesting look at the\n\n(1:17:45) blasphemy here pretending to be uh bleeding at the hands and feet what about Hip Hop hip hop is the Rhythm that can bring about an altered state of consciousness without the drums same thing Joshua heard the voice of the people in the shouting and he said to Moses Exodus 32 a sound of war is in the camp and he said it's not a sound of Cry\n\n(1:18:10) of Victory or a sound of Cry of defeat I'm hearing the sound of singing and when Moses saw that the people were naked uninhibited for Aaron had made them naked uninhibited to their sh amongst their enemies well they were using music and we can use music for good or we can use it for bad we can be moved by the spirit\n\n(1:18:37) here is a rage of D sa can you believe that this was a rage in a charismatic church with a full catastrophe and it makes no difference whether this music is in the church or whether it is used by the Devil Himself out there where have we come to and the pope goes Rock the name of God well song 7 Revelation 191 and after\n\n(1:19:05) these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven the final Heavenly voice saying Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God we are living in a time that calls for decided action the world is more bitterly opposed than ever to gospel ref form it sure is are we\n\n(1:19:27) surprised when God is going to end the system how many young people today have been destroyed by drugs how many people absolute horrendous when you see what is happening to the young people and guess which countries are most subject to drugs the Protestant countries the Protestant countries is there a method\n\n(1:19:54) in Madness perhaps just asking just asking the world is more bitterly opposed than ever to gospel reform but not withstanding this God's work is to go forward the words of Christ came down to us who are living at the close of Earth's history when these things shall begin to come to pass then look up and\n\n(1:20:14) lift up your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh the nations are in unrest times of perplexity are Upon Us men's hearts are failing them for fear of the things that are coming upon the Earth but those who believe in God will hear his voice amid the storm saying it is I Be not Afraid the world is lying in\n\n(1:20:34) wickedness and apostasy Rebellion to God's law seems almost Universal but admit the tumult of excitement with confusion in every place there is a work to be done for God in the world people young people always ask me is this still time to to go and study is there time to get married is there time to do this you sound as if the Lord\n\n(1:20:55) is coming tomorrow yes I sound as if the Lord is coming tomorrow and I wish it is tomorrow but you must plan your life as though he is coming in 15 years and live your life as though he's coming tomorrow so yes go and educate yourself do you think God wants stupid people in heaven or uneducated people in heaven if\n\n(1:21:17) you have an opportunity uplift yourself go and work for the Lord the Lord needs educated people to go and do his thing go and work for the Lord God if you're good at raising families do it with prayer and raise families up for God's glory thus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed as it comes for\n\n(1:21:37) it is to be given with greatest power the sins of Babylon will be laid open that's what we did in the series in that message that we just read over there this is the summary the sins of Babylon will be laid open that's what the series was about the fear results of enforcing the observance of the church by civil\n\n(1:21:59) Authority must be made plain the inroads of spiritualism into the church must be made plain the stealthy but rapid progress of the papal power must be made plain the testimony that Babylon is the church Fallen because of her errors and sin all will be onmed have we done this in this series I hope so if not\n\n(1:22:25) then we will have failed we are heading for perilous times we are heading for a Time such as never was Romans 8:35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we\n\n(1:22:51) are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels no principalities no powers nor things presence nor things to come no height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us\n\n(1:23:10) from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord I believe that with my whole heart and I would love you all to believe it as well we serve amazing God and I'll tell you heaven will not be boring I guarantee it young people heaven will not be boring there will be Adventures like you cannot believe young\n\n(1:23:33) kids I'll travel with you on the biggest animal through the biggest jungle in the world just give your hearts to the Lord no

  "# Title:232_1844_the_final_onslaught_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\n1844 Prophecy,Sabbath vs Sunday,Ecumenism vs Separation,New World Order,Final Onslaught\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"1844 and the Final Onslaught,\" by Walter Veith, posits that 1844 is a pivotal prophetic year, marking the conclusion of the 2,300-day prophecy from Daniel 8:14, which initiated a \"cleansing of the sanctuary\" or a pre-advent judgment. This event is crucial because it highlights Jesus Christ's ongoing ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary as High Priest, a doctrine Veith argues is severely attacked because it positions Christ as the sole Savior and grants the Seventh-day Adventist Church a distinct, final message for the world. Veith contends that various movements and events coinciding with 1844, such as the writings of Karl Marx and Charles Darwin, the founding of the Baha'i Faith, and the discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus, represent a \"total onslaught\" against Jesus Christ and the unique message delivered by Adventists, specifically regarding the Sabbath and Christ's sanctuary ministry. The lecture emphasizes a looming global conflict between those upholding biblical truth, particularly the Sabbath, and a push for worldwide ecumenism led by the Papacy and other influential figures, culminating in a global spiritual struggle and a call for believers to remain steadfast.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 232 - 1844 & The Final Onslaught _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oC0-aWwz9k\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] I've titled this lecture 1844 and the final Onslaught you've probably realized by now that the final Onslaught is against Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ is often attacked in the form of his people as well and so we have to deliberate this question of 1844 see 1844 is the date of the end of the 2,300\n\n(01:33) day prophecy and according to this prophecy at the end of the eight of the 2,300 days there will be a cleansing of the sanctuary that means judgment will be announced and there will be a people to announce that judgment and we have seen in Revelation chap 10 how through the unsealing of the book The Seven 7 th Day\n\n(02:00) Adventist Church started preaching the Judgment hour message so 1844 is an important yard stick in Prophecy and 1844 also gives Credence to this final message and who presents it remember prophecy a day is a year and seven days would be seven years I've appointed you each day for a year Ezekiel after the\n\n(02:26) number of days in which you searched the land 40 days each day for a year numbers 14:34 and we discussed this Vision in Daniel chapter 8 where the time of the end is when this Vision will be unsealed how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both\n\n(02:51) the sanctuary and the hosts to be trodden under foot 70 weeks are determined upon thy people upon thy Holy City to finish trans ression to make an end to sin to make reconciliation for iniquity bring in Everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy Daniel 9:24 now this whole vision is the\n\n(03:14) vision of the coming of Christ the first part culminating then in 1844 a date that is just hanging in the air but which has great significance now I'm not going to deal with this part of the prophecy see there is a whole video called the Messiah but uh the first part just to briefly stated dealt with the coming of\n\n(03:40) the Messiah from the issuing of the decree to when the gospel went to the Gentiles 34 ad and the rabbis issued this curse May the bones of the hands and the bones of the fingers Decay and decompose of him who turns the pages of the Book of Daniel to find out the time of Daniel 9:24-27 and may his memory rot\n\n(04:04) from off the face of the Earth forever in very nice curse this is talmudic law this is in the talmud talmudic law page 978 section 2 line28 so obviously the rabbis didn't want anyone to recognize that Jesus was the Messiah because that would be a problem for the Jewish religion so it's a very sad fact that\n\n(04:29) this 2,300 day prophecy where the first portion identifies the Messiah should be under such a curse do you IM can you imagine or do you think it's possible that the last part of the same prophecy which introduces a people who will want to set Jesus Christ back into his rightful position would also be\n\n(04:58) under a curse is it possible don't you think that's possible I think the devil hates this prophecy more than any other because it reveals in the first part of the prophecy who Jesus Christ is that he is the Messiah and in the last part of the prophecy it reveals a people that will preach the Everlasting gospel to the\n\n(05:25) world and set Jesus back in his rightful position so there's a total Onslaught on the first part there's the curse there's a total Onslaught on the last part as well because Jesus must be eliminated from the hearts and minds of the people 1844 a judgment message was to go to the world and the sanctuary message was again\n\n(05:52) uncovered and understood and the fullness of the sanctuary the white linen as we have said the righteousness of Christ surrounding anyone who enters the door and the sacrifice and all the issues of the sanctuary Hebrews 8 vers1 and two we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of majesty\n\n(06:13) in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man so is there a Heavenly Sanctuary according to Hebrews 8 yes or no yes now this doctrine of the Heavenly Sanctuary where Christ is officiating as high priest is a doctr which is heavily under attack in the world why because it sets\n\n(06:44) Jesus Christ back into the center as the only savior in the world and it also tells us about his ministry and where he is officiating in the holy or the most holy is very important because according to Seventh Day Act Adventist Doctrine 1844 time of judgment must be yon kiuri must have gone into the most holy now if\n\n(07:06) that is so then the Seventh Day Adventist Church has a peculiar message to the world one explaining the sanctuary number one the ministry of Jesus the Judgment hour but it also makes them the herald of the final message that's a problem you can't have one denomination being a Herald of a final message you have to take that\n\n(07:30) denomination away and make it part of the pots of ecumenism nobody has the right to say we have a final message for the world that would be exclusivity in the thinking of the world so 1844 is heavily under attack and the doctrine that Jesus Christ entered the most holy in 1844 then shall the sanctuary be\n\n(07:57) cleansed anti-typical Dev of atonement is also heavily under attack Hebrews 9:3 and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all now holiest of all here in the Bible is hagah hagion that's what it says holiest of all and Paul here uses this word Hagia hagion for the most holy and it's\n\n(08:30) definitely after the second Veil very important so the word ha haon is used for after the veil so un 2,300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed Daniel 814 457 BC the decree went out 1844 is the date when you add the 2,300 years the first part of the of the prophecy here divided into 70 weeks cut off from\n\n(08:58) this fits the Messiah so perfectly that the Jews the rabbis have cursed anyone who studies it lest they find the Messiah now what about this 1844 is this the Judgment Herald and is there a particular group of people coming out of a great disappointment who will preach this message and they will keep the\n\n(09:24) Commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus but Christ Hebrews 911 and 12 but Christ being come a high priest by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us that's the King James version and it has translated this passage here of H as holy Place\n\n(09:51) Christ being come a high priest by his own blood entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us and the word used there is hagon Holy Place actually hagon doesn't necessarily have to mean holy place it could just mean Sanctuary the King James version has turned it into holy place so\n\n(10:19) the fact of the matter is when Jesus died and he was resurrected he went into the sanctuary now where did he serve after he went into the sanctuary if there is a Heavenly Sanctuary well according to this he went into the sanctu he must have gone into the holy place that's the King James version now if he went into the holy\n\n(10:44) Place upon his resurrection that means that according to the je Jewish type sometime thereafter whenever that is he must go from the holy into the most holy isn't that right sometime thereafter what whatever that time is now we don't know what time that is except we have one prophecy which says after\n\n(11:07) 2,300 days then will the sanctuary be cleansed that means we have a date 1844 when he could go into that Holy place or the most holy place that's the only prophecy there is so did he enter into the holy or did he enter into the most holy when he went up to heaven he's become a high priest by his own blood\n\n(11:32) having obtained Eternal Redemption seven annual Jewish feasts and types and antiy type remember we did them the Passover the unle bread the first fruits when Jesus uh died laid in the grave and was resurrected A Feast of Weeks Pentecost and when he came the first time he paid the price for sin that's what he did\n\n(11:56) then the seven annual feasts we talked about them the trumpets heralding judgment that would be the second Advent movement that would start in 1844 if it is true day of atonement pre-advent judgment and Tabernacle so this is where we are living today and 1844 is a powerful cutof date homegoing Harvest of redemption so when\n\n(12:23) Jesus came the first time he paid the price for sin did he take us all away from this terrible planet yes or no no when he comes the second time is the Harvest of redemption then all the saved will be taken up to him and the day of atonement was the annual cleansing of the Earthly Sanctuary so basically the doctrine says\n\n(12:49) that since 1844 because that's the only date we have we have been living in what the Bible calls judgment hour so 1844 judgment hour then the end of the world then comes eternity at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which stands for the children of thy people there will be a time of trouble and the\n\n(13:11) people will be delivered that are found written in the book but remember Daniel shut up the words because they are for the time of the end now we dealt with this when we dealt with the lecture on Revelation chapter 10 so I'm not going to go into great detail again suffice to say that the time of the end was defined there as from the\n\n(13:37) end of the 1,260 days 538 ad papal Supremacy 1798 and from that time onwards The Three Angels messages would go to the world now do you know what's fascinating is that the world has changed some of these criteria for example they are saying that Christ did not enter into the holy place but that he entered into the most holy place and\n\n(14:09) if you have a new King James Bible it actually says that the new King James Bible changed the wording where the King James had it holy Place changed it to Most Holy place but here's a problem because most holy is hagah hagion and it only says haon so it doesn't say haah haon so why would they change it you see if Jesus went into the\n\n(14:41) most holy when he was raised from the dead and went to heaven then there is no special special circumstance around 1844 do you understand that whereas if Jesus went into the holy well then 1844 becomes prominent and there is a special message and a special people to give it so 1844 must be rubbed out removed and there are whole\n\n(15:11) movements to remove it terrible movements now my question is simple and this is this if Jesus went to heaven to serve in the sanctuary and the Bible says that he didn't enter by the blood of sheep and goats but by his own precious blood then when did he serve in the Holy if he went to the most holy if the king new King James is right\n\n(15:42) and he went into the most holy when did he serve in the Holy because after all in the Earthly which is a copy of the Heavenly and is a copy of the service in the Heavenly he must have served sometime in the Holy when was that when then it must have been before he came to this earth right because when\n\n(16:01) he left this Earth again he went into the most holy according to the new King James is that right okay question with which blood with which blood did he serve in the Holy before he came here with the blood of sheep and goats no so in other words Jesus could not have entered the most holy when he went\n\n(16:25) to heaven he could only have entered the holy so no matter how much they cry and how much they weep and wail over the fact that 1844 is a prophetic date they're going to sit with a problem Jesus could only have gone into the hagon sanctuary holy place when he went up to heaven because that's the first time he had his own blood to serve\n\n(16:53) with that means he must have gone into the most holy at the latest stage and the only date we have is 1844 so 1844 stands like it or not now roundabout this date this important end of time date or time of the end date at least during the same period that the remnant preaches a message of Separation Satan sets up a\n\n(17:15) counterfeit of unity starting with the French Revolution remember he replaces the law of God with his own Earthly standard called human rights and he puts the fascism on there and he puts the uh eye of Lucifer and the all lifegiving Serpent and he puts the Hat of Mitra on there so at this time period we have Freemasonry\n\n(17:40) spiritualism theosophy false prophets Mormon movement Jehovah's Witnesses Christian Science movement and at the same time God raises up a standard against it keeping the Commandments of God and preaching a Three Angels message only the Seventh Day Adventist Church does this no no other Church in the\n\n(17:59) whole world no other Church in the whole world preaches the sanctuary message of what the sanctuary stood for there's only one church that does it in the whole world Seventh Day Adventist Church it's kind of strange interesting events around 1844 Carl Marx he joined the league of the justs in 1842 later the league of\n\n(18:18) Communists and he started writing the Communist Manifesto in 1844 what does that say it says there is no God let alone Jesus Christ let's get rid of him so Jesus Christ is removed same time another message goes into the world Darin the Origin of Species the Origin of Species that mystery of mysteries when did he start writing it\n\n(18:43) this is the for word to the Origin of Species and you'll find something interesting I allowed myself to speculate on the subject and Drew up some short notes these are enlarged in 1844 it's very interesting second time we find 1844 in a very prominent place where we have an end time lying delusion going into the\n\n(19:04) world and there's a little group that says no there are many others as well but they don't have the fullness of the Three Angels message nor do they have a sanctu message isn't it interesting that the greatest representation at the United Nations the bahai faith was found when by the Bob there's the date 18\n\n(19:28) 44 the bahai faith was founded in 1844 by Baha Allah a faith founded by the bab meaning Gat so 1844 we finally get to a point where the world is ready for a movement which will say all churches unite who's behind this movement that's another story I think we figured that out by now because who has the power in\n\n(19:56) the United Nations they or Roman Catholicism Roman Catholicism has the power so this is just a tool but 1844 is an interesting date the bahai faith upholds the fundamental Unity of all religions that's their first Criterion independent investigation of Truth blah blah blah and all these interesting things we've dealt with some of these\n\n(20:17) already tainment of world peace and we've discussed this well I went into the bahai temple and they have three books there the Holy Bible then they have the Quran and then they have the messages of the Baha now that was interesting to me so I read it in the temple read it and I found this page most interesting so I photographed it\n\n(20:47) page 217 and it says oh contending peoples and kindreds of the earth set your face towards Unity see this is the message of our time and this message of unity goes into the world what date 1844 message of unity and let the radiance of its light shine upon you gather you together and for the sake of God resolve to root out whatever is the\n\n(21:14) source of contention amongst you then will the elgance of the world's great luminary oh I get nervous when I hear that name don't you envelop the whole earth and its inhabitants become the citizens of one city and the occupants of one and the same Throne whose Throne do you think that will be I think it'll be Lucifer's Throne\n\n(21:38) this wronged one capitalized now if you don't know one is an acran for Lucifer in the O occult world has ever since the early days of his life cherished none other desire but this and will continue to entertain no wish except this wish there can be no doubt whatever that the peoples of the world of whatever race or\n\n(22:00) religion derive their inspiration from one Heavenly source and are subject to one God the difference between the ordinances under which they abide should be attributed to varying requirements and existes of the age in which they were revealed all of them except a few which are the outcome of human perversity were ordained of\n\n(22:23) God that's interesting all of them in the world were ordained of God except a few who are perverse I wonder who they are they were ordained of God and are a reflection of his will and purpose arise and armed with the power of Faith shattered to Pieces the gods of your Vain imaginings and soers of dissension amongst you ooh\n\n(22:48) ooh cleave unto that which draweth you together and a message of unity 1844 a message of Separation who gives the message of Separation this strange crowd that preaches the Three Angels message and uh except a few who are the outcome of human perversity interesting Dan Wheatley writes as a bahai I see myself\n\n(23:20) as a world Citizen and I strongly believe that the world is moving closer to a United Global Community a human family unity in diversity may sound like just another sound bite a trite piece of verbal cosmetics in an age where content is less important than presentation the reality is that the concept of unity and\n\n(23:39) diversity is a deeply spiritual concept that is a key tenant of the bigh faith and it is an essential concept to bear in mind when trying to find solutions to a wide range of global problems so this is the greatest representation in the United Nations so this is not just some you know little offs shoot squeaky group\n\n(23:59) somewhere and they are there for a reason to have a big voice what does it mean to be ecumenical it means the whole inhabited World serving the wronged one modern spiritualism and all these things that we have dealt with the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the\n\n(24:20) temple from heaven from Throne saying it is done sooner or later God is going to end this life on this Earth and all the blavatsky and all the anib basant and all the Alice bis bailees with their doctrines from demonology will be exposed for what they are because they literally worship Lucifer after all this\n\n(24:45) was published by Lucifer publishing company so who else do they worship later changed to luci's trust to hide the name or all these strange prophets that came here's another interesting date 1844 the CTIC manuscript codec cicus is discovered in Mount Si and forms the basis of all modern translations which\n\n(25:09) remove Jesus Christ as God and as the only savior of mankind do you think it's chance do you think this is chance this is very strange so at the same time when this message of separation and worship God and give glory to him there's only one savior one gospel one means of Salvation all these things come together\n\n(25:32) and the date is 1844 and you remember Genesis 3:15 I'll put enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed and he shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel is changed by Catholicism into she shall Crush thy head so here we see this interesting battle evolving in the last\n\n(25:55) days this is Robert M he was the under Secretary General of the United Nations remember the world's major religions in the end all want the same thing even though they were born in different places and circumstances you remember that story what the world needs is a convergence of the different religions\n\n(26:13) in the search and definition of the cosmic or Divine laws which ought to regulate our Behavior worldwide spiritual ecumenism that is what they want everybody to come together peace will be impossible without The Taming of fundamentalism through a United religion that professes faithfulness only to Global the global spirituality and to\n\n(26:37) the health of this planet so now these two groups are coming into opposition with each other the new world religion says Alisa Bailey must be based upon those truths for which have stood the test of time they are steadily taking shape in human thinking and for them the United Nations fights my great personal\n\n(26:56) dream is to get a tremendous this alliance between all the major religions and the United States Robert Miller so the churches come together two messages in the worlds now the Seventh Day Adventist Church also has the message do not accept the mark of the beast Sabbath is the day of the Lord worship Him who made the heavens the\n\n(27:20) Earth the Sea and the Springs of water papacy comes and says no you must listen to me I'll tell you what when to worship you'll Worship On the first day of the week because I am the authority in your life and so the papacy in on May 7 1998 issued this famous Apostolic letter D Domin of the Holy Father John Paul where\n\n(27:45) he asks for Sunday legislation Sunday the primordial Feast revealing the meaning of time the spiritual and pastoral Riches of Sunday as it has been handed onto Us by tradition not truly great well at least he admits it's not from the Bible right significantly the catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that the Sunday\n\n(28:08) celebration of the Lord's day and his Eucharist is at the heart of the church's life and then he explains who you worship on Sunday this is his document this is Pope John Paul's encyclical as they listen to the word proclaimed on the Sunday Assembly the faithful looked to whom to Mary now what did blavatsky say who is\n\n(28:31) Mary she says Mary is really anthropomorphized Isis and is really really Lucifer that's what blavatsky said we did that in a previous lecture so they look to the Virgin Mary learning from her to keep it and ponder it in their hearts with Mary they learned to stand at the foot of the cross offering the father etc etc with Mary they\n\n(28:53) experience the joy of the resurrection and so he goes on and on on and on and on and on his Mercy is from age to age from Sunday to Sunday the pilgrim PE people following the footsteps of Mary now if you do not understand occult language and this doesn't mean much but if you know that to them this Mary figure is really a form\n\n(29:18) of the great luminary who can be both male or female then this is serious business because I would like to follow the lord Jesus Christ when I go to worship Him and according to this this is not what happens on a Sunday now if you obey the papacy in this decree that he's asking for here then who are you\n\n(29:41) worshiping God or this one obviously this one he goes on to continue only in the fourth Century that the civil law of the Roman Empire recognized the weekly cousins determined that on the day of the Sun the judges the people of the cities and the various trade corporations would not work and so he says it would therefore be wrong to\n\n(30:04) see in this old legislation of the rhythm of the week a mere historical circumstance with no special significance for the church and which you could simply set aside even after the fall of the Empire the councils did not cease to insist upon the arrangements regarding Sunday rest so he says don't think that was history I'm\n\n(30:25) talking about now and then he goes on to quote the famous encyclical of Pope Leo rum novarum and then he says therefore also in the particular circumstances of our own time Christians will naturally strive to ensure that civil legislation respects their duty to keep Sunday holy so he's asking for civil\n\n(30:49) legislation for Sunday and Sunday Times London came up Pope launches crusade to save Sunday make it clear that Sunday must not be worked since it must be celebrated as the Lord's day that brings him into a clash with the word of God and the Sabbath issue even Israel's minister of the Interior wants to have Sunday\n\n(31:16) introduced that is an interesting one June 2000 Z mention so we have human rights yes but those human rights are qualified if IED that as long as you obey the papal system you have these rights here's a right to freedom of religion but freedom of religion means that you are not allowed to preach to anyone about Jesus Christ\n\n(31:45) or about any Doctrine because that would be an offense to the others Freedom not yours and then he came up with this fascinating in iCal called ad to endm fidom by which certain Norms are inserted into the code of canon law and into the code of Canon laws of the Eastern churches and Canon 1436 of the\n\n(32:08) Catholic church now is to read according to Pope John Paul 2 whoever denies or places in doubt any truth that must be believed with Divine and Catholic faith or repudiates the Christian faith as a whole and does not come to his senses after having been legitimately warned is to be punished as a heretic oh\n\n(32:25) fascinating so pop John Paul 2 asks that people who do don't agree with him must be punished as Heretics when last did they speak like that in the Middle Ages well they can be punished with penalties not including de excluding their position take away what belongs to you aside from such cases whoever\n\n(32:48) rejects a Doctrine proposed as definitively to be held by the Roman pontiff question did he not just Define that we must keep Sunday yes or no all right now what if I'm an Adventist the Seventh Day Adventist and I say the Bible says the seventh day do I then come into a clash with him yes or no yes by the Roman pontiff or\n\n(33:11) the College of Bishops exercising their authentic magisterium or else accepts a Doctrine condemned by them as erroneous didn't he just say what he believes and anything else is not right and does not come to his senses after having been legit timately want is to be punished by an appropriate penalty very nice\n\n(33:31) wording what was the appropriate penalty in the past death death was the appropriate penalty do you think I could go that far do you think they could go that far well it's interesting and then we order that everything decreed by US capital in this Apostolic letter Moto priori be firm and valid and we command that it be inserted\n\n(33:56) in the Universal law of the Catholic church that is in the code of canon law and the code of cannons blah blah blah blah blah given at Rome St Peter's 18 May 1998 in the 20th year of our Capital pontificate that's quite arrogant us and our capitalized who else uses us in our capitals God let us make man in our\n\n(34:25) image so the pope said says here very cryptically that he's God and he's ruling you and he's telling you to keep Sunday whether you like it or not remember that when we did Revelation chapter 10 I told you there are only two truly worldwide religious movements in the world the one is the Roman Catholic\n\n(34:45) system the other one is the Seventh Day Adventist Church the Roman Catholic system preachers keep Sunday and keep my Commandments and the seventh day Adventist Church preachers keep God's Commandments stay faithful to him and the Sabbath is a sign of obedience to God will keep the Sabbath listen to the word of God don't listen\n\n(35:07) to the word of man well you remember this one made in 1969 by the Catholic church not the creator of the universe in Genesis 21 but the Catholic church can claim the honor of having granted man a pause to his work every seven days reason and Common Sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these\n\n(35:26) alternatives e protestantism and the keeping holy of Saturday or catholicity and the keeping holy of Sunday compromise is impossible do you remember that it was Rome speaking and she says Sunday is The Offspring of the Catholic Church we've read that without Protestant reprisal and she says you can read the Bible from Genesis to\n\n(35:45) Revelation you will not find one scripture authorizing Sunday and they're quite right they've done their homework Cardinal Giblin knows his Bible they adamant that it's a creation of the Catholic cic church it's a law of the Catholic church and Protestants pay homage to the Catholic church when they\n\n(36:02) obey now in the question box they answered that in this matter the Sabbath question the Seventh Day Adventist is the only consistent Protestant now that was in 1942 and I showed you as well that the Cardinal wrote here people who think that the scriptures should be the sole Authority should locally become seventh\n\n(36:28) day Adventists and keep Saturday holy now that's fascinating stuff and you'll say That's History maybe Rome's changed well I have news for you here is Rome's Challenge and it comes from the Roman Catholic web page Immaculate heart.com and it was issued in December 2003 how long ago is that okay and let me read it to you it's\n\n(36:54) very fascinating what the Roman Catholic church has to say today on this issue most Christians there's that it comes straight from them not from me I didn't make this up most Christians assume that Sunday is the biblically approved day of worship the Roman Catholic Church protests that it transferred Christian worship from the\n\n(37:14) biblical Sabbath Saturday to Sunday and that to try to argue that the change was made in the Bible is both dishonest and a denial of Catholic Authority if protestantism wants to base its teachings only on the Bible it should worship on Saturday right that's the Roman Catholic Church speaking today do you think they might go further\n\n(37:37) that would be interesting what else have you got to say well they republished this article that they had published in 1893 from which I quot it in the last uh Lector now why are they re quoting this full article on the on the Catholic web page well they're saying over here in February 24 1893 the General Conference of seventh\n\n(38:06) day Adventists adopted certain resolutions appealing to the government and people of the United States from the decision of the Supreme Court declaring this to be a Christian Nation and from the action of Congress Congress in legislating upon the subject of religion and in answer to this in March 1993 the\n\n(38:27) international religious liberty Association printed these resolutions in attract entitled appeal and remonstrant and on receipt of these the edition of the Catholic mirror of Baltimore Maryland published a series of four editorials which appeared in that paper September 2916 231 1893 and the Catholic mirror was the\n\n(38:50) official or organ of Cardinal Gibbons and the Vatican in the United States so it's a very official document that they published so why did they publish this because the seventh day Adventists appealed to keep church and state separate now their web page Mary online reprints this whole article and I'm not\n\n(39:13) going to deal with it in detail again basically the article is a expose of Sabbath and it is a wonderful study better or equal to what any scholar in the Seventh Day Adventist Church would come up with saying why the Sabbath is the day of the Lord so they prove from the Bible that the Sabbath the seventh\n\n(39:38) day is the day of the Lord so that they can claim that they changed it they're not shy of having changed it they're not hiding it they admit it they're arrogant about it those are the facts so now let's continue I'll just quote a little bit from that one where they said Protestants say how can I receive the\n\n(39:56) teach teachings of an apostate Church how we asked have you managed to receive her teachings all your life in direct opposition to your recognized teacher the Bible on the Sabbath question that was that article in 1893 and then those who follow the Bible as they guide the Israelites on Seventh Day Adventists have the exclusive weight\n\n(40:13) of evidence on their side so they published this again and then they State over here the Adventists are the only body of Christians with the Bible as their teacher who can find no warrant in its Pages for the change of the of the day from the 7eventh to the 1 hence their appellation 7th Day Adventists and so we continue they write\n\n(40:35) there no Protestant living today has ever yet obeyed that command preferring to follow the apostate Church in adverted commer refer to than its teacher the Bible which from Genesis to Revelation teaches no other Doctrine should the Israelites and Seventh Day Adventists be correct both sides appeal to the Bible as their infallible teacher\n\n(40:59) let the Bible decide whether Saturday or Sunday be the day enjoined by God one of the two bodies must be wrong and then they give this long Bible study about this issue and then there's an editor's note and notice this interesting editor's note it was upon this very point that the Reformation was condemned\n\n(41:21) by the Council of Trent wow did you know that the whole Reformation failed at the Council of Trent because of the Sabbath issue did you know that wow what happens interesting you see the reformers had constantly charged as is here stated that the Catholic church had apostasis from the truth as contained in the\n\n(41:49) written word the written word the Bible and the Bible only thus says the Lord these were their constant watch wordss and the scripture as in the written word the sole standard of appeal this was the proclaimed platform of the reformation and of protestantism the scripture and tradition that was what the Catholic\n\n(42:10) Church said the Bible has interpreted by the church and according to the unanimous consent of the fathers this was the position and claim of the Catholic church this was the main issue in the Council of Trent interesting point which was called especially to consider the question question that had been raised and forced upon the\n\n(42:28) attention of Europe by the reformers did you know that the Reformation could have succeeded it could have succeeded finally after a long and intensive strain because there were many Catholics who were willing to give up tradition and accept the Bible and the Bible alone it was knif cutting edge stuff Archbishop of Rego came into the\n\n(42:56) council was substantially the following arguments to the party who held the scripture alone and he said the Protestants claim to stand upon the written word only they profess to hold the scripture alone as the standard of Faith they justify their Revolt by The Plea that the church has apostasis from\n\n(43:12) the written word and follows Tradition now the Protestants claim that they stand upon the written word only is not true the profession of holding scripture alone is the standard of fa is false proof the word explicitly adjoins the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath they do not observe the seventh\n\n(43:31) day but reject it that was his argument if they truly hold to the scriptures alone as their standard they would be observing the seventh day as enjoined by the scriptures yet they not only reject the observance of the Sabbath enjoined in the written word but they have adopted and do practice the observance\n\n(43:47) of Sunday which they have only tradition of the church consequently the claim of scripture alone as the standard fails and the the doctrine of scripture and tradition as essential is fully established the Protestants themselves being judges so the Reformation failed because of the Sabbath issue that's very\n\n(44:10) interesting then he continues this was the inconsistency of protestant practice with the Protestant profession that gave the Catholic Church a long sort and anxiously desired ground upon which to condemn protestantism and the whole Reformation movement as only a selfish ambitious Rebellion against Church Authority then\n\n(44:34) they continued and this is today the position of the respective parties to this controversy today as the document shows this is the vital issue upon which the Catholic church arraigns protestantism and upon which she condemns the course of popular protestantism as being indefensible self-contradictory and suicidal what\n\n(44:56) what will these Protestants what will this protestantism do wow what a challenge that was wasn't that a challenge so the Reformation failed because of the Sabbath issue isn't it interesting that the Bible says in when it talks about Sardis in the seven churches I have not found your work complete in the eyes of God\n\n(45:22) nevertheless there will be those in sardus who will walk Walk With Me In White and I believe they will the Luthers and the malons and all these great reformers will walk in white they walked after the best light that they had but they knew of the Sabbath issue but they refused to backtrack in fact their own alburg confession\n\n(45:45) condemned them now let's see what the editor of Mary online made with this letter December 2003 and take notes the challenge issued by Rome over 100 years ago remains these Apostolic writings that were published then either the Catholic church is right or the seventh day Adventists are right there can be no\n\n(46:15) other choice now that's not me saying this I didn't invent it this is the Roman Catholic Church speaking to day and now you understand why I'm in this position so who do they declare as they their confirmed opponent what does the Roman Catholic Church say who's the only consistent Protestant and who's the only one that\n\n(46:43) opposes them on this issue the Seventh Day Adventist Church now can you understand why the Seventh Day Adventist Church is a rebuke not only to Catholicism but also to protestantism yes or no it must be and so they will be reviled and called sects by both Catholicism and protestantism so basically if this is so I have been\n\n(47:12) preaching it here this is the position of the Seventh Day Adventist Church irrespective of what others are doing and Catholicism agrees heartily in fact says the editor there can can be no other choice if you look then at the 1999 Interfaith meeting where the pope was elected as the spiritual leader of\n\n(47:37) the world where it was asked that they join in condemning the Christian fundamentalists who abuse speech and whose efforts at converting others inight hatred and violence who is that then directed to largely do you think must be the Seventh Day Adventist because they are the consistent Protestants that preach against\n\n(47:59) anti-biblical doctrines all present were have one Accord two key points Pope John Paul 2 was endorsed by consensus as the planet speech Chief spiritual guide and overseer and these religious fundamentalists who refuse to go along with a global ecumenical movement are to be silenced well who are they who are\n\n(48:21) they they've just identified them they said who the problem child is and George double Bush says the best way to honor Pope John Paul 2 truly one of the Great Men is to take his teaching seriously to listen to his words and put his words into teachings here into here in action into America this is a challenge we must\n\n(48:40) accept so is the United States going to accept papal Doctrine or is it going to accept biblical Doctrine papal Doctrine he just said so so they want to make laws and this is another thing that revelation says they will do it so we can see a world CH Clash coming along let's have a look at these interesting quotes these are every\n\n(49:03) single one here is referenced God works in many ways through many faiths and religious agency this is one reason for the elimination of non-essential doctrines you see if something doesn't fit into the ecumenism what must you do with it get rid of it what doesn't fit into ecumenism Sabbath key in it must go\n\n(49:28) other steps will also be taken in this department of religion and education over which the Christ rules and he will move to restore the ancient spiritual landmarks to eliminate that which is non-essential and to reorganize the entire religious field again in preparation for the restoration of the Mysteries these Mysteries when restored\n\n(49:49) will unify all faiths question can we go along with that yes or no answer is no this is a serious issue new Agia Natalie Bank States looking below the seething service of surface of outer events we become aware of the spreading move towards the elimination of sectarian separa Tess and an increasing distaste for\n\n(50:15) Reliance on hard and fast Doctrine and Dogma at the same time there's an intensified search for a deeper understanding of the inner teachings and their application to the enormous problems of today so what are they looking for get rid of those doctrines which separat can you see how the Sabbath is becoming a mighty issue how we will have\n\n(50:39) to stand for truth and righteousness and Jesus Christ is to be just scrapped in the shredder this is a total Onslaught on Jesus Christ through his people Thomas ER Zella director of world Federalists assert the growing number of people are sponsoring a backlash against the wave of religious fundamental\n\n(51:02) fanaticism the right course to take is that which will lead to a new world of unity and World law one quote after another Alisa Bailey said the same the day is Dawning when all religions will be regarded as emanating from One Source they will accept the same truths not as theological Concepts but as\n\n(51:23) essential to spiritual living a Brotherhood of human relations well that might sound nice on paper but it's not what God says thus the expression aims and efforts of the United Nations will be eventually brought to fruition and a new Church of God gathered out of all religions and spiritual groups will\n\n(51:45) unitedly bring to an end the Great heresy of separateness love unity and the Risen Christ will be present and he will demonstrate to us the perfect life the great heresy of separateness what does the loud cry say come out and be separate there's a huge Clash here now I understand why the United Nations made a point of coming to\n\n(52:14) speak to my denomination and say there's only one way and that's the United Nations there's only one body that will do it and that's the United Nations blah blah blah blah blah well he might have said that but me personally I'm not interested in that she states that the enlightened people will not tolerate authoritarianism in\n\n(52:34) any church or totalitarianism in any political system they will not accept or permit the rule of any body of men who undertake to tell them what they must believe in order to be saved oops so what if the Bible says there is only one way under Heaven and Earth whereby you may be saved and that that is through Christ Jesus they will not\n\n(52:58) permit us to say that right you may not say that anymore well it's already against the law it's against the hate laws William Irvin Thomas a new Ager indicates that the form of the church and the new age will remain the same thus churchgoers are less likely to notice that there has been a change in the message he says the new spirituality\n\n(53:19) does not reject the earlier patterns of the great Universal religions priests and church will not disappear they will not be forced out of existence in the new age they will be absorbed into existence of the new age isn't that brilliant God has called a movement since 1844 to stand against this movement and what a crisis we are going\n\n(53:43) to face what a crisis we are going to face I have the worst invitation for you in the world how would you like to come to an organization that's going to be the Pariah of the world the most distasteful the most hated sect in all the world and they keep the Sabbath contrary to a law of the Roman Catholic Church\n\n(54:09) which is to be propagated in all the world and come and be a hated sectarian nice invitation who's going to follow that doesn't sound too good to me but what if the other side is going to see the wroth of God and God has promised to protect all those who rally around his word wouldn't that be an interesting\n\n(54:37) scenario and who would answer to a request like that I'll tell you who will answer only those who really believe and trust that Jesus will do it no one else is there a better separating message than this I don't think so I don't think so preparation by men and women of Goodwill is needed to introduce new\n\n(55:03) values of living new standards of behavior New Attitudes World teacher will be mainly concerned with requirements of a new world order and a reorganization of the social structure that was a flyer from World Goodwill this is not a Mickey Mouse organization this was founded by all the great leaders of the world Robert Miller Wells\n\n(55:25) the world rights the world's major religions must speed up dramatically their ecumenical movement and recognize the unity of their objectives in the diversity of their Cults religions must actively cooperate to bring to unprecedented Heights a better understanding of the mysteries of life and of our place in the universe My\n\n(55:44) Religion right or wrong my nation right or wrong must be abandoned forever in the planetary age sorry the Bible and the Bible alone or nothing right amen Jesus was wrong says DW who is he dul is a demon who speak spoke to Alicea Bailey Jesus was wrong about the dividing of the sheep and the goats it\n\n(56:10) has been thought that the that the Sheep went to heaven and the goats went to hell it's the other way round remember that this is not a joke that the United Nations has said that they based their writings on Alice Bailey who channeled DW cool this is not a joke this is serious stuff The Goat in Capricorn is the initiate and from a\n\n(56:32) certain esoteric angle the goats do go to heaven because they function in the spiritual Kingdom the Sheep remain on Earth until they become goats what a lot of rubbish entrance into heaven declares dwalu is entrance into the Aquarian age and pisan Christian other words forces will be receding rapidly this is a war on Jesus\n\n(56:53) Christ this this is not a war on any sect or individual we just happen to be caught in the middle with a choice World good will stay the radiant light the message of Christ cannot have anything to do with somber teachings of the churches based on death crucifixtion Agony eternal hell wroth of a vengeful\n\n(57:14) God to build a new civilization based on the emerging new Consciousness in humanity the church organizations if they want to survive will have to adjust to the spiritual hierarchy that means the Demonic leadership of the new age this is a problem Humanity will not be able to make the transition from\n\n(57:34) Earth only to universal life until the chaff has separated from the wheat Democratic vice president nominee for 19 1984 and executive director of the world future Society Bara marks hbert doesn't mince words wow she surely doesn't no worldly peace can Prevail until the self-centered me members of the\n\n(57:55) planetary body either change or die that is the choice they must surely die or change what did the pope say they must be condemned as a heretic and they must suffer an appropriate penalty well let's ask his cronies what the penalty is change or die that's the penalty the ACT is is as horrible as killing a cancer\n\n(58:22) cell it must be done for the sake of the future of the whole well I don't have to read all these quotes about defective seeds and they must be cut out do while cool speaking to Alisa Bailey a violent strepto coic germ and infection has maned the maned the life of humanity The Germ makes its present felt in infected\n\n(58:42) areas in the human in the body of humanity another surgical operation may be necessary to get rid it has to go death is not a disaster much destruction will be permitted do you think we're heading for another out switch experience I don't want to make anybody afraid but these are just quotes these hindrances will be brought under the\n\n(59:08) care of the great ones who will nurse them back to a healthy State thank you you stay yourself I don't need your Healthy State this can be done much better and more quickly without the physical body see how clever this is well let's just transport him to the other side Ruth Montgomery says that the souls will have passed into the spirit\n\n(59:28) to rethink their attitudes these are all absolute bomber quotes they are real they're not jokes former New Ager Randall bear states that those who refuse the mark of the beast will be targeted for extermination and what would emphatically be called re-education centers of love and relocation must change or perish says a\n\n(59:54) Templeton Prize winner remember that Billy Graham was a Templeton Prize winner now this is a high horse Dr odler he's chairman of the board of editors of Encyclopedia encyclopedia britanica director of The Institute for philosophical research in Chicago chairman of the paa project honorary Trustee of the Aspen Institute and\n\n(1:00:19) highly honored by the highest forums in the world he says simply state Adler argues that we will not be able to attain world peace until we attain cultural Unity but he argues that there is only one obstacle to this Unity Christianity which Christianity the one that stands on the Bible and the Bible alone Christianity\n\n(1:00:44) claims Supernatural knowledge and divine revelation that is divisive and not open to rational debate should not be tolerated these are high individuals who are saying these things so a Christianity that is based on absolutely the Bible cannot be tolerated you know what I'm excited you know why because we must be\n\n(1:01:12) so close to the end and if you knew the promises that God has in store for them that love him wow and how God will protect his people like like he protected the Israelites of old do these people know that plagues are coming and that God will make a difference between his people and them he made a difference amongst the\n\n(1:01:35) Egyptians there were 10 plagues the first three fell on everyone but the last seven only on the Egyptians how many plagues at the end of time are we going to dispense with the first three isn't that nice I'm telling you something it's worth it to follow God they can bark as much as they like they are barking up the wrong\n\n(1:02:03) tree amen they are fighting Gods wow God snaps his finger and they would be gone what arrogance Christian churches R Rothchild in reality an illusion must also kill out all separa liveness you see that's the problem and learn to cooperate with all the other faiths whose scriptures are of equal value and Beauty as the New\n\n(1:02:28) Testament okay continue Christopher hayatt refers to Christian fundamentalist as the shadow in emerging Society he reveals how this changing of the Gods will take place and the Earth still requires some blood these people will have to be eradicated I see has required a lot of blood disruption chaos and pain for a mass change to occur\n\n(1:02:54) Bailey's booklet advises there must be no distress Over The Disappearance of the old order okay the good the true and the Beautiful is on its way and for it mankind is responsible and not some outer divine intervention what does the the Seventh Day Adventist Church teach there will be an outer divine\n\n(1:03:19) intervention that's what the seventh day Adventists teach do you what the other denominations teach no there will be a Rapture and a total conversion that's a lie protestantism is even lying to its own people it's not what the Bible teaches John 16:2 they shall put you out of the synagogues yay the time cometh\n\n(1:03:42) that whoever kth you will think that he doeth God's service that's biblical John 16:33 these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world right this was the video that was on uh National Television\n\n(1:04:07) by CNN after the September 11 event in war countries suffer casualties the risk in a democracy like the United States is that the constitution will be one of them here are some of the new rules suspects can be held for up to 7 days without being charged with anything the Los Angeles Times reported this past\n\n(1:04:29) week that more than a thousand are being detained also The Government Can Eaves drop on any conversations these detainees have with their lawyers the feds used to have to have evidence get a judge to authorize the eavesdropping no longer suspicion is enough also foreigners can be Tried by special military courts these would be secret no\n\n(1:04:48) reporters allowed the defendants might or might not have lawyers how would we know the courts could admit evidence that would be inadmissible in Civil Court heay gossip whatever juries wouldn't have to be unanimous to sentence defendants to Deaths there would be no appeals got to be able to do this the government says to fight Terror\n\n(1:05:06) anyway Attorney General John Ashcraft says foreign terrorists do not deserve the protections of the American Constitution United States Patrick Ley of Vermont says it sends a message that it is acceptable to hold secret trials and summary executions without the possibility of judicial review which is\n\n(1:05:23) certainly true New York Times columnist William SFL says the president of the United States has just assumed what amounts to dictatorial power to jail or execute aliens the is precedent during World War II the United States secretly tried Germans who landed here by submarine with plans for Sait they were convicted\n\n(1:05:41) most were hanged and the Supreme Court upheld that action so secret star chamber trials are apparently constitutional but they do deny defendants the protection the Constitution offers on the other hand and the men who bombed the World Trade Center in 1993 were tried in civil court with constitutional protections and that\n\n(1:06:00) seemed to work maybe the question is what kind of a message does it send when a country that Prides itself on its freedoms its democracy says yes we can hold you for a week without charging you yes we can EAS drop when you talk to your lawyer and if you're foreign we can try you and kill you in secret is that\n\n(1:06:19) what democracies do I'm Bruce Morton now what is interesting is that George Bush qualified this and said if you now speak deliberately against the United States then you also qualify as a terrorist that's interesting so they can hold you without trial they can put you to death I mean all these laws are now in place\n\n(1:06:43) there's nothing that you need to wait for some major change to happen everything is in place everything can happen very quickly a period of extreme tribulation and unprecedented misery is soon to cover the entire world destruction of undesirable ele elements this is lorri Krishna uh Ki avat speaking maharashi\n\n(1:07:09) mahes yoga interesting man what does he say the man who brought the occultic practice of Transcendental Meditation says there has not and there will not be a place for the unfit the fit will lead and the unfit are not coming along there's no place for them in the Age of Enlightenment there's no place for\n\n(1:07:29) ignorant people interesting Matthew Fox remember this is this famous Catholic Theologian he speaks of the new age with its four billion occupants what happened to the other three billion what happened to them author John Randol price author of super beings identifies Christians in the statement there are some groups who continue to\n\n(1:07:52) cling to the Absurd IDE idea that man is a miserable Sinner and a worm of the Dust he also notifies us that 2 and a half billion people will be killed and uh new Ager humanist John duny refers to Christianity as a rotting corpse we could go on and on this is a nice man uh Prince Phillip he says in the event that I am reincarnated I would\n\n(1:08:15) like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve over a population these people are high occultists they're very friendly Ted Turner chairman of the better world society called Christians bozos and losers and he also said the population must uh go down so he wants 250 to 350\n\n(1:08:38) million people on Earth and 95% decline well who knows maybe he'll set an example one day the Georgia guide stones very interesting Stones here in the United States there they are in Georgia what are they one of the highest hilltops in Elbert County Georgia stands a huge Granite Monument engraved in eight different\n\n(1:09:00) languages on four giant stones that support the common Capstone are 10 guides or Commandments the monument is alternatively referred to as the Georgia guide stones or American Stone Edge the message is maintain Humanity under half a billion that's interesting what might happen to the rest guide reproduction\n\n(1:09:20) wisely improve Fitness unite Humanity with loving living new language rule passion Faith tradition and all things with re tempered reason protect people and nations with Fair laws let all nations rule internally resolve external disputes in a world Court avoid Petty laws balance personal rights blah blah\n\n(1:09:40) blah prize truth be not a cancer on the earth leave room for nature leave room for nature 10 rules what happens to the rest of humanity what do they want to do these people have murder in their hearts well fascinating stuff there's the original Stonehenge there's a little hole in this Georgia Stone the hole in\n\n(1:10:00) the stone was drilled in the center Stone so that the North Star which in masonry is a symbol of Lucifer could be visualized through it at any moment this was one of the several requirement stipulated by a so-called RC Christian for the building of the American Stonehenge and then it says over here the Georgia guide stones let these be\n\n(1:10:23) guid stones to an Age of Reason Age of Reason now that's an interesting statement because the Age of Reason was a book written by Thomas Payne its intent was to destroy the Judea Christian beliefs upon which the USA Republic was founded interesting stuff that's coming together well I have news for these\n\n(1:10:47) future murderers and their little plans Daniel 2:44 says and in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever what a tremendous promise\n\n(1:11:16) Malachi 35 and I will come near to you to judgment and I will be a sft witness against the sorcerers these people are Sorcerers they are worshiping Lucifer and against the adulterers and the false swearers and those that oppress the Hing in his wages the Widow the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from the right and fear not me\n\n(1:11:44) says the Lord of hosts nine testimonies Spirit of Prophecy oh that we might see the need of these cities as God see sees them at such a time as this every hand is to be employed the Lord is coming the end is near yeah it haste us greatly in a little while we shall be unable to work with the freedom that we now enjoy\n\n(1:12:08) terrible scenes are before us and what we do we must do quickly why do we sleep so even my own church how often in my own church do I hear people oh the Lord's not coming yet we have lots of time don't they have Watchmen on the wall of Zion that watch and see and look at all these things I don't believe we have a lot of time I\n\n(1:12:34) think we're this close and they know who the enemy is they've identified him it is our duty now to employ every possible means to help in the proclamation of the truth we are to work as we have never worked before the Lord is coming very soon and we are entering into scenes of calamity satanic agencies though unseen are\n\n(1:12:57) working to destroy human life I believe this woman was a prophet now is our time to work with vigilance our books and papers are to be brought to the notice of the people the gospel of present truth is to be given to our cities without delay we need to arouse to our duties I want to tell you today I'm a\n\n(1:13:20) Seventh Day Adventist because I believe with my heart that they preach the truth and I want to tell you something else I fought Hook Line and Sinker not to become a Seventh Day Adventist do you think I wanted to give up everything in the world I had everything I was a professor at the University I had this\n\n(1:13:40) that and the other I had everything I didn't want to give it up I had no choice because I checked out all the doctrines I wanted to find a way out out believe me I search to find a way out there is no way out as Roman Catholicism says it's either the one or the other they themselves say there is no other\n\n(1:14:04) choice I concur with them I was a Roman Catholic I had to switch sides and I did and I don't want to fight anyone I don't want to create War I don't want to hurt anyone I just wanted people to understand that they be saved why will you die oh House of Israel why you want to die accept the truth come out make Jesus your king\n\n(1:14:29) what's the matter with us can't we see what's happening in the world impending destruction also Spirit of Prophecy Adventist home the time is near when large cities will be swept away and all should be warned of these coming judgments oh that God's people had a sense of the impending destruction of thousands of cities now almost given\n\n(1:14:50) to idolatry well are they planning the destruction of many people yes or no and they will use it as an excuse to eliminate the others with them Daniel 7:18 but the Saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever isn't that a tremendous promise so what are we afraid of I'm not afraid\n\n(1:15:17) I have learned to trust that God will do everything that he promises and he has prom promised it it will not come near your gate he has promised it he said the plagues will fall a thousand will fall by your side 10,000 by your right hand it will not come near you internalize the promises read your Bibles read your\n\n(1:15:36) Bibles make the promises your own if you want to

word word and we will need the promises but it's not enough to read\n\n(1:15:57) them we need to believe them and for that we need a relationship you need oil pour the oil of experience into your bottles so that when the Lord comes you will be able to stand we are going home very soon and all of those who are guests here tonight I apologize for hurting many feelings I apologize profusely

  "# Title:233_signs_wonders_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nReligious Deception,Sabbath Authority,Marian Apparitions,Biblical Truth,End-time Conflict\n\n## Guide:\nThis extensive lecture by Walter Veith, titled \"Signs & Wonders _ Total Onslaught,\" delves into a profound ideological conflict between Roman Catholicism and those awaiting Christ's second coming and adhering to God's commandments. Veith asserts that deception is rampant in the world, with demonic forces using miraculous signs and wonders to mislead even the faithful. A central point of contention is the challenge to God's Word, particularly regarding the observance of the Sabbath, which the Roman Catholic Church openly admits to changing from Saturday to Sunday as a sign of its authority. Veith argues that many Catholic doctrines, including the veneration of Mary as a co-redemptrix and intercessor, the acceptance of evolution over creationism, and various miraculous apparitions, contradict biblical teachings and serve to enthrall believers when biblical support is absent. He highlights that this \"total onslaught\" is ultimately an attack on Jesus Christ and His Word, forcing individuals to choose between reliance on Sola Scriptura (the Bible as sole authority) and the traditions, signs, and pronouncements of the Catholic Church.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 233 - Signs & Wonders _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3KUCfsWpFY\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in yesterday's lectures we discussed many things which were probably quite new to many of you amongst other things the clash between the two ideologies in the world the one spearheaded by Roman Catholicism the other one spearheaded by those who are waiting for the coming of\n\n(01:27) the Lord and keep the commandments of God Matthew 24 verse 3 and 4 and as he SAT upon the Mount of Olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world and jesus answered and said unto them take heed\n\n(01:50) that no man deceive you this is a very sad text deception is going to be the order of the day and the other problem is that even the elect can be deceived so it is a very intricate width which Satan has spun upon this planet revelation 16 13 says and I saw the three evil spirits that looks like frogs\n\n(02:19) out of the mouth of the dragon the mouth of the beast in the mouth of the false prophet we've dealt with that in the previous lectures they are spirits of demons performing marrek miraculous signs and they go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty\n\n(02:36) demonic forces working amongst men to de-seed them and you only save God we have against any other is the word of God Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise false Christ's false prophets shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect so signs and wonders are\n\n(03:05) going to be an order of the day and how can we prevent ourselves and others from to see who are the elect obviously those who have made the word of God their stay and their bastiaan yesterday we discussed the 2300 day prophecy and we saw that Satan hate is the beginning of the prophecy but he hates the end of the\n\n(03:35) prophecy as much because the end reveals the people that will stand for Jesus Christ and His righteousness and we saw that Rome reissues the challenge I am pleased to hear that it's still on their website so you can pick it up yourself you are willing to do that most Christians assume that sunday is a\n\n(03:58) biblically approved day of worship the Roman Catholic Church protests that it transferred the Christian worship from the biblical Sabbath Saturday to Sunday and that to try to argue that that change was made in the Bible is both dishonest and a denial of Catholic authority if Protestantism once debate\n\n(04:18) is teaching on the Bible it should worship on Saturday so what is the Roman Catholic Church actually challenging is it challenging people or is it challenging God's Word yes it's challenging God's Word and we just happened to be caught in the middle of the battle that's all you will remember is that the Catholic Sentinel has this\n\n(04:48) article where it says people who think that the Scriptures should be the sole authority should logically become seventh-day Adventists and keep Saturday holy and of course this article on Mary online where the editor said either the Catholic Church's right or the seventh-day Adventists are right there\n\n(05:05) can be no other choice that was an amazing statement what a bummer you cannot believe it and if one chooses neither then the whole doctrine of Sola scriptura collapses alright so what's the argument about the veracity of the Word of God now it just happens to be is that the Bible predicted that a group of people\n\n(05:32) will come at the end of time and will stand on sola scriptura and will stand for the Lord as it is described in the Bible and if you choose neither then sola scriptura collapses now how does an organization that does not rely on sola scriptura how does it defend itself when it comes with false doctrine what's legs\n\n(06:00) when you take the word the way tradition and if that is not going to convince the people what do you need you need signs and wonders you made you need events that will convince people that this is the truth since 1844 we've been living in the judgment time and the judgment standard you remember that but whoso\n\n(06:25) looketh into the perfect law of Liberty and continuously in he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed so speaking and so do as I said shall be judged by the law of Liberty now there are two laws in the world today two sets of laws the one set of law is in the\n\n(06:47) Bible the other set of laws is where who made those yes Roman Catholicism and that is very strange the Bible says that you love me keep my Commandments that is a question of authority whose authority are we going to exit well obviously if you believe in sola scriptura you're going to follow the authority of the\n\n(07:16) Bible which is the authority of God Jesus Christ here's the patience of the Saints he or they that keep the commandments of God and the face of Jesus so here is this one group at the end of time case the many of Jesus you will remember that we went through that text it is the spirit of prophecy when\n\n(07:40) lecture on that so the distinguishing characteristics of God's remnant Church was that they keep the commandments and have the testimony of Jesus which is the spirit of prophecy and the Sabbath of course in the commandments of God is going to become pivotal that they might be a sign between me and them that they\n\n(08:04) may know that I and the lord who sanctifies them and not some other is they killed 2012 so here is this decision and then we looked at revelation 14 9 where the third angel follows and cried with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His image and received his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the\n\n(08:30) wine of the wrath of God so if you start thinking like him believing him or just obeying him then you are worshipping in and then this indignation will be poured out that we spoke about so this wine of the wrath of God will be poured up and there will be a terrible consequence to this action now it's dealt with us\n\n(08:57) already so I'm just briefly summing it up here before I set the stage for the two organizations the two ideologies coming into conflict as the Pope has power to change times to abrogate laws to dispense with all things even the precepts of Christ that is one of their decree tolls so obviously if you're\n\n(09:22) going to believe in sola scriptura then you will say that that is presumption that is not biblical of course the Catholic Church claims that the change was there actinic is a mark of ecclesiastical power and authority and religious matters so they say we changed it sundays are mark of authority so sabbath sunday is the clash point it's\n\n(09:49) not the question of a day as we have said it's the authority of God that's being questioned either sola scriptura or the word of another system catholicism the churches above the bible so the attack is on God and His Word we must not see this an attack as a personal attack this is an attack on God who did the devil hates more than anyone\n\n(10:17) else from the universe Christ this is an attack on Jesus Christ nothing other this is total onslaught and this transference of the Sabbath observance is proof of that fact so let's have a look at the definition of truth the law is true psalm 119 verse 142 thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness and die law is the truth\n\n(10:48) okay psalm 119 551 thou art near Oh Lord and all thy commandments are true then the word is true John 17 verse 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy Word is truth as the other definition and then Jesus is the truth John 14 verse 6 jesus said unto them I am the way is the truth and the life no man cometh unto\n\n(11:23) the father but by me what's the Jesuit catechism say the other side of the story or what if the Holy Scriptures come on one thing in the Pope another country to it the Holy Scriptures must be thrown the side we have two sets of norms in the world what is the Pope is the Vicar of Christ King of Kings a lot\n\n(11:45) of laws and is but one judgment seat belonging to god and the Pope well I'm afraid this God is not my god because my god said I change not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and for era is not going to change and definitely is not going to allow his vicar the row the Holy Scriptures aside is he going to do that I have my doubts\n\n(12:10) whether we like it or not the whole world is in one camp all in the other camp now remember that the Mary is the mediatrix in Catholicism 1854 the pub declared Mary Immaculate 1951 profiles defined and enforced the doctrine of the bodily assumption of mary and the doctrine basically goes that the sinners\n\n(12:36) adventures directly to christ may come with great an apprehension of his rocks but lady money employ the mediation of the virgin with her son and she has only to show this on the breasts that gave him suckin Ishrat will immediately both be appease there was a terrible statement is that Catholicism came up\n\n(12:54) with and these are the statements by the Roman Catholic saints he falls and his last two as not recourse to marry meri's called the gate of heaven see there they like this word gate Jesus says i am the gate here Mary's made the gate because no one can enter into that blessed Kingdom without passing through her now\n\n(13:19) didn't Jesus say the opposite the way to salvation is open to none otherwise then through Mary the salvation of all depends on their being favored and protected by Mary here is protected by Mary will be saved you is not will be lost our salvation depends on the God will not save us without the intercession of Mary the Bible says\n\n(13:41) there is but one intercessor between man and God the man Christ Jesus isn't that right you see the two ideologies are not in line with each other Jesus is being marginalized in the world ridiculed the word is ridiculed every aspect of the word just think of it the scientific aspect of the word is it ridiculed in\n\n(14:04) the world today is enough absolutely the archaeological evidence in the world is it ridiculed in the world today absolutely what about the historical aspects of the word are they being really q yes what about the Salvation aspects of the world are they being ridiculed yes everything is being ridiculed your\n\n(14:26) ridiculed in fact they're making it as hard as possible for someone to say so last clip Teela and not be denigrated to the lunatic fringe is all right if you say God created in six days sermons are not didn't they what I say believe me they say Jesus Christ plain and simple well Mary quite a different story\n\n(14:58) interesting that she has all these hammers and things around us all these Masonic symbols but while in the Most Blessed Virgin the church has already reached that perfection whereby she exists without spot or wrinkle the faithful still strive to conquer some an increase in holiness and so they turn their eyes to marry in her the church is\n\n(15:20) already all holy this is not an ordinary source this is the official Roman Catholicism Catholic catechism article 8 to 9 devotion to the Blessed Mary 971 article all generations will call me blessed the church's devotion to the Blessed mirek is intrinsic to Christian worship the church rightly honors the\n\n(15:42) Blessed version was special devotion from the most ancient times to the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of Mother of God what are these most ancient times if this was a Christian documentation they say at least since the Christian era yes or no oh no this is from the most ancient times though they're really honoring\n\n(16:08) Isis Isis for Diana whatever you want to call it protection the face will fly in all their dangers our needs so they go to marry this very special devotion this is essentially from the adoration which is given to incarnate word and equally to the father and the holy spirit and greatly phosphors this ad\n\n(16:29) eration the literal chief dedicated to the mother of god and marian prayer such as the rosary an epitome of the whole gospel expresses this devotion to the Virgin Mary and this hasn't been retyped I scanned that in from the Catechism that's exactly what the Catechism says in the meantime the mother of Jesus in\n\n(16:55) the glory which he possesses in body and soul in heaven is the image and the beginning of the church I thought the church was the body of Christ didn't know what the Bible says as it is to be perfected in the world to come like why she shines forth on earth until the day of the Lord shall come a sign of certain\n\n(17:14) hope and comfort to the pilgrim people of God they are two helps here so the Pope officially honors Mary in this issue Protestant says Mary so contrary but what do they do say obey the papal decree so who are they really obeying Jesus Christ or their deity everywhere in the world the huge statues of Mary\n\n(17:43) are going up five hundred thousand pilgrims wait for the Madonna how to believe in miracles and they are Marion shrines all over the world that's one over here in Austria and you go to it and you see all these things hanging over their crutches and what have you people that supposedly have been healed\n\n(18:05) by me read this to a Catholic man over here has just said 'yes confession that was Marian shrine and there it says Maria garrison mary has helped and depending on how many cindy has they are various crosses in this little church and you pick one of these up and then you say penance that way so if you have\n\n(18:29) committed a small sin you'll pick up a little cross and you'll walk once or twice around the church if you've committed a big thing you pick up a big one and you walk 15 times around is that biblical no it's not biblical but Marian movement is incredibly powerful this one of the years since Maximilian Maria Colbert is the founder\n\n(18:52) of the Knights of the Immaculata and the aim this priesthood aim is to further the cause of Mary here is a fascinating story about Mary's visions that she has brought about the woman Eve had a decisive role in the fall of mankind through her disobedience to God and desire to exalt herself the woman mary\n\n(19:19) has a decisive role in the salvation of mankind through her obedience to God doesn't stir in the gospel upside down purple the six in his 1967 encyclical signal magnum identified the Lady of Fatima as the biblical representation of the woman clothed with the Sun okay this is where the class started coming in\n\n(19:43) Mary said in a vision of Fatima she said I am the Virgin of Revelation now that's the one side the other side that we looked at said the Virgin of Revelation is who the church the church that keeps the commandments of God and holds to the testimony of Jesus both God be right absolutely not the relation 14-6 and I\n\n(20:13) saw another angel fly limits from heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people there will be a people that will represent Jesus Christ saying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him masc for the hour of his judgment is\n\n(20:35) come and worship Him that made heaven and earth to sea and The Fountains of water so this organization says God is the creator Catholic Church says Genesis is nonsense it's official the Catholic Church has officially debunked the literal interpretation of the creation according to Genesis as utter nonsense here Vatican thinking\n\n(21:05) evolves this was time magazine's the Pope gives he's placing to natural selection the man's soul remains beyond science of three two ideologies so I'm saying God yellow I'm saying that's rubbish what's he doing to the Word of God he's saying the word of God is utter nonsense well pops Johanna's Paul fly or\n\n(21:31) the people had documentation and the deed the Bible is wrong after all so he says in Auto vittore Romana which is the official mouthpiece of the Roman Catholic Church that Darwinism is right and the Bible is wrong here is on Street Journal this magazine and they're having a interview here with a Jesuit console\n\n(22:06) marginal likes to point up that creationism is a 19th century Protestant heresy it's not interesting the ancient church fathers knew better than to interpret the Bible that way the Jesuits got their first telescope of the galileo published his extraordinary findings that Jupiter had four moons etc etc so\n\n(22:28) the Roman Catholic Church doesn't believe us here they asked him aren't you guys creationist know it's a 19th century Protestant heresy now I want you to think are you all with me on this when it rotten Scism arrived 16th century writer on all right then wiser the 19th century Protestant Harrison from when to when was the 19th\n\n(23:08) century from 1800 to 1900 right what date sort of fits nicely in the middle there 1844 somewhere maybe using why should this be a 19th century Protestant era see this is a Jesuit speaking they know exactly who their problem child is that's interesting Protestantism well here you have a Protestant church this\n\n(23:35) is a Calvinistic church now symbol of the Sun there Sun symbol on the window that's still okay outside is this plaque over here where it has these petrified stones and it says these stones are 250 million years old and does Protestantism support officially creation or does it support evolution you tell me it\n\n(24:05) supports evolution every main Synod of every Protestant church in the world has officially accepted as the evolution account as somehow to be incorporated in the biblical accounts they were the problem the Dutch Reformed Church also officially did it well here I am in the biggest Protestant church in Switzerland\n\n(24:35) it's a the f'n gala shiki a chip for those who understand German some nice flex over here and some nice posters along the walls interesting one and there is their creator who's that this is Brahma breathing in and Brahma breathing out now this is an amazing story I was invited to give a series on evolution creation in Switzerland\n\n(25:08) and they happen to hire this whole just because it was a nice hole was just a hired hall from the FN gala shakya on evolution creation and the Flyers went out and everybody was invited and then on the day before the lecture started the pastor of this institution came to us and he asked the question he said\n\n(25:37) what you know I never really thought about this but what are you going to say are you going to say that God created or are you going to support evolution what you're going to do and I said no we're going to show that God created and he said well that's it sorry you cannot have the whole anymore we canceling the\n\n(26:01) whole way well that's very interesting you see because we have a contract we paid to rent your hall and we have sent thousands of fliers up that costs a lot of money and you are cancelling the hall well then you're going to be in trouble because then you will have to pick up all those costs and see to it that\n\n(26:23) everybody who has been invited will be able to go to another end you that's only fair you're going to cancel the wall because of that so they went into a huddle with much steam rising from their heads and eventually they solve the problem they said okay you can keep the hole and you can give your lectures but\n\n(26:43) before every lecture you have to announce that the organization to whom this whole belongs the effing gala shakya officially dispatch ii eight sit self from the creation account so i said with pleasure and before every lecture I said I would just like to tell you that the organization leave and educate you\n\n(27:10) officially distances itself from the creation account I guess my lecture and after the lectures two people fit much why and I said well you'll have to ask them then you'll have to ask them that because there is their creator Brahma breathed in Rama Prasad unbiblical doctrines of Rome are dealt with them\n\n(27:32) already infant baptism sprinkling state of the Dead immortality prayers to the Dead repetitive prayer and forgiveness of sins he'll place and state in which the devils and such human beings as dying enmity with God suffer eternal torment to Catholic literally page 395 this is the reason why I was not used\n\n(27:54) because of that statement I was an atheist we'll have to look at that in the next lecture indulgences you can buy yourself free the mass a mission of the cup council of constance sunday worship scripture index of prohibited books by Paul the sixth in the 1599 Archbishop alphonsus in 1462 broke up the printing\n\n(28:19) establishment of the Gutenberg and Shiva so which books are still prohibited the Textus Receptus is still a prohibited book you have to accept their versions pre tourism is a Jesuit doctrine the Antichrist was only party was a little Greek insignificant King and futurism the Antichrist will come in the future\n\n(28:45) higher criticism carrying the Bible apart these are all Roman Catholic doctrine they all emanate from Rome 1854 Mary Immaculate eight 1951 the assumption of mary and all the terrible statements that go along with it Luke 11 27 28 and it came to pass as he spoke these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said\n\n(29:11) unto Him blessed is the womb that bore thee and the paps which thou has they said to Jesus but he said yay rather blessed are they that hear the word of God and keep it why did Jesus rebuke ax because what he was uttering was a Babylonian fable that's what she was uttering and Jesus said no the word\n\n(29:36) of God and obedience that's the criterium not some celestial miss pagan priesthood of the Bell they were celibate they were ton jet that means they were cut over here like some monks tour are to this very day the Commission they received the power of sacrificing for the living and the dead can you sacrifice for either of them Hebrews 10\n\n(30:05) 14 because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy in fact there is not one biblical doctrine in the whole of physiology so how do they solve this problem well listen to what to see a lodge and Carla Rana he's currently as the head of the congregation of doctrine and safe that\n\n(30:27) means the head of the Inquisition at the moment and he has pointed up that we are moved much more readily and effectively by those divine interventions that we call apparitions then by abstract teachings of knowledgeable theologian or the hierarchy of the church Wow fascinating so what moves us apparition\n\n(30:54) they move us teachings of clo Joseph let's let's forget that so if you don't have the Bible or you have corrupted the Bible well then that's all you have left that's all you have left and so we've had amazing Marian apparition in the world these are the Marian apparitions that have been approved by the catholic\n\n(31:19) church our lady of guadalupe 1531 approved our lady of guadalupe means she who crushes the serpent is not interesting she crushes the serpent who crushes a serpent Jesus crushes the serpent then this one's fascinating because I the date is so interesting 1846 now I sort of get a little bit excited when I see these days\n\n(31:46) laughs electron it was approved by the church and she said Lucifer was unleashed in 1864 very interesting or she said he will be unleashed then more or less whatever Lord France 1858 approved I am the Immaculate Conception that's a blatant lie the only one who was without sin was Jesus no one else the Bible says she was a woman under the\n\n(32:24) law which means she was under the same condemnation of the law as everyone else she was sinful but her son was not and then punk man France 1871 that's also been approved fatima portugal 1917 has also been approved Mary calling herself queen of the rosary and the three children Lucia Francisco Jacinta lucia\n\n(32:56) would live to see the fulfillment of all the messages a very very old lady and then the Belgium apparition 1932-33 approved I am the mother of god the Queen of Heaven pray always here we have Isis re-inspected then we have got a bundle Spain 1961 a key time Japan 1973 approved by the local bishop migori of\n\n(33:26) the former Yugoslavia and present she's the queen of peace now these are interesting phenomenon the thunder of Justice Ted and more influence Fatima was the most second apparition for the early part of the 20th century rajagiriya is meeting the spiritual needs of this generation interesting in the latter part of the\n\n(33:53) century he's eminence joseph cardinal ratzinger now you know that is one uh has stated in the rap singer report one of the signs of our times is that the announcement of the Marian apparitions are multiplying all over the world so the owner of the Bible you better have something out 1950 the renounced\n\n(34:17) Catholic judgment Archbishop Fulton sheen wrote we are living in the days of the Apocalypse the last days of our era the two great forces of the mystical body of Christ and the mystical body of the Antichrist are beginning to draw up their battle lines for the catastrophic contest now we looked at this contest\n\n(34:42) yesterday from our point of view the biblical point of view now we're going to look at it from whose point of view their point of view the Catholic that's only fair you can must be able to choose right you have a right of choice of here we've seen there is the biblical accounts of what's going to happen the\n\n(35:04) woman in white she keeps the commandments of god yells to the testimony of Jesus she's going to arrive 18 after 1844 going to be organized and she's going to oppose everything that is happening in the world were the three angels messages on the loud cry we did that yesterday Reggie dumb now who does\n\n(35:26) that organization that we dealt with yesterday the seventh-day adventist church who do they say is the Antichrist Catholicism Catholicism who did the Reformers say was the Antichrist Catholicism every single one every single one said the same thing why because they changed the word of God now who do you think they will think is the\n\n(35:55) Antichrist obviously someone else beginning to draw up their battle lines for the catastrophic context here comes a contest but this contest is one that we just caught in the middle of its really a contest against Jesus and His Word and if I see that well then I'm actually a piece because i'm going to\n\n(36:19) worry about how do i get on i am now announcing to you that this is the time of the decisive battle thanks what Mary said so we said the Bible teaches us by all the signs that we've discussed that we're at the end we're at the battle line mary says in ad well Commerce says exactly the same thing I'm announcing to\n\n(36:46) you that this is the time of the decisive battle publio had a vision of a confrontation between God and Satan publio was made to understand that Satan would be allowed one hundred years to attempt to try to destroy the church in the vision Satan chose for his 100 years the 20th century center think he's full\n\n(37:12) of furious activity for he knows that his time is short now if you know anything about occult ism who did they say Satan really is what we are called to say he's Satan yah they me al Jesus is Satan so Christ will have a shot at the Catholic Church for that way around in the 20th century anything thank you\n\n(37:43) la salette let's go back to the 1846 approve Lucifer was unleashed 1864 is the quote in the thunder of justice 10 more influenced by the way Malachi Martin wrote the forward to that book so this is not just any old book so the seventh-day adventist church was officially formed in 1863 seventh-day adventist church was organized in 1863\n\n(38:13) with 3,500 members half a dozen local conferences about 30 ministerial laborers and a general conference committee of three well that's kind of interesting just just an interesting fact now let's have a look what La Salette fraud said the issue would be that would be interesting wouldn't it alright Mary said if my people do not\n\n(38:41) wish to submit themselves this is the La Salette apparition if my people do not wish to submit themselves i'm forced to let go of the hand of my son it is so heavy and weighs me down so much I can no longer keep hold of it I have suffered all the time for the rest of you if you do not wish my son to abandon\n\n(39:02) you I must take it upon myself to pray for this continually and the rest of you think little of this in vain you will pray in vain ewell act you will never be able to make up for the troubles i have taken over for the rest of you i gave you six days to work I have kept the servants for myself and no one wishes to\n\n(39:24) grant it to me this is what weighs down the arm of my son so much wow what was the issue that La Salette said would be the problem the Sabbath but now which service if you are on the seventh day adventist side which one is the Sabbath the seventh day would be saturday according to the Bible if you are on the\n\n(39:57) so called Mary's side then which one would you propagate obviously sundial now isn't it interesting that la salette says Satan will be unleashed now and this is an issue would you find that interesting all coincidental or whatever papayas in his encyclical letter of august 15 1854 said is the absurd and erroneous\n\n(40:25) doctrines or ravings and defense of liberty of conscience or a most pestilential error a pest of all others must most to be dreaded in a state the same Pope in his encyclical letter december eight 1864 and nasmyth eyes those who assert the liberty of conscience and the religious worship also all such as maintained that the\n\n(40:47) church may not employ fourth well who started doing that publicly in that date well when was the seventh-day Adventist Church constitutive 1864 and as a consequence of their actions these encyclical letters were started to be written that we discussed yesterday Catholic visionaries and prediction that\n\n(41:17) is a topic we need to discuss in some detail so we've seen the backgrounds now the battle lines are drawn two groups coming up the one group standing for the commandments of God and the Word of God and the centrality of Jesus Christ the other group standing for signs and wonders miracles commandments of the\n\n(41:45) church and apparitions as support because there's no biblical support and we have to make a choice this is the book the thunder of justice the warning new miracle the chastisement Ted and Maureen Flynn forward by Malachi Martin let's just read this forward quickly it's very interesting the thunder of\n\n(42:06) Justice only a very distracted and unaware Christian of today could have avoided receiving at least a fleeting impression of the long hot summer 1993 that for a number of years now there has been a steady buildup of events in the broadest sense of that world all of which indicate that humanity as a whole and the Holy Roman\n\n(42:28) Catholic Church in particular have reached the faithful threshold beyond which lies a new condition of human affairs is interesting style well Malachi Martin professor Pontifical University claims have been an ex Jesuit but is of course fully Roman Catholic there's no such thing as makes Jesuit but never like this is stolen their\n\n(42:52) visions appearances messages predictions warnings interpretations weeping statues bleeding icons miraculous spring water spontaneous cures spinning dances of the Sun eclipses of the Moon little children telling the future uneducated men and women instructing Pope's and presidents nationwide publicity to us by bearers of\n\n(43:14) special revelation throughout all of this and obvious emphasis on the singular role of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth as the Queen of Heaven mother of all the living and not surprisingly as the Mediatrix of all graces is pervasive we're interesting but such exhausting see is soberly contrasted with the other side of the\n\n(43:40) centuries carnage for this is the century that has witnessed and he stole witnessing scenes of unmitigated horrors dustrial slaughter of bland walls literally millions of men and women and children killed the wiping out sometimes as it were the night of mighty empires and ever widening ripple of infanticide\n\n(43:59) running to Welliver billion in the last 50 years and ever climbing number of fracas Idol was 245 at the date of the writing are in progress waves of tortures and prostitutions on all five continents continuous stream of natural disasters without known parallel in human history as we know it this world\n\n(44:19) scene is over hand by a generalized economic depression and the clear emergent of an yet skeletal one-world government that is profession release secular frightened Lee dangerous for human Liberty and ending up blind resembles George Orwell's portraits of a big brother in his 1984 scenario truth panera mixed together so starting in\n\n(44:44) 1973 a certain father goby began to write down interior locutions that's dictated messages God doesn't work like that he impresses with the spirit and the prophets wrote down with their own words but the number are over 600 published in this book priests are lady beloved sons and basically the message\n\n(45:08) says be faithful to the Pope total obedience to his commands ready to fight even to the shedding of their blood in order to remain united team and faithful to the gospel is he recognized by the Pope absolutely there is Pope John Paul's to and father Gobi what does he have to say he said September eighteen\n\n(45:32) nineteen eighty-eight is that we have a period of ten years ten decisive years in this period of kenya's they will come to a completion the time of the Great Tribulation which has been foretold you in the Holy Scriptures in this period of ten years all the secrets which I have revealed to some of my children will\n\n(45:49) come to pass while September eighteen nineteen eighty-eight to September eighteen nineteen ninety-eight is the time period which he said by September 1998 the papacy had every encyclical in place that is needed including its sunday encyclical which came before that date and including its add to ending\n\n(46:14) fiddle which says heretics must be punished if they do not agree with a papal teaching everything was in place in other words the world is just waiting for the unfolding of the final event a lost dogma that will be declared is that Mary is Cody dentrix Mediatrix and that means she takes part in our salvation\n\n(46:38) one scholar remarks that the title advocate is used almost exclusively for Mary and not for the Saints it is particularly appropriate to merely that's interesting because the Bible says that there is one man that can save us an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous does it say Mary they know so here's\n\n(47:01) another biblical problem Cardinal Ratzinger reportedly has written a visionary that there are no theological barriers to proclaiming such a dogma so Mary is the contrary one she is courage and tricks mediatrix of all grace as an advocate of the people of God one statement to make that's demoting Jesus\n\n(47:24) Christ so all of a sudden in this time period a huge explosion of activity we find many many sightings of so-called UFOs we find strange things happening patterns in the field some of them fake some of them not explicable we have apparitions in Eastern mysticism we have apparitions in Western mysticism shreena\n\n(47:50) mutti and Krishna this was the one who was supposed to be declared the Messiah but now matreya has taken his place in Islam you have fruits and vegetables when they're cut open at the name of Allah in them in Iran it is reported in various parts of the city that an image of Jesus has been on the fences and\n\n(48:10) windows so writes the Iranian newspaper Akbar in 25 December 1995 insight on Egypt Mary apparitions hovered over the churches and thousands and thousands of Muslims were stunned by the statues started bleeding for the honesty of a Greek Orthodox was one of the first to see it in this lady over here Hamida and\n\n(48:36) Muslim she saw the tears running down the statues and she said he was beautiful so beautiful Benjamin cream came onto the scene with hizmet Reyes stories and then matreya started appearing and so we have had images of Mary and we have had light emanating from Japanese botsa vatta images Hindu milk miracles Muslim miracles hosts and\n\n(49:01) hosts of miracles suddenly all over the world and we're thus matreya appears the water gets Ripley and here in Northern all Germany they're running to fetch the water to be healed crosses appeared in the windows crosses that stayed there permanently strange lights appeared on the statues of matreya in in eastern\n\n(49:25) temple interesting hand signals that they have these people these lights were not there there was no candle or a light burning it was just on the Buddha's and then Lord Ganesha started drinking milk and those statues in in Hinduism they started holding Luke to them and the most would just go strip God well I\n\n(49:50) always say Lord Ganesha had better attend one of our two of my health lectures and here's another little statue drinking milk and so the Hindus were feeding look to all their statues a little girl has not Muslim girl started crying real crystal tears she was investigated by doctors strange apparitions in the rocks of mysticism in\n\n(50:20) your countenance the white buffalo cards were born in 1994 in 1996 fulfilling Native American prophecies the odds of such an aberration estimated at six to ten million to one all these things saying we are coming to the close of time Vatican to this is the door commemorating Vatican 2 which had stated\n\n(50:43) that all churches can stay what they are provided they accept papal supremacy and remember that Don Bosco had predicted that the gospel ship would land between the two pillars of Catholicism the Eucharist and Mary one year before the close of the century so one year before the close of the century 1999 they had the ecumenical movement\n\n(51:12) where the Pope was declared the spiritual leader of the world it went into fulfillment whether we like it or not Mary was ready to be made goddess millions of Catholics want a godly Mary and the papal dogma maria's our gut in Verdun well was approved at least verbally by the Pope Our Lady of Guadalupe 1994 the icon started weeping\n\n(51:44) oil and strange lights started coming down in Guadeloupe which was supposedly the Shekinah glory and many religions start worshiping Mary with all these apparitions all over the world Mary supplants the Earth Mother in Indian rituals guate lupe stage this was the famous dancing of the Sun that took place in Fatima and there water gushes\n\n(52:18) forth and millions and millions and millions of people go to these shrines to be healed and they go into the water to be healed now this is a very strange teaching and we find it also in the Bible where at the pool of Batista there lay a man and as the theory went in their minds that when the pool was moved\n\n(52:42) by the angel of the Lord and somebody happens to be in the pool then that someone would be healed and people are saying that verse should never be in the Bible well that verse was absolutely be in the Bible because the angel of the Lord swirling the water and someone by chance being in there was their mindset\n\n(53:04) this is Babylonian religion since Babylonian religion but the angel of the Lord in human form was amongst them Jesus Christ and he went into that situation and what did he do he went to the man lying there all those years are crippled and he said to him come let me help you into the water I am the angel of the Lord becomes\n\n(53:32) flesh and he carried him into the water waited 12 it and put him inside right no that's not the biblical story at all he rebuked their ideology their fable beliefs because God doesn't work like this to favor this one or favour that one by a chance twirling and if you're lucky enough to be in the water at that\n\n(53:56) time so be it we don't have to go on a pilgrimage to be saved no your rebuke that he went to the man and he said you want to be saved you want to be made whole yes get up pick up your bed and walk and it was on the Sabbath day what does tumult Jesus calls taking away all of this rubbish in one miracle well Mary\n\n(54:20) is being honored more than Jesus that's for sure this is all you ever sees above doing and then when this Roe versus Wade situation was here in the states with the abortion issue France exploded this nuclear device and in the cloud there was something like someone on the cross and the apparition of mary looking down\n\n(54:46) upon the cross and these are the little children of God abundance pain lolly and Jacinta in ecstasy down here lying invision notice their eyes are closed very interesting all kinds of interesting things little children envisioned the message is warned that the people of the earth are floundering in a morass of debauchery moral\n\n(55:11) confusion deep spiritual darkness should heavens directions and councils go unheeded the Eternal Father in the Trinity will be left with no alternative but to forcefully recall mankind to its obligations through chastisements there will come great turmoil upon this earth now isn't it strange that the world is\n\n(55:32) permitted to do everything that's wrong abortion and percent that and the only voice that sounds morality happens to be which one which is the only church up there that's loudly saying every time no no no you should not do that so from so all the afflictions move towards Rome and only get our Bibles they're looking\n\n(55:57) at miracles signs and wonders and the deceptive voice the vasila was started receiving automatic handwriting God doesn't work like that he doesn't take your hand and dictate you that's how many of the New Age writings come into existence here is a interview with father lauren teen was mashallah how do\n\n(56:19) you receive the messages it is dictated but you said your hands moved in some way yes it is simultaneously at first he moves my hand without dictating and then etcetera etcetera etcetera and then Mary said they will be a sign this former yugoslavian majha gora mary has been appearing and giving a messages to the\n\n(56:40) world which it says there will be a fine given for the atheists you faithful already have signs and you have become the sign of the eighth year so there will be some kind of permanent sign these are the little children of magic gorda who were allowed to see the vision december seven 1974 Mary revealed to\n\n(57:00) father go be why she chooses the little one I the mother of the church i'm personally intervening and initiating my work of salvation i'm initiating advice with simplicity with hidden lists and such humble manner that most people will not even be aware of it but this is my this my son has always been the way your\n\n(57:22) mother has acted with what hiddenness that's an interesting phenomenon hiddenness what's the last book of the Bible call revelation those are two characters in opposition one to the other the ones called hidden list the Bible calls her Mystery Babylon the Great and the other one is revelation God wants you to know Fatima gotta bundle\n\n(57:51) magic or a Argentina Jesus supposedly said my mother must be accepted my mother must be heard in her totality of her messages souls will come to me through the means of her Immaculate Heart Jesus is taking a back street magic or a visionaries there are little apparitions over there of Mary there are\n\n(58:14) other apparitions this one over here was in Arizona a man saw Busch with full of flowers his wife's didn't see any flower story/photograph stood for her and when they developed it they went out loud but there was Mary of the Rosary behind the bush another apparition lights appearing above churches magically Mary's image\n\n(58:39) appearing above the two peoples of the church like screaming from our hands standing on the moon that's the basic image that is always appearing strange flashes of light everywhere strange apparitions in the in the clouds some of them very clear like this one over here Jesus with a crown of thorns face\n\n(59:01) appearing above these sites strange lights where people walk pillars of light this woman standing next to a pillar of light which doesn't exist some francis is another one who regularly appears roommate of loyola where the youths comes together at these sites these strange lights appear in the sky crosses appear in the sky apparitions\n\n(59:26) appear and where they appear the roses bloom in the middle of winter very strange things all these lights coming down from heaven like fire passing right through people but only way you can see this property there's the uncouple standing over there and there's a light going like an arrow through a Bible or\n\n(59:50) something they have in their hand right through and then where they have their their meeting these lights appear in the sky with writing sometimes here like fire at on the attendance and here you have fire and lights coming down on the delegates and entering into them that you see these things what would you imagine\n\n(1:00:14) these are really phenomenal things happening here are visions of writings in the sky and strange apparitions all over the place where the young people gather little apparitions of Mary appearing this was a volcano and it was Madonna and Child and this was taken out of an aeroplane Jesus walking in the\n\n(1:00:40) cloud guardian angels above children writing Jacinta was one of the visionaries writing appeared in the sky in 1972 some of these are being interpreted pictures like these taking this is one of the monks of the area in his monk dress apparently riding a stairway to heaven this is weird stuff here is a escalator in a department\n\n(1:01:09) store after it was closed taken by the survey camera of Mary's riding the escalators it's a silly stuff but it gets worse it gets worse here is Jesus in a tornado and then the weeping statues blood and oil and water this one over here is a very interesting statue this is the one of the Philippines in\n\n(1:01:40) 1993 of this blood pouring from the face and here you have petals rose petals that fall from the sky and these structures of Jesus as king of Mary were the light streaming from our eyes of the whole families of God marry again here is the face of Jesus look there's his nose his eyes and Jesus with this sign\n\n(1:02:11) grown into the road not just gone onto the road and these fall from the sky in the Philippines on Marian day that is fall from the sky and they're very treasured you have the cross and the women around the cross on the rose petal another one was a two women on the cross these are rose petals that fall from the sky very\n\n(1:02:32) convincing to people that do not have the Bible the father will inflict a terrible punishment of all humanity fire will fall from the sky will wipe out a great part of humanity is the devil expecting some major catastrophes great lights will appear here are some more weeping statues this is one with oil\n\n(1:02:57) weeping and Las Vegas Nevada USA an hour of the midnight prayer vigil began on December 1998 the miracle statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe again it began again to eat real tears she cried again the following afternoon at two and two-thirty p.m. tearful statue called the weeping virgin of Las Vegas that's a\n\n(1:03:19) good time to weep in one ok so they really know how to perform these things periodically the statue starts weeping this statue over here belongs to a lady called Julia Kim and she is one of the present-day stigma tests of the Roman Catholic Church do you all know what a stigma trustees stigmatised is someone\n\n(1:03:42) who bleeds by the hands or has the marks of Christ or bleeds by the feet or suffers the agonies of Christ for the sins of the world and this is one of her statues also this one over here a statue of Christ which started bleeding real blood they've added analyze the great stigma terry's of the world this one was\n\n(1:04:08) one of the most famous ones of modern times her name was today's an omen she lived from eighteen ninety eight to nineteen sixty-two in Germany they say she never ate slept nor drank she had no bodily function for 40 years that means she never went to the toilet and she only lived on the Eucharist now\n\n(1:04:29) is true I don't know professor and she said great natural disasters will come in the United States here she is in her stigmatic agonies noticed the blood running out of her eyes running down from her hand and then she would have burnt in crosses after that event another famous stigmatise was Padre Pio\n\n(1:04:53) of Italy 1887 to 1968 and he said it would be easier for the world to exist without the Son and the Holy Sacrifice of the mass there he is bleeding by the hand and here is being helped while he's saying the mass and in Rome itself many of the statues with hosts started bleeding and the host developed blood\n\n(1:05:17) and when they said the mass as the host itself turned into blood this was one in 1991 there is another one that turned to bloody is another one that turned into a blood clot as they said the mat here is a priest investigating one of the hosts and then the most amazing thing happened the Pope himself was saying max and he\n\n(1:05:42) fed the host to Julia Kim de stigmatise and there he is pub John Paul to giving mass to Julia Kim the stigmatised and they took the photographs as the host was on her tongue and the newspaper said popstar hostia blue team folks all the hosts believe there's the picture it turned into a clot of blood in her mouth\n\n(1:06:11) that's pretty dramatic and the question is is this from the arteries was from another sort very dramatic if you were a Roman Catholic and you saw this happening and this was what religion was all about well it would be convincing here is the Virginia she's the stigmatise this priest is also a stigmatised she lives in Ireland was\n\n(1:06:39) young woman over here and she suffers terribly there was feet of bleeding and her hands of bleeding she also gets the same things on ahead so Julia Kim is a present-day stigmatise and Christina Gallagher is another present-day stigmatise here Julia Kim is blessed by the Pope here is she receives a medal from the Pope she's also a\n\n(1:07:05) visionary so she has these visions for the Roman Catholic Church here she is with the papal Nancy Oh Julia Kim and there she is with the man with the unfortunate name cardinal sin from the philippine in 1992 so these are not just an important figures in Roman Catholicism these are people blessed by the Pope honored by the Pope with medals\n\n(1:07:33) these are important figures this woman over here is Catalina from Bolivia and she lived in Bolivia South America and she suffers terribly when she gets the stigmata of feet swell up a hand swell up and she is then the bedridden wherever she receives the stigmata statues start bleeding and blood starts\n\n(1:08:01) pouring down from any crucifix that hangs in the area this woman was also from the United Kingdom she also received automatic writing she used to receive the stigmata she became very very ill and then she died as the consequence this again is Christina Gallagher so she has the marks of the crown of thorns this woman over here is\n\n(1:08:25) sister Anna ally of Nigeria so currently there's a stigmatised on every continent it's very interesting every continent in the world today has a stigmatised in the Roman Catholic Church something that has never been in Catholic history this one over here to me is the worst one Mary of Damascus the statues of here start\n\n(1:08:49) bleeding and some of them most of them drip oil and they've analyzed the oil it's pure olive oil but this is the young girl that receives the stigmata in this area her name is Merlin azuz and she lives in Damascus and she suffers terribly when she has the stigmata I want you to look at this young girl she's a very pretty young\n\n(1:09:14) lady licious that's what she looks like normally and when she gets the stigmata she starts bleeding from the forest and then when after a while she starts looking like that now this is very impressive but I have a question if Jesus died once for all for all our sins is it necessary for anyone else to\n\n(1:09:39) suffer the pains of the crucifixion in order to atone for the sins of the world yes or no no it's not biblical so if it's not biblical who's doing this to this poor lady can only be Satan I hate what he does why should these poor people be so deceived why should they suffer like this for nothing when the\n\n(1:10:04) truth could set them free you see I'm not preaching this against Catholics I was a Catholic myself I wish every single Catholic in the world would listen to these lectures I wish every single Catholic in the world could be set free from signs and wonders and apparitions and lies and deceitful disgusting doctrines which lead to\n\n(1:10:28) nothing other than death why should they be so to see she bleeds from the feet she bleeds from the hands is that fair is that right and the icons of oil well there's our social analyses it's the purest form of olive oil that there is they cannot even extract that pure if they have it otherwise done this is\n\n(1:10:52) another young girl stock Lara she doesn't have two stigmata but she goes into great agony and pure olive oils pause out of her skin three hard to explain with new green and that's the oil that comes out it's also been Anna I crosses all over the place people supposedly heels millions standing in queues for water then in 1996 CNN at a\n\n(1:11:21) news flash that the Virgin Mary appeared in the front window of a building in Florida and it was a bank amazingly enough and there it is a permanent picture of Mary and these are the crowds adoring around this area now when it first appeared Catholics started praying the rosary and they started speaking in\n\n(1:11:48) tongue anybody who walks by started speaking in tongue and here is a young woman being converted to Catholicism and this bubble appeared above which was the rosary just appearing miraculously taken in 1998 in Georgia of myself and a recent convert named Joel from Taylorsville she was converted to Catholicism the grace of God by the\n\n(1:12:16) intervention of our Heavenly Mother this picture was taken off to a talk I gave in Atlanta was praying over her and her medals when a rosary in the shape of art appeared between us in the picture so these are the Marian apparitions and the stigmata that are happening in the world where by Catholicism gets credence as\n\n(1:12:39) having the stamp of approval from heaven this is a summary of all the Marian predictions she says so John Paul to will be the last before the final event that's interesting you know the devil was a liar from the beginning so I don't take any of the predictions too seriously I wouldn't you know bet my\n\n(1:12:59) life on them but surely if the devil has put up so much hype than so much energy to deceive people then some of these things are actually so planned that they will more or less work out sometimes he makes a mistake the new Pope's will be eliminated by an islamic converts bishop who declares himself what we have seen that yet I don't know\n\n(1:13:25) whether it will happen or not the New World Order will come there will be a chastisement I think that might be trying to explain the place that will fall once he has done what he's done true Pope restored Church will rain and the coming of Christ well I believe there will be a death decree in there somewhere so the doctrine is not\n\n(1:13:45) biblical it's all upside down and Mary is to be the prophetess of the last time the Immaculate Conception the mother of the church the new Eve the Queen of Heaven the Assumption the Holy Rosary all of the tree dentrix mediatrix advocate everything that Jesus is supposed to be she is Rome does not change wrong today is as conservative\n\n(1:14:10) even more so than it has ever been and you can check every doctrine in the Catholic catechism and you will see it the church the pillar and bulwark of truth has received the solemn command of Christ from the apostle's to announce the saving truth to the church belongs the right always and everywhere to\n\n(1:14:30) announce moral plans principles including those pertaining to the social order and to making judgments on any human affairs to the extent that they required by fundamental rights of human persons or the salvation of soul the Magisterium of the pastors and the moral matters is ordinarily exercised in the\n\n(1:14:50) catechesis in preaching etc from generation to generation the fastest deposit of Christian moral teaching has been handed on a deposit composed of a characteristic body of rules Commandments and virtues proceeding from facing Christ so traditionally the Decalogue sets out the principles of moral life valid for all men now let's\n\n(1:15:17) get to the hub of this matter ever since this is article 2065 from the Catechism ever since since Augustine who as we saw was a insider initiative initiate the Ten Commandments have occupied the predominant place and the catechesis of baptismal Kent candidates okay as the Catechism of the church has often\n\n(1:15:43) expanded Christian morality by following the order of the Ten Commandments the division and numbering of the commandments has varied in the course of history the prison catechism follows the division of Commandments established by whom send Augustine so we're not following the Bible we're following and\n\n(1:16:02) insider initial mission the world it a city gave itself to the Pope behold the Slovak Pope is coming a brother of the people you already pause the world bomb into our breasts and the angel choir sweet he's thrown for him with flowers can you believe that okay man of the earth and he appeared at Sinai and he\n\n(1:16:25) prayed at Sinai and he said the Ten Commandments are still binding Mary so-called revealed to father Dobby my Pope John Paul to I confirms to you is the Pope of my secret the Pope about whom I spoke to the children during the apparitions of fatty mine other words so in other words this was the Pope that\n\n(1:16:46) was to fulfill all the Fatima predictions and the last one that was not known was that this was the Pope that would be that would survive an attempted assassination and then when he has finished his work I will come from heaven and receive a sacrifice okay now what is the remedy she's married to the\n\n(1:17:07) problem that the world is facing all the scale she said this is a place where we see many of the root causes of our problem it is the commandment of keeping the Sabbath holy back to our question in the Old Testament not honoring this day was only one of several since punishable by death although we are not living\n\n(1:17:29) under law of the Old Testament there's a widespread abuse of all throughout the Christian culture concerning the Sabbath in the West we have lost God through our affluence in the East God has been lost through communism in suffering both have lost sight of the Sabbath which Sabbath's do you think that she's\n\n(1:17:45) talking about well it's Oscar God's intention for the others was a day of rest honoring God through worship conversation teaching and praise today if anyone even bothers to go to church at all sunday will be an endless litany of recreation television as Leduc event shopping blah blah blah goes on and on and on about what people\n\n(1:18:06) do on that particular day now mighty quarter and the commandment dear children today also I wish to tell you I'm with you in these Restless days in which Satan wishes to destroy everything the membrane on autism you twisted around which I and my son Jesus are building up in a special way he wishes to destroy your soul he wishes to guide\n\n(1:18:32) you as far away as possible from Christian life as well as from the commandments to which they the church is calling you so you may live them Satan wishes to destroy everything which is holy in you and around you there for little children pray pray pray in order to be able to comprehend all which God\n\n(1:18:53) is giving through my coming who's coming Mary's coming okay so now the famous day Adventist Church says keep the commandments of God and the Catholic Church through its visionaries is saying keep the commandments of Rome is this right or not okay and the pub says make it clear Sunday must not be work since\n\n(1:19:21) it must be celebrated as the Lord's Day can you see that the Sabbath has become the issue of acknowledging the authority of God yes that's not just a question of a day it's a question of authority so at the right time here comes a movement and says keep the commandments of God and they lift up the Sabbath the seventh-day\n\n(1:19:49) adventist church at the same time Mary appears and says Satan has been let loose on the planet and keep the Sabbath of the church the bus preaching the same thing just from two different perspectives and it's your choice whether you want to choose this perspective the only support you have for the doctrine signs and wonders\n\n(1:20:16) and apparitions and bleeding icons and suffering people that's the support or the other one thus says the Lord that's a choice that's the choice that the world has so no wonder at this interface meeting that we've spoken about so much it's the Christian fundamentalists that will be condemned and be declared\n\n(1:20:40) dangerous extremists full of hate here is Pope John Paul to ear leaves in the Marian cave praying at one of the apparition sites and this is fascinating this is the Pope's plain us TWA with his light shining above it which rose fest was the Shekinah glory ok on July 13 1986 our blessed mother explained\n\n(1:21:07) another of our roles through father guardian this is the moment for all to take refuge in me because I am the Ark of the New Covenant at the time of Noah immediately before the flood thousand the Lord at distance to survive his terrible chastisement entered into the ark in these your times I'm inviting all\n\n(1:21:27) my beloved children to enter into the ark of the new covenant which I have booked in my Immaculate Heart for you that they may be assisted by me to carry the bloody burden of the great trial which preceded the coming of the day of the Lord do not look anywhere else they're either happening today there is\n\n(1:21:44) happening today what happens in the days of the flight well the other side teaches the same thing it says there is an ARCA building God is calling of people into a relationship with himself you either come into the one Ark or keep the commandments of God and hope the testimony of Jesus or you climb into the\n\n(1:22:08) sock which one is of God John 14-6 jesus said unto them I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me and if it seems evil unto you to serve the Lord choose Jesus day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father serve that we're on the other side of the flag or the gods of the amorite in\n\n(1:22:30) whose hand lands you dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the law so that's our choice to ox which one are we going to choose choice is yours thank [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]",
  "# Title:234_history_s_coming_climax_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nSecond Coming of Christ,End-time Plagues,Secret Rapture Debate,Final Judgment,Millennium Events\n\n## Guide:\nThis lecture, titled \"History's Coming Climax,\" focuses on the end times and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, contrasting biblical prophecies with prevalent theological misconceptions. The speaker emphasizes that a clear understanding of scripture, particularly Revelation and Old Testament typologies, is crucial to avoid deception about false Christs and the nature of the Rapture. He meticulously details the universally visible and audible return of Christ with His angels, where He will not physically touch the Earth but will gather the righteous to meet Him in the air, a stark contrast to the popular \"secret rapture\" theory. The lecture also outlines a sequence of events at Christ's coming, including the resurrection of the righteous and the destruction of the wicked, who will face an executive judgment, rather than a second chance, culminating in the complete desolation of the Earth before a future restoration.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 234 - History's Coming Climax _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stl3bGTl3v8\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well this lecture is titled history's coming climax because that's exactly what it's all about after we've seen all the terrible things that are happening on this Earth and how two camps arise and now eventually the two camps will clash and the one is so obviously in the great\n\n(01:24) minority that it has absolutely no chance whatsoever and therefore the only thing that it has is Faith remember Revelation 18: 1 to4 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice Babylon the greatest Fallen\n\n(01:47) his Fallen become a habitation of devils and the H hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird and the story that all the nations have drunk of the wine of a fornication that the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her the merchants of the Earth have waxed Rich through the\n\n(02:06) abundance of her delic Delicacies and then I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues Revelation 18:1 to4 and then the end will come Isaiah 24:5 says the Earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed\n\n(02:35) the laws changed the ordinance broken the Everlasting Covenant let him who does wrong continue to do wrong let him who is vile continue to be vile let him who does right continue to do right and let him who is Holy continue to be holy behold I am coming soon my reward is with me and I will give to every\n\n(02:59) everyone according to what he has done let's have a look at the typology of Egypt which tells us something of what will happen towards the end and Pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens Exodus 5:5 this is an interesting verse Pharaoh is rebuking Moses for making the people\n\n(03:26) rest from their burdens and the word rest there is the word Shabbat what was God's answer when Pharaoh made a law prohibiting God's people from keeping the Sabbath what happened the plagues came and I saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign seven angels with the seven last plagues last because with\n\n(03:54) them God's wroth is completed Revelation 15:1 so obviously in the time after these laws have been made and after they have been decreed plagues will come in Egypt a law was made preventing the people from keeping Sabbath and when that law was made and implemented the plagues came there were 10 then because it was a\n\n(04:21) typology there are seven now this is the last event and this means that none of these plagues touch the people people of God and then will come the end of the world well doom and destruction and the question is is there no hope well yes otherwise we couldn't smile you see Titus 2:3 says looking for that blessed hope and the Glorious\n\n(04:54) appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ remember the Bible speaks about four comings of Christ the first one is as a babe the first coming he comes as a as a child and the Virgin will be with child all those texts in the Bible the second one is he comes to the Ancient of Days Daniel 7:13 and I saw one like a son of man\n\n(05:21) come with the Clouds Of Heaven to the Ancient of Days and Daniel watches this great scene in heaven while the little horn Catholicism is doing its thing down here on this Earth so Jesus is not coming to this Earth at this stage this is a change of activity in heaven Jesus is going to receive power and honor and\n\n(05:47) glory and probation is going to come to an end and all these things then there is the coming in glory the second coming and then there is a final coming to restore the Earth and to set up the king Kingdom there are four comings in the Bible and you really have to take them apart carefully the Jews totally\n\n(06:07) ignored that one because they were waiting for this one they even ignored that one and they ignored that one they were just waiting for the setting up of the Kingdom but you have to carefully pick them out and understand what is what in the Bible it's not that simple you can't just read it and say well\n\n(06:28) everything about rest of ation that's what's going to happen but that's what the world does today Isaiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel God With Us which one did that apply to obviously the first coming when he\n\n(06:51) came as a baby but that one was ignored behold the Virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is God With Us Matthew 1:23 so at the first coming Jesus Paid the price for sin he was wounded for our transgression he was bred bruised for\n\n(07:14) our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed Isaiah 53:5 did the Jews recognize that text yes or no no they looked over it why because they had an expectation that they wanted to fulfill but they didn't want to accept the biblical interpretation now why will he come\n\n(07:42) again John 14 in my father's house are many mansions we should be able to say this off by heart if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will will come again and receive you to myself so that where I am you may be also that's such a nice\n\n(08:07) picture of God I just love this picture of him that he's so caring and he wants us to be where he is so that's why he'll come again he's coming to do what so that we can be where he is also to receive you to myself so there's a receiving going on over there and we need to know how he will come again\n\n(08:34) because the Bible says beware many false christs are gone into the world doesn't it say so so how will he come again well these are the biblical criteria the second coming will be universally visible universally visible does the Church teach that no behold he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him Revelation\n\n(09:02) 1:7 every eye will see him that means there's nobody who won't know that he's come uh how does this text rhyme with a secret Rapture there's a problem there isn't there you can't have a secret Rapture and every eye will see him because there's nothing secret about that for as like lightning comes out of\n\n(09:30) the East and shines even to the West so also will be the coming of the son of man Matthew 24:27 anything secret about that I don't think so that's pretty visible he will be universally visible when he comes now the Bible says he comes with the clouds now what does that mean does it mean he's coming when it's a rainy day\n\n(09:59) who makes the clouds his Chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind psalms 104:3 now we have to do some Hebrew parallelism here so the clouds are his chariots the Chariots of God are 20,000 even thousands of thousands of Angels the Lord is among them as in sin in the Holy Place Psalm 68:17 so what\n\n(10:32) does Hebrew parallelism teach him Jesus is going to come with the angels so when he comes he's going to come in glory with all his angels and how many will see him every eye will see him as lightning from the East shines to the West so shall be the coming of the sun of man and they shall see the son of man\n\n(10:57) coming in the Clouds of heaven with power and great Glory Matthew 24:30 you see the picture so this means Jesus is coming with his angels that's what it means and when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels 2 Thessalonians 1:7 Matthew 25:31 and when the son of man shall come\n\n(11:25) in his glory and how many of the Angels all the angels with him then shall he sit on the throne of his glory so when Jesus comes all the angels are with him how many remain in heaven none they're all coming to this earth that is zillions upon zillions upon zillions of angels unbelievable sight wow it's going to be\n\n(11:57) something and when he comes in his own glory and the glory of the father and of the Holy Angels what does that tell you can you imagine the glory of the father Jesus is going to come with the glory of the father now if nobody can look upon God and live when he's sinful what do you think this is going to do to\n\n(12:23) people that have refused to give up sin it's going to be a problem problem and what about those who have been redeemed what is their only hope of surviving the event Jesus to be covered by his righteousness is the only hope that there is so he's going to come with the full glory of the godhead and all the\n\n(12:48) angels with him and the number of them was 10,000 times 10,000 and thousands of thousands Revelation 511 it's going to be a spectacular event when Jesus comes acts 1: 11 men of Galilee why do you stand gazing up into heaven this same Jesus who is taken up from you into heaven will come in the way you have\n\n(13:13) seen him going into heaven so how was he taken up also with angels they watched it they saw him go up and that same Jesus is going to come back not some ghost the one who said come put your hands here and put them in my side and see that I'm real this is a real Jesus who's coming back the second coming will also be\n\n(13:44) audible one Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with a voice of the Archangel and with the trumpet of God everybody will hear it Second Coming will be Audible shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they Shall Gather his elect from the Four Winds from one end of the\n\n(14:08) Heavens to the other Matthew 24:31 so who's going to gather God's people is there anything secret or quiet about this no so it's going to be a very spectacular event and all the elect will be gathered from all the corners now here's a very important criteria he will not touch the earth and the dead in Christ shall rise first so\n\n(14:34) there's a resurrection of the dead but it's the resurrection of those who are in Christ they rise then we which are still alive so the living that are in Christ at that time remain shall be caught up together with them the dead that were in Christ and the living that are in Christ will be caught up together with them in the\n\n(14:59) the clouds which means who the angels that have just gathered them all and what are the Angels going to do with them to meet the Lord in the air Ah that's a Rapture but it's not a secret Rapture it's a very loud Rapture and so we shall we ever be with the Lord 1 Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 we must read the verses carefully so when\n\n(15:30) Jesus comes every eye will see him he will not touch the ground he will send his angels to gather the elect the voice of God raises the righteous in Christ only them and they're all gathered and then the Angels take them up and they meet the Lord in the air he does not touch this Earth so when you hear that Jesus\n\n(15:57) is here or there or in the inner room what did Jesus say don't go don't bother it's not me Matthew 24:26 27 therefore if they shall say to you behold he's in the desert do not go out behold he's in the secret rooms do not believe it it's pretty simple not to believe it if you know the truth right for as the lightning comes out of\n\n(16:24) the East and shines even to the West so also will be the coming of the son of man Matthew 24: 2627 it's very plain the Bible makes no bones about it nobody should have to make a mistake on this now this is another tricky one what will take place at the second coming what does the world teach everybody will be converted\n\n(16:49) everything will be honky Dory the Bible hasn't said anything like that up to now the resurrection of the righteous that's one of the things that takes place when Jesus comes for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God and the dead in\n\n(17:09) Christ shall rise first the dead rise those in Christ Revelation 256 will tell us about the others the rest of the Dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished so when do the rest of the dead rise obviously a thousand years later is that what the text says yes or no okay so there are two resurrections the one\n\n(17:40) Resurrection is the resurrection of the just the other one will be a resurrection of the unrighteous but the between the two how long a thousand years is that what the world teaches out there no blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection that makes sense which Resurrection if you are dead\n\n(18:05) would you like to be in obviously the first one the second one could be kind of problematic so we want to be in the first resurrection Revelation 25 and6 who is in the first resurrection those who are in Christ simple as that so the righteous living what happens to them they're obviously not ra from the dead they are still waiting and\n\n(18:31) we could be part of that group you know that what happens to them well 1 Corinthians 15 5253 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump that's the same time when Jesus comes for the trumpet shall sound we've heard about that the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible\n\n(18:57) must put on incorrupt coruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so there's a change everything that is Mortal disappears if you have fillings in your teeth then watch out for anyone else because they'll just shoot up and you'll get a new set everything will be changed and nothing will die anymore that'll be\n\n(19:21) fantastic what happens else Philippians 320 and 21 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body in case you thought we were so cool that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body wow that is amazing God will give us a body like his\n\n(19:53) own amazing this is incredible stuff Matthew 13:49 and 50 so shall it be at the end of the world the Angels shall come forth sever the wicked from amongst the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth well the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich\n\n(20:17) men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men And every bondman and every freemen hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains so there are two categories on this earth when Jesus comes the one group is saying this is our God we have waited for him the Angels go collect them and what do they\n\n(20:37) do with them take them up and they meet the Lord in the air and the others what are they doing they're running for their lives and hiding wherever they can and who are they well it looks like the Great Men and the rich men and the chief captains and the Mighty Men and all these people that are now saying they're going to be the winners\n\n(21:00) it looks like they're going to be in trouble and said to the mountains and the Rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the wroth of the lamb for the great day of his wroth has come and who shall be able to stand Revelation 65 and 17 so they'd rather have a mountain fall\n\n(21:17) on them than face the Lord that's pretty serious you ever thought of that mountain rather than face the lord well what else happens to them and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth Rejoice because the Lord is going to restore this Earth and there will be a millennium of Peace\n\n(21:40) forever and ever no more troubles no it doesn't say that it doesn't say that at all Matthew 24:30 and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory they're going to be happy they going to be very happy behold the Lord came with 10, thousands\n\n(22:02) of his holy ones to do what execute judgment upon all and to convict all the ungodly of all their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought and of all the hard things which ungodly Sinners have spoken against him in this series we we've called it the total Onslaught against whom against Jesus\n\n(22:34) have we looked at some of the ungodly things they have said about him well there's a day of judgment coming for them and they might think they are the winners but this text says otherwise jws 14 and 15 says they're in trouble they're going to be convicted there's going to be a judgment there's nothing to be happy\n\n(22:53) about there's no conversion here there is a judgment an executive judgment the great day of the Lord is near is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the Lord the Mighty Men shall cry there bitterly that day is a day of Wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wastesson desolation a day of darkness\n\n(23:16) and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness saniah 11:4 and 15 who teaches this in the world have you ever heard this Doctrine preached in a church never nobody preaches it but that's what the Bible says all you have to do is read it 2 Thessalonians 2:8 and then the Lawless one the one who changes the law\n\n(23:39) of God will be revealed what happens to him what happens to the one who dared to change God's law and says I'm above the Bible I can do it who cares I can change the precepts of Christ what happens to him let's see whom the Lord shall consume with the breath of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his\n\n(24:01) coming 2 Thessalonians 2:8 this is tough tough medicine really tough so he might have a loud mouth now but he's not going to have a loud mouth for very long Jeremiah 25:33 and the slain of the Lord shall be at that day that's always pertaining to the second coming whether you read it in the Old Testament or the New Testament there's\n\n(24:29) Perfect Harmony from The slain at that day will be from one end of the Earth to the other end of the Earth they shall not be mourned nor gathered nor buried they shall be as dung on the ground Jeremiah 25:33 why will they not be gathered there's nobody to gather them why will they not be buried there's\n\n(24:55) nobody to bury them where are those that could perhaps bury them they're gone and not secretly either is it biblical so far I'm just reading the Bible I will utterly consume all things from off the land says the Lord I will consume man and Beast I will consume the fowls of the heaven and of the fishes of the Sea and\n\n(25:25) the stumbling blocks with the wicked and I will cut off man from off the land says the Lord did the animals sin why is the Lord going to destroy all the animals as well you see the animals through sin are suffering and the animals have become degraded and diseased if you look into your paleontology you will find that the\n\n(25:50) animals were huge in the past everything was much much bigger than today I bet you no dog ever got displacement I don't think animals suffered then as they suffer now in his mercy God is going to end this entire creation so what is going to be left on this Earth that's alive when Jesus comes nothing except something but I'll\n\n(26:20) come to that in a moment so everything is going to be destroyed does that sound like the story that is being preached in the world out there no right Psalms 110 the Lord is at your right hand and he will shatter Kings on the day of his wrath he will execute judgment among the Nations filling them with\n\n(26:42) corpses he will shatter Chiefs over the wide earth Psalms 1105 and 6 so what's going to happen to all these people that had such loud mouths against him they're going to die they're going to die Jeremiah 4:23 to8 I I beheld the Earth and indeed it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light I\n\n(27:03) beheld the mountains and indeed they trembled and all the hills moved back and forth I beheld indeed there was no man and all the birds of the heaven had fled is there Harmony between the prophets yes or no absolutely and I beheld and indeed the fruitful land was a Wilderness and how many of the Cities\n\n(27:23) all its cities were broken down at the presence of the Lord by his Fierce anger for thus says the Lord the whole land shall be desolate yet I will not make a full end for this shall the Earth mourn and the heavens above be black because I have spoken I have purposed and I will not relent nor will I turn back from it so although\n\n(27:45) everything is killed here it's not over yet there's still more to come lots of interesting things are going to happen and we have to unra rvel it so now the secret rapture Matthew 24 38-42 as for as in the days of the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving into marriage until the day that Noah entered\n\n(28:08) the Ark and did not know until the flood came and took them all away so also will the coming of the son of man be they will all be taken away as we saw then two men will be in the field one will be taken the other left two women will be grinding at the Mill one will be taken the other left watch therefore for you do not know what\n\n(28:30) hour your lord is coming this is the text that they use to substantiate the secret Rapture where does it say one will be taken secretly and the other one will be left does it say that no all it says one will be taken one will be left in other words the righteous one what will happen to him angels will gather him and take him\n\n(28:55) what to meet the Lord in the air the unrighteous one what happens to him he has to remain and be dead that's it there's no secret Rapture here is there any disharmony between this and what we've read no dispensationalists claim that Antichrist will arise after the secret Rapture but the Bible clearly teaches\n\n(29:18) that this power will arise from the church not after the church 1 John 2:18 and 19 little children it is the last hour and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come by which we know that it is the last hour they went out from us but they were not of us for they had\n\n(29:44) been of us they would have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that none of them were of us so if dispensationalism teaches that the Antichrist will come in the future and he will come not from the Christians but from another society that will persecute the Jews that is what they\n\n(30:05) claim that's not biblical it's not biblical and in any case the Antichrist doesn't come in the future he arose as we saw in Roman times already he comes out of the fourth Beast he comes out of Rome so dispensationalism cannot be right it cannot be because it's not biblical but you know that the virtually the entire\n\n(30:29) Pentecostal world and the Baptist World teaches this it's not biblical there is no Second Chance gospel the secret Rapture teaches a second chance gospel it teaches that those who are sinful will get another chance and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment there's no Second Chance Hebrews 9:27\n\n(30:55) you decide now or never let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our garden he will abundantly pardon Isaiah 55:7 there is no multiple choice here the just and the wicked revealed at the same time God is just he will pay\n\n(31:16) back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled and to us as well this will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels is there any second chance here yes or no no so the secret Rapture is it biblical yes or no decide from the text there is very\n\n(31:41) simple the Bible cannot lie to itself let both grow together until the Harvest and at the time of the Harvest I will say to the rapest first gather together the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn Matthew 13 and 30 verse 30 is that secret is that a secret Rapture with a second chance yes or no\n\n(32:07) no everything happens when the Lord comes so virtually the entire Protestant world is teaching a Jesuit Doctrine alaza and Ribera futurism preterism both started by Jesuits both being taught in the Protestant world it's not biblical it's a lie blatantly to dup people into not obeying the precepts of word of God\n\n(32:35) the secret Rapture God's people those who have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb have to go through the tribulation they are not raptured before it question were the Israelites raptured away when the plagues fell yes or no no they were there and they saw a difference between them and the other\n\n(32:58) and then they were taken away and what happened to pharaoh and his army he was destroyed that's a typology it's a little enactment of a greater reality at the end of time then one of the elders answered saying to me who are these arrayed in white robes and where did they come from and I said to them sir\n\n(33:20) you know so he said to me these are the ones who came out of the Great Tribulation and washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb they have to go through the tribulation they're not spared the tribulation the secret Rapture or the Rapture Theory teaches that Christians will be spared\n\n(33:40) the tribulation will be taken away it's not biblical you have to be here in that day they will say surely This Is Our God we trusted in him he saved us this is the Lord we trusted in him let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation two groups the one wailing the other one rejoicing Isaiah 25:9 so there is no secret Rapture there\n\n(34:05) is a glorious coming of the lord and there is a destruction of the living Wicked the Living Dead uh stay dead that's not actually a bad way to say it right uh the dead that died in sin stay dead for how long thousand years what are the signs of his coming well you can read them in Matthew 24 Mark 13 Luke 21\n\n(34:31) there will be war and distress of Nations there will be earthquakes as in the days of Noah the gospel will be preached worldwide there will be tribulation there will be false christs and there will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars those were some of them we've dealt with many of them in\n\n(34:47) these lectures and uh these are the issues Matthew 24 2 and 3 and Jesus said to them do you not see all these things truly are say to you that there shall not be left here one stone on another that shall not be thrown down that was a typology of what's going to happen to this earth God is going to destroy it\n\n(35:10) utterly and as he sat on the Mount of Olives his disciples came to him privately tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the signs of your coming and of the end of the world Matthew 24 so there was the temple that's a replica of the Temple when uh it was destroyed by Titus they started by burning it they\n\n(35:36) were supposed to be preserved but they shot burning arrows into it it burnt like pitch the gold melted and ran down and ran between the stones and after the fires were over the soldiers turned over every single Stone to gather the molten Metals here is the manora an emblem of it on the Titus Arch where the slaves\n\n(36:00) are carrying it back to Rome the great day of the Lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the Lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly it's a day of wroth trouble distress Wast desolation Darkness gloominess clouds thick Darkness it's not going to be a good day and there shall be signs in the Sun and\n\n(36:23) the Moon and in the stars and upon the Earth distress of nations with perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring men's Hearts failing them for fear not a joyful time Mark Luke 21:25 and 26 Matthew 24:7 Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom this is an interesting text isn't that a\n\n(36:46) duplication no it's not and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places Nation against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom the word Nation there in the original is the word ethnos can you see it ethnic group against ethnic group and then Kingdom against Kingdom that's a defined border yes there will\n\n(37:16) be Wars amongst Nations but within Nations you will have atnos against atnos yeah the tosis and the hutus and the terrible confrontations and the hatred that is being built up between races and between cultures and all these things this will boil over in the last days James 5:3 your golden silver have\n\n(37:44) corroded and their poison will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh as fire you Heap Treasures up in the last days so they will be economic woes behold the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crith and the cries of them which have reaped are\n\n(38:02) entered into the ears of the Lord economic woes labor unrest jobs in an age of insecurity false christs false prophets Great Signs wonders we've had whole lectures on it mraa appearing Maran Visions you name it all the great religions posit the idea of further Revelation to be given by a future teacher hello the Bible doesn't posit\n\n(38:29) that idea just all these great religions but they're all teaching something contrary to the Bible Christians hope for the return of the Christ the Buddhists look for the coming of another Buddha the Lord mraa Muslims await the Iman madii the Hindus The Reincarnation of Krishna and the Jews the Messiah they're all going to be in\n\n(38:50) for a big surprise because none of that is going to materialize except in deception but when the Lord comes they will know it second Timothy 3 and know also that in the last days perilous times shall come men shall be lovers of their own selves Covetous boasters proud Blasphemous disobedient to parents than\n\n(39:15) unthankful Unholy we see all these things today without natural affection truce Breakers accusers continent that list is just endless heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure for form of godliness denying the power thereof Universal peace no Universal pistols and then many will be offended and will betray one another and will\n\n(39:41) hate one another this was this massacre in Japan when they killed all those with gas the Earth shall be old like an garment there will be economic woes there will be ecological woes for INF flute Ians more storms great catastrophes and in the middle of the irony Jesus loves you how the beasts Gran the herds of\n\n(40:08) cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture flock of sheep are made desolate the Lord to see will I cry for the fire has devoured the postures of the Wilderness great fires the land less milk honey this was Australia with the last Al Nino that's what it looked like and the fires in California and bad\n\n(40:30) blood and AIDS let no one deceive himself we are drifting towards a catastrophe Walter Litman few additional signs increase in knowledge increased demonic activity departure from the faith economic woes rise and false teachers increase in traffic and speed I quite like that one and Disobedience and Anarchy but thou Daniel shut up the\n\n(40:55) words and seal up the book even to the time of of the end then knowledge shall be increased the word of God will be made plain there will be literal knowledge as well which will increase and that will help to spread the gospel and there will be many unclean spirits and frogs and all these beasts and false\n\n(41:14) prophets and all these strange things when the Lord comes they are spirits of devils working miracles I like this one n 2:4 The Chariot shall rage in the streets they shall jle one against the other in the Broadways they shall seem like torches they shall run like the lightning did he see this I don't think so I think think he\n\n(41:37) saw something like this fast traffic be patient until the coming of the Lord you also be patient establish your hearts for the coming of the Lord draws near James 57 and when these things come to pass then look up and lift your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh Luke 21:28 and then we could say I have fought a good fight I have\n\n(42:04) finished my course I have kept my faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give to me when at that day so did Paul expect to receive his crown upon his death no no he was expected to receive it at that day and not to me only but unto all them\n\n(42:31) that love is appearing behold I come as a thief blessed is he that watches and keepeth His Garment lest he walk naked and they shall see his shame Revelation 16:15 so some people won't even know that he's coming for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night so this is often used you know for\n\n(42:53) the secret story for when they shall say peace and safety then suddenly destruction comes upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not Escape but notice this verse but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief so if you know your Bible should you be caught\n\n(43:14) unawares yes or no no shouldn't be a surprise but those that are expecting wonderful things and a millennium of peace and all of these things will they be surprised oh yeah they're going to be surprised very surprised for the father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the son John 5:22 papacy says the Judgment seat\n\n(43:37) belongs to it no no no papacy you're wrong all judgment belongs to the Sun but the Judgment shall sit and they shall take away his Dominion papal Dominion to consume and to destroy it to the end Daniel 7:26 this is a reference to the little horn power the papacy whose ion will be taken away Daniel 7 13\n\n(44:01) and 14 and I saw in the night vision and behold one like the son of man come with the clouds of heaven and he came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him this is not the coming of the Lord this is something totally different and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that\n\n(44:20) all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed so the coronation takes place in heaven jesus takes off his Priestly robe and he puts on his kingly robe probation ends and then plagues come upon this\n\n(44:46) Earth and after that the Lord comes again and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to his work shall be revelation 22 12 the Bible says there will be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time Daniel 121 so in this time after this close of\n\n(45:09) probation there will be a terrible time of trouble plagues will fall we'll go into the details of that uh later A thousand shall fall at thy side 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee internal realiz these promises Only With Thine Eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the Wicked This is\n\n(45:34) the biblical story because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation then they gathered the Kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called armagedon Revelation 1616 the Greek word for place is topos and topos has a literal meaning as well as a metaphorical meaning so the latter\n\n(46:03) means a state of mind so you can have a state of mind that will lead to something so Satan will induce a state of mind in the people of the world that will compel them to seek the death of those who refuse to obey their dictates does that Mak sense Joel calls it the valley of Jehoshaphat okay Zachariah states that the Nations\n\n(46:30) will be gathered to Jerusalem meaning that they will fight against God's people now either the one or the other I will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of yapat Joel 3:2 I will gather all nations to Jerusalem to fight against them Zechariah 14:2 is the Bible contradicting itself I don't think so you see what the\n\n(46:55) Bible is doing here it's describing a typology at the valley of Jehoshaphat that is where God intervened and fought on behalf of the children of God Jerusalem is a type of God's people God will intervene and fight on behalf of God's people who destroys the wicked one with the brightness of his coming Jesus\n\n(47:22) is it the Russians no it says the Lord will destroy him with the brightness of his coming and not some Antichrist power that will be overcome somewhere in the Middle East and the sixth Angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of\n\n(47:42) the East might be prepared Revelation 16:12 oh that's the Russians oh no that's the Turks or whatever they wanted it to do but it's not in harmony with the rest of the Bible now here is the actual Valley and up there Ahab had his uh Fortress and when you are in the valley of megiddo there is one Mount that seems prominent and that's\n\n(48:12) Carmel and at Carmel there was a decision where Elijah said choose thee this day whom you will serve it's the valley of decision that's where it is decide for the one or the other let us come near together for judgment who raised up the righteous one from the East called him to his foot gave the Nations before him and made him rule\n\n(48:39) over Kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as a driven stubble to his bow Isaiah 411 and2 what is Isaiah implying here who is this king of the East it's the Messiah it's Jesus yes it's the Messiah are we absolutely sure let's have a look here's Ezekiel 431 and2 afterwards he brought me to the\n\n(49:02) gate even the gate that lookth towards the east and behold the glory of the god of Israel came from the way of the East who's he coming with he's coming with all his angels and he's coming with the glory of the father as well and His glory and his voice was like the noise of many Waters and the Earth shined with his glory so who are\n\n(49:30) these Kings from the East that are coming Jesus and his angels Jesus and his angels that's the only Harmony that you can find behold the Lord came with 10,000s of his holy ones to execute judgment upon all there's not going to be no literal armagedon with all the nations of the world gathered in a tiny little Valley\n\n(49:55) that wouldn't fit in there in the first place and to convict all the ungodly of their works of ungodliness which they have ungodly wrought and of all the hard things which ungodly Sinners have spoken against them that's what's going to happen and he had been clothed in a garment dipped in Blood and his name is\n\n(50:14) called the word of God and the armies of Heaven are we getting the picture what war is this going to be it's going to be a Heavenly War heaven intervention the armies of Heaven followed him on white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean and out of his mouth goes a sharp sword so that with it he should strike the Nations and\n\n(50:41) he will shepher them with a rod of iron and he Treads The Wine Press of the wine of the anger and of the wroth of almighty God and voices and Thunders and lightning occurred and there was a great earthquake such as has not been since men were on the earth so mighty and so great an earthquake Revelation 16:18 so\n\n(51:01) the carpet's going to be pulled out from under every city and the cities of the Nations fell and every island fled away that's an interesting one and the mountains were not found and then a great hail that's the seventh plague as the size of a talent that's about J big blocks of ice came down out of Heaven on men and\n\n(51:31) men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail for the plague of it was exceeding great have you entered into the storehouses of snow or have you seen the storehouses of the hail which I have kept for the time of trouble against the day of battle and War job 38:22 223 Armageddon is a war fought by God using\n\n(51:56) Earth quake and hail to destroy those who destroy want to destroy God's people Revelation 6:17 and the great day of his wroth has come and who shall be able to stand the Beast Catholicism was taken and with him the false prophet I was taken the two were thrown alive into the lake of burning fire with brimstone\n\n(52:27) and the rest who's that Kings of the Earth the merchants all the others were slain By The Sword of him who sat on the horse it proceeding out of his mouth okay who's missing in the Triad up there the dragon's not there the dragon is the Demonic forces that have gathered the people into all this spiritualistic\n\n(52:54) Union he's not there the Beast Catholicism and Fallen apostate protestantism that went into alliance and all the Babylonian forces are destroyed but the Demonic forces they remain even so the Lord God Almighty true and righteous are your judgments Revelation 16:7 the rest of the Dead remember did not live again until the thousand years\n\n(53:22) were finished this is the first resurrection Revelation 25 by the way this looks kind of strange this is the first resurrection you must remember that Revelation is written as a kaym and we're actually reading backwards so the ideas are back to front the rest of the Dead are not alive but blessed and holy are those that had\n\n(53:47) passed in part in the first resurrection the description is reversed so the living Wicked die the dead Wicked remain dead a thousand years and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so we shall be with the Lord forever one\n\n(54:12) Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 so the righteous go up to heaven the dead righteous the living righteous translated at the same time up they go the rest are slain so the righteous dead raised together with the righteous living they are translated and meet the Lord in the air is that biblical it shall be said in that day Lo This Is Our\n\n(54:34) God we have waited for him and he will save us this is the Lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation Isaiah 25:9 either you belong in the group that rejoices or you belong in the group that weeps and whales 2 Timothy 1:12 for I know whom I have believed and I am persuaded that he\n\n(54:57) is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against what that day what day are they always talking about the coming of Christ there is no such thing as when you die you go to heaven or when you die you go to hell when you die you're in your grave when you are resurrected you either are in the\n\n(55:23) resurrection of life or you are in the resurrection of of death one of the two now we're going to continue this story and we'll see the greater picture of what's going to happen in the Millennium what is the story about hell we're going to deal with that in great detail does it exist does it not exist and then\n\n(55:43) we're going to see what's going to happen in the final reconstruction of the kingdom of [Music]

  "# Title:235_the_long_awaited_millennium_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nThe Millennium,End-time Prophecies,God's Judgment,Satan's Destruction,New Earth\n\n## Guide:\nThis source delves into various interpretations of the \"Millennium\" as described in biblical prophecy, with particular emphasis on Walter Veith's refutation of amillennialism, postmillennialism, and different forms of premillennialism. Veith argues that none of these common doctrines align with a consistent biblical understanding. Instead, he presents an alternative timeline where Christ's second coming slays the wicked and takes the righteous to heaven for a thousand years of \"judgment of verification\", while the earth becomes a desolate, chaotic abyss where Satan is bound by circumstance. After this millennium, the wicked are resurrected and, deceived by Satan, attempt to besiege the New Jerusalem (a literal city descending from heaven) but are consumed by fire, leading to their ultimate annihilation, not eternal torment. Finally, the Earth is recreated into a new, perfect dwelling where God's people reside, free from sin, death, and suffering, emphasizing a literal and joyous eternal kingdom here on a transformed Earth.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 235 - The Long Awaited Millennium _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duXsGn8MTUg\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well now we're going to talk this evening about the long awaited Millennium and this is a very complex issue in the previous lecture where we dealt with the coming of Christ we saw that when Christ comes again he does not touch the ground and he stays in the air and the elect are gathered and meeting\n\n(01:29) him in the air there are of course other verses in the Bible where Christ comes down and touches the Mount of Olives for example and we'll have to deal with that as well now this long awaited Millennium is a very important issue in the time that we are living and there are various doctrines the one is a\n\n(01:54) millennialism and that teaches there is no specific period of a thousand year reign the period applies to the whole of church history and this is the view that is held by Roman Catholicism and some conservative Protestant groups they hold to a millennialism there is no Thousand-Year period and the church\n\n(02:16) Reigns then there is postmillennialism this view claims that the kingdom is a present reality because Christ Reigns in his church All Nations will be converted to Christ prior to the coming of Christ the period prior to his coming will become peaceful and the gospel will be spread to All Nations both the Lutheran alburg\n\n(02:41) confession and the Puritan Westminster Confession subscribe to this view well the Bible doesn't teach that at all the Bible doesn't teach that everybody is going to become peaceful and the gospel will spread to All Nations the Bible says when they say peace peace what comes then sudden destruction so neither a millennialism\n\n(03:04) nor postmillennialism is the biblical view then we have premillennialism and you have dispensational premillennialism which teaches a secret Rapture prior to the tribulation and that we have seen is not biblical either the Millennium Kingdom reaches its fulfillment in the Jewish Nation that's what they\n\n(03:27) teach but the Jewish Nation according to the Bible that the time of the Jews will come to an end after the 70 weeks and then the gospel would go to the Gentiles a Jew can become part of the Kingdom today by accepting Jesus Christ as his personal savior the Jewish Nation the temple the sacrificial system are restored in\n\n(03:54) Palestine they teach well if you restore the sacrificial system what do you saying you're saying that Jesus died for not because the sacrificial system was a symbol a type of the death of Christ you're going to crucify him all over again in a new sacrificial system that was done away with when Christ died\n\n(04:18) that's why the curtain tore from top to bottom isn't that right showing that God ended the sacrificial system all warnings given to the church regarding the time of trouble prior to the coming of Christ now become applicable to the Jews only as do Matthew 24 and Ma and Luke 21 and all the teachings regarding the kingdom that\n\n(04:41) makes no sense whatsoever I thought the kingdom is the Blessed hope of those who are waiting for the return of the Lord then you have historic premillennialism the redeemed of all ages on the earth during the Millennium the church is the Israel of God comprising all the peoples of God God the millennial period constitutes\n\n(05:01) the first thousand years of God's Kingdom on Earth is that biblical no because the Bible says clearly when the Lord comes what happens to people they die and how many did Jeremiah see there were no man nothing so those are the main teachings in the world and none of them are biblical none of them not one the end of the world so\n\n(05:27) what will it be like getting ready for the Millennium there was so much hype at the turn of the century Isaiah 1413 and 14 for thou Hast said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God and I will be like the most high Satan wanted to be like God Isaiah Chapter\n\n(05:53) 14 verse 12 and thou how art thou fallen from Heaven no Day St star son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground that it's lay low the Nations and thou set in thy heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of congregation in the uttermost parts\n\n(06:16) of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will make myself like the most high there are the six eyes of selfishness and he wants to sit in the north that's where the Throne of God is and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light 2 Corinthians 11:14 1 Peter 58 be sober be vigilant\n\n(06:47) because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour therefore Rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitant of the earth and the Sea the the Nations for the Devil is come down unto you having great wroth because he knows that he has but a short time so\n\n(07:06) where's the devil here and his Nations down here he's in control down here God is in Ultimate control but permits him his Venture with sin and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great Authority Revelation 13:2 so the dragon is using a system we've identified it Roman Catholicism to work through the pope has power to\n\n(07:34) change laws to abgate laws to dispense with all things precepts of Christ he is the one who changes God's law has his own Mark of authority which is this his Sabbath and church and state work together to enforce papal systems and they are actually Dragon systems so Jesus Christ is replaced by a system system on this earth and the\n\n(08:02) Bible says that protestantism will create an image unto the Beast and will also eventually have church and state do exactly the same thing through a holy Alliance and causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand and in their forets that no man might bu\n\n(08:22) ourselves save he that had the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name Revelation 13 16-1 17 we've dealt with this issue how it's going to go about Ezekiel 202 and2 hallow my sabbaths and there shall be assigned between me me and you and know that I am the Lord your God hearken unto me that\n\n(08:45) you know righteousness the people in whose Hearts is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be afraid of their revilings nothing's changed what happened then happens at the end whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he's guilty of all either we're fully with God or we're\n\n(09:07) not with him that's the point for he who said do not commit adultery also said do not murder now if thou commit no adultery yet thou kill th become a transgressor of the law so speak and so you do as you shall be judged by the law of Liberty so let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God keep his\n\n(09:26) Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or evil Ecclesiastes 1213 and 14 just a little summary to bring us back up to speed acts tells us he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man\n\n(09:46) whom he has ordained that's Jesus and he has given Assurance of this to All by raising him from the dead no question about who that is Ecclesiastes says in 3:17 I said said in my heart God shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a Time therefore every purpose and for every work there will be a\n\n(10:09) judgment the righteous and the wicked now where does judgment begin judgment begins with the people of God for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God 1 Peter 4:17 if you've had much light you'll\n\n(10:37) have to give an account you'll have to give an account when we are judged God reveals our character to us and chastens us that we might be refined you know people have this notion oh my judgment is up boom does he qualify does he not qualify no he was bad Bo gone no God doesn't work like that when you become a\n\n(11:03) Christian when you come to Christ you come under judgment so this judgment can be a good thing for the Christian but when we are judged we are chastened by the Lord if you are in Christ he starts chastening you that we might not be condemned with the world isn't that a good thing so you be become a Christian you accept Jesus Christ but\n\n(11:32) you must be willing to what change and what if you are not willing to change without sanctification you will not see God you might say I want to become a Christian I accept Jesus Christ now I've become a Christian hello now the Lord says change and you say no I'm saved now I don't have to change will you make it or not no when\n\n(12:02) you come into this judgment God shows you your character and you have to change and as I've explained before he uses those we love and he uses those in the church to help us change the Three Angels messages goes out into the world the first Angel's message you remember that the Everlasting gospel the hour of the\n\n(12:27) Judgment has come the second Angel's mess Babylon has fallen the third angel mark of the beast that's the warning last warning on Earth and after these things what comes then Revelation 18 1-4 we've seen it Babylon is Fallen she's become a unclean Haven for demons the church is no longer preaching what it\n\n(12:52) should and uh all that become involved with her the Kings and the merchants they will have to face the consequences Revelation 1613 and 14 the unclean spirits like frogs go out into the world and they gather everyone for this Mighty battle these spirits of Devil's working miracles which go to the kings of the\n\n(13:18) earth and the whole world to gather them for this great Battle of God Almighty and we've seen that we need patience and cling to obedience to God and Faith of Jesus then the decree goes out he that is unjust remain unjust he that is filthy remain un remain filthy probation comes to a close there will be a time of trouble\n\n(13:45) such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time Daniel 121 so that's the sequence you see how it's going to happen the last message goes out do not accept the mark of the beast which will be enforced people will be forced to keep the papal Sabbath and Papal laws and if they don't go along\n\n(14:07) with that if they keep to the biblical ones just like Pharaoh there will be a decree you may not rest no Shabbat God's answer plagues a time of trouble such as not was since there was a nation and then I saw another sign in heaven great and marvelous seven angels having the seven last plagues so now\n\n(14:31) comes retribution for in them is filled up the wrath of God Revelation 151 now the first plague hits the Earth the second one hits the sea the third one The Fountains and the rivers and the fourth one the Sun and the Earth is scorched the Sea and the fountains turn to blood and we've had parallels when we had the trumpets\n\n(15:02) remember that but they were a third this is now a final retributive series of plagues that strike the Earth that will keep these antagonists of God very busy and in great trouble the fifth plague hits the Throne of the Beast that is Catholicism itself will come under the condemnation of whole plague the sixth plague the\n\n(15:32) Euphrates the Euphrates is the river that fed Babylon they have Waters of peoples and Nations and multitudes the multitudes that fed Babylon will dry up Babylon will stand exposed and then comes an earthquake and hail it's poured out into the air and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great\n\n(16:00) voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done Revelation 16:17 so after the plagues then comes this final destruction and the last plague but during those plagues there shall no evil Beall thee neither any plague come near thy dwelling Psalms 91:10 and Isaiah says in chapter 26 20\n\n(16:25) and 21 come my people enter thou into thy Chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyselves as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpassed so God will make it possible for God's people to escape these terrible things for behold the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the Earth for\n\n(16:51) their iniquity and the all Earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain there will be a resurrection so prior to the coming of the Lord God's people are protected from the plagues and they are hidden now Brethren concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering\n\n(17:15) together to him we ask you not to be soon shaken in mind or trouble either by Spirit or by word or by letter as if from us as though the day of Christ had come let no one deceive you by any means means for that day will not come unless the falling away comes first so there's a falling away and the man of sin is\n\n(17:37) revealed the son of pedition well we did that we showed how he changed the laws and all those things who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he sits as God in the temple of God showing himself that he is God we've seen all these things taking place two\n\n(17:56) Thessalonians and now you know what is restraining we dealt with that that he may be revealed in his own time for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work in Paul's time already so is the Antichrist going to come in the future or was he busy already in the past he was busy already in the past and\n\n(18:17) he who now restrains and we showed that that was the Roman Empire will do so until he is taken out of the way and then the Lawless one will be revealed what's going to happen to him whom the Lord will consume with the breath of his mouth and Destroy with the brightness of his coming so this Antichrist obviously\n\n(18:37) arose then ruled and will eventually be destroyed when when Christ comes the coming of the Lawless one is according to the work of Satan with all power signs lying wonders and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish because they did not receive the love of truth that they might be saved\n\n(18:58) did God give them an opportunity to find out the truth yes or no over and over and over the Reformation the last message remember we went through these texts he were now hinders hinders until he taken away what obstacle was there but the Roman State that's what we discussed in detail in that lecture so Rome hindered then the\n\n(19:20) Antichrist comes what does that do to the doctrine of futurism destroys it what does that do to the doctrine of preterism that the Antichrist came out of Greece destroys it why because Paul clearly says that this is still going to happen if Paul had known that Antiochus epas was the Antichrist then he would\n\n(19:48) have said don't worry about it he's gone says this he's going to come still so preterism is not an option it's a lie futurism is also not an option because the Antichrist arises then already and grows and will be destroyed eventually when Christ comes is that clear to everyone here John chrom said the same\n\n(20:09) remember when the Roman Empire is taken out of the way then Antichrist shall come and so irus Jerome while the Caesars held Imperial power it was impossible for the predicted Antichrist to come on the fall of the Caesars he would arise and so we see that what the world teaches is not biblical say to them that are of fearful\n\n(20:32) heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you Isaiah 35:4 now think about this if Jerusalem is to be built rebuilt here on Earth and the Jews are supposed to replenish everything then why doesn't it say your God will come with Rec compense and\n\n(20:59) reinstate you as the ruling Nation no no no he's going to come and save those that are his and the rest are all going to be destroyed for the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not I will help thee Isaiah 4113 so the coming of the Lord is to reap the Harvest of the souls so Revelation central theme behold he\n\n(21:23) cometh with the clouds and every eye shall see him is what the first coming is all about and we saw that it will be a visible one as Lightning comes from the East and flashes to the West so will be the coming of the son of man he shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and he shall reward every man\n\n(21:42) according to his work and Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation John 5289 two resurrections separated by a\n\n(22:04) thousand years we're just doing a quick summary here so there's a resurrection of life and there's a resurrection of damnation that's Biblical teaching now the resurrection of life let's just go through it again for the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the Archangel and with a trumpet call of\n\n(22:25) God and the dead in Christ will rise first so that's the first resurrection 1 Thessalonians 4:16 looking for that blessed hope in the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ Titus 2:13 he saves us the eyes of the blind will be open the ears of the death shall be unstopped there's a total change then\n\n(22:49) shall the lame man leap as a heart the tongue of the Dum sing Isaiah 355 and6 the Lord himself shall descend from the heaven with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel Trump of God dead in Christ right first and we shall be changed for the corruptible must put on incorruption and the Mortal must put on immortality\n\n(23:09) that's what happens at the coming of Christ then we which are alive remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air that we dealt with that in that whole lecture all the details 1 Thessalonians 4:17 we didn't answer all the questions we're going to answer them now what else has to transpire so at the\n\n(23:35) first coming or the well the second coming of Christ at his coming in glory the righteous go to heaven that's what the Bible says remember what happens to the wicked great day of Wrath is come who will be able to stand Revelations 16:7 they hid themselves in the dens the mountains the rocks and they said fall\n\n(23:57) on us the wroth of the Lamb has come and the Lord will execute Kings in that day and he'll fill the places with dead bodies that's what the Bible says Psalms 1105 and 6 now here's the answer of the Lord to the I of Satan and it shall come to pass in that day says the Lord that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst\n\n(24:22) of Thee I will destroy thy chariots thy military if you like I will cut off the cities of the land and throw down all thy strongholds I will cut off witchcraft out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers thy graven images also I will cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no\n\n(24:44) more worship The Works of thy hands and I will pluck up thy Groves out of the midst of thee so I will destroy thy cities I will execute Vengeance in anger and fury upon the Heathen such as they have not heard m 5 10- 15 how many eyes there eight the number of Christ wow beautiful little parallels in the Bible so Christ\n\n(25:11) is coming to put an end to Satan's kingdom on this Earth is that biblical yes or no okay so the wicked living are slain at the coming of Christ and what happens to this planet and what happens to Satan that's a good question and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his\n\n(25:41) hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years Revelation 20 one and two so Satan is now going to be bound for how long thousand years how is he bound literal chains no he's Bound by chains of circumstances for a thousand years Psalms\n\n(26:11) 686 God Seth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land you see there are change of chains of circumstance why is Satan Bound for A Thousand Years by the circumstances he's in there's nobody around in order for him to deceive them there's nothing for\n\n(26:39) him to do but he's limited to this planet he's going to stay here A Thousand Years with nothing on the planet he can rest from his labors for a thousand years interesting that's the Millennium mil anos 1,00 th000 years remember Jeremiah 426 I beheld and lo the fruitful place was a Wilderness and all the cities\n\n(27:06) thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord and by his Fierce anger so how many cities left on this planet none desolate cities destroyed and the slain of the Lord shall be at that day when the Bible says that day it means the coming of the Lord from one end of the the Earth even unto the other end of the Earth they shall\n\n(27:30) not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground we read this text they're all dead so at the second coming of Christ Jesus returns the righteous living ascended the righteous dead are resurrected the wicked living are slain how do they go to the Lord with the clouds with the angels\n\n(27:57) where do they meet him in the air that's biblical the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished Revelation 20: 5 so between the first resurrection and the second re Resurrection 1,000 years nothing happening on this planet so our day Jesus returns Earth desolate Satan is bound\n\n(28:29) abusos without form and void Genesis 1:2 the Earth returns to abusos State formless void destroyed and there it lingers with only demons to occupy it the Earth in a torn up darkened condition is the bottomless pit where Satan will be forced to stay during a thousand years and he can look at all those dead bodies and he has no power\n\n(28:58) because he is not capable of resurrecting them so what about the righteous during the Millennium what happens now in the Millennium well let's read about it Revelation 20:6 they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years where will that be must be in heaven right must be in\n\n(29:30) heaven and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them Revelation 20:4 okay I have a question if Jesus is coming with the clouds of heaven and he severs the righteous from the unrighteous if all judgment has been given unto Jesus then that judgment has already taken place right so what judgment is is now given\n\n(29:57) to the Saints here they are they all have Thrones and judgment is given to them and they can look into the books do you not know that the Saints will judge the world do you not know that we will judge Angels wow that means which Angels the Fallen Angels 1 Corinthians 6 2 and 3 so Satan will be judged the\n\n(30:26) Judgment reveals that God has done everything he can to save every individual even so Lord God Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments Revelation 16:7 I call this the Judgment of verification God has judged the world Jesus returns he sever the wck wicked from the just the righteous go with him\n\n(30:50) to Heaven he has prepar a place for them I go and I will come to take you where I am also he takes to heaven and now they have an opportunity to see whether God was just and they can go through the books and check out every single individual that has ever lived and the whole catastrophe of Sin from its Inception to its\n\n(31:14) end and if you have a question where is so and so that was such a good person or why is this one here what's he doing there wow then you have an opportunity to look in the books and what will the books reveal that God was just and fair in all his dealings and we can look through the entire process of sin every individual\n\n(31:48) wow imagine 6,000 years of History it's going to be quite something that's going to be a long process and while we are there we can grow in knowledge and wisdom and be totally transformed over a thousand year period into that which God had intended for us to be we will be instantly changed when we come but\n\n(32:11) imagine what we will learn in heaven how many questions will we have unbelievable number of questions and God will answer them personally and we can check it out and we will say even so Lord God Almighty TR and righteous are thy judgments so during the Millennium the righteous are in heaven the Earth is desolate Satan is\n\n(32:35) bound and the Judgment of verification takes place in heaven the Judgment that Jesus has executed is given to the Saints to verify check it out see if my judgment was fair that's pretty neat I like that now remember that the Bible speaks of forc comings of of Christ as a babe we've dealt with that to the Ancient of Days there was in a\n\n(33:05) was a Heavenly coming in glory the second coming where there's a resurrection of the righteous and then to restore the Earth and set up the kingdom there's no kingdom here yet they are up there in heaven and they are ruling the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished Revelation 25 who is the only\n\n(33:25) one who is the resurrection and the life Christ so who has to resurrect them Christ has to resurrect them obviously that means that he has to come back to this earth to resurrect them right or wrong okay let's have a look at this when the thousand years are expired Satan shall be loosed out of his prison\n\n(33:49) and shall go out to deceive the Nations Revelation 27 and8 where do these nations now come from what happens after the Thousand Years it said the rest of the Dead did not live until the thousand years were over that means after the thousand years there must be a what a resurrection and all of a sudden here are these billions of\n\n(34:14) people from all kinds of Nations and Satan looks at them and says wow I've got my team back does that make sense does it make sense all right so how goes and he deceives them again how does he deceive them he probably tells them I resurrected you I resurrected you so there's a resurrection of damnation Zechariah 143 and4 then shall\n\n(34:41) the Lord go forth and fight against those Nations as when he fought in the day of battle now there's another War coming Another War and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof towards the\n\n(35:06) east and towards the west and there shall be a very great valley and a half of the mountain shall remove towards the North and a half of it towards the South Zechariah 143 and 4 which Jerusalem is this is it the old Jerusalem down here weren weren't all the cities destroyed so where does this Jerusalem\n\n(35:27) come from and the Lord now is not staying in the air so that the others meet him what is he doing he comes down and as he the sinless one touches this defiled Earth what happens a mighty plane is opened up and cleansed for what for something to come down and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem coming down from God out\n\n(36:04) of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband Revelation 212 all right are we talking about this old Jerusalem here or this New Jerusalem now where does this one come from this is the greatest spaceship that will ever come to earth a whole city you huge nobody can even imagine it wow a huge City and God comes and he comes\n\n(36:36) down onto the Earth and and then City comes down who's in the city God's people God's people where were they for the last thousand years in heaven so now you have two groups in on Earth the new Jerusalem has come down to earth my hope is not in the old Jerusalem my hope is in the New Jerusalem my hope is not in an Old\n\n(37:05) Jerusalem down here on Earth my hope is in a New Jerusalem that comes down from heaven that God himself has built I go to prepare a place for you and I will come and take you to myself that that you may be where I am also isn't that what he said so who built the New Jerusalem God built the New Jerusalem\n\n(37:28) Jesus Built it and in the New Jerusalem everybody has a place so you have a city dwelling do you realize that with streets of gold City dwelling with the streets of gold prepared as a bride ad Dawn for a husband this is something unbelievable a whole city coming down with streets of gold so after Satan is\n\n(37:53) bound the holy city descends what happens then well there's of course a resurrection Revelation 20:7 and when the thousand years are expired Satan will be loosed out of his prison now there's one thing you must remember again the last arm of Revelation is a kaym the events are Written In Reverse to meet in the middle\n\n(38:19) the great climax of The Book of Revelation so the events are described in reverse of course it reads uh one after the other when the thousand years are expired Satan will be loosed from his prison there's a second Resurrection all the wicked are there again he has Napoleon by his side AR of Hitler is over there they're all ready\n\n(38:42) to go and shall go out to deceive the Nations which are on the four quarters of the earth Gog and Magog okay interesting to gather them together to a battle the number of whom is as the Sands of the sea he has a huge Army and he sees the New Jerusalem which if you take the size of it is approximately an area the size of\n\n(39:12) Poland in fact when I gave lectures in Poland they said Poland will be the place because it's exactly the size of the New Jerusalem of course the city is as high as it is wide what exactly the city will look like I don't know you can imagine it maybe a city that is as high as it is wide as it is long it could be a\n\n(39:39) cube what else could it be it could also be a pyramid couldn't it I don't know which it's going to be I haven't seen the New Jerusalem I can't wait to see it but I know that Satan loves pyramids and he is a copycat so maybe maybe it's a pyramid it's just a thought you know it's not a Doctrine it's just a thought I don't\n\n(40:00) know what it's going to look like I'm going to be excited to see what it looks like Gog and Magog now there's a whole chapter in The Book of Ezekiel regarding Gog and Magog and it is a typology of the destruction of Satan and his host that's what it is to gather them together to battle the number of whom is\n\n(40:19) as the sand of the sea and they went up on the bread of the Earth encompassed the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved city which city the New Jerusalem with the Saints in it and outside the city on an earth that is still defiled what has been cleansed by Jesus coming down and touching a great plane on which is now the city so they\n\n(40:45) Camp about the SI City the Beloved City and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them they're going to be destroyed there's going to be another battle called Gog and Magog and and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone so finally which part of Babylon gets its\n\n(41:06) deal the dragon the Demonic host where where the Beast and the false prophet the r is cursive see it's cursive that means it's not in the original it's very interesting where the Beast and the false prophet that just tells us where they were cast before they've been destroyed once already they're all standing there now again\n\n(41:31) because they're part of the second Resurrection but now the whole lot of them are going to be destroyed and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever so now there's going to be a burning hell forever and ever well we'll have to figure that one out Jesus comes and there's a harvest Revelation 20111\n\n(41:51) and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven f fled away and there was found no place for them so when this Throne arises Mighty things happen and I saw the dead now remember we're reading the events backwards because of the kaym so actually when you read the story in\n\n(42:14) Revelation there's a wall a holy city is surrounded and then there is a resurrection remember I told you you must read it backwards the kism tells us we must actually read it a resurrection the people in hordes surround the city a judgment a destruction so and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books\n\n(42:38) were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works so each one is confronted exactly with why he didn't make it and the Sea gave up the dead which were in the dead and Hell delivered up the dead\n\n(42:54) see we're reading the events back backwards so actually there's first the resurrection then there is the judgment and then there is the war and the destruction and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and Hell delivered hell means Hades the grave delivered up the dead which were in them\n\n(43:11) and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death ah we have a clue the lack of fire is the second death now what happened to at the first death they died what'll happen at the second death they die and whoever was not found written in\n\n(43:35) the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire good Isaiah 45:22 let's look at this judgment look unto me and be saved all the ends of the Earth for I am God and there is none else I have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall\n\n(43:58) bow every tongue shall swear so those people who oppose God what will they have to do they will have to confess that he's King and that they were wrong every one of them every tongue shall swear surely shall one say in the Lord have I righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are\n\n(44:18) incensed against him shall be ashamed that day is going to come Romans 14:11 for it is written as I live says the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God the wicked is reserved to the day of Destruction they are brought forth to the day of wroth job 213 they're going to be destroyed this\n\n(44:44) battle of Gog and Magog when does this take place so the Battle of Gog and Magog is a totally different battle to the battle of Armageddon two battles Armageddon takes place when at the second coming of Christ Gog and Magog takes place after the Millennium Gogan Magog means concealed means hidden Mystery if you\n\n(45:14) like and they went up on the breaths of the Earth encompassed the camp of the Saints about in The Beloved City Revelation 29 so the wicked are judged they raised they're judged and Satan looks at the hosts that he has surround him and he gathers a little bit of strength and he says let's go for it let's go for it and what happens fire\n\n(45:41) came down from God out of heaven and devoured them Revelation 22:9 they are destroyed in fire how long does this fire burn fire rains down from heaven Psalms 37:20 into smoke they shall consume away the fire shall devour them Psalms 21:9 there's Perfect Harmony in the Bible you can go through it this is the\n\n(46:13) second death Revelation 2014 why does God do this well firstly they'll have to give an account for what they have done in their lives secondly they will have to acknowledge that God loved them that are there in the city because they often persecuted them they burnt them they crushed their heads against the Rocks they had the\n\n(46:43) inquisitions they slaughtered them relentlessly they will have to acknowledge that God loved them and there's one other thing what about that that one that you think should have made it the Judgment reveals that he shouldn't have made it but you think well if only if only if only he could have seen or she could\n\n(47:07) have seen maybe they wouldn't have been so antagonistic towards God but when they are resurrected you'll see that same animosity and hatred in that face as in all the other faces and you will realize once and for all wow God knows what he's doing and these shall go away into Everlasting punishment but the righteous\n\n(47:33) into life eternal Matthew 25:46 now we have to deal with the doctrine of everlasting punishment is God going to burn them forever and ever then how do you explain that they consume away what does it mean in the Hebrew mindset Everlasting punishment let's go to Revelation 14 141 and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up\n\n(47:59) forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and His Image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name what does this mean forever and ever let's have a look at parallelism Psalms 92:7 when the wicked spring up Spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they\n\n(48:26) shall be destroyed forever so the Bible has to be in harmony with itself so they will be destroyed forever for it is the day of the Lord's Vengeance and the year of recompenses for the controversy of Zion there will come a recompense and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into Brimstone and the\n\n(48:51) land thereof shall become a burning pitch it shall not be quench night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up forever from generation to generation it shall lie waste None Shall Pass through it forever and ever Isaiah 348 to10 is there a contradiction well let's go to Jude 7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the\n\n(49:19) cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth as an ex example suffering the Vengeance of Eternal fire are Sodom and Gomorrah still burning no so what has happened is the fire has burnt until Sodom and Gomorrah is what gone and the\n\n(49:44) consequences are how long etal Eternal go to Peter second Peter 2:6 turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that should live ungodly so here's a type when these cities were burnt the consequences are forever well that's maybe not enough for\n\n(50:11) most people so let's go into this unquenchable fire Jeremiah might give us a clue Jeremiah 17:27 but if you will not hearken unto me to hallow the Sabbath day and not to bear burden even entering in at the Gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day then will I Kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall Devour\n\n(50:36) the Palaces of Jerusalem and it shall not be quenched there's an unquenchable fire this fire will be set aite and it shall not be quenched there's a typology of an unquenchable fire let's go to Jeremiah 521 12-13 now in the fifth month and the 10th day of the month which was the 19th year of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon\n\n(51:05) came neb Saran captain of The God Who served the king of Babylon into Jerusalem and burnt the house of the Lord there it was set on fire and the King's house and all the houses of Jerusalem and all the houses of the Great Men burned he with fire so this unquenchable fire was set in motion 2 Chronicles 36:1\n\n(51:28) 19-21 takes this analogy and says and they burnt the house of God just explaining what happened and broke down the walls of Jerusalem and burnt all the Palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the Godly vessels the goodly vessels thereof and them that had escaped from The Sword carried the away to Babylon\n\n(51:48) where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia to what to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah so in other words when Jeremiah said it's going to be burning with unquenchable fire here it says it was fulfilled when they burnt the house of God correct or not is that fire still\n\n(52:13) burning no the consequences thereof how long Eternal until the land had enjoyed the Sabbath for as long as she laid desolate she kept the Sabbath to fulfill three score and 10 years so Malachi 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven unquenchable fire and all the proud yeah and all that do\n\n(52:38) wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up says the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch Malachi 4:1 Malachi 4 4: three and you shall tread down the wicked they shall be what under your souls of your feet ashes so is there an everlasting hell on this planet yes or\n\n(53:08) no no no would that be in accordance with the character of God no so imagine this when I was a Roman Catholic and they told me that my mother was going to burn in hell forever and ever and ever and ever because she wasn't the Catholic turned me off God completely now I see that there will be a fire yes\n\n(53:32) unquenchable until it has completed what its burning and the consequences will be for how long forever and ever there will be ashes under your feet and there will be tears yes I don't believe tears are over until everything has been restored the Lord knoweth how to deliver The Godly out of temp ation and to\n\n(53:55) reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished second Peter 2:9 would I be happy let's say my mother didn't make it I believe God's going to judge her by the light that she has and I have every hope of seeing her in the kingdom of God but let's say she doesn't make it and let's say I do make\n\n(54:17) it would I be happy if I saw her burning in Hell forever and ever and would it be fair of God to burn someone forever and ever and ever for a life of 80 years of apostasy yes or no no it's a it is a horrendous Doctrine it is a it is a disgrace to the character of God it's a Roman Catholic Doctrine it's a pagan Doctrine it's not a\n\n(54:43) Biblical Doctrine but it can be read if you distort the texts and you do not take the parallelisms that are in the Bible what happens to Satan I will destroy thee Oh covering cherub therefore I will bring forth a fire in the midst of thee it shall devour thee and I will bring thee to ashes upon the Earth Ezekiel 28 16 and 18 what happens\n\n(55:12) to the devil and his angels it's going to be destroyed for how long forever so the sin question will be dealt with forever and ever and ever he's going to be gone and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with\n\n(55:41) them and be their God and they shall see his face Revelation 23 224 God is going to set up a kingdom here on this earth now all that's happened up until now is the holy city has come down there's been a resurrection it's been a judgment all the wicked of all the ages plus all the demons plus Satan himself are dead Satan\n\n(56:12) is going to die Eternal death and every Wicked one with him and then God will step out and the people follow him and they will walk on the ashes of the Dead the Earth will be burnt up will be made new and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away Revelation\n\n(56:39) 211 isn't this totally different to a Jerusalem and a millennium of Peace doesn't make any sense that Doctrine anymore so a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away revelation 21:1 nevertheless we according to the promise look for a new Heaven and a new Earth not an old Earth doed up no A New\n\n(57:05) Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 2 Peter 3:13 so after the millenum God will recreate the heavens and the Earth well the heavens could be the atmosphere that's pretty polluted it needs some cleansing at the end of the Millennium the holy city descends Satan attacks the wicked destroyed the earth\n\n(57:26) is made new that's the biblical Doctrine Revelation 211 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea you see the sea had separated the sea is salty and there's a whole host of geology and that I'm not going to deal with that right now but there will be\n\n(57:54) water huge Inland Lakes as big as oceans probably I don't know exactly what it's going to look like but it's going to be fantastic and it will be fresh water and it's going to look 10 billion times better than that and the leopard shall lie down with a kid they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain Isaiah\n\n(58:20) 1169 the lion shall eat what straw like the ox that's amazing and the bear and the cow shall graze together amazing if you look at the original diet of the animals in the world you will see that the plants of the of the earth were created for them as food after sin and death came in the animal kingdom changed some\n\n(58:49) of them became carnivore some of them became herbivores some of well some stayed herbivore others became scavengers that's a long series of things that happened there's a whole lecture coming up on the video series on that restoration from a scientific perspective it's very interesting what will happen then but\n\n(59:12) there will no be no more death and young people we can go up and Pat a lion and do whatever they like they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them Isaiah 65:23 where will the kingdom be here on this Earth after the\n\n(59:36) Millennium no Wicked whatsoever no animal that kills nothing like that anymore for beheld I create a new Heaven and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind Isaiah 65:17 there's going to be a total change on this planet and listen to this they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall\n\n(1:00:08) plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat my elect shall long enjoy the works of their hands how long forever okay so let me sum this up you will have a city dwelling in the New Jerusalem who built it God God is going to build you a house\n\n(1:00:40) Jesus Christ builds you a house wow and you're going to have a what dwelling a country dwelling who's going to build it you can build it just like you want it you can go to the greatest architect this universe has ever known and say what would you suggest and you can build it just like you want to what else are you going to\n\n(1:01:09) do there you're going to plant what you're going to plant Orchards and what you going to do you're going to eat them now I have been in so many houses in the last few years and everywhere I go I plant these stupid fruit trees boom and then before I get to eat them what happens I move I hate it with a\n\n(1:01:38) passion and when I drive past these houses where I used to live and I see this beautiful tree it freaks me out because I cannot even take one of those fruits without being a thief isn't that right what pathetic situation here I will have a home in the country I will plant my own things and I can eat them\n\n(1:02:02) now just think of that Israelite system wow what if I go for a walk on the planet and I'm passing your ground and your ground and your ground may I eat absolutely what was the biblical law what was the typology law on the old planet when you pass through someone else's land you may eat as much as you like but\n\n(1:02:32) you may not what you may not Harvest you may not Harvest so will there be any fences no no more fences and I can pass through your land without you freaking out because you will love me and I will love you and I can see a fruit there and I can decide which one am I going to look this one looks absolutely perfect and\n\n(1:02:58) that one looks absolutely perfect so which of the absolutely perfect ones do I feel like eating it wouldn't bug you at all and I would take one and I would eat it and I would come up against all these animals animals that we haven't even seen there are so many extinct animals can you imagine it and we go for a walk\n\n(1:03:19) and we go into that rainforest and we go and look at all these creatures and what have you and we ride on these elephants that are huge or maybe even much Huger animals than that and we travel through and we look at all these things and if I have to gather to the New Jerusalem how quickly can I be there speed of light no that's much too\n\n(1:03:45) slow how quickly speed of thought how quickly did an angel come to Daniel when he was praying before you even asked he was there all right Phillip was next to the Chariot there's a typology and he was preaching to the Uno and in the next moment he was in a city hundreds of miles away how quickly did\n\n(1:04:16) it go like that so will there be any more separation you say to your family I'm going to Andromeda today it's 40 billion zillion miles away well have a nice day off you go and then the question comes uh are you the home for lunch would you like me to be home for lunch absolutely all right hello I'm here for\n\n(1:04:47) lunch it'll be fantastic no more speed boundaries none of these things anymore any more I will eat the fruit that I have planted I will plant my Vineyards each one will have his place in the country and believe you me if I took the entire population of the world today did you know that they would fit\n\n(1:05:10) into just the northern part of Florida did you know that the entire world population today would fit into that tiny little spot so we're not really overpopulated it's just the Earth isn't such a mess imagine if the whole earth is restored will everybody have enough space even if you calculate from the\n\n(1:05:33) beginning All Through the Ages there will be ample space and the New Jerusalem by the way if you calculate the amount of space in that there will be enough space to accommodate any everyone who has ever lived so God really doesn't want anyone to be be lost he's not going to make the New Jerusalem small thinking only of those that will\n\n(1:06:01) be there the New Jerusalem will be big enough for everyone that has ever lived unfortunately angels will have to occupy some space it's very sad because it depends on our choice but this new world is something else no death no pain no nothing it will be fantastic and they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain says the\n\n(1:06:32) Lord you know something else the Bible says that the redeemed are those that follow the lamb wheresoever he goeth doesn't it say that all right is God nailed down or is he mobile he's mobile he has a whole universe out there do you you think it's there for twinkling what do you think is in that Universe there will be huge numbers\n\n(1:07:05) zillions of Worlds out there all under his control unfallen and as the king of the universe where will he go everywhere and who gets to go along we do we are representative of the most high telling people or whatever created beings out there what Christ has done for us telling them about his beautiful character telling them about\n\n(1:07:35) all the wonderful things that Jesus has done in our lives and what it was like to be sinful and lost and to be redeemed and sin will never raise its head again guaranteed and the redeemed will stand as a Bastion and a reproof to sin forever and ever and ever they will not hurt nor destroy ever in God's kingdom\n\n(1:08:07) ever again and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and the west and shall sit down in the Kingdom of Heaven Matthew 8:11 it's a beautiful Doctrine and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall All Flesh come to worship before me says the Lord Isaiah\n\n(1:08:31) 66:23 I thought the new moon festivals were done away with weren't they part of the ceremonial law why do we come together every new moon is there a new new Moon Festival and what other day do we come together every Sabbath so once a week we will go to the holy city and we won't trample on each other's\n\n(1:08:56) toes you'll all have your own dwelling and we go to Worship the Lord now what happens on the monthly Feast well I'm not absolutely sure what happens in the monthly Feast but I can guess it says there is a tree of life in the holy city and it Bears its fruits how often once a month once a month and it has how many different kinds of\n\n(1:09:27) fruits 12 so you even get a choice you don't like that one you can have that one right individuality freedom of choice I like that one and the leaves are for the healing of the Nations why that maybe there's a substance in the leaves which ensures perfect DNA function forever maybe there's a DNA restorer I don't\n\n(1:09:52) know what we're going to do with the leaves maybe we make tea from them maybe they taste better than chocolate I don't know but the leaves are obviously edible and delightful plus the fruit is delightful and it is a huge tree the Bible describes it as standing on both sides of the river which is Eden because Eden\n\n(1:10:16) has been Incorporated in the New Jerusalem wow so once a month we come together in a feast to celebrate eternity at the tree of life and once a week we come together to sing praises to our Heavenly King I cannot wait to be in heaven I cannot wait for the New Jerusalem I cannot wait for the kingdom of God and I hope that\n\n(1:10:44) all of you will be part of that Kingdom to [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:236_the_greatest_invitation_total_onslaught_walter_veith_www_loudcryministries_org_youtube.txt\n\n## Key Topics:\nChrist's Resurrection,Baptism's Meaning,Obedience to God,Christian Unity,Following Christ\n\n## Guide:\nThis sermon, \"The Greatest Invitation,\" delivered by Walter Veith, profoundly explores the meaning and significance of baptism within Christian faith. It asserts that baptism, specifically by immersion, symbolizes a spiritual death to an old, sinful life and a resurrection to a new life in Christ, emphasizing obedience to God's commands as an indispensable part of this transformation. Veith contrasts this biblical understanding with non-biblical practices like infant baptism and sprinkling, tracing their origins to pagan rituals and later Roman Catholic traditions. The core message underscores that true salvation, marked by belief, repentance, and baptism, leads to receiving the Holy Spirit and becoming an empowered member of Christ's unified church, a path that often demands personal sacrifice but promises eternal life and divine guidance.\n\n## Content:\n(2) 236 - The Greatest Invitation _ Total Onslaught - Walter Veith - www.loudcryministries.org - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Jif_oBwdTc\n\n\n\n(00:00) [Music] [Music] oh [Music] well I've titled this one the greatest invitation and uh this is an invitation that has gone out to mankind ever since the great events around Jesus's life in John 2: 19 Jesus says destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up now the Temple of course was a type and it served nearly as a type for\n\n(01:35) everything that Jesus stood for and uh in a sense we too can become part of a spiritual Temple which God is preparing and he says he who overcomes I will make a pillar in my house in my temple so there's a spiritual Temple that is being prepared but here Jesus is talking about a temple saying this Temple and in 3\n\n(02:04) days I will raise it up well the temple was quite magnificent here's a a replica of it that was built in miniature and you'll find this one in Jerusalem and the Jews answered him in John 2:20 then the Jews said 40 and6 years was this temple in building and will thou RAR it up in 3 days but he spake of the temp temp Le of his body so\n\n(02:32) Jesus was predicting that he would die and that in 3 days he would rise from the dead now the Jews used inclusive Reckoning so if he died before sunset on the Friday that was day one the Sabbath he rested in the grave and the first day of the week he rose and any portion of a day was considered a day so that was 3 days and\n\n(03:01) uh he spoke of his resurrection now if you go to Jerusalem you will find this Garden tomb where some claim Jesus lay and it looks highly probable that this is the right place and there's a Groove here and uh in this groove there must have been a giant Stone a giant flat stone that could be rolled away and\n\n(03:31) that's sort of what it looked like it's an interesting place they discovered this while doing some excavations and when they came across this they were stunned because everything fits so beautifully into place verse 22 says in John 2 when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said\n\n(03:54) this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said John 2:22 now what scripture were they referring to obviously the only scripture that there was was the Old Testament and so it referred to the Old Testament in the book of Isaiah there's a beautiful story of the Messiah and how\n\n(04:17) he would suffer and how he would die and how he would be crucified amongst criminals and uh they must have referred to those scriptures John 2 verse 22 1 Corinthians 15417 and 18 take this resurrection and tells us what the significant is and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching in vain all the other\n\n(04:48) great religions of the world serve at the tombs of their Founders but not Christianity the tomb of Christ is empty and so it says if Christ is not risen then our preaching is in vain and your faith also is in vain and if Christ be not raised your faith is in vain you are yet in your sins because only through the death and the\n\n(05:18) resurrection of Christ can my sins be forgiven and this is something that the world must understand because there is this movement today to join up all religions as if they were on the level with each other but if you remove this sentence then salvation becomes meaningless then they also which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished so\n\n(05:47) in other words those that died in Christ are waiting for the resurrection which is guaranteed through the death and the resurrection of Christ he was the first fruits of that Resurrection how could he be the first fruits if the Bible says that others were raised by Christ himself and the Book of Jude implies that Moses was\n\n(06:15) raised well the fact of the matter is there are people in heaven that never died like Elijah or like Enoch and uh what about them if Christ is the first fruits there was the way offering and Christ the first fruits Rose together with the graves that were opened and a number of people were raised from the\n\n(06:38) dead at the resurrection of Christ what about all them Christ is the guarantor in other words even if people were translated before the death of Christ it was under the for knowledge that Christ would die and be raised from the dead and overcome sin so they their salvation depends just as much on the\n\n(07:06) death and resurrection of Christ as ours does this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and for knowledge of God you see the forn knowledge God knew that he would succeed could he have failed yes he could have he was fully human and he was fully Divine but he never used his divinity once to protect\n\n(07:33) himself not once and so in his human form in his Humanity he could have failed but he succeeded where Adam failed so this Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and forn knowledge of God you crucified and killed by the hands of Lawless men but God raised him up having loosed the pangs of death so only in Christ is their\n\n(08:04) salvation amen because it was not possible for him to be held by it this Jesus God raised up and of that we are all witnesses can we be Witnesses today of the resurrection of Christ yes or no yes we can yes we can because only in Christ do you find find the type of transformation that we see in people who\n\n(08:34) have accepted him and follow him in all his ways without him it is impossible so Christ must be alive and if you walk with him and you will have an experience with him then you will know that he's not rotting in some grave but that he is the one who rose from the dead and sits at the right hand of the\n\n(08:56) father and then after the resurrection Direction Jesus gives the commission go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost the full Trinity the full power of the godhead teaching them to observe what does it say all things whatsoever I have commanded at\n\n(09:29) you and lo I Am With You Always even unto the end of the world and this commission is all encompassing you cannot leave out a portion here and a portion there you must teach everything so a relationship here that culminates in baptism is based on truth it is based on the word because what Christ taught them either through the\n\n(09:58) prophets or personally is the word of God and uh we cannot take portions of it we have to take all of it observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you did Christ speak through the prophets in the past yes or no absolutely all things were created by Him and for him and nothing was created that was not created\n\n(10:26) by Him so everything from the beginning comes from Christ baptism is mentioned 80 times in the New Testament would you think that that was important then I would think so it's not just a fleeting thing 80 times it is mentioned John 3:23 says and John also was baptizing speaking about John the Baptist and you know near to\n\n(10:56) Salim that's another form for jerus M because there was much water there so for baptism do you need a little bit of water do you need a fair amount of water you need a fair amount of water John 3:23 so what does it mean to baptize the Greek word is bapo which means to dip to immerse to plunge underwater and there must be a\n\n(11:29) specific meaning to this as well because God does not do anything haphazardly everything that God does and says has a meaning has a deep spiritual meaning God is not a god of the just Soul so to baptize means to put under water and this is the Jordan River and this is where John the Baptist baptized\n\n(11:58) because because there was much water there Matthew 3:5 and 6 says then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were baptized of him in Jordan confessing their sins now what is sin we've learned about that what was that transgression of the law so people who did not live in harmony\n\n(12:27) with God came here confessed their sins and the baptism was a symbol of the washing away of sin and they came and they reasoned and John the Baptist spoke wishy-washy words or plain and cutting words plain and cutting words and then eventually Jesus himself came to John the Baptist and John the Baptist\n\n(12:57) knew that Jesus was the Messiah and he said to Jesus I will not baptize you you must baptize me I'm not worthy to to loosen or tie or shoelaces and Jesus said let it be so now it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness then John consented now we have a question here if baptism is a symbol of the\n\n(13:27) washing away of sin one of the symbols was it necessary for Jesus to be baptized did he have any sin no no he says the devil is coming and he has how much on me nothing nothing not one sin Jesus was the sinless Spotless Son of God why was it necessary then to fulfill all righteousness that Jesus also\n\n(13:59) submitted himself to the right of baptism because Jesus is not only our savior he's not only our God he's also our example and so Jesus sets an example and it is said in the Bible that if you follow Christ you should walk just as he walked so studying the Life of Christ is studying the Christian walk\n\n(14:29) and Christ was baptized amen and Jesus when he was baptized Matthew 316 he went up out of the water what does that tell us how he was baptized under water he must have been under the water that's what it says so Jesus was under the water at that moment heaven was opened and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and liting on him\n\n(15:02) so the spirit of God descended not as a dove but like a dove now how does a Doug Dove descend gently gently and a voice from Heaven said this is my son whom I love at cnv or this is my beloved Son King James version with him I am well pleased Matthew 3:16 And1 17 whenever someone is baptized that same privilege is his or hers amen when\n\n(15:40) you are immersed then the same thing happens the Holy Spirit descends like a dove and God says this is my beloved son or daughter in whom I am well pleased so that Dove does not necessarily literally mean a dove but the attributes of a dove are what we will find in the function of the holy spirit that is something that uh is\n\n(16:14) worthy of study God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power now the word power there implies the means the mechanisms the tools if you like to put it bluntly and simply to do everything that he was going to do because he being fully human yet fully Divine was not going to use his divinity to his own advantage and in\n\n(16:45) all things he was tempted such as we were so he tapped into the same power that we can tap into who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for God was with him acts 10: 38 so in the power of the Holy Spirit he went out doing good and preaching the gospel of Salvation in him for the next 3 and a\n\n(17:17) half years now the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John so John the Baptist wasn't the only one who was baptizing and it it says Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples but the disciples baptized people after John now the question here arises again why did Jesus not\n\n(17:43) baptize because he's the one that is typified in the baptism he set as an example but his disciples were the ones that baptized thereafter John 4 one and two now something else that's interesting about baptism and the type of questions that arise around baptism because today it is believed that all you have to do is just say here I am I'm\n\n(18:16) ready you baptized yourself and basically Christ paid it all and we can live as before but Jesus placed people under grace and then referred them back to obedience do you remember that we've mentioned it before the classical case was Mary Magdalene neither do I condemn you being placed under grace go and sin no more\n\n(18:41) being placed again under the law now in this particular instance there was this uh high official he was the treasurer of uh a queen he was a Uno he was a black man probably and he was traveling through the desert he had been to Jerusalem so he was a Jew he was a devout Jew and he was reading the Bible\n\n(19:12) the Torah when Phillip was sent to him acts 8: 26-28 and the angel of the Lord spake unto Phillip saying arise and go towards the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza which is Desert and he Rose and went that's also if God speaks do it and behold a man of Ethiopia a Uno of great\n\n(19:37) Authority Under Candice Queen of the Ethiopians who had charge of all her Treasures so he was the Minister of Finance that's what he was but he was a Jew because he had come to Jerusalem for to worship it was the Passover and so he came to worship on that particular day was he therefore acquainted with the rights and laws and\n\n(20:06) judgments of the Jewish system yes or no yes and he was a devout Jew he had come to worship so he knew everything about the Old Testament do you think he knew the Ten Commandments absolutely he knew the Ten Commandments and he came to worship and he was returning and sitting in his Chariot and he was reading Isaias\n\n(20:35) the prophet acts 8: 26-28 and so philli comes up to him sits is invited up onto the Chariot and he talks to him and he says to him what are you reading and he says I'm reading Isaiah the prophet and uh he says to him do you know what you are reading and he reads a passage of scripture and it talks about the lamb that was taken\n\n(21:04) before its sharers and who opened not his mouth and was led to the slaughter and Philip asked him do you know what this is about and interestingly the Uno says how can I unless someone explains it to me that's fascinating God operates like this he works through people and he forms people of Truth fire his people and here was a\n\n(21:33) devout Jew he was studying the book and he was seeking to find an answer and Phillip was there to supply it Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet ofas and said understandest thou what thou readest and he said how can I except some man should guide me different translation say should explain it to me\n\n(22:01) and he desired Phillip that he would come up and sit with him the place of the scripture where he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his sherff so opened he not his mouth and so philli explained it to him what was the one thing this Jew lacked he had the law he had the Torah he knew\n\n(22:26) what it was to be obedient and to keep God's precepts but what didn't he know he didn't know who the Messiah was and so Jesus was introduced to him by Phillip and when he realized that when he realized that this sheep was the one that was being slaughtered that it was the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world\n\n(22:54) that is when he said to Phillip as they traveled along the road they came to some water and the Uno said look here is water why shouldn't I be baptized and he ordered the Chariot to stop he knew the law he knew the Torah and now he found the treasure of Heaven he found Jesus Christ amen the Savior and so he says why should I shouldn't I\n\n(23:28) be baptized now this whole section in the book of Acts is written in a chastic structure which means answer or question answer question answer question answer now if you have an NIV Bible or if you have any of the modern translations of the Bible you will be hardpressed to find this verse because your Bible will have verse\n\n(23:55) 36 and verse 38 but it'll leave out verse ver 37 check it tonight if you want to acts 8:37 and philli said the question was what hinders me from being baptized and Philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest very important answer so what was the prerequisite to baptism believe in my\n\n(24:25) heart believe with all thine heart why do you think some Modern translations prefer to leave that verse out and also say at the bottom that it was not in the original text but the kaym which is a question answer question answer question answer would be destroyed if you left that text out and so that text as it stands in the King\n\n(24:50) James version and in some good translations should be there amen and it says if th believe with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God now remember he was a Jew Jesus said teaching them what do you remember it all things whatsoever I have commanded you all things if you love me\n\n(25:28) keep my Commandments today we have people who do know not know anything about the requirements of God and they accept Jesus as their Savior and think they can walk on as before without coming into harmony with the precepts of God so the Jews had the law and they didn't have the Messiah today we want\n\n(25:52) the Messiah and we don't want the law it's rather confusing in actual fact those that keep the Commandments of God and have the faith of Jesus that is what the Bible says is the group that stands for the whole gospel because why did Jesus die for us because we were in transgression does that mean we stay in\n\n(26:19) transgression of course not so it's very important if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said said I believe that Jesus is the son of God this is what he lacked he didn't know the Messiah and when he accepted the Messiah as his personal savior he was baptized and then both\n\n(26:41) Philip and the unoch went down into the water and Phillip baptized him acts 8:36 to 38 so in all the examples that we have we see that the Bible talks about a bapt baptism and that it is a baptism of immersion now if we go to the early church you will see that the early church also baptized by immersion here\n\n(27:09) is a Byzantine cross and an old Byzantine church and uh this one is in ruins of course and if you walk through these ruins there is an ancient baptismal font where they baptized these people there's a close up you can see it over there you went down the steps and uh that's where they baptized so the early church after\n\n(27:39) Christ baptized by immersion this one over here is an interesting one this is also a Byzantine church this was built there where the een used to live and uh these early churches all had baptismal fonts with steps leading down this is in the desert where there isn't much water so they had a smaller font but baptism\n\n(28:03) by immersion is certainly possible in a font like this if you go to the ancient churches they also revealed the method that was used in previous times this is the first century Church in Philippi this was the baptismal font where people were baptized and uh if you ask yourself where does the baptism by sprinkling or\n\n(28:29) by infusion pouring the water over the forehead of an infant comes from well then you have to go to Rome to find out because this is where it stems from and even if you go to some of the older churches in Rome you still find large baptismal fonts and uh here in capadia and turkey the hidden city of some Christians in\n\n(28:55) the Middle Ages there you also find baptism by immersion and they had these deep baptismal fonts where you went down the stairs and were baptized by immersion some of the reliefs and some of the paintings that we have of that early period if we go to Russia for example here's the baptism of the Russian King Vladimir the Great a\n\n(29:21) painting of that by the early uh Byzantine church today the Orthodox church is a remnant of that also baptism by immersion and here's an early relief of uh Christ being baptized by in an African Fresco and there you have also him standing under the water and he's the water coming up to his waist so where does this infant baptism then come\n\n(29:51) from if the Bible speaks about baptism by immersion and if the Bible says even if you believe with your whole heart then you may can an infant believe with his whole heart can an infant make a decision yes or no who makes the decision for the infant the parents make the decision for the infant and the infant that cannot\n\n(30:22) make up its mind yet that doesn't have the capacity to understand is covered by the parents the New Testament says Paul says that if you have a marriage and just one of the individuals is in Christ then the husband is Sanctified by the faith of the wife or the wife is Sanctified by the father or else what does it say your\n\n(30:54) children would be unclean fascinating text in other words when we look at infants and small children the responsibility for their nurturing and for their growth and for their final capacity to make a decision by themselves rests with the parents and Jesus did what to Little Children he blessed them he said suffer\n\n(31:23) not the little children to come unto me and he blessed them and he for reprimanded his U disciples when they tried to keep the infant away from them but this infant baptism is not biblical it comes from an ancient right it comes from Babylon because infants were dedicated via this system in the past they even\n\n(31:49) took infants some rights and immersed the whole infant but uh most of them actually just in infused or sprinkled in the 6th Century ad we have the introduction of infant baptism now the god Janos who was the two-headed one the one that looks forward and backwards we have the same in the two-headed eagle that's where it\n\n(32:15) comes from was twice born holy water was used for baptism and it was made by taking a torch from The Altar and plunging it into water which then became holy water and uh today it is the same sort of thing they take a candle in some rights from the altar plunge it into the water and it symbolizes the sun god\n\n(32:41) plunging into the Waters of the womb to be reborn as Horus the Savior so that's where this ritual comes from and where holy water comes from the following curse was pronounced on Roman Catholic Church defectors May the son who suffered for us curse him May the Holy Spirit who suffered for us in baptism curse him let\n\n(33:14) him be a cursed who says adults must be baptized this is history of romanism page 510 so Rome introduced infant baptism to come into harmony with the ancient Pagan rights now by the way you can see where this actually comes from because in the Pagan right the Holy Spirit and Horus are all one entity you know the dove was the symbol\n\n(33:46) of the female aspect of the deity so if you look at luciferian worship then Lucifer is both male female you know and the Dove and he is also regarded as the holy spirit that we read in Alice a Bailey's books and what is interesting here is that it says because they're all one may the Holy Spirit who suffered for us in baptism\n\n(34:16) curse him did the Holy Spirit suffer in baptism in the Bible yes or no no the Holy Spirit descended gently like a love on Jesus who was the one who was going to suffer and die Jesus was going to suffer the and die and certainly the baptism that took place does not reflect this baptism but reflects the plunging and the death of\n\n(34:46) the son God but not of Jesus Christ so the curse by Roman Catholicism that you are cursed if you stand for adult baptism tells us where it comes from Cardinal James Gibbon the Faith of Our Fathers answers this question or answered that question for several centuries after the establishment of Christianity baptism was conferred by\n\n(35:16) immersion so the Rome admits it that total immersion was the way in which baptism took place but since the 12th century the practice of baptizing by infusion that's pouring the water over the foret has prevailed in the Catholic church as this manner is attended with less inconvenience than baptism by\n\n(35:40) imersion does that make much sense no that doesn't make much sense at all John 3:3 says verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of heaven so this Born Again represents a dying and a resurrection and baptism stands for that death and that Resurrection one that we experience in\n\n(36:09) Christ it was not until the Council of Ravena in 1,311 ad that sprinkling and pouring were officially accepted as equally valid as immersion in the right of baptism so the Pagan rights were brought in gently gently gently and today they are there they are entrenched and if you don't follow them then you are a\n\n(36:38) cursed so like with all the strange doctrines that we have in the Christian world today we have to go to Rome to find them this system where church and state works together to bring about one Unitarian form of religion which will be the ultimate worship of the angel with a torch the Fallen one Lucifer well Rome is very impressive\n\n(37:10) very spectacular this is the statue of Moses that was made by Michelangelo and it has a little notch in the knee and uh they tell us that Michelangelo looked at the Statue and said it was perfect and then he threw his chisel at it and said get up but of course it didn't get up it just got a kink in the in the knee\n\n(37:36) that's the story whether it's true or whether it's not the great pontea Maximus the great bridge builder to take the place of Jesus Christ the one who is the bridge between Heaven and Earth is certainly not the pontea Maximus but is Jesus Christ so with all these systems we find that Rome is the one that is\n\n(37:58) behind it and it's the one that's receiving the accolades and the worship today it is claimed that infant baptism brings the infant into the family of God and uh then they claim that this is the New Covenant which covers the whole family baptism is as a consequence of accepting Jesus Christ as your personal\n\n(38:27) Savi learning all the precepts of Christ accepting them realizing that we are sinners living in transgression to God's law and that our only hope is to have this blot washed away in the blood of the lamb and then walking in harmony with Christ in his power through him that's what it's all about and infants\n\n(38:54) just cannot do that here's a little infant font that you will find in the Vatican there is no room for any immersion in that the Bible says in Ephesians 4:5 one Lord One Faith one baptism how many baptisms do we have out there in the world many many many different rights of baptism some baptize by immersion the\n\n(39:26) Baptist for example Baptist by immersion others practice infant baptism by sprinkling others practice infant baptism by infusion others practice no baptism at all with water but claim just a spiritual baptism some practice baptism in by immersion by dunking once some practice B baptism by immersion by dunking three\n\n(39:59) times in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and some practice baptism by immersion seven times which one of those is right the Bible says there's one Lord One Faith one baptism surely it should be quite simple to resolve the issue you have to go to the reference source isn't that right and what is the reference\n\n(40:27) Source the Bible then why don't people take the standard of the Bible follow the dictates of the Bible and then we should have one baptism isn't that right how many times does it say did Jesus go under the water once does it say anywhere that the Uno went under a couple of times yes or no no so it should be possible to have one right in\n\n(40:56) fact any Doctrine in the Bible should be discerned by following the same method if a says this way is the way and that one says no this one and this one says no that one and the churches are splitting all the time on these issues surely we should be able to go to the word of God and say well that's what the\n\n(41:20) word says let's do it that way and if you can find a church that says this is what the word says let's do it in every single aspect well then you would have one Lord One Faith one baptism but unfortunately we don't live in a world like that so let's have a look at the symbolism of baptism so we can see what it really\n\n(41:47) entails 1 Peter 3: 211 and this water symbolizes baptism that now SA saves you also not by the removal of dirt from the body but by the pledge of a good conscience towards God it saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen so when you are baptized what are you remembering res the resurrection of\n\n(42:20) Christ now the Christian world out there says we remember the resurrection of Christ by doing what what by keeping what by keeping Sunday that's not biblical that's not biblical you remember the resurrection of Jesus Christ by participating in baptism and you know what the Bible tells us something interesting it says you are baptized you\n\n(42:50) rise and you are baptized in Christ did Jesus also in Institute a mini baptism to remind us of this event yes he introduced foot washing and he said as often as you do this then do this in memory of me do what I tell you you will be blessed if you do this the foot washing is a min any baptism reminding us\n\n(43:31) of the washing of rebirth that we had in a sense you are going through life and uh picking up a little bit of dust here and a little bit of dust there and in the solemn right of communion when you participate in the body and the blood of Christ then the foot washing forms part of that and the Bible clearly says that\n\n(43:55) we should do this blessed are you if you do this and very few do that either I tell you the truth unless a man is born of water and spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God John 3:5 will the man on the cross the thief be in heaven one day yes or no yes was he baptized no no then how can this text be\n\n(44:25) true you see if you do not have an opportunity to do it God will judge the intent of the heart if you know and you do it not says the Bible then it be for you sin the time of ignorance God Winks at must take all these things into account I tell you the truth unless a man is born of water if you have the ability and you know you\n\n(44:59) must be born of water and the spirit without the spirit it is meaningless he cannot enter the kingdom of God this is serious John 3:5 so if we read on what happened in that early church when those conversions started taking place they were struck by the words of the disciples after they' crucified Christ and they said Brothers\n\n(45:25) what shall we do and Peter replied repent what does that mean turn around you were going this way go the other way you were in sin and transgression turn the other way and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ acts 2:37 and 38 in other words the issue at stake was that Jesus was the Messiah the\n\n(45:55) one whom they cruci ifed they broke the law by crucifying Christ because it says Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not murder and they did it so they had to repent they had to accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior and they had to be baptized Acts 2:38 and 39 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of\n\n(46:19) Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of sins and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the promises for you and your children and for all who are far off for all whom the Lord Our God will call now some claim this text to say it's fine to baptize little children it's not what it says it says that when you accept Christ\n\n(46:47) then you will be blessed according to the Old Testament for thousands of generations God takes heed of your decision and you give God the right to intercede in your life and to stand in the Hedge and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit so when you are baptized you are endowed with a special gift\n\n(47:13) before that you are prompted by the Holy Spirit you can be led by the Holy Spirit but now at your baptism you receive a gift of the Holy Spirit and This Promise is for you and your children because your children are covered by your decision and your faith and for all who are far off all people and for all whom\n\n(47:33) the Lord will call so it goes into all time 1 Samuel 15:22 says to obey is better than sacrifice so if God says this and if God says that we should repent and be baptized then that is the right thing to do Ephesians 41113 says and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting\n\n(48:02) of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ so what are these gifts for that God is going to impart during\n\n(48:28) baptism for the ministry for the ministry it is for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the body of Christ everybody receives a part and even the most humble person receives a part even those that have virtually no real magnificent abilities can be so blessed by God that they become powers and\n\n(48:58) Giants within the church some have the capacity to pray some have different gifts some have gifts of hospitality for that matter who's more important the one who makes someone feel at home and comfortable and Comforts people or the one who speaks the gospel who's more important the one is not more important\n\n(49:24) than the other can the one say to the other I have no need of thee Barnabas was known for his Gentle Spirit and for making people feel comfortable and that is just as important as any great gift or to be a uh evangelist or a pastor or a teacher whatever the gift is God gives to each according as he Wills for the edifying\n\n(49:52) of the body of Christ till we all come into Unity of the fath Faith now this tells us again that what we see out there in the world cannot be right you cannot have a thousand faiths or 2,000 or more there's one Faith one God one Faith one baptism until we all come into this harmony for as we have many members in\n\n(50:18) one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ now the body of Christ is the church the members of the body now can we be part and parcel of different bodies that teach different things yes or no well what do you say if there's one truth one baptism One Faith Can we have\n\n(50:44) different faiths and different teachings on issues that are purely not biblical when we check them in the Bible yes or no no surely we must come into harmony when it comes to the things of Faith so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another so it talks about unity in the\n\n(51:09) spirit having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us Romans 64-6 so God during baptism when you become part of the body of Christ you get endowed with the spirit and and empowered to do whatever it is God chose you to do within the body and we are his Witnesses of these things and so also is the Holy Ghost now\n\n(51:40) listen carefully acts 5 verse 32 whom God has given to them that what's it say there obey him so does everybody receive this gift of the Holy Spirit yes or no no you have to be obedient to the precepts of Christ otherwise this text cannot apply you have to be obedient to the precepts of Christ so in\n\n(52:12) other words the Uno was obedient to the precepts of the scriptures but he knew not who the Messiah was today if we accept Christ as our personal savior we also have to learn how to obey him yes or no you have to have both and this is a very important issue this will be a deciding factor at the end of time don't\n\n(52:34) you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death does that imply dying yes or no yes it implies dying and therefore when you go under the water you stop breathing and that symbolizes the death but if it remains\n\n(53:03) purely a symbol well then it's no real baptism at all if I die the death of the old man and I Rise the same old man is that a genuine baptism no no so if I'm not taught the precepts of Christ if I'm not taught how to come back into harmony with Christ then that death death and Resurrection is really quite meaningless\n\n(53:30) I have to know how to come into harmony with Christ don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death now do you know that the Muslim World accuses Christianity of being a crutch religion because all you have to do is\n\n(53:54) go on your knees and say well Lord forgive me and then you get up and you can do it again and you can go to uh let's say if you're Roman Catholic you can go to the priest and you can confess the sin and it's gone and then you can do it again and go back and confess it do it again go back and confess it and\n\n(54:14) you always have recourse to this confession and then if you are uh in sin when you die you get the last anointing even when you're dead and all that stuff is cleared away that's not Christianity that's paganism and it's not true Muslims say that if you commit something wrong you pay the price right there so if you're a\n\n(54:37) thief no more hand you lose it if you're a thief twice well then it's hard to steal you don't have any hands left in some of these countries so you pay for what you have done and therefore that is true payment for transgression Christianity is a crutch religion they say and false Christianity is because\n\n(55:03) people misuse the grace of Christ as an excuse to carry on a lifestyle that they had before isn't that right but true Christianity requires the death penalty to such an extent that you die and are buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory\n\n(55:33) of the father we too may live a what does it say then New Life new life I cannot live the old life Romans 6 3 and 4 I have to be transformed so when I receive the knowledge of the Son of God who died for me and I am taught all things whatsoever he has commanded and I accept that I am in transgression to God's law and I accept\n\n(56:07) the gift of Salvation in Jesus Christ and I am baptized buried with Christ in baptism so when Jesus died potentially all mankind died with him and and when he rose potentially all mankind rose with him but God honors our freedom of choice and when we choose to follow him we enact that ritual of Dying In Christ and\n\n(56:45) rising in Christ and we receive a new life reborn and unless we receive this new life we are not safe we have to come into harmony with Christ and Christ kept his father's Commandments yes or no so must we keep them yes so obedience is a prerequisite people don't want that today they want cheap Grace they say all I need to do is\n\n(57:23) believe and I am saved yes you have to believe but if there is no obedience then you are transgressor of God's law and if you break one you break them all all and you will be judged by the law and you won't have an intercessor Jesus says to those that say but Lord Lord did we not in that day do this and that and\n\n(57:51) the other and cast out demons and do whatever it takes Jesus said says to them depart from ye me ye that work and then he uses the word anomia which literally means against the law of God today in the world out there you have a Doctrine which is called an nomianism which means doing away with the law of God\n\n(58:17) anomia you cannot have one without the other you can't have salvation in Christ and then not come back into harmony with what he died for you why he died for you to save you so in order that we live this new life we must be reborn I'll tell you something if you really become a Christian and you really follow Christ\n\n(58:44) in all his ways and you are baptized and you rise in Christ and in him through him you walk the Life of Christ nobody will recognize you your old friends will say who are you I do not know you I don't want to be with you anymore go away I guarantee it I lost all my old friends when I became baptized when I started\n\n(59:15) walking with the Lord and coming back into harmony with his precepts all my friends were gone I didn't want to drink with them anymore I was a spoil sport in a sense because I didn't want to do the things I did before and uh my own own family didn't recognize me anymore so that is the type of new life\n\n(59:38) that you must lead but thank God there are many many friends that you make and there's a new family so death to our old sinful way of life that's very important otherwise it is not the real thing the burial of our sins in the the watery grave of baptism and a resurrection to a new life in Christ one that is in harmony with the\n\n(1:00:05) precepts of Christ 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature totally new totally new old things are passed away behold all things are become new totally different can can it cause turmoil in a home if one accepts and the other one doesn't the old husband doesn't recognize you the the wife doesn't\n\n(1:00:36) recognize the husband who are you I don't know you you're so different you've totally changed what's happened and many times they don't want to know you and only prayer and patience and kindness can deal with an issue like that knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin\n\n(1:01:01) transgression of the law that's the definition that's the only one in the Bible might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin it's very clear Romans 6:6 so Jesus Paid It All there's nothing I can do nobody can keep the law of God in any case it's impossible is that biblical yes or no well is it biblical or no no we must\n\n(1:01:27) not serve sin can I do it in My Own Strength no only in Christ but I can stop stealing I can stop lying I can stop cheating I can stop looking where I shouldn't look because I have power over this neck don't I likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin if you want to be dead to sin must\n\n(1:02:00) you know what sin is yes by the law is the knowledge of sin says the Bible so if I want to be dead to sin must I know the law yes or no yes so you see today we have a totally different problem to what the unoch had he knew the law but he didn't know Christ today we know Christ but we don't know the La law and\n\n(1:02:27) so we have to come into a fullness of the stature of Christ so dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so we die with Christ in the right of baptism are raised a new person spanking new shining new Now new if you have a new car how many dents does that have when you buy\n\n(1:02:55) it in fact if you get take your brand new car into commission and you see a little scratch there what do you say to the salesman hey what's that after 20 years driving with a thing who cares you know about that scratch but you're very fussy about your new car right well that's what it's like it's spanking you how\n\n(1:03:23) many faults May there be in that car what happens if you drive down the road and you what's the matter here right isn't the supposed to be new new means new totally new person how many dents how many sins how many whatever is in that new individual not one they're all gone you stand before God as though you had never\n\n(1:03:51) sinned I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live I died but I'm alive yet not I but Christ liveth in me so if I boast and say I have the power to do this now and I have the power to do that now that's not biblical either in Christ and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me\n\n(1:04:23) and gave himself for me Galatians 2 verse 20 it's fantastic it's fantastic I don't become a puppet of Christ Christ doesn't control me like a puppet and say you're a marionette you have to do whatever this and that and the other no I have freedom of choice and I choose to follow Christ and every single day the\n\n(1:04:45) devil will say to me why you doing that are you crazy look what I have to offer you but he's got a pile of potach he's got nothing and so I choose day by day to follow Christ so baptism commemorates Christ's death burial and Resurrection that's what it does secondly it symbolizes the death and the burial of the old man of sin thirdly it\n\n(1:05:14) represents the resurrection to newness of life in Christ Jesus and fourthly it indicates the washing away of sin Acts 22:16 that's what the right of baptism stands for that is the symbolism when you are raised what happened to Jesus the dove descended so when you are raised a new person in Christ then you receive the\n\n(1:05:50) gift of the spirit whatever it is as God Wills you know many sit in the church wondering what their gift is I don't have any gift nothing happened to me that I can remember if you're not willing to walk with Christ will you experience him yes or no many exercise their gift all their years all the years and don't even know\n\n(1:06:17) that they're exercising a gift whoever believes and is baptized will be saved Mark 16:16 this text is so misused today believes means everything you've got to believe everything if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest acts 8:37 Brothers what shall we do Peter replied repent that means come back into\n\n(1:06:44) harmony with the precepts of Christ and be baptized wash away be reborn every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ because only in him do we move and have our being and do we live then they that gladly received his word were baptized does that mean there were some that did not gladly receive his word sure many didn't and the same\n\n(1:07:09) day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls acts 2:41 so to the body of Christ there was added 3,000 Souls now today this is a mass baptism in the Jordan many people go to the Jordan to be baptized thousands upon thousands upon thousands go to be baptized and I wonder whether they understand the fullness of the\n\n(1:07:40) right of baptism it's nice to be baptized by immersion because that's a Biblical way and in fact the Seventh Day Adventist Church accepts the baptism by immersion by other churches if it was done in this biblic way and you can become a member by uh proclaiming Faith here's a young girl being baptized in a\n\n(1:08:05) lake and uh you know they say the Catholic Church said that it was less inconvenient to do it that way well Christ said it and I was stunned by this person uh I took this picture in Germany where this young lady was baptized what do you see there ice floating around wow wow that's determination to be\n\n(1:08:30) baptized wouldn't you agree that's determination let's have a look at the steps to Salvation and we'll look at them biblically number one you have to accept you have to accept the sacrifice of Christ you have to believe that he's the way the truth and the life and you have to believe that this is the way it\n\n(1:08:52) is done number three you must confess you must confess and there must be a decision Revelations 3:20 we must have all four these components Romans 3:23 says for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God everyone is sin has is a sinner therefore everyone must be born again in order to enter the kingdom of\n\n(1:09:19) heaven you must be a new person one that's back in harmony because you won't enter Heaven otherwise so you must be born again all have sinned acts 16:31 and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house the faith covers the children wonderful all have sinned I must accept it and I must\n\n(1:09:52) believe in the merits of Christ and I must confess my sins if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins so if I have a baptism without a confession is it valid no and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 1 John 1:9 and behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open\n\n(1:10:19) the door I will come into him and will sck with him and he with me Revelation 3:2 20 this is what I love about the character of God he doesn't Force anyone what does he do he stands at the door and knocks he doesn't Force his way in so what must you do in the final analysis you must accept the invitation\n\n(1:10:39) you must open the door and invite him into your life now we know what it stands for does it also mean that I become part of Christ's Church when I'm baptized for by one Spirit are we all baptized not 10 Spirits not 20 not a th000 not 2,000 one Spirit we are all baptized into how many bodies one body whether we\n\n(1:11:14) be Jews or Gentiles now remember the word Jews was used for the early Christians as well they were regarded still as Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit there's only one one truth there aren't 10 truths thousands of truths 1 Corinthians 12:13 so the Lord added to the\n\n(1:11:42) church daily such as should be saved acts 2:47 so when you accept the right of baptism when you accept Jesus as your personal savior when you are baptized you become part of the body of Christ and that body of Christ must be the one that teaches how many things all things for by one Spirit are we all baptized into how many bodies\n\n(1:12:13) one body and he is the head of the body the church Colossians 1:18 yes so baptism by immersion is personal but it is also corporate it means you become part of the body of Christ now what about rebaptism if you have been baptized let's say you've been baptized in a way that is not in accordance with\n\n(1:12:43) the entire biblical principle what that is rebaptism called for well let's read what happened in Acts 191 to5 Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to to Ephesus and finding sat's disciples he said unto them have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so they had accepted Christ they\n\n(1:13:08) were Believers and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto John's baptism now John preached the baptism of repentance but the baptism in Christ implies becoming part of the body of Christ and\n\n(1:13:31) receiving the gift empowering you to preach Christ then said Paul John very verily baptized with a baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him that is on Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Acts 19\n\n(1:13:55) 1 to 5 now again some denominations will say well that means we must only baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus but the Lord Jesus himself said baptize them in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit this is the Messianic portion yes you have to realize who the Messiah is but when you are baptized you\n\n(1:14:20) are baptized into the fullness of the godhead you know not just baptized proportionally or portion a portion of it without Christ there is no salvation but Christ and the father are what one you can't be baptized into the one without being baptized into the other it's impossible so baptism by immersion\n\n(1:14:48) rebaptism is called for if you feel that you've had a total biblical baptism then as I've said said the Seventh Day Adventist Church acknowledges that and you become part of the body that keeps the Commandments of God and has the testimony of Jesus by profession of Faith but if you feel that it is better\n\n(1:15:12) to be baptized into the full truth then baptism rebaptism is not unbiblical so God works through his church this is very very important acts 9:6 here's one of the greatest Disciples of Christ and he trembling and astonished says Lord what wil thou have me to do this is Paul himself Paul on the road to Damascus has a vision and he\n\n(1:15:44) sees Jesus Christ and he realizes he's in transgression he's persecuting Christ by persecuting his followers and he repents and he says what Willl thou have me do and the Lord says to him you know Paul I've called you to be an apostle to the Gentiles and I want you to go to all the parts of the world and\n\n(1:16:08) preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ nothing like that happened not even to the mighty Paul this is what happened and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou th must do isn't that fascinating God does not work outside his body he leads people he nurtures people\n\n(1:16:40) but in the final analysis he will lead them to the body and ananas went his way and entered into the house there was the disciple that God chose of the Brethren to tell Paul what he had to do and putting his hands on him he said brother Saul the Lord even Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest has sent me that thou\n\n(1:17:05) might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Ghost acts 9 verse 17 it's a very important text God does not raise up people outside to go and tell the body what to do he sends them to the body to be told what to do does that make sense sense so these are very important biblical principles whereby one can find\n\n(1:17:33) solidity in one's Faith here is the patience of the Saints here are they that keep the Commandments of God and the faith of Jesus Revelation 14:12 so at the end of time God would see to it that there would be a body that not only preaches baptism by imers and salvation in Christ and Christ alone but teaches all things even the precepts\n\n(1:18:03) of Christ and as Christ set an example in all things so they have to set an example of in all things if Christ said I've set you an example in foot washing then you must do it then that denomination must do foot washing if Christ said baptism by immersion then that denomination must do baptism by immersion if Christ said if you love me\n\n(1:18:29) keep my Commandments then that denomination must keep the Commandments is that right or wrong every single thing must be in harmony with the word and if it's not then it's problematic The Three Angels messages there's only one denomination in the world that preaches the Three Angels messages there is no other you\n\n(1:18:53) can search through this Earth from north to south east to west there's only one denomination one Christian denomination that teaches the Three Angels messages and other sheep I have which are not of this fault them also must I bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one Shepherd\n\n(1:19:15) John 10:16 God is going to bring the whole world to a decision very soon this whole world will have to make a a decision nowhere in all these lectures have I ever said that if you are not a member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church you're lost in fact I've said God's people are in church all churches but God is going to call\n\n(1:19:44) everyone to Reckoning and he's going to say choose mark of the beast or the mark of God one of the two be sealed with a seal from the world or be sealed with a seal of God and we did a big study on what that entails the Seal of God the Sabbath is a symbol of obedience to the lawgiver in all aspects and the\n\n(1:20:15) Sheep will have to listen either one way or the other neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so preaching the word is part of the Gospel of Salvation that they all may be one as thy father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou\n\n(1:20:42) has sent me John 17221 he says I do not pray for the world I pray for those that are willing here to obey now I know that we've been through a lot together and as it was in the days of old so will it be in our day but I'm not discouraged you know we've seen numbers Decline and Decline and Decline and that's normal\n\n(1:21:17) when you preach the fullness of obedience in Christ and accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior that's not as po as popular as preaching something which is less Troublesome and so one has this idea that this is a heart teaching this is a hard teaching do I really have to change my life do I really have to die does the\n\n(1:21:46) old man of sin really have to be buried can I just keep a little of him can I just be a little bit in transgression do I really have to come into harmony with all the precepts of the decalog can I not just continue keeping Sunday for example is it not possible this is a hard teaching you know it requires a lot\n\n(1:22:09) yes it does it requires a lot John 660 many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it nothing old nothing new there John 6:66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him we've seen exactly the same thing happening here\n\n(1:22:35) exactly the same thing John 6 verse 67 then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away and what did they answer then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the words of eternal life if there is only one truth and that truth is the the way and the truth and the life and it leads\n\n(1:23:07) to Christ and Christ leads us to obedience then there's no other way so when we are faced with a decision am I going to do this am I not going to do this if I want to have life and I know what's right and I do it not then it become for me what says the Bible sin so I have to make a decision some will\n\n(1:23:30) say there are many things I do not understand yet there's too much that I don't understand I cannot make a decision I don't understand many things how long would you be able to put it off this way probably forever I don't understand everything I certainly don't and I presume that I will be learning for the\n\n(1:23:50) rest of my existence even throughout eternal life let's see what the Bible says on this issue Psalms 9711 light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart I believe that everybody sitting here today we've been together through this whole series we have done so much together and still you are sitting here\n\n(1:24:18) so I know that you you enjoyed this light maybe it wasn't easy but you listen Psalms 112:4 unto the upright there arises light in the darkness start understanding how it all fits together there are so many questions why this why that why is this one like that why is that one the other way how can we all\n\n(1:24:39) belong to the same thing how is one saved all these questions if you really are upright in heart God gives you the answer Psalms 119 verse 130 the entrance of thy words gives light so if it's not word-based if it's not biblical then that light is not necessarily from God Proverbs 4:18 the path of the righteous is like the first\n\n(1:25:08) glimpse of dawn shining ever brighter till the full light of day so will it get brighter and brighter and brighter as one goes on yes or no yes you can never get to the point where where you can say I stand understand it all otherwise you can put it away you know I've discovered one thing I can take a\n\n(1:25:30) novel I can take a science book I'm a I'm a professor in physiology there's a physiology book that I used for a long time I don't even have to bother to pick it up anymore I can go to my class and I can preach it off by heart just leave it there I never have to look in it again the book doesn't change it's exactly the\n\n(1:25:52) same yesterday today and tomorrow new stuff yes that you have to keep up today with but that book I don't have to bother about it but the Bible I've been studying that now for 16 years and I still am overed by what I read in the verse that I thought I knew every single day you will learn forever and ever so this this\n\n(1:26:21) reason for not following Christ in fullness is one that you will never overcome except by taking a step of Faith none of the priests and the rulers believe this is a very important question if this is truth how many lectures have we had together I forget whatever it was 30 I don't know and every single one of them\n\n(1:26:47) did it sound like the truth to you yes or no can I see some hands who says it sounded like the truth truth I can see a couple of hands now if this sounded like the truth and if this is the truth then where are all the big guns why are they not here where are all the others where are all the theologians and the priests and the\n\n(1:27:11) pastors and the this and the that why aren't they all rushing to this if this is truth well nothing's ever changed in the past they also didn't do it John 73 too the chief priest sent officers to arrest him they didn't even bother to go and listen to him himself they just sent someone go and get rid of that guy he is\n\n(1:27:34) irritating you know what's nice about the faith that I stand for he said I don't have to hide it amen I can go into a public venue I can book the biggest Hall in the world and I can stand there and I can preach it and nobody will be able to say it's not so cuz I never said a word I just put one quote after the\n\n(1:28:02) other on the screen isn't that right isn't that what we did so what would they do if they came and said don't listen to him what if Rome came to condemn me and said how dare this man say these things and they arrest me for saying these things all I will say is I never said a word they said it themselves go and\n\n(1:28:21) arrest them they they said it Go and arrest them so this faith is not something that is grabbed out of the air it's based on the biblical foundation and I can defend it anywhere I don't have to go knocking like a thief on a back door and slip you a pamphlet to coers you into this that or the other didn't force you to be here\n\n(1:28:43) you're all sitting here by your own free choice listening and checking verse for verse going back I've got a letter there of a a person there who went back to the to the to the web to see is this really so I love that this dark day question looked up that date wow there it says Dark Day New England to this day\n\n(1:29:08) unexplained they bring it to me they say yes being confirmed every single word every single word the chief priests they sent officers to go and arrest him verse 46 they came back and they said to the priest sorry they said where is he we sent you to arrest him and they said but you know no one ever spoke like this\n\n(1:29:33) man nobody ever gave them so much to think about as Jesus did verse 47 you mean he has deceived you also has any of the rulers and the Pharisees believed him well we're in much the same boat fortunately even in biblical times many of the Pharisees and the scribes did believe most of them didn't but many of\n\n(1:30:00) them did Nicodemus did even though he came in the middle of the night scared that he might be seen he believed and he was a Powerhouse after that I tell you that thousands and thousands are accepting this truth thousands there are millions across the globe that are accepting this truth and they're being added to every\n\n(1:30:23) single day thousands upon thousands upon thousands in South America every day 2 3 thousand are being added every single day now you just add that up over time millions are coming into this truth if they do surveys and they find out how many seventh day Adventists are there then you will find that on the on the surveys\n\n(1:30:51) there are more seventh day Adventists than than in the books of the church that's fascinating if a government does a survey in its country asking what denomination do you believe belong to there are more seventh day Adventists in that country than on the books of the church what does that tell you that in their hearts they've\n\n(1:31:12) accepted this truth but they haven't made their final step yet there are whole churches including the pastor whole churches that are coming over to this truth why because there's so much to it you cannot gain say it and others will say you mean he has deceived you also none of the others have believed\n\n(1:31:35) him well maybe they haven't bothered to study it some will say the price is too high I don't want to pay this price I have to give up too much what is it to give up my father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me yet not my will but as you will it's it's profound that God should choose something as\n\n(1:31:59) simple as obedience a day to make a difference between right and wrong absolutely amazing I'll wait till the spirit moves me you know I really know this is right but you know I really don't want to move yet isn't that another one that people use well Proverbs 16:25 says there's a way that seems right to a man but in the\n\n(1:32:25) end it leads to death if you know something is right then do it I'm not one of those evangelists who will stand up here and pressurize you because all these times we have spoken to your minds and hopefully to your hearts as well but I certainly would like to have your heart and your mind working together\n\n(1:32:49) this is your choice not mine I don't have to Force you you decide is this right or is this wrong maybe you really do believe that you don't know yet you're not certain that's fair enough then you say but I either want to learn more about this because I think this is right or I want nothing else to do with\n\n(1:33:13) it that's also your decision no one else's it will cause Division I know that if I accept this my husband or my wife they're going to free I might lose my boyfriend or my girlfriend my job my family is going to go nuts mind it my cousin did this across the table he says that's your half and this is my half I'll never put my foot in\n\n(1:33:47) your house again we were best friends we were always together we ate together we drank together we laughed Together We Cried together he hasn't been in my house in 16 years it's tough my family some of them actually know it's the truth but won't move it's amazing amazing and others whole families just\n\n(1:34:16) accept it I cannot understand it drives me nuts I'm so jealous whole family father mother Uncle boyfriend girl girlfriend I gave Bible studies in my home to a group of people and uh the one girl was going out with one of with my son my son brought her to the Bible study so she started listening to the Bible study next thing\n\n(1:34:39) she brought her sister they were methodists brought her sister next thing they brought the father next thing they brought the mother next thing they brought the other boyfriends and the other every single one no problem unbelievable sometimes it works like that you don't know but it can certainly cause division Matthew 10:\n\n(1:34:59) 34:37 think not I'm come to send peace on the earth I came not to send peace but a sword the word is going to be the sword and that's going to be the only weapon that we have for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her\n\n(1:35:20) mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me you know what the Bible has every base covered there's no way to move out of this one except decide he that does not take his cross\n\n(1:35:50) and follow after me is not worthy of me now that entails a cross that means it's a burden you have to pick it up and you have to follow Christ that doesn't mean we are wretched miserable individuals but it does take a cross it is a burden and you know what the greatest burden is your greatest burden\n\n(1:36:16) does not become yourself anymore your greatest burden is how many of you felt this ah how am I going to convince my mother father husband wife boyfriend girlfriend how many of you felt this can I see some hands I can see some hands this is the burden the burden is just like Christ had a burden for Souls my wife sat down\n\n(1:36:46) and cried when she heard these messages for the first time not for herself but for her parents her father she loved her father he was such a nice man he's dead now so kind so generous he was such fun to have around and he was a new Ager probably a high Mason an occultist and he worshiped the devil wow\n\n(1:37:15) that's pretty scary I don't know what happened to him in the end we took care of him until he died or my wife did and uh he never ever said one negative word towards the end anymore and what went on in his mind is between God and him I wish I hope I believe I will see him at the resurrection but everyone has a cross\n\n(1:37:42) and we have to follow him but now thus says the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called the by thy name Thou Art mine Isaiah 43:1 do you think God will leave you alone with that cross no to carry it alone no there it says I've created you and\n\n(1:38:11) I've formed you and there's nothing to be afraid of he is the one who says fear not those are the issues that's what we've discussed all this time oh there's much more we haven't even started yet have we had a Daniel seminar no we've touched here and there on Daniel have we had a revelation seminar no we've touched here\n\n(1:38:38) and there on Revel why do I talk about those two books because they particularly concern our time the end of time we haven't touched Isaiah which is the whole Bible in one prophetic word my favorite book Isaiah wow such comfort in that book we haven't read the Psalms together to discern what all the Psalms some of them are\n\n(1:39:00) eschatological some are Messianic some are just Comfort some are what it means to be repenting we haven't read the Torah together we've done nothing we've gained through the precepts and the principles there's so much more to learn and we're going to continue with this even though I'm going to leave and I'm\n\n(1:39:19) going to be gone it's not me that you're interested in you interested in Jesus Christ he's all that matters and when you come into a body that's who you serve you serve Jesus Christ you don't look around and say now why is this one like that why was this one not doing what is's right not your business whether he's doing right or\n\n(1:39:38) whether he's not doing right your business is to follow Christ and to follow his precepts and we must come into harmony that means I can go to my brother and say listen brother why are you still doing this when the Bible actually says this and that and the other in love you can do that there's nothing wrong with\n\n(1:39:56) that don't expect Perfection but expect truth and don't give up until you found all of it that's what it's all about and follow Christ and he he will help you fear not he has redeemed you so that is the issue not that we finished but we've come to a point where we can make a decision so I would like to invite\n\n(1:40:21) anyone who has deci ided or has come to the conclusion that this is truth to stay behind afterward so that we can discuss how do we continue where do we go from here how do I fulfill the right of baptism or I have been baptized already or I'm not ready yet what do I do where do I get nurtured further what\n\n(1:40:46) do I do can't just run away from the body of Christ they were added daily so I would like to invite everyone that was convicted that we've heard truth up until now to stay behind when we end now and let's talk briefly just briefly together as to what are we going to do on the way forward some of you might\n\n(1:41:11) feel you're ready for baptism some might feel I want to join the body some might feel otherwise let's do that after this meeting no pressure nothing like that just your decision let us pray heavenly father thank you Lord for truth thank you for a word that is truth from the first page to the last and thank you for\n\n(1:41:39) the example that you have set us in Jesus Christ help us to keep our eyes fixed upon you and to follow you in all obedience Lord please come into our hearts and into our minds and help us to make right decisions so that we will follow you wheresoever you lead and not where man intends to lead any one of us thank you\n\n(1:42:08) for all the people that are here tonight and thank you Lord that you are speaking to every single one of us Lord there are many that have known this Truth for yours myself included and I would also tonight together with them like to recommit my life to you and say Lord I might have slipped along the\n\n(1:42:30) pathway I might have made mistakes but I know Lord that by your grace the righteous man falls many times but you raise him up again so those who want to recommit their lives to you may they also make a decision tonight in jesus' name amen [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music]\n\n(1:45:01) [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]",
  "# Title:Mark Of cain\n\n## Key Topics:\nMark of Cain,Herodian Mindset,Fulfillment of Prophecy,Jesuit Influence,Roman Authority\n\n## Guide:\nThis lengthy presentation argues that a \"Herodian mindset,\" rooted in the biblical story of Cain and his \"Mark of Authority,\" has manifested throughout history in various ruling powers. This mindset, characterized by enmity toward God and His people, coupled with the power to enforce its will, traces a lineage from Cain's son Enoch, through figures like Nimrod, ancient empires, and even to Herod the Great, ultimately culminating in what the speaker identifies as modern-day Freemasonry and the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the Jesuit order. The presentation emphasizes that these entities, despite outwardly appearing benevolent, secretly strive for world domination and a \"one-world religion\" based on Satanism, actively working to suppress God's true followers and His law, particularly the Sabbath. The speaker calls for awareness and a return to Protestant teachings, asserting that current global events signify the imminent fulfillment of prophecy and a final conflict between good and evil, urging listeners to choose a side.\n\n## Content:\nThe Mark of Cain and The Origin of Freemasonry Walter Veith - YouTube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XyGJICAv1g\n\n\n\n(00:00) you [Music] [Applause] [Music] good afternoon everyone you're probably wondering what does it mean when I speak about the Herodian mind now and we're living in very very strange times and the times we are living in not only affect us but affect the entire world and before they killed Tyndall he had one last prayer and he said Lord open\n\n(00:55) the eyes of the king of England and so before I start this lecture not that I want to be in Tyndall's character in shoes but before I start this lecture I also would like to pray and ask the Lord for a special favour so if you will allow me Heavenly Father throughout the ages you have wanted the eyes of those that do not see to be\n\n(01:25) opened and today I want to pray that you will open the eyes of your church and that you will not only open the eyes of your church but that you will open the eyes of the whole world so that the gathering may commence this is my prayer in Jesus name Amen now that might seem like a somewhat strange preamble to some\n\n(01:52) but in today's world and in today's climate of cooperation and ecumenism it is not politically correct to speak about the issues pertaining to the three angels messages and this is causing quite some consternation there are even some who believe that prophecy being conditional the issues regarding the\n\n(02:20) Antichrist and what the reformers believed regarding the papal system that that doesn't apply because it could be a conditional prophecy and it might never happen perhaps it only has an eschatological future but not for the here and now so today we can be in a commanding all sessions of whatever guest saw as observers but it doesn't\n\n(02:51) really pertain to us they are some to say that say we should not preach on the issue of the Antichrist and the three angels messages in the way that we do because it is offensive we should have other ways of preaching this issue and some will say it's not part about 28 fundamental beliefs and if you've studied them carefully it doesn't\n\n(03:18) say so it says that the Reformers believe that the papal system was Antichrist but it doesn't mentally say we still believe it although it is there of course in the spirit of prophecy but if you say that the spirit of prophecy cannot be used in that sense well then you don't really have a leg to stand on then it opens the\n\n(03:42) floodgates and anything can come into the church and so today when you start speaking on these issues and you link history and you link current events to the prophecies they have a nice catchphrase for it and it's called conspiracy theories have you heard that yes it's called conspiracy theories and\n\n(04:09) some will warn and say that we shouldn't be associated in any way with these conspiracy theories now I don't deny the fact that there are conspiracy theories out there but I do deny the fact that a clear exegesis of the Bible linked to current events is not conspiracy but fulfillment of prophecy and so this is\n\n(04:36) quite a problem to me and when some of our leading men write that we should not look at current events and watch the news to see what is happening because then we are inclined towards these conspiracy theories and please do not support anyone that does this kind of thing or when even leaders start discussing this issue and saying that\n\n(05:06) those who propagate any such ideas should really not be tolerated then it is time to take a deeper look and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to speak about the issue first in the philosophical sense and see where it leads and then hopefully we can come to some kind of conclusion as to where we are in the stream of time and where it\n\n(05:38) fits into see if some would want to call this conspiracy that they may if some of them would rather see it as a confederacy then they may - I see it as a fulfillment of prophecy and I see it as a fulfillment of the Word of God and I can see that we are heading towards the very final events on this planet a\n\n(06:11) testimonies there is a study of history that is not to be condemned sacred history was one of the studies in the school of the prophets in the record of his dealings with the nations were traced the footsteps of Jehovah so today we ought to consider the dealings of God with the nations of the earth we are to\n\n(06:38) see in history the fulfillment of prophecy to study the workings of Providence in the great Reformatory movements and to understand the progress of events in the marshalling of the nations for the final conflict for the growth of the great controversy that's a commission and that is a commission which is in direct contradiction to the\n\n(07:02) sentiments that I have just spoken about we have an injunction if we are Watchmen on the walls of Zion to watch the events of history and to fit them into prophetic pictures or else we could just miss the bus I wouldn't like anyone to miss the bus and particularly my church I fear for my church when they\n\n(07:31) marginalize the third angels message and the second angels message let us go back in history this is the god Marduk and he had a sign which was the sign of an O he also has a sword and the has a trident - trident in fact here which are in actual fact Thunderbolts you will find this deity as you go through the various cultures in many\n\n(08:04) many forms you will find the deities throwing their thunder bolts from the seus of the Greeks all the way through the the cultures of the world now many of these legends have their origin in some reality and the origin goes back all the way to the very beginning you see the god Marduk was the son of Anu\n\n(08:36) and he had the commission he received the Commission to rule over evil so the earth and the creation and everything that was here was evil and he received authority from God to rule over the darkness and the evil and his sign is embroidered here on the hem of his coat and upon his arm he has the mark of authority to rule over the\n\n(09:14) powers of evil now if you go back into history some will claim that this is actually a reference all the way back to the beginning and the story of Cain and Abel here is the God shamash and here he has the symbol of a new this eight pointed star which was two crosses as it were the wavy line represents the female\n\n(09:45) and the straight lines represents the male principle because these deities were always in console they were male and they were female now Ishtar was the Queen of the Night as she is called in the British Museum and she also had a star and as you can it is the same symbol it is the sign of Anna and she also ruled the night and\n\n(10:14) you find her in all the different cultures when you go to Egypt it will be Isis and Horus the Sun and Osiris the father who then became reborn as the Sun so these were the deities that ruled over evil and had the authority from the Creator God to rule over the children of Idul and so they have probably got their\n\n(10:45) origin in a greater reality now when you look at the laws and the structures that they evolved to rule over people and we find some interesting facts here this is one of the earliest laws known the Code of Hammurabi it is well preserved the Babylonian law code and it dates back to 177 to BC it's one of the oldest\n\n(11:13) deciphered writings of significant length in the world is the sixth Babylonian king Hammurabi and act at the code in partial copies exist on a human-sized stone Stella in various clay tablets now the code consists of 282 laws with scaled punishments adjusting an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth as graded\n\n(11:38) depending on social status slave versus free man nearly one half of the code deals with matters of contract establishing for example the wages to be paid to an ox driver or a surgeon so these are laws of government do they remind you of laws today do we have laws governing all these things coming into\n\n(12:01) existence in the world all over big statute books of law so they dealt with many many things so they dealt with economic measures they dealt with labor questions they dealt with the penal punishments for various crimes other set the terms of the transaction establishing reliability of the Builder for a house that collapses to have laws\n\n(12:27) like that today for example or property that is damaged while left in the care of another do we have laws like that today a third of the code addresses issues concerning household and family relationships such as inheritance divorce paternity sexual behavior do we have laws like that today only one provision appears to impose obligations\n\n(12:53) on an official this provision establishes that a judge who reaches an incorrect decision is to be fined and removed from the bench permanently a handful of provisions address issues related to military service and then it is signed with the following on this on the stellar it says a new and Bell called by my call by name me Hammurabi\n\n(13:18) the exalted prince who feared Marduk the chief god of to bring about the rule in the land so they had the power to rule they had their capacity to rule from the highest authority who they said was God God gave them the power to rule now if we go to Bible Commentary we'll see that the code of hammurabi rob Hammurabi was\n\n(13:51) one of the oldest collections of laws but there were others as well that were older than that it was written in Sumerian this one and then it was discovered near Baghdad and then the code of King Palama of Asuna who ruled some 300 years before Hammurabi was found and then another law was found that of all namu and it's fascinating\n\n(14:18) that the further you go back in history the more similarity there is between God's law and the laws of the nation so as people moved away further and further from allegiance to God's law the laws became more and more and more intrusive and more complex but these people who had these laws ruled with an iron fist\n\n(14:49) over the people of the earth authorized by God as I attempt the 14 verse 13 and I has said in my heart I will ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north so let's go back to the earliest times here was a power in heaven Lucifer\n\n(15:17) and he wanted to be in charge he wanted to sit in the seat that God occupied hard Mountain that means a kingdom the parallel in the Bible so he wanted to sit upon the kingdom of God as it were and he wanted to be part of this congregation so by implication and assembly the congregation a place of meeting or a signal appointed place\n\n(15:49) assembly feast seasons solemn synagogue he wanted to rule over the people he wanted to have rulership where we know what happened to him there was a war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and they were cast out and then he came down to this earth and\n\n(16:14) there was Adam a knee and then he worked on their minds and he deceived them and he became the ruler of this planet but God had a way out and God devised the plan of salvation and in Genesis chapter 3:15 we read and I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy see and her seed it shall bruise thy head\n\n(16:49) and thou shalt bruise his heel and James for verse 4 it says ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God so we have two groups we have the world and we have God's people do God's people have a\n\n(17:19) law yes God's people have a law and it's the law as we find it in the Bible which defines character the Ten Commandments and is there a war between good and evil yes it's called enmity between thee and the woman God's people those who belong to God's church the woman so they are subject to a law they have a covenant\n\n(17:51) with God but they are not taken out of this world they are part of this world and they are living in a world that is ruled not everywhere or hardly any place by God's people is that right so the others are ruling with what authority are they ruling and how are they ruling we'll have to look into that issue but\n\n(18:19) the fact of the matter is that what the world does and how the world thinks should be opposite to what God's people do and think now many of the laws of the land are of course the same as those that God's people would keep for example thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal and all of these and as well as the law\n\n(18:45) doesn't interfere with God's law God says you must have pay the public authorities so you must be part of the system without becoming engrossed in this them now we read that this declaration I will put enmity was not only a declaration of war but it was the first gospel preached the first gospel sermon\n\n(19:12) ever preached to fallen man this promise was the star about illuminating the dark and dismal future of the race Adam gladly received the welcome assurance of deliverance and diligently instructed his children in the way of the Lord so here was a chance a way out structure children the promise was presented in close connection with the\n\n(19:37) altar of the sacrificial offering you cannot separate the two salvation always lies outside of ourselves it is in Christ the altar and the promise stands side by side and one cast clear beams of light upon the other showing that the Justice of an offended God could be appeased only by the death of his\n\n(19:59) beloved son so if you are in Christ you are linked to the sacrifice in the case of Cain and Abel we have a type of two classes that will exist in the world till the close of time and this type is worthy of close study so this is strike two we have to study history we have to study the dealings of God with the\n\n(20:30) nations we have to study the Providence's of God in current times and apply them to what God has promised would happen that's prophecy and we are to study these two arch types it's part of our job description Cain represents those who carry out the principles and works of Satan but I worshiping God in a\n\n(20:57) way of their own choosing it doesn't say they don't worship God it says they worship God in a way of their own choosing this is very important so you can have godly people or parent godly people out there but they are worshipping God in a way of their own choosing and not in a way that God said he should be worship and we need to be\n\n(21:26) very clear about this distinction like the leader whom they follow they are willing to render partial obedience but not entire submission to God the Cain class of worshipers includes by far the largest number so anywhere you go God's people will be outnumbered is that a fact and so we are outnumbered and yet we are\n\n(22:00) not taken out of the world we are in the world but shouldn't be part of the world for every false religion that has been invented has been based on the Cain principle every false religion that has ever been invented is based on the Cain religion now just help me here to the law and the testimony if they speak not\n\n(22:27) according to this word they have no light in them should it be difficult to determine which religion is based on the Cain principle and which religion is based on the God principle don't we have a guide whereby to determine this now don't get me wrong if the vast majority of mankind belongs to the worship of the Cain\n\n(23:00) principle does that mean we isolate ourselves from this group and have nothing to do with them well then I would still be part of the King principle wouldn't I because I came out of the world and so would most of you be part of the Cain principle isn't that correct so we don't want to be part of the kind\n\n(23:22) principal and God in His mercy makes a way of escape for everyone who's part of the gang principle so you never write them off but you may never ever forget whose principle you fall under okay so every false religion that has been invented has been based on the Kane principle that man can depend upon his\n\n(23:53) own merits and righteousness for salvation every false religion Genesis chapter 4 verse 8 and Cain talked with Abel his brother because his sacrifice wasn't accepted he brought the fruits of his labor and said there it is now had God instructed them on the plan of salvation absolutely the very clothes\n\n(24:21) they're wearing skins in this picture tells you that God instructed them the lamb had already pointed ahead to the coming of the Lamb of God and they must have been instructed that without the shedding of blood there will be no remission of sins pointing to the Lamb of God so here Cain and Abel are bringing their\n\n(24:41) various offerings the one according to the dictates of God the other one according to his own dictates and when it happened that he wasn't accepted Cain's when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him now there are some I'm not too averse to the idea that think well maybe Cain even\n\n(25:10) justified his act maybe they thought that one of them would be blood sacrifice maybe he slew him even thinking well if God if you want a blood sacrifice why take a lamb why not give you the real thing so it doesn't seem as though he had great repentance he had sorrow for what he had lost but not sorrow for what he had done is that\n\n(25:38) correct I'm not saying it was so it was probably a fit of rage but in some way he must have justified it and God came to him and said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground and now art thou cursed from the earth and has opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood\n\n(25:58) from thy hand and when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto her a strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be on the earth and Cain said unto the Lord my punishment is greater than I can bear is there any sorrow in there no he has a problem with the punishment he doesn't necessarily have a problem with what he\n\n(26:23) did behold thou has driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy faith shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and now an outcast what am I going to do now God in his foresight sees that the children of\n\n(26:45) disobedience are going to eventually be far more than the children of obedience isn't that right and somebody has to rule and if he puts the minority in charge of the majority eventually all the Able's that are there will be slain is that a possibility and so God has to find the solution who's going to rule\n\n(27:10) over the children of evil who's going to do it they will slay me and so God makes a covenant with Cain and the Lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth Cain vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold and the Lord set a mark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him now there's been a lot of\n\n(27:37) speculation as to what the Mark of Cain is but we only have to look at the words to get an idea as to what the Mark of Cain is the mark the word is interesting because it's the Hebrew oath if you would take it straight into the English it would be oats but of course we're not going to do that lest we get theologically slaughtered\n\n(28:00) we'll just say that the Hebrew is oath which means a signal as a flag a beacon a monument a prodigy an evidence a mock sign a token now I forgot exodus 31:13 where we're talking about the children of God it says speak that also unto the children of Israel saying verily my Sabbath you shall keep for it is a sign\n\n(28:27) and the word there is Oh same word exactly the same word between me and you throughout your generations that you may know that I am the lord that does sanctify you two signs one the Mark of Cain the other one the mark of God's people the mark of God the Sabbath tells you where you come from and the Sabbath tells you in\n\n(28:57) Deuteronomy that you are redeemed you have been bought with a price so here are God's people they have the oath of God they are keeping the commandments of God they are in the minority when Cain sent one of Adams rebellious daughters sided with him I'm speculating of course and decided that she was more affiliated\n\n(29:32) to him then to the others and went with him if he goes I go he must have gotten a wife somewhere right and so the family split up doesn't say so in the Bible but it's a logical deduction and those that fell under the rule of Cain received the Mark of Cain and those that fell under the rule of God had a simple sign of\n\n(30:00) obedience to God's commandments right from the very beginning and I think that that is a logical conclusions of the mark is not some physical stamp or sign that he had it is a mark of authority because the Sabbath is a sign of authority therefore the Mark of Cain must be a sign of authority this one acknowledging the authority of\n\n(30:32) God and this one are not acknowledging no higher authority than himself so it's to authorities the one full subject to God the other one full subject to the Mark of Cain so they will set the authority they will set the tone and vengeance shall be taken on him Sevenfold don't mess with Cain if Cain as you in a transgression against him\n\n(31:04) he'll punish you seven times he has the authority don't mess with him and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch so now the children of disobedience start growing and I'm sure there were other defectors along the\n\n(31:34) line and Cain's family grew much faster than that of the Lord's people Adam and Eve tried their best to stem the tide so this firstborn of Cain his name was you know not to be confused with the other you know because this one didn't walk with God this one started to build cities and until you know who was born a\n\n(32:03) rat in the rat began may well yell and may weigh on me to Zion and Methuselah beget Lamech and the rod sets in and Lamech took unto Him two wives so now we have apostasy increasing the name of the one was Adah and the name of the other Zillah and then it gets even worse was 23 and Lamech said unto his wives Adah\n\n(32:32) and Zillah hear my voice ye wives of Lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man here's another murderer in the line of Cain but he is an inheritor of the authority because this is going down the sons of Cain to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if Cain shall be Avenged Sevenfold truly Lamech seventy and\n\n(32:59) Sevenfold so the rules will get tougher but not only that I was interested in the seventy and Sevenfold and I looked for a translation because it's hard to determine what it is I like the Geneva Bible and as you know that is the old Bible so the spelling looks funny but if Cain shall be in the old days that was one word if Cain shall\n\n(33:32) be Avenged Sevenfold truly Lamech seventy times seven fold says the Geneva Bible I like that seventy times seven does that ring a bell it rings a bell somewhere Oh what happened at the end of the seventy times seven that you find in the Book of Daniel probation closed for the Jews as a nation not as individuals\n\n(34:06) but as a nation so if Cain was to have a Sevenfold structure then Lama would have a seventy times seven structure but it would only last until God said probation for you is closed does that make sense I'm speculating it's a conspiracy but it does does seem that these words are not just arbitrary now let's jump straight\n\n(34:42) into the esoteric world and let me just make plain again that my sources will be the very best sources for those who want to make them obscure I will quote from the highest occult sources in the world and I will quote from encyclicals directly from the Vatican so that anybody who wishes to say that these are\n\n(35:06) not authoritative had better check them out and see whether it is so morals and dogma Albert Pike you know what's fascinating is that the esoteric world doesn't deny the Bible it just twists the Bible it doesn't deny the chronology of the Bible the evolutionists deny the chronology of the Bible these are tarik world knows that the\n\n(35:34) Bible is true that's fascinating now Mars and dogma Albert Pike he says the following you know his name signified in the Hebrew initiate or initiate or so he's the initiative of the initiator the legend of the columns of granite and brass or bronze erected by him is probably symbolic oh he's the one who built the city remember that of\n\n(36:06) bronze which survived the flood is supposed to symbolize the mysteries of which masonry is the legitimate successor so irrespective of the stuff in between those two points there we can say according to the occult world Enoch is the initiate and the initiate talk and Freemasonry is the inheritor of whatever it is that was initiated is\n\n(36:37) that correct so we're saying good so masonry traces its origin back to in all high masonry from the earliest times the custodian or masonry is the legitimate successor of the Enoch principle from the earliest times the custodian and depository of the great philosophical and religious truths unlearned to the world at large\n\n(37:08) unknown to the world at large and handed down from age to age by an unbroken current of tradition do we have a religious organization that prides itself on its tradition embodied in symbols emblems and allegories so they trace themselves back from Enoch and then they say Enoch walked with God and all these marvelous things but don't\n\n(37:36) believe everything these people say check it out do a careful so which enough are they talking about are they talking about the enough that walked with God or are they talking about the ena the son of Kane well we can find out enough son of Jared descended from Abe Adam via the line of said so it's a different line and he is\n\n(38:06) called in the Bible the seventh generation from Adam and if we use the chronology from Asha that even the spirit of prophecy used then inna would have been born in the three three eight two BC that's now the Enoch that walked with God Pike's book is dated Masonic Lee and it's dated by Christian reckoning this is fascinating stuff it\n\n(38:38) has two dates one is the Masonic date and one is the Christian date and the reckoning in pikes book to enoch is given as the year five 860 a.m. and if you look that up it means unknown Mundi the year of the world so when did the world as we know it begin and when did this unbroken line of succession come\n\n(39:06) down the line of history all the way to modern Freemasonry according to Pike it all started in the year five 860 an or Mundi you're of the world but it also has the normal date in it and it says the book came was written in 1871 ad all right so if I want to find out if five 860 anno Mundi is the same as 1870 ad then when was it BC well\n\n(39:44) then you have to subtract the one from the other five at 60 minus 1871 to get the BC date from an ad date you get to the three-eighths 0-9 BC so the masonic calendar starts in 3 809 bc and that is 427 years before the Enoch that walked with God so the dates and the very high occult writings tell us that the Enoch that they\n\n(40:19) referred to is which one the inner of K so this unbroken line of authority comes all the way from Cain now let's read the secret doctrine by Blavatsky because in the ISA Tirek world everything is turned round good becomes evil and evil becomes good let's just check this out once more once that the key to Genesis is in our\n\n(40:48) hands it is the scientific symbolical Kabbalah which unveils the secret the great serpent of the Garden of Eden and the Lord God are identical and so are Jehovah and Cain what so Cain is the god of this world who gave his power to rule to his son and he dedicated the city to him and he said there now a city also\n\n(41:20) stands for a government doesn't it isn't Babylon called the city yes or no so Babylon is called a city and Enoch got the power to rule over the city and the Lord God is the same as Cain then it means that Cain gave his power to rule to his son Enoch and the Mark of Cain was transferred the power and authority\n\n(41:49) to rule was transferred from Cain to ena and then in an unbroken line all the way through to the modern world according to them that Cain who is referred to in theology as the murderer and a liar to God chav attempts the king of Israel to number the people and Satan tempts him to do the same in another place Java\n\n(42:13) turns into the fiery serpent to bite those he's displeased with and Jehovah informs the brazen serpent that heals them these short and seemingly contradictory statements in the Old Testament contradictory because the two powers are separated instead of being regarded as the two faces of one and the same thing or the secret doctrine so\n\n(42:32) good is evil evil is good the Lord God is really okay so in that sense I knew would be Cain he is also the son of Gaea the moon goddess fascinating eeeh Eve and so there's an element of truth in these old legends the Appalachians Satan in Hebrews sat on an adversary from the word shaitana to be adverse belongs by\n\n(43:02) right to the first and cruelest adversary of all the other gods jehovah this is the secret doctrine not to the serpent who spoke only words of sympathy and wisdom and is the worst even in the dogma of the adversary of men so the enemies who the enemies God so in the line of Cain the true God is the enemy\n\n(43:28) in the line of Cain the true God is the enemy and if there is a godly person like Abel if it is within his power what will he do to him he'll kill him he'll kill him that's his mindset he wants to rule he has the power to rule he has an authority to rule he can punish Sevenfold seventy times seven fault he\n\n(43:54) can put you into jail and into misery for whatever and keep you there and tell you rights he has the power to do it and he hates the God of heaven that's his mindset now deception of course is something that comes into play as well because many who are subject to the rule of the cane stream don't even know that\n\n(44:24) they are part of the cane stream and so they are deceived into following this rule whether they like it or not therefore jehovah was called by the Gnostics the creator of and one with a few mortals the serpent of Satan so you have a reversal a gospel reversal Genesis chapter 6 verse 1 now evil starts increasing on this planet Cain\n\n(44:53) rules with ruthlessness through his line and by the time you get to LA me it is chaos and oppressive power you mess with me and my authority I will sort you out and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and the daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw that the daughters\n\n(45:19) of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose so as I've said before God's beautiful children go to do shopping in the mall and there they see the daughters of men with their short little skirts and their tantalizing little ways and before you know it they intermarry and the Lord\n\n(45:51) says he will not strive with them forever your time shall be one hundred and twenty years and they were giants nepheline apostates not angelic people that's wishful thinking on their part no there were apostates Nephilim on the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God the line of the\n\n(46:19) children of Adam through the line of Seth came unto the daughters of men and bear children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of now so you had men who received great honor in the media when you looked at the television set the antediluvian set you saw all the men of great valor and\n\n(46:45) all the rulers and they were the great philanthropists of the world the powerful rulers the presidents the ones who were making the speeches and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the Lord\n\n(47:05) that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and so in the seventy times seven was full he said probation for the antediluvian world is over and he destroys them except one family of course Noah's family was all perfect right no I think there might have been some daughters there that were\n\n(47:35) married to them who knows whether there were daughters of men or daughters of God and perhaps the line of Cain came along with the ship and the theology of Cain was in the ship God is gracious isn't he God is gracious do we have a parallel anywhere else Sodom and Gomorrah were they all perfect that was\n\n(48:00) saved there or do we have Moabites and MMA ammonites as a consequence so the post-flood apostasy and the rule of Cain resumed then through the lineage of ham so the line wasn't actually broken the apostasy the great oppression the great evil was arrested for a while but it didn't take long before it flourished on\n\n(48:28) the planet again and finally we come to the descendants of ham and we come to Nimrod and Flavius Josephus writes of Cephas writes of Nimrod now it was Nimrod who excited them to set a friend and contempt of God he was the grandson of one of NOAA's most wicked son ham therefore great-grandson of Noah\n\n(48:52) a bold man of great strength of hand he persuaded his people not to ascribe their joys to God as if it were through his means they were happy but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness do we have that same philosophy today he also gradually changed the government into a tyranny he\n\n(49:18) had the same mindset he had the same mindset seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God but to bring them in constant dependence on his power he also said he would be revenged on God if he should have a mind to drown the world again and for that he would pull the tower too high for the waters to reach\n\n(49:36) and that he would avenge himself on God for destroying their forefathers enmity towards God enmity - it's anyone who opposes him in this issue and he begins to rule he is the legitimate heir then of the power to rule over the children of evil well masonry actually in its writing says that the Tower of Babel was their\n\n(50:05) enterprise so if morals and dogma traces it back to Enoch then other writers trace it back to Nimrod but it's the same thing the one just takes the post-flood reoccurrence and the other one takes it from the pre-flood and so the Tower of Babel is depicted as a Masonic Enterprise Arthur it would wait as\n\n(50:31) regards masonry Babel of course represented them a sonic Enterprise it is well known that the Tower of Babel is one of the most ancient traditions of masonry so they don't make any bones about it and the masonic quiz book the question is asked who was number odd the answer was he was the son of cush and\n\n(50:47) the old constitution referred to as one of the founders of masonry and in the scripture as the architect of many cities was in a her architect of cities so here you have city dwellers and country mouse all right we filed at the making of the Tower of Babel there was masonry first much esteemed of and\n\n(51:12) Nimrod was a Mason himself and loved well Mason's these are Masonic sources now as we go down through history we come to the various ruling powers the super powers of Earth that held sway and we will find some parallels in all of them they all received the same power to rule over the children of disobedience\n\n(51:39) those who chose their own way to worship God if we go down in time to the history to the history of the Egyptians taught Moses the third he's the one who said who is the Lord that I should obey his voice he was the Napoleon of Egypt he was the great lawmaker nobody stood in his way or he would destroy them and he\n\n(52:05) made 90 Sabbath laws you will remember when he said you will not rest you will not Shabbat you will not keep the Sabbath you will not rest but you will get unto your burdens and when he made laws which counted God's law his authority was judged at an end by God so who permitted him to rule until he overstepped the mark God God permitted\n\n(52:35) him to rule did God permit the king of Egypt to even be the authority in terms of government procedures of his own children yes or no yes where they subject to the rules of Egypt yes did he have the power to even enslave them yes or no yes did he had the power to oppress them the Bible says they were\n\n(53:07) solely oppressed but there was a limit seventy times seven when your probation clothes closes you will be eradicated so let's go away from Egypt and let's go to the Assyrians this is history grisly Assyrian record of torture and death a Syrian national history as it has been preserved for us in the inscriptions and pictures\n\n(53:37) consists almost solely of military campaigns and battles when you look at the news today do you see military campaigns and battles yes or no so it seems as if the this line of power that rules over the children of disobedience has military might and military power and exercises that power even over the\n\n(54:02) children of God is that right a theory emerged as a territorial state in the 14th century BC its territory covered approximately the northern part of modern Iraq the first capital of Assyria was 'soul located about 150 miles north of the modern Baghdad and there on the left is a relief of a Syrian torturer they would rip the skins\n\n(54:28) of people off their bodies while they were alive the Bible tells us that they took Manasseh with hawks through his nose and dragged him to Babylon he must have had one painful nose on the west coast of the Tigris River the city was named for its national God a soul from which the name Assyria is also derived\n\n(54:55) from the outside this area projected itself as a strong military power bent on conquest countries and people that oppose such Syrian rule were punished by the destruction of their cities and the devastation of their fields and orchards in the 9th century Assyria had consolidated hit hit Emir over the\n\n(55:16) northern Mesopotamia it was then that the Assyrian armies marched beyond their own borders to expand their empires seeking booty financed their plans for storm or conquest and power by the mid 19th century the Syrian Menace posed the direct threat to the small sir of Cairo Palestine states to the West including\n\n(55:37) Israel and Judah so do they eventually try to take over God's people as well yes and they have the line of authority because there are children of disobedience and these are reliefs where we find the Assyrian armies here are the heads of the decapitated people that they decapitate it here they are the\n\n(56:04) people are strung up on poles with Spears all the way through them the cruelest tortures that you can imagine and people were scared of these rulers if Cain shall be Avenged 7 times Lamech seventy times seven times if you don't fall subject to us we'll show you what power we have and we have authority we\n\n(56:32) have it directly by permission of God it's got to Roman law by this time the governments of the world have consolidated a legal system which is second to none there's a law for every single transgression you can think of there are penalties for moral deeds which are just indescribable and permissions for immorality which are\n\n(57:03) equally indescribable does it bring about and how did they deal with the centers in the Roman Empire well you were thrown to the Lions in the Coliseum you were crucified on a cross you were eaten alive by animals you were whipped with whips until your entrails hung out the cruelty was just in discs and their aggression did their\n\n(57:39) aggression turn against God's people yes or no yes it did but they ruled and they had power to rule now let's have a look at one man who lived at that time and his name was Herod the Great he has been described as a madman who murdered his own family and a great many rabbis if he murdered a great many rabbis then did he\n\n(58:06) have power to do so even over God's people yes or no master that the evil genius of the Judean nation prepared to commit any crime in order to gratify his unbounded Abyss ambition any crime and the greatest bull day in Jewish history is known for his colossal building projects there's this ring a bell you\n\n(58:30) know does this ring a bell Nimrod the great builders so they love their cities they love their great monumental buildings he's now info colossal building projects out Judea including his expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem now excuse me this man is a cruel cruel ruler who has power to rule God's people are even\n\n(59:01) subject to him and he's building a temple for the worship of Yahweh the construction of the port at Samaria and Masada and rhodium and all of these and he was a powerful man the Aronian dynasty was a Judean dynasty of Edomite itta men descent a Rodian dynasty began with Herod the Great to assume the\n\n(59:35) throne of Judea so he ruled over God's people with Roman support and bringing down the century-long Hasmonean Kingdom his kingdom lasted until his death in four pce when it was divided between his sons as Tetrarchy which lasted about ten years most of those kingdoms including Judea were incorporated into the provinces etc\n\n(1:00:00) etc these Judaizers were not considered jewish by the dominant pharaoh sake of tradition so even though Herod may have considered himself of the Jewish faith he was not considered Jewish by the observant and national Jews of Judea could we say today that there are some people who consider themselves of the Christian faith for\n\n(1:00:26) those who believe in the law of God and the Torah do not really consider them of the same level of knowledge in terms of Christianity yes or no they're possible now Aaron was a loyal supporter of Haqqanis to Auntie Potter appointed Herod governor of Galilee at twenty-five in his elder brother governor of\n\n(1:00:48) Jerusalem and he enjoyed the backing of Rome but his brutality was condemned by the son Hedren he was brutal he was a ruthless room man two years later an taganas nephew took the throne from his uncle with the help of the Parthian san Herod fled to Rome and they did some pleading with his Roman rulers to\n\n(1:01:15) restore him to power and there he was elected by the Roman Senate King of the Jews now here was a king of the Jews and Josephus and the encyclopedias or the sources and Romans 913 says as it is written Jacob I loved but Esau I have hated now does God hate people of course not so what did God hate he hated the\n\n(1:01:46) mindset of you know he hated the mindset of you know and here was a man who claimed to be ruler over God's people but he had the mindset of you know and God that mindset did God permit him to rule yes he permitted him to rule his first leadership role was as governor of Galilee a position granted to him by his\n\n(1:02:15) father and dupatta early on Herod demonstrate his brutality by ruthlessly crushing a revolt in Galilee later during the Parthian incursion he flees makes his way to Rome where impresses Marc Anthony and with his help persuades the Roman senators to name him King of the Jews say can return and bring Judea back\n\n(1:02:35) under Roman control and after three years of fighting he takes the throne and he is officially King of the Jews can you see why is upset when suddenly there's a rumor there's another King of the Jews Matthew to verse 18 in Ramah there was a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning Rachel\n\n(1:03:00) weeping for her children and would not be comforted for they are not so he murders the little children in order to get rid of Christ but he underestimates God does he persecute God's people yes does he hate this kind of opposition godly opposition absolutely whose mindset does he have he has the mindset of Cain he has the mindset of\n\n(1:03:32) Cain he has the same power to rule who does he get his power from who Glens him that power gives him his title roh-roh gave him his power gave him his title you're the king of the Jews and so he built the temple I'm the king of the Jews I'll build a temple and he builds a temple but here it's all fit however to\n\n(1:03:59) place at the main entrance a huge Roman Eagle who does he dedicate the temple to not to the God of the universe he dedicates the temple which stands for worship he did - wrong this is history and the pious Jews saw this as sacrilege as well they should here it was in symbols take it in antitype can we see God's worship\n\n(1:04:34) dedicated to Rome today yes or no wouldn't the pious Christians see that as sacrilege yes or no okay two teachers and a group of tourists students smashed this emblem of idolatry and oppression but Herod had them hunted down and dragged in Chains to his residence in Jericho where they were burned alive do\n\n(1:05:02) you see his mindset do you know of Christians that were later burned alive because they had a different mindset - ROH thus having built the temple Herod took pains to make sure it would be run without future problems of this kind you will worship your God according to my dictates he pointed his own high priests\n\n(1:05:30) having by then put to death 46 leading members of the Sanhedrin the rabbinical court so by the time Jesus actually starts preaching the good guys old dead already have been put to sleep Herod's cruelty was legendary I'm talking about the Herodian mind but it's not isolated to Herod it is a historic mindset that\n\n(1:06:01) comes all the way from the Garden of Eden and runs with an unbroken chain all the way through history and to our present day and we have to find the current custodians of this here Odeon mindset now I chose Herod I could have said the mind of Cain but I find the inherent the culmination of history because it is Herod or his\n\n(1:06:32) son who was also a Herod who even crucified the Prince of Peace so this mind said this enmity towards God's people coupled with the power to exercise it under official Authority is mind-boggling because initially God granted Cain the Mark of Cain the authority to rule and he established an enormous secret police force I want you\n\n(1:07:08) to look at history and let the bells start ringing brutally killed anyone suspected of plotting against him and created Roman peace by slaughtering all dissidents we will have military intervention if you don't do as we say Herod Antipas the mindset continues remember the story of Herod Herod yes and salamÃ©\n\n(1:07:45) I don't want to go into that typology I've done it before but the head of john the baptist's give it to me now fortunately in our typology this was a type of the elijah but there was also an elijah that was translated without seeing death so we will see some of us might end up being John the Baptist's\n\n(1:08:11) typologically and some of us might end up hopefully being the other one the one who did not see death and this is Jesus before Herod Antipas can you imagine the king and the Prince of the universe being arrayed before this earthly monarch who is sitting there by whose authority God's Authority he has been permitted to\n\n(1:08:47) rule because God in His mercy doesn't want anyone to be lost now when to ask your question did God give Herod Antipas every single possible opportunity to repent yes or no what does that tell you about the character of God it's unbelievable unbelievable and I want you to cast your mind back in history the Babylonian Empire when\n\n(1:09:26) Nebuchadnezzar set up a system which was just the same as Herod's Nebuchadnezzar had a secret police second to none he knew everything that was happening in his kingdom he was unbelievably cruel if you crossed him you ended up in the fiery furnace alive throw you in there I don't care if my soldiers die in the\n\n(1:09:48) process there was a cruel man he set up a counterfeit system of religion did God give him every opportunity to repent yes or no will he be in heaven yes there are Syrians if you go down in history you come to neni way was there a ruler who repented at the preaching of Jonah one of the cruelest of all rulers thing his name was not\n\n(1:10:21) married three and all of a sudden all history of his cruelty ceases and there is no more war and total peace in his kingdom does God care about these rulers yes and here he is arrayed before him he gets a final opportunity he sees the Prince of Peace he sees those eyes he sees them personally and he has him\n\n(1:10:48) mocked and they put a reed in his hand and they put a crown of thorns on his head and they beat him over the head over and over and over again and say prophesy who beat you over the head this is the mind of hero it is a mind that has separated itself from God but it has power to rule and the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends\n\n(1:11:14) together poor before they were at enmity between themselves if there is one thing that unites even the warring factions of the children of Cain it's a common enemy and if that gun a common enemy is still the Prince of peace always followers so much the better because Cain slew Abel and that animosity towards the truth is\n\n(1:11:46) part and parcel of those who have the Mark of Cain all the way through revelation 12:3 and they appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great dragon having seven heads and ten horns and ten Crown's upon his heads and his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and it costs them to the earth\n\n(1:12:05) and the dragon stood before the woman which woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born Herod the first and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and a child was caught up unto God and to his throne he is the true ruler his law is a law of\n\n(1:12:27) justice and mercy the other ruler also rules with a rod of iron but he rules with a Mark of Cain and the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord against his Christ acts 426 for the truth against thy Holy Child Jesus whom thou hast anointed both Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and the\n\n(1:12:53) people of Israel were gathered together that's scary that's scary my question is the following can this Mark of Cain E progress to within God's people itself men and brethren children of the stock of Abram and whosoever among you fear of God to you is the word of the salvation sent for they that dwell at Jerusalem\n\n(1:13:25) and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him so what is the criterion of these rulers they knew it not and they didn't know the prophecies either they didn't know him and they didn't know the prophecies\n\n(1:13:47) should God's people know him and the prophecies yes or no okay now about that time Herod the King stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church he wasn't satisfied with killing the Prince of Peace and handing over handing him over beaten to Pilate no no he stretched his hand out towards the church because\n\n(1:14:11) the mindset of Cain is slay Abel and when Peter was come to himself he said now I know for a surety that the Lord has sent his angel because he imprisoned even Peter I jumped a few verses there and delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews will there be\n\n(1:14:34) persecution yes or no who is our only deliverer and our only hope in that persecution Jesus and I want you to remember that because we're going to go into very fine detail here and we prayed that the eyes of this church and of the world will be open and upon a said day Herod arrayed in royal apparel set upon his throne and made an\n\n(1:15:03) oration unto them and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god not of a man who do we hear things like that someone today just from that little balcony opens his mouth and says cheap they say well it's a voice of a god and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not glory to\n\n(1:15:26) the Lord and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost there comes a time when the seventy times seven is up and probation stops for the rulers who rule under the power of the mark of authority given by God to Cain to rule over the children of evil I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers\n\n(1:15:51) intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority do you understand that verse a little bit better we must pray that God will curtail them in their animosity towards God's people so that the work of God can continue that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all\n\n(1:16:18) godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior God has handed over the children of evil to the rules of evil you know my wife gave classes she was a schoolteacher in a very very very depressed unruly very disenfranchised school and the children were incredibly unruly and violent they had strangled a\n\n(1:16:57) teacher that had stabbed another teacher the police were afraid to break up the gang fights in the school and she taught in that school now my wife is a timid lady and her Authority counted for nought and so one day she said to them all right you don't want to listen to my rules and you make the rules and I said\n\n(1:17:27) ok and I started making the rules if you do this then that happens to you if you do this and I met along list of rules the most draconian rules that you can imagine like if you chew gum or something you will sweep the whole school with a toothbrush on your knees until the skin comes off rules like that and they stuck to their rules\n\n(1:17:54) and there was harmony in the class so when she couldn't rule over them she handed them over to the Mark of Cain and said rule over the children of evil and they said we will increase the rules 712 nay seventy times seventy is that I thought there is a good example and that's exactly what God did he said okay\n\n(1:18:18) you don't want to accept my authority I'll hand you over to that authority and behind that authority stands another authorities called the dragon and he's blowing his evil breath upon them put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work to speak evil of no man to be no\n\n(1:18:43) brawlers but gentle showing or meekness unto all men for rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil will tell their not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same and it works like that if you do good people despise you but eventually they sort of respect you\n\n(1:19:02) especially when you're dead isn't this a yes go and look at the monuments of all the great men that were hated and respected after their death so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me so we are not in a perfect situation God has given them the power to rule we\n\n(1:19:23) are subject to that rule just like the children of Israel were subject to Pharaoh there's nothing we can do about it but we can pray we can pray for them and we can obey the rules of the land as far as they do not come into conflict with God's law and then we must rely on God that's the situation we are in now\n\n(1:19:43) this is some see a dot a 23 8:11 BC so here you have one of these great Syrian rulers and notice what he has around his neck and he is one of those powerful rulers and there is the symbol of a new also the star of Ishtar so there's a male deity and there's a female deity and he has authority who's Authority does he have and under whose\n\n(1:20:13) Mach does he rule under the Mark of Cain now we studied the these are Taric writings and we saw with that led to so let's go back to them this is again morals and dogma the degree rose and then he uses the symbol is that the same symbol that you saw on the Assyrian King yes teaches three things the unity\n\n(1:20:39) immutability and goodness of God so there's an element of religion here the immortality of the soul is that the true God or false God it's a false God and the ultimate defeat an extinction of evil and wrong and sorrow by a Redeemer or Messiah yet to come if he has not already appeared excuse me is this the same Messiah we're waiting\n\n(1:21:06) for no so here is a religion but it's not the religion of God it's another religion and it's a false religion but this degree the rose uses this as its sign and here are the symbols of the Rosicrucians they use the phoenix rising out of the ashes and they use the symbol of the pelican feeding its young now\n\n(1:21:34) without the shedding of blood there is no redemption and the lamb had to die in order to symbolize the death and the resurrection of Jesus here is a sacrifice which is made to feed the children but the creature does not die so it's a false religion it's a false religion and this was the symbol that was used that the last Olympics in\n\n(1:21:57) London where the furnace arises out of the ashes so the rulers the world used the symbol that is used in the Rosicrucian symbolism so the current rulers of the world haven't suddenly changed they haven't suddenly become God's people if you go to Roman Catholicism you'll find both of these emblems in the\n\n(1:22:22) Roman Catholic Church and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and what great Authority who according to the scripture wields the authority today the beasts the beasts now every\n\n(1:22:48) reformer said that this was Roman Catholicism there's no doubt about it that this was Roman Catholicism Thomas Woodrow Wilson since I entered politics I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately some of the biggest men in the United States in the field of Commerce and manufacture are afraid of\n\n(1:23:09) somebody are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it there was the President of the United States who handed over the financial power of the\n\n(1:23:33) United States to the Federal Reserve fascinating Liberty has never come from the government this is the president of the United States speaking Liberty has always come from the subjects of the government the history of Liberty is a history of resistance the history of Liberty is a history of the limitation\n\n(1:23:56) of governmental power not the increase of it so when governmental power increases they are exercising an authority and it's an authority that comes all the way down from the line of Enoch the Rosicrucians who use the very symbol there it is that we found on their Syrian kings and they are subject to the\n\n(1:24:23) Roman sea and today we have two popes ruling although one sits on the throne and both of them have these powers under their control and here is the current general of the Jesuits Adolfo nicolÃ¡s and he rules over forces that we will see are all encompassing now let's go to the great controversy I specifically\n\n(1:24:55) chose the great controversy because isn't this a project of this church just checking throughout Christendom Protestantism was menaced by formidable foes Protestantism was menaced the first triumphs of the Reformation past Rome summoned new forces hoping to accomplish its destruction at this time the order\n\n(1:25:21) of the Jesuits was created now please note I'm not saying this the most cruel unscrupulous and powerful of all the champions of popery the most cruel cut off from every earthly tie and human interest dead to the claims of natural affection reason and conscience only silence then you no rule no tie but that of their order and\n\n(1:25:44) no duty was to extend its power the gospel of Christ had enabled its adherents to meet a danger and during suffering undismayed by cold hunger and toil poverty to uphold the banner of truth in the face of the wreck the dungeon and the stake to combat these forces Jesuit ISM inspired its followers with a fanaticism that enabled them to\n\n(1:26:06) endure lack dangers and to oppose to the power of truth all the weapons of deception there was no crime too great for them to commit no deception to base for them to practice no disguise too difficult for them to assume vowed to perpetual poverty and humility it was the studied aim to secur wealth and power to be devoted to\n\n(1:26:31) the overthrow of Protestantism and the reestablishment of the papal supremacy that's from the pen of inspiration the Inquisition was unscrupulous it was cruel now the Jesuits were given the Inquisition in Rome not to be confused with the Spanish Inquisition which was run by the Dominicans but in Rome the\n\n(1:27:00) Jesuits at the heart of power they were the inquisitors the tools they used for torture were renders this thing was put around your neck and that screw tightened until your larynx gave way and you died and it was used as recently as in the Franco wars in Spain they used the thumbscrews they tied people to a\n\n(1:27:24) host and tied a heavy ball and then dropped it down so that their limbs would be ripped from their bodies they burned people at the stake the most incredible tortures these are drawings and pictures of actual events that took place this is how they tied them up and then they dropped that ball they were so\n\n(1:27:45) cruel it is unbelievable and the spirit of prophecy says these were the champions and here you have the present black Pope and the present white Pope and today we have some unprecedented history we have two current popes and we have for the first time in history two black popes because not only Ratzinger retired but Peter\n\n(1:28:16) Hans Calvin Bach also retired for the first time in history is the work so great that they have to divide the world into two parts and they are at the disposal of this mighty machine here is the present Pope in the company of the Jesuits because the first thing when a pope is elected is he meets with the\n\n(1:28:40) jesuit and his highest authorities Adolfo nicolÃ¡s the black Pope and bergoglio the white Pope they seem very happy about something very happy both of the magis Christian example of Pope Francis provides a contrast with the graceless but who would ever have believed his successor could be a Francis from the\n\n(1:29:08) ends of the earth a Jesuit nor so ran in the 2005 Conclave the poorest of the poor know the great surprise about Francis isn't that he's so Christian he walks the walk so many prelates he content to just talk the talk he showed the trappings of his office to live frugally in Borna Cyrus he took the bus\n\n(1:29:32) but to go and visit the Pope just next door talk the helicopter and he was elected on the 13th of the 3rd 2013 at the numbers it comes to 13 and the smoke appeared at five past 8:00 at the numbers it comes to 13 and yesterday he went to Assisi and his departure time is exact and his return time is exact\n\n(1:30:07) you'll spend exactly 13 hours in Assisi and his name is Francis is it Francis of Assisi oh is it Francis Xavier the co-founder of the Jesuit Order who ordered the Inquisition in Goa and proclaimed that all Sabbath keepers there should be destroyed I am fascinated with this man here he is seen kissing the feet of prisoners if you\n\n(1:30:39) look carefully still wears his black robes under his white robe as you can see over there there is his symbol in the bus that I want to discuss that picture further and let's read the great controversy when a peirong as members of the order they were ago wore a garb of sanctity visiting prisons and hospitals\n\n(1:31:04) ministering to the sick and to the poor I'm reading from the great controversy professing to ever announce the world and bearing the sacred name of Jesus who went about doing good but under this blameless exterior the most criminal and deadly purposes were concealed it was a fundamental principle of the order that\n\n(1:31:24) the end justifies the means by this code lying theft perjury assassination were not only pardonable but commendable when they served the interests of the church and a various disguises the Jesuits worked their way into offices of state climbing up to be the councilors of Kings shaping the policy of Nations\n\n(1:31:44) they became servants to act the spies upon their masters they established colleges for the sons of princes and Nobles and schools for the common people and the children of Protestant parents were drawn into observance of purpose rites that's what the pain of inspiration tells us two swords a medieval doctrine on the relation of\n\n(1:32:07) church and state as explained by Pope Boniface the eighth we are taught by the word of the gospel that in this church and under her control there are two swords the spiritual and the temporal this is the Pope speaking both of these the spiritual and the temporal swords are under the control of the church who\n\n(1:32:30) has the mark of authority according to this the church which Church wrong the first is wielded by the church the second is wielded on behalf of the church the first is wielded by the hands of the priests the second by the hands of kings and soldiers but at the wish and by the permission of the priests\n\n(1:32:52) sword must be subordinate to sword and his only fitting that temporal Authority should be subject to the spiritual this doctrine was not defined by the Pope but reflected the mentality of the age when both priests and Kings were members of the same Catholic Church in whose name post Boniface was speaking for the John\n\n(1:33:13) Henson modern Catholic dictionary this is their writings they control the sword they wield the sword of authority they have the mark of power this is the Pope's bull unum sanctum we are informed by the text of the gospel that in this church and in its power are two swords the spiritual and the temporary for when\n\n(1:33:36) the Apostle says behold there are two swords that is to say in the church since the apostles were speaking the Lord did not reply that there were too many but sufficient we'll talk about that text in a moment certainly the one who denies that the temporal sword is in the power of Peter has not listened well\n\n(1:33:52) to the word of the Lord commanding put up thy sword unto thy scabbard both therefore in the power of the church that is to say the spiritual and the material sword but the four mains to be administered for the church but the letter by the church the former in the hand of the priest the latter in the\n\n(1:34:08) hands of kings and soldiers but at the will and sufferance of the priest who controls the church however one sort or two be subordinate to the other and temporal Authority subjected to spiritual power for since the Apostle said there is no power except from God and the things that are ordained of God\n\n(1:34:31) Romans 13:1 and two but they would not be ordained if one-third what no sword were not subordinate to the other and if the inferior were FIRREA one as it were were not laid upwards by the other furthermore we declare we proclaim we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature\n\n(1:34:51) be subject to the Roman pontiff now I didn't take this from some obscure source I made sure I took it directly from the Vatican webpage so check it out there for yourselves now let's look at this text Luke 22 35 and he this is Jesus speaking how this text has been distorted is amazing and he said to them\n\n(1:35:18) when said I sent you without person scrip and shoes Lackey anything and they said nothing okay let's just get one thing clear God's people how did he sent them out without script without purse right now I say then said he unto them but now he that has a purse how would they sent out help me without purse so\n\n(1:35:51) now I was referring to another Clause those that had the purse those that have the power over the economy those that have the power over the sword but now he that has a purse let him take it and likewise his script that's his knapsack and he that has no sword let him sell His garment and buy one this is war\n\n(1:36:18) this is wrong for I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned amongst the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end and they said Lord behold there are two sorts and he said unto them it is enough what did Jesus say to them Jesus said to my dear\n\n(1:36:43) disciple I don't think you understood what I just said I said to you I sent you out without purse but there's another class that has the purse and that has the sword and I the son of man will now be handed over to them and they will use that authority and they will crucify me but they didn't understand so they said\n\n(1:37:10) the Lord look we've got two swords and Jesus says no please I'm not talking about your stupid little sword it's enough he's talking about those who wield the authority those who have the Mark of Cain who are going to kill him it's not the church that must wield the sword it is those who rule over the\n\n(1:37:31) children of evil Thomas Aquinas said the Pope by divine right has spiritual and temporal power as supreme king of the world he is the king the Pope of Rome is the head of the papal government claims absolute sovereignty and supremacy over all the governments of the earth that is they're saying the right of deposing\n\n(1:37:52) Kings is inherent in the supreme sovereignty of the Pope's as vice regent of Christ exercises over all Christian nations this is what they claim and whose sign do we see there we see the sign of Honor the very one that mad Dooku or the one that emphasizes the power now we'll follow it a little bit but we will do that in the next episode\n\n(1:38:23) I'm sure we all need a sword break so let's take a short break and come back for the second off [Applause] [Music] as we saw in the first half the rulers who have received power to rule over the children of disobedience have a certain mindset which may be suppressed for long periods of time but when it manifests\n\n(1:38:56) itself it is the same mindset that was manifested by Herod so the huronian mind is one that is in enmity with God even though it has power over God's people the Rodian mindset will also try to make the worship of God subject to his own ideology because Herod put the Eagle of Rome on the temple of Yahweh that he\n\n(1:39:34) restored so this mindset can be followed all the way through history and when it culminates in oppressive regulations and rules which contradict God's law then God says probation is over that in brief summary of what we've said so far we saw that the mark of Honor is central to the Roman power now let's have a look at\n\n(1:40:09) another piece revelation 13:11 and I held another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him what kind of power does the first beast claim to have it says it has two swords the one is the spiritual\n\n(1:40:36) power and the other one is the temporal power and that the spiritual power is over the temporal power we saw those papal encyclicals who wields the second sword on his behalf in the world we are living in today well the Bible tells us I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a\n\n(1:41:02) lamb and he spoke like a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him on his behalf and causes the earth and then the dwelling to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed so the power the secular arm of power that he wields and uses is particularly manifested in the\n\n(1:41:27) second beast which is the United States of America and here is the Capitol and on top of the Capitol you have a female deity Paris the fullness Venus if you like she is the same as the Easter the ruler of the night the consort of Marduk who was given authority to rule over the children of evil now a copy tall can\n\n(1:42:05) only be subject to the god Jupiter because he was the Capitol and that is the god of road and so we have the similarities in architecture and the one is subject to the other but the female deity the deity of the rulership of the children of Darkness in an occult fashion contrary to the worship of God\n\n(1:42:36) but supposedly subject to him and if you come to pass says 1 Kings 1917 that him that Escapist the sword of Hazael shall ye who slay and him that escaped Earth from the sword of year who shall Elisha slay yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel all the knees have not bowed unto bail and every mouth\n\n(1:43:05) which has not kissed him so God uses the temporal power to punish even God's people when they are apostate and he has done this many times over has he not used those who claim rulership of the children of disobedience to punish God's people in the past yes or no he certainly has and history becomes just so much clearer if we\n\n(1:43:35) understand these things because people are confused how can God do this how can this happen we are living on a planet of disobedience and God by permitting this is extending the hour of grace and giving an opportunity now the sword that comes out of the mouth of Elijah is that an earthly sword oh is that a spiritual\n\n(1:44:02) sword it simply means that those who don't accept the message that comes out of the mouth of Elijah who wears the cloak of Elijah in other words the Elijah message they will die they will die and there was fall subject to the other sword which is in the hands of jail and he also served the Lord in sorts but the Bible says his heart was\n\n(1:44:34) not right and he served other gods and he followed the ways of Jeroboam but he was still used as a sword but he saves the poor from the sword from their mouth from their mouth and from the hand of the mighty now the poor here of course are those who are destroyed in spirit those who seek something better who seek\n\n(1:45:01) the Lord this is not talking about literal poverty and Jared Joab said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of Israel and as i acting of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against Jo and the portion of neighbor the jezreelite it is a very fascinating story we'll do\n\n(1:45:21) a little bit more about this in the second half now we know that I have coveted neighbor's vineyard and eventually Jezebel who serves as a type of the church and gave it to him by her authority but this is where he meets him and it came to pass when char Joanne saw Jehu that he said is a piece child and he answered what piece so long\n\n(1:45:49) as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and now which crafts are so many that counts for today - there can be no peace as long as the whoredoms of Jezebel are so many there can be no peace it is war from the beginning and I will put enmity this war hasn't stopped but I've got good news for you it's coming to a head\n\n(1:46:21) this is the black obelisk of shamaness at the third showing Jehu paying tribute so here is his obelisk and there is Jehu and he is paying tribute this was a prince of Israel this is the sword was given to him to correct the faults in Israel he slew all the descendants of Ahab and eventually he also slew Jezebel\n\n(1:46:58) typologically this is a fascinating story but there's something else that's very interesting about this here is shamaness of the third and here is his symbol of authority can you see that so this man Jehu who was ruling and was king in israel was only ruling as king subject to whom subject to Salman Issa\n\n(1:47:29) now if you take some Aneesa down the line of history you go through the babylonian kings the same authority stayed with them then the medo-persians then the Greeks then the Romans and then papal Rome they all followed the same line and anybody who rules and wields the sword must be subject to the king of\n\n(1:47:55) Babylon now there's something else that's fascinating about this you can't see the whole of it here but this a little bit more in this reconstruction they all wearing cute little hats Jay who is wearing one there it is and those carrying the tribute are also wearing some can you see that what is also\n\n(1:48:19) interesting is that these people have beards Jo has appeared and these have beards but these two servants of Psalm Aneesa and that one don't have beards what does that tell you they were eunuchs in the court of the King and because they have this little funny little hat if you take this hat through all the way through history it has a\n\n(1:48:52) connotation with the god mitra ism mitra but mid-rise just a further continuance of the sun god and in a sense later it became the Phrygian cap and it became the cap of the revolution in France where freedom was given to the citizens so the Hat the Phrygian hat is a symbol of subservience to the sun-god but it is\n\n(1:49:17) also a symbol of being a free man and as a free man you could procreate you won't castrate you could procreate and you could rule and you could be free on one condition and that was you can only free and a free man if you are subject to the ruler who has the sign and the mark of our nose then you could be free\n\n(1:49:52) then you could be free now before you go too far in our previous sermon we said you can either be slaves to righteousness or slaves to unrighteousness God's people will also bow down to a ruler because the Bible says every knee will bow that includes God's people right but the difference is this this one is by\n\n(1:50:21) compulsion and fear the other one will be out of free choice so who is really free only those who serve Jesus Christ so there's little hat this Phrygian hat over here means I am free man I'm a free man but I am subservient now if you were a part of the occult line then these symbols were all used now in Freemasonry\n\n(1:50:52) they trace their origin of their rituals that they have today to the Knights Templars and they were great builders of castles and banks and builders builders builders they don't remind us of something coming down that line and they were called for Mr song which means brother Masons but if you transliterated\n\n(1:51:21) directly into English eventually it becomes free mason and the word free gets another connotation other than a brotherly guilt it's also I am free I can be what I want to be provided I bow I bow so the god mitra wore this little hat as was worn by jay who so I don't want the little hat you can keep it but the United States Senate has\n\n(1:51:59) what they're in its emblem the little hat and the United States military has what they're in its symbol so is it the symbol of subservience to the king of babylon yes or no yes and are they free yes they are free masong they are free true they are free to exercise the power on behalf of the other one but they\n\n(1:52:32) really they are in bondage to a system if you want to read an interesting book then get rulers of evil and it comes out in two covers one has the God as it is in on the Great Dome of the Capitol building where there is marvelous symbolism and here you have this female deity wielding the sword over the\n\n(1:53:03) children of disobedience and it also has the god mercury on the dome the mercurial God the Pied Piper who leads by deceit people into hard days and who is the god of commerce and finances the revolution of the colonies against Britain all the symbolism is in there the same as you will find the symbolism\n\n(1:53:29) in Rome but this cover is rather revealing because the symbol of Honor is placed on the chest of whom there which priest what kind of priest Jesuit priest and I found this fascinating that a man who doesn't have the prophecies that we have and there's great privilege that we have can come to such conclusions was\n\n(1:54:00) mind-boggling the preface of the book was written by journalist Pat Shannon and he writes a very fascinating preface he says the only people in the world it seems who believe in conspiracy theory of history are those of us who have studied it he makes another statement later on he says you will read this book from cover to\n\n(1:54:29) cover and you will highlight it over and over and over again he said make sure that you put it on the bottom of your shelf that all your children will someday get hold of it and then he continues and says while Franklin D Roosevelt might have exaggerated when he said nothing happens in politics by accident\n\n(1:54:50) if it happens it was planned that way carroll quigley now let me tell you carroll quigley was he was the Jesuit of Georgetown University who was the lecturer of the presidents that studied there and of all the great people that rule in America amongst others both clinton carroll quigley writes bill clinton's favorite professor at\n\n(1:55:19) georgetown university boldly admitted in his tragedy and hope written in 1966 that a the multitudes were already under the control of a small but powerful group bent on world domination and be that Quigley was a Jesuit himself was part of that group so out of the mouth of the professor of Georgetown\n\n(1:55:47) University the Jesuit University he says there's a group of powerful elite that rules the world in his part of it interesting interesting well I wonder what this man learnt there let's see what he learned and a special thanks to the members of the Roosevelt family who were here and the one who is not Eleanor\n\n(1:56:13) who made sure that the Four Freedoms were included the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 I know that because as all of you famously learned when I served as president my wife now the Secretary of State was known to commune with eleanor on a regular basis and so she called me last\n\n(1:56:46) night on her way home from Peru to remind me to say that Eleanor had talked to her and reminded her that I should say that now my question is this this is a ruler his ear was he ruling according to the dictates of God yes or no judging by what you just heard no so he's a ruler over the children who would\n\n(1:57:15) worship God according to their own methodologies that correct please don't misunderstand me God loves them God reaches out to them God wants them all to be saved if he went to the trouble that he went to for Nebuchadnezzar and he went to the same trouble even more so in the case of Herod then I am convinced\n\n(1:57:41) that he will do the same for these presidents don't misunderstand me I'm just discussing a historic scenario so spiritism forms part and parcel of the way in which government is enacted because under the Reagan administration they used astrology and divination to determine how they were going to run\n\n(1:58:07) things when they were going to meet what days that were going to do what everything ran according to a knockout calendar that's common history everybody knows it and how we have out of the horse's mouth that the Secretary of State receives instruction from a deceased individual probably also as to how to run affairs of state now Lauren's\n\n(1:58:31) our Rick the 18th Superior General of the Society of Jesus is a fascinating man because he ruled from 1773 to 1814 which means that he also ruled in the time period when the first beast received a mortal wound and it is fascinating that the black papacy also received a mortal wound because it was apparently fanned and\n\n(1:59:01) disbanded but then had a resurrection just like the white papacy now during the order suppression from 1773 to 1814 by Pope Clement general Ricci created the Illuminati with his soldiers he didn't go underground because he was to be destroyed he went underground because it was convenient remember that the\n\n(1:59:29) first peace seemed to have a mortal wound it doesn't say it had a mortal wound it seemed to have a mortal wound I don't I saw the father of modern communism who was with the jacobeans who wear the little hat who may rules subservient to the system conducted the French Revolution years later Jesuit general leader Chavez gave this one with\n\n(1:59:59) his Bolsheviks conducted the Russian Revolution 1917 it being identical to the upheaval of 1789 history of the Jesuits so who fermented this tremendous political upheaval the Jesuits behind the scenes they are the secret rulers of evil ex quarter mala Bishop and this man actually is a Canadian today he lives in\n\n(2:00:33) Canada East claims Jesuits are the spiritual controllers of the New World Order and this is what he has to say I'm quoting now some sources view I quoted rulers of evil now I'm quoting a Catholic bishop former bishop Gareth Beaufort of Guatemala said the Vatican is the real spiritual controller of the Illuminati and the new\n\n(2:01:02) world order while the Jesuits threw the black Pope Jesuit general friar Peter hunts Calvin ba who is now no longer the general so he wrote this a little while ago the president was Adolfo nicolÃ¡s but they're both still alive actually control the Vatican hierarchy and the Roman Catholic Church Bishop fr who left the church and is now\n\n(2:01:24) born-again Christian living in Canada based his conclusion of the working six years as Vatican priests assigned the task of passing daily sensitive correspondence between the Pope and the leaders of the Jesuit Order residing at Bordeaux Santo Spirito five near st. Peter's Square yes the man known as the\n\n(2:01:47) black Pope controls all major decisions made by the Pope and he in turn controls the Illuminati said bishop of fog last week on greg Szymanski's radio show the investigative journalist and soul where archives of the startling statements can be heard in the entirely I know this to be true since I worked four years in the\n\n(2:02:08) Vatican and traveled with Pope John Paul the second the Pope takes his marching orders from the black Pope as the Jesuits also are the leaders of the New World Order with the task of infiltrating other religions and governments of the world in order to bring about a one-world fascist government and a one world religion\n\n(2:02:27) based on Satanism and Lucifer now in case someone says I'm a conspiracies I didn't say it he said people can't imagine how evil and how much destruction they have caused and will cause while at the same time using the perfect cover of hiding behind black robes and professing to be men of God and just want to ask a question is what\n\n(2:02:54) we read here in harmony with what we read out of the great controversy yes not and that is the final question if we can say that that book must go to the world then why is it that we war against what that book has to say this is the Church of the Gesu Italian kids or del gesÃ¹ and notice that it is a G and in\n\n(2:03:23) Freemasonry the letter inside is a G which has many meanings the naive will say it means God no it will tell you who the real man is behind the power and in that chapel you have the famous statue of the church with a what is that in the hand over here a lightning bolts who carried the lightning bolt in our first little\n\n(2:03:53) picture it was Marduk who carried it and with his lightning bolt through that power of that divinity which is a transcript of Kane who received the power from Anu with that power she will destroy Protestantism this is Lutheran Calvo and that is a mission if that were not her mission today why doesn't she cover up\n\n(2:04:20) this little statue why does she leave it there see my lord from this room from this room I governed not only Paris but China not only China but the whole world without anyone knowing how that's managed Michelangelo tamburini the 1728 general of the Jesuits speaking to the Duke of Bronchos revelation 17 verse 15 says and he says\n\n(2:04:43) unto the me the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's and multitudes and nations and tongues how much does she control everything so what happens in China what happens in Japan what happens in Korea is what's supposed to happen to channel people into a mindset one mindset which will finally\n\n(2:05:10) come into direct conflict with another mindset because this is the battle for the mind does she control the secret police of the world the answer is yes the CIA was formed by Catholic knight of Malta William Wild Bill Donovan he's considered the father of the CIA the FBI was also formed by a knight of Malta trustee of the Catholic\n\n(2:05:40) University of America when Loyola was traveling with the permission of the Pope to Jerusalem a knight of Malta a high General of the Knights of Malta was with him on the ship and Loyola received the secrets of the power structure directly from the Knights of Malta so the two are really one today that's\n\n(2:06:06) history you can check it out the grand design exposed the truth is the Jesuits of Rome have perfected Freemasonry to be their most magnificent and effective tool accomplishing their purpose among Protestants so in Protestant nations the Freemason organizations all feel very comfortable but the stop structure is subject to\n\n(2:06:31) someone they don't even know who it is and that someone is the black Pope in Rome Malachi Martin who was strangely removed from this planet said it is a strange phenomenon in history of the Roman Church that every time there is a crisis of extraordinary value new Masonic orders are called forth and that\n\n(2:06:54) is how the Jesuit came into being it took over the top structure it received it as a gift it was the new ruler on this planet so if you go to the Capitol it is a temple of Jupiter and on top of it says the goddess and it's interesting that the Capitol on Venus this great statue in Rome that was removed only\n\n(2:07:22) once during the French Revolution from Rome when the papacy received a mortal wound was recently sent to Washington as a symbol of their unity and Washington of course laid the cornerstone Masonic Lee now this is the great Scottish Rite of Freemasonry Supreme Council 33 degrees now it is a museum but parts of it are\n\n(2:07:52) open to the public but as you all know we are a little bit naughty my friend in the back there and I and so while they were showing us around we managed to sneak off into other places but this is where the great leaders actually meet after their decisions are made in the Senate's and other places and the real\n\n(2:08:20) power is determined over here so we took some pictures that were not part of the tour and what do you see as you come in there you see the sign of a new as worn by some ash and mud Duke this is in this Lodge where the leadership of the United States meets now we're just going to go through and you see its symbol over\n\n(2:08:50) there which is the symbol of power here's the Supreme Court of the United States what is the symbol that you see on the wall over there it's the exact same symbol we our rulers over the powers of evil and we will keep them in check we will make laws and we will make everybody subject to our laws but the\n\n(2:09:20) supreme leaders also have another criterion they are in conflict with God and were the followers of God and their intent eventually is always to get rid of Abel or to get rid of the children of Israel or to get rid of the Prince of Peace or to get rid of those who followed the Prince of Peace or to get rid of the\n\n(2:09:46) remnant of the remnant do you see the picture throughout history is there any reason why it shouldn't repeat itself so the sign of an O is on the Supreme Court of the United States of America now I'll take you down into the places where they didn't take us welcome to the J Edgar Hoover room dedicated to your law enforcement\n\n(2:10:11) community and then there's something written here which is hard to read unless you carefully look at it so I wrote it out for you the most effective weapon against crime is cooperation the effort of all law enforcement agency with the support and understanding of the American people who wields the sword\n\n(2:10:31) the United States of America on behalf of whom on behalf of the first peace the secular power is subject to the spiritual power FBI activities began under mr. Hoover's era and there are some of the examples and just to make sure you know what went on with him he must have been at least the 32 degree Freemason because he's a\n\n(2:10:58) shrine and you have to be a 32 degree freemason to be that but he was probably 33 so there is it's interesting that he has the symbol of the the moon and the star we think it is Islam it has nothing to do with it this is the symbol of Isis and Horus it is that symbol of power given by that first parent given by Cain\n\n(2:11:23) and his wife to their son you know and down through the line through masonry according to pike who traces their history back to the power of enough to rule here is shaking hands with the President of the United States eisenhower our new cities are they builders of cities yes very much so who's this gentleman this\n\n(2:11:59) is taken in that Lodge by the way in that room in that room in that Lodge that's Billy Graham shaking hands with Hoover there is with the Pope and he declared the Pope to be the moral leader of the world is that Jehu bowing down yes or no and here you have norman vincent peale 33 degree freemason took this picture\n\n(2:12:35) myself down there in the 33 degree Washington Lodge this is the father of the modern mega church this is the father of the modern methodology used in the church who's he subject to Rome says that the temporal power is subject to the spiritual power and that spiritual power resides in Rome he's the father of\n\n(2:13:00) the megachurch movement he was the mentor of Robert Schuller who became the mentor of Hybels and of Rick Warren and the whole plethora of modern theology comes out of this temple Lodge here is Harry Truman 33 degree Freemason and there is the altar inside that shrine now if you look at that altar it's a\n\n(2:13:33) replica of what it's a replica of the altar of offering that was used by the Hebrews but on top of it is not only the Bible but the bhagavad-gita the Tanakh the Quran and the Bible what does that symbolize that all religions will be fused into one so is this children of obedience or children of disobedience is this a way\n\n(2:14:03) to God of your own devising or the way the truth and the life nobody comes to the Father except by me well we can see that quite clearly Alice a Bailey founders of Lucifer Trust said there will be no dissociation between the universal Church the sacred lodge of all true Masons and the inner circle of\n\n(2:14:24) the esoteric societies in this way the goals and the work of the United Nations will be solidified and a new church of God led by all the religions and by all the spiritual groups shall put to an end the great heresy of separateness so if the Bible says come up and be separate and have nothing to do with this kind of\n\n(2:14:44) worship they say the opposite so these are rulers of evil another 33 degree Freemason we senator Doe and here you have Burke showing that the military power is also under their control this is all taken directly from the pictures hanging down there and we also happen to step on the holy ground of Albert Pike's\n\n(2:15:16) grave and they were horrified oh you're standing on holy ground what's the holy about that Pike is here [Music] unbelievable then Stein noted that the leading American players behind Reagan Vatican conspiracy to a man were devout Roman Catholics namely William Casey now this book was written in 1971 those\n\n(2:15:42) rulers of evil I just want you to note the names and see where these people or some of them are today William Casey was then that time director of the CIA Richard Allen national security adviser national security adviser and hi Secretary of State ambassador at large when Walters ambassador to the Vatican\n\n(2:16:04) Wilson but the reporter neglected to mention that the entire Senate Foreign Relations Committee was governed by Roman Catholics as well especially Joe Biden wizzy today Subcommittee on European fairs Paul sabonis international economic policy in oceans and environment when John Kerry where is he today terrorism narcotics\n\n(2:16:28) and international communications was his portfolio then so do they control very interesting aspects fascinating and of course they were bones men as we know now people will start shouting conspiracy there's no conspiracy there's a fact this is not conspiracy now let's have a look at some modern people Leon\n\n(2:16:53) Panetta he was the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency Leon Edward Panetta is an American politician lawyer and professor he served in a Barack Obama's administration as director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 2009 to 11 and a secretary of defense from 2011 to 2013 in 1956 he entered Santa Clara\n\n(2:17:15) University and in 1960 he graduated magna laude with a Bachelor arts and political side he also received the Juris Doctor from Santa Clara University he joined the United States Army etcetera etc etc he receives the army commendation medal and was discharged in 1966 as first lieutenant so running these mighty organizations we have Roman\n\n(2:17:42) Catholic agents al Jazeera says the dangerous rebranding of John Brennan he's the current director of the CIA now where is he get his training how does this happen how can a constitutional law professor and community activist and a Jesuit trained intelligent analyst with an interest in Just War Theory so easily\n\n(2:18:03) distort language etc etc are really interested in the details who controls him his Jesuit trained well Clinton was Jesuit trained the CIA the FBI to this day they were founded by agents of Rome and today agents of Rome are controlling them today nothing has changed the Tower of Babel and here you have the Queen of Heaven and her\n\n(2:18:33) little child Horace on the Tower of Babel Rome makes note that makes no secret of its affiliations he dissociates itself with the Tower of Babel she's the quaint queen of Babel God divided the nation's and it's been satan's aim to reunite them in apostasy against God and we are heading for that final apostasy the European Parliament\n\n(2:19:04) building is nothing other than a reconstruction of the Tower of Babel this was at the London Olympics there you had the five rings of the Olympics which symbolise the union of the five continents a one-world government but it's not complete until the capstone comes down on it and who's the goddess of the night\n\n(2:19:30) Isis and so they planned it precisely according to the astrological and astronomical column calendar so that the full moon would rise and join the rings to complete the pyramids and whether it's inverted or whether it's upright makes no difference the one is the malefactor the other one is the female\n\n(2:19:55) factor the world is coming to the point who win this one world unity which will be in opposition to God is coming into effect this is the journal America the National Catholic Review it is a Jesuit journal so let's ask the Jesuits to explain who the president of the European Council today is he was educated at the Catholic University of\n\n(2:20:24) Leuven which is dedicated to Mary the mother of Jesus under a traditional attribute the seat of wisdom we'll have to talk about that now let's see what the Jesuit journal has to say one interesting thing about mr. Romm Phan rompe is his Catholicism about which he makes no Bonz he was educated the rum roll civil\n\n(2:20:46) play by Jesuits in Brussels the top leaders in the world are Jesuits or Jesuit trained they wield the power this is the emblem of Georgetown University was taken directly from their web page the scene of Georgetown University it bears the founding date 1789 the University our motto throught unum both\n\n(2:21:15) into one and Latin inscription Collegium giorgio platinum at the repast whatever which means Georgetown College on the banks of the Potomac in Maryland this is where the presidents get educated this is where the legislators get educated they have the Roman Eagle and it says both into one if you check a little bit\n\n(2:21:43) further on their web page they will lie to you or on other web pages about this and they will say to you oh this is the dividing line between the Jew and the Gentile that has been taken away and they have been united nonsense this is the union of church and state the union of church and state this is what will be\n\n(2:22:11) achieved whether we like it or not and it will be under the auspices of the Roman Eagle and that is why there's a holy Alliance which was formed between the two and the ego forms part of the Pontifex Maximus assemble on the very seat of his power I took that picture in the Vatican on the floor as you enter\n\n(2:22:37) some Peters and there is the emblem and this is the symbol of the United States of America and it has exactly the same thing here it says in Latin he God favored our undertaking and a new order of the ages you know these things here is the symbol of the eagle in Rome under the papal keys on the coin of the\n\n(2:23:02) Vatican and here is the famous eagle as it is in the garden of the Vatican sculpted by paul v now this is a statement that some say he never made but many claim that he did make it and even if he didn't make it exactly like that this is found in others of his writings almost like this so we can say it's quite Authority Woodrow Wilson\n\n(2:23:28) wrote I'm the most unhappy man I have unwittingly ruined my country a great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit our system of credit is concentrated the growth of the nation therefore in all our activities on the hands of a few men we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most\n\n(2:23:50) completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and Duras of a small group of dominant men and he said that after he signed into law the federal reserve now this is the Globe\n\n(2:24:15) and Mail Business Report 10 September 2013 the CEOs of some of the world's top mining companies did not come to the Vatican to pray see Pope Francis or traipse through the sweltering halls of the Vatican Museum they came to discuss ways to make their industry a little bit less devilish and you have to give the\n\n(2:24:40) Vatican credit for all-star drawing power any mining conference would have been envious of the guestlist Saturday is day of reflection with the mining industry which was organized by the Pontifical Council for justice and peace the Vatican department that deals with earthly matters such as promoting human\n\n(2:24:56) rights included the C and O's CEOs of Anglo American PLC area tented in newmont mining these three men alone represented companies with well more than 100 billion US dollars in market value discussions taking place at the Vatican Bilderberg 2000 and work in 13 welcome to 1984 of the 59 years of Bilderberg\n\n(2:25:24) guests scuttling through the shadows ducking lenses etc etc here they come and there is this lady Acharya who is the IMF boss today she's above the burka in my previous lecture I showed that the bulgar burgers were formed and started by the Jesuits now here's an interview which is rather fascinating and this\n\n(2:25:53) interview if we can have the sound up in a moment this interview is with a whistleblower now what's the blower's are causing quite a bit of trouble for the current regimes and this is no ordinary whistleblower this was one of the advisory lawyers in the international monetary form this is one of the\n\n(2:26:14) whistleblowers who blew the whistle on multi billion frauds and eventually for whistleblowing she got a pink slip then let's listen to what this person were there in fact within the financial systems of the world has come up with in her thinking hello I'm Greg hunter welcome to us a watchdog calm with us\n\n(2:26:35) today a brand new guest her name is karen buddhist she is an attorney she is a baker and she is a whistle blower karen buddhist thank you so much for joining us today from maryland thank you so much well you work for the world bank for a better part of twenty years you are a Ivy League trained attorney you\n\n(2:26:55) are with the Ivy League school are you with the Yale you you work for the World Bank as a lawyer you're a banker and you were a whistleblower inside the World Bank not just one time but several times a crescendo do with a big almost a billion dollar you know whistleblowing fraud malfeasance in the World Bank in\n\n(2:27:13) Indonesia and for that you got a pink slip in 2009 getting back to the Federal Reserve and the Bank for International Settlements these groups are in cahoots with the biggest crooks of all the Jesuits that bought a Bank of America and they have little secret deals to try to apportion the riches of the world and in the\n\n(2:27:39) meantime all of the countries of the world know that this thievery is going on we are talking about the biggest thuggery of all and that is the Jesuits in the Vatican and let me tell you what I just found out I always thought that the CIA was the problem and the you know the other intelligence agencies guess\n\n(2:28:01) what there's a grand intelligence agency that the Vatican puts out and all of those other crooks are operating under the Vatican intelligence agency the money is though not the money is about the control and the the Vatican intelligence agency the world intelligence agent about we're fighting over money over what money we're gonna\n\n(2:28:20) use that controls the money I'm saying Greg they're not fighting they've all agreed the fighting is what we're led to believe they're all in cahoots just like all the banks are in boots all of these intelligence agencies are in cahoots to for example people don't know that they're IRS revenue is going\n\n(2:28:41) to the Vatican now there's a whistleblower and I don't think she's a fool I think she saw through it Pope John the 23rd made the following statement the Mark of Cain is stamped upon our foreheads across the country is our brother Abel was slain in the blood which we drew and shed tears we caused by forgetting thy love forgive us Lord\n\n(2:29:12) for the curse we falsely attributed to their name as Jews forgive us for crucifying the second time in their flesh for we knew not what we did now lest I be accused of being an anti-semite I am not lest I be accused of being an anti-catholic I am NOT I'm anteye anyone I'm just Pro Jesus Christ but he claims the Mark of Cain is\n\n(2:29:45) stamped upon their foreheads he's a stating effect he knows it they have the Mark of Cain they have the authority to rule and they are exercising the authority and what he says is that they slew Abel all over again in the form of the Jews but they want to be forgiven for that does he ask forgiveness for the inquisition and the\n\n(2:30:12) slaughter of millions of Christians no because those who reject Christ a part of his mindset so all that he has done in the statement has said the Mark of Cain is on upon our phorid and we welcome into our midst anyone who has the same enmity against Jesus Christ that's what he's saying but they're clever they hide it under this\n\n(2:30:43) language so that you will not see it Netanyahu thanks the Pope for Jewish exoneration soper Benedict went a step further and exonerated them from the guilt of the crucifixion he's very kind he wields the power he has the mark of Adam he can do it sundae's them our mark of authority the churches above the Bible and this\n\n(2:31:14) transference of Sabbath observance is proof of that fact Catholic record a person who violates the sanctity of Sunday is to be punished as a heretic john paul ii the EU must keep Sunday says the Catholic Church is it directing its attention against God's law and a public domain yes honor Catholic Church\n\n(2:31:42) and trade unions from holy Alliance to a forced Sunday observance let me take it down into the bellows of that 33 degree Lodge in Washington and this is Albert Pike's room he is revered as a god down there everything is meticulous and there in one on the windows it says Ordo AB Chao order out of chaos we know that he\n\n(2:32:18) planned Albert Pike planned three world wars in a letter to Mancini we shall unleash the nihilism the atheist and we shall provoke a formidable social Cataclysm which in its horror will show clearly that to the nation's the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and the most bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens\n\n(2:32:40) obliged to defend themselves against the minority of revolutionists will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude disillusioned with Christianity will receive the pure light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer the destruction of Christianity and atheism both conquered\n\n(2:32:59) and exterminated at the same time here is the gigantic mural in the United Nations Security Council chamber and there you see the fur necks rising out of the ashes of a destroyed mankind are we heading for the final clash two lines the rule of law and the rule of the Spirit this is now a definition from\n\n(2:33:33) legal dictionary the rule of law according to law rule under law rule according to a higher law the rule of law is ambiguous term that can mean different things in different contexts in one context the terms means rule according to the law no individual can be ordered by the government to pay civil damages or suffer criminal\n\n(2:33:53) punishment except in strict accordance with the well established and clearly defined laws and procedures and in the second context the term means rule under law now branch of is above the law no public official may act arbitrary or unilaterally outside the law in a third context the term means rule according to a higher law no\n\n(2:34:12) written law may be enforced by a governor unless it conforms with certain unwritten universal principles of fairness morality and justice that transcend human legal systems and whenever that lawyers there must be natural law and who wields natural law Road Rome is the father and the mother of natural law so she controls all law\n\n(2:34:37) she has the Mark of Cain and she says the sign that I have this authority in the world a god-given authority by the way God permits that to bear that responsibility is my mark of power and that is that I changed the Sabbath to Sunday now we've all seen this one before but I just want to emphasize the\n\n(2:35:07) words rule of law let's hear the Sun for institutions of freedom have lain dormant the United Nations can offer them new life these institutions play a crucial role in our quest for a new world order in order in which no nation must surrender one iota of its own sovereignty an order characterized by\n\n(2:35:34) the rule of law rather than a resort to force everybody must be subject to the what the rule of law and the rule of law is subject to a higher law and that law is wielded by another authority behind the scenes that's the legal definition the only one who has ever laid claim to such a law is the Roman Catholic Church and so\n\n(2:36:03) principalities and powers will have to come and pay abeyance and so Obama will go he was educated at Harvard if you enter the Harvard Law School what is the sign that you see there the sign of Honor so here is the power to rule Battlefield u.s. Americans face arrest as war criminals on the army state law\n\n(2:36:29) Luke 21:26 men's hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken we are heading for a final Cataclysm Senate approves indefinite detention and torture of Americans the terrifying legislation that allows for Americans to\n\n(2:36:51) be arrested detained indefinitely tortured and interrogated without charge or trial passed through the Senate on Thursday is it only applicable to Americans or is the same thing happening to other nations as well do they use torture at Guantanamo Bay yes or no is it a common known fact do they use waterboarding and other\n\n(2:37:14) methods that we don't know well why would the US clergy seek release of a Senate report on post 9/11 torture if there weren't torture and I want to remind you of history it did the nations in the past employed torture to those who differed from their principles yes or no did their Syrians do it yes and if\n\n(2:37:41) you go down the line did the Romans do it yes and whenever it came to that point once they reach a certain point seventy times seven when probation closes for them it is but normally these nations became cruel and tortured people are they showing pictures of people in terrible states with chemicals on them\n\n(2:38:08) and all kinds of stuff like that who supplies these things who makes it possible for them to use it whoever reduces I'm not interested in who is using it I'm not accusing anyone I'm saying that the children are evil of children who rule over the children of evil are using the methodologies which the Bible describes throughout history\n\n(2:38:32) and we are at that point in history did Obama sign a martial law executive orders folks headed to happy hour last Friday President Obama signed an executive order that could potentially given the part of Institutional martial law even in a time of peace Verizon forced to hand over telephone data full court ruling are you being\n\n(2:38:56) watched did Herod have a secret police force that dragged any dissident to justice which he was permitted to to bring about absolutely are we at that same point in history there's only one little difference all those others serve this type and they were all local but this one is universal this is the last one\n\n(2:39:30) Huntington post denounces george w obama it's beautiful there they have George Bush and there you have a bomber listening to your conversations and they fuse the two brilliantly into george w obama what does that picture say the picture says it doesn't make any difference whether it's the one ruling\n\n(2:39:58) or the other the same power behind the sea controls them both when Obama came to power I screamed about all the irregularities and terrible laws that the previous one had made did he rescind one no not one God's Word has given warning of the impending danger let this be unheeded and the Protestant world\n\n(2:40:23) will learn what the purposes of Rome really are again I purposely choose great controversy because we as a people believe that this must be given to the world only when it is too late to escape the snare she's silently growing into power her doctrines are exerting their influence in legislative halls in the\n\n(2:40:49) churches and in the hearts of men she's piling up her lofty and massive structures in the secret recesses of which her former persecutions will be repeated I don't want to speak about FEMA camps and this and that and the other I don't care how many bunkers they build or how many camps they both I know\n\n(2:41:08) one thing that the confrontation will be between the powers of evil and the powers of good and the only power that can control the power of evil is Jesus Christ himself and I am but a pawn in this game that I can choose sides I can choose sides and the rod can spare me from the sword if he so wishes and\n\n(2:41:33) even if he doesn't he can resurrect me but the other one can't stealthily and unsuspectedly she is strengthening her forces to further our own ends when the time shall come for her to strike my church is basking in the sunshine of her acceptance sitting in the sunshine moving a little feets in ecstasy don't you know where\n\n(2:42:09) you are sitting don't you know it can happen to you don't you know that you can be grabbed at any moment all that she desires is vantage-ground and this was already being given a we shall soon see and shall feel what the purpose of the roman element is whoever shall believe in obey the Word of God will\n\n(2:42:33) thereby encourage proach and persecution make no bones about it on the same day that President Obama called for a new international order to solve the challenges of our time probability called for a new international order both of them are accustomed to interesting hand signs as we see with both hands Time magazine the\n\n(2:43:01) new world pope meet the press' jesuit priest and ignacio's press found that joseph SEO said those who repel against the church's authentic teaching or rebelling against god rebelling against which god revelation 19:15 and out of the mouth out of his mouth goes a sharp sword that with it he should smite the\n\n(2:43:26) nation's and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God 1 Corinthians 15:20 4 note this text then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and\n\n(2:43:51) all power they are permitted to rule they have been granted by God the Mark of Cain they can exercise their power to a limit which God sets and when that limit comes he ends it he's done it through history we've looked at it and we at the point when the same principles that applied to the close of probation\n\n(2:44:16) in all the other kingdoms are coming to a head in our time if people do not want to see it that's their business but it is my duty my duty to make them aware of the danger that they are in and I appeal to my church and I appeal to the world to look at the Protestant heritage and to look at what we taught as a church\n\n(2:44:41) and to warn the people of the coming danger rather than cuddling up to that it is now time to make a decision and may God help us to make the right one amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]"
